<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles A. Berst1 IN THE BEGINNING: THE POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD An interesting aspect of the essays to follow is that they start with Shaw at age forty-two, and, apart from Shaw's contributions and a biographi- cal episode of his later years, they focus on his plays. Yet in proposing this volume no guidelines other than "Shaw and Religion" were set: no topics were assigned, no specific papers solicited. Therefore while the emphasis of these essays on the later G.B.S. may be mere chance, possibly they reflect a certain frame of mind among Shavian scholars. This could consist of several factors. First, Shaw emerged most signally as a religious dramatist with Man and Superman in 1903, and the plays which follow and immediately precede this event seem most pertinent to his mature views. Second, the taste of literary scholars runs more to drama than philosophy or theology. And third, there is perhaps some consensus that the development of Shaw's philosophical thought has been well covered in recent fine studies of the subject by Alfred Turco, Jr., and Robert F. Whitman.2 To introduce this volume, however, I believe that a stage should be set, or at least a backdrop provided, for Shaw the religious playwright. In attempting this I wish to point up an ingredient in his philosophical background which has heretofore been underplayed or overlooked: my assertion is that Shaw derived his religious views less from formal philo- sophical thought than from art. His religious beginnings took very little shape outside the realm of art. While he was indebted to numerous philosophers, he experienced religion largely in poetic terms. And for Shaw experience was the grindstone of thought. His religious views first formed in an aesthetic response to life; later he gave personal life to abstract ideas by finding them in the art of others; and finally he ex- plored and realized his ideas in his own art. Thus in the whole process from conception to germination to expression, aesthetics played a more strategic role than philosophy. Furthermore, central to his religious de-</page><page sequence="2">6 CHARLES A. BERST velopment was his perception of himself in relation to God. On these grounds this essay serves as a springboard for the rest of the volume: it starts in the beginning, traces Shaw's engagements with divinity, and, finally, having probed the aesthetics as well as the theology of these engagements, ends with an open door to the plays. Shaw forthrightly acknowledged many sources of his thought. Per- haps his most famous listing is an oft-cited one in the Epistle Dedica- tory to Man and Superman: "Bunyan, Blake, Hogarth, and Turner (these four apart and above all the English classics), Goethe, Shelley, Schopenhauer, Wagner, Ibsen, Morris, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche are among the writers whose peculiar sense of the world I recognize as more or less akin to my own. Mark the word peculiar. I read Dickens and Shakespear without shame or stint; but their pregnant observa- tions and demonstrations of life are not coordinated into any philoso- phy or religion."3 Here is fertile territory indeed; perhaps almost too fertile. In sorting through this richness, most scholars who deal with Shaw's thought have emphasized his indebtedness to the philosophical and social ideas of Ibsen, Wagner, and Schopenhauer, to whom, among others, they have added Hegel, Mill, and Butler. But with the exception of one critic who focuses briefly on Blake,4 there is a striking imbalance in their selection. Doubling over to allow for double talents in a few cases, observe the primary areas of genius of the figures Shaw cites: one is an allegorist, one a caricaturist, one a painter, one an artist-socialist, one a novelist, one a musician, two are playwrights, two are philosophers, and six are poets. In toto, aesthetics apply primarily to ten, philosophy to only two. Considering this, is it balanced to assume that philosophy is foremost in Shaw's "peculiar sense of the world"? Clearly philosophy is important, as Shaw's comments on Dickens' and Shakespeare's lack of it reveal, but he appears to respond to it most closely when it is an ingredient of art. Perhaps some of the tendency to focus on Shaw's religion more in terms of philosophic prose than poetry or mysticism results from the less rational, more elusive nature of the latter. The ghosts of Cesare Lombroso, who linked genius with madness, and Max Nordau, who linked artistic genius with decadence, linger on. And, for the orthodox, to link religion primarily to poetry smacks of irreverent sophistry. At any rate, the subject is difficult to handle. But one must face up to the fact that Shaw proclaimed, "I am, and always have been, a mystic."3 And if there is a philosopher to whom he is even closer than Schopen- hauer or Hegel it is Bergson, the philosopher of intuition, whose Ã©lan vital he frequently equated to the Life Force, and whom he called "the established philosopher of my sect."6 Strangely enough, a book on Shaw and Bergson is yet to be written.</page><page sequence="3">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 7 More interesting than Shaw's indebtedness to a multitude of sources, however, are the ways in which he incorporated their ideas into a personal metaphysics, orchestrating their various themes to his particu- lar overture. When he engages the genius of others he commonly pushes beyond mere rationalism. His focus is on the unconventional, the imaginative, the inspired. In earthly terms he grasps the social and socialistic insights of his sources, but, except for a few years in his young manhood, he even deals with such matters in terms of a spiritual thrust which is permeated with a poetic sensibility. Habitually his eye moves beyond the social to the spiritual, and at this point he finds that spirit, mind, and aesthetics go together. In his preface to Androcles and the Lion he observes that "Belief is literally a matter of taste." The idea is simple but penetrating. He follows this with an even more telling comment: "The thing [a man] believes may be true, but that is not why he believes it; he believes it because in some mysterious way it appeals to his imagination" {Plays, IV, 510, 511). Those with profound imagina- tions, such as the great poets, have profound beliefs. On the other hand, "The mass of mankind must have something to worship that the senses can apprehend." Finally, "no two men can have exactly the same faith unless they have exactly the same mental capacity."' A passage in Shaw's preface to Plays Pleasant is not untypical of his linking of genius, art, and spiritual insight. Introducing Candida, he contrasts "the higher but vaguer and timider vision" of Marchbanks with "the clear, bold, sure, sensible, benevolent, salutarily shortsighted Christian Socialist idealism" of Morell. In embracing socialism and reli- gion the parson combines qualities Shaw admires; but the poet in Marchbanks probes toward a higher spirit. Shaw likens Marchbanks' poetic struggle to that of the religious art of the Middle Ages: To distil the quintessential drama from pre-Raphaelitism, medieval or modern, it must be shewn at its best in conflict with the first broken, nervous, stumbling attempts to formulate its own revolt against itself as it develops into something higher. A coherent explanation of any such revolt, addressed intelligibly and prosaically to the intellect, can only come when the work is done, and indeed done with: that is to say, when the development, accomplished, admitted, and assimilated, is a story of yesterday. Long before any such understanding can be reached, the eyes of men begin to turn towards the distant light of the new age. Discerni- ble at first only by the eyes of the man of genius, it must be focussed by him on the speculum of a work of art, and flashed back from that into the eyes of the common man. Nay, the artist himself has no other way of making himself conscious of the ray: it is by a blind instinct that he keeps on building up his masterpieces until their pinnacles catch the glint of the unrisen sun. [Plays, I, 373-74]</page><page sequence="4">8 CHARLES A. BERST Here a striving artistic consciousness is the primary Life Force vehicle: prose and intellect follow its revelation. As examples Shaw cites Wagner, Blake, Shelley, and Ibsen, in company with Tintoretto and Rembrandt, Mozart and Beethoven. Most importantly, he is not talking about the social writings of these four poets; rather, he exalts them as artists. Lighting the way for their revolutionary social views is the genius of their creative talents. The instinctive artist provides a vision for the ascent of man. To fully appreciate this vision in Shaw one must go to his beginnings, and, with wry aptness, a key to his beginning is in Saint John's poetic account of Genesis. John's gospel was Shaw's favorite, and in later years he frequently cited its first chapter, verses one and fourteen: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. . . . And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us ... full of grace and truth." In the dialogue between Jesus and Pilate which prefaces On the Rocks Shaw has Jesus paraphrase this, and in his post- script to Back to Methuselah (1944) he explicates it in Shavian terms: "the Creative Evolutionist believes firmly in Providence and in what used to be called the will of God. . . . Instead of dwelling morbidly on the quite unedifying and not too interesting inference that in the beginning the earth was a wisp of blazing gas torn off from the sun, the votary of Creative Evolution goes back to the old and very pregnant lesson that in the beginning was the Thought; and the Thought was with God; and the Thought was God, the Thought being what the Greeks meant by 'the Word'. He believes in the thought made flesh as the first step in the main process of Creative Evolution. He believes in a new Jerusa- lem, and resolves, like Blake, that he will not cease from mental fight nor shall his sword sleep in his hand till he has built that paradise in England's green and pleasant land" {Plays, V, 698). For Shaw, thought was a necessary first principle in the universe. But his concluding metaphor from Blake suggests that while thought is the first step in Creative Evolution, when it comes to man it translates into inspired metaphor. Considering his own life, Shaw time and again gives credit to instinct and inspiration before thought. For example: "I am not governed by principles; I am inspired, how or why I cannot explain"; and later: "When I am writing a play I never invent a plot: I let the play write itself and shape itself, which it always does even when up to the last moment I do not foresee the way out. Sometimes I do not see what the play was driving at until quite a long time after I have finished it; and even then I may be wrong about it just as any critical third party may."8 Shaw's Earth Mother, Lilith, while aiming at pure intelligence, starts as "a whirlpool in pure force" {Plays, V, 630), and so, seemingly, did Shaw. Typically he wrote his plays first, his prefaces afterward.</page><page sequence="5">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 9 Actually the Biblical key is more instructive than Shaw makes it. He takes the Greek original of John's "Word," which is "Logos" - reason, in its aspect as the controlling principle of the universe. But he fails to complete its meaning: it is not only a controlling principle, it is mani- fested by speech. Hence the Christian "Word," or Jesus, the second person in the Trinity - being the Word made flesh, Jesus is the entity who articulates God. Such articulation goes beyond speech: exegetes have pointed out that it is also God in action, creating (Gen. 1.3; Ps. 33.6), revealing (Amos 3.7-8), and redeeming (Ps. 107. 19-20).9 Taken altogether, the Word made flesh and manifest as articulation, creation, revelation, and redemption is nothing less than an ultimate metaphor; and, curiously enough, all of these qualities apply to Shaw's aesthetic and spiritual impulses and to his Life Force in action. In sum, in the beginning was the Metaphor - and so, in most strategic spiritual ways, it was with Shaw. The genesis of Shaw's Word may be found not in any philosopher but in elements of his boyhood which he conceived metaphorically and which in fact formed metaphoric patterns that remained with him all his life. When he reminisces about his family's shabby gentility, its snobbery, the humiliating alcoholism of his father, and his loveless mother, he most commonly images his youthful environment as a hell from which he sought refuge in reading, music, and his imagination. In Sixteen Self Sketches he inhabits this hell with "three fathers" - his ineffectual natural one, his blasphemous Rabelaisian uncle, Walter Gurly, and his mother's dynamic voice teacher, Vandeleur Lee (p. 14). For a seemingly drab childhood this was a remarkably evocative Trin- ity. Consider Shaw's response upon discovering that his father was habitually drunk: "It is a rhetorical exaggeration to say that I have never since believed in anything or anybody; but the wrench from my childish faith in my father as perfect and omniscient to the discovery that he was a hypocrite and a dipsomaniac was so sudden and violent that it must have left its mark on me." In contrast was Uncle Walter: "He was always in high spirits, and full of a humor that, though barbarous in its blasphemous indecency, was Scriptural and Shakes- pearean in the elaboration and fantasy of its literary expression." And, finally, there was Lee's virtually spiritual influence: "My moth- er's salvation came through music" (pp. 12-15). In short, as Shaw looked back on his childhood he perceived a metaphor whose pattern and values were to be permanently fixed in his imagination: set in the hell of a world of social hypocrisy was a defunct God, a high-spirited literary devil, and salvation in music. For a sensitive, imaginative soul the pattern had enduring psychological, aesthetic, and spiritual strength. It gives extra point to such future Shavian utterances as his</page><page sequence="6">10 CHARLES A. BERST comment to Tolstoy in 1910: "we none of us want to be like our fathers, the intention of the universe being that we shall be like God."10 Although a prime element of Shaw's gospel is that one must learn to engage reality vigorously, he admitted even at the end of his life that imaginative constructs were more real to him than life itself. He speaks of once having taken a word-association test: "When this Freudian technique was tried on me it failed because the words suggested always something fictitious. ... I was living in an imaginary world. Deeply as I was interested in politics, Hamlet and Falstaff were more alive to me than any living politician or even any relative. ... All I can plead is that as events as they actually occur mean no more than a passing crowd to a policeman on point duty, they must be arranged in some comprehen- sible order as stories" {Plays, VII, 384-85). As Shaw recalls his youth, this arranging process first took place almost musically in his nightly devotions: "In my childhood I exercised my literary genius by composing my own prayers. I cannot recall the words of the final form I adopted; but I remember that it was in three movements, like a sonata, and in the best Church of Ireland style. It ended with the Lord's Prayer; and I repeated it every night in bed. . . . I did not care whether my prayers were answered or not: they were a literary performance for the entertainment and propitiation of the Almighty."11 Thus Shaw's first substantial response to deity was an imaginative one, combining propitiation with instincts for literature, music, and entertainment. When he was almost ten his irreligious parents at last gave up the middle-class pretense of sending him to church (he hated church) and the prayers were abandoned, but not the imagination which had made entertainments of them. At about the same time Van- deleur Lee moved into the household, eclipsing Shaw's father, and Uncle Walter's blasphemy took ever greater hold. The aesthetic and religious effects of these events on Shaw were no doubt greater than his relief at leaving church and prayers behind. The debunked Father figure was overthrown, an energetic savior was providing Shaw with a gospel of music, and an attractive devil was playing in syncopation with his soul. His life, seemingly so drab, was charged with this microcosmic metaphor of macrocosmic archetypes - a metaphor which apparently stimulated his imagination, however half-consciously, because he re- sponded to it compulsively and in kind. Biographers have referred to the following passage as a curious, somewhat humorous fact. They have failed to engage its far more revealing nature as a strategic point at which metaphor became a way of life for Shaw:</page><page sequence="7">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 1 1 Even when I was a good boy I was so only theatrically, because, as actors say, I saw myself in the character; and this occurred very seldom, my taste running so strongly on stage villains and stage demons (I painted the whitewashed wall in my bedroom in Dalkey with watercolor frescoes of Mephistopheles) that I must have actually bewitched myself; for, when Nature completed my countenance in 1880 or thereabouts (I had only the tenderest sprouting of hair on my face until I was 24), I found myself equipped with the upgrowing moustaches and eyebrows, and the sarcastic nostrils of the operatic fiend whose airs (by Gounod) I had sung as a child, and whose attitudes I had affected in my boyhood. Later on, as the generations moved past me, I saw the fantasies of actors and painters come to life as living men and women, and began to perceive that imaginative fiction is to life what the sketch is to the picture or the conception to the statue. [Works, I, xxii- xxiii] This moves a significant step beyond Shaw's creative prayers. They had included religion, literary composition, musical form, and perfor- mance, ending with the Lord's Prayer as a ceremonial coda, all aimed at the propitiation of the Almighty. Their childish spirit welled forth from an ambiguous impulse half way between assertive aesthetics and a cringe. Now with church out of the way, a hypocritical father-figure exposed and dethroned, a prevailing gospel of music in the house, and Uncle Walter's appealing blasphemy setting an example, Shaw's spirit had more exciting stimulants. The result, captured in the quotation above, was a composite of actor, playwright, painter, musician, and arch rebel - all seeds for the later G.B.S. Shaw remarks that at the age of twelve "I was a Boy Atheist, and proud of it" (Self Sketches, pp. 23- 24). But even more important than the fact of his atheism was its aesthetic and psychological nature. While the boy prided himself on his rationalism, all signs are that he was propelled into his future course more by imaginative impulses and psychological need. Shaw's stultifying boyhood, from which he escaped only in reading, music, and his imagination, was capped by his four dreary years as a clerk in a Dublin estate agent's office. But once again external dullness was offset by a crescendo of internal poetry. As a boy he had absorbed the romantic glamor of Byron; however "when I was nearing twenty, Shelley got me; and I went into him head over heels and read every word he published. That was a sort of literary falling in love: Shelley's kingdom was not of this world for me."12 The last sentence is especially telling. So much has been written about Shaw's debt to Shelley's radical social views that his strong aesthetic and spiritual involvement with the poet has generally been overlooked. While he had little taste for Shelley's romanticizing about love, especially in Epipsychidion, Shaw's</page><page sequence="8">12 CHARLES A. BERST total absorption of Shelley in his late teens was one in which his per- sonal attitudes and social consciousness soared with Shelley's total sense of aesthetics, and this composite stayed with him. Near the end of his life he remarked: "It was Shelley who converted me to vegetarianism. I must have been the only man who took his poetry seriously, because it was mainly women who attended the Shelley Society. You see, vegetari- anism to Shelley, like marriage and atheism, was a form of poetry. I am always asked how it is that my opinions have changed so little since my youth. It is because I got to them by poetry. As I always say, the aesthetic is the most convincing and permanent. Shelley made his ideas sing; I made them dance."13 Via Shelley, Shaw perceived that an enlightened consciousness can be spiritual in atheistic terms. Referring to Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Rousseau, he comments: "It was then part of the education of a gentle- man to convince him that the three most religious men in Europe had been impious villains, and were roasting in blazing brimstone to all eternity. Shelley cured me of all that" (Self Sketches, p. 108). Most likely the greater the flexibility, capaciousness, and poetry of consciousness, the greater its essential spirituality, and Shaw's view in 1894 was that "In this century the world has produced two men - Shelley and Wagner - in whom intense poetic feeling was the permanent state of their consciousness."14 In such a light Shaw felt a special kinship to both: "I am a poet, essentially a poet. I lived in a time when poetry meant something to people. In my penurious days I carried a Shelley in my pocket and thought myself the wealthiest person in the world. That book was my talisman."10 Both early and late in Shaw's life this poetry was holy. In 1944 he wrote to Sister Laurentia McLachlan: "The saint who called me to the religious life when I was eighteen was Shelley."16 The religious impact of Shelley's spirit on Shaw clarified and broad- ened his rebellious impulses. From his instinctive Mephistopheleanism he moved toward the culture hero of Prometheus Unbound: Shelley had colorfully identified the orthodox, repressive Jehovah as the Almighty Fiend, and then gone on to promote humanism on a personal and social level. It was in this newly found culture-hero vein that Shaw first broke into print in 1875, late in his eighteenth year, with a letter to the editor of Public Opinion. Writing about the Dublin meetings of the American revivalists Moody and Sankey, Shaw spends less space on the preachers than on their little true spiritual effect on the audience. Here the young Promethean appears patiently and subversively, trying to civilize the uncivilized.17 Obviously significant in a life so fraught with religious ideas as Shaw's was is the fact that his first major literary effort was a "Passion Play."</page><page sequence="9">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 13 Although it is a somewhat crude piece of work, the play is arresting since it not only presents Shaw's early attitudes towards Christianity, but also reflects his biography, ethics, and sense of poetry. Yet most biographers and critics have passed it by. First published in a limited edition of 350 in 1971, it was not generally available until it appeared in Volume VII of the Bodley Head edition of the plays in 1974. 18 Shaw's manuscript is entitled "The Household of Joseph," but the editions have called it, simply, Passion Play. Written in 1878, when Shaw was twenty-one and barely two years in London, the play is in blank verse and unfinished. The manuscript in the British Library reveals that Shaw worked it over carefully before abandoning it in the middle of the second act. Act I is set in Nazareth. Scene I sketches Mary as a shrew, Joseph as drunken and brutal, Jesus's brother John as scholarly, prim, and pious, and Jesus (a bastard) as an honest, poetically disposed idealist with fervent spiritual impulses. Jesus is scorned by Mary as a good-for-nothing vagrant, disparaged by John for his bohemianism and unorthodox views, and defended by Joseph. A wealthy traveller, Judas Iscariot, drops by the family's carpenter shop to have a valuable cabinet repaired. Jesus, much to Mary's dis- gust, says that he and his family are too unskilled and would botch the job. Scene II takes place in a field that night. Judas comes across Jesus's girlfriend Rahab and briefly flirts with her. When Jesus enters and Judas suggests that the three of them go together Rahab huffs off, whereupon the two men converse. Their dialogue is the crux of the incomplete play: Judas, a rationalist and atheist, confronts the poetic man of faith. There are several remarkable aspects to this dialogue. Not only does it reveal a great deal about Shaw's spirit at the age of twenty-one, it also throws a strong light on the germination of so much of the G.B.S. of later years. And while the rationalistic Judas is the author's primary mouthpiece, both he and his author are impressed by Jesus's poetic spirituality. The conversation starts with Judas responding to Jesus's infatuation with Rahab. He disparages romantic notions about women and then moves into his realist's view of man and the universe. Surprisingly, this sequence bears a great similarity to patterns of argument in the later Shaw. Some thirteen years afterwards, The Quintessence of Ibsenism moves from disparagement of the Victorian idealization of women into an explanation of the realist's view of existence. Similarly Shaw's pre- face to Three Plays for Puritans (1900) evolves from disparagement of romantic stage conventions about women and love to his view of the diabolonian, Caesarean, and Promethean realist; and the hell scene of Man and Superman switches midway from talk of women and marriage</page><page sequence="10">14 CHARLES A. BERST to the realistic matters of man's deadly instincts versus the evolution of his mind. In all cases, from the Passion Play to Man and Superman, romantic illusion is contrasted with rigorous yet aspiring realism. The fact that Shaw's arguments repeatedly and over such a span of time follow this development from flesh and illusion to matters of reality and spirit points as clearly as anything else to a prevailing religious impetus throughout his life, an impetus starting as far back as his "atheistic" twenty-first year. As might be expected, Judas's criticism of romantic ideas about women and God is less discriminating than similar passages in Shaw's later writings: he attacks women and God themselves almost as much as the romance about them. Also foreshadowing but more strident than the later Shaw is his atheism: Think for thyself, and it must come to this: That the great God will seem a silly idol; The prophets, raving and hysteric madmen, Poets driven wild by their corrupt surroundings; Creation will retire behind a veil, Riddle inexplicable! [Plays, VII, 504] So much for the old tribal idol Jehovah, a bogey Shaw was to denigrate time and again and to dissect most pointedly in his Black Girl in Her Search for God. And regarding Creation this is a precursor of Shaw's exclamation in 1901: "Enough. You expect me to prate about the Abso- lute, about Reality, about The First Cause, and to answer the universal Why. When I see these words in print the book goes into the basket. Good morning" (Self Sketches, p. 55). Judas continues: Then must thou Learn to stand absolutely by thyself, Leaning on nothing, satisfied that thou Can'st nothing know, responsible to nothing, Fearing no power and being within thyself A little independent universe. [p. 504] Such is almost the nature of Shaw's superman, the hero he was later to prefigure when he analyzed Wagner's Siegfried in 1898. Rather like Judas, Siegfried stands against the god Wotan as "a type of the healthy man raised to perfect confidence in his own impulses by an intense and joyous vitality which is above fear, sickliness of conscience, malice, and the makeshifts and moral crutches of law and order which accompany them" (Works, XIX, 225). Jesus responds:</page><page sequence="11">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 15 But this is atheism. JUDAS. 'Tis so. What then? JESUS. Behold the world. Somebody must have made it. JUDAS. Somebody must have made this somebody. JESUS. Some cause must have existed from all time. JUDAS. I may as easily say the world has too. [pp. 504-5] Here is an existentialist taproot, existence preceding essence. In the nature of existence, however, Judas observes life's growth principle which Shaw was later to propose as essence in his Life Force philoso- phy: But friend, thou reasonest like a carpenter. Thou makest coffers; ergo, all visible coffers Must have been made by hands intelligent As thine are. But behold yon sheaves of wheat. They were not planed nor sawn; from a small grain They grew, containing in themselves the principle That thou would'st force on an eternal craftsman. [p. 505] Continuing to shoot out roots for the later G.B.S., Judas states proudly that he does not need paradise - he is "the only man who dares to die"; in the manner of the mature Shaw he thanks nature for his unruly mind wherewith he may know others according to himself and himself according to others, and with which he can envision the evolution of men in humanistic terms. With all of this proto-Shavian assertion it would seem that Judas is his author's champion. But there is another side to the matter. In this dialogue - before its author had read either Hegel or Marx - is a lively dialectic, a poetically charged ambiguity. Similar to so many dialectics in Shaw's later dramas, both sides in the contest are represented by virtuous, well-intentioned beings who have valid points to make. As Judas is assertively independent and unconventional so is Jesus. The one reaches beyond the norm with tough-minded atheism, the other transcends the norm with poetically inspired faith. Since Judas's speeches in Scene II are mostly far longer than those of Jesus he appears to carry the argument, yet the scene tends to build Jesus's special role, a role first glimpsed amidst the family farce of Scene I. There Jesus is the instinctive poet: "I think on Rahab and my mocking spirit/Flies fiercely up, and 'mid the singing stars/Ecstatically dances." But although he desires to be "a son of fire and air" Jesus laments that he is just "the base issue/Of a poor workman's shrew," and he upbraids his mother for driving "All noble aspirations from my</page><page sequence="12">16 CHARLES A. BERST head/And poetry from my heart"(pp. 493, 497). After this the rational- istic Judas comes as a second challenge to Jesus's poetic spirit. But now there is an important difference: while Mary scorns her son's nature, Judas acknowledges its special qualities as opposed to his own: I'll not debate with thee, for I perceive Thou art a poet, and hast made a refuge In rosy bowers of imagination Where thy o'erburdened, questioning soul may rest. Yet would I not exchange the mail of proof, Hard though it be, in which I combat destiny For the soft woven but delusive robe In which thou dost so meekly wrap thyself. [p. 506] Judas's combined sympathy and skepticism here gain extra point in light of a soliloquy he delivers early in the scene. Thinking he is alone in the night, he makes a personal confession: Once - in my youth - I hoped to be a poet, ere my pride In reason's empire made me a philosopher; And still the perfume of my early dreams Smacks in my brain, responsive to the call Of this enchanting scene. Judas! I love thee. Thou art a rare fellow - now in Pilate's hall An earthy libertine, and anon in Nazareth Ethereal and sublime, a wanderer 'midst The radiant stars. And yet a sorry creature Without a crumb of knowledge to replace The anchor, Faith, which thou hast cast away. [p. 499] The philosopher has buried the poet, but not the poet's sensibilities. He is a rare fellow, both an earthy libertine and poet-wanderer amongst the stars. Tugged at by both reason and poetry, he realizes how little knowledge his reason has, and laments that without knowledge, poetry, or Faith he is an anchorless, sorry creature. He immediately seeks to regain his cynical composure: "Pah! - A beastly world! - better believe in nothing/Than old wives' tales and murder-stained Jehovahs." But obviously he is discomposed. He even rejects logic in favor of the vital- ity of his own youth: "Avaunt, ye trains of logic. Up, Iscariot!/Be irre- sponsible, sublime, and young." What he has actually done is to substi- tute one poetry for another: the poetry of Being for the poetry of Faith. So it was, one can guess, with the young Shaw, the striking thing being that apparently he knew it.</page><page sequence="13">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 17 In perceiving himself as a sorry creature without Faith Judas reveals a private Jesus-like sensitivity. His skepticism and sense of loss fore- shadow Jesus's later response to his cynicism about a First Cause. Jesus replies to his atheism: For, till this day, I never met a man Who believed less than I. I do confess The God of Scripture is a gloomy tyrant On whom I cannot bring myself to look. But, were I to believe no God at all I would, despairing, die; I could not face A stony blank of vegetable life Preying upon itself. [p. 506] This exchange between atheist and believer undoubtedly derives from an incident Shaw recalls in his preface to Back to Methuselah. Not long before writing his Passion Play he had an argument with a priest, Father Addis, in the Brompton Oratory. To Father Addis's commitment to God as a First Cause, Shaw responded, "By your leave ... it is as easy for me to believe that the universe made itself as that a maker of the universe made himself: in fact much easier; for the universe visibly exists and makes itself as it goes along, whereas a maker for it is a hypothesis." Father Addis's concluding reflection was "that he should go mad if he lost his belief." Shaw, on the other hand, "glorying in the robust callousness of youth and the comedie spirit, felt quite comfort- able and said so; though I was touched, too, by his evident sincerity" (Plays, V, 287). In reporting his youthful callousness, Shaw then goes on to undercut it. He comments on the argument as an example of a historical and spiritual problem: society had divided itself between belief in a Jehovah- bogey on the one hand and atheistic scorn on the other, with true spirit- ual awareness dropping through the gap: "One hardly knows which is the more appalling: the abjectness of the credulity or the flippancy of the scepticism. The result was inevitable. All who were strongminded enough not to be terrified by the bogey were left stranded in empty contemptuous negation ... It was easy to throw the bogey into the dust- bin; but none the less the world, our corner of the universe, did not look like a pure accident: it presented evidences of design in every direction. There was mind and purpose behind it" (pp. 287-88). Brought together, these strains from the Shaw of 1878 and 1921 reveal striking parallels. Although he was callous, the young man who argued with Father Addis was "touched" by the priest's evident sincer- ity. By the time he wrote the play this emotion came forth more</page><page sequence="14">18 CHARLES A. BERST strongly in his Judas who appreciates the poetry and imagination of the believer. Further, not only has Judas himself once hoped to be a poet, but he exemplifies an argument of the mature Shaw when he privately admits that without Faith he is anchorless. Jesus reflects Shaw in his limited belief and his recognition that "The God of Scripture is a gloomy tyrant." Finally, in his very need to believe, Jesus anticipates the older Shaw; like Shaw, he is repulsed by the mindlessness of such ideas as natural selection: "I could not face/ A stony blank of vegetable life/ Preying upon itself." To outface this stony blank Shaw was to hypothe- size a Life Force much as his Jesus hypothesizes "A grand, ineffable, benevolent Power" (p. 506). At the conclusion of the Judas-Jesus dialogue the rational and poetic views literally come together when Judas says, Thus 1 to reason trust, and thou to dreams. But, save that I ask no part for myself Except the foretaste which my mind supplies We look to the same end. Then let's take hands. With the joining of hands Shaw effects a Hegelian synthesis long be- fore he had read Hegel: Henceforth, thy gentle faith Shall travel hand in hand with hard negation, Tempering its unsympathetic edge And learning somewhat from its breadth of vision. Trust me not, though, too quickly. Man is fickle, And all that I have said under these stars Tomorrow I may laugh at. But fear nothing: I will not laugh at thee. [pp. 508-9] The question may be, who will learn the most from whom? Shaw's fragment left him far short of a rendering of Judas's betrayal of Jesus, although he hints at it in the "Trust me not." Significantly, Judas's words suggest that reason is untrustworthy: tomorrow's laughter at to- day's ideas may chastize and purify them, but "reason" may be laugh- able and subject to the fickleness of man - perhaps, then, not reason- able at all, quite possibly a secondary faculty, not a prime mover. If this be the case, how is reason to be relied upon? It would seem that Shaw is edging instinctively towards Schopenhauer's concept of will over rea- son; more immediately this statement is juxtaposed with the poetry of Jesus which, although it may have much to learn, is not fickle. Of the two men, even in this version of the story, the poetry and faith of Jesus, not the rationalism and skepticism of Judas, seem more likely to change the world.</page><page sequence="15">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 19 Critics have been quick to observe the autobiographical analogy in the play's story line - a romantic young man (illegitimate?) discontent with provincialism, unhappy with the shabbiness and conventional hy- pocrisies of his family, a potential prophet unhonored in his own home and country, leaves behind a drunken father to pursue his destiny in a big city where he can "begin to live and work." However subconscious the analogy may be, its audacity is obvious: it aligns Shaw more with Jesus than with Judas. Actually Shaw is both outside and inside Jesus. In giving Judas the longer speeches and more lively character, the young atheist is project- ing the Mephistophelean role of his childhood into his first sustained work of art: Judas is the flexing of his iconoclastic spirit. But at the same time Jesus is obviously an intriguing figure to him: while the young diabolonian playwright ruthlessly brings the Messiah to earth by making him a bastard and Mary a shrew, and by drawing him as simple and romantic, yet even the diabolonian finds that Jesus embodies an attractive genius and poetry. Also there was the appealing pattern of Jesus's rise from frustration and obscurity to fulfilment and fame, a pattern no doubt striking sympathetic chords in the young playwright's spirit. Consequently his Jesus embodies his own aspiring spirit, his own poetic romanticism, while his Judas is Shaw the incipient critic, appre- ciating his own poetic impulses yet chastizing their romance. Thus Shaw's internal spiritual condition found expression in an ex- ternal drama - the one serving as a metaphor for the other. And this was to be a large component of his creative writing throughout his life. Finally, by partaking of a personal spiritual metaphor the play's driving force is a spiritual quest of its author as well as of its characters, and its autobiographical analogy forwards its author in the most ambitious archetypal terms. Privately and instinctively as well as artistically and rationally Shaw was testing the sandals of a superman. One might suppose that Shaw's immersion in Shelley at the end of his teens predisposed him to the atheistic attitude of Judas, but proba- bly the reverse was true. The atheism of Shelley's "Essay on Christian- ity" is in fact sensitively spiritual. He writes: "The universal Being can only be described or defined by negatives which deny his subjection to the laws of all inferior existences. Where indefiniteness ends idolatry and anthropomorphism begins."1 J Such a view, in itself, is atheism only to men of cramped imagination. In fact it is akin to the view commonly held by the greatest Christian mystics, who sometimes tried to express their experiences of divinity as light or fire, but often found language inadequate, and consequently would describe divinity in terms of what it was not.20 Yet like the later Shaw, Shelley does try to attribute a quality to God's</page><page sequence="16">20 CHARLES A. BERST indefiniteness. His motive is much the same as Shaw's: the mind aspires to conception, no matter how limited man's capacities are. Beset by such a drive, Shelley offers a precursor to Shaw's Life Force: "There is a Power by which we are surrounded, like the atmosphere in which some motionless lyre is suspended, which visits with its breath our silent chords at will. . . . This Power is God; and those who have seen God have, in the period of their purer and more perfect nature, been har- monized by their own will to so exquisite [a] consentaneity of power as to give forth divinest melody, when the breath of universal being sweeps over their frame."21 When Shaw's Jesus speaks of "A grand, ineffable, benevolent Power" he is close to this, but then he slips into anthropo- morphism by imagining the Power "throned in the clouds" (p. 506). More directly relevant to Shaw's Passion Play, Shelley identifies Jesus as a poet and at the same time gives poetry the highest spiritual status. He calls Jesus an "extraordinary genius," a "wonderful man," a "subli- mest and most holy poet" who possessed a "daring mind": "such an expression as he has used was prompted by the energy of genius, and was the overflowing enthusiasm of a poet."22 And in Shelley's lexicon "Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once the centre and circum- ference of knowledge." By contrast, "Reason is to imagination as the instrument to the agent, as the body to the spirit, as the shadow to the substance."23 Shelley incorporates this aesthetic-spiritual vision in his Prometheus Unbound, in which the major themes of forgiveness and selfless love dramatize the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount. The play draws numerous analogies between the sufferings of Prometheus and the Passion of Christ. Prometheus is freed not by Hercules but by his ceasing to hate and starting to pity Jupiter. "God" is never ex- plained in the play: he is not Jupiter; his force is a vague power of necessity and process called Demogorgon; man must redeem himself through aspiration and love. It was in these spiritual terms, terms related to socialistic thought and vegetarianism, that Shaw experienced Shelley as "a religious force" (Plays, II, 499), one which no doubt influenced the writing of his Pas- sion Play. And complementing these terms were others from his youth. In his late eighties he remarked, "That I can write as I do without having to think about my style is due to my having been as a child steeped in the Bible, the Pilgrim's Progress, and Cassell's Illustrated Shakespear."24 The subject matter and idiom were in his consciousness. They came together in a private expression (obviously unpublishable and too sacrilegious for the Victorian stage) which suited his private needs. The fitful flames of his youthful diabolism were joining with a Promethean fire which involved as much spirit as revolt. Shaw may have abandoned his manuscript for any number of rea-</page><page sequence="17">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 21 sons. Most suggestive is his inscription "Vile Stuff" across one deleted passage. But how "vile stuff"? Possibly because the blank verse is fre- quently stilted, the poetic diction and images often forced, the charac- terizations more lively than deep. By comparison with Shakespeare his efforts were bumbling. For that matter, perhaps the idiom of Shakes- peare was not worth emulating. He commented later: "Elizabethan Renascence fustian is no more bearable after medieval poesy than Scribe after Ibsen" (Plays, II, 519). In his play there is certain poesy in the like of the medieval mystery plays which combine farce with Bibli- cal subject matter. A subtler form of this serio-comic idiom was later to become his hallmark. But here he had committed himself to blank verse and the shackles of a Biblical tradition which ran counter to his creative and spiritual energies. As he recognized later in writing his Jesus-Pilate dialogue for his preface to On the Rocks, his version had to fly free of its source. After having written the Jesus-Judas dialogue, his big stone had been thrown: beyond this his imagination could only play an irreverent hopscotch with numerous Biblical details, and finally it was up against a far greater poetry - that of the Christ legend itself. For whatever reason, this particular effort was dropped. But for all its brevity and imperfections it does reveal Shaw thrusting himself forth at the very start of his creative career in a way which, for all its skepticism, is assertively spiritual. In his ambiguous struggle with these materials he was an example of his own words: "The truth is that dramatic invention is the first effort of man to become intellectually conscious" (Plays, I, 378). Shaw's five novels, ground forth methodically at the rate of one a year between 1879 and 1883, were his first major attempt to move from the private world of his imagination into the public arena. Their motive, method, and limited artistic and commercial success have re- sulted in their being largely passed over by critics and biographers.23 Although they display glimmerings of talent, they are pedestrian in comparison with the outpourings of Shaw's later genius. But overarch- ing their mundanity is their importance as a factor in his spiritual growth. In toto they comprise an aesthetics of being, a type of personal poetry. Shaw expresses it simply: "to preserve myself from the dry rot of idleness [I] attempted to realize myself in works of Art."26 But most ambitiously he links this self-realization with divinity: "How much should a competent novelist know? Well, everything. . . . This, how- ever, requires the novelist to be God Omniscient, if not God Almighty. It is a counsel of perfection; but it is not therefore useless. A counsel of perfection is the great desideratum in all branches of conduct - to be striven towards if never attained. The novelist must do his best."27 Although the subject matter of the novels is mostly far from reli-</page><page sequence="18">22 CHARLES A. BERST gious, they do give evidence, in a seminal way, of a spiritual quest. Having viewed the poetry of one superman in his Passion Play, Shaw gives vent to others in his fiction. Metaphorically, four of the five novels stretch human limits. While their protagonists are of this world they are also heroic in very special ways, and, as each is quite different, they reveal their author exploring various godlike possibilities of man. Shaw started on a personally frank ground floor. He comments that his first novel, "was called, with mercilous fitness, Immaturity" (Works, IV, xi). Robert Smith, the hero of Immaturity, is at the same time the most autobiographical and the least admirable of all the heroes. Retir- ing, lonely, introverted, and ineffectual, yet sententious and snobbish, one of his few redeeming characteristics is that he, like Shaw, has thrown over Byron for Shelley. And one of the few redeeming qualities of the novel is that the author can mock his own fictional alter ego. This was not a bad starting point. At least it was close to home, and self-criticism must be active at the start of spiritual growth. Beyond Smith and even beyond himself Shaw reached for more impressive alternatives. Instinctively, almost poetically, he was striving to fulfill his conviction that "The business of a novelist is largely to provide working models of improved types of humanity."28 The first of these improved types was a nineteenth-century extension of his Judas: Edward Conolly of The Irrational Knot. In Conolly, an extraordinarily rational and practical electrical engineer, Shaw pushed his own rationalism to the limit. Being both a dedicated scientist and an accomplished musician, Conolly embodies materialistic mind, inventive- ness, commercial usefulness, social grace, and cultural savoir-faire: he is, in short, a specifically modern god. Being almost too much so, he was a purge for his author. In 1892 Shaw remarked: "I hardly know anybody who has got through 'The Irrational Knot.' ... I suspect that the model Conolly was as incompatible with the public as with his wife. Long before I got to the writing of the last chapter I could hardly stand him myself."29 Later he wrote to Sister Laurentia McLachlan: "I ex- hausted rationalism when I got to the end of my second novel at the age of twenty-four, and should have come to a dead stop if I had not proceeded to purely mystical assumptions."30 So much for Conolly and the strictly rational side of Judas. Nowhere in Shaw's life is a spiritual shift clearer than in the three years from 1881 to 1883. Shaw himself pinpoints September 5, 1882, when his eyes were opened to socialism by a lecture of Henry George, author of Progress and Poverty. As a result he delved into Marx's Capital, remarking afterwards, "I was a coward until Marx made a Communist of me and gave me a faith" (Self Sketches, p. 109). However this faith had a groundwork. Not only had Shelley moved his spirit, but through his</page><page sequence="19">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 23 third and fourth novels his imagination had broken free of rationalism into an expanding celebration ofthat which was instinctively heroic. The protagonists of his three novels during this period are Blakean and Promethean. They assert the virtue of the diabolical or pagan culture hero. And each is identified as a type of god. Shaw's comments on the hero of his third novel, the composer Owen Jack in Love Among the Artists, indicate this expansive change in his aes- thetic and spiritual values: "Jack is just the opposite of Conolly: the man of genius as opposed to the rational man. The novel marks a volte face on my part. I had before kept within intellectual bounds: here I let myself go and guessed my way by instinct"; and, later, he describes Jack as "a British Beethoven, utterly unreasonable and unaccountable, and even outrageous, but a vital genius, powerful in an art that is beyond logic and even beyond words."31 Jack is ugly, pock-marked, and demonic, but at the same time his spirit is an aspiring one, almost other-worldly. At one climactic point he rejects money and marriage, exclaiming, "Back to thy holy garret, oh my soul!" (Works, III, 213). Edward Conolly, reappearing from the preceding novel, observes: "He would make an excellent God, but a most unpleasant man, and an unbearable husband" (p. 246). With the performance of Jack's magnum opus, Prometheus Unbound, Shaw coalesces Beethoven, Shelley, a devil-god, and Prometheus all in a model of aesthetic and spiritual energy. The hero of Shaw's fourth novel, Cashel Byrons Profession, is a sharp contrast to Jack in appearance and talent, but as a champion prize- fighter he is fully as instinctive and also much like a god: this time a Greek one, a statement of pagan divinity in flesh, an Apollo. When the novel's heroine first encounters him exercising in a forest opening she is dazzled - he is like a beautiful statue: "His broad pectoral muscles, in their white covering, were like slabs of marble. Even his hair, short, crisp, and curly, seemed like burnished bronze in the evening light. It came into Lydia's mind that she had disturbed an antique god in his sylvan haunt" (Works, IV, 37). The gospel of this god is "executive power" and, reflecting Shaw's pugilistic spirit and current interest in boxing, he looks upon life as a fight in which one must have courage, sharp instincts, training, and knowledge. In contrast, Lydia is a reincar- nation of the Shavian rationalist, and in comparison with Byron she is a fragile creation: delicate, high-strung, artificial; finally, according to Shaw, she is "machine-made . . . full of wheels and springs."32 In Lydia pure rationalism appears slightly pathetic, a bit absurd: she decides to marry this sylvan god on eugenic principles, but the principles go awry when their girls take after Byron and their boys after her. The ebullience of Shaw's fifth hero, Sidney Trefusis of An Unsocial Socialist, reflects that of his author, in whom Marx had just excited a</page><page sequence="20">24 CHARLES A. BERST religious response. ("From that hour I was a speaker with a gospel" [Self Sketches, p. 58]). Trefusis is loquacious, egocentric, outrageous - and intent on converting the world to his socialist cause. In him Shaw's spiritual impulses burst through a social spout. This hero is a bizarre, would-be Messiah: "With my egotism, my charlatanry, my tongue, and my habit of having my own way, I am fit for no calling but that of saviour of mankind - just of the sort they like" (Works, V, 1 10). Thus in his last novel Shaw ironically contemporizes the poetry of Jesus. Shaw said that he intended An Unsocial Socialist to be "a gigantic grapple with the whole social problem," but that he left it incomplete because "I broke down in sheer ignorance and incapacity."33 There was another obvious reason: since his novels were all rejected by publishers, he must have felt compelled, as a type of Trefusis, to move from unsuccessful fiction to the realities of social activism. But while he had embraced an inspiring gospel through Marx, in retrospect it seems probable that the confident extrovert of the late 1880s was first born in a more poetic element. At least in part he had grown in perception through fictional alter egos, metaphoric extensions of his own im- pulses - heroic embodiments of rationalism, art, pugilism, and social- ism. And insofar as he conceived of these as godlike he was building in himself, via art, a sense of immanent divinity. This highly personal sense, generated so imaginatively here and over such a period of time, was to well forth in his later Life Force convictions. Take, for example, an argument he launches against Darwinism and materialism in 1919: "Such a thing cannot last; it is too entirely against all our poetic in- stincts. . . . We know there is intention and purpose in the universe, because there is intention and purpose in us. People have said, 'Where is this purpose, this intention?' I say, 'It is here; it is in me; I feel it. I directly experience it, and so do you, and you need not try and look as if you didn't' " (Religious Speeches, p. 76). In 1889 Shaw called his novels "bad sermons, which failed because I, thanks to skulking in picture galleries, was a nonentity; and the realiza- tion of a nonentity in a novel is not interesting."34 But the linking of sermons, self-realization, and alter egos with godlike attributes suggests strongly that here was a major origin of the later voice which stated, "I strive to surpass myself and produce Superman."30 The years of Shaw's socialist activity following his conversion by Marx have been viewed by biographers as largely secular, yet in fact they were filled with artfulness (if not art) and a religious quality. Often quoted is the statement with which he shocked members of the Shelley Society in January 1887: "Like Shelley, I am a Socialist, an Atheist, and a Vegetarian." And almost equally telling is his response to a paper on "Saul" at a Browning Society meeting the next May. The Society's min-</page><page sequence="21">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 25 utes report: "Although not a Christian, [Shaw said] he would like to say a word or two on Christ from a purely secular point of view. In regard to the statement that Christ is always with us, he thought that if Christ were to come on earth and see what was taking place, he would be very greatly hurt to be told that it was the influence of his spirit, for [Shaw] thought this was the most desperately mean, sordid, selfish, rascally, dastardly century that any one could wish to live in."36 What can so easily be missed about such statements is their religious nature and their literary setting. At this time Shaw was a faithful mem- ber of the Shakespeare, Shelley, and Browning Societies. Like the most diligent of preachers he lectured on his socialist gospel virtually every Sunday, and sometimes two or three times a Sunday, from 1883 to 1895. In 1889 he admitted to the Church and Stage Guild: "I have an incorrigible propensity for preaching."37 On the one hand his state- ment to the Browning Society is rhetorically Trefusis-like, on the other hand it identifies with Christ and anticipates Shaw's "Preface on the Prospects of Christianity," which outweighs Androcles and the Lion. No one seems to have noticed that by the end of the 1880s he was identify- ing ever more with Christ - tentatively, rhetorically, playfully, but not insignificantly for a man to whom every jest was an earnest in the womb of time. During the 1880s Shaw sprouted with pseudonyms in his essays and letters to the press (possibly these were an ancillary means for him to move art into life) and one of his most audacious in 1888 was "J. C," on the subject, "Is Christianity a Failure?": "As to the eighteen centu- ries of what you call Christianity, I have nothing to do with it. It was invented by an aristocrat of the Roman set [St. Paul], a university man whose epistles are the silliest middle class stuff on record. When I see my name mixed up with it in your excellent paper, I feel as if nails were going into me - and I know what that sensation is like better than you do"(Letters, I, 197). This is even closer to the Androcles preface than his comment to the Browning Society. And the public jest seems to have become a private earnest in his personal correspondence: "My only boast is that in these days when it is so easy &amp; cheap to be a Christ, I have ventured to follow the poor, despised, but always right Devil" (26 September 1890); "What can I say except Saul, Saul, why persecu- test thou me?" (12 December 1890); "I have also protested against the practice of making saints of people who, like myself, abstain from the ordinary pleasures of society because they have no taste for them. Formerly it may have been difficult to live in a modernized Jesus Christ style; but now it is easy, convenient and cheap; and if a man makes a merit of it he is pretty sure to be a humbug" (18 December 1890; Letters, I, 266, 274, 280).</page><page sequence="22">26 CHARLES A. BERST In all of these cases Shaw is toying with a kinship, sizing it up, testing it, manipulating the analogy dramatically or rhetorically. On April 26, 1891, he had occasion to surprise the National Secular Soci- ety which was considering him for its presidency. He felt that there was as high a percentage of fundamentalists among the Secularists as in the Salvation Army, and these he jolted: "My demonstration that the Trinity is not an arithmetical impossibility, but the commonplace union of father, son, and spirit in one person; that the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is an instalment of the sacred truth that all conceptions are immaculate; that the Roman Catholic worship of the Madonna is in effect a needed addition of The Mother to The Father in The Godhead; and that any clever Jesuit could convert an average Secularist to Roman Catholicism, froze the marrow in their bones" (Self Sketches, p. 74). Shaw's recognition at this point of the need for the addition of the Mother to the Father in the Godhead is even more notable than his perception of the Trinity. This is a step toward Lilith and the Life Force, one apparently suggested to him by a poet who shared his "pe- culiar sense of the world." Much later he recalled that "Goethe rescued us from [the horror of atheistic despair] with his 'Eternal Feminine that draws us forward and upward' which was the first modern manifesto of the mysterious force in creative evolution. That is what made Faust a world classic" (Plays, V, 703). In toto the set of assertions with which Shaw shocked the Secularists is striking for its imaginative engagement of religious metaphors and its deft linking of metaphor to life. Its religious sense is informed with an artist's perception, a perception supporting Shaw's view that supe- rior spiritual conviction is largely a matter of superior mind and aes- thetics. In such a light, almost exactly at this time, he viewed his role as a music critic: "I should be a very poor critic indeed if I did not take my function to be as religious a one as man can discharge, and one which, if it is not fit to be exercised in a church, is not fit to be exer- cised anywhere" (Works, XXVI, 137). Perhaps during these months Shaw was especially sensitive to reli- gious metaphors and his religious function as a critic because he was writing The Quintessence of Ibsenism. Recent scholars have subjected the social and philosophical aspects of the Quintessence to much fine analy- sis. The philosophical influence of Schopenhauer, Hegel, and Butler has been examined closely, as have Shaw's particular social values.38 But these critical views, valuable as they are, should probably be enlarged to include Shaw's sensitivity to Ibsen's poetic qualities, particularly since a common complaint of early critics was that Shaw neglected Ibsen the poet for Ibsen the social pioneer. Although he was well aware of Ibsen</page><page sequence="23">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 27 from the mid 1880s, Shaw admits that when he played the part of Krogstad in a private reading of A Doll's House, he was not strongly impressed by Ibsen or the play: "its novelty as a morally original study of marriage did not stagger me as it staggered Europe." What, then, stimulated his interest? He explains succinctly: "Indeed I concerned myself very little about Ibsen until, later on, William Archer translated Peer Gynt to me viva voce, when the magic of the great poet opened my eyes in a flash to the importance of the social philosopher" (Works, II, xxi-xxii). "The magic of the great poet opened my eyes in a flash" - in psycho- logical studies of the creative process an equivalent of this type of sudden awareness has been called the "eureka phenomenon"; in studies of mysticism it is called "illumination": both involve a flash of insight occurring often in an off moment to one who has long aspired toward a high goal. Whatever the process, Shaw's comment is striking: Ibsen the poet led him to Ibsen the social philosopher. Elsewhere he says that attention is the key factor in learning anything: the Norwegian first captured his attention via poetry. Under these circumstances it seems by no means incidental that Shelley is the first person mentioned in the Quintessence and that he is a major point of reference in the early part of the essay. Shaw introduces him as a rare example of those who are pioneers in the march to the plains of heaven - a two-sided hero, hated like the devil for exposing mankind's hidden evils, adored like a savior for rejecting tyrannous traditions. The purpose of his essay, says Shaw, "is to distil the quintessence of Ibsen's message to his age" (Works, XIX, 46), and in order to convey this quintessence Shaw sets forth his famous metaphor of society: imag- ining a community of a thousand persons, he proposes that 700 will be thoughtless, sheeplike Philistines; 299 will be self-ashamed, institution- exalting idealists; and only one will be a self-respecting, truth-facing realist. The idealists are the particular bane of society since they pro- mote its social illusions; the very rare quality of realists is that they strip away the illusions. Among these latter few apostles of truth Shaw em- phasizes two: "you and I, reader, will be at cross purposes at every sentence unless you allow me to distinguish pioneers like Shelley and Ibsen as realists from the idealists of my imaginary community of one thousand" (p. 32). Shaw's application of this social metaphor to Ibsen's plays raises a basic issue: Is he imposing his own metaphor on Ibsen, or is he deriv- ing it? Shaw claimed that he was deriving it - that he was conceptualiz- ing what Ibsen presents instinctively and dramatically. In a letter dated 16 December 1890 he observes:</page><page sequence="24">28 CHARLES A. BERST Now what Ibsen had done is to call attention to the fact that the moment we begin to worship [the ten] commandments and [social] ideals for their own sakes, we actually place them in opposition to the very purpose they were instituted to serve, i.e. human happiness. His plays are simply dramatic illustrations of the terrible mischief and mis- ery made every day, not by scoundrels, but by moral people and ideal- ists in their inexorable devotion to what they call their 'duty.' The merit of my Ibsen paper lies in its discovery of this clue to Ibsen's meaning. [Letters, I, 277-78] In short, by dramatic illustrations Ibsen has called attention to religious and social realities. In a kindred manner as critic, Shaw creates his metaphor of a society of one thousand in order to direct attention to what he perceives as Ibsen's meaning: he uses a type of analytical poetry to highlight and build upon the dramatic poetry of his subject. The foregoing helps provide a groundwork for Shaw's more adven- turesome leap into Ibsen's metaphysics. Second only to the social meta- phor in the Quintessence is a spiritual one, and through this Shaw seems to have clarified his spiritual thought. He starts his analysis of the plays with Ibsen's poetic dramas, Brand and Peer Gynt. He appreciates Brand's concept of a young God, having himself followed Goethe's lead in proposing the feminine in the godhead: conventional, sentimental images of the divine must be shattered. But Brand sacrifices himself and others to his saintly idealism. Peer Gynt, in contrast, is a selfish rascal but equally idealistic: with indomitable will he seeks to be Em- peror of Himself, a hopeless illusion, "for the world-will is outside Peer Gynt as well as inside him" (p. 49). From the willful poetry of Brand and Peer Gynt, Shaw moves to Em- peror and Galilean. Like Shaw's Back to Methuselah, Emperor and Galilean is a philosophical and religious monster which its author appraised more highly than anyone else; and, as though anticipating such a parallel, Shaw comes spiritually closest to Ibsen at this point. He comments that here, as in Wagner's case, "we find Ibsen, after composing his two great dramatic poems, entering on a struggle to become intellectually con- scious of what he had done" (p. 54). This nearly expresses Shaw's case as well: Archer's reading aloud of Peer Gynt had opened his eyes, and in this chapter he, too, strives to become intellectually conscious of what has been done. Apparently for both men inspired art provided the brightest flame for the analytical consciousness which came afterwards. Near the start of the chapter on Emperor and Galilean, Shaw spends several pages on Samuel Butler, Darwin, and evolution, emphasizing Butler's discovery that Darwin's theory of natural selection had ban- ished mind from the universe; thus while Darwin's theory freed man from the tyranny of the old Biblical God, it also plunged him into the</page><page sequence="25">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 29 despair of materialism. But Shaw subordinates this important observa- tion (one he had already anticipated in his Passion Play) to a form of spiritual answer in Emperor and Galilean. He comments that "[Ibsen's] prophetic belief in the spontaneous growth of the will made him a meliorist without reference to the operation of Natural Selection" (p. 57). Beyond this Shaw's primary interest lies in the central metaphor of Ibsen's play wherein Maximus the Mystic attempts to show the Em- peror Julian the ultimate nature of spirit. In Shaw's words: "He who can see that not on Olympus, not nailed to the cross, but in himself is God: he is the man to build Brand's bridge between the flesh and the spirit . . . Maximus's idea is a synthesis of relations in which not only is Christ God in exactly the same sense as that in which Julian is God, but Julian is Christ as well." In the end Julian fails because "He had felt the godhead in himself, but not in others. Being only able to say, with half conviction, 'The kingdom of heaven is within me,' he had been utterly vanquished by the Galilean who had been able to say, 'The kingdom of heaven is within you.' But he was on the way to that full truth. A man cannot believe in others until he believes in himself; for his conviction of the equal worth of his fellows must be filled by the overflow of his conviction of his own worth" (pp. 59-63). These passages represent a marked advance in Shaw's articulation of his perceptions about man's relation to spirit and divinity: what for- merly was largely instinctive or abstract is now conceptualized. One can trace strains of Shaw's indebtedness - as he does - to Samuel Butler's evolutionary theories, Schopenhauer's concept of will as a greater power than reason, and Hegel's thesis/antithesis/synthesis. Shaw read them all in 1887, and all apply here in varying degrees. But not until 1890 did he bring his ideas into a concentrated focus and statement, and apparently it took Ibsen's dramatic poetry to bring this about. On July 18, 1890, he delivered a paper on Ibsen, which he expanded and published as the Quintessence in October 1891. In this period of time it would seem that Ibsen's art not only coalesced his views but gave per- sonal continuity and energy to his metaphysics. Maximus's insight as interpreted by Shaw is essentially Shelleyan and Promethean. It is fore- shadowed in Judas and Jesus joining hands in the Passion Play. Its assertion of the godlike man is anticipated in varying ways in Shaw's last three novels. In its acknowledgement of divinity in all men it had been the spiritual premise of Shaw the socialist-preacher for many years. But all of these strands - artistic, philosophical, and social - had not come together until Ibsen the poet opened his eyes. Via Ibsen, the Christ figure whom he had viewed ambiguously in the Passion Play and mimicked in An Unsocial Socialist suddenly became a spiritual counter- part. His view of the implicit metaphor in Christ, of the Word made</page><page sequence="26">30 CHARLES A. BERST flesh, both deepened and broadened. Hence, perhaps, the flurry of Christ references in his letters at the time, and his increasing tendency, as the years went on, to draw a personal comparison. His summary perception of the spiritual powers in Ibsen's art is best stated in his preface to the 1913 edition of the Quintessence: "It is not too much to say that the works of Ibsen furnish one of the best modern keys to the prophecies of Scripture" (Works, XIX, 6-7). This, at least, had been true for Shaw. In his essays, letters, and plays over the next seven years Shaw re- peatedly linked poets and art with spirit. From the public platform and in print he espoused Shelley the "sinner," remarking that "I had noth- ing to do but give a faithful account of Shelley's real opinions, with every one of which I unreservedly agree" (Works, XXIX, 257). Like a priest he urged Janet Achurch to give up drugs and alcohol by turning to the art of religion and the religion of art: "You then get two sorts of people: irreligious people, whom no amount of culture can make otherwise than worthless, and artists, who find in their art an irresist- ible motive. . . . there is always religion if you can reach it - the religion of Beethoven's ninth symphony, the religion which rediscovers God in man and the Virgin Mother in every carpenter's wife" (Letters, I, 504- 5). In this vein it is the Shelley-like Marchbanks in Candida who sees the Virgin in a parson's wife and who, in a clear reference to Ibsen's recent play, has the potential of "a master builder." And the possibility that an apparent devil (like Shelley or Shaw?) may be deeply religious is a poetically inspired paradox of The Devil's Disciple: "A century ago Wil- liam Blake was, like Dick Dudgeon, an avowed Diabolonian: he called his angels devils and his devils angels. His devil is a Redeemer. Let those who have praised my originality in conceiving Dick Dudgeon's strange religion read Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and I shall be fortunate if they do not rail at me for a plagiarist" (Plays, II, 34). Perhaps more than anyone else, poets with such visions were driving towards Life Force ends. Shaw's longest and most important essay in the mid- 1890s is "A Degenerate's View of Nordau," which he revised for booklet publica- tion in 1908 as The Sanity of Art. The essay is a response to Max Nor- dau's huge tome Degeneration, whose English translation in 1895 had caused a considerable stir. Here Shaw specifically takes up the banner of the spiritual powers of art. Against Nordau's claim that modern art and artists are decadent, he asserts the exact opposite: by defying and breaking up old forms and by asserting new energies and a new sense of realities, art advances civilization. It is through art that philosophy is rendered accessible: "[Schopenhauer's] turn for popularity did not come until after Darwin's, and then mostly through the influence of</page><page sequence="27">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 31 two great artists, Richard Wagner and Ibsen." Most importantly, great art is essentially, deeply spiritual: "The great artist is he who goes a step beyond the demand, and, by supplying works of a higher beauty and a higher interest than have yet been perceived, succeeds, after a brief struggle with its strangeness, in adding this fresh extension of sense to the heritage of the race. This is why we value art; this is why we feel that the iconoclast and the Puritan are attacking something made ho- lier, by solid usefulness, than their own theories of purity; this is why art has won the privileges of religion."59 In his essay "On Going to Church" (1896) Shaw gives one of the purest of spiritual rationales for the building of great cathedrals. As opposed to the more vulgar assumption that cathedrals are tributes to the grandeur of God and should awe one accordingly, his approach is highly private and Protestant as well as aesthetic and spiritual. Through architecture he seeks to bring out the transcendent spirit from within himself: "In my consciousness there is a market, a garden, a dwelling, a workshop, a lover's walk - above all, a cathedral. My appeal to the master-builder is: Mirror this cathedral for me in living stone; make it with hands; let it direct its sure and clear appeal to my senses, so that when my spirit is vaguely groping after an elusive mood my eye shall be caught by the skyward tower, showing me where, within the cathedral, I may find my way to the cathedral within me."40 Inspired by the cathedral within himself, Shaw wrote in August 1895: "I want to write a big book of devotion for modern people, bringing all the truths latent in the old religious dogmas into contact with real life - a gospel of Shawianity, in fact" {Letters, I, 551). Very possibly this desire bore fruit in 1898 when he completed The Perfect Wagnerite, where once again his religious and social ideas take shape in a response to art. At any rate in preparing for the essay's publication he advised his publisher that "it should be got up as a book of devotion for pocket use" (Letters, II, 58). Although the Wagnerite (especially for pocket use) is hardly a big book, it did, in effect, cap a trilogy which approximates Shaw's ambi- tion. When the Quintessence, The Sanity of Art, and the Wagnerite were gathered into one volume of his Works in 1930 no one seemed to notice the coherence of the combination. The volume's prosaic title, Major Critical Essays, gives little indication that all three essays are strongly related. But in many ways these may be seen as Shaw's big book of devotion, his gospel - or at least proto-gospel insofar as the essays were a spiritual loam for his religious plays, lectures, and essays of the next fifty years. An overview of the three reveals their common denomina- tor: all three are greatly concerned with matters of society and spirit, and all three spring primarily from a base of art. Further, from a</page><page sequence="28">32 CHARLES A. BERST gospel viewpoint, there is an apposite, complementary shift of focus from one to the other: the religious highlight in the first deals with the Galilean, the Son; the emphasis in the second is on the spiritual func- tion of art, art as Holy Spirit; and the figure of greatest concern and interest in the last is Wotan, the god. In sum, the Essays comprise a Shavian type of Trinitarian gospel, a gospel alive with sermons, spirit- ual metaphors, and dramatic parables, all aimed at edifying - if not converting - mankind socially and spiritually. Until recently critics have objected, much as they did to the Quintes- sence, that Shaw's allegorical interpretation of Wagner's Ring cycle in The Perfect Wagnerite violates the original with his socialistic views. These critics are at least half wrong on each of two counts: first, both Ibsen and Wagner had strong social views not far from Shaw's (the critics have not done their homework); second, Shaw's interpretations, especially in the Wagnerite, are nearly as metaphysical as they are social, and his meta- physics work closely with premises in his sources. More recent critics have seen in the Wagnerite a development of Shaw's earlier distinction between Philistines, idealists, and realists: he characterizes Wagner's dwarfs and giants as Philistines, the god Wotan as an idealist, the hero Siegfried as a realist. Evolution demands that the idealist god be over- thrown by the realist hero. But at this point there is a new wrinkle: like Wagner, Shaw is relatively sympathetic to Wotan: he perceives that Wo- tan must in all responsibility uphold laws because laws give necessary order to existence; yet at the same time laws commonly exist beyond their useful function - they become ossified, sacrosanct impediments to the evolutionary flow of life. Wotan is additionally sympathetic because he also perceives the problem, and consequently, for the sake of the evolutionary process, he half wills his own overthrow by Siegfried. His idealism is not just illusory and inhibiting - it has an enlightened view of evolutionary necessities.41 What makes the Wagnerite especially interesting regarding the genesis of Shaw's God is that in and around this allegory Shaw engages not one or two but four manifestations of the godly, and in these four his sym- pathies combine with his conceptions to forge his mature perception. The primary god of the Wagnerite is the Life Force, not yet so named, but clearly defined in the first chapter: Such a force there is, however; and it is called Godhead. The mysterious thing we call life organizes itself into all living shapes, bird, beast, beatle and fish, rising to the human marvel in cunning dwarfs and in laborious muscular giants, capable, these last, of enduring toil, willing to buy love and life, not with suicidal curses and renunciations, but with patient manual drudgery in the service of higher powers. And these higher powers are called into existence by the same self-organization of life still</page><page sequence="29">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 33 more wonderfully into rare persons who may by comparison be called gods, creatures capable of thought, whose aims extend far beyond the satisfaction of their bodily appetites and personal affections, since they perceive that it is only by the establishment of a social order founded on common bonds of moral faith that the world can rise from mere sav- agery. [Works, XIX, 186] As though to emphasize this memorable point in his own mind as well as in the reader's, Shaw repeats it at the end of the chapter. This repetition is worth observing closely for its more precise foreshadow- ing of the terms he was to use later in reference to the Life Force: "After all, a god is a pitiful thing. But the fertility of the First Mother is not yet exhausted. The life that came from her has ever climbed up to a higher and higher organization. From toad and serpent to dwarf, from bear and elephant to giant, from dwarf and giant to a god with thoughts, with comprehensions of the world, with ideals. Why should it stop there? Why should it not rise from the god to the Hero? to the creature in whom the god's unavailing thought shall have become effective will and life, who shall make his way straight to truth and reality ... ?" (pp. 196-97). Both passages have rudimentary origins in Judas's perception of life's principle in the growth of wheat, and in "the world-will which is out- side Peer Gynt as well as inside him." A more immediate precursor appears in a letter of January 1897: "And never stagnate. Life is a constant becoming: all stages lead to the beginning of others" (Letters, I, 722). The second passage reflects Shaw's deep feminist strain: he goes back atavistically to the ancient sense of an Earth Mother, much as he did when in 1891 he suggested, probably echoing Goethe, that it was important to add the feminine to the Godhead. In the Ring he sees Brynhild embodying this primal spirit: "Brynhild is the inner thought and will of Godhead, the aspiration from the high life to the higher that is its divine element" (p. 208). Reflecting the instinctive aspects of the serpent, bear, and elephant in the above definition, Ann Whitefield of Man and Superman is described by her reluctant lover as a boa con- strictor, a grizzly bear, an elephant. And perhaps most telling of all, the speech of Lilith, the First Mother who ends Back to Methuselah, quite clearly has its origin in this conception. She too is an evolutionary force moving upward from instinct to thought which is tied to matter, and at last to godly thought which expresses will and life, truth and reality (cf. Plays, V, 629-31). The second godly type in the Wagnerite derives from the above, being an ultimate evolutionary fruit of the First Mother: this is the Hero, personified by Siegfried. Shaw calls Siegfried a New Protestant. In a passage we have observed previously in reference to Judas, he is</page><page sequence="30">34 CHARLES A. BERST defined as "a type of the healthy man raised to perfect confidence in his own impulses by an intense and joyous vitality which is above fear, sickliness of conscience, malice, and the makeshifts and moral crutches of law and order which accompany them" (p. 225). Here, obviously, is the embodiment of a superman, one who elicits Shaw's eugenic conviction soon to be expanded in Man and Superman, that "it is necessary to breed a race of men in whom the life-giving impulses predominate" (p. 227). According to Shaw's allegory and his professed convictions, Siegfried as the Hero, an ultimate fruit of the First Mother, ought to be the highlight of his discussion. But not at all. For all his health, instinct, and joy - or perhaps because of them - Siegfried is not very interesting. No sooner has Shaw exalted the Hero than he takes a look at him in terms of a third godly type, Wotan. The god, realizing the limitations of law and order and secretly desiring his own supersession, is a more intriguing, more dramatic figure. Dare one say a maturer figure? Shaw almost does: he compares Shelley's youthful conception of Jupiter as a melodramatic demon with Wagner's middle-aged understanding of Wotan's ambiguity. He then disparages the panacea of love which both Shelley and Wagner offer as a cure for the world's ills. According to Shaw the evolution of life, not love, must be life's goal. Presumably the spirit of Siegfried, expressing its selfhood freely and throwing over old institutions, represents this evolution. But does it? Socially Siegfried's free spirit threatens anarchy. At this point Shaw balks and reveals his ingrained Fabianism by adding anarchism to love as a false panacea: he believes that man's general welfare must rise from some social con- straints: "I must refer disciples of Siegfried to a tract from my hand published by the Fabian Society and entitled The Impossibilities of Anarchism" (p. 235). Are these the words of a disciple of Siegfried or of a prudent father figure; are they nearer to the spirit of Siegfried or Wotan? Despite his impulse to cheer the instinctive Hero, Shaw finds himself, almost before he knows it, defending an outpost of the god. Here Shaw appears to be tangled: his instincts urge him one way, his reason another. But there is a fourth godlike type involved in his analy- sis which is central and in large part resolves the problem. It is easy to miss, however, because it requires a broad focus, while details of the story's allegory tend to capture the reader's attention. This godlike type is the poet - the poetic sensibility in general and Wagner in particular. In analyzing The Rhine Gold at the start of his essay, Shaw stresses the modern relevance of Wagner's allegory and the importance of a poet's vision regarding the social realities it portrays. The Rhine Gold presents the dwarf Alberic exploiting hordes of fellow-creatures, lay- ing up gold at the expense of their slavery and health. To Shaw this is</page><page sequence="31">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 35 no mere legend but an allegory of immense contemporary value: it dramatizes the frightful reality of modern commercial life. And all too few persons perceive the ghastly social effects of such a state of af- fairs: "It is only the poet, with his vision of what life might be, to whom these things are unendurable. If we were a race of poets we would make an end of them before the end of this miserable century. Being a race of moral dwarfs instead, we think them highly respect- able, comfortable and proper, and allow them to breed and multiply their evil in all directions" (p. 185). Hence the poet is a unique seer who in accurately perceiving the present provides the motive for a better future. He is a godlike type apart from the others in the allegory of the Ring because his view is more penetrating and all-encompassing than theirs. Siegfried answers to the role of the Hero in his perfect self-confidence, but he lacks breadth of vision, and one side of his instinctive freedom is potential anarchy. Wotan controls anarchy and has some breadth of vision, but at the loss of instinctive freedom. The poet, on the other hand, com- bines both Siegfried's free-flowing instincts and Wotan's awareness of a social context; he embodies the two aspects of life which spring from the First Mother: life's growth and its organization. Shaw emphasizes Wagner's overarching poet's role by devoting his second chapter to "Wagner as Revolutionist." It might seem that Wagner, finally, is more in Wotan's camp, but this is only a partial view: the very tug of instinct and intellect in him is revolutionary. While his intellect may be engaged by Wotan, his instincts go out to Siegfried, and his instincts came first. In this respect, as we have briefly noted in looking at the Quintessence, Shaw likens him to Ibsen: "Richard Wagner, one of the greatest poets of our own day, has left us as many volumes of criticism of art and life as he has left musical scores; and he has expressly described how the keen intellectual activ- ity he brought to the analysis of his music dramas was in abeyance during their creation" (p. 54). In their discussions of the Wagnerite, critics have missed a most re- markable example of its concern about godhead and the hero, an ex- ample which also applies directly to the relationship of art and thought in Shaw. Clearly Shaw's analysis of Wagner's Ring furthered his con- ceptions about godhead, the superman, and the Life Force; but almost as pertinent to his essay is the fact that at exactly the same time he was writing it he was also working on Caesar and Cleopatra. Shaw started both works in April, 1898. On May 3 he wrote Richard Mansfield: " 'C &amp; C is the first &amp; only adequate dramatization of the greatest man that ever lived. I want to revive . . . the projection on the stage of the hero in the big sense of the word" (Letters, II, 90). One needs little ingenuity</page><page sequence="32">36 CHARLES A. BERST to see how closely "the hero in the big sense of the word" relates to the Wagnerite, and also that Shaw's desire to dramatize "the greatest man that ever lived" was very possibly an ambition to give flesh to the Wagnerite's mythical ethos. Quite likely he alludes to his ambition in his preface to Plays Pleasant - also, notably, written in 1898: "Now I am no believer in the worth of any mere taste for art that cannot produce what it professes to appreciate" (Plays, I, 372). The close relationship between the essay and the play gains further evidence in a reference to Caesar in the Wagnerite. At the end of the second chapter Shaw outlines the three orders of humans allegorized in the Ring: those people, respectively, who are equivalent to the greedy dwarfs, the stupid giants, and the talented gods. Beyond these, Shaw says, "History shews us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes." At this point Caesar is his one example: "Now it is quite clear - though you have perhaps never thought of it - that if the next generation of Englishmen consisted wholly of Julius Caesars, all our political, ecclesiastical, and moral insti- tutions would vanish . . . Julius Caesars would no more trouble them- selves about such contrivances as our codes and churches than a Fellow of the Royal Society will touch his hat to the squire and listen to the village curate's sermons." Shaw goes on to make the Caesarean type a signal example of Creative Evolution: "This is precisely what must hap- pen some day if life continues thrusting towards higher and higher organization as it has hitherto done" (pp. 201-2). Thus in the character of Caesar we have Shaw's Word made flesh, his prime human example of the Hero. And highly intriguing is the fact that Caesar resembles Wotan more than he does Siegfried, even though his spirit incorporates them both. Shaw gives a poetic clue to this spirit in Caesar's apostrophe to the Sphinx at the start of Act I. This, though it is one of the play's most memorable and often-cited speeches, has been only vaguely appreciated. Especially paradoxical and puzzling is its conclusion: "I am he of whose genius you are the symbol: part brute, part woman, and part god - nothing of man in me at all. Have I read your riddle, Sphinx?" (Plays, II, 182). The riddle has remained; at least no critics have read it clearly. Yet this speech gains poetic clarity and special force when it is understood in terms of Shaw's definitions in the Wagnerite: First, Caesar is part brute because far beyond the base brutality of the Ring's dwarfs and giants he possesses the instinctive nature of a Siegfried, being a man perfectly confident of his own impulses, above fear, malice, and the moral crutches of law and order. Despite his age, when action calls him at the ends of Acts II, III, and IV, Caesar leaps to its demands with all the instinctive vigor of a young hero. In Act II he bluntly ignores the</page><page sequence="33">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 37 religion of the theocratic Egyptians by sitting on a sacred tripod. In Act V he pardons Rufio's killing of Ftatateeta because it was not a judicial murder, but a "natural slaying." Second, Caesar is part woman because he embodies the life-oriented, evolutionary spirit of the First Mother. He savors life even in moments of peril and instinctively avoids killing except in the pressing demands of battle. Thus he plays with the kitten queen throughout the play, even when he is in extreme danger. In Act II he frees the Egyptian court when it is at his mercy; in Act III he refuses even to determine the identity of traitors from their captured correspondence; in Act IV he puzzles everyone by allowing the treacherous Pothinus to live as his guest. And, upon Pothinus' murder, his famous speech against ven- geance is a plea for the principle of life and evolution against man- kind's dog-eat-dog instincts for death and destruction. Third, Caesar is part god because he is Emperor, and, like Wotan, he must uphold law and order. In Act I he rapidly puts Ftatateeta in her place, advises Cleopatra about the role of queenship, and is hailed by his legions. In Act II he confidently manipulates the Egyptian court and shocks it by his straightforward demand for money, taxes being the mundane foundation for a government of law and order. At the start of Act III the obedience of the centurion and the sentinel to Caesar's commands attest to his natural role as absolute authority. In Act IV all look to Caesar as an almighty father figure, their ethic of vengeance having turned back upon them in earnest. And in Act V all, even the Egyptian gods, are in obÃ©issance to his supreme power. Yet for all his transcendence, power, and authority, Caesar, like Wotan, realizes that he is old and fit for the knife. To maintain his imperial rule he must rely on the likes of the treacherous Lucius Septimius, the doglike Rufio, and a stern law and order which makes the murder of Vercingetorix, along with the severing of the right hands of the Gauls, prudent necessities. There is a rottenness and hypocrisy in laws and government which appall Caesar's Siegfried-like instincts and life- oriented, First-Mother goals. Despite his triumphs he is, at the end, a bit world-weary; and as Wotan secretly desires his own supersession by the virile Siegfried, Caesar willingly proposes to send Antony to Cleopatra. Thus Caesar is part brute, part woman, and part god. There is noth- ing of man in him because there is nothing in him of the Rings greedy dwarfs and stupid giants - nothing of man's gross Philistinism. In see- ing in the Sphinx a spiritual counterpart and symbol of himself, he has read its riddle; and so, like Oedipus, has Shaw. But also, as in the Wagnerite, there is a fourth godlike type in Caesar and Cleopatra, one which overarches and synthesizes the rest: Caesar the</page><page sequence="34">38 CHARLES A. BERST poet. Just as Shaw presents the poet at the beginning of the Wagnerite, he reveals him in Caesar's opening speech. The man who perceives and embodies the Sphinx in such ambiguous, metaphorical, rhetorical terms is, most fundamentally, a poet. Caesar's exchanges with Cleopa- tra in Acts I and III are those of a poet playing and striving to open up the consciousness of youth. With the romance of a "poet-artist" he invokes the Nile god in Act IV. His perceptions of reality throughout the play are those of a poet cutting through life's many illusions. In Act IV he admires the poetry of Apollodorus and disparages the prosaic Romans as doers and drudgers; yet always for Caesar as for Shaw (and for the poets Shaw admires most) art must engage life and give it meaning. Thus in Act V when Apollodorus disparages Rome's ability to produce art, Caesar responds, "What! Rome produce no art! Is peace not an art? is war not an art? is civilization not an art? All these we give you in exchange for a few ornaments" (p. 288). It is in the light of this poet's vision, including his ambiguous essence as brute, woman, and god, that Caesar intuitively likens himself to Christ. Deploring the ethic of vengeance which the others have voiced in support of the killing of Pothinus, Caesar states, "If one man in all the world can be found, now or forever, to k n o w that you did wrong, that man will have either to conquer the world as I have, or be cruci- fied by it" (p. 277). Such knowledge is that of a poet, a prophet, a superman. Not only does it transcend that of Philistine dwarfs and giants, it is more self-conscious and wordly-wise than a Siegfried and spiritually deeper than a Wotan. Like Christ, Caesar knows that the way of true life is charity, but in a world of wolves the man of charity must either rule or be torn apart. In choosing charity he realizes that he walks a fine line between supernal life and ignominious death; but the glory of the life is worth the shadow of the death. In this manner Caesar moves with the pulse of the Life Force.42 Thus at the end of the 1890s Shaw completed his Trinitarian gospel, his big book of devotion which prepared the way for his forthcoming espousal of Creative Evolution, the Life Force, and the superman. Pri- marily through dramatic poetry he had conceived a sophisticated sense of godhead. Through engaging Ibsen's Galilean he saw the Son more clearly. In defending art against Nordau he explored art as Holy Spirit. In conceptualizing the allegory of Wagner's Ring he grasped the impli- cations of the Father in a new metaphoric, metaphysical, Life Force context. And, as though to provide a dramatic parable for his new gospel, he created the character of Caesar. As a prototype of the super- man Caesar embodies not only Wagner's allegory, he is also the Word made flesh: in toto he is a spiritual Father, an instinctive Son, and, as a manifestation of spiritual consciousness in action, the Holy Spirit.</page><page sequence="35">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 39 In Shavio-theological terms the Trinity which emerges from Shaw's gospel as of 1898 thus has a Father (or, more precisely, a Mother) which may be described most nearly as Life and which contains within it an organizing principle. The Son is the Hero who instinctively gives expression to this Life and its organizing principle. The Holy Spirit is Life in its evolutionary action, an action represented by the Hero. Most completely, philosophical poets are Heroes because through their art they perceive and articulate the Holy Spirit: insofar as they accordingly create, reveal, and redeem they are God in action, the Word made flesh. Hence, no doubt, the designation artÂ¿sÂ¿-philosopher in Man and Superman. Personally informed and inspired by this gospel, Shaw found himself ever closer to the poetic Jesus that he had glimpsed in his Passion Play. His terms and images were different from those of Jesus because they were aimed at the modern world, but they came from a kindred spirit: "we were both led to become preachers of the same doctrine in spite of different circumstances and by independent ways . . . whether Jesus be placed in a sub-species or in a super-species, it is a species to which I apparently belong philosophically."43 Notes 1.

See Evelyn Underhill, Mysticism (London: Methuen, 1912). 21. Essays and Letters, p. 87. 22. Ibid., pp. 83, 93, 86. 23. "A Defence of Poetry," ibid., pp. 33, 1-2. 24. Everybody's Political What's What? (London: Constable, 1944), p. 181. 25. A notable exception is R. F. Dietrich's Portrait of the Artist As a Young Superman: A Study of Shaw's Novels (Gainesville: Univ. of Florida Press, 1969). See also E. Nageswara Rao, Shaw the Novelist: A Critical Study of Shaw's Narrative Fiction (Masulpitam: Trivini, 1959); and Stanley Weintraub, "The Embryo Playwright in Bernard Shaw's Early Nov- els," TSLL, 1 (1959), 327-55. My argument adds a metaphysical stress to Dietrich's biographical view. 26. "Acting, by One Who Does Not Believe in It" (1889), in Platform and Pulpit, ed. Dan H. Laurence (New York: Hill, 1961), p. 20. 27. "Fiction and Truth" (1887), in Bernard Shaw's Nondramatic Literary Criticism, ed. Stanley Weintraub (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1972), pp. 16-17. 28. "Mr. Bernard Shaw's Works of Fiction: Reviewed by Himself" (1892), in Selected Non-Dramatic Writings of Bernard Shaw, ed. Dan H. Laurence (Boston: Houghton, 1965), p. 311. 29. Ibid., p. 312. 30. In a Great Tradition, p. 241.</page><page sequence="37">POETIC GENESIS OF SHAW'S GOD 41 31. Quoted in R. F. Rattray, Bernard Shaw: A Chronicle (Luton, England: Leagrave, 1952), p. 39; Letters, I, 48. 32. "Shaw's Works of Fiction," Selected Writings, p. 31 1. 33. Ibid., p. 313. 34.

See especially Whitman and Turco, to whom I am indebted at a number of points in this discussion. 39. Selected Writings, pp. 359, 363-64. 40. Ibid., p. 381. 41. For a full development of the allegory along these lines, see Turco, esp. pp. Ill - 18, and Whitman, pp. 124-28. 42. This point crosses swords with J. L. Wisenthal's argument in the next article. 43. Shaw on Religion, p. 81.</page></plain_text>
