<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLAY 0J. S.) The wrath of Athena: gods and men in the Odyssey. Princeton: University Press (for the Center for Hellenic Studies). 1983. Pp. xii+268. ,C23-90. This book gives us a fresh view of the Odyssey-not an inconsiderable achievement, especially since it tackles a (arguably the) central problem of interpretation: why Athena got angry at the hero and why she stopped. C. begins by analysing what the proem and other 'front matter' tell us about the character of the hero, and she establishes skilfully Homer's bias towards him compared to the consensus one can gather from other traditional witnesses to that devious character. C. brings out the artful strangeness and the significance of taking up his story at its turning point: 'the beginning of the Odyssey signals the end of Athena's anger' (5 I). She then reviews the relationship of 'Gods and Men' in the Homeric world-an excursus which will be helpful for the nonspecialist reader (all Greek is translated throughout). The last two chapters, Four and Five, are the crux. They analyse in some detail the encounter (or reunion, or reconciliation) of Odysseus and Athena on Ithaca in Book xiii, and develop C.'s theory that the poem has a 'double theodicy' or two contradictory theories about the concern of the gods with human ethical behaviour. I was not convinced. For example, her argument that Homer's gods 'hand out good and evil on the basis of caprice and whim rather than on the basis ofjustice' (219; there is a serious fudge, as footnote II on the same page almost acknowledges) uses a number of passages (Od. i 347-9, iii 2o8 f., iv 236 f., vi 187-90, xix 363-7, xx 201-3) which say simply that the gods reward and punish as they like. But your Olympian god is the kind of anthropomorphism that can 'like' you if you do the right thing. Given the non-personal aspect of Homeric ethopoiesis (the con- tractual rather than affective meaning of philos, for example, which C. does not always observe in translat- ing) this must have been at least as true in the 8th-7th centuries as it was for the author of the Euthyphro. The one apparent exception does not help either: Eurycleia's complaint (or warning?) that Zeus can decline to reward a pious city or person (xix 363-7; cf. II. iv 48 f.). This refers specifically to piety in cult; not behaviour toward other human beings-not, for exam- ple, to xenia, the paradigmatic social code where scholars have yet to detect a hair's breadth infraction of Homer's well-calibrated dispensation of justice. (C. misses this because she overlooks that xenia is a reciprocal obligation which Odysseus, like Paris, has violated from the guest standpoint, e.g. by eating Polyphemus' stores without invitation.) C.'s approach throughout is avowedly 'literary'; that is, innocent of oral theory, 'structuralist' advances in mythology, socio-economic interpretation, or recent discoveries through archaeology and/or linguistics of the meaning of hero cult, trusting instead in careful assessment of the traditional scholarly evidence from available Greek literary sources and her own keen appreciation of nuance in the narrative texture. One result is an admirable clarity of argument (no one accuses interdisciplinarians like myself or Prof. Nagy of clarity of argument). If she does sometimes 'make Homer clear' (Homeron saphenizein) where he did not wish to be, if she wants to make him primitive where he is sophisticated (by reducing ethics to cultus) and sophisticated where he is preliterate (ignoring traditional structural patterns in favour of literary nuance), this well-researched and yet original new study is nonetheless welcome. It asks the right questions, and offers answers that are sometimes startling, probably often accurate, always provocative. MICHAEL N. NAGLER University of California, Berkeley</page></plain_text>
