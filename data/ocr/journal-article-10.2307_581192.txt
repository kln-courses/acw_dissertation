<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-1994 INTRODUCTION It is with mixed feelings that I complete the last Archaeology in Greece that it is my task to prepare. The compilation is a heavy burden, particularly as the final stages fall in the heat of the summer, but the information the BSA Director gleans from the task in many ways outweighs this. This year's report is based on the Chronika of ADelt 42 for 1987. Once again I thank the Librarian of the BSA, Penny Wilson Zarganis, for the section on new publications; Yana Spence for translations from the German and David Turner for his specialist coverage of the Byzantine material. He prefaces his section: "Attention in AR is, as always, on newly reported or excavated sites and finds. For the extensive work given for cities and towns such as Thessalonike and Rhodes, only a selection of sites has been made. Further information can be found in ADelt 42 Chronika on which the report has been based." Press coverage is from 1.6.93 to 31.5.94. Again there seem fewer rash items (the basic caveat must remain however) but there is a mass of journalistic discussion of issues; the import- ance of Cultural issues in the Greek press is something that surprises visitors from other countries but is hardly surprising in that Greece itself can be said to be 'one vast museum'. I am particularly grateful to those who have sent me direct for inclusion copies of their press releases and specialist offprints. General issues that have taken much column space are: EU programmes for cultural development; the dangers of excessive tourism; the threat from earthquakes and the actual results of those hitting Elis, Patras and Crete; the Parthenon marbles (also on TV); the Mitsotakis collection; the neglect of sites, lack of guards (and their uniforms), lack of labelling (so often the complaint of visitors too). Greek finds overseas have also fea- tured prominently: the Marseilles 'trireme' (Greece has offered help in the excavation), Alexander the Great in China, Greek mosaics in Israel inter alia. Important new developments are: the policy of the Archae- ological Society to cease allowing personal excavations but to make them a corporate responsibility; proposed 'archaeological parks' not only in the centre of Athens but also inter alia an underwater one off the N Sporades; training programmes both for those already in the Archaeological Service but also for the public. Growing attention is being given to more recent buildings and a heritage list is being drawn up. It has been heart-warming to read accounts of some of the giants among the specialist workmen who have contributed so much to excavation since World War II. The difficult issue of guiding on sites in Greece is briefly mentioned in Express 27.2.94. Major public works which have been producing antiquities during the past year include the natural gas pipeline and the laying of the second track of the railway to Thessalonike; the development of the Via Egnatia may be expected to have a similar effect. Periodicals. The periodicals received by the BSA Library between 1.6.93 and 31.5.94 which have been covered for this report are: Anthropologika kai Archaeologika Chronika 3 (1988-9); Archaiologia 50 (1994); Archaiologike Ephemeris 130 (1991); 131 (1992); Archaiologiko Ergo ste Makedonia kai Thrake 5 (1991); Archaiologikon Deltion 41A, 42B 1&amp;2; Deltion tes Christianikes Archaiologikes Etaireias 46 (1991-2); Phokika Chronika 5 (1993); Siphniaka 3 (1993). Horos 8-9 (1990-1) has appeared and should be consulted by all epigraphers. Unfortunately the installation of compact shelving in the periodical room has coincided with the preparation of this part of Archaeology in Greece and, despite every effort, a few omissions have occurred which will be rectified next year. It must be noted that ADelt 42 covers the same ground as AEMTH 1 and that much of the information had already been foreshadowed by press coverage of the annual meeting of Northern archaeologists. Underwater archaeology has been well served both in the press and periodicals. Kathemerine Sunday Supplement 13.6.93 and Olympic Airways in Motion Summer- Autumn 1993 produced handsome coverage. Speleology has also been surprisingly well covered this year, not only with a full report in ADelt 42 but by a series of press releases. Museums and Collections: The Mycenaean Room of the National Museum has been reopened after a year's closure for refurbishment; the exhibits have been thinned and are now arranged in a more rational order. Also at the National Museum the Egyptian Collection is now on view, a magnifi- cent collection spectacularly arranged. The Alibizatou collec- tion has been put on display at the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art. There has been little or no progress on the issue of the new Acropolis Museum. New museums opened during the year include that at Archanes on Crete and the ethno- graphic museum at Serres; a list of ethnographic museums in the country is given in Eleutheros 8.10.93. Athens University has opened the museum section of its handsome new quarters on the slopes of Mt Hymettos, consisting of a study collection of pottery, artifacts and environmental materials as well as a gallery of casts. Two important Museum features have been noted in the press: a mobile museum (Bema 21.11.93) and a museum for the blind at Kallithea (Typos tes Kyriakes 5.12.93). Two pending moves should be noted: the establishment of a Byzantine Museum in Thessalonike will see the move of many of the glorious items from the Byzantine Museum in Athens back home to Thessalonike. (The matter has been much discussed in the press.) In addition, the finds from Mycenae which are presently in Nauplion are to be installed in the new museum on site in the not too distant future. This will allow other different material to be exhibited in Nauplion. Following the charges that much of the Mitsotakis' collec- tion is derived from illegal excavation, the issue of private collections has been much discussed. Some matters are still sub judice. New regulations both by UNESCO and by the Greek government are reported. The Aidonia treasure is to be returned to Greece and the return of other items collected long ago is reported. At least one gang of exporters of antiquities has been broken and some, but by no means all, items recently stolen recovered. Conferences: Among the many conferences, symposia and seminars held in Greece during the last year there is room to mention only that on Ancient Ship Building in July 1993, the 4th International Conference on the Restoration of the Acrop- olis Monuments in May 1994, and the celebration of 100 years of Swedish excavation in Greece with a meeting dedicated to The Sanctuaries of the Peloponnese. Exhibitions: As well as the new permanent exhibitions in the National Museum, there have been two important displays at the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art: that on the new discoveries at Eleutherna in west Crete (previously in Rethy- mno and moving on to the UK), and one on the quarrying of marble for the Parthenon called From Pendeli to the Parthenon. This was the personal achievement of Manolis Korres, the results of his researches and illustrated by his unique drawings. The Greek version of the accompanying book is published, the English awaited. Two exhibitions outside</page><page sequence="2">4 E.B. FRENCH Greece may also be noted: one in Hanover entitled The Macedonians, the Greeks of the North and one in Amsterdam Marmer in Beeld, Griekse sculptuur 600-100 V. Chr. both of which, for different reasons, excited considerable interest in the Greek press. It is pleasing to report the award of a prize to the exhibition The Mycenaean World as the best exhibition of 1992 when it appeared in Spain. Deaths: The passing of Melina Mercouri who was and symbolized the Greek Ministry of Culture for so long brings the end of an era. All those who worked with her miss her deeply and her memory will inspire new efforts to complete what she started. Another redoubtable lady of the archae- ological world died in May at the age of 92: Virginia Grace, whose work on stamped amphora handles led to a whole new discipline; she was one of the last of the band of women whose work came to symbolize the early years of the Agora excava- tions and she had remained a leading light among archaeol- ogists in Athens. Two of the leading archaeologists of the post- war years have also died: Emil Kunze of the DAI and John Cook of the BSA. Both contributed much to the re-establish- ment of archaeology in Greece in the late 40's and early 50's. Correction: The Editor apologizes for the omission from page 51 of AR 1992-93 of the end of the section concerning Phthiotis. The missing information has been included this year.

The find of 5th/4th Ct BC sculptural fragments amid garbage at a dump near Kaisariane is reported by Nea 2.12.93. Acropolis. Work in 1987 on the Propylaia is reported by T. Tanoulas in ADelt 42 Chr, 12-14. The recording of the N wing, started in 1986 in drawings at 1:20, continued and was almost completed. All indications of human activity of all periods have been recorded. The tops of the walls have been drawn at 1:10 so that the pieces from elsewhere incorporated to add a Med second storey can be identified and repositioned; almost all are still in place. Evidence of intervention in C times as well as R and later has been noted. The need to erect scaffolding in the stoa of the N wing compelled the removal of the architectural fragments stored here; the opportunity has been taken to catalogue them in detail. In both the N and S wing Med cuttings for the placement of horizontal support beams have been identified by the method of cutting. An area by the NW building was cleared to erect a temporary storage area and site office. An in-fill containing small architectural fragments of various dates showed that Kabbadias' excavation had reached the rock. More evidence was found of the Justini- anic cistern and new information concerning the A cistern. The possibilities for restoration of the Pinakotheke are dis- cussed in Mesembrine 17.194. An interesting feature on the current restoration work is published in Typos 30.1.94; others appear in various papers on 22.2.94 and there was a feature in Kathemerine 12.3.94 following the annual report on 21.2.94; the main focus of the year has been on study and recording. Work has started on the Temple of Athena Nike. (Apogeumatine 27.5.94) A feature on the Parthenon was published by ENA 25.8.93. Graphic illustrations produced by computer technology of the damage to the frieze since 1910 appeared in Mesembrine 9.9.93 with reports in other papers of similar date; this became clear with the removal of the W sections from the building. Following the removal the damage from the explosion of 1687 also became evident. Plans for the restoration of the pronaos are discussed on 6.4.94 passim. The discovery over the last years of pieces of six of the missing metopes is featured by Ethnos 26.5.94. Agora. The ASCS under Professor T.L. Shear Jnr. con- tinued excavations in 1993. He reports: "The areas under investigation during the season were four in number, of which three were in the newly excavated sections N of Adrianou. Here, further excavation was carried out both N and S of the Stoa Poikile, around the A altar of Aphrodite Ourania, and underneath the remains of the ER temple in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite. The fourth area investigated this season lay S of Adrianou in the vicinity of the Stoa Basileios. S of the Stoa Poikile and the masonry channel of the Eridanos River, the season's work began with removal of the lowest foundations of the Church of Ag. Nikolaos, the various architectural phases of which had been thoroughly studied and recorded last year. The small area available for investigation was the triangle bounded by the S and E foundations of the 19th Ct basement under the modem property 1370/27, and by the Eridanos channel. This is the first point at which it has been possible to excavate within the open square of the agora on the N side, and thus the stratigraphy was of particular interest for the light it shed on the history of grading and filling along the river channel which evidently caused the ground along its course to suffer repeatedly from erosion. Four major layers could be isolated each with various sub-phases and signs of minor refilling. The highest preserved surface of the agora floor covered a layer about 0.35m. deep that dated to the LR period. Beneath this was a hard, smooth clay surface that covered a deep artificial filling with masses of broken pottery of the 1st Ct AD. Prior to the deposit of this filling, the floor surface of the agora had gradually risen as much as 0.50m. during the HL period. Under this gradual accumulation was the third major layer, the surface of which was an uneven stony floor pierced by numerous post holes. This layer also produced much broken pottery datable to the end of the 4th Ct BC. The lowest surface of the agora floor uncovered this season consisted of hard, compacted sand sloping downwards from the S to the edge of the river channel, and the pottery found beneath it showed that the layer was datable to the late 5th Ct BC. N of the Stoa Poikile, work continued in the area of the private commercial building that bordered the N-S street from the 4th Ct BC onward to the end of antiquity. Here the remains of a small Byz chapel had been explored during the 1992 season. The removal of its foundations this year enabled us to establish the date of its original construction in the late 10th or early 11th Ct AD. Just E of the chapel, there came to light the partially preserved courtyard of a neighboring Byz house, which could be identified by its characteristic household well. The dumped filling at the top of the well shaft showed that it went out of use in the 13th Ct. Although the well could not be excavated to its full depth because of the collapse of its tile lining, a few complete water jars and other household pots were recovered from the fill of its period of use. These suggested that the house and its well were in use by the middle of the 11th Ct. All the Byz structures in this area had incorpor- ated into their fabric earlier walls belonging to the LR phase of the C commercial building. These had survived the Dark Age and were ready to hand for the Byz builders because of their characteristically strong construction, consisting of rubble masonry interspersed with bricks and tiles, all set in hard lime mortar to form solid concrete walls. The Byz construction was fully removed after systematic documentation so as to leave the building exposed in its LR configuration. This season's work revealed a large rectangular room with its walls oriented on precisely the same alignment as both the earlier C building and the later Byz chapel and private dwellings. The tiled floor of the LR room was found partially preserved, lying at a level about im below the Byz floors, and about im above the original floor of the C building. The room was certainly used in this form until the late 6th Ct AD, but the date at which the LR construction was carried out cannot be established without excavation beneath the tiled floor during the 1994 season. Continuous pumping of the water from the Eridanos River Channel throughout the season enabled us to lower the water table in the areas on both sides of the channel by as much as 1.30m. Thus for the first time it was possible to investigate the deepest stratified fills of the A and earlier periods. A deep trench was dug across the N end of the Stoa Basileios extend- ing from behind its W wall E as far as the Great Drain. Within the stoa much of the N end of the building was filled with an artificial filling of large stones dumped in loosely, apparently to raise the ground level of the terrace on which the stoa was built, virtually on the bank of the Eridanos. Above and amongst the stones were deep fills of earth without significant stratigraphy. No trace of any earlier structure was found below the stoa, and the lower fill yielded pottery extending in date from PG through A down to the date of the stoa's construction ca 500 BC. Much of the same situation was found just in front of the stoa's crepidoma beneath the 5</page><page sequence="4">Y n 0 M N H M A I I VN7 T A ( 0 1 t i , T t J 0 ''' 1000 2000 M c B A A N E !

Pottery from what should be the ground level in front of the stoa came down through the 2nd quarter of the 5th Ct, indicating once again that the grade was maintained at its original level for the first 40 years or so of the building's life. Beneath this ground level a deep layer of fill could be dated ca 500 BC. The most interesting area of investigation was along the N half of the stoa's W foundation. Here the polygonal euthynteria rests on surprisingly light rubble foundations set only on fill near the centre of the building. Further N, as the natural slope drops sharply toward the river bed, the foundations become much more substantial. A large deposit of pottery of the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the 5th Ct came to light in hard packed fill all along the polygonal foundations. The group consists largely of drinking cups of good quality, many bearing impressed decoration and a few rf, and among the drinking cups were numerous fragments of kraters. In both date and composition the deposit is very similar to the large group of public dining ware found in a pit only a few metres to the W, and published in Hesperia Supplement XXV. Its position, hard up against the foundations of the stoa, shows that the rough rubble stonework along the blank back wall was left exposed to view until about 430 BC. This 5th Ct deposit was sealed by the construction of a rectangular terracotta drain channel which was set along the W wall of the building in the 4th Ct BC, no doubt to carry off rain water from the roof. In the area of the ER temple in the sanctuary of Aphrodite Ourania, further excavations were carried out this season which had been impossible in the past because of the high level of the water table. Deep beneath the pronaos and cella of the temple, there came to light the remains of a C house. Only one end of the structure was preserved under the temple, and most of that had suffered greatly both from the construc- tion of the temple itself, and from later disturbances of all periods. Nevertheless the N, S, and E limits of this part of the house could be established; parts of five small rooms could be differentiated; and in a few places sequences of stratified earth floors could be investigated. The S exterior wall lay beneath the pronaos a few metres N of the A marble altar. It consisted of fine polygonal masonry fashioned of acropolis limestone and probably served as a socle for a superstructure of mud-brick. On the E the house fronted on the N-S street. A short section of the polygonal E wall was found further N under the cella of the temple, but the original wall had been plundered at the SE corer and that which was found belonged to a reconstruction of the EHL period. Under the N end of the cella, and almost aligned with the temple itself, was a poros water channel of the kind which would have drained a narrow alley on the N side of the house, but of the N wall only a few patches of the lowest foundation packing were actually preserved. The water channel formed a right angle around the NE corer of the C house and continued down the street along its E wall. The E end of the house consisted of two rectangular rooms side by side of roughly equal size. A narrow room, perhaps a corridor, lay to the W of the N room, and two more rooms continued further W beyond the limits of the temple, but these have been mostly obliterated by the temple itself and by later construction to the W of it. The SE corer room provided the best sequence of stratified floors, although for the later phases of the house the floors were only preserved in a narrow strip of fill along the foundation for the cross wall of the temple. Here a series of several floors extended from the late 3rd to the middle of the 2nd Ct BC. The two and a half centuries from the middle of the 5th to the end of the 3rd were completely absent from the stratigraphy in this room, for just beneath a floor of the end of the 3rd Ct came several which dated to the 2nd quarter of the 5th Ct. The house seems to have been badly damaged at the time of the Persian destruction of the city in 479 BC, for under a layer which could be closely dated ca 475, there was found a layer of burned destruction debris which had all the characteristic hallmarks of the Persian sack and its aftermath. The fill consisted of masses of stones, disintegrated mud-brick, and broken roof tiles from the superstructure of the building, and mingled with the debris was an unusual quantity of broken household pottery datable to the 1st two decades of the 5th Ct. In the SE room, three floors were found below the destruction layer, all datable to the last quarter of the 6th Ct BC. Levelling of the site preparatory to the construction of the building disturbed a burial of an earlier period. Set down in a pit under the first floor of the house was the lower half of a small amphora probably datable to the early 7th Ct, although the preserved part of the vessel was undecorated. This contained the skeletal remains of a very young child buried without funerary offerings of any kind. In the N room of the house, a small section of stratified floors was preserved at the SE corner of the room. This yielded much the same evidence as the S room. Two floors were as late as the middle of the 5th Ct, while several dated to the 2nd quarter of the century, although there was no substantial accumulation of debris from the Persian destruction comparable to that found further S. The four lowest floors all belonged to the last quarter of the 6th Ct, the first of which seems to have been laid down shortly after ca 525 BC. It was only here that any evidence was found concerning the functions of any of the spaces in the building. Above one of the clay floors in the corner of the N room were found four separate layers of working chips from the cutting of island marble, and inter- spersed among them were some chips of fine, tan poros. The island marble can scarcely be associated with the construction of the house itself and in the last quarter of the 6th Ct is more likely to have been used for sculpture than for architecture. This material does suggest, however, that during the early years of its occupation at least one room of the house served as a shop for the working of marble." Inside the walls. In sewage work on Chatzechrestou R sewers and other building remains were found but the restricted area prevented close dating. (ADelt 42 Chr, 17-9) In the National Garden part of the Valerian wall came to light, running N-S with a width of 2.46m. The construction was of two periods of which the second was considerably less good. Earlier R building remains were found incorporated in a 4th Ct AD building of high quality. (ADelt 42 Chr, 15) The interesting finds at Tripodon 28 in the Plaka area and the work on the building as a whole, which won it the Europa Nostra prize in 1992, are the subject of an extensive article in Kathemerine 5.12.93. Stadium. Eleutheros 15.6.93 queries what became of the columned entrance to the restored stadium that appears in photographs as late as 1942. The Metro. The Archaeological Service has continued to give monthly press briefings on the work and to keep the public fully informed, including the English language press (Athens News 22.3.94 and The Athenian June 94). The lecture by L. Parlama reported AR 1992-93, 7 has been republished in Horos. Fig. 1 shows the state of knowledge of the antiquities of Athens before the start of the metro excavations. The finds this year have clarified those reported last year, rather than adding anything spectacular. Syntagma remains the most important. It is now suggested that the workshops had a connection with the cemetery. The road to the Mesogeia with</page><page sequence="6">E.B. FRENCH Fig. 2 its gate, the well-preserved bed of the Eridanos, and part of the Ott Haseki fortifications may be noted. The total of new tombs at the Kerameikos has risen to 460; of interest are a group of the early 5th Ct BC and those belonging to the Peloponnesian War. The edge of the cemetery area at the W seems to have been found, with the start of an area of workshops. By the Larisa station only a drain is reported. Unfortunately this excellent public relations exercise led to a theft of sherds from one of the storerooms, reported by Eleutherotypia 14.1.94. A visit to the Syntagma excavations for archaeologists was arranged before the site was handed back to the contractors; a museum here for finds from the whole project is planned. Outside the walls. (ADelt 42 Chr, 15-28 with plan) Only one piece of rescue work is reported for the area S of the walls: at Theophilopoulou 13 a brick-built rectangular structure of two building phases came to light, with a bothros and tombs adjacent. Dating by the finds assigns these to LR (late 4th to mid 5th Ct AD). Two excavations were carried out near the Academy of Plato: on Kreontos (OT 18) a stout wall of large and small stones came to light; sherds were mainly HL but some LR was present (6th Ct AD red slipped ware and a piece stamped with the figure of a dancing girl). Below lay a Myc and MH level and lower still the EH known from the area with the river wash below. Work was carried out on the lowest levels in the gymnasium of the Academy (with a legacy from the family of the original excavator). The building was founded on LG but there was evidence of some 4th Ct material and some of the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC. Of the PR settlement more evidence of EH I and II was recovered with obsidian in the river wash; black burnished Final N was also identified. Beneath the Plateia Dikaiosounes two cisterns with circular openings came to light, one lined with cement and the other with tiles; the latter may have been later connected with metal working. Pottery was mainly R but included both C and Byz. No date is suggested for the constructions. Scattered tomb evidence is reported from two areas N of the walls and from Ano Patesia (Prompona 8) where a group of four tombs dating to the mid 5th Ct BC and of varied types must represent an outlying settlement rather than the city itself. Extensive work is also reported from the C cemetery by the road from the Sacred Gate to the Academy and along the Sacred Way. At Monasteriou and Naupliou more evidence of the destruction of the C potters' quarter by 4th Ct tombs came to light. The cemetery by the Sacred Way was in continual use from the 8th Ct BC to LR as evidenced by work at Kastorias 55 of which a summary report is given. Two inscriptions are noted: (EYDPOZYNH XAIPEDANOYX/ PA MNOYZIOY OYFATHP, a base, and AAPIETOKAHZ/ KTHZIKAEOYE/ BEPENIKIAH2 a column). Widening of the mod. Sacred Way beyond the Kephisos brought to light much evidence which had lain below the pavements on either side. The actual road surface, the edging blocks and the drains were identified and in one place as many as seven relayings were noted. Tombs of the 4th and early 3rd Cts were the most common but there were also LR ones making use of earlier material. One inscription is noted: KAAAIXTPA[TH]. The find of a rich unrobbed R tholos tomb at Arabantinou 1 (just E of the National Garden) is reported by Kathemerine 1.4.94. Gkyze. The neglect of the antiquities on the site of the Lyrike Skene is noted by Auriane 30.11.93. Kerameikos. Activities by the DAI in 1993 were under direction of Dr U. Knigge and included once again earth removal and restoration. She reports: "The focal point was the excavation of the Sacred Gate by Dr G. Kuhn with the aim of clarifying the Themistoclean and EHL building phases in the area of the Eridanus, starting with the Themistoclean phase. The channel inside the gate had already been largely cleared and photographed during the 1930s under the direction of Karl Ktibler, but at that time the work had to stop. In order to clear the bottom of the channel and the early foundations of the gate again, the fill had to be removed. This was done partly by machinery. Under the clearly visible EHL corbel vault which carries the viaduct and one bastion, an impressive Themistoclean pavement came to light at the bottom of the stream (Fig. 2). Today it is still 6m long and consists of a double row of large poros ashlar combined with polygonal limestone blocks, and shows a similar arangement to the foundations of the S curtain wall. It extends over the full width of the river bed (ca 7 m), but because of later structures could not be followed to the edges, which are formed by the embankment foundations. This year's excavations have shown that the purpose of the paving was to strengthen the river bed. Originally it extended over the whole channel inside the gate. In building Y the excavation of cistern 5 in the peristyle ended the work on all cisters. Cistern 5 is ca Im wide and about 7m deep; walls and bottom are thickly plastered. There are four or five access holes in the upper third of the walling. Close to the bottom two narrow blocked passages, which are 2.40-2.70m high, lead S and W respectively and must original- 8</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 9 ly have connected with cisterns 1 and 4 S and W of the peristyle. Clear evidence for such a connection could not be obtained, since these cisterns are in danger of collapse and only shallow excavation was possible. The restoration and strengthening of the S curtain-wall made good progress, although the work is not finished. The top of the curtain-wall had to be deeply hollowed to saw off the thick roots of caper-bushes which push the wall outward and threaten its stability. The removal of earth connected with this task brought to light only R sherds, the latest dating from the beginning of the 4th Ct AD. Among them was a small terracotta head, perhaps of a satyr. A welcome addition to the Kerameikos Museum is a roof over the front which was finished last year. This year, grave monuments were set up which had been brought to the Museum or the Apotheke to save them from destruction by pollution. It allows the museum to show to the public many monuments which have long been hidden away. Financial help from the Theodor Wiegand Society enabled us to continue our programme of casting replicas, which started in the seventies, but was interrupted soon after. Further monuments, for instance the Lekythos of Aristomache (Fig. 3), were copied." ATTICA (2nd Ephorate and Eleusis and Megara) Acharnai. In 1987 at Liosion 36, a R bath complex used later for storage (11 pits were cleared) came to light. As well as R some HL sherds were found; a 4th Ct BC gabled stele with a public inscription on both sides had been reused as covering for a drain (published by G. Stainchaouer in AE 131 (1992) 199-3). A major section of the deme's cemetery with graves dating from PA to the 3rd Ct AD came to light at Themistokle- ous 4 (OT 332); the name of one of the dead was given (KHWIZOAQPOZ AXAPNEYE). Other evidence of cemeteries was found at Philadelpheias and Leukadas 4 (larakes and burial urns of children, dating from the mid 5th Ct BC to the 1st quarter of the 4th) and on ZaYme (C poros sarcophagus with grave goods) where other tombs had been noted previously. (ADelt 42 Chr, 62-7) Alimos. Excavation was carried out in 1987 at Bouliagmenes 516 where a low hill (cut by the main avenue) was known to be a Myc and EH site. The Myc levels (assigned to LH IIIB) produced two houses built on the rock, one with megaron (central column), porch, court and subsidiary rooms, the other, possibly earlier, with a large central area. Notable are the copious roofing slabs and the built stands in the NE corers of the subsidiary rooms, possibly for the storage of cooking and other domestic utensils. A rock-cut path was cleared beside the complex and beyond it rock-cut rubbish pits containing much sherd material. EH remains were found below in the wash from a streambed. (ADelt 42 Chr, 68-9) Aphidna. Illicit excavation on this important BA site is reported in Nea 21.1.94. Argyroupole. The chance find in 1987 of the headless statue of a sphinx in the severe style, in Plateia Marathonomakon, led to further excavation and trials which were to be continued. A workshop for the production of tiles was found, with a kiln and a covered area for pre-drying. To the W were two houses disturbed by electricity and telephone trenching. The whole complex can be dated to the 4th Ct BC, but finds of other periods can be expected. (ADelt 42 Chr, 69-70) Bariote hill. The find of 13.5.94. a R tomb is reported by Ethnos Chalandri. ADelt 42 Chr, 107 reports the recovery of a marble lekythos of the 4th Ct BC. Dionysos. In 1987 at Aigaiou and Ariadnes a funerary enclos- ure came to light. It was bounded partly by the cut natural rock at the sides. Finds included marble lekythoi, loutrophoroi, columns and drums and a base. Two pyres were cleared with no pottery. Such pots as were recovered consisted of small bg pots of the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 42 Chr, 99) Glyka Nera. The ongoing saga concerning the fate of this Myc ChT cemetery and the finds from it is reported in Eleuthero- typia 13.8.93. Eleusis. Six rescue excavations are reported for 1987 in ADelt 42 Chr, 28-34, in addition to repairs and restoration on the main site. At Demetros and Chatzedake (OT 124), the site of the new Demarcheion produced a section of the R aqueduct, including portions of the fallen upper section and allowing reconstuction of the whole. On Persephones (OT 182) one course of a heavy wall came to light with, on the E, part of the LR cemetery. This had 18 very closely-packed, tidily arranged burials (some without offerings, the others with ribbed jugs, glass tearbottles and bone pins). At Byronos and Ikoniou (OT 212 and 211) a strong wall running some 19m was revealed; it appears to be a terrace, probably the facing of a road or an anti-flood measure, as nothing is known to the W and this plot lies some distance from the settlement (though only 12m N of the sanctuary). The construction can be dated to the 4th Ct (on building style) with rebuilding in the HL period. During work on the football stadium, an unrobbed Pentelic marble sarcopha- gus of the 2nd Ct AD came to light from the W cemetery, with plain box and decorated lid. This is the first of this type from this cemetery, though a similar example is known from the Sacred Way. Finds included a bronze mirror and a glass tearbottle; a bronze coin had been placed in the mouth of the dead person. Iron nails indicate that a wooden bier had been Fig. 3</page><page sequence="8">10 E.B.

At Thebon and Persephones (OT 133) improvements to an old building led to the uncovering of a small area of R hypocaust from a bath complex of the 2nd Ct AD with much fallen debris from the superstructure. There had also been later overbuilding and below other material including a pyre and the fragments of a G pyxis came to light. Glyphada. Seven rescue excavations are reported in ADelt 42 Chr, 70-3 for 1987. Three had traces of terrace walls but only that at Patron and Korytsas is given a function; this, though undatable from lack of sherds, is thought to be a field terrace. At Lazarake 38 the boundary wall of a C roadway (two surfaces) came to light, and on Themistokleous and Aigines (Plat. Pyrrou) there was a similar road boundary, though the road itself had been destroyed; here too were two tombs, a robbed-out built cist, and a slab cist with two R pots. A rock- cut tomb covered with slabs and containing seven G pots was found at Kyprou and Eras. The only structural evidence came to light at M. Alexandrou and Patriarchou Gregoriou (OT 481) where there was a R house in an enclosure with typical tiles and sherds. Kallithea. At Theseos 191 a group of tombs and pyres, datable on pottery evidence to the 5th Ct BC, with an enclosure wall came to light in 1987. By the metro station, during measures to run a new drain below the known section of the anc. wall, a section of a marble grave stele was noted. (ADelt 42 Chr, 61) Kalybia. A 5th Ct BC marble loutrophoros was found in the office of a local man and handed in to the Archaeological Service. (Eleutheros 10.12.93) Phoinikia. In 1987 a burial enclosure came to light, much robbed and destroyed but datable by pottery to A and C; it would presumably have lain by the anc. road but no actual evidence for the road was found. (ADelt 42 Chr, 97-8) Kephisia. On Drosine in 1987 work by the Electricity com- pany brought to light a R wall with plastered face, other walls and floors, and R tile graves cutting into the floor level. Architectural fragments indicate that the structure relates to the nearby Nymphaion. On Kyriaze and Ag. Theodoron, walls and a plastered floor could be assigned to LByz but other remains were obviously earlier; marble architectural fragments were collected also from the adjacent plot. (ADelt 42 Chr, 98-9) Koropi. In 1987 further excavation in the grounds of the Health Centre was carried out. Walls of the EH IIb settlement were found with the tomb of a young man below the floor of a courtyard area. The most notable find was a clay seal. The upper levels contained G and later sherds. (ADelt 42 Chr, 97) Marathon-Oinoe. In 1987 sewerage work disclosed more of the cemetery lying some 800m SE of the Med tower. It dates from G to R and contained graves of all types; to note are: occasional contracted burials in pits; pyres with burial urns on top closed with a slab; slab enclosures in the shape of the letter I. Some 100m E of the Med tower were well-built R baths (much damaged and with few finds); marble exedrae, cisterns, antifixes inscribed AOHNAIOY are reported. The area is covered by a later fill and by later walls containing spolia. Part of a late antique structure came to light 500m W of Ag. Paraskeue. (ADelt 42 Chr, 99-102) Among items recovered from the Marathon district in 1987 are a gabled funerary stele inscribed ANTIA^PInnIIO KH4IZIEYX and the hand of an overlifesize marble statue. The material from both the gateway of Herodes Atticus' estate at Aulona and from the Mesoporitissa have been taken to the Marathon Museum for safekeeping. (ADelt 42 Chr, 107-8) Markopoulo. In 1987 on I. Staurou another section of the known 5th Ct cemetery came to light with evidence of pyres. (ADelt 42 Chr, 97) Marousi. In OT 120 at Epeirou and Ionos a tile grave came to light in 1987 containing a small conical glass object of unknown use; also found were eight pyres, several with no offerings or only burnt fragments lekythoi. Such pottery as was found was not datable. (ADelt 40 Chr, 98) Megara. For 1987 a detailed report (with plan) of 16 pieces of rescue work is published in ADelt 42 Chr, 34-49. In addition two inscriptions were collected from the demolition of old buildings: from Prytaneio 10: EnIIK[THTOX]/ II1I.... and from Byzantos (OT 130): ..../ A..... with [N]IKOMAXO[X]/ [A]HMHTPIO[Y] on the reverse. At Eupalinou on the NW edge of the town, a section of the city wall came to light almost on the surface which from its uneven building style and width can be assigned to the older phase of the walls, from the period of the Persian wars or at least before 460 BC. Some 7m to the N (with a roadway between) lay a small section of shallow outwork which seems contemporary with the wall, in which case it would be one of the earliest 5th Ct outworks existing. Basements of the type typical in Megara came to light in five plots, of which one was a double example. Evidence was found of pilasters and wooden stairs, and a varied selec- tion of domestic items such as tearbottles, loomweights, large clay vessels, female figurines and lamps. Dating is 4th Ct or HL. Other structures date from the 6th Ct BC to LR and EByz. Notable is an EByz stoa at Prytaneio and D. Schina (OT 161) which formed the E side of the agora. It had unfluted columns of grey stone, presumably Ionic, and shows the importance of the town at this period. It may have had a prostoa giving a total width of 11.14m instead of 7.05m. One column drum was inscribed (Fig. 4). Also of EByz date was a building at Sp. Schina 10 with walls of small stones and mud, with two rows of tile; traces of marble cladding were noted in the E of the two rooms preserved. At the W of the plot at Palaiologou 48 were two small cisterns which may be connected with a dump of pottery, probably from a pottery workshop found adjacent in previous rescue excavation. The old name for the area was 'keramidadiko'. Roadways were cleared on the S slopes of the acropolis (running from the S to the gate at the NW), at</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 Minoas 13A, with R paving and drain but dating back to the 4th Ct BC, and at G. Mauroukake and Chr. Moraite, where part of the Street called Straight leading from the E corer of the agora to Nisaia came to light. Tombs were found in five plots in outer areas. They date from LG to LC with the earlier ones being particularly well-equipped. Of interest was a contracted cist burial, a LG/A custom in a later period. Alepochori: Pyrgari. A group of tombs, all robbed in antiquity, came to light here which, from traces of gold wreaths etc in the soil, probably originally date to the 4th Ct BC to the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC (when other burials and reburials were placed close by). Six are two storey with traces of wooden biers; an inscribed slab .NQ/ .IQNOX probably indicates that tomb markers were used. In addition there are two plain ECh burials. A hoard of 21 bronze coins of the 2nd Ct AD was found in T 8. (ADelt 42 Chr, 49) Villia: Bryse Tsias. Three cist graves of the 5th/6th Ct AD were found at this site ca. lkm W of the town. Traces of walling suggest that this is the site of an ECh country house. (ADelt 42 Chr, 49) Melissia. ADelt 42 Chr, 107 reports the find of a boundary stele of the 2nd Ct BC in Pentelic marble: HOPO/ IEPO/ MHTP. This would be the edge of the deme Phlyas and if the third line is restored as Demeter then this is the first archae- ological evidence for this cult mentioned by Pausanias. Merente. A marble slab with Ch inscription (not given) came to light near the church. (ADelt 42 Chr, 97) Moschato. At Eleutherias 57 a tower from the long walls was excavated in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 60-1) Nea Liosia. In 1987 during building work a marble sarcopha- gus was found at Patroklou and Danaon, of which the gabled lid had been disturbed. A complete bg lekythos of the end of the 4th Ct BC was found between the legs of the skeleton. A C poros sarcophagus and another HL marble one were found nearby. (ADelt 42 Chr, 62) Nea Makre. The danger that a marina might be built by the N site is reported in Eleutherotypia 5 &amp; 7.10.93; the decision of the Central Archaeological Council has been for the moment postponed. Paiania. Near the church of Ag. Panteleemon ploughing revealed a burial pithos with a lekythos of the 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 40 Chr, 97) Palaia Phokaia: Kataphyki. A burial tumulus (30m diameter) with an associated funerary structure, similar to that excavated at nearby Anavyssos (AR 1991-92, 7), was cleared on Bryou- lon. There were 44 graves and burials in pots or pits, much robbed, dating from the mid-8th to the end of the 6th Ct BC. There is another tumulus in the plot opposite which apprears to have suffered heavy damage. (ADelt 42 Chr, 96-7) Peristeri. In 1987 at Krenes 7 a marble sarcophagus came to light, datable by the pottery finds to the 4th Ct BC. A further three tombs were found at the corer of Giannitson and Kennenty, one cist (with a few grave goods) and two tile- covered (without offerings). (ADelt 42 Chr, 61-2) Piraeus. Rescue work in 1987 is published in some 35 reports in ADelt 42 Chr, 53-60. The majority describe the common finds of the outer areas of the city: quarries, wells, drains etc. Two major pieces of work along Leophoros Thebon, in order to lay a rainwater drain, and by the Telephone company, brought to light long series of graves and funerary monuments. In one section, between B. Epeirou and Marmara, traces of the walling beside the anc. road came to light. Other cemetery material came from two excavations on Delabere and another at Phragkoule 3. Evidence of housing was found only within the boundary of the anc. city and only one site proved of real interest. At Neorion 114-8 a large well-built HL complex was cleared on the SW slope of the Mounichia near the harbour. It comprised a large court, four andrones with pebble mosaic floors and decorated walls, and a bath with dedicated water system. The stone (as elsewhere in Piraeus) was cut on site and the complex is terraced on the slope. Coin evidence dates from 350-330 with one of 330-322 BC. The excavator states (perhaps euphemistically) that the purpose must have been the reception and accommodation of crews from the ships. Walling and an unfluted column drum, which may come from a ship- shed, came to light at Bouboulinas and Akte Moutsopoulou. I. Petrocheilou publishes reliefs to Cybele in AE 131 (1992) 21-65. Ramnous. (AR 1992-93, 12) B. Petrachos publishes a full account of his work in 1990 in PAE 1-39 and reports on his work in 1993 in Ergon 1-9. Along the S road one of the 4th Ct BC funerary monuments fell apart in the rains, which enabled a new detailed study of its architecture and dating before rebuilding. It was of two phases and two more tombs, robbed in antiquity, came to light. In the fort, excavation of the small shrine of the 1st Ct AD (proably a heroon) was completed: the long cella appears to have been half-roofed and had a court with a hearth; there were stoas on two sides and a bench. A new find is the boundary stone of the Hero Archegetos (known from the 6th Ct) but he is too important to be the hero of this relatively poor shrine. At the S gate an underground structure of rough steps leading to a passage, covered with stones, rock or presumably wood, was cleared. The excavator interprets this as counter-trenching against a siege engine. One side was built of blocks taken from buildings. It can be dated to the begin- ning of the 3rd Ct BC. In addition the site produced a further harvest of important historical inscriptions which are discussed without texts. Repair of the SW wall was carried out. Kathemerine 28.6.93 in its Kyriatike Periegese section features this delightful site. The threat of further quarrying in the area was widely reported during the summer of 1993 but was taken to the Constitutional Court in December; Nea 14.4.94 reports their decision to ban quarrying. Raphina. In 1987, in a plot a short way S of the R baths, further evidence of this building complex came to light. (ADelt 42 Chr, 102-3) Skala Oropou. In 1987 extensive excavation W of that previously carried out produced much evidence of the W cemetery, dating from the end of the 5th Ct/beginning of the 4th Ct BC to LR; 45 burials of EHL to LR were excavated; many inscriptions were recovered with many personal names. In addition there were four large structures and part of another; these and other buildings are said to be of various dates, both pre and post the usage of the cemetery.

Goette of the DAI reports: "At the N edge of the Demos Sounion, above the Souriza and Agriliza valleys, a large farmstead was explored by surface survey. It consists of a main and several auxiliary buildings and has a threshing floor and a rock-cut cistern (Fig. 5). The construction technique of the walls, the sherds spread around, and numerous fragments of roof tiles date the use of the farm to the 4th Ct BC. The main building is of special interest: built of large stone blocks and slabs in a notable technique, it demonstrates by its large size, an open courtyard, a stone stairway to the upper storey and pottery of quality etc., the elevated life-style of its owner. It is unusual among the agricultural buildings of S Attica, where only few comparable farms are found. The owner was perhaps not only engaged in farming (cereals, olives and vines), but derived the greater part of his income from the silver mines which are but a few metres away. He probably left the large farm house soon after the middle of the 4th Ct BC and apparently took away part of the movable property. For instance, only two fragments of a Sicilian roof, consisting of thick tiles ca. 60cm long, were discovered; all the others are missing from the main building, while in contrast large quantities of tile fragments were found around the auxiliary structures. Another remarkable fact is that the tiles of the 'manor house' were not of Attic clay and their shape suggests that they were probably A, which means that they were at least 100 years old when they were used at Souriza. Because of their value they were carefully removed and taken away two generations later." Thorikos. The decision of the Central Archaeological Council to allow extension of the industrial area near this site is reported in Rizospastes 24.3.94 et al. Tsepi. In 1987 some 250m SE of the EH cemetery site the line of the anc. road was found lying parallel to the mod. main road some 50m W; it can be dated to the 4th Ct BC on the building style of the boundary walls. Two pieces of a C marble grave stele and a pyre of the end of the 4th Ct BC were uncovered. A pottery workshop area with kilns, clay store and wasters was excavated. (ADelt 42 Chr, 102) Vari. Reports are given in ADelt 42 Chr, 91 of the two major pieces of rescue work for 1987. In the grounds of the Health Centre a strong wall was found, thought to be the peribolos of a cemetery, which can be dated by a bf lekythos to the 1st half of the 5th Ct BC. Burials comprised a robbed monolithic sarcophagus with gabled lid and a pyre similarly dated by fragments of bf lekythoi; other finds included a marble base and a marble lekythos. In the nearby grounds of the Primary School two strong terrace walls running N-S are interpreted as the boundaries built (in masonry almost polygonal) to prevent a stream from overflowing its banks; a date is given by bg and bf sherds of the 5th Ct BC. Lathouriza. The excavation of two large plots on the NE and SE slopes of the hill is reported for 1987 (ADelt 42 Chr, 92-6). Each comprised the building complex of a C country house built at the beginning of the 5th Ct as a round tower (8m diameter), developed during that century and destroyed toward the end. Walls had stone foundations (unworked except for door jambs) with mud-brick superstructure; a tiled roof was supported in places by piers. Functional activity is attested by mortars, loom weights and whorls as well as storage pithoi and hearths. That on the NE slope had evidence of an earlier phase while that on the SE of 4th Ct reoccupation. Varkiza. On Syrou a dump (from a drainage ditch dug by the Demos) produced Myc sherds. (ADelt 42 Chr, 96) Voula and Ano Voula. ADelt 42 Chr, 73-90 covers the 51 rescue excavations which took place that year, a document of devoted detailed work by the Archaeological Service which brought to light a few nice finds but is largely important for the ever growing information it gives of the layout of the deme and its surroundings. Two plots on Spetson (OT 147) and at Bas. Paulou 114 gave more evidence of the anc. road network already known. The former, though not in good condition, still showed wheelruts but the latter, though only a small section, was in excellent condition and gave much detailed evidence. A further nine sections of terrace walls are thought to be road terraces; of these that on Kastellorizou is called a country road. The greatest number of excavations (24) produced evidence of terracing or boundary walls, often continuing those already investigated or visibly continuing themselves into adjacent plots. One group of walls on Athenaidos surround a small rocky eminence; on Bas. Georgiou and Erakleidon (OT 121) the remains are dated to the 4th Ct BC and one bowl foot carries the letters AE. In contrast structural remains are reported from only 10 plots. A house of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC came to light at Achilleos 4 (OT 125), well-built on the rock with a good threshold and a bench (nearby a storage jar now full of snails). The less well-preserved remains at Niketara 22 (OT 118) must have been from a similar establishment whereas those on Arakdiou 11 (OT 130) are described as being from a C country house. Here domestic pottery and amphoras lay around the bench. At Gregoriou 5th (OT 158) the building lying W of the shrine (AR 131 (1992), 12), though disturbed, was found to continue, whereas on Meg. Basileiou (OT 251) a circular structure is reported of which most lies in the adjacent plot. The workshop previously found on OT 311 (AR 1992-93, 12) continued in the adjacent area and a small kiln </page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 13 was found dating to the 4th Ct BC. A well with stone parapet was cleared to a depth of 3m on 28th Street and a deposit of HL pottery (including stamped amphoras and Megarian bowls) came to light on Aidiniou and Poseidonos, where unauthorized sewerage work had taken place. This is of interest as pottery (even domestic) seems to be surprisingly rare in the area. Seven plots produced evidence of burials. In OT 116a on Kolokotrone there was a group of seven child graves of the mid-5th Ct, lying on the NW of the settlement away from the main cemetery area but almost certainly part of a larger group. Of a similar nature is another group of three children's graves in OT 150 on Spetseon, where there is also an adjacent funerary enclosure. A large group of tombs in the known Pegadakia area came to light in OT 271 on Kalymnou; these (three pyres and a child's lamax) belonged to the 2nd half of the 5th Ct. Among other finds was a faience jug. The other groups were all of similar type and date, except for 3rd Ct tombs at Eleutherias and Drosine where there was also a grave monument (these are not fully described). Vouliagmeni. ADelt 42 Chr, 96 reports a single rescue excavation which found two walls, one a terrace wall and the other at an angle to it; neither could be dated. ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, etc (2nd Ephorate and Kea) Aigina. Both in the town and at Chalikaki more 5th Ct graves came to light in 1987, cists in rows and ChTs with pit entrances. At the latter site there was also evidence of quarry- ing. (ADelt 42 Chr, 68) Kolonna. The purpose of the 1993 campaign by the Austrian Institute was the re-excavation of the PR settlement W of the temple of Apollo, which was partially excavated by G. Welter before World War II. The work was under the direction of Professors F. Felten and St. Hiller of the Univer- sity of Salzburg whose report is translated here: "There are no notes or relevant publications and the aim, therefore, was to excavate totally, in order to: 1) record and document existing walls, 2) establish the extent of G. Welter's excavations, 3) identify possible earlier building phases, 4) clarify the chronological link to existing architecture by stratigraphic exploration and to 5) stabilize and conserve endangered walls. Work concentrated on the area of the PR E-W road and included the excavation of four houses (VI-IX) N and W of the round structure. It was found that generally G. Welter's excavations were carried out over extended areas and taken down to the living rock. Some parts, however, remained unexcavated and these provided sufficient evidence for the chronological linking of all the remains of the town. They belong principally to one phase: the LMH. There were also traces of earlier phases, which give a terminus post quem for our buildings. The discovery of EH II house remains contain- ing diagnostic EH II vessels (sauceboats) in house VII proved relevant in this respect. In house VIII a bothros covered by a stone slab was found. It belongs to the lowest of several floor levels and contained a deposit of EH II pottery. In the W half of the same house the remains of another, earlier, building level were found. Remains of the SW corer of a structure, including a door to the S, came to light. Perhaps the house included a pottery kiln, which was surrounded by a thick layer of sherds, mostly the upper parts of painted amphoras belong- ing to the transition from EH III to MH. Such a phase has been almost absent in Aigina up to now. In addition, sherds of black polished pottery were found, including a perforated incense or perfume burner. The kiln, the floor belonging to it and the lower strata were conserved and covered, ready for future work. In house IX walls of earlier building phases were found. The N-E and S corers contained bothroi with much pottery, from which large parts of vessels could be out together. The pottery from the N-E bothros belongs to MBA and includes Cyc imports, the material from the S-E and S-W bothroi is transitional EBA-MBA and includes a proto-Minyan 'Bass- bowl' with traces of a potter's tourette."

Varvara on the Pyrgos site is a single-aisle vaulted basilica (9.40 x 3.90m) with exceptional masonry. Two layers of poorly preserved but fine quality wall-painting indicate a 13th Ct AD date. An impressive tower in the vicinity, as well as scattered building foundations indicate that the site served to control the island's E approaches.

Koukoules reports on his work in 1987 in ADelt 42 Chr, 119-21. The Prophites Elias site at an altitude of some 700m contained four large rectangular reservoirs in the centre of the small plateau, the largest being 7.50 x 2.70m with a greatest preserved height of 2m. Around these are many round cisterns, at least 2m deep. The existence of so many such structures may indicate the site's function as an important Byz settlement. Churches and other monuments were recorded and photographed. Nea 7.5.94 gives a full account of the important excavation of a Myc sanctuary at Ag. Konstantinos with many finds of terracotta figurines of rare types. The excavator, E. Consolake, also presented her finds at the Swedish conference on Pelopon- nesian sanctuaries in June. Salamis. In 1987 a LR tomb was found by the Church of Ag. Kyriake on Zoodochou Peges in an area where a Myc cemetery and another R tomb had been excavated previously. It was rock-cut and contained many bones in disarray but with two skeletons arranged tidily with four small clay oinochoai on top. (ADelt 42 Chr, 67)</page><page sequence="12">14 E.B. FRENCH K.

In 1987 two HL houses with roadway between (probably leading to the harbour) were excavated.

Williams II was focused upon the area immediately S of the present day site museum. He reports: "Two Frankish buildings flanking a gravelled court, all in use in the 13th Ct AD and destroyed by Catalan action in 1312 AD, were investigated this year. One of the two buildings, called unit 1 upon its discovery in 1990, defines the W side of the court. Unit 2 forms the NW corer and N side of the court. The main feature of unit 2 is its small, square church. Despite excavation for four years neither unit is as yet com- pletely cleared. During the 1993 season, it became clear that unit 1 is a complex built around its own central court, all the paving of which now has been exposed. One room at the SE corer room of the building was cleared this year; it follows the circulation pattern already known from the four rooms to its N. Access is through a door from the large court at the E, not from the paved central court of unit 1. This newly cleared room can be identified as a pharmacy because of the ceramic assemblage found with the architectural debris on its floor. The assemblage contains both locally made and imported albarella or drug pots, as well as other containers, but almost no table service shapes. One container of interest is a Mamluk jar without handles, light-on-dark, slip painted, a 13th Ct import from Egypt. In the SE corner of the paved court stands a manhole that apparently supplied the water to this whole unit. It is an alteration of a shaft that was originally designed as part of an earlier system, probably Gr in date. The manhole was used even after the Frankish period, the shaft being filled with what may be material of the 19th Ct, including agricultural imple- ments and a wooden shoe last. Immediately W of the manhole are the remains of a stairway that once gave access to the second floor of unit 1. To judge from the especially heavy walls that define the rooms that line the W side of the paved court, one can assume that the second-storey plan was limited to that side of the unit. A room on the N side of the paved court, only partially exposed in 1992, can now be identified positively as a kitchen, not only because of the large hearth that is built against its N wall, but because of the amount of cooking pots found on the ash-covered floor throughout the room. A small kitchen, with built hearth and terracotta floor paving, was found underlying the W end of the Frankish kitchen. This appears to be part of the remains of an early Frankish building that underlies the W half of unit 1. The continued excavation of unit 2 this year produced less information about the architecture of the structure than it did about the ceramics of the end of the 13th Ct that were used within the complex. The vast majority of the pottery can be associated with the clean-up of unit 2 after the destruction of 1312 AD. Since unit 2 has a church built within its limits, with access to rooms of the unit directly from the church, it has been posited that the complex is a monastery or convent. The pottery found dumped into one room of this unit is considered to have been used by its occupants; this may well explain the large concentration of small bowls in the dump, many of which seem to come in pairs. A large percentage of the glazed pottery from the clean-up is imported, with both Venetian and S Italian Protomaiolica bowls being very popular. Archaic Maiolica, also from Italy, is slightly less popular. A number of fabrics that are not yet identified by place of manufacture exist among the table wares. Metallic ware, not usually found in Corinth in the form of small bowls, is represented, as usual, in the form of table pitchers. From this deposit comes only one faience albarello, imported from the Near East. No Egyptian imports have been identified in this assemblage. An interesting comparison between the stratigraphy of the two units is that very little evidence exists for the rebuilding of unit 1 after the destruction of 1312. Evidence of various squatter reuses does exist there, but they are minimal in quality and effort and seem not to follow immediately after the destruction. Unit 2 shows signs of having been more exten- sively repaired, but again not immediately after the Catalan destruction. Its reconstruction appears to consist of an effort to rebuild according to the original design of the unit. In both cases reoccupation after 1312 AD seems to come in the last third of the 14th Ct, perhaps as a result of Acciajuoli control of Corinth and the Florentine family's efforts to produce stability in the area." Isthmia. The primary focus in 1993 of the Ohio State Univer- sity expedition under T. Gregory (ASCS) was the continued conservation of the monochrome mosaic in the R bath, discovered in 1976 and lifted in 1990; he reports: "Relaying of the mosaic began in 1992 and 21 of a total of 148 sections were put back in their original places. Work this year proceeded rapidly and a total of 48 sections was relaid, bringing the total in two seasons to 69 sections, and allowing us to reach the middle of the mosaic. A particulary time- consuming aspect of this conservation is the relaying of a single line of tesserae between the sections; the new hardened mortar has to be chiselled out, the tesserae properly selected and often cut to size, and these then carefully set in a line that completely conceals the join between restored sections. Conservation work proceeded rapidly this year and we hope that the task of relaying the whole mosaic may be completed during the 1994 season.</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 15 Further fieldwork was carried out in the area of the R bath, where we cleaned out several trenches excavated in previous years. Most notable was trench GB located just N of the N wall of the bath. This trench had been excavated to a depth of over 4m below the mod. ground level and it exposed a sequence of collapses that are clearly visible in its W scarp. This scarp was carefully photographed and drawn and material from the 1970 excavation was examined to provide chronologi- cal information. At the top of the scarp was a large collapse, involving large blocks, that sloped down gradually from S to N; this collapse is dated by pottery of the 7th Ct AD and seems to represent a significant abandonment of the Hexa- milion fortification at that time. Below this upper collapse was a hard-packed level that appears to represent ground-level at the time the Hexamilion was constructed in the early years of the 5th Ct. Below this was another series of sloping fills that included enormous quantities of marble chips and mosaic tesserae and debitage; the tesserae were similar to those found in the mosaics on the floors of the R bath. Surprisingly, however, this material was found in a context dated by pottery that may be assigned to the middle and latter years of the 3rd Ct AD. On the basis of the slope of these fills, this material must have been thrown from the top of the N wall of the bath, suggesting that the roof of the building must have been removed (and presumably repaired) at that time. This provides an interesting and otherwise undocumented event in the history of the R bath. At the bottom of these sloping fills is another horizontal level, dating to the middle of the 2nd Ct and representing ground-level at the time the R bath was con- structed. Finally, below this level were two E-W walls, roughly parallel to the N wall of the R bath. One of these (the N) was apparently standing at the time the bath was con- structed, although it had been dismantled by the time the 3rd Ct fills were deposited. The S wall, by contrast, had no connection with the R bath and its foundations had already been covered by soil at the time the bath was built. There is presently no evidence about the building to which this latter wall belonged although it is tempting to suggest that it could have been part of the Gr period bathing establishment, whose remains are visible further to the S. Investigation this year was begun in the area of the so- called E Field, located E of the Temple of Poseidon and W of the Byz Fortress. This area had been excavated between 1970 and 1972 by Paul Clement but he had been unable to prepare a final report on those excavations. We therefore began a programme to study all the architectural features and context material (pottery and other finds) from this area. The E Field contains a veritable maze of walls of poor quality, clearly representing more than one period of construction. These walls seem to be from small buildings (houses or other small establishments) with facilities for water and the preparation of food. The earliest of the walls seem to date from the 2nd Ct AD, although most of the ceramic material appears to date from the 3rd and later. In all, there are objects from over 700 individual stratigraphic units in approximately 30 trenches. Of these we were able to examine and analyze approximately one third this season. It is premature to speculate about the purpose and history of this fascinating area, although research in subsequent years will surely lead to important conclusions." E. Gebhard (ASCS) reports on the University of Chicago work on the site which in 1993 was confined to study. The following points may be noted: "On the Rachi settlement study of the working floors and adjacent cuttings, as well as associated stone weights in comparison with similar installations elsewhere, makes it likely Fig. 6 that the workshops were used to produce olive oil. The blocks of the cella wall of the A temple were photo- graphed and then arranged for permanent display at the N edge of the temenos. Study continued of the stone chips coming from the fluting of the C temple shafts. Tool marks show that, before being erected, each column drum was given a smooth surface, probably on a lathe. The drum was then marked with a notation indicating its place in the colonnade. The use of such notations more commonly found on buildings where the blocks were dismantled and then rebuilt, points to a phase in the construction when all the drums were cut at one time rather than being individually finished at the site as they were put in place." Nemea. Work in 1993 by S.G. Miller (ASCS) was concen- trated on preparation of the stadium for publication and for visitors. He reports (inter alia): "Perhaps the most interesting work of the summer came as a co-operative effort with P. Valavanis of the University of Athens. With the support and help of the Nauplion Ephorate, and acting upon Valvanis' theoretical reconstruction of the hysplex starting mechanism for the stadium, we were able to make a working model of that machine set into the stone bases at the starting line at the S end of the stadium. Wooden frames set into those bases held the rope torsion springs that supplied the force necessary to throw the barriers to the ground (Fig. 6), thereby providing the athletes with a simultaneous start. Tests made with students from the Nemea high school and from a California high school (Fig. 7) showed that the model worked flawlessly and suggest that knowledge of the workings of the hysplex mechanism, lost for centuries, has been recovered."

The main target for the year was the well-preserved and well-known bastion (which has hitherto been designated a 'Tower') with its connecting curtains. The field data is now being processed on computer to produce a three-dimensional representation of the area of the bastion including the surrounding landscape. After this year's work the acropolis of Asine has taken on quite a different layout from that we are wont to imagine. Cuttings in bedrock reveal that there were in anc. times huge terraces, of which the so-called Crown Prince's Tower is one, that extended the habitable, and even cultivatable, area and that these terraces formed part of the HL fortification system together with regular curtain walls." Epidauros: Sanctuary of Apollo Maleatis (AR 1992-93, 16- 17). B. Lambrinoudakis publishes a full report on his work in 1990 in PAE 45-9 and on his work in 1993 in Ergon 10-20 which was largely dedicated to the study of the arrangements for water usage on the site where water played an important part in the ceremonies. The rest of the orthostats on the Skana were restored; in area P at the NE comer there was a sort of tower and a stair leading from Corridor T to room A and up to room Y on the higher level was cleared. The drain of the Antonine cistern (incorporated into the front of the skana) was cleared and found to run beneath the propylon of the sanctuary, then falling into an underground water channel which probably leads down into the large water channel of the Asclepieion. Methods of inspection and regulation were noted. Water from the roof of the stoa (by the propylon) ran into a catchment and ran from there into the underground water channel; water was also retained by the entrance for use at this point. Another water channel was indentified by the R propylon at the angle with the skana at the NE corer of the court of the sanctuary; it again drops sharply into the underground water channel and presumably served to collect the water from the court and from the skana roof. Another small drain ran under the propylon carrying dirty water from the sanctuary of the Egyptian gods and the baths of the skana; it ran out into the open. Deep under the R propylon was a big C water channel running in a natural cleft with its N end by the outer line of the great terrace. Its existing length agrees with the building inscription at 147 feet. It starts behind the temenos of the Muses but was damaged in R times. The purpose of this drain seems to have been to collect water from the drop by the hill and not that from the court. The existence of a streambed in the area occupied in R times by the Nymphaion is shown by the presence at a depth of about 1.6m of a poros terrace wall of C date enclosing the hill and preventing erosion. This water was later diverted to the bath complex in a long channel.

(Kyriakat- ikos Rizospastes 24.10.93) Mycenae (AR 1992-93, 18). E.B. French (BSA) reports: "The third season of the Mycenae Survey conducted under the aegis of Professor Sp. Iakovides and the Archaeological Society (see also Ergon 10) took place in 1993. We were extremely fortunate to be able to have the same experienced team as in 1992 and the excellent results are largely due to their hard work and competence. The major aim of the season had been to survey the area S of the main road from Phychtia to the site as far as the known areas of Chania (at the W) and Plesia (at the E). This was successfully accomplished; 141 further entries were made in the data base. The W side of the area is now heavily cultivated and most of the antiquities noted by Steffen have disappeared. The E in contrast is untouched and many new features were noted. The most important was a ChT cemetery at Plesia which, though Steffen had recorded one tomb as a Hohle, had not been identified. There are at least 20 tombs here cut into a cliff face adjacent to one of the anc. clay beds. The importance of the survey is continually being illustrated as damage is caused to the scattered remains both wilfully and accidentally in two specific instances during the season. By the end of the season all the actual field work had been completed and the first checks carried out; a large part of the data has also been indexed." Nauplion.

In 1993 excavations of the Austrian Institute under V. Mitsopoulou-Leon were concentrated in the residential area of 'Phoumoi', in particular of the N house on the lower terrace. She reports: "N of the bathroom which was excavated last year lies a smaller room containing three pithoi by the E wall. Their bottoms are preserved in situ; wall fragments lay face-down next to them, one still with a lead clamp used for repair (Fig. 8). In front of the N pithos lay a kitchen amphora. It is interesting that the S pithos sits on the socle of the wall which once formed the N limit of the bathroom, showing that the N wall was demolished when the W wall and the W part of the bathroom floor were removed and the bathtub and basin lopped off. During a general remodelling the bathroom was moved, probably to a small room E of the andron. In a second phase it was made smaller and turned into a multi-purpose bath- and workroom. The original bathroom was later linked with the storeroom. The majority of finds here date from the LHL to the ER period. N of the room with the hearth which was exca- vated two years ago lies another 'wet' room with two basins. The E half is paved with terracotta fragments set in mortar, similar to the floor in the andron and the bath/workroom connected with it. As mentioned previously, a small basin, built of broken bricks and mortar, is set against the E wall. The W part of the room contains a larger basin. The floor here consists of terracotta fragments set vertically into mortar, similar to the bathroom, but the design is less regular. Just below the top of the W wall runs a gutter built of pieces of Laconian tiles, which is linked to a collecting basin in front of the wall. The finds are slightly different from those of the andron, where surprisingly the majority are cooking pots. Here a link with certain crafts and the economy is noticeable. W of the 'wet' room and N of the storage area lies another room whose W limit has not yet been clarified. Under the layer of roof tiles lying on a floor of compacted clay 27 bronze studs were found, which once decorated the leaf of a wooden door. The door is not preserved. It lay parallel to the N wall and presumably belongs to the same building phase. There are clear indications that the door did not fall, but had been put on the floor, perhaps to be worked on (fixing the mountings?) or because of the rebuilding work. Three types of studs (conical, shield- shaped and pointed) were arranged in three double rows in such a way, that the area with the greatest distance between two double rows lies to the E. Well-known parallels show that this is the lower part of the door. The vertical row of studs on the inner edge lies on the N side. Minimum height of the door is 2.53, its width 0.51m. In the W part of the room nine coins from the time of Hadrian to Severus were found trodden into the clay floor. They are linked with the later walls, which were built above the layer of roof tiles. The ancient main roads in the area of Lousoi: During an extensive survey undertaken by K. Tausend, University of Graz to find the anc. main roads into the basin of Lousoi, the established routes from Lousoi to Kalavryta, Ano Klitoria, Solos and Pheneos were investigated. Remains of anc. roads and traces of their use were found at the following locations: road to Kalavryta: retaining walls and paving immediately N Fig. 8 of the pass over Velia (1) and near a place called Primisi (2); road to Solos: remains of a road (retaining walls) in the area of Mavrolongos (3) and on the Xerokampo (4) with traces of wheeled traffic at one point and an artificially widened passage through the rock (5) in the pass at a location called Psilostav- ros; road to Klitoria: foundations of an anc. well surround (?)

In collaboration with the Ephorate under the direction of Prof. Dr. H. Lauter (Marburg) excavations and cleaning operations have taken place since 1991. He reports: "It is well known that the first excavations were carried out by an English team in 1890-92. Re-measuring began in 1941 under P. Knoblauch but remained unfinished. In recent years, the aim has been re-excavation and re-planning in the Sanctu- ary of Zeus Soter. Pottery studies date the complex to 330-340 BC. During the campaign of 1993 the altar was cleared and it was possible to show that the S side of the sanctuary, although largely swept away by the river Helisson, must have had a double colonnade. In 1993 excavations were extended to the Philippeion Stoa. The W exedra was completely cleared. The most important discovery was a stone foundation on the N long side (Fig. 9) which could have carried the base for a statue. During building operations the foundation slabs were probably set into the existing underfill (the pottery in the foundation pit and the lower fill is almost identical). It seems likely that a statue was dedicated here to the Royal Macedonian family when the hall was consecrated to Philipp II (Paus. VIII 30, 6). On the lower back wall of the W exedra remains of wall plaster were preserved, showing vertical incised lines which follow the 17</page><page sequence="16">18 E.B. FRENCH Fig. 9 joints of the orthostats. Directly behind the building is an open area with a pavement of terracotta tiles. The E exedra was also completely cleared. There never was a foundation here and, therefore, no statue base." Tegea. The 4th season of the excavation program conducted in the sanctuary of Athena Alea at Tegea by the Norwegian Institute and others took place in 1993. The campaign was directed by Dr. E. Ostby who reports: "Two teams continued their work in the lower part of the sector N of the temple, in layers under the surface of the L- and post- C periods. The fill under this surface contains interesting material discarded from votive deposits of the 8th- 7th Ct, with several fine bronze objects (a phiale, a large pomegranate pendant, sheets, disks, pins, rings etc.), a fine Daedalic female figurine of lead, and cut-out figures of lead sheets similar to those from the Artemis Orthia sanctuary at Sparta. Under this fill two successive layers, probably of the 5th-6th Ct, but with scarce material, are defined by their surfaces with rich inclusions of white pebbles. Various groups of post-holes in the lower surface give evidence for very simple structures (huts, or possibly just fenced areas). A fragmentary, curved rubble wall emerging in the same layer probably belongs to an earlier structure of the 7th Ct. In the N part of this area, close to the mod. road, a new team has been set up. Under the post-C surface, which slopes downward from the temple and had only a thin fill underneath in this sector, extensive remains of a large A mud-brick structure have been identified. It has not yet been possible to establish its shape or function. The team working in the temple opened a new trench in the E end of the C cella in order to identify the fronts of the two G cult buildings. The pronaos of the later, larger building was discovered in this trench, framed to the N and S by clay walls emerging beneath the A colonnade foundations and supported from the inside by wooden posts which have left holes in the ground. Similar posts were probably also set in the open front of the pronaos between the antae; the N anta is preserved, and its front was covered by a wooden plank. The total length of the building can now be calculated between 12 and 13m, with an external width slightly above 4m. The dividing wall between the pronaos and the interior of the building has not yet been excavated. Two, perhaps three successive floor levels have been identified in the pronaos, suggesting that the building remained in use for a fairly long period; a PCor aryballos dated about 680-70, found in one of the post-holes, indicates that it had by that time recently been destroyed or dismantled. Other finds consist mostly of LG, decorated sherds and small votive gifts, but include some important, EO ojects (a faience scarab, a figure in bone of a reclining ram). There is evidence in the trench walls for a transverse cutting across the pronaos, at a level between the clay walls of the G buildings and the foundations for the A colonnades; this may be an indication of a 7th Ct building, covering the chronologi- cal gap between the two structures. A couple of enigmatical terracotta objects may perhaps be understood as traces of its roof decoration. In the pronaos area of the C temple, investiga- tions of the group of metal-working pits identified in 1992 continued (Fig. 10). The large and intricate complex of clay- lined pits filled with burnt clay, ashes and slag was used for production of iron and bronze; sherds and other objects are of the same period as those found in the G buildings. A catalogue of the building material from the C temple now scattered at the site is being prepared; it totals 818 blocks. Among those few blocks which cannot be connected with the temple, a block certainly from the starting line of the stadion mentioned by Pausanias has been identified; some fragments of water basins and channels are probably traces of the same structure."

Stainchaouer publishes yet more fragments from this province of both the Latin and Greek texts of Diocletian's edict in AE 131 (1992) 163-77. The first field season of the Laconia Rural Sites Project took place in 1993 under the direction of W. Cavanagh and C. Mee (BSA). They report: "The project has developed out of the Laconia Survey and aims to investigate a diachronic range of single-period rural sites in order to ascertain their form and function by means of prospection and soil studies. Twenty sites were selected for intensive treatment, of which twelve were examined this year with a time range of EH II to Byz. A grid of 5m x 5m squares was laid out on each site. Tally counts of artifacts were recorded over the whole of the site and its periphery. Then all of the artifacts in each square were collected. Tile was sorted into categories by glaze and thickness, weighed and discarded on site. Sherds and small finds were brought back and processed. The data have been input into the project database. The geophysical investigation of the sites was undertaken with a Geoscan FM36 Fluxgate Gradiometer and a Geoscan RM15 Resistance Meter using a twin probe array. Although problems were encountered, principally because of soil conditions and temperature variations, indications of features are apparent on six of the sites and further analysis may reveal more. Soil samples were taken at fixed intervals over the site grid and also, for comparative purposes, off-site. The aim is to test soil chemical and mineral magnetic characteristics as indicators of past human activity. Soil properties to be analysed include phosphorus, a range of metallic elements, and magnetic susceptibility. Particle-size, percent organic carbon, calcium carbonate and iron oxides will also be determined. It is through the combination of these different approaches to the surface record and their interpretation by appropriate experts that we hope to gain a better understanding of these small rural sites, so frequently encountered in field surveys in Greece yet still poorly understood."

The presence of burials of 6,000 years ago is highlighted by Emeresia 4.12.93 in an article previewing the important report presented by the excavator, Dr G. Papa- thanassopoulos, at the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art. Kalamakia Cave (Areopolis, Mani). The French School in cooperation with the University of Athens and the Ephorate of Speleology began work in 1993 under the direction of H. de Lumley and A. Darla. The first stage of the work entailed recording of the cave and the area outside before intervention by photograph and video. A grid was then established and the safety of the walls assured. There then followed the removal of the surface stone and loose soil and the study of the deposition history as it could be observed. All material removed was sieved. Finally the cave was planned in detail and sections drawn. Samples of all soils were taken for analysis. The excavations commenced across the whole width of the cave to a distance of 4m from the entrance; work was entirely horizon- tal in 2-3cm spits. All finds were recorded three-dimensionally using the grid. Excavated earth was put through a 5mm and a Fig. 11 2mm dry sieve. The uppermost deposits were barren, or contained only the scantiest remains, but a lower level pro- duced a stone feature (not yet cleared to its full depth or interpreted) and a hearth, from which carbon will be tested for dating as the stone tools (primarily of quartz but also flint and local stone) are atypical. Some animal bone was also retrieved. Monemvasia. The survey of the upper city was continued by a group of 10 surveyors from the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Manchester led by Dr. David Hill (BSA). He reports: "The survey is designed to assist the long-term research on the city by Dr. Haris Kalligas and is under her overall direction and in cooperation with the 5th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities at Sparta represented by A. Andvakidiki. The survey is within the control points and level stations set out in 1991 and has concentrated on the areas laid down by Haris Kalligas and these are, in essence, the sector of the town from the gateway to the upper cistern known as the 'Galera'. This forms a solid section of work. Within this area, which is often difficult of access because of the density of thorn bushes, a mass of detail still has to be recorded. The sites have to be cleared of vegetation by local workmen, and the covering of rubble on some monuments still makes useful recording of large areas difficult. The clearance this year ran along the walls to the far western bastion on the S side of the city and included the bastion around the Kretikos House that commands the gates into the lower town. The detailed plan of the town walls includes the area from the gateway into the upper city to the bastion by the Kretikos house. The exterior of the walls cannot be surveyed in the usual manner because of the sheer drop to the lower town and a photographic record has been made. A cantilevered support is used so that the camera is outside the walls and looking back on them. High quality photographs have been taken of all the upper town walls, to the N of the city as well as to the S and this photographic survey should enable the architects to 19</page><page sequence="18">20 E.B. FRENCH evaluate the state of preservation of the walls and to begin the task of recognising the many phases of development and repair that these walls show. The only water available to the town was rainwater and the number of cistern structures on the upper town is enormous. Because of their subterranean nature, these are often well preserved. They are of two types, the small 'private' cisterns and a set of three large, 'civic' structures which may well have been original 9th Ct features in their earliest phase. These three upper city cisterns may well reveal aspects of the organisation of the town. The 'Galera' cistern was investigated last year and this year the survey of the 'Gallezza' cistern has now been completed. This leaves the large 'Bastada' cistern to be surveyed. It is within our survey area but it is full of water and has no side entrance. A new method using the caving techniques of one of our members will have to be devised. The house of Kretikos is a complex structure with several major phases and was surveyed in detail this season, its use included being a powder magazine as well as, later, the house of a merchant." Nea 8.3.94 describes the sorry state of the walls. Plitra. The underwater looting of this site is reported in Typos tes Kyriakes 6.6.94. Sparta. A further programme of survey and excavation was carried out on the site of the anc. theatre at Sparta by Profs. G.B. Waywell and J.J. Wilkes (BSA); they report: "The project was a continuation of that begun in 1992, the purpose of which was to clarify details of the structure partly revealed in the British School at Athens' excavations of 1906-9 and 1924-28. Following three weeks of stone removal and recording in April, a six-week campaign of excavation was carried out in July and August. Further digging was under- taken in three of the six trenches commenced in 1992 and four new trenches were opened up in the higher auditorium. Continued excavation of the W part of the orchestra and lower cavea revealed that the front row of seats and the walkway behind them were in position between staircases II and III, but the rows of seats above had been completely removed, perhaps to provide material for a defensive tower that may have been built within the angle of the LR wall nearby. Clearance of silt from the perimeter drain between stair- cases I and III yielded pottery of 4th-5th Ct AD date, as well as two marble sculptures: a LR male portrait head (Cover), and a herm-shaft from a series that seems to have stood at the ends of the front row of seats next to the staircases. Other sculp- tures retrieved from Med walls were a late Antonine female portrait head and a small torso of Eros, probably of Hadrianic date. The destruction level of the antique theatre was marked by a yellow clay layer, probably of 6th Ct AD date. Above this was a deep stratum of green clay and silt, encountered in the 1992 sounding, which contained substantial amounts of 9th Ct pottery. This level was in turn sealed by a destruction deposit with charred timbers and collapsed mud-brick from a first phase of Med dwellings probably also of the 9th Ct. Over this lay the two later phases of more substantial stone-built structures encountered in 1992. Pottery and associated coins suggested a Mid 10th Ct terminus ante quem for the earlier of these. On the upper E cavea the trenches were linked by a new 2m wide extension which completed the section from the diazoma to the outer retaining wall. Fresh excavation revealed the foundation blocks for staircase VIII and the four highest rows of seats below the diazoma, while in the other trench further investigation of the deep mud-brick layers proved that these were contemporary with the mortared rubble foundations both of the cavea back wall and of the inner radial wall. Pottery recovered from the mud-brick confirmed a construction date in the late 1st Ct BC. A new trench located over upper staircase V, re-examined evidence for the highest surviving seat blocks reported by Woodward in 1924. Upper rows 17-19 were found to be in position on mortared rubble foundations supported by the inner radial wall, the face of which was discovered just below row 17. A worn setting for a column shaft on block 19 suggested this may once have helped support a colonnade of Doric columns around the top of the theatre, covering a walkway ca 4.80m wide. If so the upper cavea would have contained 18 rows of usable seats. The inner radial wall was found to continue, but no trace even of its foundations survived near the top of staircase II." ACHAIA (6th Ephorate) In the course of topographic work in conjunction with KERA on the Achaean Dodecapolis, anc. sites of the territory of Dyme were noted at Ae-Lia Petrochoriou, Bourdanaiika Elaiochoriou, Kosmoula Arlas, Anemomylos and Phengoula Phloka. (ADelt 42 Chr, 164) The presence in the Mitsotakes collection of two Myc pots from illicit excavation in the area is reported in Nea 24.1.94. Aigeira. The excavations of the Austrian Institute under Professor A. Bammer continued in 1993; he reports: "Work was carried out in the following areas: excavation in the area of the Zeus Sanctuary; excavation in 'cave I'; surface and geodetic surveys in the area of the so-called agora. N of the theatre, or rather the naiskoi D and E, several test trenches were dug, parallel and perpendicular to the retaining walls built by farmers. Some anc. foundations were built into these mod. walls and remained in situ. The greater part of the area, particularly E of the Grapepickers' House III, was built up in antiquity. In two test trenches foundations and walls of local conglomerate belonging to a HL structure came to light. Pebble mosaics and the foundations of two buttresses were found inside. The building lies within the Hippodamian grid system of the town, as do the naiskoi D, E and F. In two further soundings E of the HL building, which may have had a public or religious function, a foundation of regular, well- dressed blocks was found, which also lay within the grid system. Colour changes in the soil of the soundings gave evidence for a later wooden structure. E of the foundation and parallel to it runs a terracotta water conduit. Since fragments of small marble sculptures were found close to the buildings, the latter were possibly of public character and part of the town-planning concept which includes the theatre and the area around the sanctuary. Soundings on the extended N axis of the theatre produced no archaeological traces at all, not even the surface of a town square. The 1991 sounding in front of the so- called 'cave I', which may have been a cave of Zeus, if one accepts that Pausanias' Temple of Zeus was located in this large area, was deepened. Below the fill, which is over lm thick and stems from the houses on the slope above, a narrow, curved wall came to light, evidently a wind-break for a hearth. This was confirmed by the large amount of ashes around it. The so-called agora was surveyed for the first time. Three gates with piers partially preserved in situ were identified, as well as a number of walls and retaining walls, which for the first time give an indication of the limits of this important inner-city area."</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 Aigion. Rescue excavation in 1987 on eight plots in the city and two in the surrounding area is reported. (ADelt 42 Chr, 151-4) An important LHL complex of at least three rooms in two building phases was excavated at Bas. Konstantinou 75A and Panagiotopoulou; in the earlier phases walls incorporating layers of tiles resting directly on virgin soil without foundations probably indicate a one-storey structure. Much pottery was found (including bg and Pergamine) as well as loomweights, a bone spoon, mortars and a figurine. The second phase probably continued into the 1st Ct AD. Occupation of the 3rd/4th Cts AD was also noted. Another HL house at Bas. Konstantinou and Elikes 33, with typical finds, was of import- ance for its close sequential building phases. An unusual structure is reported from Panagiotopoulou 9 and Chil. Oreinou 16: a square of brick and mortar, roofed with a single slab of stone from Astakos and containing a small internal stairway. At Sphokleous 8, a HL built cist tomb was found constructed within an already built but unroofed house. It contained six pots, a strigil, two bronzes, two gold rosettes and a sheet of gold leaf inscribed AEEIAAOC MYCTAC; another burial produced a similar sheet inscribed OIAQN MYCTAC. At Korinthou 18 the plot contained a structure of two phases, both using tile but the latter containing spolia also. Three burials were cut into the walls: a child in a vessel, a child in a pit, and an adult on earth covered with tiles; no dating is given. A HL pithos burial with another vase in the neck came to light at Kolokotrone 10 and at Monodentriou 31 a simple burial surrounded by tiles on edge, of the 4th Ct BC, was found. Drosato Brysariou. At Lakes or Potami an extensive settle- ment with much pottery dating from the 8th to the 1st Ct BC was noted. (ADelt 42 Chr, 164) Elike. D. Katsonopoulou (ASCS) reports on the recent work in the search for this anc. site. "In 1991 we drilled five bore holes in the coastal plain between the Selinus and Kerynites rivers. We obtained organic samples from the sediment cores for C14 dating which suggested that the C horizon is less than 12m deep in this area. In 1993 we drilled 17 additional bore holes between Temeni and Nikolaiika with a minimum depth of 10m and a maximum of 25m. In five of these holes we found fragments and traces of pottery, mostly between 3 and 7m deep. In three holes at the same depth interval we found carbonized seeds and stems of grape vines. We believe this material indicates anc. occupation in an area extending over more than 1km, but we must emphasize that the evidence does not constitute the discovery or identification of anc. Elike." This work is reported in the press also, e.g. Nea 30.7.93 and a long feature article in Typos tes Kyriakes 10.4.94. Glastra. In 1987 the workmen of the Electricity Company, while digging the foundations for a pylon, found a HL-?R cist grave with C roof tiles as cover, containing 10 skeletons in layers. The few finds consisted of two pairs of bronze earrings (one simple, one elaborate) and part of a bronze ornament. (ADelt 42 Chr, 163-4) Kalentzi: Ag. Marina (anc. Tritaia). Money was raised through the local authorities to start serious excavation at this site; tests were made in 1986 and in 1987 full clearance of areas to the NW and S of the Panagia Church was undertaken. To the NW (area A) three rooms of a public building were brought to light, one with a slab floor, and in the others slab cists without offerings were found. The walls contain spolia and are probably LR in date, but ER material was found and also evidence of building in the 3rd Ct BC. In area B to the S walls, a storage pithos and a hearth can be assigned to the 3rd/2nd Ct BC with additions in ER. Other finds included a grave stone inscribed EEN XAIPE, a HL and a R capital. The building styles of the various periods are quite distinct. (ADelt 42 Chr, 160-3) A stele inscribed QZION OPAZYBOYAOY XAIPE and a R coin were handed in to the Museum.

Five new ChTs were cleared to the N and W of the tholos. The roof had collapsed in all but one (XIII) which was thus partially robbed. T X, the largest, had been cleared out, perhaps for use, and contained no burials or offerings. Tombs XI and XII were both small; XI had seven burials in two layers with many finds, but a slab-covered pit in the dromos was empty; XII contained only two pots, but it is possible that some of those found in XI belonged here originally as the two communicated. T XIV was again in two layers and had a pit also; it contained 23 pots and many finds. The total of last year's work was 27 burials, dating from LH IIIA to IIIC. Karabostasi Araxou: Ag. Nikolaou. The fortified acropolis was cleaned of vegetation and the line of the walls followed at two points. Publication of the acropolis is planned. (ADelt 42 Chr, 164) Kato Achaia (anc. Dyme). The Ephorate reports on 14 rescue excavations during 1987 though, as the pottery and finds have not yet been fully studied, some details must await full publication. (ADelt 42 Chr, 154-60) Most plots of interest lay in the SE section of the town and the evidence recovered concerns the HL/ER period. On Philopoimenos three phases were distinguished, with a lamp of the end of the 2nd Ct/2nd quarter of the 1st Ct BC giving the division between the upper two building phases (roadway and structures); the lowest level of EHL produced sherds but no architecture. Finds included an Ionic base by the road, pilasters and a grave stele with palmette inscribed KPAT. Three similar phases were noted on Parodos Pausaniou, with a slight change of alignment of walls in the latest phase (mid 2nd Ct BC). From Pausaniou and Philopoimenos came much architecture of M and LHL and pottery of EHL as well; a hoard of 800 silver coins of the 2nd Ct BC came from an adjacent plot, with mints of the League and other areas. It is suggested that a public building or sanctuary must have existed in this area. At Aratou and Philiopoimenos sewerage work brought to light a further 51 silver coins of the League, dated to 200-150 BC. Some evidence for roads was found by sewerage work in the Plateia Demokratias and at Diakou 46; in the latter plot later (LR) tombs had been cut into the road, destroying it. Klaus. Th. Papadopoulos publishes the results of his 1990 work in PAE 50-5. Kleitoria (anc. Kleitor).

A small fortified acropolis was identified at this site. (ADelt 42 Chr, 164) Kruoneri. The making of a private tractor route brought to light in 1987 a C pithos burial and a contemporary cinerary vessel with a kotyle as offering.

(AR 1992-93, 23) Excavations in 1987 found evidence for the hypocaust and ancillary rooms of the R bath N-W of the MByz basilica. The excavators report this to be a settlement unknown until now, with continuous use from R to postByz times. (ADelt 42 Chr, 194) Patras. In 1987 the Ephorate carried out excavation in 190 plots, in 68 of which antiquities were found; these are reported in ADelt 42 Chr, 137-151. Much of the evidence recovered serves only to complement the information already known about the layout and social structure of the city, and indeed comes from plots adjacent to those already investigated. Particularly important however is the first evidence of Myc settlement at Pagonas 41 (between the Aroe hill and that with the Old People's Home) and nearby at Chrysobitiou 9. On the former plot, well-preserved structures with two building phases came to light, with an open area (with hearth and a child grave) between them. Destruction was caused by a landslide; finds included much excellent pottery and small objects. Detailed special publication is promised. Six plots produced evidence of HL occupation, but little of interest survives R disturbance; at Korinthou 429 there was evidence of a road- way, but it could not be investigated because of danger from the adjacent building. Parts of R public buildings were uncovered in three plots. At Ephaistou 53-5 expropriation enabled further investigation: the stoas previously excavated were cleared again and two more to the S explored; this site is adjacent to the R hippodrome (previously thought to be an amphitheatre). At Panachaidos Athenas 8 and Boukaoure (by the E gate of the Kastro) and in adjacent plots, though at great depth, a R complex and roadway were cleared to which there had been many changes in LR times. Particularly notable are a mosaic with geometric designs and a male figure (?god) and many finds of good sculptural fragments. At Bas. Rouphou 49- 53 three rooms of a public building with mosaic and marbled floors were cleared. The differing elaborate techniques used in the walling are noted. Destruction was by earthquake, followed by fire. Other good R occupation levels were found in seven plots and in 15 others there was scrappy evidence of a similar kind. Further evidence for gardens in open courts, surrounded by stoas with columns or brick pillars, may be noted at Aktes Dymaion 7, in the parados by Ag. Demetriou and Botsare and at Tsamadou and Io. Blachou. Parts of the known road system were found in four plots in one instance (on Pangabe) with four tile graves beside it. At G Rouphou 88-90, where a long sequence of occupation from HL to Ott was found, the main feature of the R levels was a bath complex with a clean- ing/fuelling shaft for the hypocaust, a marble calderium and other small subsidiary rooms. From Eleias 60, again only part of long occupation, an intriguing R complex is briefly described with a bath (?or settling tank), drain, cistern, kiln and a water channel with sump. Definite workshop evidence of the R period is reported from Danielidos 4 (small kiln) and at Gounari 157 (storage pithos, cistern et al.). A smaller number (11) of LR remains (the use of tile seems to be the local dating criterion) are reported; most are scrappy and the latest of poor masonry. Two (at Mesatidos 11 and G. Phratze 72) are considered workshops, the latter for wine production. Sporadic LByz remains were noted on two sites and at Daniklidos 10, full excavation of the later levels by the Byzantine Ephorate is noted. At Kleanthe-Exo Aguia the walls of a country house of the LR-Byz period came to light with both domestic and glazed pottery. The find of a handsome stretch of Ott kalderimi running N-S, making a corer with an earlier section and with central drain, occured on the Gounari 157 plot. Further finds were made in both the SW (five areas) and SE (four areas) cemeteries. Notable are: from Benizelou Rouphou 9, a wooden box (35 x 40cms) with iron nails at the corers containing two clay birds, three glass tear bottles, four spheri- cal glass vessels, three small lead rattles and the clay figure of a pregnant woman (all called toys); from Ag. Saranta 6-8 the unusual T V with internal niches like a columbarium; from Char. Trikoupe 32-6 a EHL cist grave covered with layers of tiles and of offerings; from Kalabryton and N. Giannopoulou a lamp of the 2nd/3rd Ct AD with an interesting representation and an inscription Cno(CI)ANO. As reported the SE cemetery seems to be less rich. From the S cemetery, at Koumaniote 22, some LR tomb chambers were tested but the remains lie deep apparently on an embankment of some kind; an adjacaent pebble passage is interpreted as a corridor rather than a roadway. At Kephallenias and Thermopylon a tomb chamber from the N cemetery with three niches for urns was in use from EHL to LR. The presence of Ch burials in areas used for settlement in LR times may be noted. In addition it is reported that cleaning in the bed of the Xylokera river brought to light rooms of a HL structure with storage pithoi. (ADelt 42 Chr, 164) An illicit excavation at Ag.

Eight rescue excavations, mainly from the cemetery areas, are reported by the Ephorate for 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 169-175) The most important evidence comes from the Obruolakkas district and concerns the C city wall which here lies outside the medieval fortifications. The wall, with a width of 3.3-4m, was traced for some distance and was shown to be of three building phases: the first, of the 5th Ct BC, partly of polygonal masonry and including a rectangular tower, was damaged by earthquake; the second phase used the foundations and inner face of the earlier wall and dates to the 4th/3rd Ct BC; the last phase, built on top of the previous one is hard to date but seems to be ECh. The extent of the C town is noted in anc. sources. At Athenon 12 (OT 162) EHL domestic architecture comprising two rooms (and a storage pithos) was notable for the inclusion of blocks, probably from the sea wall of the C city. This level was overlaid by LR/ECh building which, in its turn, was cut into by 10 later pit graves (several with multiple burials, no offerings, evidence of wooden coffins). Two HL graves in OT 233 had a few sherds outside but no offerings except, in one, 14 iron nails around the head, shoulders and spine of the skeleton. Two of five ECh tombs at Apokaukou 4 contained interesting finds: rings and earrings of unusual type. Nea Pleurona. In 1987 work started on the cleaning of the theatre, the agora and other standing monuments of the city. An approach for visitors was constructed after the cutting of the dense undergrowth. (ADelt 42 Chr, 183) In 1993 co-operation between the University of Vienna and the Ephorate began with the further exploration of the HL city of Pleuron. A topographical plan was drawn up of the largely robbed (anc. and recent) necropolis, and a ChT (T 2), consist- ing of an antechamber and two rooms with couches, was excavated (Fig. 11). The main gate was measured and a plan started of the theatre, which lies in an unusual location in the city. In addition, cleaning work was carried out in the city. Neapolis (former Rouseika). At Paliokastro within the military area, five HL cist tombs came to light in 1987; T 3 was particularly rich in typical gold objects. (ADelt 42 Chr, 179) Ochthia: bed of the Acheloos. A R country house complex of at least seven rooms came to light in 1987; evidence of storage and of wine production was noted. Coins of Antoninus Pius (138-161 AD) give a date though pottery was not found, only a few fragments of glass. The complex lies at a depth of 6m, showing the amount of river deposit since that time. The site lies on much-used routes through the area and may also have served as an inn at a crossing point of the river. (ADelt 42 Chr, 175-6) Palaiomanina (anc. Sauria). Work started in 1987 on the cleaning of this site. (ADelt 42 Chr, 183) Paliampela (?anc. Echinos).

Excavations at the Taxiarchs Ermitsas site (on the Agrinion-Athens national highway) revealed extensive burials of various kinds, appearing to date from the Frankish period. Finds included a gold ring with a semi-precious stone and inscription AVE M/ARIA, 356 coins of Guy II de la Roche (?), the base of a stone templon screen, masonry fragments, unpainted pottery and six Venetian coins. Excavations were to continue. (ADelt 42 Chr, 330) Papadates. In 1987 at Phylobryso two HL kilns were found during mechanical digging from which they suffered damage. The area of the better preserved was expropriated and the site is visitable.

The EH site was tested in 1987 over a wide area being cleared for development, but little of note came to light; the major part of the site lies underwater and was excavated by the Underwater Ephorate. (ADelt 42 Chr, 176-7) Sitaralona: Paliogousiane. In 1987 a further HL cist tomb of the known cemetery (AR 1985-86, 48) came to light with the remains of two burials, one on top of the collected bones of the other. Finds from the first burial were found outside to the SE and those of the second within the tomb. (ADelt 42 Chr, 181) At Mesobouni anc. structures came to light which will be further investigated. The absence of walls suggests that it may be another shrine with relation to that at Thermon. (ADelt 42 Chr, 184) Spolaita: Paliokastro (anc. Agrinion). On the W slopes of the hill a small A country shrine was cleared in 1987. This was in use from the middle of the 6th to the end of 4th Ct BC. Originally the cult used the crevices in the rock, with the whole area enclosed by a wall, but in C times a series of rectangular structures was built. The adjacent stream, Platanor- ema, not only supplied building material but played an important role in the cult. A bothros contained cult items. Votives were mainly figurines of girls and women in a great variety of types, and small vessels, but the former were divided between two areas, with on the S figurines of deities dining and on the N figurines of girls. There was also an extraordi- nary complex of offerings: a stone pillar capped with a up- turned kylix krater (with heads of a man and a woman on either side) and covered by a group of plates and a skyphos, and over these river slabs and pieces of Laconian tiles. The offerings suggest the worship of Artemis and Demeter, as well as Dionysus. (ADelt 42 Chr, 177-9) Cleaning of the city walls was started. At Leibadakia the cleaning of the stoa (part of the agora of the city) was also started. (ADelt 42 Chr, 183) Stratos. A further section of the cemetery came to light in 1987; six tombs were cleared (two tile, four cist). Five were C, one R and all but one contained typical but unostentatious grave goods. (ADelt 42 Chr, 179) Cleaning of the walls, of the Temple of Zeus Stratios and of other public buildings was started as well as that of the site at Pazaraki. (ADelt 42 Chr, 183) Thermo. Cleaning of the wall of the Temple of Apollo was started in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 183) I. Papapostolou publishes the results of his work in 1990 in PAE 109-112 and reports on that of 1993 in Ergon 44-58. Excavation continued in the PR levels under SE corer of the Temple of Apollo in three stages: removal of the backfill which post-dates Rhomaios' 1913-14 excavations, exposure of the PR walls and examination of the untouched section faces and, finally, excavation of in situ levels where possible. The full 21m length of the E side of Megaron B has been exposed, together with a short section of the S wall, which appears to have been built in two stages (or reconstructed earlier this century). The upright slabs which Rhomaios thought to be supports for a wooden jamb at the end of the wall were no longer to be found, although the stone 'floor' reported by him was still in place inside the comer. (cf Rhomaios' section E-E in ADelt 1915, 245 fig 10). Further slabs were found outside the corer and it can now be seen that this floor antedates the Megaron. It now seems that the Megaron was constructed on a prepared platform to create a level floor surface within, while the walls themselves, which are deeper in the S than in the N, were set as far as possible on the sloping bedrock below. Although it has not yet been possible to verify Rhomaios' section Z-H (loc cit fig 12), it is now clear that only the clay floor shown there is contemporary with the Megaron, while the stone floor and lower ash level must predate it. The rough stone structure which Rhomaios found 1.5m S of the end of the E wall, and thought to be a setting for one columns of the elliptical peristyle, was also uncovered. Since, however, it is 80cms below the level of the peristyle slabs, it can have no connection with it. A further test was made under the S wall of the temple, which is poorly preserved. This revealed a mound of stones and clay with a hollow in its upper surface containing a small iron knife. A large slab was apparently set upright in the top of the mound and surrounded with ash and organic material, which contained three iron spearheads and a small curved iron knife. The excavator suggests that this feature was visible while Megaron B was in use and that its construction should be linked to some cult connected with an earlier hero's tomb. Work also continued in the E stoa, where a second opening was found in the E wall opposite the 25th and 26th column bases. This opening corresponds with the passageway opposite between the W and S stoas. The stoa was shortened during</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 reconstruction at the end of the 3rd Ct by the construction of a cross wall incorporating the 31st column base. The bench along the E side extended as far as this wall and in the corer were the stone supports for a table, as also found in the NE corer of the stoa. The remaining part of the stoa to the S served as a separate room. Traces of red plaster were preserved on the column bases here and two successive floors were found. The upper floor was heavily burnt and had small fragments of bronze statues or offerings on it. It seems that, while the main part of the stoa was used in the 2nd Ct BC for public assemblies, the S room housed bronzes. The year's work was completed with the preparation of the first general plan of the sanctuary (Ergon (1993) 54, fig 66). Thyrreio.

Thirteen excavations are reported by the Ephorate in 1987, several continuing work of the previous years. (ADelt 42 Chr, 165-9) Part of the HL city wall was cleared on Dichaliaon at the point called Loutro, where a rectangular cistern of the R water system and an ECh outer wall also came to light. At another spot on the same road, a wall was cleared which may form another part of the HL circuit but is more likely to be terracing along the adjacent watercourse. At Kaminia on the side of the acropolis of Ag. Phanentes, several tests were made disclosing: first, a three-room structure of the end of the 4th/beginning of the 3rd Ct BC, destroyed in the 2nd Ct AD which was then built over and finally used for graves (tiled); second, the probable site of a small shrine identified from cuttings in the rock; third, four R tile graves and funerary enclosures with a destruction level of the 4th/3rd Ct BC beneath; fourth, a building level of LC or HL date. The whole area was extreme- ly rich in finds of all kinds, but it may be noted that PR occupation of the area is suggested by obsidian and flint blades. At Spetson and Kyprou four rooms of a R house destroyed by earthquake were excavated, while at I. Metaxa 31 an ECh destruction level overlay a R house with tile walls and mosaic floor. Notable among the tombs were: at I. Metaxa and Anonymos four enclosures (two of the 1st Ct BC, and one each of the 1st and 2nd Cts AD) by the cemetery road (AR 1992-93, 26) containing 33 tombs of various types and six pyres with very rich finds and a tile stamped BACIAEIOC EHIIIANOC, with a 2nd Ct AD tiled chamber over the N enclosure; on Dichalion at Tseka a R tomb cut in the rock (perhaps originally a cave) with cuttings above for the slab with the name, which has been left open and visitable; in Ag. Phanentes nine tile graves of the 4th Ct BC destroyed in roadworks but producing pots, nails and a silver ring; at Loutrou and Anonymos, amid HL walls, R drains and a Ch tile tomb, a small circular HL structure with traces of burning inside; two C/HL burial pithoi at the Kentro Ygeias. On Souedias at the Plateia Platanou during the construction of a public fountain, a R female statue of the 2nd Ct AD in an ECh level came to light. Tzanata (Poros). Further reports of the Myc tholos tomb under excavation here appear in Ethnos 10.6.93 and Apogeuma- tine 1.7.93; the tomb had been robbed but is linked by the press to the name of Odysseus. Many further accounts of the tomb followed in the press of 23.1, 30.1, 6.2, and 13-16.2.94. The issue has stirred considerable rivalry between Kephallenia and Ithake. ELEIA (7th Ephorate) The gift of an important collection of coins to the Olympia Museum is reported in Eleutheros Typos 23.7.93. The find of a mamoth tooth from the Olympia area is reported in Eleutherotypia 14.4.94. Morea Project. A third season of the Minnesota Morea Project took place in 1993; F.A, Cooper and J.D. Alchermes (ASCS) report: "Our Trimble Pathfinder GPS (Global Positioning System) was of limited use in 1992 due to the imposition of Selective Availability on many of the relevant satellites by the US Dept. of Defence, therefore we had to resort to the very much slower and tedious methods of conventional surveying. For the 1993 season we added a base station to our GPS system. Installed at Neohorio, with an antenna at a known benchmark or reference coordinate, the base station collects signals from the same constellation of satellites as our two field rover receivers. A complex computer program assesses the error caused by Selective Availability and corrects the coordinates or waypoints gathered by the rover GPS's. In 1993, when satellite reception was rated as good to excellent, our points were accurate to centimetres; and when rated fair to poor, the points nonetheless were off by no more than five to seven metre. This GPS method is known as differential correction and enabled our crews not only to increase the efficiency and accuracy by which we mapped the villages, but also to create plans of the extensive Frankish site of Kastro tis Oreias (begun in 1992) and the Kastro at Portai. For the 1993 season we also adopted the HP 48SL handheld computer in order to enter electronically labels for each of the waypoints into a computer database. This procedure further reduced the post-processing of data and facilitated the gener- ation of working plans and drawings. As in 1991 and 1992, selection of a village for recording was based first upon its inclusion in the Venetian censuses of 1689 and 1700, as compiled by V. Panaghiotopoulos in Plithysmos kai Oikismoi tis Peloponnesou (Athens, 1987). In any such village, we then required that a minimum of 5-10 pre- beton houses still exist before choosing it for recording. Information obtained from villagers also led to the discovery of sites and villages not gleaned from the censuses. Thanks to the loan of Aphendra Moutzali we also made extensive use of Meletemata: Paysages d'Achaie I, edited by A.D. Rozakis (Athens, 1992). In total, 640 houses in 20 villages were drawn. In addition to the survey of villages, the 1993 season included the record- ing of three Frankish citadels: Kastro tis Oreias, Gyphto Kastro and Kastro Portai; and the prospection of two others: Kastro Sandomeri and Ag. Triada. Another 300 ruins of buildings were drawn at Kastro tis Oreias and Kastro tis Portai. In past seasons we surmised that limited vehicular access was a major factor for the preservation of historic houses and buildings. The experience of this year requires modification of this hypothesis. The cross-roads towns of Riolos and Chaland- ritsa, for example, preserve 60 and 110 venerable houses respectively, whereas the traditional architecture in the more inaccessible villages of Mitopolis and Flokas has been entirely 25</page><page sequence="24">26 E.B. FRENCH Fig. 13 replaced by summer houses of beton construction, mostly built by migrants to Athens and other metropolitan places. We have found that local pride plays a major force in the conservation of houses. Also the younger, educated mayors in Riolos and Chalandritsa encourage their constituencies to share their interest in the local history. One happy consequence, in terms of this project, is that our crews were warmly welcomed wherever we showed up. A comparison of houses recorded in 1991 in villages of the Alpheios watershed and those drawn in 1992 in the area of the Peneios River has revealed a number of interesting regional variations in architectural detailing and construction. This phenomenon continued in 1993. Again, many more date stones were found this year than in 1991. And again inscribed and verbal evidence of Epirote stonemasons was reconfirmed, whereas the villages surveyed further S in 1991 had a tradition of Langadian stonemasons. Furthermore, construction stones sculpted with dates, heads, crosses, cypresses, birds, dancing women, etc., were more frequently found than in the past season. Two triglyphs and a related HL tower lie in a field just N on the road to Ag. Marinis Maritsis. Word of this site came with inquiries about a C, grey limestone triglyph built into the wall of a fountain in upper Sandomeri. An spiral marble column lies nearby. An small, unfluted column lies in a kafeneion plataia at Sandomeri. Several other constructions of interest were noted: two stone arched bridges at Lambia; an Ott well with a spiral platform at Petrohori; a vaulted bridge, perhaps of R date, a Frankish tower and a large mill complex at Chalandritsa."

A female figurine of the same date was also found. Olympia. In 1993 two major campaigns were carried out by the DAI at Olympia under the direction of H. Kyrieleis, in addition to the study of material from previous campaigns. The following is reported: "Within the framework of the research project Olympia during the Era of the R Emperors, U. Sinn (Augsburg) continued the excavation of the installation situated S-W of the Leonidaion. As before, two questions were uppermost: When was the structure built? What purpose did it serve? Undisturbed layers by the foundations in the N and E confirmed previous observations that the installation was built during the 2nd half of the 1st Ct AD. The chronology is based on, amongst other things, important finds of Gallic and Italian sigillata, Cretan amphoras and Ephesian 'red-on-white' lamps. Investigation of the carefully executed reticulated work (opus mixtum) of the first building phase leaves no doubt that at the beginning of building operations a builders' guild from Rome itself (Imperial?) was involved (Fig. 13). The irregular upper edges of the wall tracts in opus mixtum hint at the abrupt departure of the R builders. Clearing the first of three halls inside the building brought a surprise: under a 4m layer of debris and flood deposit, the remains of a hypocaust came to light (Fig. 14). It does not belong to the original concept and was installed during a later rebuilding of the whole complex, which cannot be dated at this stage. In addition, the complete removal of the lowest floor level makes it impossible to establish the original purpose of the room. The subsequent addition of the hypocaust contradicts the notion that the room was a bathroom. Excavations also continued in the peristyle court in front of the building. On the E side a hall of ca 10 x 10m was cleared; it corresponds exactly to the one found on the W side and has the same wide door (ca 7m) opening onto the peristyle. The whole peristyle is clad in marble, yet the floors in both halls are of compacted clay. The present interpretation that they were ceromata (i.e. training halls for athletes) remains valid. Further sections of the portico discovered last year in front of the N side were cleared and contain the entrance. The portico delimits the road leading into the sanctuary from the W. Several patches of a thick layer of gravel came to light which covered the surface of the road. For the first time excavations were extended to the small baths situated between the SW Building and the Leonidaion. Stratigraphical observations made in the foundations show that the baths were not built, as previously thought, in the early 3rd Ct AD, but at the earliest in the 2nd half of that century, perhaps even in the early 4th Ct AD. It provides further evidence of damage done at Olympia by the invasion of the Heruli in 267 BC.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 27 The clearing-up operations started by K. Hermann in the S- W Altis and the Leonidaion were continued in three sectors. Most important was the salvaging of architectural elements which had fallen into the W water channel of the courtyard during an earthquake in antiquity. They provided important information about the shape of the columns and later changes in the geison and roofing. Two small architectural elements were assembled from salvaged and misplaced fragments. Differences in the measurements which came to light during the planning of the stadium led to a re-examination of the architectural remains, in particular of all known starting blocks. Apart from the limestone blocks in situ which, in their present arrangement, do not belong to the original C stadium III, 18 poros blocks were found which belong to the three earlier phases of the stadium and gymnasium. With a view to future restoration, the examination of the Temple of Zeus continued, and further column drums were drawn. It was found that not only the W columns but also those of the E front in the area of the hypotrachelion have to be corrected."

The third season of work on the wreck in front of the main port of Zakynthos took place in 1993, under the direction of Katerina Delaportas (of the Ephorate of Under- water Archaeology) and Mensun Bound (BSA); they report: "The wreck, which is at a depth of 10m beside the Dimitris or Signallo Reef, is believed to date to the 16th Ct. Two new trenches were opened during the 1993 season. Each was 1.5 x 1.5m and they were situated im apart along the vessel's W side. One trench was almost fully excavated; the other was half finished. Important results concern the disposition of the timbers within the two trenches. Finds consisted of large numbers of hazel nuts, badly fragmented pottery, silver coins (most of which were heavily concreted) and for the first time, small pieces of raw glass cullet. From the nature of these finds, and the absence of anything of a more domestic nature, it seemed safe to assume that we were within the cargo are of the ship. Analyses of the coins (carried out by the Numismatic Museum in Athens) revealed that they were blanks. The very large number of hazel nuts that the ship was carrying has been a bit puzzling, but an aside in Hakluyt which dates to the Fig. 14</page><page sequence="26">28 E.B. FRENCH second half of the 16th Ct, gives some insight: 'The chiefe towne of the country is called Zagham, from whence is carried yearly into Persia, an incredible quantitie of hasell nuts, all of one sort and goodnesse and as good and this shaled as are our Filberds. Of these are carried yearly the quantity of 4000 camels laden". This reference, together with the discovery of the glass, seems to bolster our previous view that the vessel was heading S, away from the Adriatic. The dating of this site has always been a problem but, on very slender evidence (the coakes and stone cannon balls), we at present favour a 16th Ct origin for the vessel. The only parallels for the coakes (of which we are aware) are all from 16th Ct shipwrecks. The presence of the stone cannon balls support this date as it is generally believed that, by 1600, most leading nations had moved from stone to iron for their shot; however a diminishing number of stone cannon balls have been found on a minority of sites that date to after 1600. Although almost certainly a merchantman, we still have not been able to determine whether or not this was a galley. If this is a galley then we would expect to find a complex internal sturucture of timbers and, at first glance, this does indeed appear to be what we have."

Themelis publishes his work in 1990 in PAE 56-103 and reports on his work in 1993 in Ergon 26-43. The temenos Q-Qg, W of the Asclepieion, appears to be a heroon. It is 23 x 23m in size with an entrance from the N and contained 18 areas. In the centre was a court surrounded by stoas (wooden columns are suggested). Beneath lay an earlier phase (7th to 1st Ct BC) with a long narrow building ( 3.5 x 11.6m), an altar and a round structure. In the centre of the court was a pit with many votives and architec- tural fragments, obviously the residue of cleaning up the sanctuary after a major disaster. As the cult antedates the founding of the city and the offerings are of both Laconian and Messenian origin, it is suggested that the complex honoured a local hero and his spouse, perhaps King Leukippos and his family; the later sanctuary was dedicated to Demeter (accord- ing to Pausanias). Important finds from this area include a male statue of the Hermes of Andros type (used for leaders and heroes) and a statue base inscribed on the face with the record of the 35 victories of an unknown local athlete (as boy, youth and man) in wrestling and the pankration at festivals all over Greece. The reverse bears a honorific inscription of the 2nd Ct AD. Below the S court of the HL Asclepieion, where the slope has allowed preservation of earlier levels, a stoa (5.5 x 1 lm as preserved) facing E with wooden columns on stone bases came to light; it had a wooden ceiling and both Laconian and Corinthian tiles (one stamped iep[6c], tci 4tix[ ....... ). In-fill between the columns belongs to a secondary phase. The dating of the building awaits further work but it seems that this building formed the W edge of the earlier Asclepieion. Further work to the E adds weight to the suggestion that the Heroon A is that honouring the sculptor Damophon, known from an inscription. An important decree of the 2nd Ct BC was found near here. As Pausanias proceded from the Asclepieion to the gymnasion he came to the Ierothysion with statues of the 12 gods, a statue of Epaminondas and 'ancient tripods'; S of the baths of the Asclepieion clearance has brought to light a large building complex running E-W and incorporating two passageways, rooms of as yet unknown use and a court. Finds include a headless marble statue of Aphrodite, the fragment of a female statue with head covered and an inscription with two scraps of musical notation. In the Heroon/Mausoleion S of the stadium, clearance and recording of fallen blocks was com- pleted; excavation produced more architectural pieces, sculp- tures, and a large number of inscribed grave stelai that had been incorporated in the podium. A hearth/bothros built of well fashioned blocks linked by iron bonding had signs of very heavy burning and must be associated with cult activities. The purchase of land outside the N wall to allow the restoration of tower 17 (the first NE of the Arcadian Gate) led to the excavation of funerary monuments, already partly visible on the surface. The first of two beside the anc. road is 14.4 x 12m and consists of two chambers. It is faced by a Doric stoa on a 7 step base with brick superstructure and a vaulted ceiling. HL stelai were reused in the construction. In the chambers were pits on either side of the door for the insertion of marble sarcophagi. Fragments of one from the N chamber show it to be Attic work of the period of Hadrian. Also from the same workshop, though later, is an undecorated sarcophagus in a rock cutting in the same area. A hoard of 1,400 coins of the 4th-5th Ct AD were found in a jar beneath the floor and, with the fragment of an ECh inscription, attest later re-use. Also in this monument were found a marble base with cutting and a piece of a marble herm. Messene is almost certainly the source for the inscribed herm from Korone (now in the Kalamata Museum). The second funerary monument is smaller (7 x 9m) and of HL date. It has a podium with upper moulding and an entrance chamber open to the road, with pilasters.

The fourth season of the Minnesota Pylos Project took place in 1993 under F.A. Cooper and M.C. Nelson (ASCS); they report: "As in 1991 and 1992, our purpose was to clear the area of backfill in order to create a state plan of the walls; earth was removed down to the lowest course of stone or to the level reached by the original excavators. A decision was made in 1992 to clear floors as well as walls; nevertheless, the presence of Blegen's backfill still defined in every case the extent of our own cleaning and operations. This season was devoted to clearing and re-examination of the whole of the NE portion of the site outside the Palace proper, within areas 91-104. At the NE, near the Myc entryway, we cleared a small length of the aqueduct and the complex identified as a kiln. Our investiga- tion of the area around the wine magazine in 1992, and the broader cleaning of the entire are to the SE in 1993 has led to a conclusion that the numerous underlying floors of fine plaster and a miscellany of stretches of walls all represent a large building or several smaller buildings of pre-palatial date. In order to study the area in its totality it was decided that with the close of each season we will cover the cleared areas with woven nylon tarpaulins and then spread sifted backfill on top of those. When the entire site has been cleared, anticipated after the 1995 season, comprehensive photographs will be taken, especially by low-altitude balloon. We continued to employ the excavation methods outlined in 1992. Careful sifting of backfill still represents a large portion of the overall effort. The results of sifting continue to be rewarding as attested by the recovery of fragments of Linear B Tablets, pieces of fresco and miscellaneous finds. Bi-pod photography also was improved with the adoption of professional survey range poles made of high tensile aluminum tubes that come in detachable sections and which can carry a camera mount and camera at a height of 5m. In cooperation with PRAP a magnetometer survey was run across the broad stretch of acropolis that lies to the NE of the Palace. This non-intrusive form of archaeologi- cal remote sensing revealed the existence of two, possibly three, unexcavated structures within the survey's boundaries. The most prominent lies 10-15m NE of the wine magazine, alongside the NW edge of the acropolis slope. Of more immediate use was the pinpointing of the kiln and of the water conduit excavated by Blegen in the mid-sixties. The trenches for these features were never tied by survey into permanent points and the outline of the trenches no longer appear on the ground surface. The magnetometer survey greatly facilitated our investigations in this area and will become a useful guide in future excavations at the Palace. In 1991 we cleaned and drew only the walls but not the floors of the NE building and postponed until this year the cleaning of the more complex and puzzling ramp 91, cistern 102, and the conjunction of water channels at 101. We realized last season that the floors in the outlying buildings contain features often unnoted by Blegen, and these fully deserve examination, recording and study. For this reason we returned to finish this part of the NW building and related structures. The painted stucco altar 92 was briefly exposed for colour photographs and drawings, as were the multi-levels, hence phases, of plaster floors abutting and surrounding this decorated base. Blegen excavated a stone- lined shaft grave in room 97, but never executed a plan or section. The broad plastered ramp represents an impressive piece of construction; its purpose remains enigmatic. It is the latest phase of a series of floors and abuts both the open water conduit along the NE flank and the outer walls of rooms 42 and 47. At several places, where portions of the upper layer have broken away, a lower level of plaster floor is exposed. Several patches run underneath the outer walls of rooms 42 and 47; the clearest instances are at the SE corer of room 47 and the NE corer of room 42. Moreover, area 102, identified by Blegen as a cistern, is in fact a small room that continues underneath the outside portion of the double-curtain construc- tion of the wall to room 42. The SW wall to room 102 was later incorporated as an inside curtain to this wall of room 42. Further to the NW we re-exposed the terracotta basin and the large circular construction ca 1.4m in diameter. The reason for the tub being left in its present position and the function of the circular base persist as unexplained problems. A long water channel starts from the entranceway at the NE edge of the acropolis and continues to the flank of the Palace at area 101 where it branches, one leg passing into room 42, the other turning to the S and running in the open stone channel along the base of the wall to rooms 93 to 97. Construction disinte- grates as the channel approaches the top of the slope to the SW. This water system deserves investigation and study beyond what it has received so far. It is clear that it cuts into the lower and earlier level of plaster floor in this area. On the other hand, it is an integral part of the construction of the plastered ramp but it is also evident that it precedes the erection of the SW flank wall to the NE building. In any case, we plan to expose in the coming 1994 season enough of the water channel to obtain accurate elevations and drawings of its construction in order to better assess its design. Linear B Tablet and Fresco Fragments: Over the past three seasons we have learned that the protective covering of Blegen's excavated backfill contains overlooked fragments of Linear B Tablets and frescos. Five small pieces of fired clay, identified as probably Linear B Tablets, came from the area around room 100, the site of the tablet discovery in 1991. Two examples bear incisions and await further study. Plaster and fresco fragments, on the other hand, appear to be evenly distributed throughout the re-sifted backfill: 433 examples were collected from 20 different units. The most important fragment forms a part of the famous 'griffin and lion' fresco from the Queen's Hall, room 46. This fragment has been placed on display in the Chora Museum with other fragments of the scene. Feathered lines on the newly found fragment suggest a position along one of the animals' tails; further study may help determine a more exact location. As noted in last year's report, the quantity of important finds was unexpected. This season we began processing the material, starting with the fresco fragments. For the cataloguing of finds, we adopted a system based on bar code. Pre-printed labels of a random number set contain a printed number and the corresponding bar code. Each number has three labels: the first is glued to the object by water-soluble glue, the second is attached to the appropriate locus sheet and the third goes onto a serial inventory sheet. A digital wand attached to a bar code reader scans the label and enters the inventory number directly into the separate databases for classes of finds and locus sheets. In the case of fresco fragments, the additional information includes an accurate evaluation of colour using the international standards estab- lished by the Pantone Process Colour System. A drawing of each fragment is digitized into an AutoCAD file using a code that allows for a colour representation to appear on the computer console and eventually to be printed by colour laser printer. Our Geographic Information System (GIS) allows for the integration of the AutoCAD files and the database files. Colour prints of each fragment are also part of the multi- correlation that we expect will facilitate the joining of frag- ments in a future restoration of the fresco scenes recovered. 29</page><page sequence="28">30 E.B. FRENCH Fig. 15 Topographic Survey: Our Trimble Pathfinder GPS (Global Positioning System) was of limited use in 1992 due to the imposition of Selective Availability on many of the relevant satellites by the US Department of Defense. Selective Avail- ability refers to the deliberate distortion of satellite signals, with the result that waypoints have a maximum deviation factor of +/- 300m rather than the +/- 2-5m that we achieved in 1991. This year we added a base station to our GPS system. Installed at Gialova with an antenna at a known benchmark or reference coordinate, the base station collects signals from the same constellation of satellites as our two field rover receivers. a complex computer program assesses the error caused by Selective Availability and corrects the coordinates or waypoints gathered by the rover GPS's. In 1993 when satellite reception was rated as good to excellent our points were accurate to centimetres and when rated fair to poor the points nonetheless were off by no more than 5&gt;7m. This GPS method is known as differential correction. After the slowdown in 1992, good progress towards the completion of a detailed topographical survey resumed this year: positions of individual trees in several olive groves which immediately surround the acropolis were mapped, and traverse points were re-fixed in preparation for continued research along the Ano Engliano ridge in 1994." The Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP) completed its second season of surface survey in 1993 under the auspices of the ASCS. Professor Jack Davis, the overall director, reports: "Approximately 11 sq.km were intensively surveyed in 1993. Nine sites were investigated. Teams operated princi- pally along the coast to the N of the bay of Navarino, between Bouka and Marathopolis and the vicinity of Romanou. In the coastal areas of Pleistocene soils, the anc. settlement hierarchy does not appear much different from that in the marly inland areas examined in 1992. The settlement pattern was dominated in pre-mod. times by large nucleated settlements. Of particular note is the extreme scarcity of evidence for small historical sites of A-HL, or Byz date-the sort that have been interpreted as farmhouses elsewhere in Greece. Modest-sized sites of MByz date, so common in the E Peloponnese, are also in short supply. In contrast, widespread Pal remains have been found on these old soils, including a small open-air site to the N of Bouka. Other significant PR discoveries include two new Myc sites and one of the EBA. N of the large A to R town at Romanou, described in last year's report, many traces of anc. buildings were investigated at Dialiskari, including the hypocaust for a R bath and a mosaic floor (Fig. 15); the majority of the associated ceramics belong to the HL through R eras. The existence of several of these constructions was noted already by N. Valmin. At Romanou, continuing investigations built on foundations laid in 1992; systematic surface samples were collected in the areas of densest surface artifacts (some 40 hectares) according to a sampling strategy pioneered for the collection of surface finds in the Corinthia at Phlious. At the S end of the site, an epistyle block from a monumental structure was located; at its N end, a possible new cemetery of PR ChTs was investigated by magnetometry and electric resistivity. On the Englianos Ridge, our goal in 1993 was to gather additional information that would permit the reconstruction in greater detail of the history of settlement around the Palace of Nestor. Professor Cooper and his University of Minnesota team established a permanent grid around the Palace of Nestor that served as the basis for surface collection and geophysical survey. Surface artifacts in each of 180 20 x 20m grid squares were systematically collected. Several areas of high density were subsequently examined by magnetometry and geological coring in an attempt to discover if subsurface cultural deposits perhaps even architectural remains, were intact. These investigations have unfortunately not yet produced evidence for extensive cultural deposits in situ beneath the plough zone. The construction of terraces for olive cultivation has done irreparable harm to the anc. site, as has continuous tilling of the soil, which has accelerated erosion of the soft marly soils and bedrock. On the other hand, also in cooperation with the University of Minnesota team, magnetometric prospection in unexcavated areas inside the archaeological site of the Palace of Nestor was successful in locating several new unexcavated buildings and walls, and in determining the exact course of the so-called aqueduct, parts of which had been excavated by Blegen NE of the Palace."

The consolidation of the 11th Ct AD frescoes continued; these are by the same painter as those of the neighbouring churches of Ag. Merkourios at Ag. Markos and of Ag. Nikolaos at Kato Korakiana. There was shown to be a niche in the E wall which had been later blocked up; it was decorated with a fresco depicting a saint with a red beard wearing a cope; below was a painted base as in the other churches. On the right of the niche were portrayed a deacon and a military saint. Consolidation was completed on the E gable, decorated with a representation of the Epiphany with, on the right, a winged bull and an angel. Beliane (Souliou).

A R structure with tiles and unpainted wares came to light in 1987 during the excavation of a bothros. In the Panagiou plot on the road to Roda a LR structure came to light, with a clear destruction layer with tiles, stones and traces of fire, and with an EByz apsidal building abutting it.

(AR 1992-93, 34-5) In 1987 three plots were investigated in the Figareto area; one produced a C structure but little information but important results came from the Mikalef and the A. Doukake plots (the latter E of the previously excavated Euelpide plot). The former is a workshop area where two more kilns (#6 and #7) were cleared as well as a deposit containing inter alia 13 LA kalathiskoi and a bf kylix. The contents of both kilns, but #6 in particular, confirms that the amphora type 'Corinthian B' is in fact Corcyran. A diagram of the chronological development of this type is given. In the Doukake plot was found a HL courtyard with mosaic and a well with three rooms on the NE and SE; the last usage of these was contemporary with the court, but they had been constructed as early as the 7th Ct BC. Finds included A, C and HL pottery, figurines including a mould, bronze coins of 300- 299, an A silver stater and masses of oxidized iron. In a plot in Basile adjacent to Mon Repos, in cooperative work between the Ephor and Professor Hackens (et al.), preliminary excava- tion revealed a LR tile floor. In Garitsa, in the cemetery area of the anc. town, a number of burials were cleared: six large pithoi, four small pithoi of children, four tile graves, one poros sarcophagus, four pits in the soil, two cremations in urns, 22 funerary vases (not yet mended); these, very largely disturbed, dated from A through C to HL. At Kanalia in the SW cemetery a HL tile grave with a pyxis and a few finds can be added to the scattered A and HL tombs already known.

Pottery was C and HL with some R unpainted wares but the major find was a mass of female figurines which may be associated with the cave of the nymphs mentioned by Pausanias.

Pottery is mostly table- and cooking- ware of the 12th-14th Ct AD. A hoard of 16 Deniers Toumois of the 13th-14th Ct was found amongst other coin finds (C to MByz and Med), along with a 13-14th Ct lead seal with a dedication to Ag. Prokopios. Wall-painting fragments appear to be representative of 13th Ct Theban painting, no monument of which has survived. On Belou Louka four cist graves were discovered, all of which had been used as ossuaries. Only one LR coin was reported as being identified; others remain to be cleaned to help date the tombs. Byz remains of buildings and objects were found a little further up the same street, including a Byz structure above PR foundations and floors. Finds included 13-14th Ct glazed ware and four as yet (1987) uncleaned coins. PHOKIS (10th Ephorate) No report for 1987 is published in ADelt 42 Chr,. The French School (J. Oulhen and D.

The anc. supporting walls consist of large, finely-cut blocks which fit neatly; mod. walls consist simply of piled up field stones. Orthogonality of streets and zw 'a ~~iF ~~~housing blocks is not evidenced on the site. From its very urban beginnings the layout derived its bearings from the undulating configuration of the hillside. It is further debatable to what extent Kallipolis was a city in the proper geographical sense of the word. Though monumental constructions have been identified in four places, the size of the town can prob- ably not be compared to that of cities such as Kassope or Fig. 20 Fig. 22 Fig. 21 Mavroneri. Near the church of Ag. Ioannis some anc. blocks were noted by the French School survey with others along the canal running W of the church probably forming the founda- tions of a structure.

Observation of ancient remains was facilitated by dry weather conditions; and the low level of the water of the Momos reservoir laid bare the greater part of the excavations of 1976-1979. As the survey map of the interior of the city of Kallipolis is not yet finished, and has not yet been published, checks and additions could be made.

The greater part of the Kastro was uninhabitable (zone III) or thinly occupied (zone II). The town itself was apparently confined to the low-lying, terraced zone I (Fig. 25). It is also clear now that in R-Byz times the same zone I was used for habitation, although the architecture was more frugal than that of the HL epoch. An important ECh church stood in the R-Byz town in a spot that is still being referred to as Episkope by the former villagers of Kallion. In this context it is relevant to note that for the communities in the vicinity of Steno, at the cross-roads of communications in the mountain world of E Aitolia, bishops (episkopoi) are on record from the 10th Ct up to the 19th. Exploration of the stone-producing hill slopes was continued and important new evidence became available. In contrast with Goritsa, where building stone was usually extracted in proper quarries, exploitation at Veloukhovo was haphazard. The technique of extraction can be documented in detail, though. The best stone was apparently found on the highest parts of the hill within a fairly narrow strip inside and to the E of the acropolis, but also extending further S, outside the Kastro as far as the highest section of the Steno Cemetery. Thick- bedded, hard limestone could be obtained inside this strip. Artificial embankments made for transporting stone have not been identified. Stone was also extracted from a number of secondary outcrops of limestone further down the slope. Knowledge of the Ag. Nikolaos pipeline aqueduct to the Kastro was increased considerably. As the inundated village of Kallion largely re-emerged from the lake in 1993, a pipe segment excavated by the villagers after World War II in order to be re-used at the time as a chimney pipe of an oven (measured by me at an awkward angle in 1977) could now be retrieved from the debris of the collapsed oven. The anc. pipe segment proved to be still intact; it was taken to Lidoriki, where a new drawing was made. Along the line of the aqueduct, as indicated to us by the villagers in the years 1976- 77, fragments of pipes and complete pipes were now observed in three places, in two of them somewhat out of position but in the talus of a revma still in situ (more than one pipe; length measurable on the inside: 1.12m). The length of the aqueduct from the spring of Ag. Nikolaos to the Kastro wall was approximately</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 700m. The pipes must have lain in a trench, just under the surface of the earth. The pipeline entered the Kastro at mid height. Its line inside the Kastro is not known nor can a date be suggested. In the Med site on the acropolis in 1988 and 1991 major progress had been made in the survey measuring of the extensive remains of the fortified medieval settlement, particu- larly of its interior. The fortification wall had been measured and described in 1977. The Med site consists of three sectors, each of them lying on a different level. The lord of the settlement lived on the wind-swept top level in a donjon or keep, the lower part of which is well preserved. The middle sector did not contain habitation, but there was a cistern. The presence of cisterns also in the other two sectors is now confirmed. The spacious lower sector was fairly thickly occupied. A number of these shelters were hardly more than huts, but substantially larger structures occurred too. In order to arrive at an interpretation of the character of the site other well-preserved Med fortified sites in Greece were visited; attention was paid to the location of the towers and forts and to the possible reasons for their construction, and-where possible-to civilian Med habitation. The recent view that not only the high-positioned donjons, but also these isolated towers were tower-houses meant for habitation is a reasonable one. Lords, seigneurs, wished to live in conspicuous places. The closest parallels to the Veloukhovo Med site are Kastelli Gravias (Pyrgos), Ayios Vasilios and Kiveri. In these three places the archaeological picture leaves hardly any doubt: these fortified hilltop strongholds were not only castles where a lord lived with his family, servants and some soldiers, but also fortified villages with a civilian population. Consequently, the Med fort on Veloukhovo Hill is probably a small 'fortified deserted village', a Wiistung. The villagers were extremely poor, though. This settlement must have been medieval Loidorix. According to Bommelje and Fagel it was situated here and not on the site of present day Lidoriki. This must have been the place that was occupied by Catalan knights in the 14th Ct AD. For the time being we may assume that the Catalans not only held this place for some time but that they themselves had also built inside the ruins of the anc. Kastro, concentrating the population of the nearby hamlets into a new fort on the high hilltop. When the Catalans left, the site was probably given up as a habitat." EUBOEA (1 th Ephorate) An extensive report on the work of 1987, which benefitted from additional funding from the Ministry and the EEC, is published in ADelt 42 Chr, 200-214. In particular, considerable work was carried out on local collections in the N of the island. Work was also started on the Museum at Karystos. Various finds were handed in during the year, including amphoras from the harbour authorities at Chalkis. Annals of Anthropology and Archaeology 3, 1988-9, contains many articles concerning the island including a study of coastlines, but most notably a survey of PR sites by A. Sampson (163-181). Dr S.C. Bakhuizen of the Dutch School reports on his work on the iron ore occurrences of Central Euboea: "Important iron ore occurrences are found in Central Euboea, just as is the case in NE Boiotia on the W side of the Euboean Channel. There are a few ancient literary texts suggesting that these ores were known in antiquity and that they were exploited to some extent (Kallimachos, Heraklides, Strabo). For the greater part the ore fields lie within the territory of the anc. city-state of Chalkis. In the autumn of 1993 I visited these areas in order to get an impression of the present state of the occurrences and of their near surroundings. The following questions called for attention: How far do the ore fields lie from the inhabited areas? Could wood be found in the vicinity of the ores in order to supply fuel for smelting furnaces? What about the possibilities of transport of the smelted ores by land or by sea? Have the occurrences been disturbed by recent exploitation of the ores? Can indications for anc. mining be found in the area? What is the potential for archaeological mining and ore research in Central Euboea? The Euboian occurrences consist of two groups. They are found in the hills and mountains on either side of Mt Dirphys. The richest occurrences are those to the N of Chalkis. They lie in hills covered of old by pinewoods, and-on the whole-they are easily accessible, from the S and from the S-W. Those to the E of Mt Dirphys lie high above the steep Aegean coast, in distant locations which in antiquity constituted the border lands of the Chalkidians and the Eretrians. Access is easiest here from the Eretrian side, from the direction of present-day Kyme. It is easy to trace the occurrences because of their red-purple colour. These ores have not been exploited in recent times; they are still virgin and undisturbed. The nearest forests are those on the E flank of Mt Dirphys: the chestnut and plane woods between the villages of Steni and Metokhi. In antiquity this was Chalkidian territory. The valley of Metokhi, which also has a beach where seagoing craft might have come ashore, would have been the potential place (halfway between the E occurrences and the extensive forests) where smelting and production might have taken place (cf. Theophrastos V, 9,2 and IV, 5,4). In the zone N of Chalkis the situation is different. Within the last half century, and in particular within the last two decades, the LARKO mining company has developed the entire zone on a grand scale in order to dig the iron ores for the extraction of nickel. However, even in this area on the E and S fringes of the zone lie occurrences that are still undis- turbed, apart from a few trial trenches. Again the ores can be easily discerned because of their remarkable red-purple colour. However no indications for ancient ore exploitation were found during the 1993 visit." Amarynthos: Gerani/Ag. Kyriake. In 1987, following the report of illicit excavation, two opened trenches were found with a mass of terracotta figurines in the soil by them. Immedi- ate investigation of the trenches produced copious pottery and figurines of LA (Fig. 26) to R: from LA female protomes, standing and seated women, from HL children with drums, crowns of vine leaves with grapes, a wine skin, seated childen with slates, satyrs with double flutes, dancers and Artemis with a deer; notable from R are a child seated on a cock and a satyr with a basket on his head. Two architectural terracottas ressemble those from Magna Graecia. The presence of many whorls seems to indicate a female deity. No architectural remains were found and the site is presumably the deposit from a shrine. (ADelt 42 Chr, 213) Basiliko. A.

N of the Temple of Apollo, S. Heber uncovered two ECh tile-roofed tombs along the N-S main road of the town, containing two and three burials respectively, with head to the W and no offerings. In the same area there came to light an oval construction in dry-stone masonry and a pit of LG (2nd half of the 8th Ct BC) giving further evidence of the G deposits along the roadway beside the sanctuary behind the Temple. On the acropolis, P. Friedemann conducted three trials. The first was on the E slope of the hill at the foot of a rock exposure which had been considered an anc. quarry, on the basis of the inscription at a height of 3.40m above present ground level, dating from the end of the 6th Ct BC (IG XII,9,890). However, in the 2m of deposit above virgin soil only material of the 2nd Ct BC to the 2nd/3rd Ct AD was found, with no trace of working debris nor an A level. The idea of a quarry here must therefore be abandoned and the position of the inscription, high above contemporary habitation, emphasizes its declamatory nature. The second trial lay on the top plateau (122m) of the acropolis, where the topographic survey had revealed a long terrace; this was completely cleared to a size of 19.4 by 6.9m. This terrace is cut directly into the rock and is completely horizontal without any paving (Fig. 28); at the N it is bounded by the natural rock, cut vertically to a height of 70cm and plastered in red and yellow. Some signs of a superstructure remain. To the N of this terrace a votive deposit of the end of the 7th/beginning of the 6th Ct in a secondary context was found. This consisted of miniature hydriae of the same type as those from the deposit to the N of the Temple of Apollo, objects in bronze and lead and a fragment of gold leaf. This material seems to have been deposited in HL times. Though the exact nature of the building on this terrace is not known, both the care with which it was constructed and the exceptional position lead to the suggestion that it was a Peak Sanctuary. Pockets in the rock produced fragments of obsidian and BA pottery, mainly grey Minyan and coarse EH. EH I wares, red burnished, incised and mottled, were noted. E. Mango carried out a series of confirmatory tests in the gymnasium; pottery from below the floors gave dating evidence for the various phases. Some new water channels appeared as did a room to the N of the "tholos" and the overall plan was corrected at several points. A funerary inscription was discovered. Eretria: Magoula. Following unlicensed construction work cutting into this known PR site, systematic investigation was made. Inhabitation was from N to MH, with traces of R on part of the surface. At the N end of the area was a series of pebble floors, probably working surfaces, and circular (unexplained) pits; at the S were architectural remains. All remains lay very near the surface and were accompanied by EH II-MH pottery resulting from the heavy occupation of the site. Some material is illustrated and the finds are exhibited in the Eretria Museum. (ADelt 42 Chr, 211-3) Glypha (Vlicha). On the hill where Myc settlement remains had been found in 1977 (AR 1985-86, 40) testing before construction of a depot confirmed previous results. Further investigation of this important site is planned. (ADelt 42 Chr, 213) Karystos. In 1993 H.R. Goette (DAI) recorded the foundations and the architectural elements of the 'R Temple' in the centre of Karystos, which had been excavated by the Archaeological Society at the beginning of the century. The foundations, which were partly filled in and partly built over by a road during the Fig. 28 last decades, have an almost square ground-plan and five steps. On the top six columns on bases stood at at each end, with seven on the sides. Two sides of the profiled wall-bases and the threshold of the cella are in situ. About 150 blocks from the cella walls were re-used in the Med Bourtzi Tower at Karystos and it would be possible to reconstruct most of the elevation, although the exact height is unknown, since none of the columns remained in situ. Several pediment blocks are preserved, among them those of the central tympanon. The front one shows a clipeus relief of a man holding a horse. This block is of Pentclic marblc, while for the rest of the building selected grey-white Cipollino marble from neighbouring quarries was used. Study of the ground-plan and individual elements reveals that the so-called R Temple is a mausoleum (Figs. 29, 30), dating to the mid-2nd Ct AD. Perhaps it belonged to a R aristocratic Procurator, who supervised the Imperial quarries. It lay by a perfectly straight road, ca 3km long, which ran from anc. Karystos (Palaiochora, situated N of the mod. town) to the harbour. From LC times terraced burial grounds and simple graves were built along this road, as D. Keller (SEEP) was recently able to prove. The marble mauso- leum, till now interpreted as a R Temple, was an impressive last monument on this cemetery road used for over 500 years. For arrivals, it dominated the view of the harbour with its relief-decorated facade. Katakalou. Conservation and cleaning of the tholos brought to light Myc and G sherds inside the tomb and in the dromos C pottery and a bronze coin of Euboea perhaps of the 2nd Ct BC.

A trench, 8m x 3m, opened immediately S of old Tomb 13, was found to contain three pyres as well as two tombs of which one was empty, the other (T.74) a women's burial, richly furnished. She had been provided with thirteen gold rings, two gilt bronze bracelets and a pair of earrings decorated with pendent bars, a type new to Lefkandi (Fig. 31). Among the bronze offerings were a plain bowl and several fibulae. The vases included an Attic G oenochoe and two unusual pedestalled skyphoi (Fig. 32) which appear to be imports though their source is as yet uncertain. With these were a handmade incised doll (resembling that previously found, Palia Perivolia T.22,30) and a unique small figurine of a tortoise in the same fabric (Fig. 33). The square at the E extremity of the cemetery, immediately E of pyre 23, partly excavated last year, was further explored and was found to contain a further three tombs, two of considerable size and depth but with few offerings. A much smaller LPG burial (Tomb 71) held sixteen vases, mostly of known types. The discovery of these further burials underlines the difficulty of detecting tomb cuttings in the local conglomerate when they have a similar refill. It also throws some doubt on areas apparently blank further to the N. Levelling work for a proposed building at the NE edge of Xeropolis had revealed a very large cist tomb which was subsequently robbed. The Ephorate invited the School to take part in an emergency dig to investigate the tomb and indica- tions of another adjacent cist. The latter turned out to be a probable short side entrance and, like the cist itself, was devoid of finds, though pottery from the surrounds suggest a MH date for the burial." In 1987 in private hands in Basiliko there was found a Fig. 30 collection of objects from here including a Myc Phi figurine, a stirrup jar, part of an LH IIIC krater, and EH vessels. The collection also contained architectural fragments, HL items and a grave stele inscribed TIMODQ2N (IAOAHMOY. (ADelt 42 Chr, 214) Loutra Aidepsou. The work on the R bath complex (AR 1991- 92, 33, 1992-3, 39) was completed. The N room of the W building was cleared and this whole section of the complex excavated in detail. Clear evidence of a second storey was found; the building was tile-roofed with a slab floor to the upper storey. In the N room (A) were three unfluted columns and an ECh column capital. Pottery from the lower floor consisted of domestic and practical wares but from the upper floor came lamps, a bronze vessel handle, glass and coins (not identifiable). Room 0 formed the main entrance to the building with a series of eight steps and possibly the base of an internal stair at the SW corer; room K contained an oven from secondary usage, but no evidence for its original use.

The area excavated on Chrysanthe- mon was given a comprehensive grid which would make future coordination of evidence much more systematic. In 1986-7 excavation was carried out in 11 squares, revealing 14 rooms of five different complexes, very important evidence of the late EH settlement. One roadway paved with pebble and shell leads towards the sea, two others separate complexes. The buildings are preserved to only 1-3 courses of masonry but give evidence notably in Building II of being two-storeyed. Many compari- sons to the contemporary excavated sites on the mainland are noted; the finds too were impressive (as previously from this site) comprising good evidence of pottery, domestic utensils and unusual items, e.g. an askoid vessel with parallels at Troy and a Cycladic animal figurine. No evidence of destruction by fire was noted in this area. At Exo Panagitsa 18 tombs were excavated almost all robbed. They were of typical construction, rock-cut of various shapes with black pebble floors. The finds were of high quality where preserved.

FRENCH NORTHWEST GREECE (12th Ephorate) The report for 1987 covers much rescue work by the Ephorate and work on the arrangement and improvement of the Museums at Ioannina, Arta, Nikopolis and Leukada. A number of stelai and inscriptions are recorded for Nikopolis and the interesting find from Arta of a clay disk (Di. 13.5 cm) with incised characters, thought to be cultic, of the 2nd Ct BC.

Thanks to the kindness of the Ephor it has been possible to make use of local press releases for important new information from the 1993 season. Actium. In 1993 W.M. Murray of the ASCS began a cooper- ative underwater survey, entitled the Actium Project, with the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology, at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf. He reports: "The Project's long-range goals are two-fold: to compile a record of submerged cultural artifacts at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf, and to record evidence relevant to the battle of Actium, fought here in 31 BC. An area adjacent to the Preveza Peninsula was selected for our initial survey by sidescan sonar in the region where we believe the anc. battle fleets first engaged. First an appropriate section of the Greek hydrographic chart of the area (scale 1:50,000) was scanned into a computer-readable format and then imported into a mapping program. This allowed us to convert the latitude and longitude coordinates to a system used by our satellite position- ing system. Once our base map had been generated, we overlaid a grid on it that was divided into km squares, oriented N-S, E-W. The grid divided our survey region into convenient units from which we calculated the start and stop points of each survey traverse. Each day we selected a unit of grid squares. We then calculated from our base map the latitude and longitude values for the beginning and ending points of survey lines, running parallel to each other N to S at 100m intervals. Once these 'way points' were entered into our navigational computer, we simply steered the boat according to specific directions provided by the computer. The boat's position was calculated by an extremely accurate satellite positioning system called Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). We chose this system because of its accuracy (+/- 2m) compared to GPS (+/- 50m) without the 'differential' option. The Actium Project is the first archaeological project in Greece to employ DGPS. Our sonar image was displayed on a high-resolution computer monitor and recorded (along with the latitude and longitude coordinates of the boat) in digital form on a VHS video cassette tape. The positional coordinates were also recorded directly onto a computer diskette as a backup. Because the sidescan data are recorded in digital form, the image never degrades on playback, can be copied repeated- ly, and can be processed through various digital filters to enhance the computer image. We are currently working with Dr. Maria Kalergi, a specialist in image-processing at the Moffitt Cancer Research Center (Tampa, Florida), on ways to enhance the images of our most promising targets. During the last days of our season, we reviewed the most obvious targets we had noted during the course of our survey and selected 22 for further examination. Although it is impossible to say for certain what these targets represent, some bear the characteris- tic shape of ancient shipwrecks-namely, highly reflective ovoid mounds. Other targets are hard and compact and would be appropriate for battle debris. We are currently researching known casualties from World War II that might correspond to this debris. Because we believe that 60-90 bronze warship rams were lost during the Battle of Actium, we would like to establish an effective method of locating bronze under water. To this end, we tested a large metal detector commercially used to find buried pipelines and copper-clad cables. We hoped this device would detect traces of metal debris (like shields, helmets, swords) lost in the area where the two battle fleets engaged. After repeated tests, we concluded that the detector was unsuited to the rocky terrain of our survey area. Our search continues for a more effective device. In 1993, our sidescan survey provided the best results. During the 16 days of our survey, we covered a linear distance of 324kms for a total of 32 sq.kms, or roughly 30% of our designated survey area. We found two distinct zones in this region. Zone 1 extends from a shore to a depth of 35-45m. It is characterized by a highly reflective, rocky bottom that is obscured in many places by thick patches of Posidonia grass. Zone 2 occurs seaward of Zone 1, is relatively flat, and is characterized by a sandy bottom. Because of its low reflectivity and lack of Posidonia grass, all of our targets were identified in Zone 2. Unfortunately, because of the depths involved, we were unable to investigate our targets with SCUBA. This task remains to be carried out next year with a submersible video camera mounted on an ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle). Thus during the 1993 season, we success- fully recorded submerged features appropriate to shipwrecks and battle debris in the region of the Battle of Actium. Whether these features represent artifacts from the ancient period or not must await further investigation." The press showed considerable interest in this project, e.g. Ethnos 25.7.93, Nea 23.8.93 &amp; 3.1.94, Kathemerine 30.11.93; a cautionary warning against hyberbole from the Archaeologi- cal Council is reported by Ethnos 19.5.94. Arta (AR 1992-93, 41-2). For 1987, 21 excavations are reported which produced further evidence of the city plan (with grid of avenues and streets with a sidewalk and drains), the city wall and the W and S cemeteries. EEC funding allowed three additional staff to be employed, as well as a fourth who supervised all the work on the new sewage system in the town. The state of preservation differed widely and many areas were almost irretrievably disturbed by Byz and postByz building and pits. In the Lambrakes plot on Kyprou, four HL houses faced outwards in opposite directions to known streets with a drain in the middle between the two sets of houses. Here occupation was attested from A to LHL, with clear evidence of C in some places; G sherds give important evidence of the extent of the Corinthian colony. Finds from this plot were of high quality and included a complete HL female statue in bronze. The site was overlaid by a massive later wall, possibly a fortification wall for the city. In the Tachou-Miller plot on Kommenou, in spite of difficulties from ground water and the traces of anc. flooding, the start of the Sacred Way with a small plateia outside the gate was cleared. Other interesting finds included a LHL pebble mosaic with thunderbolts in diamonds and rows of small motifs. On Arachthou below HL houses was an earlier 5th Ct phase constructed of conglomerate. The major new discovery came to light at the centre of the anc. city, when the pavement was being renewed between the church of Ag. Theodora and the gymnasium to the W. Unfortunately the area available for excavation was restricted, but a long N-S wall appeared near the surface built of big rectangular blocks.</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 Fig. 35 At the N were two dining rooms in excellent condition; S of these was an extensive area of as yet unknown dimensions.

Finds included a HL female statue, many tiles and architectural members (notably a HL Ionic capital), coins, HL pottery and high-quality 5th Ct BC rf kraters one showing Apollo playing the lyre. It is suggested that the building is the Prytaneion dating to the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. The sewage works produced from the S cemetery 11 pithos burials of the 6th Ct BC and a further 82 graves, mainly cists but a few tile-covered, dating from then until the 2nd Ct AD.

The article empha- sizes the importance of this roadway, its width and impressive appearance and the richness of the tombs by it, with the very large number of inscribed stelai. The remains date from the 6th Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD but the route must have been in use a century or so earlier.

Some 2.5km S of the city on the National Road to Prebeza an extensive (28 x 17m) R structure, almost certainly a bath complex, was discovered by accident and then excavated in 1987. Three large and two small rooms, and a cistern were cleared, with walls of brick, tile and stone with lime mortar. Finds included an under-lifesize statue of Dionysos, fine wares, a marble column drum and a hoard of 50 worn bronze coins. (ADelt 42 Chr, 318-9) Professor J.R. Wiseman (ASCS) reports: "The Nikopolis Project is engaged in multidisciplinary archaeological research conducted jointly by Boston University and two Greek archae- ological ephorias. The Project has as its broad, general aim the explanation of the changing relationships between humans and the landscape they inhabited and exploited in S Epirus, from earliest prehistoric times through the Med period. the Project takes its name from the R imperial urban center of the region. Archaeological Diachronic Survey: The total of 122 tracts were surveyed and 34 sites and scatters (SS) were designated in 1993. Additional areas were surveyed less intensively and have been designated walkovers, beginning this year. That designation is also used for return visits to sites previously surveyed, if new observations are made. A total of 65 walkovers were designated. Most of the tracts, sites/scatters, and walkovers surveyed were in the three areas on which the Project focused its research efforts this year: the Ag. Thomas peninsula, including the area around the Ormos Vathy at its W end; the larger region of Michalitsi; and the Acheron River valley. In all these, and in other areas, there were significant discoveries.</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 1 *i * Fig. 39 Ag. Thomas Peninsula and Ormos Vathy: The area N and NW of Ormos Vathy showed evidence of intense human activity both in historical and PR times. The five sites designated (SS93-1,2,3,7 and 17) had material primarily from R and late antique times, which was also common in the tracts surveyed. The cultural material observed and collected is of a kind appropriate to villas or farmsteads and their storage facilities. The pattern of visible cultural material of R times corresponds well with the geological indications of the two arms of the bay that extended to the NE and NW. Although many of the flint tools found in the survey of these areas could well belong to historical times also, many were of distinctive types known in the Pal and later PR periods. One of the most significant contributions of the year in terms of historical geography is the confirmation of long-held suspicions that one of the harbours of Nikopolis lay somewhere on the shore of the Ormos Vathy (Cassius Dio 51.12 only makes clear that the harbour was on the Ambracian Gulf). Project survey teams have now documented the existence of a large town along the W side of the bay near its S end. The harbour town, SS93-8, occupies a strip of land about 250m wide and extending some 900m along the W shore almost to the military base at the N edge of Preveza. Within this area 18 tracts and five activity areas (including a midden of shells used to manufacture purple dye) were surveyed, and five walkovers were recorded. All periods of R imperial times and late antiquity are represented in the great amount of material observed and collected, including potsherds from fine and coarse wares, lamp fragments, glass, worked stone, and a marble inscription (Inv. no. 1-931S). The last item has well- cut Gr letters probably dating to the 2nd or early 3rd Ct. Massive walls of brick and waterproof concrete, most of which had been bulldozed from a field to the very edge of the bay, are located near the causeway that leads to Margarona. Other structures are indicated by building debris in various parts of the site or suggested by geophysical prospection. At Margar- ona itself (SS93-24), where R architectural remains have always been visible, and in general along the E side of the bay, survey was almost impossible because of the intensive develop- ment of the area (resort hotel, tavernas, fenced properties, etc.) in mod. times. Survey in the E portion of the peninsula resulted in the discovery of three sites of the R period (all in the area of Lake Pogonitsa, probably a harbour at that time); two of the LBA; a few Pal scatters; and the first Meso site noted in S Epirus. The Meso tools occur in a small hollow by the fort at Turko- vouni, and Karimali has identified N (especially Late and Final N) materials from the same area. Some of the stone tools, now classed as of unknown date, however, are likely to be from historical times, as was a gun flint of the 17th-19th Ct. Preliminary analysis was carried out by Runnels on the more than 1,000 lithics collected from the Ag. Thomas peninsula. He notes that there are many distinctive Mid Pal materials from around the Ormos Vathy region, including Levallois cores and flakes, and Mousterian points. Michalitsi Region: Erosion may be observed throughout the area, and it is likely that many of the sherds and tiles on slopes were deposited there by washing down from eroded elevations. Although it is difficult to assess at this time the intensity of human activity in this region, it is clear that there was wide- spread occupation during both PR and historical times. The largest settlement of the region so far discovered is located in a rolling landscape of Kouveli (SS93-12), below and to the S of the highest elevation. The land descends in stages to the SE to the cemetery with the family plot marked by the lion monument discovered in 1974 by Dakaris lying in Marathia at the base of the hill. The cemetery must lie along a road that descended from the settlement and extended through the valley, probably reaching the Ambracian Gulf to the E of the Mazoma. The settlement and the cemetery both date to C and HL times, as attested by numerous potsherds, roof tiles, conical terracotta loomweights, lamp fragments, and other objects. A metal working facility was located within the town. Some R and late antique sherds, as well as part of an Ott pipe, indicate later activity at the site. A small, outlying settlement (SS93-12) was recognized ca 350m S of the peak of 43</page><page sequence="42">44 E.B. FRENCH Kouveli. Here, too, the surface material indicates a mix of residential and industrial activity ranging over the same time periods, but adding a BA sherd. Numerous other burials of the same time periods have been noted over the years in the vicinity: along the ridges of Koukos and Palaiosteno, and further to the N in Nerantzies. They lie along the line of the mod. road, which local inhabitants tell us was part of the main road from Preveza to Ioannina during the Turkokratia; it is likely to mark the line of an anc. road, at least in part. Survey in the area of the cemetery where the lion monument is located (SS93-19) produced relatively little material, most of it R in date. A few other sites were ident- ified, probably farmsteads, both of C/HL and R periods. Acheron River Valley: The study of anc. literature, accounts of other scholars who have worked in the area, and our own archaeological and geologic investigations in 1992 informed the decision to concentrate most of our survey efforts in this area during 1993 on the hills and ridges that surround Fanari Bay, known as Glykys Limni in antiquity. The survey was combined with additional geological survey and coring. While additional analysis is needed in the laboratory and further testing of hypotheses next year, it seems likely that much of that part of the broad plain N of the lower Acheron was formed in recent times by longshore deposition, leaving readily visible, large concentric semicircles marking the accretionary beaches. The bay, in other words, extended deep into the current landscape, some three to four kms. Six long tracts (T93-105, 106, 111,112,113) walked across the fossil beaches resulted in a total count of only 25 artifacts. On the elevations around the bay, the results were vastly different. On the peak of the promontory SW of Alonaki Beach, a structure of polygonal masonry (possibly a tower) was discovered and HL ceramics recovered from a looter's trench within it (SS93-30). BA pottery was also found downslope to the SE. The important Mid-Upper Pal site of Spilaion (SS92- 37) was surveyed intensively, including a tightly gridded total pickup in one of the areas of high concentration of lithics. The latter will be used to determine if there is a pattern to the location of different types of lithics material. Several tracts and walkovers showed that the PR lithics extended over the entire hill. There were also scattered sherds of the LBA and post-Med period. Survey in and around Valanidorrachi also resulted in the discovery of hundreds of lithic flakes and tools in red Pleistocene deposits (especially W93-76), BA pottery, and evidence of activity both in the ER period and late antiquity. There are extensive remains of the C/HL period, late antiquity, late Med, and post-Med on the long ridge we have designated Ag. Eleni (SS93-18), after the moder church near its N end. A polygonal masonry encloses the hill near its base, and a second wall of the same construction surrounds the high point of the ridge (Axoutis), where there is a geodetic marker (118m ASL). The wall on the ridge is preserved in one area in six courses to a height of 2.2m. Hammond mentions only the upper wall, and comments on the later cistern within the fortification. A wall of smaller stones set in mortar runs along the ridge below the larger polygonal wall, and may be Med in date. Other dry stone walls of uncertain date also occur on the ridge, and there are numerous fallen architectural blocks. Artifacts indicate occupation during the BA, HL, late antiquity, Med, and post-Med. Other Areas: The Project undertook, at the request of the Ephorate, the recording of a portion of the R aqueduct that had been partially destroyed by recent construction at the S edge of Kanali in the region known as Vrysi tis Kyras. Another section of the aqueduct recently exposed in a road cut at the W edge of Oropos was also documented, and tracts were surveyed there and in the vicinity of a nearby polygonal structure, probably a HL watch tower. Tracts were also surveyed in the area of Frangoklisia, where the Ephorate is cleaning a large R architectural complex (previously known). Survey was also briefly undertaken in the vicinity the Myc Tholos T at Kiperi near Parga (W93-40, 77). Geophysical Survey: Geophysical survey is used in the Nikopolis Project primarily to investigate selected areas that are particularly appropriate for geophysical prospection where surface survey has suggested significant human activity. The aim here is to provide evidence for or against correlation between cultural material on the surface and subsurface features that might be detected by geophysical survey. We consider it an important supplement to surface survey. Geophysical prospection is also used to address specific problems at known sites: e.g., delimit industrial or other specific activity areas. Kilns and metal works are especially susceptible to this kind of investigation. In 1993 Professor John Weymouth headed a geophysical survey team that worked at five localities. Grammeno (SS92-6): This site, where over 35,000 artifacts were counted on the surface this year (T93-1), was selected to determine if any large structures might be associated with the surface material. Proton magnetometers, electromagnetic conductivity, and electrical resistivity were the techniques employed. Two probable structures in different survey blocks and a linear feature, all oriented on the same diagonal to the traverses, were detected. Strongyli: Survey was undertaken here to aid in the investigation now being initiated by the Ephorate. Magnetome- ter and resistivity surveys in the area of the plundered graves resulted in the location of probable tombs. (Magnetometer survey in the area of the olive presses proved not to be helpful because of the shallowness of soil and the numerous rocks in the area). Kouveli (SS92-12): Survey here was particularly useful in identifying the locations of strong magnetic anomalies in the fields where several pieces of slag were found. The likelihood is high that a metal working area within the C/HL settlement would be found if excavation were carried out were the anomalies occurred. The Harbour Town at Ormos Vathy (SS93-8): Most of the survey data must still be analyzed, but preliminary analysis indicates a possible structure and iron anomalies. At the fifth site, the lion monument in Marathia (SS93-19), no convincing evidence of the road was detected. Prospection by radar (not used this year) might be more successful and is being planned for next year. Geological Coring and Survey: On the basis of the 1992 results, the 1993 geologic coring for the Nikopolis project was undertaken to further reveal Holocene subsurface stratigraphy and to reconstruct the changing coastline and evolving land- scape. The coring operation was carried out by Zhichun Jing (University of Minnesota) and Rick Dunn (University of Delaware). A total of 22 cores were drilled to a maximum depth of 13m using a hand-operated auger. In order to drill long cores on sandy barriers and beach ridges, casing tubes were employed. All cores were described and logged in detail on standard forms that are a part of the Project archives. In addition, geological and soil surveys were conducted at three archaeological sites (Grammeno, Ormos Vathy, and Kouveli) to provide a basic geological context for these sites. Three soil profiles were studied and sampled at Grammeno and Ormos</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 Vathy. A total of 213 samples were collected from cores and from soil profiles for the laboratory analyses that are being performed in the Archaeometry lab at the University of Minnesota-Duluth. Pleistocene geological studies are dis- cussed below. An important additional task has been combined geological/archaeological scouting to determine areas where erosion, deep recent alluvium, or shoreline changes have hidden or obliterated traces of human activity. This kind of scouting serves to delimit further our survey area by eliminat- ing (except for test expeditions) areas where surface survey would serve no purpose. Lowland W of Mazoma Lagoon: Preliminary analysis indicates two Holocene marine transgressive-regressive sequences. The lower marine unit is found in cores about lkm from the present lagoon shore, indicating the marine trans- gression extended far beyond the middle of the lowland, and probably crossed the entire lowland and connected to the Ionian Sea. If there was a water connection between the Ionian Sea and the Ambracian Gulf during maximum trans- gression, the main water passage should be on the S side of the lowland, close to Nicopolis site. Ag. Thomas Peninsula and Ormos Vathy: Two cores were drilled on the N and S sides of lake Pogonitsa near the tip of the peninsula. Preliminary study indicates that the lake may have been a closed coastal lake or lagoon during the early Holocene, with a large opening occurring later during the high stand of marine transgression. Microfaunal study during the year and radiocarbon dating will clarify both the chronology and the issue of transgression. Two cores were drilled on the landward sides of both arms of Ormos Vathy to determine the extent and evolution of the bay. Preliminary analysis indicates the bay extended at least 800m beyond the present shore at the time of maximum Holocene transgression. Flood Plain of the Louros River and the Salaora Bar- rier: The purpose of the five cores in the W of Petra and in the plain of Grammeno was to determine the extent of marine transgressions during Holocene and possibly late Pleistocene. The sixth core on the Salaora barrier is of major significance in the analysis of marine transgressive sequences and coastal change. The cores in 1992 and 1993 together indicate the Holocene marine transgressions extended all the way to the mountain ridges, leaving at most a narrow land passage on the N. The plain of Grammeno on the other hand was not flooded by sea transgression during the Holocene because of its higher topographic profile. The site at Strongyli both during the R and HL periods may have been connected to the mainland (or at least close to it), but during the periods of maximum marine transgression would, along with Mavrovouni ridge, have been an island. Acheron River Valley: The stratigraphy revealed by a series of eight cores indicates that the maximum Holocene transgression extended at least 3kms E of the present shore, and may even have reached beyond the area of the anc. (so- called) Lake Acherousia. That is, the whole coastal plain of the lower Acheron valley was at one time flooded by the sea. Radiocarbon dating during the year will clarify the chronology, and analysis of the microfauna will determine the nature (estuarine or lacustrine) of Lake Acherousia. Pleistocene Geological Studies: Tjeerd Van Andel with Curtis Runnels and Priscilla Murray made significant contribu- tions to our understanding of the Pleistocene landscape. They had significant cooperative help, as did Jing and Dunn, from P. Paschos of the Preveza office of IGME. Van Andel and Paschos identified soil profiles of different degrees of develop- ment, and thus of different ages, at several Pal sites found in 1992 and at red beds in other areas. The soils could be dated from 100,000 years to 20,000 years ago. Pal artifacts within those soils are thus provided with rough dates that will be refined by further analysis. The study of red beds was advanced significantly by the hypothesis developed by van Andel regarding their origins and history. He believes they were formed in shallow basins created by local faulting, and the drainage was blocked by clays eroding from surrounding limestone elevations. They would from time to time (probably annually) have filled temporarily with water, which would eventually evaporate. These features are being called 'dolines' for the time-being while van Andel develops a more specific terminology for the phenomenon. Runnels and van Andel further speculate that these seasonal lakes may help explain the distribution of Mid Pal sites. That is, they are likely to have attracted the attention of hunters/gatherers because of the availability there of raw materials and perhaps other resources. Aerial Photography from a Tethered Blimp: Because of various delays only one flight with the tethered blimp for aerial photography was made. The site chosen was the HL fortified town at Palaiorophoros. The flight, using helium instead of hydrogen for safety, was successful in every way, and excellent photographs were taken. Conclusions and Observations: The importance of interdis- ciplinary research to achieve the Project's aims was particularly pointed up this summer in every area of our investigations. The framing of questions regarding the interaction of humans with this changing landscape (our overall aim) has involved the constant intellectual interaction of geologists, physicists, historians, and archaeologists, drawing also on anc. literature. The analysis of the patterns of settlement and of land use is also being significantly aided by the use of satellite imagery and computer-aided mapping and statistical analysis. the significance of the results of the Project lies, as we had hoped from the beginning, more with the integrated view of changing patterns of land exploitation, and the changing land itself, than with any single discovery of site or material." Paliopyrgos Pogoniou. At Plasi, ca. lkm from Palioura, excavation took place in 1987 on a large tumulus-like structure. Once the heavy ground cover had been removed remains of graves appeared almost on the surface. Nine cists were cleared, one BA (11th Ct BC) with two handmade PR pots and 10 of the 5th Ct AD of the so-called 'Slav' type similar to those known from Merope (AR 1992-93, 43). (ADelt 42 Chr, 307-8) Prebeza: Ag. Thomas. On the track to the Pogonitsa lagoon a PR cist grave with two burials, heavy handmade pottery and bronze jewellery was discovered by accident in 1987. This gives important new evidence of the extent of PR settlement in the area. (ADelt 42 Chr, 319) Philippias (AR 1992-93, 46). P. Vokotopoulos publishes his work in 1990 in PAE 160-4 and reports on his work in 1993 in Ergon 58-61 on the monastery church of the Pantanassa, an important monument of the Despotate. With the use of a crane the fallen blocks and masonry were removed from the building itself and placed in good order to the side. Traces of 13th Ct AD fresco were revealed on the arches. Excavation was then possible at the N and S of the narthex; finds included many pieces of the decorative marble slabs (mainly white but some coloured), a fragment of fresco with a male head, and brick with maeander and other decorative patterns, including one inscribed. Excavation in the field outside the main structure 45</page><page sequence="44">46 E.B. FRENCH Fig. 40 revealed a wall similar to the N parekklesion with a niche. In the SE corer of the foundation was mortar from the vault compacted with twigs. This would indicate that this wall was built after the collapse of the W stoa, where such material was used (or that unused material from the stoa was employed). The floor of the main church has now been completely cleared and restored with catch pits for drainage. Consolidation was also carried on the N stoa and elsewhere. Plaision Malakasiou. A tomb enclosure came to light in 1993 of HL date (end 3rd/beginning 2nd Ct BC) with handsome stelai; one gives the name (AMIAAQ EIMIA) (Fig. 40).

Further work on an exten- sive scale in 1987 revealed two adjacent deposits, the first the one with architectural remains partially cleared earlier, and the other with Laconian tiles and iron nails from a wooden structure, presumably both from the roof of the same building, the exact site of which has not yet been determined. (ADelt 42 Chr, 265-6) Agrapha. The finds of 180 tombs and a funerary monument in two cemeteries assigned to anc. Agritheia is reported in Rizospastes 4.5.94. Alonnesos. Further reports of work on this important wreck appear in Kathemerine 25.7.93, Mesembrine 23.8.93, Paron 9.1.94, Nautemporike 29.5.94 and passim 17.5.94. Belestino (anc. Pherai). In 1987 the Ephor, A. Intzesiloglou, and her staff conducted a series of rescue excavations (10 reported) which throw important light on the history of this notable city. Particularly important is the evidence for the extent of the settlement in different periods. The earliest occupation noted was MBA and all periods were recorded down to HL, followed and often disturbed by Ott. The Myc town can be shown to have extended further than previously known on the NE of the anc. town with structures of LH IIIA (A2 as illustrated); a kiln in good condition was found on the NW bounds of the mod. town. In this plot were also two children's cist graves, probably PG, and an ordered area of the PG cemetery (burials of both adults and children) came to light on Alkestes near the centre of the anc. town. Here was a rare A building, possibly a house, but also with evidence of bronze working and two pottery kilns associated with large pieces of painted pottery. On the S side of Kastraki the A levels lay on the natural rock with no earlier occupation. A further stretch of the SE section of the anc. city wall came to light near the crossing of R. Pheraiou and Ag. Konstantinou. From the C period came two 5th Ct pottery kilns on Admetou and various walls of good construction in contrast to the preceding and succeding periods. What is notable throughout is the swift succession of one phase on another, without change of align- ment, using the previous structure as the foundation of the next. A HL roadway was found on Str. Iatride and there were various 4th Ct and HL structures in several plots; in two on the S of the anc. town there were no underlying levels. One of these produced stamped Laconian tiles: XAPIEENOY, FOPFIAOY, MENQNIAOY, KAEOAHMOY and a small marble stele inscribed AITOMAXA/ EPMAOY. In the uppermost levels on Alkestes was evidence of an Ott iron workshop. A marble grave stele of the mid 5th Ct BC, showing a man and a boy, was handed in to the authorities, while local school children discovered an EHL marble stele at Chloe from the site of the temple of Zeus 'Thaulios', bearing the inscrip- tion AITOA/ MOIPAIlF/ TPOYAII/ ONEBEIK. (ADelt 42 Chr, 255-61, 270-1) Demetriada (anc. Demetrias) (AR 1992-93, 47). Tombs 78- 155 of the cemetery at Soros are published in outline. They range in date from the 6th to the 3rd Ct BC. Another LR tomb of the S cemetery with six burials is reported in 1987, while from the N cemetery the driver of a bulldozer handed in a considerable number of finds made while working on the sewage system. Part of the cemetery of earlier Pagasai came to light in another plot with EC material (bf et al.) including two limestone sarcophagi. A HL structure came to light on Athenon-N. Pagases with a long external wall and four rooms; in the plot of El. Gkoutzine a series of levels ran from Myc (heavy unpainted and handmade wares), high quality C mater-</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 ial, HL with West Slope ware, lamps, figurines and coins, to an ER structure of three rooms with a bothros and much domestic ware amid burning. From a plot assigned for a TV station, came evidence of HL occupation in two phases with prolific pottery, and below part of the Myc settlement of Pefkakia with LH IIIA2 and IIIB material. More of the retaining wall of the stadium came to light on Kyprou and Zerba, with rectangular indentations presumably for wooden pilasters. The whole length of the stadium had remained visible until some 30 years ago. A major effort of the Ephorate was in the theatre, to prepare for possible moder usage. In the orchestra the whole floor was cleared to determine the period and nature of the last use, apparently to be assigned to the 4th Ct AD. A pebble floor was found and a stone with iron ring in the centre; other stones and bases of various uses also appeared. Test trenching on the periphery uncovered the drain, topped with slabs to match the seating. A stratigraphic test was too restricted for useful result. A ramp and a retaining wall were found associated with the N parodos and considerable evidence of the building sequence; in the S parodos a level of the end of the 2nd/beginning of the 1 st Ct BC produced two Doric half capitals, probably from the original proscaenium, and an inscription of the 1st quarter of the 2nd Ct BC concerning the dress of the 'Hunters of Herakl- es'. (ADelt 42 Chr, 246-54, 270) Dimini. In two sessions in 1987, V. Adryme-Sismane for the Ephorate conducted excavations in a plot on the E slope of the mound just outside the archaeological area, to test the presence of Myc layers here and if possible obtain information on levels earlier than those already known. Though the remains had been disturbed by ploughing, low foundations of double walls with central fill were found, belonging to an extensive complex related to that from adjacent plots. The pottery found was mainly monochrome, but the painted wares (thought to be local on the basis of the clay) are assigned to LH IIIB2-C1. A handsome LH IIIA2 stemmed krater from room 9 is illustrated, with large schematic birds and filled panels un-antithetically arranged. Small finds were few but typical. Positions where tests for earlier levels could be made were hard to find, but one trial produced underlying levels with LH IIIA2/B1 pottery. (ADelt 42 Chr, 245-6) Ermetsi. Rescue excavation in 1987 disclosed a HL water channel on the N side of the town by the Church of the Zoodochos Pege. (ADelt 42 Chr, 262) Halos. Excavation by the Dutch Institute under R. Reinders continued in 1993 on the Hellenistic town. Work in previous seasons had shown that the town was divided into 64 blocks of the same width (31.5m) but different lengths (187.5 and 220m have been recorded). In each block are two rows of plots of the same depth but varying frontage (15m, 13.75m and 12.5m have been recorded). The 1993 work concentrated on plot 9 of block 6.4 which had a frontage of 15m. The plot divides into a courtyard and a dwelling consisting of one large and two small rooms on the W and a further three on the E. As throughout the town, only one occupation level was found, with the floor covered with the items left behind by the owners. On top of these was a layer of tiles and above this earth with very few stones. It thus seems certain that the upper walls were of mudbrick though the foundations were of stone. The finds on the floor included amphoras, many pithoi, metal objects (tools and nails) as well as shells and animal bones (sheep/goat, cattle and deer). Coins of nine mints were found: Halos, Locris, Thebes, Peuma, Larisa Kremaste, and of Ptolemy II. These give an occupation date of 300-265 BC. The desertion was apparently due to earthquake. Kalliphoni. A cist grave found by chance in 1987 contained imported and local bg ware of the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC. Over the middle of the dead man were poorly preserved clay plaques with representations of a deer, a horse, and griffon and the head of Athena in an Attic helmet. At Mauroneria, some 300m from the as yet unidentified site, seven tombs (five tile, one cist, one pithos) came to light near the two known tumuli. The pottery can be dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC and one of the cover tiles was inscribed XTPATInnO[Y] and XTPAT[InnOY]. (ADelt 42 Chr,, 267-8, 269) Kallithero (AR 1992-93, 47). Part of what is interpreted as one side of the city wall came to light in the digging of foundations in 1987; the small area cleared did not allow positive identifi- cation. In the E cemetery area a clay sarcophagus was found containing a bg kantharos, two small handless cups and a shallow ladle of the 3rd Ct BC. In a plot near the E section of the city wall a N-S road with buildings on both sides appeared for the first time, at right angles to those previously identified. A destruction level of the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC is dated by coins. Finds included storage pithoi with grain and olives and a heap of loom weights. Evidence for this destruction level was also found in another plot where there were found, in a court, three clay bathtubs and Laconian tiles inscribed AHMO- XIA and AAMOXIA, indicating that this structure comprised a public bath. At Xynobryse some two km SE of the village, road-work brought to light a child burial in a jar and the remains of a tile-covered tomb (dated by scattered coins to the 4th Ct AD). A cist tomb had been previously destroyed, but the slabs were rescued along with fragments of R glass vessels. The site is thought to be the cemetery of a small settlement as yet not certainly identified. (ADelt 42 Chr, 266-7) Karla. A lecture on the PR and subsequent settlement in the Lake area is reported in Eleutherotypia 26.1.94. Kato Ktimene. Pottery including West Slope ware and two glass unguentaria were handed in in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 272) Kedros (AR 1992-93, 47). The excavation of the shrine continued for a third season in 1987. On the N side a long wall with buttress is probably the temenos wall. A pit with Laconian tiles from a destruction was overlaid by burnt animal bones, showing that the shrine continued in use after the destruction. Remains were in very bad condition on the S side and the E-W structure could not be further elucidated. Finds were as previously including clay protomes but a gold coin of Amphi- polis may be noted. Some 400m NE of the settlement a group of 63 tombs of all kinds are probably part of an organised cemetery; nearer lay a R cist tomb robbed in antiquity but containing fragments of burnt bone and glass. The chance find of a marble dedicatory stele to Apollo of the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC is reported inscribed -----]XOEONOXTEIOl/ IEPHT]- EYZAZAnAOYNI. Through local enterprise the finds are being conserved locally and will be displayed on site. Test excavation before a road was opened to the S at a spot where walls were visible revealed three houses on a slope supported by strong E outer walls; they had rough stone foundations, doubtless supporting a mudbrick superstructure (not preserved). After occupation of the 2nd half of the 5th Ct to the 1st half of the 4th there is a destruction level which 47</page><page sequence="46">48 E.B. FRENCH seems to have occurred after the buildings had been cleared out. It is suggested that the settlement was abandoned in favour of the fortified city nearby. PG sherds attested earlier occupa- tion. (ADelt 42 Chr, 268-9, 271-2) Kokkina. The marble stele published IG IMX2 #397, which was thought to be lost, came to light in the grounds of the church from which it was originally reported; a new reading is given: ArTopeifovTo; 'roi ' AoKaccl/roi Zoutolt TtLIouv£I- oi/ Etivv6; 09ioti Zorm)po[;]/ vacat. It would seem to be an unfinished decree. (ADelt 42 Chr, 271) Kyra-Panagia Alonnesou. A group of seven LR pots were found hidden in the bushes by the anchorage at Lechouni on this uninhabited island; from their condition they must come from the sea, presumably a wreck. They included five whole amphoras, one broken one of a different type and a one- handled vessel. (ADelt 42 Chr, 271) Melina. In 1987 a headless female LHL statue of the Heraklei- otissa type (unworked behind) was handed in to the authorities. (ADelt 42 Chr, 270) Mitropole. In 1987 a series of structures dating from LHL to LR came to light in excavation in a plot where the owner knew that stone had been recovered for use in the present building (constructed in 1927, according to an inscription). On the W of the town where a gymnasium was to be built there came to light R architectural remains. Although neither the size nor the use could be determined, the presence of a structure of this date gives evidence of the expansion of the town at this period. Nearby was an empty tile-covered tomb. (ADelt 42 Chr, 263) Mouzaki (archaeological area of Gomphoi). Following the finding of architectural remains in ploughing in 1986, excava- tion was carried out the following year, which brought to light a R house of several rooms and a storage area. Parallel with the NW wall was a long and broad LHL wall with roadway (four relayings) on one side. A LR tile-covered tomb was found just below the surface overlying these features. Along the bed of the Pamisos, locally called the Blioures, seven tombs of the S cemetery have come to light at various times; no dates are suggested. (ADelt 42 Chr, 264-5) Nea Anchialos (Phthiotic Thebes). During sewage work on Liakopoulou-Eulogemenou in 1987, the N section of a circular structure came to light and an intact skyphos with pendant semicircles. Subsequent excavation revealed a tholos tomb 3m in diameter. A thick layer of burnt material containing human and animal bones, as well as pottery, covered the floor. The finds included pottery, bronze jewellery, iron weapons and a gilt hair ornament. Below were four intact burials. The tholos was in use from sub PG to LG (900-750 BC) (ADelt 42 Chr, 255) Excavations and extensive conservation work continued in 1987 (AR 1992-93, 48). Excavation of the baptistery of Basilica I (4th Ct AD) was completed, and three building phases confirmed. All of what remains of the 6th Ct mosaic of the Archbishop Petros' basilica was uncovered. Remains of at least 10 building phases were found after excavations (last undertaken in 1968) of the secular building below the so-called 'acropolis of Pyrasos'. Tombs, drainage systems, cisterns and inscriptions were uncovered throughout the site. The latter include an R funerary stele with a curse demanding that anyone who opens the tomb pay 550 denaria to the treasurer: KOnPIA OIAHTO TO/ IAIQ ANAPI MNIAZ XA/PIN TIX AN AAI TO A/ MILI ANYEAI TON O/ TADON TOYTON A/ Q £I TO TAIMIQ/ *TN. A 1.85m stretch of the anc. wall of Phthiotic Thebes was uncovered on Pyrasou. The N-W corer of the 'Bishop's Palace' was also discovered. (ADelt 42 Chr, 300-4) A. Dina for the late P. Lazarides publishes the work of 1990 in PAE 142-59. Petroto (Liaskovo): Pournarakia. The cutting of a road in June 1987, followed by local intervention, disclosed a group of five cist tombs with a considerable number of typical finds, part of the cemetery of the city of the Athamanoi which lies on the adjacent hill. On the basis of coins they date to the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 42 Chr, 263-4) Philia: Magoula Tragana. After illicit bulldozing of this mound excavation revealed a Byz structure (containing some spolia) under a heavy overburden. (ADelt 42 Chr, 269-70) Prodromos: Bourntenia (AR 1992-93, 47). In a third season of work in 1987 on the shrine, eight test trenches were dug; another unit (A) came to light with walls incorporating pieces of Laconian tiles. Some 6m to the W was a deposit with many offerings: rough clay riders, seated goddesses with a high polos, and handmade kernoi. (ADelt 42 Chr, 269) Pyrgos Kieriou. A complete pithos was recovered in 1987 during the excavation of a bothros. Walls and other remains of the anc. town came to light in deep ploughing which was followed by rescue excavation. (ADelt 42 Chr, 262-3) Skopelos. The discovery of the 12 Ct AD wreck by the Underwater Ephorate is reported in Kedros 21.7.93 et al. Loutraki (anc. Selinounta). In 1987 two parallel R structures came to light in the middle of the R town which extends SE from the C acropolis; one incorporated a rectangu- lar vaulted cistern. A breakwater was installed to save what remains of the R baths from wave action; the visible remains were recorded. (ADelt 42 Chr, 261-2) Thrapsimi: Kastro. This previously unknown walled settle- ment was identified in 1987 on a hill dominating the surround- ings. An inner wall divides the town on the E slope from the acropolis. Rock cuttings for a substantial tower are visible on the summit. From the style of construction the walls can be dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct or the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC. The function of this site can be considered in relation to the other similar adjacent sites which would have guarded the passes of the Agrapha Mountains but allowed intercommunication. Volos: Nea Ionia (AR 1992-93, 48). The discovery in 1987 of 99 tombs, some 500m from the Kastro in the back of the Krausidona, is reported. They consisted of 23 G, rich in finds, 26 A and C cists with bf etc pottery, five cists used in both G and C, five late 4th Ct, 25 without offerings and 16 undatable or disturbed with one pithos. Four other tombs are also reported: two tile-roofed tombs, one without offerings and one of HL date; a HL marble ur with burnt bones and offerings and a cist grave with two HL inscribed grave stele as walls; these read: EYTYXIAHI/ NIKOKPATOY and AnOAAQNI- 0X/ EYTYXIAOY. (ADelt 42 Chr, 254-5)</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 PHTHIOTIS (14th Ephorate) The work of the Ephorate in Eurytania continued in 1987 and in addition a Dutch team under S. Bommelje carried out a survey which yielded a total of 32 major anc. sites. (ADelt 42 Chr, 241-4) A number of inscriptions are included in the stray finds and those handed in to the Ephorate in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 239-41) The conference on the area held in Elateia in 1992 is summarized by K. Barsou in Phokika Chronika 5 (1993) 184-8. The threat of industrial development to the sites in the Sperch- eius basin, the kingdom of Achilles, is highlighted (with map) in Nea 11.2.94. The imminent opening of an Archaeological Museum in Lamia in the old barracks is reported in Kathe- merine 31.3.94. Achinos. The find of a pebble mosaic with the 16 pointed "star of Vergina" is reported in Apogeumatine 24.6.93. Ag. Ioannes Theologos. At the site lying some 300m E of anc. Halai, there came to light in 1987 groups of tombs dating from the 6th Ct BC to R times; this is probably part of the cemetery excavated by Goldman, of which the exact location was not known. Twenty-nine tombs of various types were cleared and are reported in some detail. The following in particular may be noted: traces of wood indicating coffins or biers and the inscription AIOAAQNIOE on the geison of a grave stele. In another field some 50m further away from the site of Halai there were found six HL ChTs, all long disturbed and having had their roofs removed by the bulldozer. A short list of finds is given. (ADelt 42 Chr, 228-31) Atalante. Seven investigations are reported for 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 224-8) In the D. Zekente plot (on an unnamed road in the SE of the town) a building complex came to light. The main remains date to LR (sherd evidence) with walls contain- ing both spolia and tile; a central courtyard is identified as well as rooms, some small. In two of the latter were hoards of coins (11 and seven respectively). A destruction level sealed the remains, which included a cistern and some evidence of alterations to the plan. The many small finds included the inevitable loomweights. HL sherds indicate earlier usage of the site and an ECh child grave was cut into the debris after the destruction. At Makedonika more work was done on the apparent HL fortification (AR 1992-93, 49); 340m have now been cleared without a major change of direction. The extent is not yet known but the remains on the hill to the W may be associated. Five rectangular towers exist, in one of which was a burial. At Ethnikes Antistaseos 79 three cists of children were found; the isolated find of a conulus and sherds of coarse handmade unpainted wares seem to indicate a BA date. More of the PG cemetery came to light on Demotike in Bodobatsa in the S of the town. Though some were damaged (including in antiquity) 33 tombs of varied type were excavated and reported in some detail. At 25 Martiou 93-5 two LR cist tombs were found with several burials in T I (T II was destroyed by the bulldozer). Some blocks were reused, including a marble relief slab. Finds included metal ornaments and 10 coins which are reported in detail. Barka. At Palioura some 300m E of the ECh Basilica, deep ploughing uncovered an isolated C cist tomb. In spite of previous opening both skeleton and finds (including jewelry, astragaloi and pottery) were intact. (ADelt 42 Chr, 223) Elateia (AR 1992-93, 49 with refs). Further illicit excavation made it necessary in 1987 to continue the excavation of the Myc/SMyc cemetery started in 1985. A further seven tombs (T XVI-XXII) were cleared. Burial customs etc were similar to those dug previously; finds were copious; at least four had been reused for R burials. (ADelt 42 Chr, 231-4) Ph.

A second season of excavation took place in 1987 on the LC cemetery; in three trials, 17 cist and tile graves with many typical finds, as well as three rectangular pits with the remains of pyres, came to light. (ADelt 42 Chr, 223) Golemi. Traces of two separate building complexes (undated) were noted in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 238) Halai (AR 1992-93, 49). J. Coleman (ASCS) directed a study season on the finds from his recent excavations but also reports: "We also studied the R/Byz remains. During the study of the architectural remains a tomb was noted inside the church (probably 12th or 13th Ct AD) which was in danger of being destroyed by the rain. With the permission of the Ephorate the tomb was cleaned and the skeleton removed." Kalapodi. Deep ploughing brought to light in 1987 a complete PG skyphos with pendant semicircles. Subsequent excavation revealed a small cist grave with the bones probably of a child and a complete PG amphoriskos. (ADelt 42 Chr, 235) Kompotades. About half way along the road between here and Meziates remains of a rather disturbed HL structure of at least two rooms were found during tree planting. The finds consisted of pottery, nine loomweights (four stamped), a bronze strainer, and a stone mortar. (ADelt 42 Chr, 224) Lamia. In addition to further work almost entirely on Ott remains on the Kastro, eight rescue excavations are reported for 1987. Part of the HL city wall (largely illegally destroyed) was investigated at Ploutarchou and Gkoura; this section can be related to known adjacent sections. On Karagiannopoulou on the E of the plot a section of well built HL walling may be part of the fortification; a Byz or postByz wall lay above it. The plot also produced, on the NW a square room, HL in origin but later altered, and three late tombs. Other well-built HL walls came to light in two separate plots on Patroklou, while rooms of an HL structure with clear burnt destruction level were cleared at Kolokotrone and Rozake Angele; here among many small finds some 149 loom weights may be noted. On Athanasiou Diakou sewerage work destroyed a large section of mosaic extending in all directions and probably part of one known from an adjacent plot. Further tombs of the W and S HL cemeteries were excavated: on Malieon (W cem- etery) four HL ChTs cut into the side of the Kastro of typical construction and with typical finds; on Papaphlessa and Myrmydonon there was a group of six tombs (three cist, two tile and one pit). Here T III was equipped with many offerings, notable in the NE corer an amphora with the scratched inscription: EENOKAEOYE.

A find of worked blocks in a secondary context led to the investigation of their origin but so much destruction had taken place that little could be learnt. The whole area requires much further research. (ADelt 42 Chr, 223) Periboli (AR 1987-88, 36-the source is Auge not Kathe- merine). The discovery of a Macedonian tomb in the valley of the Bistritza (anc. Inachos) already known from the press is officially reported. It had been partially destroyed but preserved some architectural detail; it remained in use from HL to R and ECh times. A preliminary account of the finds was given at the conference held in memory of D.R. Theochares in Volos in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 221-3) Syka Ypates. Construction of a football pitch in 1986 brought to light walling from roofed structures (destruction level with tile), eight graves in covered pits, pithoi of the late 4th to early 3rd Ct BC and a deposit of the 4th Ct. Nearby were blocks from a roadway and an enclosure around the church in addition to a well of Byz or postByz date. (ADelt 41 Chr, 72-4) Tragana (AR 1989-90, 48; 1990-91, 46). Two further G cist graves of the known cemetery (ADelt 36A, 1-57) were found during building work in 1986 (ADelt 41 Chr, 74). Nine further tombs (three pithoi, three cists and three poros lamakes) and a pyre of the G cemetery were excavated in 1987; they are described in detail with some illustration. Notable finds include an amber bead and anthropomorphic faience beads imported from Egypt. (ADelt 42 Chr, 235-8) Ypate. Remains of an extensive ECh structure were uncovered on the Kontogeorgiou plot (ADelt 41 Chr, 223, 42 Chr, 99). Opus mixtum masonry was faced by marble revelments. An intricate geometic pattern mosaic floor was also uncovered. Fragments of marble architectural members (colonnettes, closure panels, bases etc.) and other remains, including MByz glazed pottery, were uncovered. Zeli (AR 1985-86, 42; 1987-88, 35; 1988-89, 49). Clandestine excavation disclosed in 1985 another definite ChT and traces of another in the known Myc cemetery; they were largely without finds. (ADelt 40 Chr, 171-3) A further three tombs were excavated in 1986, of less typical type, with some finds from the earlier interments. (ADelt 41 Chr, 68) An eigth Myc ChT came to light in 1987 after illicit excavation. Finds were similar to those of previous years. (ADelt 42 Chr, 234) NORTHERN THESSALY (15th Ephorate) Work on the archaeological collections of the district in 1987, centrally at Larisa itself and at Trikkala, Pharsala, Gonnoi and Agia is reported in ADelt 42 Chr, 273-4. A considerable number of inscriptions were brought in to the Larisa Museum from Atrax, Klokotos (anc.

(ADelt 42 Chr, 284-9) Foreign or cooperative work in 1987 of which short reports are given (ADelt 42 Chr, 290-4) included that of the French School in the Tripolis of Perraiboi and at Ano Ktimene and that of the American School on the Palaeolithic of the Larisa area (AR 1987-88, 38). B. Helly, L. Darmezin, J.-C. Decourt, and G. Lucas of the French School continued their epigraphic survey in 1993, carrying out recording in the Museums of Larisa, Pharsala, Trikkala, Elasson, Volos and Almyros. Grevena Project. N. Wilkie (ASCS) reports: "During 1993 members of the Project continued their study of materials collected in prior field seasons. In addition the following geological studies took place: magnetic and resistivity surveys on three sites; study of soil profiles, including their magnetic resistivity and susceptibility at three sites; study of the phosph- oros content of soil horizons and colluvial layers at these same sites; mapping of two sites in order to reconstruct their topography at the time of occupation; and study of the evol- ution of the landscape at one site." Gyrtone. Twenty inscriptions with the name of anc. Mopsion on marble slabs built into the floor of a R bath are reported in Rizospastes 17.7.93. Kalambaka: Theopetra Cave (Mouta cave). ADelt 42 Chr, 703-7 (with plans) gives a preliminary account in the report of the Ephorate of Speleology of excavation by N. Kyparisse- Apostolika in this important cave. The main chamber had been in use for animals until recently and there are deep modem levels. Testing to a depth of 2.77m was carried out without the natural rock being reached. Finds belong to the typical Thessal- ian N assemblages extending just into the BA; occupation seems to have ended then but there are scattered sherds of Myc. Some structures of considerable interest occurred at the interface between pottery and prepottery levels. Small finds also were typical: stone and flint implements, bone tools, a few clay artifacts, shell and animal bone (mainly pig and sheep/goat). Eleutheros Typos 19.2.94 and Mesembrine 24.2.94 publish feature articles on the latest finds from the cave. Larisa. (AR 1992-93, 52) Work continued in 1987 on the first theatre on a restricted scale on local funding. A further plot was expropriated and the upper levels cleared, bringing to light tombs of unknown date (no finds) and Byz and postByz walls. On the second theatre, again with local funding, work was completed and theatre put into use. The main features are described; the construction can be dated to the 2nd half of the 1st Ct BC with work on the cavea continuing into early Imperial times and causing the restriction of the marble seating to the front rows. A fourth season of work on the Ag. Georg- ios cemetery (AR 1991-92, 42) revealed a further 15 tombs (briefly described). Two are dated to the end of the 5th Ct BC and several have a wide range of typical but rich finds.

The granting of permission to floodlight the monas- teries is reported in Ethnos 19.1.94. Trikkala. A trial excavation was carried out in 1987 on the large HL structure of the Asklepieion to determine its history and date. In the first building phase of the 1st half of the 1st Ct BC the walls were of sandstone with lead clamps and the floors of red and black pebbles. The building was divided into small rooms, of which one was cleared; it had a narrow entrance passage and a niche used for religious purposes. In the second phase the earlier building was radically altered and the individual rooms turned into a large single area; the floor was raised and covered with the mosaic of Lykourgos and Ambro- sia. This phase can be dated to the 2nd quarter of the 3rd Ct AD. (ADelt 42 Chr, 283-4) Zarko: Platia Magoula (AR 1990-91, 48). A further deep sounding was carried out in 1987 down to 8.20m without reaching stereo. The lowest 3m belong to MN and there is good evidence of the transition from MN to ELN. (ADelt 42 Chr, 282-3) CENTRAL MACEDONIA (16th Ephorate) The report for 1987 (ADelt 42 Chr, 349-74) overlaps not only the short press reports noted in AR 1987-88, 42-9 but also the reports published in AEMTH 1 and extensively used in AR 1988-89, 62-74. The latter are listed but not repeated here. The rescue work of the Ephorate in 1987 was assisted by grants from the Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace and from the Nomarchias. Items handed in to Museums are listed and only the most important mentioned here; analytical work by the laboratory is also listed.

Following a chance find during the digging of foundations in 1987, a group of seven pits came to light, mainly cylindrical and well-built, but one with a bulbous shape and narrow opening, for which usage as 'cold storage' is suggested. The ultimate use of all of them was as rubbish dumps and there was a fill of stone etc near the top. Sherds were mainly PG and C. The top of one was edged by a semicircular structure of C date. Elsewhere on the site were a well-built wall, resting on a thin layer of ash, and another at an angle to it, built on natural. In the space between them lay a destruction level of C date. (ADelt 42 Chr, 356) In AEMTH 5 (1991) two reports are published: K. Soueref on the rescue work by the Ephorate, largely on A and C buildings, but with more evidence for the known stratigraphy of the site (191-208); S. Andreou and K.

The large number of children's graves gives graphic documention of the death rate in antiquity. A rectangular structure enclosed four containers with cremations of EA and in secondary usage a menhir which must be connected with the PR settlement, known but not yet located. From another tomb came a lead sheet inscribed on both sides. Kalandras, anc. Mende (AR 1992-93, 54). In AEMTH 5 (1991) 303-318, I.

Nea Roda: Xerxes Canal. Work continued in 1993 under the overall direction of Professor P B. Isserlin (BSA) who reports: "The participants included a geophysical team headed by Professor S. Papamarinopoulos of the University of Patras, and a surveying team from Leeds University led by Dr J. Uren; Dr R. Jones helped to prepare the expedition but was unable to be present during fieldwork. In the light of experience gained in previous years it was decided to use different instruments for geophysical work, namely the conductivity meter, the differen- tial magnetometer, and the seismograph. Traverses were laid out near the cementery at Nea Roda; near traverse 92/5 tested in 1992; and a grid of traverses was arranged near the traverse D1-D2 first tested in 1991 and again in 1992, not far from traverse C1-C2, where results had been most promising. More detailed seismic reflection and refraction investigations were carried out with conductivity and magnetic measurements, the exact locations of which were plotted three-dimensionally by the surveying team. The data gathered in the fieldwork are to be processed in Professor Papamarinopoulos' laboratory in Patras. Some time after the conclusion of the geophysical investiga- tions, a deep core drilling was effected near travers D1-D2, not far from the highest point of the ground traversed by the canal. The work was undertaken by a drilling specialist from Athens, Mr Nezis, in the presence of Dr G. Syrides of the University of Thessalonike, who is to study the geological sequence represented. The core shows, below several meters of recent drift soil, a very thick deposit of black mud overlying sand which is probably natural. The study of the core should offer clues both concerning the history of the canal and also concerning the development of the local natural environment." Nea Skione. In AEMTH 5 (1991) 319-334, K.

Cambitoglou publishes the work of 1990 in PAE 185-97 and reports in Ergon 1993, 61-5 as well as at the annual meeting of the Institute. The work consisted of a study season and two surveys. The first was a geophysical one conducted by Dr R. Jones, in an area that had been partly excavated in previous seasons, to identify unexcavated walls and complete the plans of excavated buildings. Both electrical resistivity and magneto- metry were used. Both house walls and tombs were identified. One long wall on the S side may be part of the fortification wall of the anc. city. The second survey of the harbour area was an underwater one carried out in cooperation with the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology represented by C. Samios and N. Lianos. Following the identification of a series of ashlar blocks underwater in 1990, the 1993 season revealed a group of walls that appear to have originally been built on land; this may mean that Thucydides' description of the site needs reassessment. Evidence of a possible tower as well as two shore lines (identified by lines of beach rock) was noted. A possible poros anchor and a cannon ball, presumably from Morosini's siege in 1659, may be noted as the outstanding finds. A. Henry publishes a lead letter from here in AE 130 (1991) 65-70. Dion (AR 1992-93, 55). Three reports concerning Dion are published in AEMTH 5 (1991): D. Pantermales gives a general account of the year's work in several areas (137-44); S. Pingiatoglou reports on the sanctuary of Demeter (137-44); and G. Karadedos completes the publication of the skene of the HL theatre (145-56). The site continued to produce unique finds: a gynaecological instrument (Nea 10.12.93 &amp; Kathemerine 15.2.94 with drawing), an organ (Kathemerine 11.1 &amp; 5.2.94 the subject of a special exhibition in Athens) with a more general account in Kathemerine 31.3.94. The most recent exhibits in the site museum are featured in Nea 12.4.94. Gerakaro. Two funerary stelai from here were given to the Thessalonike Museum in 1987; one bore an inscription InAPAMONO AKAIA/ FNH AYEIMAXQ TQ/ YQ HPQI NEQ. (ADelt 42 Chr, 372-3) Kerasia. Illicit excavation in 1987 into a tumulus was followed by careful investigation. In the rubble was found a gold medallion with the portrait of a woman and a R vase. The marble cist was undamaged and contained a skeleton from head to thighs; the head rested on a 'pillow'. On the chest lay a coin of Dion of Septimius Severus. To the side of this tomb lay a tile grave from which came two small gold earrings. (ADelt 42 Chr, 358) Kitros: Louloudia (AR 1992-93, 56). Work on this section of the cemetery of Pydna was completed in 1987 with the excavation of another eight graves (all robbed) of the 5th-4th Cts BC, making in all 19 C and three R. The adjacent area was also surveyed for remains and a grave stele found. (ADelt 42 Chr, 365) Ta Nea 17.7.93 reports on important ECh finds (particularly a villa) discovered during the construction of the second railway line along the coast; it is suggested that the site is the anc. Anamon. Kochlida (AR 1991-92, 44-5). Excavations continued in 1987 in the LR/EByz complex. Further information has elucidated the various building phases of the important basilica on the site, now numbered by the excavators at five instead of their original estimation of three, of which three are prior to the 7th Ct AD (beginning in the later 5th Ct), one of the 7th and another of the llth-12th Ct following a period of decline. (ADelt 42 Chr, 411-3) Laguna (Ampelia: Koutra). A marble altar with relief panels from a secondary usage of the 3rd Ct AD was given to the Thessalonike Museum in 1987; one panel shows the figure of a woman with a dog behind her, presumably Hekate Enodia. (ADelt 42 Chr, 372) Makrygialos (AR 1992-93, 56). (N cemetery of Pydna) Work continued in 1987 on two plots and the water channel (still not completed). In plot 934 dense 5th Ct BC pits were found with steps on the long side for lowering the wooden sarcophagus. Only two graves were tiled. In plot 937, 24 tombs of the 4th Ct were excavated (23 pits, one tile and one reburial); the richest graves were those of children. Of the 27 graves located in the water channel, seven typical examples were excavated. (ADelt 42 Chr, 364-5) In AEMTH 5 (1991) 171-8, M. Mpesios reports on his work in this cemetery, describing tombs dating from the EIA (including ChT's), the 5th Ct BC and the HL period; he also publishes the two tumuli where the new tumulus B (AR 1991- 92, 45) has important finds, including the ivory decoration of a bed and bronze greaves accompanied by 4th Ct BC pottery. Excavations continued in 1987 in and around the important episcopal church (AR 1991-92, 45). The site is known from literary sources, and archaeological evidence confirms its adventures after 1204 when it was captured by the Frankish hordes. The exonarthex (larger than the church itself, measur- ing 16.40 x 3.10 m.) was uncovered, along with the outer face of the N wall. Three trenches were dug to locate the stylobate. Fill included wall-painting fragments (12th Ct AD?). A cistern, and what appears to be a house, were also discovered N of the church. A lead seal of the spatharokouvikoularios Stephan was found, with depictions of the Virgin and St. Stephen. Excavations in the agricultural plot 568 located a pottery kiln and workshop along with remains of a metal foundry and secular houses (ADelt 42 Chr, 408-11). In AEMTH 5 (1991) 179-90 E. Marke publishes the excavation of an interesting Byz inn some 180m S of the castle near the port area; it too was destroyed in 1204 by the Franks. Agiasma. Thessalonike 10.12.93 reports the important find during the work on the new railway line of a huge LN site.

More details are given by Eleutherotypia 2.2.94 and Thessalonike 13.4.94. Nea Anchialos. ADelt 42 Chr, 358 reports the excavation of a small tumulus some 14km along the road to Edessa from Thessalonike already noted in AR 1988-89, 62. Olympos: Spathes Ag. Demetriou (AR 1992-93, 56). Continu- ation of the excavation in 1987 revealed the N, S and W edges of the Myc cemetery; 16 tombs are now known (six destroyed). The pottery dates them to LH IIIB-C and there are important finds of weapons and ornaments. Cist graves of similar date have been identified at Stou Lakkou t'Ampeli and undated ones at Sto Kelli and Magoula. (ADelt 42 Chr, 363-4) Ossa. ADelt 42 Chr, 360 reports the excavation of a HL settlement not known in the sources already noted in AR 1988- 89, 68. Palaio Gynaikokastro (AR 1992-93, 56). ADelt 42 Chr, 360 reports the continuation of excavation supported by local funding of the EIA cemetery already noted in AR 1988-89, 6-7. More work is reported in 1987 at this historically important site from the 2nd quarter of the 14th Ct AD (AR 1991-92, 45; 1992-93, 56). Work on the tower of the acropolis discovered the existence of a transverse wall dividing both ground and first floor into two compartments, and evidence for the rain water collection and storage system. Wall-painting fragments from the fill outside the S wall included the emblem of the Palaeologan dynasty, and attest a chapel on one of the tower floors, thus identifying this castle with that of the same name mentioned in the sources. (ADelt 42 Chr, 413) Palatiano. A much worn Cor helmet was handed in to the Kilkis Museum in 1987 from this site with its known heroon. (ADelt 42 Chr, 373) Pege. A HL/ER site was discovered some 5km NW of here, with the find of a pair of standing draped statues (male and female). Though the site has not been identified it gives further evidence for the settlement pattern in anc. Paionia. (ADelt 42 Chr, 373) Phoinikas. ADelt 42 Chr, 358 reports the excavation of Toumba Kis already noted in AR 1987-88, 46; 1988-9, 71. Pontoerakleia: Amygdalies. Robbing of tombs in a cemetery dating from the 7th to the 3rd Ct BC is reported by Eleutheros 2.11.93. Rentina. N. Moutsopoulos publishes his work in 1990 in PAE 198-208. Sebaste: Toumba Pappa (AR 1992-93, 57 with refs). The excavation at this site was completed in 1987. No more C tombs were found but pits of LN date as well as EIA and R graves of various types came to light, some with rich finds. Work on T 1, of 380-370 BC, was finally finished. (ADelt 42 Chr, 365-6) Sindos. In AEMTH 5 (1991) 235-46, M. Tiberios publishes the 1991 excavation and survey season on the site. Toumba Ag. Athanasiou. The find of a Macedonian tomb of the 4th Ct BC is reported in Ethnos 20.4.94. Stratoni (anc. Stratonike). An ER relief panel probably depicting Isis-Tyche was handed in from this site in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 373) Therme. Excavation was started in 1987 on the large Toumba (previously known as Sedes) on the outskirts of the village. As this is one of the largest N sites in the area, the aim was to find good settlement levels. Those cleared can be dated to the Predimini and Dimini periods (Classic Dimini III-II); this is probably the earliest material on the site according to the results of surface sherding. In another area of the edge of the Toumba foundation cutting led to rescue excavation which revealed a four-room structure of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 42 Chr, 360) D.B. Grammenos et al. publish an extensive report on their work on Toumba B in Makedonika 28 (1992) 381-501. Thessalonike. Five rescue excavations are reported for 1987. At Plateia Nauarinou and Greg. Palamas 16 the earliest remains were a stoa-like construction of HL date whose use seems to have been confined to that period; it was succeded by another HL structure and a R one. Two handsome walls at one side of the plot must belong to the complex of the Palace of Galerian, though only foundations and two pilasters were found here; the building had been destroyed, probably by earthquake, in ECh times. In this period the area contained only rough structures but in the Ott period a large building occupied the site. At Philikes Etaireias and Tsimiske (AR 1987-88, 48) the Byzantine Ephorate cleared a section of the Byz city wall and its outer wall; then the PR and C Ephorate conducted trials between the two walls but found little except a R pebble pavement. A LR tomb had been incorporated in a tower of the wall and contained three astragaloi and an iron ring as well as a brick by the head of the skeleton. A large Byz cistern lay at the level of the city wall. At Gounare-Bassou (D. Gounare 47) a typical sequence of remains was found: a R wall resting on wash levels or natural, with a scatter of HL and R sherds; further R walls but with no indication of function; a destruction level of LR date with tiles, brick etc and much pottery; over this lay in one section a R wall belonging to a public building or courtyards (with floors of tile, opus sectile and marble slabs) which continued in use until Byz times; also over the R destruction level, a drain (presumably Byz) and other Byz structures; LByz or postByz structures; a postByz pottery workshop for glazed wares with nine pits (five for wasters, one perhaps a kiln) which had caused much damage to the underlying levels. At Karaole-Demetriou 43 (previously Dioiketeriou) later pits (Ott and Byz) had cut into LR levels with interesting material, particularly Aretine and Pseudoaretine wares, lamps, glass and coins. At Ionanninon and Doiranes there was found the tile grave of a girl with two bronze earrings. (ADelt 42 Chr, 349-54) In AEMTH 5 (1991) 247-56, the joint team of the Ephorate and the University publish the first account of their work on the anc. agora. Excavation concentrated on both ends of the E side and on the S side. The following periods of development were identified: ER using HL building techniques; a well organized Antonine programme but not yet including the S section; completion of this programme in the 1st half of the 3rd Ct AD and the addition of a small Odeion; an extension to the Odeion which may not have been completed. The area was allowed to be used for workshops in ECh times. Ampelokepoi. At Demosthenous 8, a group of four tile graves in an enclosure dated to LR imperial times came to</page><page sequence="52">54 E.B. FRENCH light, part of the W cemetery. (AR 1992-93, 57) Three of the graves were parallel to one another with an entrance passage, vaulted ceilings and rich interior decoration. In addition outside the enclosure were six other cists, three tile graves and one funerary amphora. The dead were accompanied by many personal items, as well as glass and pottery vessels; the graves date from the 4th to the 6th Ct AD. At A. Lontou 4, a tile grave and a vaulted LR tomb were found on the edge of the W cemetery; these contained only a few pots. (ADelt 42 Chr, 354-6) In AEMTH 5 (1991) two reports on the W cemetery are published: P. Adam-Belene and K. Konstantoulas report another 95 graves of the 1st Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD (notable were seven altars and the absence of libation pipes and of grave goods) (221-34); and D. Makropoulou describes 134 graves dating from the 3rd to the 6th Ct AD with many portable finds (one can be assigned to a soldier, and important ECh wall-painting is reported) (257-70). Extensive work of conservation and excavation on the Byz monuments of the city continued in 1987, providing new evidence for drainage and water supply systems, cemeteries and the city walls (ADelt 42 Chr, 376-408). Included amongst the many excavations reported was a LByz building (21 x 7 m.) with an earlier phase at the junction of Olympiados and Theotokopoulou, the site of a later Ott cemetery. A well was found on Kassandrou, and others were located elsewhere in the city. Underneath a 19th Ct winery, a mosaic floor (4.50 x 4.10 m) from the peristyle of a R house was discovered 5.65m under street level. It was decorated with three black dolphins rendered in the shape of a trident against a white ground. A Latin inscription was also found, noting the career of a strategos of the 1st Ct AD: C. Vibio (filio) C[vaco]/ Mille Cum/ de Curioni alae/ (s)tratego strategia/ ee coh(orti) Cyrenei- cae/ istae praef(ecturae) aega(ecae)/ class Aug(usta) Alexa- (ndria). Part of the E fortification walls (R and LR) were encountered at Philikis Etairias 15. A well-preserved cistern with brick vaulted roof was found at Akropoleos 116. A long (3.90m) corridor led down into the structure via a series of five steps (still extant). Two holes had been opened into the vaulted roof. A cistern and a well were also uncovered in the grounds of the church of Prophetes Elias. Excavations at the comer of Meleaou-Egnatia-Metropolitou (Stoa Chortiate) uncovered LR wall foundations and traces of mosaic floors on top of an earlier building phase. Above these were remains of a Byz church (?) including a possible double colonette from a window, and a marble colonette base with a relief foliate cross, which may have come from a templon epistyle. A second trench uncovered 13-14th Ct sgraffito ware amongst bones, suggesting a cemetery. A total of 31 tombs was uncovered in the LR cemetery at the Ag. Demetrios hospital. These were built onto or into the natural rock, and included ChTs, cist graves and pit burials. Tomb 18 alone contained cremated remains and pagan offerings, including an impressed gold medallion with a depiction of Herakles or Alexander. The painted decoration of tomb 21, along with the sporadic coin finds, supports an LR date, with tomb 18 being the earliest of the group. Tomb 20 contained an exceptional opus sectile revetment, apparently in secondary use. Another 18 LR and EByz tombs excavated at the junction of Kalou and Koloniare represent part of the city's W cemetery, more of which was uncovered at Manika 14, Koloniare-Galanaki and Papathanas- iou. In AEMTH 5 (1991) 271-88 D. Nalpantes describes new work on the Byz water system of the city. The press continues to give extensive coverage to issues concerning the antiquites of the 'symproteuousa'. The find of the head of a female deity is reported in Thessalonike 7.9.93 et Fig. 41 al.; the interesting find in Bonn of the grave stele of a lady of the 2nd Ct AD from the city catches the imagination of Mesembrine 19.8.93; Ethnos 16.2.94 reports the find of 260 tombs of the E cemetery in the area of the Exhibition Centre. General articles on the state of the antiquities are published in Thessalonike 19 &amp; 22.8.93, Kathemerine 15.9.93, Ethnos 25.8 &amp; 20.10.93, and Ellada Symera 20.11.93; the saving of the sea front is reported in Eleutherotypia 13.7.93 et al.; other articles included danger to the Byz walls (Thessalonike 5.7.93), the continued problems of central parking (Ethnos 17.7.93 et al.), threats to the theatre and recourse to the authorities (Thessalon- ike 25 &amp; 28.8.93), work stopping on the Eptapyrgos as the employment of temporary staff had ended (Thessalonike 23.10.93). In December 1993 the Archaeological Council met in the city to discuss the issue of the parking lot in the central</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 Plateia (Kathemerine 16.12.93 et al.) and the Ephorate press conference on the issue is reported in Kathermerine 6.2.94 et al.. Kathemerine 16.2.94 reports the Minister as saying that the area will become an archaeological park. WESTERN MACEDONIA (17th Ephorate) G. Karamitrou-Mentesidi gives important coverage to the work of the Ephorate in 1987 (ADelt 42 Chr, 418-31) after a gap of two years but, as much has already been noted from its appearance in AEMTH and the press, only a summary is given here. AEMTH 5, which concerns the work of 1991 (with site map) has appeared and is included here. A brief report of new work in the area appeared in Kathemerine 10.8.93. Fig. 42 Aedonochori. A bronze bracelet was handed in in 1987 and the finds of a HL tomb were given to the Florina museum which has also other finds almost certainly from this area. (ADelt 42 Chr, 429) Ag. Christophoros. In 1987 there was handed in the top half of an inscribed stele of HL date and other later architectural remains, all probably originating from nearby cist graves disturbed by work of the Electricity Board; the finds date to the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 42 Chr, 428) Aiane (AR 1992-93, 57). This site is one of the most important in the area, being occupied probably in the N but definitely from the LBA/EIA to the 1st Ct BC. A guide book Aiane of Kozani by G. Karamitrou-Mentessidi which was published in 1989 gives an authorative overview of the work on the site. The report of 1987 (ADelt 42 Chr, 420-5, 429-31) featured the following areas (with illustrations of typical finds, thanks to the kindness of the Ephor and of TAPA): on the summit of Megale Rache are three public buildings, a stoa surrounding a huge cistern into which water pots of the 2nd Ct BC had fallen, another stoa L-shaped and overlying an oval structure of the LBA/EIA with many finds (Fig. 41) and architectural remains including Doric and Ionic capitals, and the 'Excavation of the Ashlar Masonry' with four pillars which produced Attic rf pottery of the 1st half of the 5th Ct BC and Attic bg of the end of the 5th Ct BC (one inscribed 8EMIAOZ). It was reused in later phases; a kiln produced relief wares (Fig. 42) dated by a hoard of coins to the 2nd Ct BC. The 'Houses of the Loom- weights', lower down the slope, are two private houses separated by a passage; the loomweights from which they take their name are of both bun and pyramidal type. The destruction layer is dated to the MHL or LHL period. From the 'Houses of the Moulds' came a range of good small finds. It seems clear that occupation did not extend beyond the bottom of the hill. From the E cemetery at Tskaria some 80 tombs of the 4th to 1st Cts BC (Fig. 43) were dug out of an extensive cemetery (EIA, A, C and HL) arranged in groups of tombs. Metal objects were found at the feet of the skeletons (on a striggil: AAAMAX); pottery was largely local. Other tombs were reported and investigated throughout the area (Figs. 44-8), and thanks to local interest and cooperation much material was collected from the district. Akrine.

Full excavation, assisted by EEC money, began in 1987, also at Megalo Nesi Galane and survey at Toumba Pontokome. (ADelt 42 Chr, 420) The proposed extension of the lignite mines, as well as the dangers of deep ploughing and illicit excavation, instigated a survey of the area which yielded some 13 PR sites with major settlements at Keramidia (M and LN, HL, R and perhaps later) and at Toumba Kremaste (LN and BA).

In AEMTH 5 (1991) 31-8, M. Apostolou reports on her excavation (started in 1988) which has revealed HL houses, workshops and the cemetery; a tile stamped FIYAN shows relations to other sites. Loutron Cave. The important excavation by the University of Thessalonike of this early cave site is reported by Makedonia 30.10.93 et al. Mauropege (AR 1991-92, 48). Further cleaning was carried out in 1987 but in the absence of good floor levels analysis of function proved impossible. A pithos neck provided another inscription: [4I]IAInn[OY]. The area between the wall and the previous excavation produced HL terracing but work was impeded by standing crops. (ADelt 42 Chr, 419) Pella. In AEMTH 5 (1991) 83-96, M Lilimpake-Akamate publishes the results of the excavations of 1988-91 in the area of the Canal. The complex of rooms in Block B appears to be the sanctuary of a healing deity and an inscriptions suggests the name Darron, known from Hesychios. In AE 130 (1991) 15-44, M. Tiberios publishes Panathenaic amphoras from here. Apogeumatine 23.6.93 is the first of many papers to carry the news that an important Macedonian tomb has been found 57</page><page sequence="56">58 E.B. FRENCH Fig. 49 and that its discovery was the result of the application of a new geophysical method, inducing minor 'earthquake' shocks and monitoring them on seismographs. Ethnos 8.7.93 et al. report on the excavation; the tomb is called the largest Macedonian tomb known. Further reports are given by Nea 14 &amp; 27.5.94. Petres (AR 1988-89, 78; 1991-92, 56). Further work was carried out in 1987 on the HL settlement; the S,W and N edges were determined and the cemetery investigated. Two kinds of houses exist: some long and narrow with a gallery to the courtyard and others L-shaped. In addition a fountain house has been identified and several streets cleared. Finds included moulds for relief vessels and figurines indicating the presence of a workshop; the working of metals, probably iron, also seems proven. Coins of several Macedonian mints were identified. (ADelt 42 Chr, 425) In AEMTH 5 (1991) 71-82, P. Adam-Beleni describes three newly-found artifacts which illustrate the archaeological evidence from this site: a metallurgical vessel, a mould from a ceramic workshop of the 2nd Ct BC and evidence for figurine production with Aphrodite on a goat, a unique representation in N. Greece. Prespa: Mikre Limne. In AEMTH 5 (1991) 49-70, N. Moutsopoulos publishes a new account of the Basilica of the Ag. Apostoloi on the island. He assigns the church, built with many spolia from anc. Lyka, to the 10th Ct AD and suggests it may have been built on the site of an anc. temple. Servia and the area of the Aliakmon barrage. Detailed survey of this area proved possible in 1987, partly with local funding, and produced a wealth of evidence including PR settlements (LN and EBA), Myc pottery, IA graves containing both local handmade wares and imported (?) wheelmade vessels with pendant semicircles, HL structures and pit graves with coins, MByz graves again with bronze ornaments. (ADelt 42 Chr, 418-9, 426-7) The finds from the area are discussed by the Ephorate in a press release published by Apogeumatine 8.5.94. Sisani. Work on the Byz cathedral church and its implications is reported in Thessalonike 29.4.94. Spelia Eordaia (AR 1988-89, 78; 1992-93, 58). Amid evidence of HL, R and Byz occupation the first Macedonian tomb to be found in Upper Macedonia was cleared in 1987. Its construc- tion can be dated to the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC and it contained 9-10 burials, continuing in use to the end of the 1st Ct BC. (ADelt 42 Chr, 419-20) Tranobaltos.

The opening to the public of the great tomb under its new cover is reported widely, including Ependitis 10.7.94; Eleuthe- ros Typos 14.10.93 publishes a special feature on it; the Department of Restoration of Ancient Monuments issued a booklet entitled Kelyphe Prostasias en Eidei Tymbou (by I.E. Demakopoulos). Recent work at the site on ordinary houses and popular cult is reported in Nea 3.8.93 and Tachydromos for 8.93 publishes a well-illustrated feature on the Palace. The continuation of work on the site and the finds from it are featured (at the time of the annual conference) by Eleuthero- typia 9.2.94.

Work by the Service in 1987 was confined to the investigation of tombs in three areas. In the E cemetery a cist grave built of reused material was cleared, as well as others of HL, and R date. A marble base</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 inscribed IEPAFQN/ OIAONIKO is published. Nearby was a burnt destruction level of the end of the 4th Ct BC with tiles, animal bones, shell, unpainted and bg pottery and figurines. At Kastri some 11 tombs dating from the 4th to 2nd Cts BC from the NW cemetery were cleared: two Macedonian (AR 1987-88 53; AR 1988-89 82), eight large cists and one pit; all had been robbed though some finds remained. Evidence for wooden couches was noted. A pit with MN pottery was found nearby. Also from this cemetery the base of a stele was found at Kryoneri and there was other evidence of the tombs including bg pottery. (ADelt 42 Chr, 445-8) Ch. Bakirtzes reports on his work in 1993 in Ergon 65-66: excavation concentrated on the area W of Basilica T and along the outside of the inner fortification wall of the Ch town (which reduced the inhabited area by one quarter). This wall rests on two ECh houses of HL/R type with court. House A had mosaic floors in its stoas, around which were other rooms, some of which were cellars. House B had a paved court and one room with mosaic flooring. House A was later altered by the addition of a wall and then again by division into small rooms. Both were out of use by the time the fortification wall was built, but fires from temporary dwellings may date from this period. The archaeologists working on the site used the Interna- tional Conference at Serres to highlight the need for rescue excavation and restoration. (Ethnos 4.10.93) Berge (AR 1992-93, 59). A. Tasia publishes the finds from the tombs in ADelt 41A, 59-84. Chalkero. In 1987 quarrying brought to light traces of anc. quarrying on the site and a rectangular marble base inscribed ['AvfOri]KEv Txapac/ XacKEi£;. Work in the area is also published at the time of the annual conference in Ethnos 17.2.94. Dialekto-Paradeisos. In 1987 surface investigation of this known area was carried out. Sherd cover extended over a wide area in the territory of both villages and some architectural remains were noted. The evidence is mainly of the A-C period but some IA and some R was found. A small R site was identified probably connected with the Via Egnatia. (ADelt 42 Chr, 445) Dikili Tash. Ch. Koukoule-Chrysanthake reports on the 1993 season of the Greek section of the joint project with the French School in Ergon 68-75. The last excavation season had been 1989 (AR 1989-90, 59; 1992-93, 59). Excavation was carried out extending section VI by some 300m2 and produced architectural and stratigraphic evidence of the latest phase of the LN period, including the settlement pattern, some complete house plans and good evidence of construction and contents. The burnt LN structure excavated in 1967 was reached in VIe. Much debris had fallen from the upper storey; burnt grape pips were recovered, possibly the earliest evidence of wine making. This level (Dikili Tash II) equates with Sitagroi IIIb-c. This burnt level was overlaid by another stratum of which the typical features were circles of stones to hold wooden uprights, some pise walling, burnt clay from hearths or ovens and in the centre a construction of two rings of stones, probably a hearth. These levels appear to be developed EBA on the basis of the scarce pottery. The latest LN was also cut by a bothros containing ash and burnt grain, which can be dated definitely to the EBA. One EBA pit also contained burnt figs. The French School (P. Darcque, G. Touchais, R. Treuil) in collaboration with Dr Ch. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki for the Archaeological Society renewed their work in 1993. They report: "Geomorphological study in the form of deep coring was carried out to find the nature and level of the virgin soil. It had been hoped to reach virgin soil quickly in Sector II, as the level had been established by coring just to the W, but levels of clay with sherd and burnt debris continued deep to the water level, presumably indicating a natural ravine of some kind at this point. In Sector V the LN horseshoe oven was cleaned and then taken apart to show its construction of heavy stones with smaller ones on top, covered with a layer of fire-hardened clay and a vault mounted on a system of uprights. Another similar but not identical oven (Fig. 50) was cleared to the E and nearby to the NE was found the part of the clay model of a table or four-legged stool. Various vases of unusual type came from this area. The stratigraphic sequence was confirmed in Sector V E: a thick destruction level of the end of MN which produced important finds including a pommel of antler; above fine occupation layers, also of MN with very considerable evidence of pottery and house furnishing preserved (Figs. 51, 52); on this lay a LN level and above it another also assignable to LN. A system of video planning was utilized which allows speedy and versatile computer manipulation of site plans (Fig. 53)." Drama: Arkadiko. Two articles in AEMTH 5 (1991) concern the work on this important N site: K. Touloumes and K. Peristere discuss the functional analysis of excavation results (359-70) and I. Anagnostou and A. Vargas-Escobar the architectural evidence of the postholes found (371-382). This excavation is reported in Nea 12.1.94. Kale Bryse. In AEMTH 5 (1991) 349-58, K. Peristere reports on the first season of work on Mikre Toumba where a 4th/3rd Ct structure has been found. Nea 12.1.94 reports this as the Temple of Dionysos.

In the summer of 1993 the Norwegian Institute at Athens started an archaeological project under the direction of S. Sande near the village of Petropege, 20km E of Kavala. He reports: "The object was a small Byz fortress situated on the plain between the Rhodope mountains and the sea. The N and S walls of the fortress run parallel to the mod. road behind it, which, as is generally believed, follows the course of the anc. Via Egnatia. The layout of the fortress was evidently deter- mined by the direction of the road, and this correspondence, as well as the strategic position between the main road and the coast, suggest that the fortress was a fortified postal station, a statio, or, more likely, a mansio, where travellers could eat and sleep. The walls of the fortress, the inner measurements of which (29.5 x 29.3m) roughly equal 100 x100 Roman feet, were pierced by one gate in the NW corer, giving access to the Via Egnatia, and one in the SE comer, facing the coast (Fig. 54). Originally the fortress had two diagonally placed towers, one in the NE and one in the SW corer. Later a third tower was added in the SE corer to protect the gate, which was also strengthened by the addition of an outer portcullis. The strengthening of the fortress was probably more or less contemporary with the construction of a building, probably a guesthouse, inside its walls. The technique of this building, which was in later times carefully demolished, points to a date in the 14th Ct, when the area was conquered by the Ottomans. The finds do not indicate the identity of the builders. The technique is Byz and the artisans clearly Greek, but the Ottomans, too, used Greek workmen after the conquest. Whether the Byzantines or the Ottomans gave the orders to strengthen the fortress and build a guesthouse can not be determined, but it is clear that the Ottomans used it after their conquest, as is testified by findings of coins with Arabic script. What destroyed the fortress in the end appears to have been an earthquake, followed by a demolition of the guesthouse. The latter, which was very thorough, was probably carried out by the local population in search of building materials. By the end of the 18th Ct the fortress seems to have been a ruin. As for the first phase of the building, no conclusions, has as yet been reached." 61</page><page sequence="60">62 E.B. FRENCH Phillipoi.

(ADelt 42 Chr, 442) Work by the French School in 1987 has already been noted (AR 1987-88, 55).

Initial work in the 5th insula cleared two shops. Serres. A. Strati and K. Tsouris publish their rescue excavation at I. Dragoumi 21 in Makedonika 28 (1992) 325-54. Though the site produced 3rd/2nd Ct BC remains on the rock which seem to have continued in use until the 2nd/3rd Ct AD, the main feature of the site was a secular building of the 13th Ct AD. There was also evidence of the R period, Byz and postByz burials and later periods. A feature on the decree concerning those trying to get round the law is published in Eleutherotypia 7.7.93. The International Conference on Serres in October 1993 received wide press coverage, e.g. Eleutherotypia 2.10.93, Kathemerine 5.10.93 and Eleutheros 19.10.93. The new archaeological museum opened at the same time. Siderokastron. Continuing excavations in 1987 uncovered the foundations of a tri-apsidal church 19.50m long and 11.86m wide. The E section of the church has been taken up by a later octagonal structure with Byz architectural members included in the masonry. Only fragments of wall-paintings were found. No Byz pottery earlier than LByz ware was found, but SPG to R sherds were uncovered. A brick decoration of a triangular shield was found on a tower on the W side of the Issari rock, and may represent the emblem of the Serbian ruler Stefan Dushan. (ADelt 42 Chr, 464-5) Thasos.

In the Karkametsou plot 80m to the SE, a paved R road running NE-SW had structures on the N of three periods. The earliest were two walls of the 5th Ct BC; there followed a 4th Ct building phase with wide well- built walls; the final stage used the earlier walls as foundations and consisted of three rooms of R/LR date. In the Trikoupe plot, some 50m to the NW near the Arch of Caracalla, a</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 portion of the central R street was cleared. Structures on the W consisted of R houses with good frontage on the E, where doorways faced the street, and less good masonry at the sides; mosaic flooring and marble revetments were found. In a later phase the doorways were blocked off. A 4th Ct BC cist grave with stele was a chance find from the town. Three research programmes were carried out by the French School in 1993. J.-Y. Marc worked on the area of the Arch of Caracalla. After a session of study and organization of the architectural remains that had been found, an excavation was carried out on the small terrace which had already been tested previously. Some 5m of the C wall discovered by R. Ginouves was cleared and can be identified almost certainly with the enclosure wall of the sanctuary of Herakles. At its foot runs a marble water channel identical with the one which runs beside the Herakleion further S. These features could not be dated stratigraphically because the levels behind are covered by the modem street. In front of the gate the main street, paved in Imperial times, was found widening into a elongated square before the arch. In spite of disturbance from the building of the mod. town and earlier excavation, the destruction level for the major monuments was found; it contained many of the architectural elements of the gate, pieces of inscriptions and the lower part of a draped female statue. The reconstruction on paper of the gate has progressed thanks to these architectural fragments and it may perhaps be possible to restore at least a part of the monument. An important part of the season's work in this area comprised the improvement of the area for the visitor. Y. Grandjean and F. Salviat carried out investigations on the acropolis near the grotto of Pan, where the rampart disappears under the olive terrraces. Three tests allowed the circuit of the curtain wall to be traced over 40m. In this area the rampart has suffered heavy damage in the Med period from stone robbing almost to ground level. This allowed, however, the cuttings and foundation layers at the base of the wall to be studied (Fig. 55). In addition cleaning was carried out in the direction of the Parmenon gate; the base of an access stair (Fig. 56) was found to be of the same date as the wall (5th Ct BC). NE of the agora, F. Blonde, A. Muller and D. Mulliez concentrated their work in 1993 near the passage of the Theoroi, in the hope of resolving the outstanding problems from last year. A new test trench was opened on the NE to determine the stratigraphic relationship between the N and S of the area and to investigate the wall discovered last year (AR 1992-93, Fig 39). The sequence as now known can be summar- ized: (i) The lowest levels were tested only at the extreme W, where below a thick layer of stones the return to the NE of the wall was discovered (Fig. 57). Further work is needed to clarify this level. (ii) A series of ground levels sloping slightly from NE to SW can be noted, of which the lowest is a proper pavement and one of the higher ones belongs to the end of the A period (Fig. 58). (iii) In the fill over the latest ground level, the disturbance caused by the laying of the pavement of the R passage was observed. Some later disturbance was also noted, and there were some finds which seem to come from the Artemision. On the SW too, further tests were undertaken to clarify last year's work and in the hope of stratigraphic detail, but unfortu- Fig. 58 nately the sherd evidence was too scanty to allow close dating within the A period. The earliest wall found (Fig. 59) (resemb- ling that from the NE sector), delimits an area with a fine flooring of marble chips; on this lay a fine destruction layer, very black and ashy, also noted beyond the wall but not continuously. In the next phase a wall is built against the earlier one, with irregular but very tidy facing (Fig. 60) to a fill of huge stones behind, giving a total width of some 5m. It may be noted that this aligns with the W end of a similar construction (wall F) on the other side of the passage which, however, continues at a different angle. Against the facing of this wall was erected an earth embankment (Figs. 61, 62) at an angle of 35° with a present height of some 5.5m; this was faced with slabs and seems to have been built immediately subsequent to the wall. Over this lay a succession of fine lines of sand and mud, probably a natural accummulation. Previous excavation has destroyed much stratigraphic information but one may note the levelling of the wall and embankment when the passage was built, the raising of wall M4 with an embank- ment of the SW containing fragments of a 4th Ct amphora, and finally the building of the walls of the NE building (M2 and 5) which is divided lengthwise by wall M4.

E Hill, paved 'Sacred Way': the entire course of the road, some 60m long, which led from the dedication of Philip and Alexander at the entrance of the Sanctuary to its central area between the Rotunda of Arsinoe and the Tememos, was uncovered. Only some 15m of paving is well preserved, but the course of the road, a gentle S-curve, first to the N, then to the S, can be determined from the retaining walls on each side. The remainder of the paving appears to have been removed in Byz times. Where it is missing, only earth, fallen fragments of the retaining walls, and some spoils from HL buildings (brought to feed two lime-kilns) lay above bedrock. The date of the road is still uncertain, but it was probably HL, perhaps contempory with the monument of Philip and Alexander. The retaining walls show that it was repaired at least twice, apparently in early Imperial and in late Imperial times. In each repair a niche was added, a shallow one at the S of the road in the first repair, a deep one at the N of the road in the second. Their functions are uncertain, but they probably served to display statuary or other dedications. Environs of the 'Sacred Way' (upper hillside): on each side of the road, bedrock was covered by only a thin layer of earth, again Byz in date. The only structure was a rough room, built of spoils, mainly of the Rotunda of Arsinoe, which appears to belong to a post-Med occupation of the Sanctuary. Environs of the 'Sacred Way' (lower hillside): the lower hillside to the S of the road was tested only in two places, where a fallen fragment of R concrete retaining wall, and a sandstone block, were visible on the surface. The sandstone block proved to belong to the foundation of a wall parallel to the W foundation of the Temenos and at the same level. Although only 3m of the wall was uncovered, and its function remains uncertain, it seems at present that it belongs to the E wall of the Temenos and that the blocks formerly attributed to that wall belong rather to a central division of the structure. A small trench, intended to uncover the SE corer of the Temen- os, could not be carried to the necessary depth, owing to the presence of fallen marble blocks from that building. Hestiatoria: the S part of the dining area, to the E of the stoa and below it, was further investigated. There are five successive phases: LC, EHL, early Imperial, and two late rebuildings of the 3rd and 4th Cts AD. The latter, once fully recorded, were partly removed in order to expose those more intimately related to the cult and operation of the Sanctuary. These investigations are still in progress, and the area has been covered to protect it pending conservation of the LC to early Imperial structures." Thessalonike 20.9.93 summarizes recent work by the Archaeological Service on the remains on the island: a shrine, perhaps of Artemis, at a water source in the hills, a R (2nd Ct AD) structure and copious finds of the 7th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD. A further press release on these finds is quoted in Eleutherotypia 24.5.94 et al.. NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS (20th Ephorate) Summary accounts of Museum work, site tidying and material handed in to the Museums for 1987 are published in ADelt 42 Chr, 484-7. Chios: town (AR 1992-93, 64). Work on four plots in 1987 is reported, of which one, by the Church of Panagia Letsaina, underwent the completion of work started in the previous year on a pottery workshop of A and EC date, producing almost exclusively Chiote kylikes, bowls and amphoras. By the church of Panagia Tourlote was an oil press and a structure of Ch times which was handed over to the Byzantine Ephorate for investigation. On G. Boria a large wall is probably related to the city wall, and adjacent were two cist graves dated by the finds to the lst/2nd Ct BC. Of similar date were traces of walling on Parodos Engremou.

Work in 1987 in the Recha Nera area continued in two plots and produced further evidence of a PR settlement with three building phases which can be dated by finds to the Poliochni blue and green periods (2800-2400 BC). The investigation is to continue. (ADelt 42 Chr, 476-7) Poliochni (AR 1992-93, 65). In 1993 the Italian School continued their work on the site, completing sections A and M and opening new trials D on the NW and H (divided into E and W) at the N. Section A was made both larger and deeper and has now been completed. The wall which can be definitely dated to the late blue period has three building phases: there was rebuilding on the same line after a first collapse and after a second another rebuild on a line slightly further in. The area outside was clear of structures (as suited a defensive wall) but a clear burnt layer stratified below the first collapse gives evidence of the period of use. Beneath and extending W are earlier structures assignable to early blue, the existence of which was confirmed by the extended trench this year.</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 Overlying the whole are walls of the green period. Section D was opened in an area by the rampart of the red period where restoration in 1987 had revealed traces of earlier houses near the foundations. A few traces of this occupation level were found with, below them for 3.4m, a series of similar layers probably from water deposition, and with some sherd, bone and shell; below this the archaeological material was in better condition and seemed in situ rather than deposited. Section M was extended to the S to trace the wall of exceptional width and careful building which had been noted last year and seems to form the settlement edge. After investigation it would seem that in the first stage (L blue) a small public road with terrace walls on either side ran along the periphery, serving as a edging embankment. Rectangular buttresses supported the E (seaward) side. This was linked by a small E-W road, ending in road 105, to the central plateia. In the green period new terrace walls limited the roadway. It would seem that the city had never extended further to the E and, moreover, that except for a small area at the NE, no damage from the sea was ever sustained. Section H at the N was intended to clarify whether or not a fortification wall existed on this side of the city. In the W part of the trench there appeared in the upper levels many walls of houses dating from blue through to red, but no sign of a fortification. A narrow wall leaning heavily to the W, and a short stretch of another slightly wider, appeared below the houses, but nothing else. In the E the trench at the angle of roads 107/108 was excavated to considerable depth and a wide (115cm) wall was found, with part of another; both had been considered fortifications by Brea but are more likely to be part of the 'palace' of the blue period. Kathemerine 4.12.93 publishes an account of the recent Italian work on the site as presented at the conference in Taranto. Lesbos. The work by the Canadian Institute on the quarries of the island is reported in Eleutherotypia 4.1.94 and their presentation of the burial of a suspected vampire in the same paper on 25.4.94. Makara. The find of Myc tombs at the W end of the entrance to the gulf of Kallone is reported in Eleutherotypia 19.5.94. Methymna. In 1987 work was carried out in three plots. In the Mygia plot opposite the primary school five cists of the HL cemetery were excavated as well as one sarcophagus; all contained double burials of the 3rd Ct BC. In the SW section of the plot were eight cists without offerings overlying earlier clay sarcophagi. Tests reached the PR level and produced grey/black pottery and bone implements. At Ntapia a further section of the A cemetery was cleared with five clay sarcopha- gi of the 2nd half of the 6th Ct BC and another grave with a bronze mirror. In the Mauride Linardatou plot walls and A grey pottery came to light. (ADelt 42 Chr, 481-2) Mytilene (AR 1992-93, 65). Eleven excavations in 1987 are reported (including that in cooperation with the Canadian Institute noted in AR 1987-88, 60-1). Only that at Longou 13 was a direct continuation of the previous season's work. Here it was not possible to do further work on the shrine building but it is reported that the associated deposits date from the 10th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD with a great variety of finds. The plot also produced an apsidal structure (associated with it a PG amphora and three bucchero pots) and a HL well filled with domestic wares. At Lsiou 3, well-built remains were found with a deposit of figurines' heads dating from the 1st Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD. Some rf pottery was found overlying natural and nearby a mosaic pavement. On the site of the new museum at 8th Noembriou and Skra, a sanctuary site with an altar and sacrificial area came to light, but unfortunately had been largely destroyed in earlier work on the site. It can be dated to the 1st Ct BC and the 1st Ct AD with finds including a statue of Aphrodite, figurines of the goddess and typical pottery. The plot also produced other good masonry and drainage systems. On Komarou there was a house with two distinct building phases: a R building with entrance into a court with typical water arrangements, part of which had been re-used as a 7th Ct AD house, notable for the architec- tural members incorporated into the walls. At Kataskoule and Klapadou a public building was found, with a long history of use and good finds; work here is to continue. Also to continue was testing at the expense of the telephone company in a plot adjacent to their headquarters, an area where finds had been known previously. The first tests found a 19th Ct AD house but at a lower level a base built of rectangular blocks. At Eunike and Gorgous tests were made in the court- yard of a traditional house as it lies next to the area where ECh mosaics had come to light; walling, LR/ECh pottery and an inscription: IIOTAMONI /AEXBQNAKTO /XTQEYEPFE /TA KAI QTTH/PI KAI KTISTA /TAX HlOAIO0 were found and the work is to be continued by the Byzantine Ephorate. Of considerable interest was the location on the coast road (Naumachias Elles) of the first course of the A coastal wall running N-S and built of rectangular blocks. Here too investi- gation will continue. At Matiate 11 a cist grave contained a local grey amphora of the 6th Ct BC, while at P. Bostane 14, in part of the S cemetery, four cist graves of the 2nd/lst Cts BC were dug containing tear bottles, a peliskos and an inscribed stele (HPAKQN IIOCCIOC XAIPE)by (ADelt 42 Chr, 477-81) Great disquiet has been caused by the decision of the Central Archaeological Council to allow building near the Sanctuary of Apollo Malloeis (Eleutherotypia 19 &amp; 26.7.93 et al.). The find of PG pottery underwater off this site, marking the earliest habitation of Mytilene itself, is reported in Auge 3.10.93. Skala Eresou. A mosaic in three colours was discovered on the W side of the acropolis coming from an ECh house built on three levels. (ADelt 42 Chr, 481) Skamioud-Kourter. It is noted that the extensive PR site (presumably that noted by Paraskevaides) on the E coast of the gulf of Kallone has suffered badly from damage by the sea but that rescue work by the Ephorate was precluded due to lack of funding.

FRENCH CYCLADES AND SAMOS (21st Ephorate) The reports for 1987 in ADelt 42 Chr, 490-512 are notable for the inclusion of extensive plans, and of three most useful maps to show the position of plots within the main towns.

In the first, just E of the Metropolis, nothing of substance had been found some years ago in excavaton to a depth of 5m. On this occasion, however, below remains of LHL walls and drains there were found G walls, at a depth of 6m, probably from a cemetery area not a settlement. Below these lay good apsidal walls (though the water level had been reached) and material extending back to ECyc I. Also within the confines of the plot were three well-built wells which had been used as rubbish dumps for HL material, notably bg kantharoi, which unfortunately defy restoration. The other three plots lay in the Plithos area, where G tombs were found in 1986 (AR 1992-93, 66). In fact this find was not repeated. In one plot the level was not reached because drains, walls and a good paved floor intervented, as well as unex- plained rectangular slabs at a great depth. In the second plot, R tombs were found, and in the third, 4th-5th Ct AD structures with storage vessels lay over a Myc ChT (marking the N edge of the Aplomata cemetery). (ADelt 42 Chr, 493-4 with map) Aplomata. B. Lambrinoudakis reports on work in 1993 in Ergon 80-3. Additional work was required because a building permit had been sought for a plot adjacent to one where a late antique house with handsome mosaic had been excavated in 1961. It was hoped to find the continuation of the house and the A and G levels which were known to exist below. Indeed five more rooms of the house were cleared on the slope, one of them containing a coin of Constantine VI Kopronymos (8th Ct AD). R and HL sherds were also recoved and it was clear that the structure comprised many building phases. Sherds of A and G give evidence of the earlier usage; one was inscribed. Further work is needed.

No architectural remains have come to light, but there are plentiful typical small finds. Four chronological layers can be clearly distinguished by their colour. The highest contains material of the A and C periods as well as LH IIIC and MC/MH; the next belongs to the EC II/III phase with links to the Kastri and other similar groups; the next (found only in the later season) belongs to the EC Pelos horizon; the lowest level and perhaps most significant is LN with links to the Attica-Kephala group but also with Kumtepe IB rolled-rim bowls.

Work on an additional section of the city wall on the edge of the town and three new excavations in the Phloga area (S of the Katapoliane) brought to light LHL structures and drains, postByz material near the surface, and walls probably intended to support tomb struc- tures, judging from their thickness. Slabs may come from part of the destroyed A city wall. Only cleaning was carried out in the anc. cemetery but this did reveal three R inscribed grave stelai (texts not given). (ADelt 42 Chr, 490-3, with map) The find of the statue of a Gorgon of the 5th Ct BC, probably the akroterion of a temple, is reported in Mesembrine 3.6.94 et al. Pholegandros: Chrysopelia. B. Basilopoulou reports on work by the Ephorate of Speleology on this cave known to early travellers. No tombs or other items mentioned were noted but they may be buried by roof fall; R cisterns were found near the entrance. The major find were hundreds of names written on the walls in a clay wash containing iron oxide, thought to be from the 4th Ct BC. They are mostly male, with some unusual names, but many well-known ones, several with toponymics and occasionally the description 'cKaXo;, Kcaot'. A link with the worship of Artemis and Apollo Prostaterios is suggested, though only further work will explain whether the names have a religious connotation or are merely the grafitti of visitors. (ADelt 42 Chr, 700) Samos: Heraion. Work by the German Institute in 1993, reported by H. Kienast, was confined to study and the arrange- ment of finds, particularly the architectural ones, for more rational access. The threat to this area from ignorance of its important monuments is highlighted by Nea 21.9.93, with subsequent results from the publicity. Nea 29 &amp; 30.9.93. Pythagoreion. Four pieces of work are reported within the anc. town. Cleaning of the mosaics by the gymnasium led to further investigation of the cistern which now proves to be double, and to be associated with a Nymphaeum. The position near the end of Eupalinos' tunnel is significant. The mosaics of a R public building near the agora were also cleaned. One had satyr scenes, and a winged phallus bore the inscription KAI XY. More R mosaics came to light (1986-7) in the Annas Paulou plot (OT 46) and in the Semeles Bairaktare-Amphitr- iona Moschona plot (OT 54) part of an extensive R public building was excavated (1984-7) with one large and four small rooms on the N and W. The walls had well-built faces with</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 central fill and marble orthostats; traces of marble paving on the floors were also found. The S side was overbuilt with an apsidal basilica. The relationship of the mosaics to the pub- lished material from Ephesus is noted. (ADelt 42 Chr, 503-9, with map) Syros: Galissa. It is reported in Eleutherotypia 1.10.93 et al. that a hotel has been built on the PR site. Thera. PR remains from the 'Mauroi' level had been reported from a quarry on the W side of the road to Akroteri by the Perissa junction. Though the quarrying had largely destroyed the level it remained in three places, thanks to the presence of small churches; testing however was possible only in one area. The results indicate a settlement here dating back probably into ECyc but destroyed at the transition of MCyc/LCyc before the great eruption, probably by the earthquake destruction noted at Akroteri. At one point there was a floor with pottery and bronzes (including a Minoan double axe); the pottery was both local and imported. At another point there were circular structures and good MCyc pottery (including one pot with birds and foliage) and lead fishing weights. Elsewhere a large section of organic material appeared to be part of the fallen roof. (ADelt 42 Chr, 509-12) Akroteri (AR 1992-93, 66-7). Ch. Doumas publishes his work in 1990 in PAE 224-35 and reports on his excavations of 1993 in Ergon 83-91. In Xeste 3 work was carried out at the S and W of the building. Although excavation has not yet been completed, room 15, which is beside 11 (E) and 14 (N), proves to be a later addition which was already out of use by the time of the eruption. From room 9 came MCyc and ECyc sherds and part of a rosette fresco. A pile of blocks marks the earlier fall of the S wall. A bench ran along the E wall of building to the SW on either side of a narrow doorway; this is being called the House of the Benches. In the area of Column 17 (where the ECyc figurines had come to light) a terrace wall was removed which proved to be holding up destruction debris, animal bones and material of ECyc II to Early LCyc. A test between the wall and Xeste 5 to the E revealed first, that the wall rested on an earlier one, second, that the corridor had been raised so that the ground floor of Xeste 3 became a semi-basement, third, that the road was raised even higher in the last phase and fourth, that there was a built drain under the latest roadway. Removal of volcanic debris in 1988 in the area W of Delta 15-16 produced the hollows of wooden artifacts. Work on these in 1993 revealed three couches or small beds. As these come from an open area outside a house and other items below them were carefully arranged it is suggested that they had been taken outside in the hope of preserving them from the eruption; this is a further indication of the short period of time that must have elapsed between the first signs of danger and the actual eruption. Work on Xeste 4 was reopened. The area of the great stairway which formed the entry to the complex from the W was much damaged, but fresco fragments fallen on the steps were recovered, showing men climbing stairs. In room 3 the 2nd storey had been completely destroyed; work in 1974 on the 1st floor revealed four doors at either end of the E and W walls; the NW door was later blocked. About im from the W wall of the ground floor was a wall making a corridor or a second stair well. In the fill of the ground floor were found: the imprint of the doorframe of the NE door, the stone bases of a polythyron, remains of the floors of both the 1st and 2nd storeys, imprints of beams from the upper storeys, and monochrome plaster from around the beams. In room Delta 8a the removal of the volcanic 'bomb' revealed three rectangular clay boxes (40 x 70 cm) which seem once to have been sealed. Among important finds in room 18a were two broken tablets with writing from a clay basin in the SW corer, and impressions of two stools or tables (of intriguingly different types). In continuing conservation work, a pithos from the House of the Ladies from 1990 was found to bear four symbols in the Linear A script. Kamari. The find of a huge mosaic pavement is reported in Nike 16.9.93. DODECANESE and AMORGOS (22nd Ephorate) I.

Although this season, as last, was devoted to cleaning and study, important finds continue to come to light. Cleaning on the acropolis brought evidence of Final/LN; in the lower town the removal of stone piles showed that a wall SW of the G enclosure can be dated to LG or EA; it contains some architectural members. Four MG (8th Ct BC) tombs and a small 'shelter' of similar date also came to light. The presence of these tombs within the city and near the sanctuary show the respect with which they were viewed. Astypalaia: Katsalos. The discovery of G tombs in the area where previously only HL were known is reported; this thus seems to be the main cemetery of the anc. city. (ADelt 42 Chr, 653) Leivadia. An early 6th Ct AD three-aisled basilica (25.50 x 17.40 m) is reported. In 1987 SW of the settlement at the Marmaro site near the church of Ag. Basileios, a baptistery was located to the SW. Both basilica and baptistery preserve remnants of mosaic floor. A destruction date of the mid 6th Ct is suggested. (ADelt 42 Chr, 689-691) Karpathos.

Clearing and recording took place both outside and inside the cave, as part of a programme by the Ministry of the Aegean to document the caves of the Aegean area. Outside are a series of terraces, on the second of which are two stairways (one not connected with the entrance to the cave) and pits and benches for offerings of 69</page><page sequence="68">70 E.B. FRENCH pots. A hoard of 24 4th Ct BC Rhodian bronze coins came to light, as well as small unpainted pots of good quality.

Inside, a layer of burning, with coarse pottery and shells, is associated with the destruction of 1824. Kastellorizo. A personal permit from the Greek Ministry of Culture was awarded to Dr N. Ashton in 1993 to conduct an Archaeological Surface Survey of the island. He reports: "The quantity and quality of the extant remains in the mountains far exceeded our original expectations. In short, we have thus far located and identified some twenty fortified sites (all adjacent to erstwhile fertile khorafia); 25 tombs; 43 patiria; olive oil producing artifacts; numerous potsherds, ranging from the 9th Ct BC to the 3rd Ct AD; two almost intact oil lamps; many wall foundations; some submarine foundations in both Mand- raki harbour and the Limani; a number of watchtowers or lookout posts; and traces of an anc. road network. Any artifact finds of clear significance have been lodged with the museum on the island." G. Theofilou and M. Michaelidou publish the Byz plates from the wreck off the island in ADelt 41A, 271-330. Kos. N. Stampolides publishes a detailed assessment of the statue in a thorax found in the Italian excavations, in AE 131 (1992) 129-62. Town: ADelt 42 Chr, 620-51 gives a long and detailed report of rescue work during the years 1985-7, carefully divided by the sections of the town. There is also a list of the considerable number of statues and other sculptural pieces handed in to the Museum, and the important inscribed lead magic tablet from the area of the Sanctuary of Dionysos handed in by a Swedish tourist. Seraglio: Work in seven plots is reported. One on Ephaistou produced remains of four periods: an Ott courtyard probably associated with the adjacent mosque; remains including brick and a partly fluted drum with dowels, apparently from the stylobate of a sanctuary, as well as a floor of clay slabs and a marble tile of Cor type; Myc walls of several phases and the LM I level, with walls of both LM IA and IB. A plot on Apellou, lying within the A city, produced a paving edged by a pseudoisodomic wall and accompanied by pottery and terracotta architectural fragments; the area had been disturbed by later (R and Ott) pits. Earlier remains included a PG pithos burial with four pots and an open contracted burial, Myc and M levels, a slight MB level and a thick EB III stratum with a strong wall, possibly a fortification. A plot on the N side of the hill at P. Tsaldare and 31 Martiou, E of the stadium, had 7m depth of deposit, with remains of R to MM. Of particular importance were two HL roads (in use until LR) not at right angles but on an alignment similar to the mod. roads, thus showing that the older part of the city was not replanned on the Hippodamian system when the new city was laid out. The bed of a heavy wall, the continuation of one already known and thought to be connected with the stadium, proved to be full of a dump of HL sherds, figurines and loomweights, showing that it was already out of use by this period and thus not connected to the stadium but possibly part of the fortification wall built by Alcibiades in 411/10 BC, according to Thucydides. An unusual oval PG cist with the partially contracted remains of a young man, two small pots and an iron ring had been cut into the Myc levels. Four tests into the PR levels (down to EBA) in the middle of the plot revealed an LM IA destruction level from before the eruption, with pots and a skeleton (possibly from earthquake); elsewhere were a thin tephra layer and levels of early and late LM IA. The PR levels were the main interest of a plot on I. Theologou and Ap. Paulou at the NW end of the acropolis: below a G burial pot and the Myc city lay the LM IA city. A road running N-S had been first covered with paving and stones, but later relaid with pebbles and sherds; over it was 'a layer of tephra but it continued in use until cut by an LH IIIC well. A LM IA building had entrances into two separate rooms, and a court at the N with drain running into the road. On Erakleous the interest concentrated on a ECh house of three phases, with mosaics from the latest phase, beside a N-S road (already known from the Italian excavations); A levels with A,G and Myc pottery lay below. Disturbed Myc was found in testing after illegal building on Pasanikolaou as well as the rubbish pits which are a known feature of this area, while at Peisandrou, Ioannidou and Kleopatras (SW of the House of Bronzes) there was no PR material, presumably because it had been cut away by R building (of which only scanty remains were preserved). Centre: fourteen rescue excavations are reported. At Beroiopoulou 1 and in two plots on Kyprou, more evidence of the stylobate of a temple connected with the Sanctuary of Demeter came to light, giving information on the measure- ments and decoration; the external stratigraphy showed that the temple was founded into an A level in EC times; the presence of Myc and M levels below may indicate early cult usage of the area. Other finds include a deposit of broken HL Koan amphoras, thought to be from the cleansing rituals near the spring, and many offerings of A and G date. E of the N baths (on Parodos 25 Martiou) there was found a strong R wall (in structura caementicia), part of a circular structure or tholos, presumably related to the baths. At Ag. Nikolaou 3, some 60m E of the Altar of Dionysos, two plots were investigated and an E-W road with later build- ings on either side was found. That on the N was built in LR with some eight rooms around a central court, and continued in use until ECh (i.e. 4th to 7th Cts AD). The latest phase had mosaics, including one with inscription ((DIAOKAAE). On Gregoriou 5th, E of the C baths, excavation of an Ott cistern and well produced much spolia, including a marble slab from the altar of Dionysos, with a battle scene. Lower levels revealed a HL/R house, with mosaics from its penultimate phase. Excavation of the SE section of the agora is described in some detail: the road at the E and the E outer wall, a monumental E entrance, the E stoa, the inner court and the areas behind the stoa, including the important colours work- shop (AR 1992-93, 67). The stoa appears to be only 6.2m wide here, though the HL construction is known to be 7m wide elsewhere; it lies over C workshops. In the middle of the court is a R tholos with an internal diameter of 12m of which no superstructure survives. On Metropoleos, the road leading from the agora to the harbour was found, while at Kanare 3 a deep sherd deposit (LHL and R) came to light near the junction of the city wall and the W harbour fortifications. Two excavations along Akte Kountouriotou produced interesting evidence of storage facilities near the harbour (7th Ct AD) which made use of blocks from the fortifications and shipsheds, with shops and other establishments again using spolia. The sheds appear to differ from others known or recently excavated and attention is drawn to the two types of ships recorded in 3rd Ct BC inscriptions. East: in this area six rescue excavations were carried out,</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 largely on ECh structures with mosaics and marble decoration and evidence of the HL levels of the 'new' town below. Of particular interest were a storage area with large pithoi intact, including one with an inscribed rim (EIZIQN EFIOEI) and a large underground storage area later used for burials. West: in this sector five excavations took place of which two produced more evidence of the gymnasium stoa while another (on Parodos Gregoriou 5th) revealed a large public building on a different alignment to the gymnasium, of LHL/R date and with small rooms with pilasters opening onto an internal court. Of interest from other sites are a deposit of good iron implements and architectural elements in poros, much used on Rhodes but rare on Kos. Fortifications: at Marmaroto on the W, a strong wall, like the supporting wall of the fortifications, was revealed; it is slightly stepped. The trench is filled with LHL/ER material, including debris from a pottery workshop. Burials lay beneath and later walls at an angle contained spolia from the wall; from their type and from the underlying drains it would seem that these walls are the edging for a roadway leading to the cemetery. The wall trench on the S, in the area of the HL theatre, was found in two places. Cemeteries: in the SW area of the city a rectangular R funerary structure with peribolos contained 11 cist graves and one cremation; three statues were found, and other debris apparently from robbing in antiquity. Outside were another nine unrobbed tombs and one cremation; finds were rich. A child's tomb contained the epigram (TEKNON TO XPYZE/ PQTOE ENOA NHHI/ON OMQNYMON [IA/TPOX ME TYMBOZ/ AMDEXEI). Illegal building in the Marmaroto area cut into the A and C cemetery but in all 90 tombs of various types (38 children and 52 adults; one peribolos) were dis- closed, closely packed and in layers. The earliest were adult cremations of LG and SG, showing that this cemetery started immediately following the end of that on the Seraglio. An Attic kylix bore the signature of the potter Tleson son of Nearchos. Other tombs, mainly cist graves, came to light at Platani, near the Asklepieion, by the Panagia Syntirane, in the area of Bourina and further afield some 4km along the road to Kephalou. A new cemetery came to light at Paradeisi with a group of tombs (sarcophagi and cists) largely destroyed, and some bg pottery. Antimacheia. A new SG and A acropolis site has been identified near the Kastro. (ADelt 42 Chr, 651) Kardamania. The third season of the work by the Univer- sity of Athens on a public building related to the sanctuary of Apollo is mentioned in ADelt 42 Chr, 651. A three-aisled 5th Ct AD basilica (18 x 20m) was excavated in 1987 on the Lambade-Chatzempale site, and is the fourth to have been located in the vicinity. It was destroyed in the great earth- quakes of 553-54 AD. Traces of ancillary buildings were found (ADelt 42 Chr, 687). G. Aleura et al. publish their work in 1990 in PAE 342-67. Mastichari. A coastal LR/EByz settlement appears to have been associated with the basilica in the vicinity. The settle- ment stretches for some 700m. By 1987, excavation had been made of five building complexes separated by roads ranging from 1.20 to 2.60m wide. Glass and incised plain ware were in abundance, along with iron and bronze implements and amulets (crosses). Coins of Phokas (mint of 607-08 AD) and Heraklios (mint of 613-14 AD) suggest an early 7th Ct destruction. Excavations were planned to continue. (ADelt 42 Chr, 687-9) Nisyros: Palous. S of the 19th Ct baths (also the site of R baths) a complex of LR/ECh walls came to light which are probably to be connected with the baths; full excavation was to follow. A vaulted structure is known nearby. (ADelt 42 Chr, 652-3) Rhodes. Material handed in to the Museum in 1987 included several inscriptions, pieces of statuary and amphoras. (ADelt 42 Chr, 619-20) Town:ADelt 42 Chr, 583-613 describes the extensive work carried out by the Archaeological Service in 1987. The report is well organized and detailed but much of it, confirming and expanding previous work, can only be briefly summarized here. In the Medieval town, excavation on Platanos brought to light part of the HL city wall by the harbour, with six courses (five of them foundations) preserved to a height of 3m. Some of this wall was also used in the Byz fortifications. Other parts of the HL wall came to light in the Diakide plot and on Strategou Zese. The former lay between the known line of the wall and the outwork; there was good evidence of the stone-robbing of the main wall, including rough walls constructed by the 'quarriers'. Other blocks may be part of a pier or a pile of 'quarried' stone. Part of the C wall, which runs at an angle to the Hippodamian plan (as Diodorus states), was also found here, with an inner stair and a square tower (6 x 6m). By the fifth gymnasium in the E sector of the city, the HL wall was not found where expected, and is now thought to run under Australias. Sections of many of the streets of the town were traced (summary list on p. 596) including both the wide and narrow types, and a few new ones found (e.g. by the fifth gymnasium). The details of the relayings (up to 16 in one case) dating from the HL foundation on the rock through at least to ER, the boundary walls and the elaborate drainage systems make up a clear picture of the city. In the E sector on Meg. Konstantinou the earliest building level was surprisingly well preserved (walls to 1.5m) and gave rare and important evidence of building techniques; plaster was coloured with black on the lower part of the wall, but decor- ated red above, including incisions and painted Ionic and Aeolic kymatia, quirk and maeander patterns. The upper part of one wall was of plastered baked bricks (9 x 42 cms) on stone socle. An inscribed statue base came from the same plot: OIAOYMENOX XŽ/OEIB EK KIAIKIAI/ EK TAX AIXMA- AQ/ZIAZ OQXZ OPQI/ EYXAN. In the N sector the finds from the debris of a plot on I. Kazoule lead to the suggestion that this formed part of the Shrine of Demeter. Of particular interest was the work area for the manufacture of a large bronze statue on M. Tzedake in the W sector; the details of the three stages of usage in making the statue are clearly preserved. Traces of bronze working were also found in other plots. Cemeteries: twenty-three plots gave evidence of the W cemetery, one of the central and two of the E; the burials are of very varied types, but with typical features dating from EHL to R. From the W many inscriptions are recorded. Extensive work of recording, conserving and excavating Byz, Med and Ott remains in Rhodes town is reported in ADelt 42 Chr, 655-59, 662-80. An official office for the 'Conserva- tion and Restoration of the Medieval City' was established in 1985 and has been dealing with all aspects of the preservation of the Med character of the city. The gate of the wall dividing the city during the period of the Knights Hospitaller into 'Chateau' and 'Ville' was located at the junction of Lachetos and Agesandrou. The gate was 3m wide and the opening preserves the marble slabs into which the gate hinges 71</page><page sequence="70">72 E.B. FRENCH had been drilled. Extensive LR/EByz remains came to light at the church of Ag. Georgios (Chourmali Medrese) from the 1982-83 excavations, including impressive mosaic floors and a large quantity of lamps. The church of the Archangel Michael (Demirli, Athenas square), bombed during World War II, was investigated prior to rebuilding. Originally a 6th Ct basilica, the church was destroyed twice at unknown dates and then in 1304. Rebuilt in the same century, it was used extensively for burials during the period of the Hospitallers, and there were many and varied finds from all periods (per- sonal items, jewellery, pottery, coins from as early as 613 AD, wall-painting fragments etc.) although the bombing has seriously disturbed the stratigraphy. Outer areas: (ADelt 42 Chr, 613-6). Parts of HL country establishments came to light at Kretika, Kremaste and Synoikismos Kastellorizion, but no details are given. A built cist grave with offerings outside (including an Attic kylix) was found at Ixia, while at Perioche Treis the only remains were G and M sherds. PR material of both EBA and MBA came from two sites in the area; the gaps in our knowledge of these periods are now being filled. On the beach by Philermos amphoras of the 1st Ct AD (stamped and not) came to light, as did a HL structure and the floor of a LR cistern. Ialysos-Trianta. Of the seven excavations reported by T. Marketou (and already presented by her both in Copenhagen in 1988 and Thera in 1989) one proved to be outside the M town; the others gave further evidence of the extent of the town and its stratigraphy. The presence of LM IA below a thick layer of tephra was confirmed on all sites; later levels were notable for the quantity of good quality wall-painting. In one area the excavation was combined with magnetic sounding. One site produced good architecture and three bronze figurines. Tephra levels were also noted within the airfield at Paradeisi, at Phileremos and at These Achelantos. Considerably more excavation took place in the cemeteries of the site, both those already known (dating from the early 5th Ct BC to ECh; a 4th Ct BC underground ChT is notable) and in one new one: Paradeisi: Asomato, with 15 cist graves, some unrobbed, of the period after 550 BC, as documented by good Attic bf. Of importance was a HL structure, probably a Heroon, which had been carefully preserved in later periods. At These Komnouki Kremastes a gabled inscribed stele was found, depicting two men, a woman and a dog; the inscription read: IXIQN XPHE- TE EKATEQX/ XAIPE. The stele had been reused as one side of a later cist tomb. Kameiros Skala. In 1987 illicit building work ruined what were the remains of a 5th-6th Ct basilica with mosaic floor and rich marble architectural members (ADelt 42 Chr, 680-82). An anc. building, suggested by a votive inscription and architec- tural members included in the church's fabric, may have existed on the same site. This was replaced in the 6th Ct AD by a three-aisled timber roofed (?) basilica. At a later date, worship was confined to the N aisle after destruction of some sort. Investigation was to continue. Kremaste. An LR and EByz building complex was uncovered in 1987, including a basilica (23 x 15m) with nave and S aisle (N aisle destroyed). Geometric patterns typical of the period were used for the opus sectile floor decoration of the nave. Walls of an undetermined building were found NE of the basilica. Three burials and an ossuary, marble architectural fragments, LR coins, along with an unusual quantity of glass fragments, were discovered. (ADelt 42 Chr, 684-5) Phaleraki. On the Rhodes-Lindos road remains of a R and LR wine or oil processing installation were uncovered in 1987. About 10 rooms were identified, mostly built of unhewn stone. Storage pithoi and possible remains of an oil press were uncovered. An underground monumental stoa was found to the NW leading, via twenty steps, to a square well some 15m deep. (ADelt 42 Chr, 682-4) CENTRAL CRETE (23rd Ephorate) The problems of storage in the Herakleion Museum are the subject of an article in Eleutheros Typos 23.7.93. A general feature on the island was published in Ethnos 22.12.93. A major earthquake hit the island in late May; possible damage to the antiquities was widely covered in the press, as was the visit of the Minister to inspect. Ag. Triada. In 1987, some 300m S of the Church of Ag. Triada three sarcophagi lying N-S in a row came to light; they were both robbed and disturbed. The area produced broken LM III pottery and the tombs doubtless relate to the LM III cemetery noted in 1984. (ADelt 42 Chr, 548) In 1992 V. La Rosa for the Italian School opened a new N- S trench between two Neopalatial buildings, the Tomba degli Ori and the Complesso della Mazza di Breccia. The work centred on the area SE of the latter, already tested in 1991 (AR 1991-92, 59). The series of levels of MM IIB consist of refuse, fill and wash. It is clear that the upper strata indicate a major, Fig. 63</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 careful filling operation, while the lower can be assigned to water action (drainage works were noted) and that the two phases are distinct. A notable find was a Kamares ware pithoid jar with six vertical handles and elaborate decoration, including mould-made flowers (Fig. 63). F. Tomasello also cleaned and studied the kiln excavated by Levi. In 1993 V. La Rosa extended the N-S trench to a width of 6m E-W and a length N- S of 21m, revealing the area E of rooms 1 to m down to the highest floor level; the newly cleared row were lettered n to t (seven new rooms, making 17 in all) and all, in the last stage only, had been parts of the Complesso della Mazza de Breccia (Fig. 64). Its outer limits have been established on the N, E and S; it is particularly large and may have been a public building. The E section seems to have different usage from the W and the dating of the linkage requires further clarification. The Italian School also cooperated with the Ephorate in digging the trenches and water depot needed to place a fire circuit around the site. Archanes. In 1987 M material of MM III-LM I beneath a layer of stones, found in the Troullos area, is thought to come from higher up the slope, where M remains have been noted. At Synoikismos, SW of the settlement, a PG burial pithos with pottery and a bronze brooch came to light. There may also be traces of a pyre. (ADelt 42 Chr, 529-30) E. and I. Sakellarakis publish an account of their excava- tions 1986-88 in AE 130 (1991) 169-218. The new museum, beautifully arranged by E. Sakellaraki, opened in late August and was widely reported in the press (Mesembrine 13.8.93; Nea 18.8.93 et al.; Kathemerine 15.1.94). The important work being done to preserve the architectural heritage of the town is mentioned in Eleutherotypia 11.5.94. Chersonesos. In 1987, tests prior to potential building were carried out in two areas. W of the stage of the theatre the Belli plan indicates an elliptical stoa. Previous work in this area had found little of note, but the new tests revealed both ECh and R walls, and features just below the surface, including an ECh cistern and a 4m circular R structure (?related to the theatre). Further work was to be carried out prior to building being permitted. Near the Hotel Karatze, along the beach to the E, a well built M structure was found (probably a tomb) and two cisterns, of which one has an outflow toward the sea, probably indicating that they were used as catchment for fresh water springs in the rocky area. Work was to continue here also. (ADelt 42 Chr, 532-4) Gortyn. The Italian School continued their work in 1993. In the Praetorium area three investigations were carried out: below the Courts of Justice of the period of Heraclius, in the Basilica, where details were recovered relating to the known inscriptions of the Ecumenios Dositheos; in the Praetorium itself, where the two phases of use in the structure are now much clearer, and in the Temple of the Deified Augusti, which is now shown to be part of the original Praetorium, only taking this form in the 2nd Ct AD. The rectangular structure which formed part of the original Praetorium is wider than had been supposed; half of the S side of the original building was reused later as buildings with a definitive and imposing facade; in the N half more evidence came to light of the later bath complex with the large 2nd Ct AD lavatory and elaborate praefurnia for the calidarium. In the Basilica at Metropolis a third season of work was conducted in the area of the apse. At the N the existence of a surround wall was proved and the presence established of another wall at the base of the slope (on top of which a narrower wall had been constructed). E of the surround wall the excavation of the N extension room 1 was continued. This abutted on the apse and communicated with it through a portal to the ring passage between the throne and the apse itself. A important closed group of liturgical objects was found on the Fig. 64 73</page><page sequence="72">74 E.B. FRENCH marble slab floor, sealed under the collapse of the roof (with traces of fire). Coins of both Constantine II and of the Vene- tian and Paleologian periods were found. Further N, in the N extension room 2, the same destruction level was identified, but its excavation was postponed till the next season. To the W of these rooms are later buildings which incorporate some spolia (4th Ct AD including a spiral column of grey stone like that of the passageway). In the area behind the apse was a cist grave with many burials but no offerings (perhaps due to earlier robbing). A rough cross had been cut on the cover slab. Tests beside this did much to clarify the architectural history of the apse; it seems clear that the extension rooms were already linked to the main building in the first phase. Other tests were made in the area of the passageway and throne; in the first phase the floor rested on a heavy layer of cement and there was no throne, which lay ca. im higher. All the area was covered by the destruction level of the apse; fragments of the upper architectural members included columns, some bearing traces of their decoration in gold leaf. The second architectural phase of the apse had two windows of Constantinopolitan type. A test was made below the Holy Table in search of a possible reliquary; nothing was found (?ancient robbing) but some small marble plaques came to light below the floor. In the S extension the terrace of the apse was cleared and also the end wall (on which later structures rested); a brick marked the S side of the Altar. Flooring was in polychrome opus sectile, like that found on the E and N of the ciborium. Herakleion. In 1987 extremely important work was carried out on the plot at Daidalou 30-2 and this is reported in some detail in ADelt 42 Chr, 521-8. Two major walls were found: one of as yet unidentified date, built of reused anc. masonry (some with building notations) and, on the S side, 10m of the old Venetian wall with arches. Between these were three other walls, all founded on the rock or on a very thin layer of earth and a layer with C and EHL sherds. Here too were four burials dated by coins to the period of Augustus and to the 3rd Ct BC (coin of Rhodes 384-189 BC) and traces of other burials, showing that at this period this area was outside the walls. There is no sign of the building from which the architectural pieces came, but the excavator suggests that it must be near at hand. Four road surfaces from the Med period can be dated by a series of coins. Nautemporike 9.4.94 reports problems between the Archae- ological Service and the local authorities about development in the city. Idean Cave. The difficulties caused by the use of candles by the many visitors are highlighted by Eleutherotypia 2.7.93. Kalamaki: Kato Langos. At the site known as Orthes Petres, where a Church of the Saviour is built on the site of a HL/R temple, deep illicit excavation was followed by rescue work. A large rectangular building (14 x 7/7.6m) founded on the rock was revealed; no W wall was identified so it may have been open on that side (perhaps a stoa). Inside were a bench and 12 monolithic pilasters (which seem to have been low, and not ceiling supports, particularly as no tile was found in the destruction level) with an array of mortars and a possible press. As there were no other portable finds the building must have been deliberately emptied. It would appear to be a workshop of LC date (4th Ct BC, continuing in use until the 3rd Ct BC) which had been cut into MMII-LM I levels. It is hoped that further work will elucidate the function. (ADelt 42 Chr, 542-3) Kamelari. Deep ploughing in 1987 revealed a large HL country house with good pottery, stone tools and other evi- dence of its agricultural and workshop function. (ADelt 42 Chr, 548) Karnari. Deep ploughing here in 1987 on the W slopes of Mt Iuktas brought to light LR cist and tile tombs (3rd-4th Ct AD). Of particular interest is a reused dedication to the Kouretes. (ADelt 42 Chr, 530) Kastelli (Pediados). In 1987 various areas in the town were investigated. Important finds included part of an LM I building of importance, with light well or courtyard and painted plaster, which had been destroyed by burning. It was large, of 'town house' type, and may have covered the top of the hill. One room contained a good deposit of domestic pottery. MM IB- IIA pottery, especially conical and carinated cups, was also found. Elsewhere two Postpalatial buildings were found, one ripe LM IIIB and the other LM IIIC; the latter was apsidal. Later material found in the town included O and A, particularly decorated pithos fragments in a series of pits, LByz houses and a warehouse, and a corer tower to the walls of the Venetian period. On the S the M levels are well preserved but elsewhere later building has almost completely destroyed them. (ADelt 42 Chr, 531-2) Kato Syme Biannou (AR 1992-93, 68). A. Lembesi publishes her work in 1990 in PAE 300-8 and reports on her work in 1993 in Ergon 100-7. In the central section stratigraphic testing in squares I/K 48/49 showed that walls F and G as well as the A hearth belong to the same complex; the latter was founded on the Neopalatial sanctuary wall. Near the Postpala- tial building Q, tests gave considerable further evidence about the history of U and Ub, but further pottery study is still needed to elucidate the exact building history. A further 19 offering tables (four with Linear A signs) came to light. In the W section terraces 1xl-3 link to U. In the SW it would appear that large-scale work had been undertaken to improve the natural incline for outside cult purposes. MM Ib sherds indicate that the foundation can be assigned to the beginning of the Protopalatial period. The stepped way at the NW had been damaged in places by stone falls. Pottery consisted of Neopala- tial domestic wares. It is suggested that the covered sanctuary of this period must lie to the NE of the excavated area. Interesting finds included a handle bearing either a Linear A inscription or a pot mark, a tetrapod inscribed in Linear A and a denarius of Trajan. Knossos. The British School carried out three excavations within the archaeological zone in 1993. S front. D. Wilson and N. Momigliano conducted excava- tions in the area of the E houses and E paving by the S front of the Palace, to explore further the history of Prepalatial settlement in this area, which was first excavated by Evans and Mackenzie in 1908 and by Hood and Cadogan in 1960. They report: "The earliest M occupation levels found belong to EM II and rest directly upon N. These appear to be yard levels adjacent to the 1960 test area. They were cut by a massive pit-only partly excavated-which continues beneath the later S corridor of the Palace. The pit has a homogeneous fill of EM IIB pottery which adds significantly to our understanding of the ceramic character of this period. Of particular interest are the quantity and range of light-on-dark painted wares, and the variety of E Cretan imports. The pit was sealed in part by EM III floor levels to the W. Evidence was found for various</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 occupational and building phases within EM III. The earliest architectural remains are represented by fragments of a house with red painted clay floors, built on EM III fill levels. This house was covered with another EM III fill upon which the walls of a substantial building, also with red painted clay floors, were constructed. The latest extant deposits from this building, for which we suggest the name 'S front house', were excavated by Mackenzie in 1908 and Hood and Cadogan in 1960, and they also date to EM III. Evidence for possible later use of this house (in MM IA and/or MM IB-II) is now lost due to later interference. The S front house adds further support to the view of significant growth at Knossos in EM III. The E paving to the E of the S front house was found to seal a large MM IB fill. Two walls adjacent to the paving may have formed the underpinnings for a paved rampway leading up the S slope toward the early Palace. This paving and possible rampway provide important additions to the still little under- stood settlement plan of Knossos in the Old Palace period. Of possible MM III date is a broad stone construction resembling some kind of paved way or 'kalderim' found abutting against the N edge of the S front house. This construction runs directly in a line with, and immediately beneath, the level of the large plinth blocks of the S facade to the E and must have served as its foundation. The S facade itself probably belongs to the large scale building programme marking the beginning of the New Palace period, although no certain ceramic evi- dence was found during our excavations to support this date." SW houses. The primary aim of the excavation by C.F. Macdonald was to clarify the chronology and architectural history of the group of M Neopalatial houses lying S of the W court of the Palace. Evans and Mackenzie had cleared part of the area but had left an intriguing handsome facade to the W. He reports: "The area already cleared was shown to be a single house distinct from the Palace itself which had been built on terraces cut into the underlying N mound. Though the house with the visible facade proved of interest almost more important were the overlying levels preserved by the slope of the hill which gave a unique occupation history of the area down to the HL period though each successive architectural activity tended to destroy or remove much of what was beneath. The earliest major structure was a house with ashlar facade at least on the E, possibly constructed in MM IIIA and destroyed by fire in LM IA. An Old Palace ivory stamp seal was found in the street accumulation outside. The orientation of this house did not coincide with that of the overlying later houses. Building levels of LM IB did not exist, but the main house with the well-preserved E facade dates from LM II. The N side com- prised a gypsum polythyron with gypsum slabs and two column bases on the N front. The house was built to form an alley with the SW house to the E. No finds remained inside the house although large parts of a Palace Style jar from an SM/EPG pit almost certainly once belonged. It was destroyed by fire in LM II. The polythyron was blocked after the LM II destruction and there are slight traces of another fire destruc- tion, probably dating to LM IIIA2 late. Further reinforcement of the blocked polythyron followed the LM IIIA2 fire, perhaps to support an upper storey. The house was finally abandoned in LM IIIB on the basis of a find of complete champagne cups and kylikes, but no decorated pottery. Evidence for the SM/EPG period includes a wall built on the S side of the blocked polythyron as terrace support for a now lost structure, and a refuse pit. After LM II, the LG/EO period is the main architectural phase on this part of the site. An early 7th Ct road ran N-S flanked by walls including robbed M dressed masonry; other M material, both ashlar and unworked blocks, was used in a substantial E-W wall forming a terrace wall for a building now lost. To the W was a small kiln for relatively fine pottery. A pit, which is dated by fine Attic imports to LA, contained the lower leg of a bronze bull. The pit also provides a terminus post quem for the construction of a kalderim roadway running E-W across the site-the last of this long series of constructions-which had removed all floor levels from the M house, explaining the lack of finds from Evans' excavation." Roman Knossos. In 1993 a good start was made by Dr K.A. and Mrs D. Wardle of the BSA with the exploration of the field to the N of the Villa Ariadne, originally bought by Sir Arthur Evans and now the property of the Greek State. They report: "Seven trial trenches were placed in different parts of the field, which lies close to the heart of the R city, to investigate visible masonry and the features suggested by the geophysical survey carried out in 1991 and 1992 (AR 1991-92, 59-60; 1992-93, 68) by Dr Colin Shell in collaboration with the staff of the Fitch Laboratory and Dr Papamarinopoulos. Substantial remains of concrete masonry buildings, which probably date to the late 2nd or early 3rd Ct AD, were found in three separate areas. The most important of these is a 20m length of wall to the S of the Villa Dionysos. It is still preserved to a height of nearly 6m and faced with large dressed blocks. This is presumably part of a major two-storey public building extend- ing E to the main road, which was surely also the main R road. A fragment of mosaic with a wave crest border was found at the foot of the wall and this presumably relates to the fine mosaic reported to have been covered up by Halbherr. About 150m to the SW, where the floor levels are close to the modem surface, a complex of six rooms was uncovered. The largest, nearly 7m square, had a white mosaic floor with a carpet-like centre of net pattern in blue-black tesserae. To the E of this was a cistern and to the W, a hypocaust room. It is not yet clear whether this is part of a public bath complex or a grand private house with its own bath. After this complex had gone out of use and suffered extensive stone-robbing, new buildings of dry-stone masonry were erected with a similar alignment, perhaps in the late 3rd or early 4th Ct. Remains of the same date were also found in the third area, 100m to the N, in the direction of the Villa Dionysos. Excavation in this area was carried to the kouskouras bedrock which was cut by the foundation trenches for walls dating to the MM period. Immediately above these walls was a complex of rooms, only partly excavated, which seem to be contemporary with the Villa Dionysos, (eg. mid 2nd Ct AD). Although some of these walls were of massive construction and had plaster faces, they had only earth floors on which lay a heavy fall of roof tiles. No traces of any intervening M, C or HL levels were found in this area. Although good deposits of R pottery were rare, sherds of red-slipped wares from Asia Minor, Cyprus and N Africa were sufficiently common to allow Sara Paton to assign provisional dates. M pottery was ubiquitous, and in many places comprised more than 90% of the material from R foundation fills. Sherds of all periods from G to HL were well represented, especially in the wash levels over the buildings. Other finds included pieces of marble sculptures and furniture, as well as limestone architectural fragments. Pieces of marble facings were quite common and include several rare marbles usually only found in Imperial buildings. Small objects such as bone pins and needles were common, while an outstanding small find is a gem-stone carved in intaglio with the head of a young man.

Other work. Dr Macdonald also conducted rescue work in cooperation with the Archaeological Service, and at the request of the Ministry of Culture made tests to investigate the archaeological potential of an area on two terraces near HL kilns which had been excavated in 1937. In one trench HL building had cut into important M material which seems to be a deliberate dump of debris cleared away after a destruction. Around 40 relatively complete late MM III/early LM IA vases were found, amongst them a jug covered with a plain wash and inscribed with four Linear A characters; unusually for the period the jug is handmade. Mature LM IA levels next to this yielded substantial remains of a lily fresco. There were overlying levels of LM II and IIIA, the first time that settle- ment material of these periods has been found so far away from the Palace. The other tests revealed a HL industrial installation of some kind, probably connected with ceramics, and a kiln of the same period, the most completely preserved yet found at Knossos. It is roughly square in plan and had a circular column in the centre of the firing chamber supporting a roof perforated by holes lined with cylindrical clay rings, which allowed the heat to penetrate the upper chamber evenly. The precise use of the kiln must await the study of the material from the chamber but it can be noted that the amount of pottery was slight compared with the quantity of roof-tile fragments. This contrasts with the deposit of lekythoi and olpai found in the earliest of the kilns previously excavated. Nea 16.6.93 summarizes recent rescue work by the Ephorate.

The theft of a pithos from the Magazines of the Palace in May was much reported in the press, as was its subsequent recovery. Kommos. Excavations of the M town and Gr sanctuary continued in 1993 under the direction of J.W. Shaw (ASCS). He reports: "This summer, work concentrated on further clarification of the monumental ashlar buildings in the civic area S of the E-W M road and in house X immediately to the N (Fig. 65). In the latter, which had two storeys, we excavated on the NE, just W of a N-S road, and found a room with two large pillars of squared ashlar blocks, the only pillared room found so far at Kommos, as well as the only use of ashlar outside of the civic area. The room probably reflects, along with other features of the house, the special status of the original inhabitants during LM I. After the room went out of use it was filled in with a deep accumulation of LM II material. Elsewhere in house X, cleaning of Room 1 revealed more stratified pottery; among the finds was an amygdaloid carelian seal depicting two fish. Below the earthen floor of room 4 was an earlier MM room with a fine slab floor and a hearth, all encircled by a plastered bench. There are two civic buildings to the S. The largest is LM I building T, Palatial in style with four wings set around a central court, the original ensemble being some 6000m square, larger than the Palace at Kato Zakros. Upon T's E wing was set, during LM IIIA2, building P, composed of six huge galleries facing the seashore. They have been interpreted as having been used for storage, in particular the storage of ships during the winter, non-sailing months. The gallery interiors are characterized by earth and clay floors, singed in places, as well as by many fragments of short-necked amphoras that probably contained exportable commodities. The E border of building T is well preserved (Fig. 66). A 20m section was cleared to reveal one of the most monumental facades in BA Aegean architecture, with a wall of ashlar blocks preserved 3.6m high set above a projecting socle. The lower part of the wall is executed in orthostate technique; one block is 3.05m long. In some instances a single orthostat takes up the entire height of the course, but some blocks are cut so as to overlap with one another. The original upper part of this wall was probably removed by the builders of building P who added at least four courses of large ashlars which were quarried from building T. Blocks of two of these courses usually remain in situ; others were found tumbled on either side of the wall. Unfortunately, the construction of building P in LM IIIA2 disturbed and/or eradicated many of the walls and/or floors of long, narrow E-W rooms, somewhat similar to but smaller than those of building P, bordering the central court to the W. In order to investigate the LM I levels we removed much of the earthen floor of gallery P3, revealing an often-renewed plaster floor originally of LM I date sloping slightly down W toward the court. After the chief period of use, and probably still during LM I, the floor was subdivided by low, rough rectangu- lar partitions of unknown use, with an E-W partition wall along the length of much of the gallery. then, during or after LM IIIA1, a line of six stones was laid in toward the middle and centre line of what was to be gallery P3, perhaps to serve as bases supporting a temporary shelter or roof structure during P's construction. Two of these bases were stone anchors with three holes, of the composite type (Fig. 67). This is the first time that such anchors have been reported in defined archae- ological contexts in the Aegean, although they are common in Cyprus. Perhaps not by coincidence the two anchors were associated with Canaanite, Cypriot, and Egyptian sherds which have served in the past to indicate international interconnections with Kommos and the W Mesara. The most important additions to T's plan, however, were revealed in the area near the SE comer of the central court, where excavation was concentrated. There, below the floor level of P6, was found the probable base of a staircase, 1.66m wide, entered from the court but also, via a small lobby, from the S entrance into T. W of this room and in the court two fine Fig. 67 77 Fig. 66</page><page sequence="76">78 E.B. FRENCH Fig. 68 stone column bases were found, 0.47m in diameter and 3.33m on centre, representing part of a covered stoa about 5.26m deep. These disc-type bases have the same relative placement as those in the stoa bordering the N side of the central court. If the newly-discovered S stoa has the same plan as the N stoa, future excavation to the SW should reveal three more column bases as well as the SW part of T, if it has not been destroyed by the sea. This arrangement of stoas facing each other across a large court is unusual, as is a stoa (rather than a portico connected with a group of rooms for living) facing N. Because of the discovery of the new stoa, the dimensions of the central court can be revised now to 28.75m E-W by 38.04m N-S. The court itself is composed of a 0.02m thick layer of beach pebbles, no doubt brought from the neighbouring seashore. Of special interest is the discovery of a large, well-pre- served pottery kiln within the S stoa (Fig. 68). The kiln, set E-W of a slope of debris that probably accumulated after the collapse of the stoa, is at least 4.10m wide (N-S) and had four ducts for hot air. Its E-W dimension remains to be established by future excavation. On the slope next to it were found wasters and also masses of decorated and undecorated amphoras, bridge-spouted jars, conical cups and kalathoi, probably discards from the kiln. The kiln dates to late LM IA, suggesting the latest date for the stoa's collapse, probably earlier in the same period, and the subsequent abandonment of the immediate area until in LM IIIA2, the builders of P razed whatever remained of the upper part of the kiln. We also investigated the MM II walls found last year below the E wing of building T. We expected that these might be the side walls of rooms from a building, of which one wall was 2.30m wide and 1.40m high. Sounding next to the walls, however, did not reveal any interior use surfaces. We have concluded, therefore, that these walls were constructed in order to form a number of stable compartments to serve as a massive base for building. If this interpretation is correct, any upper structures were probably removed when building T was constructed. The large MM platform may extend to the E, beyond the property line." Kounaboi (Pediados). In 1987 a PG krater with decoration of incised bands was found containing a cremation and an iron weapon, corroded, broken and folded but probably a sword. Other PG tombs are known from the area. (ADelt 42 Chr, 530) Krousonas (Malebiziou). Trial excavation on local funding took place in two areas in 1987. On the hill Koupos, two well- built houses of the known G to A settlement were cleared. Notable are the bases for wooden ceiling supports, foundation deposits (pottery and traces of burning) and good functional EA pottery in the floor deposits. The excavation has not been completed but earlier levels going back to LM IIIC are noted. In one many roundels of clay and stone and sealings were found, as well as burning with animal bones and a deposit of miniature pots, figurines etc. The building must be an import- ant central structure of the settlement, with probable cultic associations. At Kokkkiniako a Neopalatial M building with interesting pottery was found. (ADelt 42 Chr, 530-1) Among material handed in to the Ephorate are a group of PG/G animal figurines from a shrine in the Bolokas area, and a complete M potter's wheel from Achladia.

In 1987 as well as cleaning of the anc. remains, testing was carried out in three areas of which only that in the middle of the town produced anything of real note. Here (130m S of the Sanctuary of Asklepios) earlier work had been unrewarding, but the new tests revealed a building complex of two long narrow N-S 'rooms' opening onto an E- W corridor or roadway. The presence of Cor roof tiles and nails in the upper debris indicates that they were roofed. The period of use covers the whole of the R period. Finds were copious and of interest; mentioned are: R pottery (with a little HL in the lower levels), coins, bone pins, plates, lamps, a bronze fish hook, loomweights, figurines, glass vessels, and a large basin with impressed inscription (ET')'XwXot Eiprqvtot). This structure is thought not to relate to the R apsidal structure already known nearby. (ADelt 42 Chr, 534-7) Malia. The French School (J. Driessen and A. Famoux) continued their work on Quartier Nu in 1993. The aims were threefold: to discover the extent of the Quartier, to retrieve complete plans (Fig. 69) of the structures by removing the balks, and to enhance our knowledge of occupation in the area before LM IIA2. In fixing the limits, work at the NE angle removed the 1992 stone pile to the base level outside which were found a mainland stirrup jar and a seal with representa- tion of a taurokatapsia. On the E, the removal of the central balk in Room X,22-23 allowed the clearance of the main entrance with threshold and two exterior slabs which were supports for a wooden porch. On the W, the clearing of the outer wall of room I revealed a LM I level with small pieces of fresco. In Room VII, 1, at the SW comer of the structure, several building levels were revealed from LM I on. At the S the disturbance in Byz times makes it difficult to establish the exact limits of the sector. A gravel floor, probably a small interior court, came to light in Room XII,2. Balk removal and other work on the plan revealed the remainder of the floor of X,22-23 of clay and pumice as well as many more pieces of the box-shaped vessel found last year and two stirrup jars. The line of the drain which crosses the building from S to N was traced across the central court; it debouches into the terracotta vessel found in 1989 in Room IX,3 at the S. Examination of the soil in it showed the presence of many fragments of murex, perhaps indicating workshop activity. In IX,7 balk removal revealed a large room with (in the second phase) a column base and a floor passing over the drain. Some dozen test trenches (marked on Fig. 70) confirmed the history of the sector: first occupation in MMII, possibly part of the same complex as that in Quartier Mu, both destroyed by fire at the end of the period; scant usage in MMIII but important con- structions in LM I, one of which was reoccupied in LM II. In places the LM IIIA2 building reused the walls of the Neopala- tial complex. Matala. In 1987 four areas were tested prior to building permission being given. In the centre of the mod. town, Byz and Venetian buildings were found below a thick layer of sand, and below them, a large well-built structure with a destruction level containing tiles and an iron saw and blade. A function related to the adjacent harbour and shipsheds is suggested. Where work on a car park had destroyed a large building complex on the slope to the S of the main road, walls and sherds (including pithoi) were recorded. This area is adjacent to the R aqueduct. A series of six tests was carried out near the important R buildings with frescoes cleared in 1979 (AR 1987- 88, 70). In four of these, good walls, tiles and other finds attest R/ECh building phases. In another, a large broken amphora on an earth floor indicates a storage area. Finds included much pottery of all types, glass and coins. Work on the N side of the Kastro (the anc. acropolis) revealed R buildings but more excavation is needed. (ADelt 42 Chr, 543-6) Nesos promontory. On the W side good evidence of quarrying was noted and on the path above HL and R sherds. There is a small harbour here which would have facilitated the removal of stone. (ADelt 42 Chr, 546) Mesara Plain. A short summary of the survey of the W Mesara Plain carried out in 1986 and 1987 by the ASCS (V.L. Watrous) in cooperation with the Ephorate is given in ADelt 42 Chr, 548. Occupation goes back to N, with a pattern of widespread small settlements which continued until some 40 years ago. The peak periods of occupation are MM IB-II and III and HL; it is uncertain whether this indicates a higher population or changes in the settlement pattern. Moni Odegetria-Agiopharango. A survey of the area was carried out in 1987; three interesting results are summarized: a settlement on the hill NNW of the Moni, probably going with the EM tombs; at Ag. Kyriake, walls found in building a road were accompanied by HL pottery and tiles, some inscribed Zflva; 'AeFXXcoviQ 'A(YKCXantmI; other tiles bore a mono- gram. On the slope S of the road to Kaloi Limenes were a group of rock cut 'tholoi' with benches, entrances to side chambers, well-cut holes in the centre of the roof et al. As they are now used as stables, considerable further investigation will be needed, but it is thought that they must have been tombs (despite some of the features noted). (ADelt 42 Chr, 549) Phaistos: Phalangari. Illicit excavation in this area of rock-cut tombs 800m N of the Palace and lkm NE of the Gr city was followed by rescue work.

FRENCH lartier NU Fig. 70 features may indicate funerary rites outside the tombs. M pottery was noted, but such offerings as were left were HL (figurines and lamps as well as pottery). Beneath a slab floor in T. IV two pots were found, containing in all some 600 silver coins. They have no connection with the burials and seem to be a civic or military hoard rather than a personal one; they are of Ptolemaic date (1st half of the 2nd Ct BC) and of a wide variety of mints, but none Cretan. (ADelt 42 Chr, 538-42) In 1992, V. La Rosa for the Italian School cleaned in the area of the Greek temple. Pottery of the end of the 8th/begin- ning of the 7th Ct BC came to light in pits in the construction level, giving a terminus post quem for the building. In a later (probably HL) phase the prothalamos was rebuilt and the facade embellished with a crepidoma of three steps in good masonry. E Tomasello cleaned and studied the kiln excavated by Levi.

The find in 1987 of a pithos mouth at this site, 100m E of the village cemetery, led to excavation. Two pithoi supported by stones on a floor were found; a clay lamp in one of them and other traces indicate the storeroom of a R country house. (ADelt 42 Chr, 548) Zaros: Lake Botomos. In 1987, following observation of apparent R installations, excavation (as far as could be carried out given the water level) revealed a R building at the N of the Lake and channelling all along the N and NW sides. It is clear that this is part of the elaborate system by which water was supplied to Gortyn, the W Mesara plane and to the newly identified site at Tachere (E of Moiroi).

Two supplementary trenches in area A on the E were intended to clarify both the chronology and the extent of the structure. Two further rooms</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 were uncovered, bringing the total to four. They comprised two architectural phases, LM IIIC and probably PG. In this later phase the floors were raised and the walls, on a slightly different alignment. Similarly four additional trenches were opened in area B. Here the structure was shown to consist of six rooms, with a heavy terrace wall on the S running from the natural height to a low dip, possibly a road; the N boundary of the structure is not yet clear. This building can be dated to the same phases as that in area A. Finds consisted of pottery, stone tools, a bronze knife and fragments of human and zoomorphic figurines. Work was also carried out on the adjacent but inaccessible site of Kataleimata, where part of a house of the same later phase of the M was cleared. As well as pottery and stone tools, a jasper sealstone (LM IIIB) was found, with a representation of a wounded agrimi. Gournia Project. L.V. Watrous (ASCS) reports: "This Greek- American co-operation carried out its second field season in 1993. The archaeological survey completed the requested area (ca 12km) between Pacheia Ammos, Kavousi, Monasteraki and Vasiliki. Our intensive survey discovered 47 new archaeologi- cal sites in this area. The majority of the new sites date to the E, M and LM and R periods. The geologist concentrated on defining the water table, soil profiles and change in sea level; four cores taken for pollen analysis at Almyros were unsuc- cessful due to shallow sedimentation. Villagers were inter- viewed to define traditional land use practices, water usage, kinship groups, cropping and terracing." Ierapetra. The construction of an aerodrome for E Crete has been authorized and survey is being carried out on the ground. The position is immediately S of the site of Basilike. (Kathem- erine 17.2.94) Mochlos. The 1993 season of the joint work by J. Soles (ASCS) and C. Davaras of the Greek Archaeological Service, focused on the island, but also continued its exploration of sites on the adjacent coastal plain at Mochlos, Plakalona and Chalinomouri. They report: "During the season, we uncovered remains of five different periods, including remains of an EByz and R fortification, two LM III cemeteries, an extensive LM IB settlement, and a large EM III/MM IA building. The fortification on the island of Mochlos had been known since the time of Seager's work in 1909. Seager dated it to the Saracen invasion in the 9th Ct AD, and in the survey of the island conducted in 1976 we completed a map of its circuit wall, running along the N and E sides of the island. It was only this year, however, that we discovered the S part of this circuit in a series of rooms, mostly excavated by Seager, which were found to join in a continuous line and form garrisons or living compartments within the fortification. We discovered two building levels in these rooms, and in another room located on top of the island just behind the N part of the circuit. The upper level belongs to the EByz period, as Seager had supposed, but the lower contained E Sigillata A ware of the 1st Cts BC and AD. Found with this earlier pottery in one room was part of a small terracotta head, probably representing Zeus Sarapis. In 1986 a bulldozer accidentally uncovered a series of LM III ChTs on a hill directly behind the mod. village of Mochlos, and at that time N. Papadakis excavated nine of these. It seemed likely that more were located here, and this summer we uncovered seven more, some in the same line as those uncovered in 1986 and others in a line just below. They are all rock-cut ChT's dating from LM IIIA1 to LM IIIB and must belong to the inhabitants of the LM III settlement located on the island a short distance away. The pottery identified so far in that settlement belongs to the LM IIIA2 and IIIB periods, however, and the slightly earlier pottery from the cemetery is somewhat surprising. The tombs contained one or two burials each, and only one of the ten uncovered was still articulated. The skeletal remains were studied by a physical anthropologist who was able to identify age, sex and physical abnormalities, but perhaps her most striking observation is that the tombs were used by male-female couples. In those containing two burials, one of the burials was made later than the other, and the tomb was clearly reopened and the earlier burial relocated. In one tomb the bones of the earlier burial were broken up and relocated in a large cylindrical pyxis, of the kind used for cremations in the LM IIIC period. Elsewhere the couples were buried in adjacent tombs and a small tunnel was cut between the two tomb chambers. One tomb contained no burials and might be identified as a cenotaph, or perhaps the tomb of an infant whose fragile bones left no trace. Most tombs had a dromos, a stomion blocked with a rough stone wall, and a small chamber; one was unusual because it had a rock-cut doorway and a stone threshold. The burials were placed in lamakes or in pithoi; one lamax used for a male burial was decorated with a triglyph-metope frieze which could have come right off a Doric temple. Another was painted on the inside of the rim with two small figures, one wearing an animal mask, who appear to have been performing a funeral dance. In a typical tomb, 20 to 40 pots would be placed around the burial. Large semi-globular cups and stirrup jars were the most popular shapes. A few of the stirrup jars were imported from the mainland and from Chania. Rhyta were also found, and in one tomb a rhyton shaped like a pomegranate and decorated with an octopus was placed with the second burial inside the tomb, and an identical rhyton was smashed outside the blocking wall of the stomion. A bronze bowl, covered with a bronze mirror, was located in another tomb; it held a collection of jewellery, including a necklace of ivy-shaped faience beads, a gold signet ring and a bronze dress pin. Still another tomb contained a collection of small conical cup lamps, one of which still had its wick in place. Two seals were found, one decorated with a sphinx, the other with a lion munching the hindquarters of another animal. The excavation continued to investigate the extensive LM IB settlement remains in three different locations, on the island of Mochlos, at Chalinomouri, and in the field behind the mod. village of Mochlos, which lies alongside the road to Limenaria. The latter work was actually conducted by the Greek Archae- ological Service in collaboration with the excavation; the Service has now decided to request expropriation of this land and hopes to make an archaeological park here. Two industrial buildings of the LM IB settlement are located in this area. In 1990 and 1991 we exposed parts of these lying beneath the road to Limenaria and found evidence for pot-making, bronze- working, and stone-vase production as well as evidence for a small shrine set in the midst of each building. This year we found additional evidence for pot-making in Building B, including two potter's wheels, pieces of red ochre used as pigment, small balls of clay and faience which may be wasters, and a two-channel kiln located at the rear of the building. On the island, we continued excavating two houses in Block C, but concentrated on the monumental ashlar building B. We were able to locate the NE corer of this building so that the whole E block of the building, its ceremonial wing, has now been uncovered. We also uncovered part of its W facade located 81</page><page sequence="80">82 E.B. FRENCH Fig. 71 along the street separating Blocks A and B, and found a small W court here and a second entrance to the building. We did not however succeed in uncovering the NW corer of the building and this will be one of our primary objectives in the 1994 season. In that part of the W wing which we did uncover, we found the building's storerooms, one of which contained six large bronze bowls similar to those found elsewhere in the building in 1909, and a large paved room with a bench which provided access to a stairwell and a basement room where the skull of a young male was located. Remains of earlier occupation were also uncovered beneath the LM I settlement on the island. These included an MM III house located beneath house C7 and partly incorporated into it, a large EM III building located beneath these structures which was used into the MM IA phase, and rooms of an EM II house located directly beneath one part of building B 2's W wing." Myrtos: Pyrgos. P. Rehak and J. Younger report their chance discovery in August 1993 of: "a new Linear A roundel (PYR Wc 4; Ag. Nikolaos Museum 12567; Figs. 71, 72) at the country house excavated in the 1970's (AR 1978-79, 70-77). The pentagonal roundel is inscribed on both faces: one side carries AB 37-[.]-28-41; the other has a previously unattested ideogram, tentatively identified as a doubled Linear A version of AURUM (B *141). Around the sides are five seal impres- sions: two are from a lentoid showing rampant lions attacking a bull; the other three are from a rare metal (?gold) cushion with a cult scene involving at least one woman. Each impres- sion is countermarked with a short slash (for the number 1, totalling 5?). The addition of this document to the small but diverse corpus of hieroglyphic seals, impressed but uninscribed noduli (one perhaps a roundel) and two Linear A tablets increases the possibility that the villa functioned as an adminis- trative unit. A publication is forthcoming in Kadmos." Petra (AR 1992-93, 77). M. Tsipopoulou publishes her work here and around the gulf of Siteia in ADelt 41A, 340-400. Praisos. The 1993 season under the direction of J. Whitley (BSA) of the Praisos survey was devoted to fieldwalking in the environs of the site of Praisos (rather than the site of the city itself), covering a survey area of about 9 sq.kms. He reports: "The aims of the survey were: a) to sample a variety of terrain defined by vegetation and topography; and b) to gain some idea of the sequence of occupation in the region. At least one quarter of the area has been fieldwalked, about twenty-five or more sites have been found, and of these seven have been sampled systematically. It is clear from our survey that many sites had been effectively destroyed, or at least very severely damaged, by bulldozing to create olive terraces. However, the density of finds from various tracts does give us some idea of the scale and date of past human activity in particular areas. Though material from almost all periods was recovered in the tract walking, there appears to be a significant bias towards certain periods. Apart from some scattered obsidian, we have no definite evidence of either N or EM I/II occupation. We have however located at least three so-called M 'guard towers', that is constructions of large, 'megalithic' blocks associated with MM pottery. In at least one case, we can say that the term 'guard tower' is a misnomer, since the structure is a large building with a series of rooms. We may also have located a peak sanctuary associated with a later refuge settlement. Dark Age remains are also plentiful. There appears to be a whole complex of refuge settlements of LM IIIC/PG date in the hills above Kalamafki, with which at least one tholos tomb is probably to be associated. There is PG/G pottery from the sanctuary site of Prophitis Ilias, and there are some indirect indications that other sites may also have been occupied at this time. Apart from some votives, few remains of A date have Fig. 72</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1993-94 been found, and none at all datable to the 6th or 5th Cts BC. We have however encountered a large number of sites of LC or HL date. Sites of this period include rock-cuttings, agricul- tural cisterns, boundary walls, architectural spolia, quarries, tile scatters, sherd concentrations indicating possible farmsteads and an extensive votive deposit from Prophitis Ilias. The most characteristic find from this period is probably the pyramidal loomweight. R sites by contrast have been particularly hard to find. Certainly there have been no large concentrations of imported wares such as terra sigillata, and the local R pottery is not well understood. The same holds true for the LR/EByz period, where our only probable find is some architectural fragments incorporated in the church of Ag. Nikolaos near Kalamafki. Arab and later Byz finds have been even more elusive. Some Venetian period chapels are already known, but we are not sure whether a particular yellow/green glazed fineware which we have found in large quantities and in association with the abandoned village of Kalamafki should be assigned to the Venetian or the early Ott period. 19th and early 20th Ct fabrics are, by contrast, plentiful and easy to identify." Vrokastro. B. Hayden and J. Moody (ASCS) report on the 1993 study season: "The purpose was twofold: to continue pottery analyses and to complete the recording of anc. to Ott sites, in particular the architectural study of a number of E Gr buildings located at sites flanking the Meseleri Valley. Pottery from comparative sites was examined and specialists consulted. A few sherds of Final N date were identified from the sites on the coastal promontory of Ioannimiti and from Kopranes, a range of hills S of the coast. This is the earliest established cultural period within the survey area and the evidence for the period appears to be primarily coastal. The EM period, once thought limited to the coastal zone or low-lying areas, now appears to occur at sites as far inland as the Meseleri area; most of these sites are water sources and produce pottery of many later periods. Pottery of EM date also appears to be located along routes, as in the gorge which links the village of Prina to the Istron river valley to the N. Although many BA settlements within the area produce both Protopalatial and Neopalatial pottery, re-examin- ation of the inland, upland sites in the Prophitis Ilias area indicates that the dominant period at the rural sites is Neopala- tial, with possibly some evidence for continuity into LM III and the EIA. Most Neopalatial activity had previously been associated with the coastal zone, thus the presence of these MM III-LM I inland rural communities adds new data and suggests a different, more balanced interpretation of settlement history during this period." Zakros. N. Platon publishes his work in 1990 in PAE 279-99. Nike tes Kyriakes 6.6.93 &amp; 20.6.93 publishes two long articles on the site in the section entitled Kyriatike Periegese. Karoumes. Excavation continued in 1993 of the watchtower by the sea, under the Minoan Roads Research Programme; the foundation belongs to MM II and the area is divided into two with the tower itself and an auxiliary complex to the W. Surface survey of the programme focussed on the Pano and Kato Zakros regions with a view both to recording this complex system but also to preserving it. WESTERN CRETE (25th Ephorate) ADelt 42 Chr, 556-578 gives a report of work of 1987 in this Ephorate; as no report was printed in the ADelt Chr of work for 1985 or 1986, many of the individual reports cover work of more than one year. In addition much of the work of 1987 had been summarized in Kretike Estia 2, 355-72 and noted in AR 1989-90, 76-82. For the sites of Ag. Galene, Argyroupole, Axos, Bali, Byzari: Ellenika, Chairethiana, Melidone Cave, Panormo, and Zoniana (plan) no important additional informa- tion is given in the ADelt 42 Chr. A major earthquake hit the island in late May; possible damage to the antiquities and the visit of the Minister to inspect was widely covered in the press. Eleutheros 7.5.94 reports the handing in to the authorities of the top half (22 lines) of an inscription bearing a treaty between Polyrrenia and Phalasama at the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC; a much damaged copy was already known from Menies. Ag. Marina. A HL settlement site with traces of a kiln was identified in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 570) Aptera. Work in 1987 formed part of the EEC programme of developing the anc. cities of W Crete. A plan of the site marking the areas of work already noted (AR 1989-90, 77) is given in ADelt 42 Chr, 569-70. Astrika (Kissamou). The discovery of an underground G ChT, which in relation to others known shows the importance of this region in the period, is reported in Kathemerine 16.2.94 and Eleutheros 1.3.94. Atsipadhes Korakias. In 1993 Dr A.A. Peatfield and Dr C.E. Morris (BSA) conducted a further study season on the material from the peak sanctuary excavated in 1989 (AR 1989-90, 77-8). In a longer report they point out: "Joins among the pottery and figurines tend to be frust- ratingly few, especially because in the pottery it is possible to identify a number of fragments of single vessels, but almost all non-joining. Again, however, the joins tend to be between pieces relatively close to one another. This supports our interpretation of extensive periodic cleaning of the site during the sanctuary's lifetime, and yet little disturbance after aban- donment. A hollow pierced animal head, and body of blue- painted bovid have previously been reported as possible animal rhyta. This year we identified several more hollow figures, which may indicate a greater presence of animal rhyta on peak sanctuaries than has been thought. Up to 1992, apart from the phaloi, the only conventional votive limb was a detached leg. This year, however, we have identified several separately- modelled shoulder/torso fragments and one lower torso with spread legs. As such models are well represented on other peak sanctuaries our examples may indeed be votive limbs. A specialised offering area has been identified where there is a much higher proportion of pottery finds to figurines. This cannot be attributed to down-slope erosion; rather the area seems to be a differentiated activity area. The rock formations in this section of area 'B' are different-flat rocks, rather than jagged rock clefts. This suggests that, whereas the sloping rock clefts of B9/B10 were used for figurine offerings, the flat area of B7/B8 was used for vase offerings. Final N/EM I pottery has already been found and reported from all over the Lower Terrace. Relatively large quantities were present in B7 and B8, up to 40% of the pottery. It was found in varying amounts in all levels, indicative of the mixing of deposits on the site; but it is much more common in the lowest levels, 83</page><page sequence="82">84 E.B. FRENCH suggestive of a stratigraphically earlier phase. Moreover, the breakage pattern of the sherds is different from the later material: there are larger sherds, more of each vessel preserved, a greater number of rims and feature sherds. This reinforces our interpretation that this material marks the earliest use of the site, and that it was on a substantial basis. Though we cannot link this use directly to the peak sanctuary, it does not appear to be domestic in character: there were no architectural remains, no artifact remains other than pottery (e.g. no obsidian or chert tools or debitage, no stone equipment such as querns), and no domestic refuse (bones, ash, etc.)" Bathe (anc. Inachorio). At the extreme W end of the island, road widening revealed two simple 4th Ct BC cist tombs, with pottery that included imported Attic. (ADelt 42 Chr, 563-6) Boutas. The chance find of HL tombs already noted (AR 1989- 90, 78) is reported in ADelt 42 Chr, 569; finds included bronze pins, beads, glass and gilt clay vessels. Brosnero: Daphnes. A R settlement was identified here in 1987 and other remains of tombs and sherd scatters in the immediate area noted. (ADelt 42 Chr, 570) Chamaleurio/Stavromeno (?anc. Allaria). An EM site with evidence of a cooperative organization at the beginning of MM (just before the first Palaces) is reported in Kathemerine 28.7.93 et al. A cult area was also exposed; the site was abandoned ca. 1150 BC but became a significant centre in C times. A R bath complex has also been brought to light. Chania. Five rescue excavations are reported in ADelt 42 Chr, 556-8, as well as various finds of HL and R walling throughout the town but notably at Nea Chora (ADelt 42 Chr, 570). Where a public park is being constructed on the site of the former Zompanake barracks an unlooted R tomb indicates the presence of a cemetery. HL tombs (cist and tiled) and G were found in follow-up work, which was to be continued. In the E. Lentare/- Ch. Manolikake plot evidence for the M cemetery was found; six ChTs (and one 'pit-cave') were identified, of which five were excavated (the sixth continues under the adjacent road). Two are large and well-cut; all had been disturbed in antiquity but can be dated to LM IIIB by the pottery. Interesting finds include an agate seal showing a deer between two standing lions and traces of painted wooden sarcophagi. The same plot produced a LR hypocaust. More evidence of the M cemetery came from Palama 4 (near the gymnasium) where there were 17 tombs (ChTs and cist graves of LM IIIA) of which eight were excavated. Copious amounts of pottery, apparently of local manufacture, were found, much of it whole, as well as a range of small finds: beads, a seal, a conulus, a bronze pin and three silver rings (suggested to be possible imports from Syria). Later tombs of the end of the 4th Ct BC and beginning of the 3rd were found in two other plots. Eleutherna. The important finds of recent years (AR 1990-91, 77) were exhibited in a striking display in the Rethymno Museum and then brought to Athens for exhibition at the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art. Kathemerine 7.7.93 &amp; 28.8.93 describe the exhibit. Epanochori: Tsiskiana (AR 1987-88, 76). The third season of work in 1987 at this important EHL to R rural shrine site is reported in ADelt 42 Chr, 567-8 with further details. The deity to whom the 436 bovid figures were offered is still not identified. Other finds included 33 silver and bronze coins of Argos, as well as of Cretan mints. Gaudopoula. Evidence of early occupation of this now uninhabited island was found and given to the Chania Museum in 1987. (ADelt 42 Chr, 572) Kasteli Kisamou. Four excavations (three of significance) were carried out thanks to funding from the EEC for develop- ment within anc. cities in Crete. The A. Loupasake plot near the cathedral was tested, as it is adjacent to known antiquities, including mosaics, but the work found only drains (of two phases) with few finds (R imperial coins, nails and some sherds). To the W in the M. Stratake/M. Skoulake plot, a LR circular structure divided into rooms by thick internal walls was found, containing glass and faience (probably indicating a workshop) as well as lamps and coins. Work on the Health Centre site has been noted already in AR 1989-90, 80 (under Kisamos). Here a section of the HL/R city produced important mosaics some fallen from the upper storey. Notable is the signature on one mosaic (Mep6no7caS /Tr10o0etrla), the complete absence of finds in the rooms with the mosaics, a kitchen with the skeleton of someone caught in the destruction (by earthquake), marble decorated slabs (with thyrsos motive), coins, sculptural and architectural fragments. The kilns lay in the earlier levels. (ADelt 42 Chr, 558-63) Kryoneri (Mylopotamou). A Med complex with storage facilities came to light during road works. (Demokritikos Logos 29.7.93) Omalos. A Museum illustrating this traditional mountain area of Crete, has opened and is reported in Mesembrine 18.8.93. Phalasarna (AR 1989-90, 80-1; 1990-91, 77-8). Work by E. Hatzidaki, which started as part of the EEC programme on Cretan cities and later continued as joint work with the ASCS, has already been noted and is summarized in AJA 92:4 (1988) 463-79. The city is important for its HL harbours, now raised some 6.5m above sea level. In 1987 one tower was excavated, producing typical information of HL fortification of this period; important evidence came from the entrance to the artificial canal which was blocked by fallen walls, a technique used by the Romans. This seems to indicate that the city was attacked in 67BC in the attempt to clear pirates from the E Mediterra- nean. (ADelt 42 Chr, 566-7) Polyrrenia. ADelt 42 Chr, 563 reports the work already noted in AR 1988-89, 108-9; 1989-90, 81. Soure. Deep ploughing in 1987 revealed R walls and cisterns. (ADelt 42 Chr, 572) Sybritos: Kephala (AR 1989-90, 82). Some further details of the work of the Greek-Italian team on this site with its imposing setting dominating the Amari valley are given in ADelt 42 Chr, 573-4. The first season in 1986 had revealed three elliptical pits with early LM IIIC pottery. Five more were cleared in 1987. The contents included animal bones, pottery (domestic and fine) and traces of burning. Further work is needed to elucidate the function of these pits and on the site as a whole. E.B.
