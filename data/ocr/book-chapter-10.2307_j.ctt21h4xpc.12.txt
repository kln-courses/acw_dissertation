<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Prophecy of Moses in Medieval  Jewish Provençal Philosophy: Natural or  Supernatural? Introduction Maimonides opens chapter thirty-nine of the second part of the Guide  of the Perplexed with the following assertion: After we have spoken of the quiddity of prophecy, have made  known its true reality, and have made it clear that the prophecy of  Moses our Master is different from that of the others, we shall say  that the call to the Law followed necessarily from that apprehension  alone. For nothing similar to the call addressed to us by Moses our  Master has been made before him by any one of those we know  who lived in the time between Adam and him; nor was a call similar  to that one made by one of the prophets after him. Correspondingly  it is a fundamental principle of our Law that there will never be  another Law. Hence, according to our opinion, there never has been  a Law and there never will be a Law except the one that is the Law  of Moses our Master.

That is to say, the essence of the prophecy of Moses in Maimonides’  view is different from that of all other prophets and they share only  some secondary characteristics. Maimonides also reminds his readers of  the four fundamental differences between Mosaic prophecy and other  prophecies that he had elaborated upon in his Commentary on the  Mishnah (the seventh article of faith in the introduction to the tenth  chapter of tractate Sanhedrin, Pereq Ḥeleq) and in his Mishneh Torah  (Laws of Principles of the Torah 7.6).2 In addition, in chapter thirty-five  Maimonides points to a connection between the uniqueness of Moses’  prophecy and the uniqueness of the miracles he performed by noting:  “The same applies, in my opinion, to his miracles and to the miracles of  2 According to Maimonides, Moses’ intellect became divorced from its dependence  on his bodily organs (it became a form of Separate Intellect), and he received his  prophecy without the mediation of the angels. The “angels” in this context may  allude to the Active Intellect and/or the imaginative faculty. In Guide 2.45,  Maimonides mentions explicitly that the imagination was not involved in Moses’  prophecy, and most, if not all, of the differences between Moses’ prophecy and all  other prophecies revolve around the activity of the imagination. Yet at least one of  the differences can also be interpreted as indicating that the Active Intellect was  not involved in his prophecy. This interpretation is reinforced by the eighth article of  faith, which states that God communicated the Torah to Moses. There is little  doubt that Maimonides wished to leave the impression upon his readers that  Moses’ prophecy was supernatural, and that he received the Law directly from  God. The question of whether this is Maimonides’ true view is tied to the question  that stands at the heart of this chapter. See also above, chapter two.

The question that arises in light of Maimonides’ statements is:  what is the precise relation between Moses’ prophetic apprehension,  the miracles that he performed, and the Law that he transmitted? Did  Moses’ special prophetic apprehension enable him to perform the mira- cles and to legislate the Law—and if so, these phenomena may be  unique but they still do not deviate from the natural order—or are we  dealing with three different characteristics associated with his prophecy  whose common denominator is that they all are outside the boundaries  of nature? That is to say, Moses perfected himself as far as humanly  possible in accordance with the natural order, but the special apprehen- sion he attained, the miracles he performed, and the Law he transmitted  were all gifts bestowed upon him directly by God. God, and no other,  should be regarded as the immediate cause of these phenomena. If this  is the case, the conclusion to which one is drawn is that despite Maimon- ides’ emphasis on God’s governance of the world by way of the order  of nature,3 in regard to all the phenomena associated with the prophecy  of Moses, God suspends this order and establishes an immediate  connection with an individual human being. The problem of how to interpret Maimonides on the issue of  whether God can exercise acts of volition vis-à-vis historical individuals  arises frequently in the interpretation of the Guide, particularly in the  modern period. It is well known that Maimonides depicts Moses from  the perspective of two different viewpoints that merge from time to  time. On one hand, he sees in Moses the exemplar of human perfec- tion, the model for all who strive for perfection, whether in the area of  intellectual apprehension or in the area of governance. In order to  attain this perfection, Moses had to travel the same path that all others  have to travel. He also represents the outer limits of human perfection,  the point from which no human being by nature is capable of further  advancing. The human dimension of this perfection finds its expression  in the fact that even after having attained perfection, he was not able  3 See Guide 2.4-12. </page> <page sequence="4"> 318 Chapter Nine to overcome entirely the potential to sin. According to Maimonides,  Moses experienced anger at the waters of Meribah, and according to  his position in Guide 1.54, every experience of anger stems from a char- acter defect, whether the anger is justified or not.4 Overall, Moses was  not able to sever completely his intellect from its ties to matter, in  order to become a separate intellect already in his lifetime. In accord  with an image borrowed from Islamic thought that is presented by  Maimonides in Eight Chapters, 7, there remained a single veil (ḥijāb)  shrouding Moses’ apprehension of God—namely, the human intellect  that is not separate from matter.5 On the other hand, Maimonides treats Moses as a completely  supernatural phenomenon. Moses was able to rent every veil during his  lifetime and his intellect was transformed into a Separate Intellect.  Consequent upon attaining this degree he attained a unique prophecy  that was bestowed upon him directly by God without any intermediary,  not even the Active Intellect that serves as an intermediary in all other  instances of prophecy.6 God created the miracles announced by Moses,  the like of which were never seen before or afterwards. God also  communicated His messages to Moses via an audible voice, which at  Sinai was also heard by all of Israel in order to verify his mission. To  Moses, and to him alone, God, and no other, dictated the divine Law  word for word. In short, whenever the divinity of the Law is at the  heart of Maimonides’ discussion, all the phenomena associated with  Mosaic prophecy are treated as supernatural ones that are outside  the boundary of human striving. Whenever the focus turns to human  perfection, Moses is treated as the one who in a natural manner  attained the limits of this perfection and thus serves as its ultimate  representative. 4 In Eight Chapters, 1 Maimonides charges Moses with unjustified anger, which clearly  reflects a character defect. In the Guide, however, he adopts a more extreme posi- tion. Even when anger is justified, the perfect individual must overcome all internal  feelings of anger, while pretending to be angry when the situation calls for it. 5 See Kreisel, Prophecy: The History of an Idea, 181. On the term ḥijāb in Maimon- ides’ thought, see ibid., 173-174. 6 See in particular the seventh and eighth principles of faith at the end of the Intro- duction to Pereq Ḥeleq; cf. Mishneh Torah, Laws of Principles of the Torah 7.6.  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Prophecy of Moses  319 There is no reason to doubt the fact that according to Maimonides,  Moses attained perfection in the area of theoretical knowledge, and  consequently, perfection in the area of governance, in accordance with  the Platonic model. This type of governance is patterned after God’s  governance of the world. On this issue, the controversies among  Maimonides’ interpreters focus on determining the limits he places on  human intellectual apprehension, an issue that has important ramifica- tions for the possibility of human immortality in his thought,7 and the  relation between a life of theoria and a life of praxis. More fundamental  to an understanding of Maimonides’ thought is the problem of how to  interpret the figure of Moses as an individual who merited the occur- rence of supernatural phenomena on his behalf, which appear to  indicate God’s personal involvement in history. Was the Deity in fact  their immediate cause, or did Moses himself work seemingly supernat- ural activities, as well as legislate the Torah, on the basis of the level of  intellectual perfection he attained?8 In this chapter I would like to focus on some of the philosophers  from Southern France who were profoundly influenced by Maimonides  and how they viewed Moses—his perfection and the supernatural  phenomena that Maimonides associates with his prophecy. The philos- ophers are Levi ben Avraham, who lived in the second half of the  thirteenth century and composed the encyclopedia of the sciences and  7 This controversy centered primarily on the interpretation of Shlomo Pines’s inter- pretation of Maimonides’ position in his article, “The Limitations of Human  Knowledge according to Al-Farabi, Ibn Bajja, and Maimonides,” in Studies in Medi- eval Jewish History and Literature, ed. Isadore Twersky (Cambridge, MA: Harvard  University Press, 1979), 82-109. Pines’s interpretation was challenged by Herbert  Davidson, “Maimonides on Metaphysical Knowledge,” Maimonidean Studies 3  (1992-93): 49-103. See also Alexander Altmann, “Maimonides on the Intellect and  the Scope of Metaphysics,” in his Von der mittelalterlichen zur modernen Aufk- laerung (Tübingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1987), 60-129, and Howard Kreisel Maimonides’  Political Thought (Albany: SUNY Press, 1999), 137-147, 311-313. 8 I discussed the central issue of how to interpret the nature of God’s activity in  Maimonides’ thought, as well as the problem whether Moses was secretly regarded  by him as the immediate legislator of the Torah, in a number of previous  studies. See, for example, “Moses Maimonides,” in History of Jewish Philosophy,  ed. Daniel H. Frank and Oliver Leaman (London: Routledge, 1997), 245-280. See  also Maimonides’ Political Thought, 6-16. </page> <page sequence="6"> 320 Chapter Nine Judaism entitled Livyat Ḥen;9 and three philosophers who lived in the  first half of the fourteenth century: Nissim of Marseille, the author of  a philosophic Torah commentary, Ma‘aseh Nissim;10 Joseph Ibn Kaspi,  who in several of his exegetical works deals with different aspects of  the prophecy of Moses, most notably in his Tirat Kesef (Sefer ha-Sod);11  and Gersonides, who deals with this subject in his philosophic treatise  The Wars of the Lord, and more extensively in his subsequent Commen- tary on the Torah. The rejection of the naturalistic approach to Moses’  prophecy can be found not only among the opponents of philosophy in  Provence but also among some of its proponents, as we shall see from  Kalonymos ben Kalonymos’ critique of Ibn Kaspi’s position. Finally, I  will turn to the issue of the voice heard at Sinai as well as the one  heard by Moses in the tabernacle and examine how Maimonides and  his followers in Provence understood these apparently supernatural  phenomena, which do not easily lend themselves to naturalistic expla- nations. In an appendix to the chapter, I will bring some additional  support to the view that Maimonides viewed Moses, and not God, as  the immediate agent of the miracles associated with his prophecy. Levi ben Avraham A Jewish thinker prior to Maimonides hinted to the integral connection  between the prophecy of Moses and the miracles he performed in a  short but highly significant comment. I am referring to the twelfth-  century biblical exegete Abraham Ibn Ezra, who in his commentary on  Numbers 20:8—which speaks of God’s command to Moses to talk to  the rock and bring forth water—writes: “Know that when the part  (ha-ḥeleq) knows the All (or, everything, ha-kol), he conjoins with the  All, and creates in everything signs and miracles.” Ibn Ezra’s comment,  which suggests a naturalistic model for understanding the miracles  9 For a study of this thinker and his encyclopedia, see above, chapter 5. 10 For a study of this thinker and his treatise, see above, chapter 6. 11 Ibn Kaspi deals also with aspects of this topic in Menorat Kesef, Metsaref la-Kesef,  and in his two commentaries on the Guide: ‘Amudei Kesef and Maskiyot Kesef.  For a description of Ibn Kaspi’s treatises, see Hannah Kasher’s introduction to  her edition of Ibn Kaspi’s Shulḥan Kesef ( Jerusalem: Ben-Zevi Institute, 1996),  11-53 (Heb.). </page> <page sequence="7"> The Prophecy of Moses  321 performed by Moses, was well known to the philosophers of Provence.12  According to this view, God is not the immediate cause of these mirac- ulous events; Moses himself performed them by virtue of the special  apprehension he received while in a state of conjunction with God.13  Ibn Ezra goes on to explain that Moses at first did not succeed in  drawing water from the rock at Meribah, since “the part (ha-ḥeleq)  remained a part”—that is to say, because of his quarrel with the Israel- ites he did not succeed in immediately attaining the state of conjunction  and “becoming universal (kelali),” which would have enabled him to  perform the miracle without a flaw. In his initial attempt to bring forth  water, Moses’ intellect remained incapable of affecting that which is  outside the body to which it is attached, and did not become a universal  intellect capable of influencing all entities on earth. Levi, who was well aware of Ibn Ezra’s approach, deals with Moses  in a number of chapters belonging to the first treatise (“The Quality of  Prophecy and the Secrets of the Torah”) in the second part of Livyat  Ḥen.14 In his discussion of miracles in the second treatise, “The Secrets  of the Faith,” he presents a number of interpretations that shed further  light on this topic.15 Seldom does Levi content himself with a single  12 For a study of Ibn Ezra’s approach to miracles and its influence on subsequent  Jewish thinkers, see Aviezer Ravitzky, “The Anthropological Theory of Miracles in  Medieval Jewish Philosophy,” in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature,  ed. Isadore Twersky (Cambridge MA: Harvard University, 1984), 231-272. See also  Howard Kreisel, “Miracles in Medieval Jewish Philosophy,” Jewish Quarterly  Review 75 (1984): 106-114. Ibn Ezra was not the only Jewish thinker prior to  Maimonides to view the prophet himself as the agent of miracles. Abraham Ibn  Daud too presents this view based on Avicenna’s approach; See Emunah Ramah,  ed. Samuel Weil (Frankfurt, 1852), 2.5.1, 73. In his treatise, Ibn Daud deals exten- sively with the subject of prophecy in general and that of Moses in particular. For  a study of this topic in his thought, see T. A. M. Fontaine, In Defence of Judaism:  Abraham Ibn Daud (Assen, Netherlands: Van Gorcum, 1990), 137-166.  13 I do not think that Ibn Ezra is referring to a state of unification with God, but  rather a state in which he joins the world of the angels that stands immediately  below the level of God in the hierarchy of existence. For Ibn Ezra’s description of  the world of the angels, see in particular his commentary on Exodus 3:15. 14 See Levi ben Avraham, Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy and the Secrets of the  Torah, ed.

At times he  determines which interpretation is the correct one and at times he  leaves the choice to the reader. Thus one should not expect a consistent  approach to our subject, but to a variety of possible interpretations.  What is noteworthy are some of the possibilities that this thir- teenth-century thinker permits himself to present explicitly to his  Jewish audience. Levi deals at length with a good number of issues  related to Moses and his prophecy—e.g., the private revelation to  Moses at Sinai in the cleft of the rock, the sin of Moses, and Moses’  speech impediment. In this chapter, I will focus only upon the question  of the relation between Moses’ perfection, his prophecy, and the mira- cles he performed. Levi agrees with the view that Moses achieved human perfection  in a naturalistic manner. He was born with a perfect temperament and  completed his studies of all of the sciences.16 In his interpretation of the  import of the verse: Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three  when they made their demand on Pharaoh (Exodus 7:7), Levi writes:  “That is to say, they had much time and many years to learn and perfect  their souls by knowledge of all the sciences. In addition, at this age the  imaginative faculty is weak in consequence of the weakening of one’s  physical faculties. This enabled him [Moses] to prophesy without the  use of the imaginative faculty, between the two cherubs [Exodus 25:22].”17  Levi interprets between the two cherubs as a metaphor signifying the  emanation of the Active Intellect directly upon the intellect of Moses  without the mediation of the imaginative faculty.18 This attainment is  Press, 2014), especially chaps. 12-13 (Heb.). 16 On the relation of one’s natural temperament and the learning of the sciences, see  Guide 1.34 (the fourth cause that prevents instruction in the divine science).  17 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 123, 733. 18 This interpretation is based upon Maimonides’ remarks toward the end of Guide  2.45. According to Levi, the cherub is a metaphor for the intellect—whether the  Active Intellect or the human intellect; see Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy,  224. He also brings an additional interpretation of this verse: “In order that one  should not err in thinking that the speech went out from the figure of the cherub,  and that one should not treat it as a divinity, the story comes to tell us that Moses  heard the voice between the two cherubs, not from the cherubs themselves” (589);  </page> <page sequence="9"> The Prophecy of Moses  323 definitely unique in Levi’s view, but not one that breaches the boundary  of nature, as he writes: “I have already explained that Moses was the  most exceptional member of the human species and his intellectual  apprehension was of the utmost level of human apprehension.”19 In  other words: “Moses apprehended all that is possible for a human being  to apprehend, and he conjoined with the angels [Active Intellect].  Consequently it is said: Moses approached the thick cloud where God  [Elohim] was [Exodus 20:18], the name Elohim alluding to the angels.”20 According to Levi’s descriptions of the prophecy of Moses, one can  detect a progression in Moses’ prophetic attainment, insofar as the first  prophetic experience of his, the vision of the burning bush, was more  “corporeal” than his prophetic experience at Sinai. Levi writes: For sixty years, Moses was a corporeal being, as we already saw, for  it is said: she hid him for three months [Exodus 2:2]. This alludes to  the three previous periods in a person’s life, for it is said: also from  yesterday, also from the day before [Exodus 4:10]. In the seventh  decade [of a person’s life] the darkness of matter departs, as it is  said: the cloud hid it [the glory of God] for six days and on the seventh  day it called to Moses from the midst of the cloud [Exodus 24:16]. This  has the same meaning as: God called to him from the midst of the bush  [Exodus 3:8], as we shall explain. However, from the midst of the  bush indicates a more corporeal, unrefined vision than the one indi- cated by the words from the midst of the cloud, since the vision of the  bush was the first one that he beheld.21 Levi echoes the view to which Maimonides alludes in Guide 3.45, where  the latter writes: “Even in the case of Moses our Master, his prophetic  cf. Guide 3.45. For a study of different interpretations of this verse among Maimon- ides’ followers, see Esti Eisenmann, “‘From Above the Covering of the Ark, from  Between the Two Cherubim’: A Study of Jewish Philosophical Interpretation,” in  Moses the Man: Master of the Prophets, ed.

For a discussion of the problem of conjunction of the human intellect  with the Active Intellect in Maimonides’ thought, see the studies mentioned above  in note 7. For the Arabic philosophical background of this problem, see Herbert  Davidson, Alfarabi, Avicenna and Averroes on the Intellect (Oxford: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1992).  21 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 733. </page> <page sequence="10"> 324 Chapter Nine mission is inaugurated through an angel: And there appeared unto him an  angel of the Lord in the heart of fire [Exodus 3:2]” (576). The “angel” in  this context appears to represent the imaginative faculty. Only after- ward did Moses reach the level that he was able to dispense with this  faculty in the attainment of prophecy.22 Levi, again following Maimon- ides’ lead, sees in the vexation experienced by Moses as a result of the  complaints of the Israelites an impairment to the acquisition of prophecy,  as can be seen from his sin at the waters of Meribah, where he has to  hit the rock twice in order to bring forth water.23 The depiction of Moses’ prophecy till this point is a unique one  that nevertheless does not breach the boundaries of the impersonal  natural order. Moreover, Levi is clear on the point that Moses’ prophecy  was a result of conjunction with the Active Intellect, as is the case with  the other prophets. While Maimonides frames his comments in a way  that can be interpreted that Moses received his prophecy directly from  God, Levi appears to reject this possibility. The characteristic distin- guishing Moses’ prophecy from all others is the purely intellectual  nature of his prophecy, without the involvement of the imagination.  22 I will return to this passage in the appendix to the chapter. Jacob Levinger was of  the opinion that Maimonides’ esoteric teaching on this issue is that even at Mount  Sinai Moses’ prophecy was by way of the imaginative faculty, and hence there was  no categorical difference between the nature of his prophecy and that of the other  prophets; see Jacob Levinger, Maimonides as Philosopher and Codifier (Jerusalem:  Bialik Institute, 1989), 29-38 (Heb.). For a study of fourteenth-century Jewish  philosophers who also ascribed an imaginative element to Moses’ prophecy, see  Dov Schwartz, “Mosaic Prophecy in the Writings of a Fourteenth Century Jewish  Neoplatonist Circle,” Jewish Thought and Philosophy 2 (1992): 97-110. My own view  is that Maimonides held that Moses’ prophetic experience at Sinai was a purely  intellectual one focusing on the order of existence, but that his imagination came  into play in “translating” this knowledge into a perfect legislation; see Prophecy:  The History of an Idea in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 283-284.  23 See Levi’s extensive discussion of this story in Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy,  744-753. Levi insists that Moses was supposed to hit the rock, and for this reason  was commanded to take his staff with him, but due to his vexation with the nation  he was not able to bring forth water immediately by a single stroke. Compare to  Maimonides’ comment in Guide 2.36, where he maintains that the vexation expe- rienced by Moses due to the episode of the spies resulted in prophetic revelation  not coming to him “in the way that revelation used to come before, because— seeing the enormity of their crime—he suffered greatly because of this matter”  (372-373). </page> <page sequence="11"> The Prophecy of Moses  325 Yet Levi also brings a number of interpretations that suggest the  opposite conclusion, and that he in fact sees God as the immediate  cause of Moses’ unique prophecy. Moreover, Levi’s interpretations of  phenomena mentioned in the Torah that appear to be outside the  boundaries of nature do not always reflect a naturalistic approach. It is  possible that we are dealing in these cases with an esoteric level to his  writing, given the religious sensitivity of the issues involved. Levi pres- ents interpretations that ascribe to God the ability to act directly and  miraculously in history in order to hide his view that all events should  be understood in a manner that is in harmony with the workings of the  natural order. One, however, should not reject the possibility that Levi  in fact did not reach a definitive conclusion on this issue and leaves the  matter open. In any case, the fact that he introduced naturalistic expla- nations in interpreting these events in a treatise intended for a general  Jewish audience, and it appears that his tendency is to favor these inter- pretations, is highly significant. The tendency to understand Moses’ prophecy in accordance with a  naturalistic model, while not ruling out the alternate possibility, finds  its expression in other issues associated with this prophecy. In regard to  the Torah’s statement that Moses neither ate bread nor drank water  during the forty days he was on Mount Sinai,24 Levi offers two explana- tions: “Due to the strength of his conjunction with God and his soul’s  passion for knowledge, a supernal power emanated upon him which  strengthened his body, fortified his disposition, and preserved him  without food or drink during this period. An alternate explanation [is  that] this was by way of a miracle.”25 According to the first explanation,  the attainment of conjunction naturally resulted in the body being  preserved without the necessity for the intake of nourishment in order  to maintain it, and one need not ascribe this phenomenon to the miracle  working ability of God. Levi’s interpretation suggests that the intellect  in this state achieves independence from the body and can function  24 See Exodus 34:28; Deuteronomy 9:9. 25 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 743. </page> <page sequence="12"> 326 Chapter Nine without being sustained by it,26 while at the same time the body attains  a static state in which it does not deteriorate. Alternately, the notion  that this was a miraculous occurrence due to God’s direct involvement  is also a possible explanation in his view. As for Moses’ miracles, Levi writes: “God taught the prophet in a  general way how to change nature and create miracles that He decreed  should be performed by him [the prophet], as Ibn Ezra maintained:  ‘When the part knows the All, he conjoins with the All, and creates  signs and miracles’ [Commentary on Numbers 20:8].”27 Levi points to  the connection between the miracles performed by Moses and his  knowledge of the Tetragrammaton: We already explained that the Tetragrammaton refers only to the  One who is the origin of all existents. . . . Only the Necessary Exis- tent is capable of changing nature, insofar as it is the first cause of  nature, as it is said [of Him]: who alone makes miracles [Psalms  72:18]. Consequently it is said that [this name] refers to His quality  of mercy, for it is fitting that the shepherd governs, watches over,  and is compassionate. But Elohim refers to the quality of judgment,  for the judge must engage in judgment. Consequently it is said: And  my name the Tetragrammaton I did not inform them [Exodus 6:3], for  only by this name can one create miracles. . . . Through Moses God  began to perform miracles in the world, and he was the first of the  prophets who was sent to the nation with a mission.28 Levi in this passage does not claim that Moses worked the miracles,  rather God did. Yet one can find an allusion to the idea that Moses was  their immediate agent in Levi’s subsequent comments: Some of the signs were performed by Aaron, because he was subtler  in bringing them about and he understood their natural component.  In addition, in the change of agents the effects change. Aaron also  knew how to determine the moment that the plagues will come.  26 Compare the explanation offered by Moses Ibn Tibbon in his Sefer Pe’ah, 3 (The  Writings of R. Moshe Ibn Tibbon, ed. Howard Kreisel, Colette Sirat, and  Avraham Israel [Beer-Sheva: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press, 2010],  105-6 [Heb.]). 27 Livyat Ḥen: The Secrets of the Faith, 94. 28 Ibid., 95. As for the notion that Moses was the first to issue a call to others in the  name of God by virtue of his prophecy, see Guide 2.39. </page> <page sequence="13"> The Prophecy of Moses  327 Perhaps these things were accomplished with the help of astral  forces, and Aaron knew how to determine the appropriate times,  and he would choose them in accordance with the word of God.29 Aaron, in other words, was an adept in astrology and it is precisely the  knowledge of the effects of the astral forces and how to manipulate  them that enabled him to bring about some of the plagues at the  times that he did.30 Similarly, Moses was able to perform miracles as a  result of his unique knowledge of the order of existence that he attained  by way of prophecy. This can be inferred from Levi’s treatment of the  miracle of the “opening up of the mouth of the earth” that swallowed  up the followers of Koraḥ—one of the miracles God created at the end  of the sixth day, according to Mishnah Avot 5.6: “The opening up of the mouth of the earth”—this designates an  earthquake. The sign lies in God informing Moses the time that it  was to take place. Each instance of this phenomenon occurred when  needed. Also belonging to this category is what they [the Sages] said:  “The wall of Jericho that was swallowed up where it stood” [BT  Berakhot 54a], similar to what happens in the collapsing of towns  and the sinking of city-states.31 One may interpret Levi as maintaining that God purposefully implanted  in the order earthquakes at specific times and places in order to aid  Israel when the proper time came. Yet he appears to be hinting to the  fact that earthquakes are natural occurrences. By knowing when and  where they occur based on a complete knowledge of the natural order,  the prophet can utilize them for his purposes, as in the case of the  ground swallowing up Koraḥ or the earthquake that brought down the  walls of Jericho.32 29 Livyat Ḥen: The Secrets of the Faith, 95. 30 For a study of approaches to astrology among medieval Jewish thinkers, see Dov  Schwartz, Astral Magic in Medieval Jewish Thought (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan Univer- sity Press, 1999) (Heb.); see especially his treatment of Levi on pages 245-254. 31 Livyat Ḥen: The Secrets of the Faith, 95. 32 One may further argue that the latter earthquake was hastened by the command to  march around the city seven times and then sound the trumpets. Levi, however,  prefers a symbolic reason for this action—namely, to show that Israel is not ruled  by the seven planets. See ibid., 107. </page> <page sequence="14"> 328 Chapter Nine As in the case of Aaron, Moses too was an expert in astrology, a  view that Levi tries to show is attested to also in rabbinic midrash: Since He saw that the nativity of Moses was weaker than the constel- lation of Amaleq, and if Moses fought against them he would  lose—and perhaps this is what is alluded to in saying: the hands of  Moses were heavy [Exodus 17.12]—and Joshua’s constellation was  stronger than his, therefore He commanded Joshua to fight Amaleq.  Moses chose special hours by way of prophecy, and he would raise  then up his hands by the word of God, as it is indicated in the Chap- ters of Rabbi Eliezer: “And his hands were steady [ibid.]—Amaleq  came upon them in accordance with their astrological decree. Moses  came, halted the sun and the moon and mixed up their hours, as it is  said: The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation [Habakkuk  3:11], and it is written: and lifted up his hands on high” [ibid., 10].33  “Came upon them in accordance with their astrological decree”— that is to say, they saw that Israel departed [Egypt] under the  influence of an evil star, thus they came upon them. For if this is not  the case, what need was there to “mix up the hours”? After all,  “Israel is not under the influence of the constellations” (BT Shabbat  156a). Furthermore, what was the purpose of halting the moon?34  The meaning of: and Aaron and Ḥur supported his hands [Exodus  17:12], is that they aided him by what they knew of this subject. . . .35  In the Midrash of Psalms: “Pick some men for us [ibid., 9]—from  those born on the first [of] Adar.” The reason for this is that the  moon then enters into the constellation of Aquarius, which is the  constellation of Israel. It appears that he also desired that the  ascending constellation be Aquarius at the time of the new moon in  order that the particular should agree with the generality.36 Even  though Moses at first experienced difficulties in his study of the  mathematical sciences due to his natural temperament, God at the  end enabled him to comprehend them. Or perhaps he was an expert  only in the area of astrology.37 33 This quotation does not appear in our editions of the Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer, but  it appears in Tanḥuma, BeShalaḥ, 28. 34 One may argue that the reason to halt the sun in its orbit was to give the Israelites  more hours of daylight to fight Amaleq, but Levi shows that astrological consider- ations were the reason for this action, since Moses halted also the moon. 35 Levi cites a similar midrash found in Tanḥuma, Tetsaveh, 9. 36 That is to say, that the constellation of each of the warriors will be the same as  the ascending constellation at the time of the new moon, and this would rein- force their strength. 37 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 771-2.  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Prophecy of Moses  329 While in this passage Levi speaks at first as though the specific  commands come directly from God, it is clear from the continuation of  his remarks that Moses determined what actions were to be taken  based on his astrological knowledge, and that he conferred with Aaron  and Ḥur, who were also experts in this field. There are miracles that Levi apparently rejects any attempt to  explain in a naturalistic manner, such as the parting of the Sea of Reeds:  “God chose for the parting of the sea a time of moderate temperature,  and not a time of great coldness and dreadful frost, in order not to  give the heretics an opening to claim that this was a natural event,  since the intensity of the coldness froze the water.”38 Even in this case,  Levi may have still believed that there was a natural reason for the  event and Moses was able to predict its occurrence, but he did not want  to reveal this view given the significance of this miracle. Otherwise, it  is hard to explain why he is so persistent in presenting naturalistic  interpretations for many of the other biblical miracles. The most crucial question that remains is whether Levi held that  Moses himself was the author of the Torah as a result of the level of  prophecy that he attained. It is hardly surprising that Levi ascribes the  Torah to the immediate agency of God in his discussion of the topic.  Nevertheless, there are passages that may allude to a different view on  this issue. He writes, for example: “Some of the stories were written by  Moses in an allegoric manner and he designed them as parables by the  word of God [literally, the mouth of God,‘al pei HaShem] because of  necessity.”39 Levi attempts to solve the problem how the Torah can  contain parables if Moses’ prophecy did not involve the imaginative  faculty. He does not explain what he means, however, by the phrase  “by the word of God.” Does he in fact maintain that God commanded  Moses to write these stories exactly as He dictated them, and hence  Moses’ imagination was not involved, or is he hinting at the view  that Moses himself created the parables because he understood the  need to convey to the nation the truths he received in prophecy in this  manner, and this understanding is what Levi alludes to when he speaks  38 Livyat Ḥen: The Secrets of the Faith, 98. 39 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 224. </page> <page sequence="16"> 330 Chapter Nine of “the word of God”? As we shall see below, Levi’s approach to the  “voice” of God may throw some added light on this issue. Nissim of Marseille Following the Maimonidean tradition, Nissim treats Moses as an indi- vidual who attained ultimate human perfection and conjoined with  the Active Intellect, thereby meriting a prophecy that involved his  intellect alone without the use of his imagination.40 It is this unique  attainment that enabled him to govern the Israelites in a perfect  manner. While Maimonides, followed by Levi ben Avraham, leaves the  question of the precise relationship between Moses’ perfection and the  supernatural phenomena associated with his prophecy at least in part  open, Nissim’s stance on this issue lacks very little if any ambiguity.  Moses’ perfection enabled him to create the miracles and lay down a  law that alone may be considered divine. Nissim describes Moses’ perfection as follows: Moses, of blessed memory, actualized his intellect, till he was always  with God. God illuminated him by way of a radiant prism (aspaqlar- iyah me’irah), till the light of his intellect shone. He commanded  what he commanded and admonished what he admonished, and he  gave us a law and commandments by virtue of the good hand of his  Lord upon him, and in accordance with His command. He induced  the multitude to follow it by miracles and promises of good fortune,  awe inspiring miracles and terrible punishments. There remained no  perfection or what brings it about according to the intellect that he  had not taught and commanded us. He reached the pinnacle of  God’s purpose in the creation of humanity. He aspired to every  perfection that he could determine on the basis of divine science in  order to perfect the individual and protect him from the evils that  human beings inflict upon each other, and also those evils that they  inflict upon themselves as a result of bad choices.41 40 Nissim devotes chapter 12 of his treatise to a discussion of the prophecy of Moses  in relation to that of all other prophets. He also discusses Moses’ prophecy exten- sively throughout his work. 41 Ma‘aseh Nissim, 100. </page> <page sequence="17"> The Prophecy of Moses  331 Nissim shows in this passage the integral relation between intellectual  perfection, culminating in mastery of the divine science (metaphysics),  and perfect governance, including the laying down of an ideal law that  will lead others to perfection and minimize the evils they inflict on each  other and on themselves. Not only are Maimonides’ views on human  perfection and the purpose of the divine Law very much evident in this  passage,42 but just as striking is its similarity to Alfarabi’s description of  the supreme lawgiver in his The Political Regime,43 which heavily influ- enced Maimonides’ thought.44 Perhaps most astounding is the fact that  Nissim in this passage comes close to indicating explicitly that Moses  himself was the immediate author of the Law, and God only the remote  cause, a position that is echoed even more explicitly in other passages  of his work, as we have seen, and moreover, treated as the esoteric view  of the Sages.45 In keeping with his view that all miracles can be explained in a  manner that is in harmony with the natural order,46 Nissim explains  those performed by Moses. All of them consisted either of rare natural  phenomena that Moses was able to foresee and utilize for his purposes,  or they were phenomena that do not occur naturally but Moses acquired  the scientific knowledge that enabled him to bring them about. Many  of the explanations he borrowed from Levi’s encyclopedia, such as the  earthquake foreseen by Moses and utilized to destroy the followers of  Koraḥ, or his striking the rock to release the water which stood under- neath it.47 All of the plagues occurring in Egypt are given a naturalistic  42 See, in particular, Maimonides’ description of the purpose of the divine Law in  Guide 3.27, as well as his discussion of evil in 3.12. 43 See the quote brought above in chapter 2, 25-26. 44 See chapter 2, note 24. Nissim nowhere in his treatise cites explicitly from The  Political Regime, also known as The Principles of Existents, which was translated into  Hebrew by Moses Ibn Tibbon and with which he may well have been acquainted.  He does quote, however, from a different work of Alfarabi, The Classification of the  Sciences; see Ma‘aseh Nissim, 70-71. 45 See above, chapter 6, 172-173. 46 See above, chapter 6, 190-192. As noted in this chapter, there are passages in  which Nissim attacks the view that the Torah was not given to Israel by God, but  this stance does not appear to represent his private view on the subject and is  presented for religious reasons. 47 See Ma‘aseh Nissim, 416-418, 422-423. </page> <page sequence="18"> 332 Chapter Nine explanation, including the death of the first born,48 and several natural- istic explanations are proffered for the splitting of the Sea of Reeds.49 No medieval Jewish philosopher who remained faithful to Jewish  tradition came as close as Nissim in presenting such a radical natural- istic position in such an open manner. The Torah in Nissim’s view is a  divine law not because it came directly from God but because it was  legislated by the individual who attained the highest possible level of  human perfection, and guided its adherents towards this perfection in  an optimum manner. Nissim understands the necessity of teaching the  masses that God is the immediate author of the Torah, and even  labeling this belief a principle of faith,50 in order to insure their obedi- ence. Yet he clearly regards this belief as a noble lie, or what was termed  by Maimonides a “necessary belief,”51 in keeping with the Platonic  political tradition  Joseph Ibn Kaspi and the Critique by Kalonymos   ben Kalonymos Ibn Kaspi also appears to hold the view that Moses himself brought  about the miracles and laid down the Law as a result of the perfection  he attained, though he is careful not to make these points too explicit.52  Kalonymos, however, discerned from Ibn Kaspi’s remarks in Tirat  Kesef (Sefer ha-Sod) that this was in fact his view and wrote a scathing  48 Ibid., 309-317. 49 Ibid., 322. For some of these explanations see chapter 6, 202-203. 50 Ibid., 159-160. 51 See Guide 3.28. Maimonides distinguished these beliefs from “correct beliefs,” for  they are clearly false when understood literally, such as God is violently angry at  those who are unjust and He slays them.  52 For a discussion of the prophecy of Moses in the thought of Ibn Kaspi, see Barry  Mesch, Studies in Joseph Ibn Caspi (Leiden: Brill, 1975), 61-76. Mesch nicely summa- rizes Ibn Kaspi’s view of Moses’ perfection and its natural aspects. Moreover,  Mesch shows that Ibn Kaspi interprets Maimonides as agreeing with Aristotle  that the world is without beginning and God possesses no personal will (ibid.,  97-100). For a discussion of Ibn Kaspi’s approach to miracles, see Basil Herring’s  introduction to his edition of Joseph Ibn Kaspi, Gevi‘a Kesef (New York: Ktav  Publishing House, 1982), 99-122.  </page> <page sequence="19"> The Prophecy of Moses  333 critique against him.53 One may say that Kalonymos brought to light  what Ibn Kaspi wanted to leave obscure. In his explanation of Proverbs  30, Ibn Kaspi writes in the first chapter of his work: I am more brutish than a man [Proverbs 30:2]. He means to say by  this—than what is in the nature of the intellect of a person to grasp.54  We entertain no doubt that Moses our Master reached this final end  and his actions prove it. Solomon spoke of Moses’ marvelous actions  and said: Who has ascended up to heaven etc. [ibid., 4]. In general, he  spoke of the loftiest kinds of marvelous actions Moses performed,  which included those that were impossible by nature . . . . Undoubt- edly he acted upon the wind, and in general upon the element of air,  also upon the element of water, in accordance with his will, most of  these activities being impossible for us.55 Ibn Kaspi subsequently remarks: In general, the character of the action teaches the character of the  agent. Therefore one who understands all of our holy Torah believes  that Moses our Master, who was the foremost prophet, received it  from God or from the heavens, both are the same. He undoubtedly  reached the ultimate point of the perfection of the intellect of the  human species, and this point is the ultimate final perfection of the  prophetic perfection. When he reached this point, God, who is  completely intellect, transmitted to him His holy Torah.56 Kalonymos infers from Ibn Kaspi’s remarks, “that Moses our Master,  since he apprehended all of the existents completely, worked upon the  elements as he willed, and therefore his actions were so marvelous.  This general ability does not exist in the other individuals of the  53 See Kalonymos ben Kalonymos, Ha-Teshuvah le-Yosef Kaspi (Sendschreiben an  Joseph Caspi), ed. Joseph Perles (Munich, 1879). 54 In other words, Solomon indicates that he did not realize the full intellectual  potential of what the ideal human being is capable of realizing, hence he still is  chracterized by his animal nature. 55 Joseph Ibn Kaspi, Tirat Kesef, in Mishneh Kesef, vol. 1, ed. Isaac Last (Pressburg,  1905), 3. Compare Ibn Kaspi’s second commentary on Proverbs that appears in  Joseph Ibn Kaspi, ‘Asarah Kelei Kesef, vol. 1, ed.

The first he attributes to Avicenna. The soul of the prophet is  transformed into a type of world soul as a result of his conjunction  with the Active Intellect, and through his power of representation  while in this state he can work upon the elements as he wills. Kalon- ymos identifies this approach also with Ibn Ezra and admits that at one  point even he and his teachers accepted it.58 The second explanation  is the one he feels that Ibn Kaspi himself holds. The prophet knows  how to bring about miracles on the basis of the perfect scientific knowl- edge he has acquired of the world. Kalonymos rejects both explanations, the first for reasons that, as  he indicates, were brought by Averroes in his Incoherence of the Inco- herence against the notion that the power of representation can bring  about changes such as an entity being transformed from one species to  another. There are only two possible ways for existents to change from  one species to another: either their form emanates from the Active  Intellect, as was believed by the later philosophers—a reference to  Alfarabi and Avicenna—or the motion of the heavenly bodies completes  the process.59 In the latter case, there is no role for representation at all.  Even if we maintain that the Active Intellect bestows the forms, it is  only capable of acting when the heavenly motions prepare matter to  receive a given form. The Active Intellect works only in accordance  with nature, and God alone can change the heavenly motions.60 57 Ha-Teshuvah le-Yosef Kaspi, 4. 58 Ibid. For a discussion of Avicenna’s theory of miracles and its influence on medi- eval Jewish philosophy, see Ravitzky, “The Anthropological Theory of Miracles in  Medieval Jewish Philosophy,” 323-361.

Perles’ edition contains many faulty readings which  I have emended in my summary and translation. Kalonymos’ argument is in  </page> <page sequence="21"> The Prophecy of Moses  335 The second explanation, that superior knowledge of the world  enables one to bring about these changes, is also rejected, again for  reasons Kalonymos traces to Averroes. He argues that an infinite  number of preparations are necessary to bring about a small change in  nature and the human intellect is by nature incapable of discovering all  of them. Kalonymos concludes in the name of Averroes: When a prophet presents an activity impossible for man, even if it is  possible in nature, it is sufficient proof of the divine prophetic spirit  in him, in that he apprehends activities which speculation cannot  indicate. When you examine the miracles whose veracity is indicated  in the Law of Moses, the trustworthy prophet, you find them of this  kind, as in the transformation of a rod into a serpent, and the split- ting of the Sea of Reeds. There is no reason to assume that these  things are conceptually impossible; rather, they are possible in  nature, but impossible for all men except the prophet, since prophecy  bears no relation to speculation.61 At first blush, Kalonymos’ position appears similar to the one he is  attacking, for even those he critiques agree that only in the state of  conjunction is this special ability or knowledge attained. Yet the differ- ence between the two positions becomes clearer in the continuation of  the discussion. According to Kalonymos, God imparted to Moses knowl- edge of the specific miracles he was to bring about and Moses had  accordance with the principles of Islamic Aristotelian metaphysics. It does not,  however, appear in the versions of the Incoherence of the Incoherence that have  come down to us, neither in the Arabic (Tahafot-at-Tahafot, ed. Maurice Bouyges  [Beyrouth: Imprimie Catholique, 1930]), nor in the medieval Hebrew translation  (MS Vatican 520). None contain the argument against the individual performing  miracles by the power of representation. For Al-Ghazali’s discussion of miracles  and Averroes’ response, see Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut),  trans. Simon Van Den Bergh (London: Luzac and Company, 1954), vol. 1, 316-333. 61 Kalonymos, Ha-Teshuvah, 5. This argument too is not found in our versions of the  Incoherence of the Incoherence. While Averroes agrees that it is not in the power of  man or the Active Intellect to transform existents instantaneously, he appears to  place the limitation on God as well. See Incoherence of the Incoherence, 25ff., 332.  Averroes, however, condemns the discussion of the principles of religion in order  not to undermine them, because of the necessity of the virtues that religion incul- cates for human existence. He concludes: “Of religious principles it must be said  that they are divine things which surpass human understanding, but must be  acknowledged although their causes are unknown” (322).  </page> <page sequence="22"> 336 Chapter Nine no choice in the matter.62 Rather than regard Moses as an active, free- willing agent, as is the case with his opponents, Kalonymos treats him  as a passive instrument in carrying out the divine decree. Kalonymos was inspired to write his response not only due to Ibn  Kaspi’s remarks in Tirat Kesef but also because of what Ibn Kaspi wrote  to Kalonymos’ teachers. The fact that Kalonymos at one point was  attracted to this view also helps explain the fervor he feels in now  attacking it, lest others succumb to its lure. He summarizes Ibn Kaspi’s  approach based on these two sources, as well as his critique of it, as  follows: “I have no doubt that the Torah came from God not in the way  you maintain, for the prophecy that reached Moses our Master is conse- quent upon the final perfection, and not that it is the final point of the  final perfection.”63 There is no disagreement between Kalonymos and Ibn Kaspi  regarding the fact that Moses attained the final perfection of the human  species and that there is an integral connection between this unique  perfection and Moses’ miracles and the reception of the Torah. The  controversy focuses on the role of God. Ibn Kaspi in Kalonymos’ eyes  adopts a completely naturalistic position, and leaves no room for any  voluntary activity on the part of God. To Ibn Kaspi, human perfection  exists on a continuum, and the one who reaches the final point of this  continuum naturally attains the ability to perform miracles and lay  down a perfect legislation. To Kalonymos, God chooses to perform the  greatest of miracles and transmit the Torah only through the mediation  of one who has reached the final point of perfection, but in the final  analysis it is God who determines directly each of the miracles that  takes place as well as each of the commandments of the divine Law, a  view that echoes Maimonides’ explicit remarks on the subject, disre- garding the issue of whether he held an esoteric position.64 62 Kalonymos, Ha-Teshuvah, 5. 63 Ibid., 5 64 See, in particular, Guide 2.25. Moreover, Maimonides treats the belief in God’s  authorship of every work in the Torah as a principle of faith; see his Introduction to  Pereq Ḥeleq, eighth principle. </page> <page sequence="23"> The Prophecy of Moses  337 Kalonymos appears to have discerned correctly Ibn Kaspi’s secret  position. Though there are passages in which Ibn Kaspi treats some of  the miracles as supernatural activities performed by God, he nonethe- less maintains that many of the miracles that are treated as supernatural  occurrences are characterized so because of our ignorance of the natural  causes that bring them about. Even Moses’ miracles were possible in  nature in his view, though he cannot explain how they were performed.65  It is this radical naturalistic approach that appears to leave no room at  all for personal divine volition that Kalonymos rejects despite his  attraction to philosophy. Ibn Kaspi’s naturalistic approach to the phenomena associated  with Mosaic prophecy perhaps finds its most explicit expression in his  treatise Gevi‘a Kesef. There he interprets the voice heard by Moses in  the Tabernacle as referring to what he attained by way of the emana- tion to the intellect. Notice how profusely he spoke with him [Numbers 7:89], which is an  allusion to Moses himself. For where is God mentioned [in the verse]  in order that it allude to Him? But Moses spoke with himself and his  essence, which is his intellect, and the “voice” refers to intellectual  emanation. All this is clear to the wise.66  Even the Torah, Ibn Kaspi indicates in several passages in his treatise,  was written by Moses as a result of his prophetic attainment, with God  serving as the remote agent.67 Levi Gersonides While Levi ben Avraham, Nissim of Marseille and Joseph Ibn Kaspi  view Moses as the perfect individual who by virtue of his intellectual  attainment was capable of performing miracles, and it appears was  even capable of legislating a divine law, Gersonides rejects this  65 See Tirat Kesef, 11ff., 135. In his esoteric commentary on the Guide, Maskiyot Kesef,  Ibn Kaspi also appears to ascribe to Moses this ability, hence the descent of the  Glory of God, which refers to the cloud, upon the Tabernacle is treated as a product  of Moses’ activity; see Maskiyot Kesef, 20-1, 29.  66 Gevi‘a Kesef, 41. 67 Ibid., 10, 13, 16. </page> <page sequence="24"> 338 Chapter Nine approach. As in the case of his philosophic predecessors, he agrees  that Moses in fact reached the highest level of human perfection and  merited receiving a form of prophecy that involved solely the intellect  without the mediation of the imagination.68 In general, Gersonides  accepts Maimonides’ descriptions of Moses’ perfection, with a  number of changes due to his approach to the manner that prophecy  is attained.69 Moreover, Gersonides rejects the idea that the human  being can reach a state of union with the Active Intellect, for he holds  that it is impossible to attain complete knowledge of the world order  that characterizes this transcendental intellect and is a condition for  uniting with it.70 Still, in his commentary on Numbers 12:8 he depicts  Moses as coming very close to this level: Due to their conjunction with matter, the other prophets appre- hended from the order of existents as it exists in God only that part  to which their thought was inclined. Together with this, Moses  apprehended all that is possible for a person to apprehend from this  conceptual order, and by means of this wondrous apprehension he  conjoined with God and apprehended an aspect of His wondrous  68 See Gersonides’ discussion of Mosaic prophecy in The Wars of the Lord 2.6 (trans.  Seymour Feldman [Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1987], vol. 2, 57-59);  see also his commentary on Numbers 12:8 (Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, ed. Jacob  Lev Levy [Jerusalem: Mossad HaRav Kook, 1998], vol. 4, 42-43). For a study of  Mosaic prophecy in Gersonides’ thought, see Menachem Kellner, “Maimonides  and Gersonides on Mosaic Prophecy,” Speculum 52 (1977): 62-79; and Kreisel, “The  Prophecy of Moses in Medieval Jewish Philosophy,” 129-133. For a discussion of  Gersonides’ approach to prophecy in general, see Prophecy: The History of an Idea  in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 316-424. 69 For example, Gersonides adds the prophet’s ability to “isolate” his intellect  together with the imaginative faculty from the other faculties of the soul. On the  idea of “isolation” (hitbodedut) in the philosophy of Gersonides, see Sara Klein- Braslavy, “Prophecy, Clairvoyance, and Dreams and the Concept of ‘Hitbodedut’  in Gersonides’ Thought,” Daat 39 (1997): 23-68 (Heb.). It should be noted that  Gersonides presents a much more detailed, and it appears different, description  of the roles of the Active Intellect and the faculties of the soul in the bestowal  and reception of prophecy than does Maimonides. See Prophecy: The History of  an Idea in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 358-390.  70 “Conjunction” (devekut) in the writings of Gersonides does not indicate an  ontological state, but the level of perfection of the intellect by virtue of which  a person merits prophecy or miracles occurring on his behalf. For a study of this  topic, see Seymour Feldman, “Gersonides on the Possibility of Conjunction  with the Agent Intellect,” AJS Review 3 (1978): 99-120. </page> <page sequence="25"> The Prophecy of Moses  339 figure. This was due to the ease of the isolation of his intellect from  the other faculties of the soul, till he was always with God and he  was only able to break away from this conjunction with great diffi- culty, as we explained at the beginning of Exodus.71 Yet even in this source Gersonides rejects the possibility to grasp the  Separate Intellects, ipso facto to grasp God, and he limits Moses’ appre- hension to the entire order of the material world.72 While Gersonides sees an integral connection between Moses’  perfection and the miracles that were performed through him, as well  as his reception of the Torah, he does not view Moses as the agent of  the miracles or the author of the Torah. In his discussion of miracles at  the end of The Wars of the Lord, he brings a list of arguments to show  that the Active Intellect is the immediate agent of the miracles, not  God or the prophet himself.73 The question of who is the immediate  source of the Torah is not addressed by Gersonides in his philosophical  treatise. In his Commentary on the Torah, he attributes the Torah and  the miracles to God, but in keeping with his position in The Wars of the  Lord, one should interpret him as viewing God as their remote cause,  just as God is the remote cause of all that occurs in the world, and not  their immediate cause. Should one then also attribute the legislation of  the Torah to the Active Intellect? It would appear that this is the  conclusion to which Gersonides’ approach leads, with all the problems  that attach to this position from both a religious and a philosophical  71 Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, vol. 4, 42-43. Compare his commentary on Exodus  33:30: “. . . Till Moses became like a simple intellect and did not sense physical  things” (Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, vol. 2, 432). See also his commentary on  Exodus 4:10. As opposed to Maimonides, though similar to the interpretation  Maimonides attributes to Onqelos, Gersonides interprets the “face” of God as  referring to the Separate Intellects; cf. Guide 1.37; 1.54. 72 Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, vol. 2, 434 (commentary on Exodus 33:20). 73 The Wars of the Lord 6.2.10 (vol. 3, 474-486). </page> <page sequence="26"> 340 Chapter Nine perspective.74 Gersonides, however, is very careful to hide this conclu- sion from the readers of his Torah commentary.75 Gersonides’ approach to miracles, comparable to his approach to  prophecy, is integrally related to his theory of divine providence.  Prophecy and miracles result from the impersonal activity of the Active  Intellect. Prophecy, which is one of the expressions of divine provi- dence, reaches the one who has completed all the necessary preparations  in order to attain this emanation from the Active Intellect, without the  Active Intellect being cognizant of the recipient. Similarly, the miracle  is performed on behalf of one who has reached the level of perfection  that renders them worthy of this phenomenon, without the Active  Intellect being cognizant of the one whose perfection sets off the prov- idential order to the extent that miracles occur for the benefit of this  individual. This order is different than the natural order and neutral- izes it, though it too is impersonal. Therefore Gersonides, as distinct  from his predecessors, does not attempt to explain miracles in terms of  the workings of the natural order, such as by ascribing to the prophet a  natural ability to bring about the miracle in one way or another. Rather,  he thinks that the miracle results from a type of activity that has no  naturalistic explanation yet at the same time it is not the effect of a  personal act of volition, neither of the Active Intellect nor of God. His  approach to divine providence in general and to miracles in particular  74 Ḥasdai Crescas pointed out the philosophical problems in Gersonides’ approach in  his effort to show these actions must be ascribed to the personal activity of God,  who knows individuals qua individuals. According to Crescas, Gersonides has no  coherent explanation for how the Active Intellect, which does not know individ- uals qua individuals, can perform specific miracles for a specific person or group.  See Or HaShem 2.2.1-3; 3.1.5. For a discussion of this point, see Prophecy: The  History of an Idea in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 439-443. Crescas devotes the sixth  part of the third section of his treatise to a detailed discussion of the prophecy of  Moses; see ibid., 431-435, 471-477. 75 Several scholars have explored Gersonides’ Commentary on the Torah and the rela- tion between the views he presents there and those found in his philosophical  treatise, The Wars of the Lord. See the bibliography compiled by Menachem  Kellner, “Bibliographia Gersonideana,” in Studies on Gersonides—A Four- teenth-Century Jewish Philosopher-Scientist, ed.

In his Commentary on the Torah, Gersonides treats the prophecy of  Moses as miraculous. For example, he writes in his commentary on  Deuteronomy, chapter 4 (the eighth lesson): This comes to inform us that Moses did not merit this highest level  of prophecy due to the advantage of his natural preparedness to  attain the emanation of prophecy . . . since others may also come to  possess this [level of] preparedness. For this is possible in the species,  as has been explained in the natural sciences. The holy Torah clari- fied that there never will be a prophet who transmits a Torah aside  from Moses, of blessed memory. Therefore it is clear that God by  way of a miracle was responsible for the magnitude of the level of  prophecy of Moses, in order that the Torah be transmitted by him,  just as the matter of the Gathering at Sinai was by way of a miracle.  . . . For this reason, it is fitting that you know that when we said in  the portion of Balaq that another prophet like Moses will arise in  Israel and in the rest of the nations, and he is the king messiah for  whom we hope, we did not mean to say that he will be a prophet  transmitting a Torah, for this is impossible. It is not by way of  prophecy qua prophecy to proclaim a divine Law, except in a mirac- ulous way as in the case of the prophecy of Moses. Rather, what we  meant to say is that he will be similar to him, or even superior, in the  matters that are mentioned there—namely, the creation of signs and  miracles and the rest of the matters that ensue, as it is stated: There  did not arise in Israel another prophet like Moses [Deuteronomy 34:10].76 Gersonides expands upon this point at the end of his Commentary on  the Torah (Deuteronomy, chapter 34, the fifteenth lesson): Perhaps one will raise an objection and say: Why is it not possible  that a different prophet will transmit a Torah as did Moses? How  could the Torah have decreed that this Torah will never change and  that nothing will be added to it or deleted from it? For if this is the  case, the capacity he possesses [the prophet who is as perfect as  Moses] to be a prophet who transmits a Torah is in vain. The answer  to this is that no one will be equal to Moses in this matter. For his  76 Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, vol. 5, 27-28; cf. vol. 4, 136-137 (Numbers, chap. 25,  the second lesson).  </page> <page sequence="28"> 342 Chapter Nine prophecy to transmit the Torah is miraculous, and does not belong to  the capacity of a prophet qua prophet, if it was not by way of a  miracle. God clarified that it is not His will to create a different  Torah, or to add to it or delete from it a permanent addition or dele- tion. In this manner the objection is removed.77 According to Gersonides, the prophet for whom miracles like those of  Moses will be performed is the king messiah. It is with a description of  the messiah and his miracles that Gersonides chooses to conclude his  commentary,78 a subject that is intended to instill hope in his reader.  One should not conclude from what he writes concerning the Torah  and miracles in his Commentary on the Torah that Gersonides rejected  the approach he presented earlier in The Wars of the Lord regarding  God’s impersonal activity. These miracles took place due to not only  the perfection of the prophet, whether Moses or the king messiah, but  also the providence the nation as a whole deserved to receive, or the  merits of their forefathers.79 Gersonides was of the opinion that this  explanation was adequate from a philosophical perspective to accept  the occurrence of all the miracles mentioned in the Torah, the miracles  that according to tradition were to take place at the time of the final  redemption, as well as the Torah itself as a law that was bestowed upon  Moses from on high. It follows from Gersonides’ analysis that the prov- idential order, though it is an impersonal one, for both God and the  Active Intellect do not know individuals qua individuals, still operates  in a personal manner. The most manifest expression of this can be  discerned in all the phenomena that are connected with the prophecy  of Moses. The Voice of God80 Perhaps no supernatural phenomenon mentioned in the Torah better  illustrates God’s ability to act directly in history than the heavenly  77 Ibid., vol. 5, 351. 78 Ibid., 352 (the nineteenth lesson).

It should be noted that my  </page> <page sequence="29"> The Prophecy of Moses  343 voice heard by Israel at Sinai. Given the fact that all the medieval  Jewish philosophers accepted the view that God was incorporeal and  hence possessed no physical organs, God could not be conceived as  actually speaking. R. Saadiah’s solution to this difficulty was to treat  the speech as audible sounds that were created by God in the air, a  solution that has its roots in the Aramaic translation of Onqelos to the  Torah.81 R. Saadiah does not confine this phenomenon to the revelation  at Sinai and to the private revelations to Moses. He treats the speech  heard by prophets in general as created speech, often accompanied  by the appearance of the Created Glory.82 The notions of created  speech and the Created Glory not only serve to solve the problem of  anthropomorphism, but they also provide an empirical means for the  prophet to verify that he is fact receiving a communication from God— the five senses in R. Saadiah’s view being a source of reliable knowledge.83  The implication of this approach is that God is personally involved in  every transmission of prophecy—God chooses each prophet individu- ally, and creates the actual words heard by him. In regard to normative prophecy, Maimonides rejects this approach,  considering instead the sights and sounds experienced by the prophet  as resulting from an emanation to the imaginative faculty.84 Thus they  have no reality outside the prophet’s soul. As for the revelation at Sinai  and the speech of God to Moses, however, he appears to accept the  view of audible created speech, which in turn entails that the imme- diate agent of every word of the Torah is in fact God. This is precisely  interpretation of Maimonides was later advanced independently by Jacob Levinger  in Maimonides as Philosopher and Codifier, 39-48. 81 For a study of R. Saadiah’s theory of the created voice, see Alexander Altmann,  “Saadya’s Theory of Revelation: its Origin and Background,” in Saadya Studies, ed.  E. I. J.

See also Prophecy: The History of an Idea in  Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 56-85. 82 Book of Beliefs and Opinions 2.12. R.

It is also the  view that he presents in Mishneh Torah., Laws of Principles of the  Torah 8.1 in reference to the revelation at Sinai. The necessity of this  view for upholding the Israelites’ belief in the Torah as a divine law is  clear. The question remains whether this is also Maimonides’ personal  view on the matter. In several passages in the Guide Maimonides refers to the divine  voice, treating it as audible, and at times referring to it as created. For  the most part he utilizes this notion to negate corporeality from God.  For example, in his discussion of the verb ‘abor (to pass) in Guide 1.21  he presents Onqelos’ interpretation of Exodus 34:6, And God passed by  before his face and called—that God caused His Indwelling to pass  before Moses. Maimonides then adds: You are free to believe whatever belief you wish. You may believe  that the great station attained by [Moses] was indubitably, in its  entirety, a vision of prophecy and that he solely desired intellectual  apprehensions—everything, namely, that which he had demanded,  that which was denied to him, and that which he apprehended,  being intellectual and admitting of no recourse to the senses, as we  interpreted in the first place. Or you may believe that there was, in  addition to this intellectual apprehension, an apprehension due to  the sense of sight, which, however, had for its object a created thing,  through seeing which the perfection of intellectual perfection may  be achieved. . . . Or again you may believe that there was in addition  an apprehension due to the sense of hearing; that which passed by  before his face being the voice, which is likewise indubitably a created  thing. Choose whatever opinion you wish, inasmuch as our only  purpose is that you should not believe that when Scripture says, in  the verse we are discussing, He “passed by,” the phrase is analogous  to: Pass before the people [Exodus 17:5]. For God, may He be honored  and magnified, is not a body, and it is not permitted to ascribe  motion to Him. (50-51) Maimonides clearly prefers the first opinion, that the senses of sight  and hearing were not involved at all in Moses’ prophecy, but the other  interpretations at least negate from God corporeality and thus provide  </page> <page sequence="31"> The Prophecy of Moses  345 legitimate alternatives. One should note that in addition to Exodus  34:6, Maimonides also cites in this chapter Numbers 7:89: And he  heard the voice speaking to him, referring to the voice Moses heard in  the Tabernacle between the two cherubs. This suggests that both verses  are to be interpreted in a similar manner. Moreover, in the same  context he brings a further example of a divine voice calling to a  prophet, Isaiah 40:6. Subsequently in his discussion of prophecy he  clarifies that Isaiah’s prophetic visions resulted from an emanation to  the imagination,85 hence no audible voice was heard by Isaiah at all.  This supports the conclusion that Maimonides did not think that an  audible created voice was involved even in the case of Moses. In other  passages too, in which he cites verses depicting a voice addressing  Moses, his concern is to negate the interpretation of God as corpo- real.86 The notion of an audible voice created by God thus is of great  benefit to the belief of the masses in Maimonides’ view, even if he  himself does not accept it and hints that Moses’ prophecy consisted  solely of intellectual apprehensions.87 85 Guide 2.44-45. 86 Ibid., 1.37, 65. 87 In a letter to Ḥasdai Halevi, written in Hebrew, purportedly by a disciple of  Maimonides in Maimonides’ name, there is a discussion of the voice heard by  Moses. Maimonides labels it a “created voice” that issued forth from the cloud.  Yet he also brings the interpretation in the name of “many others” that the voice  was not a sensible one, but “the soul of Moses our Master grasped the supernal  theoretical intelligibles and understood and ‘heard’ in the true manner the meaning  of the divine intelligibles.” Maimonides indicates that if Scripture had not explic- itly taught: And he heard the voice speaking to him (Numbers 7:89), he would have  agreed with this interpretation. See Isaac Shailat (ed. and Heb. trans.), Iggerot  HaRambam (Jerusalem: Ma‘aliyot, 1987), 680. The argument that the literal  meaning of Scripture compelled Maimonides to reject the interpretation that the  “voice” was not a sensible one is certainly problematic. Maimonides after all  refrains from interpreting the voice heard by the other prophets as an audible  created one. It would appear that the opinion Maimonides mentions and rejects is  in fact his esoteric opinion, as can be seen by the questionable reason he gives  for dismissing it. It should be noted that a number of scholars question the authen- ticity of this letter. Shailat too views it as a fake, though he does not rule out the  possibility that parts of it are based on authentic responses by Maimonides; see  ibid., 675.  </page> <page sequence="32"> 346 Chapter Nine The voice heard by Israel at Sinai poses a greater difficulty, for in  this case an entire nation was reported to have heard the voice, and on  the basis of this event they accepted the Torah. It is significant that in  the first part of the Guide Maimonides brings the verse regarding the  Gathering at Sinai: And all the people saw the sounds (Exodus 20:15) to  illustrate the notion that, “although this station constituted a vision of  prophecy, as is well known and universally admitted in our commu- nity, action and speech are ascribed to God so that an overflow  proceeding from Him should thereby be indicated” (Guide 1.46: 100).  The labeling of the Gathering at Sinai as “a vision of prophecy” hints  at the manner in which Maimonides understands this event, though it  remains unclear how an entire nation can collectively experience a  vision that does not involve one’s external senses. One, however, may  counter this interpretation by arguing that Maimonides is using the  notion of “vision” here in a loose manner, not in its precise sense, and  he certainly does not wish to deny the literal truth of the Torah’s  description of this event.  Maimonides’ comments concerning the Gathering at Sinai in the  context of his discussion of prophecy throw some further light on this  issue. In Guide 2.32, Maimonides distinguishes between the reception  of prophecy at Sinai, which was solely in accordance with the prepared- ness of each individual, and the great fire and terrifying sounds that  everyone there witnessed. Only the latter phenomena are labeled by  Maimonides as miraculous, suggesting that they did in fact occur in  reality. In the following chapter he distinguishes the sounds and light- ning from the voice of God, “I mean the created voice from which the  speech [of God] was understood” (Guide 2.33: 365). The use of the  term “created voice” certainly implies an audible voice, but Maimon- ides had already shown his inclination to understand God’s “voice” as  signifying an emanation from God. In an attempt to uphold the prin- ciple that all individuals receive from the emanation what they are  prepared to receive, Maimonides brings two different interpretations  of what the people heard from the divine voice at Sinai. According to  the first interpretation, they heard a great sound but no articulated  words at all, indicating that none of them received prophecy but they  </page> <page sequence="33"> The Prophecy of Moses  347 all relied completely on the prophecy of Moses. According to the  rabbinic view, however, the people heard the actual words of the first  two Commandments. This interpretation is not favored by Maimon- ides, but he nonetheless points out that even according to this view  the people heard what they were prepared to hear, for the first two  Commandments could be known by demonstration, and “everything  that can be known by demonstration, the status of the prophet and that  of everyone else who knows it are equal” (364). In this manner he shows  that according to the view of the Sages the Israelites were prepared to  receive/apprehend the existence of the one God independent of Moses’  prophecy. Maimonides’ discussion at least suggests the possibility that  while one should interpret the Israelites’ gathering around Mount Sinai  literally, their hearing of divine speech is a parable signifying an expe- rience of collective enlightenment, rather than the actual hearing of an  audible heavenly voice. This unique gathering resulted in the accep- tance of the Ten Commandments and the law transmitted by Moses on  the basis of what the Israelites witnessed and apprehended there. As for the miraculous phenomena that took place during this gath- ering, Maimonides, in the course of a later discussion regarding the  difficulty of grasping that which is separate from matter, brings a report   on the weather conditions at Sinai at the time the Ten Commandments  were received: “It is, moreover, well known and generally accepted in  the religious community that the day of the Gathering at Mount Sinai  was a day of clouds, of mist, and of a light rain” (Guide 3.9: 437).  Maimonides interprets this description as a parable signifying “that the  apprehension of His true reality is impossible for us because of the dark  matter that encompasses us and not Him.” In this context he treats the  Gathering at Sinai as “greater than any vision of prophecy and  beyond any analogy.” While Maimonides’ stance serves to highlight  the uniqueness of the event, more importantly it comes to preempt the  interpretation that denies the veracity of the event by treating it solely  as a parable, similar to all other prophetic visions, insofar as “every- thing that is apprehended in a vision of prophecy is only a parable for  some notion.” One may conclude that Maimonides intimates here that  the miraculous fires and terrifying sounds witnessed at Sinai in truth  </page> <page sequence="34"> 348 Chapter Nine resulted from the highly unusual weather conditions at the time. The  story of the Gathering at Sinai thus is literally true, as opposed to  prophetic visions in general, but the miracles accompanying this gath- ering were in fact rare natural events. This leaves open the possibility  that the supernatural heavenly voice, on the other hand, should be  interpreted in Maimonides’ view solely as a parable, similar to the  notion of hearing a divine voice or divine speech in other prophetic  visions, signifying what transpired in the souls of each Israelite in the  course of this collective experience. The problem of the voice heard by Moses and the one heard by all  of Israel at Sinai occupied Maimonides’ followers in Provence, whom  we have explored in this chapter. Levi ben Avraham relies on Maimon- ides’ analysis of the term “face” in Guide 1.37 to explain that God’s  speech to Moses “face to face” signifies that the revelation came to him  without the intermediary of an angel, clarifying what Maimonides  leaves veiled. He writes: Moses would grasp the Intellects and hear the pure speech from the  emanation of the last of the angels—namely, the Active Intellect— without the mediation of an angel, that is to say, without the use of  the imagination, as it is stated: And the figure of God he looks upon  [Numbers 12:8], and it is stated: God spoke to Moses face to face  [Exodus 33:11], and it is stated: mouth to mouth [Numbers 12:8].  This indicates conjunction with the Active Intellect.88 By regarding the speech Moses heard as pure speech that is the  product of his conjunction with the Active Intellect, Levi rejects  the notion that Moses heard an audible voice. The more difficult problem of the voice heard by the nation is  addressed by Levi in the course of his discussion of the Giving of  the Torah. He commences by presenting the classic view of the  voice—namely, that it was a created audible voice. Maimonides had  brought this view in the name of Onqelos, but R. Saadiah is the one  who presents it most explicitly as we have seen. Drawing upon  88 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 138.  </page> <page sequence="35"> The Prophecy of Moses  349 Maimonides’ discussion in Guide 2.33, but with R. Saadiah’s  approach in mind, Levi writes: The voice that Moses heard was a created voice that God created  from the air, hence Onqelos translated, and God answered him with  a voice [Exodus 19:19]: “On the part of God he was answered by a  voice.” He translated, but let not the Lord speak with us [Exodus  20:16]: “[Speech] should not be spoken on the part of God.” Israel  also understood that the speech of God was by a created voice  without a body, as it is stated: And a figure you do not see, only a voice  [Deuteronomy 4:12].89 Yet side by side with this interpretation Levi brings an exceptionally  radical interpretation, though not in his own name: There was one who interpreted that God aided and gave power to  Moses to make his voice heard to the people, as in the literary usage  [of the term “answer”]: money answers every need [Ecclesiastes 10:19].  This is the reason it is written: He heard the voice speaking (middaber)  with him [Numbers 7:89], and it does not say: “speaking (meddaber)  to him,” from the intensive form of the word, but middaber from the  reflexive. . . . It is possible that the [voice] came forth from the cloud.  This is seen from the fact that via a cloud the revelation came to him,  as Scripture clarifies by indicating: And when Moses entered the Tent  the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the Tent and spoke  with Moses [Exodus 33:9], and indicating: Behold I come to you in a  thick cloud [ibid., 9]. According to this interpretation, an audible voice was in fact heard at  Sinai by the people, but the voice belonged to Moses when he was on  top of the mountain. This phenomenon is tied up with the thick cloud,  which apparently, in the mind of the interpreter, served to amplify  Moses’ voice. Levi brings yet another interpretation, reiterating the one he had  already brought regarding the voice heard by Moses, but this time not  as his own view: There was one who understood God’s speech with Moses as being  without sounds at all, as is the case with the other prophets, but  89 Ibid., 199. </page> <page sequence="36"> 350 Chapter Nine his intellect grasped the [Separate] Intellects, received emanation,  and apprehended knowledge of the Supernal, in accordance with  what is possible for one at the highest level of humanity. This  [internal] intellectual speech and conception of the intelligibles is  what Scripture terms “voice.” For this reason, He heard the voice  speaking (middaber) with him [Numbers 7:89], is in the reflexive  conjugation . . . .90 Levi indicates that he favors the interpretation that Scripture refers to  a created audible voice by means of which God spoke to Moses, but he  goes on to indicate that the speech (dibbur) heard by Moses alone signi- fies conjunction.91 He thus leaves it an open question how he understood  the voice heard by Moses, let alone the one heard by all of Israel. It is precisely the radical interpretation of the voice of God  presented by Levi in the name of others that Nissim of Marseille adopts  and presents as his own, and moreover as the esoteric view of the  greatest of the Sages: “Why then does it say: Moses spoke [and God answered him by a  voice] [Exodus 19:19]? It merely teaches that Moses was endowed  with strength and force, and that God helped him with a voice, so  that Moses could let Israel hear the same tone which he himself  heard [Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Tractate Baḥodesh, 4].”92 This  shows that Rabbi Akiva understood the term “answered him”  (ya‘anenu) as in: The Lord shall answer (ya‘aneh) the wellbeing of  Pharaoh [Genesis 41:16], which signifies—will agree to and assist in  his wellbeing.93 Thus by the power of God issued forth a created  thing that speaks, which assisted Moses’ voice from on top of the  mountain, so that it was heard by Israel on the bottom of the moun- tain as a mighty sound, as a voice created in the air of the heavenly  90 Ibid., 202. 91 Ibid., 202-203. It should be noted that a similar ambiguity characterizes Levi’s  treatment of the tablets upon which were engraved the Ten Commandments.  Though he appears to favor the supernatural interpretation that God engraved the  first set of tablets, it is not entirely clear from his discussion whether this is his  actual view. See ibid., 252, 257-258. Compare to Maimonides’ treatment of this  topic in Guide 1.66. 92 Jacob Z. Lauterbach (trans.), Mekilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Philadelphia: Jewish Publi- cation Society, 1933), vol. 2, 223. 93 Compare to David Kimchi’s interpretation of the verse in his Commentary on the  Torah. </page> <page sequence="37"> The Prophecy of Moses  351 firmament. And the “tone” Moses would hear, that is to say, by way  of prophecy and the intellect that emanated upon him, he would let  Israel hear with the aid of an object of God that would amplify his  voice and strengthen it with a created voice that would reach the  ears of the people.94 While Nissim frames his comments in a somewhat ambiguous manner,  there can be little doubt that he is alluding here to the view that the  voice heard by the people was in fact Moses’ own voice. Moses received  his prophecy on top of the mountain solely by his intellect in the form  of internal speech, and he was able to convey the contents of his  prophecy to the Israelites below by way of a “created voice”—namely,  a natural object that he discovered on the top of the mountain that he  was able to use in order to amplify his voice and make it sound like a  created voice descending from heaven upon the people below.95 Nissim  in this manner attempts to buttress the interpretation he found in  Livyat Ḥen by introducing an object that enabled Moses to make his  voice heard to the nation. He undoubtedly felt that this subterfuge  was necessary in order to instill in the hearts of the masses obedience  to the laws Moses laid down as a result of the pure illumination of the  intellect that he attained. In his various treatises, Ibn Kaspi devotes very little attention to  the problem of the voice heard by Moses or that by all of Israel. In a  brief remark in Tirat Kesef, he indicates that the sounds and fire actu- ally occurred during the Gathering at Sinai by the will of God, but does  not enter into more detail.96 His esoteric commentary on the Guide,  Maskiyot Kesef, provides a few hints to his view on this issue. In his  commentary on Guide 1.5, he reiterates the notion that the phenomena  depicted as occurring at Sinai were in fact experienced by the senses,  and hints that they were the product of Moses’ activity.97 His juxtapo- sition of the Created Light or Glory, which he treats as natural  94 Ma‘aseh Nissim, 333. 95 Nissim may be thinking of some large horn-like object.  96 Tirat Kesef, 140-1. 97 Maskiyot Kesef, 20-21. </page> <page sequence="38"> 352 Chapter Nine phenomena, such as the cloud descending upon the Tabernacle,98 with  the Created Voice suggests that he views the voice heard at Sinai by the  nation as an audible one that was also brought about by Moses, though  he does not state so explicitly. In his commentary on Guide 2.33, he  elaborates upon Maimonides’ interpretation of Onqelos, that what  was heard by the nation was an entity that spoke, not God, but adds  nothing to the nature of this existent and how it came about.99 Gersonides also views the voice heard by the nation at Sinai as an  audible one, which he treats as a miracle. In his commentary on Exodus  19:19 he writes: The sound of the trumpet became increasingly stronger, and this  phenomenon was a supreme miracle. Still another miracle was  created there. Moses spoke with God, and when God answered him  by way of prophecy, there was created an audible sound of speech,  which Israel heard, and it became clear to them that God spoke with  Moses. The creation of a sound of speech without the organ of  speech is similar to the creation of a serpent from a rod. That is to  say, the existence of a sound of speech is not impossible in itself, but  it is impossible in nature for it to be created without an organ. Thus  its creation was by way of a miracle.100 Gersonides had already explained at the end of The Wars of the Lord  that the immediate agent of miracles is the Active Intellect, which are  performed by it as result of the level of perfection attained by the  prophet.101  98 Not in all cases does Ibn Kaspi treat the Created Glory as a substance existing  outside the soul of the prophet. Often it is beheld by the prophet in a vision, hence  it is the product of his imagination. Ibn Kaspi prefers the former explanation when  others also witness the Glory.  99 Ibid., 114. In Tirat Kesef, 140-141, Ibn Kaspi treats the voices and fires at Sinai as  phenomena created by God and perceived by the senses, suggesting that this is  also the case with the voice decreeing the Ten Commandments. His discussion in  Gevi‘a Kesef, 148, on the other hand, suggests that the speech of God at Sinai does  not refer to an audible voice, but to the emanation from the Active Intellect. As for  the private prophecy to Moses, Ibn Kaspi’s comments in this case too suggest that  no audible voice was heard, but he does not state so explicitly. 100 Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, vol. 2, 142. 101 The voice Moses alone heard at Sinai in the cleft of the rock (Exodus 34:6), on the  other hand, is treated as one heard in a vision—that is to say, it was not an audible  </page> <page sequence="39"> The Prophecy of Moses  353 Conclusion The question that challenged the Jewish philosophers that I dealt with  in this chapter is whether miracles and the Torah can be explained in a  manner that is in harmony with Aristotle’s naturalistic approach to the  world order. Some of the Provençal philosophers thought that the Aris- totelian approach could be broadened to provide an explanation for the  occurrence of miracles, a task that was already accomplished by the  Islamic philosopher Avicenna. One should view the prophet himself as  the immediate agent of the miracles by virtue of the level of speculative  knowledge he attained and perhaps also by virtue of a special power of  the soul to affect matter that is outside his own body The legislation of  the Torah one can ascribe to Moses by virtue of the complete knowl- edge of the world order that he attained, and his ability to employ this  knowledge in order to legislate a perfect law that directs the nation  toward human perfection. While Levi, Nissim, and Ibn Kaspi appear to  favor this approach, Nissim less ambiguously than the other two  thinkers, both Kalonymos and Gersonides reject it for different reasons.  The philosophic reasons Kalonymos advances against this approach  ultimately serve to bolster the traditional view that attributes miracles  and the Torah to the personal volition of God. For Gersonides, the  philosophical inadequacy of the approach that views Moses as the  immediate agent of these phenomena calls for the development of a  different philosophical approach. He posits a providential order beyond  the natural order. In this order, the Active Intellect is the immediate  agent of acts of providence, such as miracles. These acts are not  regarded by Gersonides as natural ones. From this standpoint, Moses’  perfection belongs to the natural order, while his prophecy belongs to  the order of divine providence. Nevertheless, he sees the providential  activity of the Active Intellect, as is true of all of its other activities, as  impersonal, lacking all cognizance of the recipients of its activity. The  perfection attained by an individual or a collective is responsible for  activating its providential activity. We thus may label this order as a  verse.

From a modern perspective, one can say that  despite the significant difference between Gersonides’ approach and  that of other philosophers discussed in this chapter, a difference that  allows Gersonides to consider the phenomena that are tied to Moses’  prophecy to be “supernatural,” the aim of his approach is the same—to  distance from God all personal activities, that is to say, activities that  God directs to an individual qua individual, and yet sill propose an  explanation that allows the acceptance of Moses’ miracles, the creation  of a heavenly voice and the Giving of the Torah. Appendix: Some Comments on Maimonides’  Approach to Miracles In the Guide, Maimonides does not devote a detailed discussion to the  topic of miracles but reveals his opinion in a number of comments,  most of them found in the context of his discussion of creation and his  discussion of the differences between the miracles of Moses and  those of the other prophets.102 On one hand he maintains: “Know that  with a belief in the creation of the world in time, all the miracles become  possible” (Guide 2.25: 329). On the other hand he praises the Sages who  were of the opinion: Miracles too are something that is, in a certain respect, in nature.  They say that when God created that which exists and stamped  102 Maimonides’ most detailed discussion of miracles is at the end of his Treatise on  Resurrection and at the end of his Medical Aphorisms in his short Treatise Contra  Galen. Both these treatise were written after the Guide and both of them contain  an apologetic component, with the view of defending God’s ability to work mira- cles against the naturalistic approach of the philosophers. Maimonides’ basic  argument is that a deity who created the world certainly has the ability to change  the nature of every creature in it. Only the conceptually impossible cannot be  performed by God. Maimonides also has some important comments on this  subject in his earlier legal works, most notably in his commentary on Mishnah  Avot 5.6 and in Eight Chapters, 8. In the present context, I confine myself to his  remarks in the Guide. For some other studies of Maimonides’ view of miracles, see  Hannah Kasher, “Biblical Miracles and the Universality of Natural Law: Maimon- ides’ Three Methods of Harmonization,” Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy  8 (1998): 25-52; and Y. Tzvi Langermann, “Maimonides and Miracles: The Growth  of a (Dis)belief,” Jewish History 18 (2004): 147-172. </page> <page sequence="41"> The Prophecy of Moses  355 upon it the existing nature, He put it into these natures that all the  miracles that occurred would be produced in them at the time when  they occurred. According to this opinion, the sign of a prophet  consists in God’s making known to him the time when he must make  his proclamation, and thereupon a certain thing is effected according  to what was put into its nature when first it received its particular  impress. If this statement is as you will see it, it indicates the superi- ority of the man who made it and the fact that he found it extremely  difficult to admit that a nature may change after the Work of the  Beginning, or that another volition may supervene after that nature  has been established in a definite way. For instance, he seems to  consider that it was put into the nature of water to be continuous  and always flow downwards except at the time of the drowning of  the Egyptians; it was the particularity of that water to become  divided. I have drawn your attention to the spirit of that passage and  to the fact that all this serves to avoid having to admit the coming  into being of something new. (Guide 2.29: 345)103 In this manner, Maimonides indicates that even if one accepts the view  that the world is created by showing that this view does not entail  belief in a change in God’s will or wisdom—such a change being  impossible to ascribe to God according to the Aristotelian philosophers  and Maimonides in their wake—there still remains a problem regarding  miracles. At first glance, the miracle necessitates a change in the divine  will, if not also a change in God’s knowledge and wisdom. For this  reason Maimonides praises the sage who tries to show that there is no  change of will after creation, since the miracles were implanted in  nature at the time of creation. Despite his praise, Maimonides does not state explicitly that he  agrees with this view. Moreover, he presents a different view in his own  name immediately prior to passage cited above, in which he argues: I have said that a thing does not change its nature in such a way that  the change is permanent merely in order to be cautious with regard  103 Maimonides bases his comments on Genesis Rabbah 5.4. He opens his discussion  with the remark: “The Sages, may their memory be blessed, have made a very  strange (gharīb) statement about miracles.” On the positive usage of the term gharīb  in Maimonides’ writings, see Avraham Nuriel, Concealed and Revealed in Medieval  Jewish Philosophy (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2000), 158-164 (Heb.). </page> <page sequence="42"> 356 Chapter Nine to the miracles. For although the rod was turned into a serpent, the  water into blood, and the pure and noble hand became without a  natural cause that necessitated this, these and similar things were  not permanent and did not become another nature. But as they, may  their memory be blessed, say: “The world goes its customary way”  [BT ‘Avodah Zarah 54b]. This is my opinion, and this is what ought  to be believed. (ibid.) Maimonides does not enter into a detailed analysis of these two  views, nor does he indicate what the difference is between the Sages’  view and his own, if in fact he regards them as two different views.  It should be noted that the examples of miracles he brings in the  presentation of his own view and in the presentation of that of the  Sages are different. He may have been of the opinion that the Sages’  explanation is not appropriate for those miracles in which an entity is  transformed into a different one, such as the rod that was transformed  into a serpent, for it is difficult to consider them exceptional events  that were implanted in nature. They do not lend themselves to any  naturalistic explanation, and it appears that they can only occur as a  result of an act of volition on the part of an agent who is capable of  bringing about such a transformation. In any case, despite his distinct tendency to defend the natural  order as it is, and to regard it as the primary expression of God’s  wisdom and ability, Maimonides accepts the belief that miracles  reveal God’s ability to act outside the workings of nature and even  counter to it, and that this belief is essential to Judaism. Belief in the  creation of the world is the basis for belief in miracles and that the  Torah is from heaven, as Maimonides argues in Guide 2.25: The belief in eternity the way Aristotle sees it—that is, the belief  according to which the world exists in virtue of necessity, that no  nature changes at all, and that the customary course of events cannot  be modified with regard to anything—destroy the Law in its prin- ciple, necessarily gives the lie to every miracle, and reduces to inanity  all the hopes and threats that the Law has held out. (328-329) Yet if Maimonides’ true view is that the world is without beginning, as  I argued in chapter 3, it is clear that he did not agree with the belief  </page> <page sequence="43"> The Prophecy of Moses  357 that God is the immediate agent of the miracles and immediate author  of the Torah, or that particular miracles were implanted in nature at  the time of creation. The question immediately arises whether amidst  Maimonides’ various comments on miracles one can discern hints to an  esoteric approach that explains their occurrence in a manner that is in  harmony with Aristotelian thought. As we have already seen, Avicenna  developed an approach that posited that the prophet himself was the  agent of miracles. Al-Ghazali presents Avicenna’s approach in his  Incoherence of the Philosophers.104 In the Jewish world prior to Maimon- ides, both Ibn Ezra and Abraham Ibn Daud followed in Avicenna’s  footsteps.105 There is little doubt that Maimonides was acquainted with  some if not all of these sources. In an article on miracles I wrote that perhaps a veiled allusion to  the idea that the prophet is the agent of miracles can be detected in  Guide 1.61, where Maimonides polemicizes against the writers of  amulets in the course of his discussion of the names of God: Do not let occur to your mind the vain imaginings of the writers of  charms or what names you may hear from them or may find in their  stupid books, names that they have invented, which are not indica- tive of any notion whatsoever, but which they call “the names” and  of which they think that they necessitate holiness and purity and  work miracles. All these are stories that it is not seemly for a perfect  man to listen to, much less to believe. None is called “the articulated  name” except the name having four letters that is written but not  read in accordance with the sounds written down. (149)106 I wrote in reference to this passage: It is noteworthy that Maimonides does not negate the view that one  can perform miracles through knowledge of the “articulated Name.”  104 Al-Ghazali, The Incoherence of the Philosophers, trans.

Rather, it indicates notions with respect to  the divine essence. Moses, in Maimonides’ view, possessed the  highest level of knowledge of God, and of how the world is governed  by Him possible for man. On the basis of this knowledge, he may  have been able to produce exceptional events. This conclusion would  explain Maimonides’ position that just as Moses’ apprehension and  prophecy were superior to those of all others, so were his miracles.107  I would like to take this opportunity to substantiate this hypothesis  further. Maimonides continues to explain the meaning of the articulated  Name in the following chapter when discussing the priestly benediction: I believe that the dictum: “The Sages transmit the the name having  four letters once a week to their sons and their pupil [BT Qiddushin  71a],” refers not only to their teaching the mode of pronouncing this  name but also to their making known the notion because of which  this name has been originated without any derivation. Accordingly,  there also would be in this notion a divine secret. (Guide 1.62: 150) That is to say, knowledge of the Name is primarily metaphysical knowl- edge and not the manner in which the letters are articulated. The other  special divine names too, according to Maimonides, indicate metaphys- ical notions regarding the Deity.108 In chapter 63, Maimonides turns to the story of the burning bush  and the significance of the divine names that Moses learned in his  vision. In this context, Maimonides also notes that Moses was the first  prophet who received a prophetic mission to others,109 whereas the  patriarchs received prophetic communications pertaining to their  personal affairs alone. In the same vision, Moses also learned the philo- sophic proofs that he was to teach the Israelite sages in order to  demonstrate that God is the necessary existent, and not the soul of the  107 “Miracles in Medieval Jewish Philosophy,” 114 108 Several times in the chapter Maimonides repeats the view that what was taught  regarding all the special names of God were the notions they indicate and not  simply how they were to be pronounced. Compare to the approach of Nissim of  Marseille, Ma‘aseh Nissim, 404-407. 109 On the nature of prophetic missions in general in the philosophy of Maimonides,  see Prophecy: The History of an Idea in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 252-253. </page> <page sequence="45"> The Prophecy of Moses  359 sphere—the belief that characterized the idolatrous religions of old.  Maimonides continues: [Moses], peace be on him, posed another question saying: once they  have accepted by means of these intellectual demonstrations the  view that there is an existent deity, what shall be my proof that  the existent deity has sent me? Thereupon he was granted the  miracle. (155) Maimonides does not explain here the true nature of the vision that  Moses beheld. When Maimonides deals with the subject of prophecy in  the second part, he treats all prophetic visions as the product of the  imaginative faculty, but he is careful to exclude Moses from the  description of this phenomenon that he brings there. Maimonides,  however, does not deny that other prophets also performed miracles— the opposite is the case110—only that one should regard Moses’ miracles  as superior to all others. The question arises how they succeeded in this  matter. The answer appears to be straightforward: they learned which  miracle was about to take place by means of their prophetic vision,  which resulted from an emanation upon their intellect and their imagi- native faculty. Yet as I attempted to show in my book on prophecy,  one should not interpret Maimonides as maintaining that the emana- tion that reaches the prophet contains specific knowledge that is  directed to him personally. Rather, the emanation strengthens the  faculties of the soul of the prophet, enabling him to arrive at conclu- sions regarding conceptual matters or in the field of divination based on  the knowledge that he previously acquired.111 If this is the case, the  prophet apparently learns of exceptional occurrences or anomalies in  nature that are about to take place, or how to act upon different bodies  to bring about changes in them, pertaining to those matters upon which  he concentrated his thought when the prophetic emanation reached him. Maimonides hints in Guide 3.45 that Moses too received his  prophecy by means of the imaginative faculty in his vision of the  burning bush: “Even in the case of Moses our Master his prophetic  110 See, for example, Guide 2.35. 111 See Prophecy: The History of an Idea in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 243-245. </page> <page sequence="46"> 360 Chapter Nine mission is inaugurated through an angel: And there appeared unto him an  angel of the Lord in the heart of fire (Exodus 3:2)” (576). It appears that  this side remark, which touches only indirectly upon the subject of the  chapter, is a good example of Maimonides’ esoteric writing, in which  “nothing has been mentioned out of its place, save with a view to  explaining some matter in its proper place” (Guide 1.introduction: 15).  There are different possibilities for interpreting the secret Maimonides  wishes to hide, and it is not my intent to deal with them here.112 One  thing is certain. The miracles that Moses saw at the burning bush  were in a vision that was created by his imaginative faculty as a result  of the emanation that reached him from the Active Intellect. This  signifies that the miracles beheld by Moses at the burning bush did not  happen in reality. When they did happen later on, for the transforma- tion of a rod into a serpent subsequently took place publicly in Pharaoh’s  court, they apparently were performed on the basis of knowledge  acquired by Moses during his initial vision. Moses then was the agent  of these miracles as a result of the emanation that descended upon his  intellect and imaginative faculty. It seems to me that the interpretation  of the vision of the burning bush that Nissim explicitly presents in  Ma‘aseh Nissim is in fact the esoteric view of Maimonides. Nissim writes: If you are not pleased with the view that what happened between  God and Moses regarding the two miracles mentioned there occurred  in his internal senses [i.e., the imagination], but you believe that  they occurred in reality—there is no harm in this. Furthermore, if  you find this view harmful [that the miracles did not occur in reality],  I will retract it and say that God showed him and taught him  privately how to bring them about, till he knew how to perform them  before the community of Israel and before Pharaoh. Congruous with  this view is His saying: See all the miracles that I have put into your  hand [Exodus 4:21]—until he knows how to do them as he knows  them in his mind, till he can do them accurately without mishap. For  by demonstration and experience he will fulfill his objective.113 112 Ibid., 297-301. 113 Ma‘aseh Nissim, 202.
