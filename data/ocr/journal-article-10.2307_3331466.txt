<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thoughts on the Teaching of Music THEODORE E. B. WOOD There are a number of signs that music is being taught more widely in the elementary and secondary schools than ever before. Yet this development coincides with a disturbing era in creative art. It is this uneasy confluence of circumstances that inspires my essay, which seeks to present the current situation in serious music, and to suggest ideas for the teacher of music. Aesthetic theory will be used to relate these two concerns. Among Western artistic traditions music is a relative newcomer; it is only about 1,000 years old. Even so, music faces possibly a graver crisis than any of the older arts. Why? Simply because it has apparently exhausted its capacity both for growth within an identifiable tradition and for viable parody, taken in the broadest sense, of that tradition. To put it another way, music is smack up against an electronified wall. On the other side of the wall stand gadget factories and an occasional hall where people gather to listen to silent music. It's pure Dada. In a way, this scene brings music full circle from the fifteenth century; one kind of ritual is substituted for another. But the difference is that the earlier religious and social ritual uses of music deepened humanity, while the contemporary technological use of music tends toward dehumanization through aleatory silence. If it appears that the artists have run amuck, it also seems that aestheticians have been sitting on their hands, perhaps inevitably, since art always precedes THEODORE E. B.

He has taught on both secondary and college levels, and has been a literature specialist for the school division of Addison Wesley Publishing Com- pany. This combined experience encouraged him to start his own company -Educational Consulting Associates. His book, The Word Sublime and Its Context, 1650-1760, will soon be published by Mouton and Co. The field of music education has long been one of his major interests.</page><page sequence="2">94 THEODORE E. B. WOOD analysis. Or maybe it is the nature of the beast; Morris Weitz suggests throughout his writings that there may be no such thing as a general theory of art, but only theories about this work or that. Granted, then, that the present state of music is bewildering, and that teachers must grapple with the problem in any course they give that pretends to completeness, I would ask if aesthetics is truly incapable of providing enlightenment. And immediately I answer, no, especially if aesthetics cannot free itself of its bondage to eighteenth- and nine- teenth-century rationalism, the strongest ties of which are the concepts of value and morality. This it is loath to do, for Western art has gener- ally embraced questions of value and morality. Indeed, aesthetics tradi- tionally sought to demonstrate that the degree and kind of values and morality in an art work accounted primarily for the work's evocation of emotion in the perceiver. Now I am not advocating that aesthetics abandon such considerations, but rather that it recognize the limits of emotion as an aesthetic tool. Quite obviously, man's exterior manifesta- tion of emotion as derived from art perception is far cruder than the mental activity involved in that perception, and he is severely limited in the number of ways he can release psychic charges. Hence, to the ex- tent that classical aesthetics argued a posteriori from observed responses to art back to the anatomy of art, it profoundly circumscribed itself as even a quasiscientific discipline. It required a mind like Nietzsche to see that aesthetics must take new paths: he suggested physiology. A half century was to pass, however, before Nietzsche's challenge was taken up, and then it was by psychology rather than by formal aesthetics. Before discussing the pertinence of psychology to the problems of contemporary music and the teaching of music, however, some speculation about the present and future state of the arts, especially music, is in order. The situation is rather well stated by the following: Unfortunately, while man's creative mind is born anew in every generation, potentially perhaps in every person, even in every new moment of life, his cultural products remain. Moreover, the productive materials themselves are finite, at least as regards the number of original exploitations they permit; whereas human creativity is infinite in its demands. This situation has the makings of disaster .... Hardpressed is the moder artist indeed, but by the exhaustion of art's finite resources!1 I suspect that relatively few people involved in the arts would agree with this. I am, however, one of them. I believe that the moder artist 1Times Literary Supplement (October 12, 1967), 950.</page><page sequence="3">THOUGHTS ON THE TEACHING OF MUSIC 95 is petulant not because of "world conditions," man's nuclear threat to himself, and the like, but rather because his protean nature finds no new artistic forms to take. There is some precedent for the opinion that external political and economic forces have much less effect on the artist than on the man, for assuredly the duality exists. In the first century A.D., for instance, the Greek writer Longinus was able to sur- mount contemporaneous despair over the oppressive effect of the politi- cal and social situation on the artist and his creative function. He pointed out that there is no deterministic connection between the state of a society and art, and exhorted the artists of his time to transcend their condition.2 The modern critic, George Steiner, moreover, in writ- ings like his Language and Silence3 has occupied himself with the interrelationship of cultural norms and pressures on the one hand, and personal morality and response to art on the other. All Steiner has been able to conclude for certain is that the relationship is tenuous and fraught with mystery; a man can indeed murder by day and perform Mozart exquisitely in the evening. It is doubtless less difficult to per- suade the reader of this phenomenon than of the possibility that art has virtually exhausted its resources. Allow me to call a witness: Even the traditionalists contribute to the fiction of a thriving art because their natural sense of self-preservation keeps them from believing in the possibility, or even probability, that traditional art may have exhausted its creative potential - a situation that has never before occurred in the history of mankind.4 Albersheim's statement is close to the mark, particularly with respect to the present state of music. He is one of a small minority that looks for the cause in the proper quarter. And that quarter is form. Yet I want to deal with the objection most often incurred when this whole issue arises. The opposition argues that Western art has experienced several major stylistic breakdowns, only to find new subject matter and forms after the intermediate period of malaise or ennui. There is the Italian Renaissance painting following the devitalization of the work of the Middle Ages, the Romantic Period in English letters after the insipidities of most late Augustan drama and poetry, and Stravinsky's redirection of Western music after the cliches of bombast and giantism of post-romantics like Bruckner, Mahler, and Richard Strauss.

WOOD same token, continues the opposition, Western artists will shortly breach the present impasse and move on to new forms of expression. I would agree only to the extent that the artist will inevitably keep moving. The vital question, however, is in what direction. Albersheim says that: ". .. atonal music . . . prevented the listener from understanding [being] a music without structural order which offered no clues for its cohesion" leading to "electronic music [which] offers no possibility what- ever of a rational structuring of tonal space because noises do not occupy defined places in space."5 Andy Warhol's casual arrangements of soda pop bottles and posters is roughly the same kind of "art" by tinkering. So, the creative impulse drives on ceaselessly, but whither? It is too soon to say, of course, but regardless of that, I think it is very important to maintain respect for the tradition. Leonard B. Meyer is right when he opines that we are now involved in stasis, artistically speaking, according to which the idea of progress is meaningless. He foresees negligible innovation in the arts for some time ahead.6 Doubtless a computer expert will presently prove mathematically that all possible melodies, metaphors, palettes, etc., are used up. Barring this, the evidence for my case is frankly ex post facto; one observes the scene and concludes as he will. In any case, there is no reason for the teacher of music, and of the other arts, to be on the defensive; the idea of progress is also becoming suspect among the philosophers of science! It is time to become more positive. Thomas Munro writes: One may look forward to the use of art and aesthetic experience for more im- portant values, especially in education. But to do this with scientific power and precision, we must first understand the arts more thoroughly as psycho- logical and cultural phenomena.' Without getting bogged down in the problems of this passage - for example, the degree to which aesthetics is or is not a science - it says two arresting things. First, education can be expected to put increasing emphasis on value, as represented by art. Second, it behooves educators to know as much as possible about the psychology underlying art. This does not necessarily involve Freudian literary criticism or humorless searches for archetypal images in painting. Rather, the passage suggests 5 Ibid., p. 291.

Starting in the 1920's a school of psychology has been emerging that at first glance appears to be like Gestalt, with "set theory" for teeth. This school has gone by several names; John Dewey referred to it as "transactions," while Jerome Bruner more recently termed it "directive- state" theory. I will use "transactionist." It promises to open more doors on the mind than Gestalt succeeded in doing, differing from the latter by having a less rigid association theory and by hypothesizing more rigorously on the physiology of thought. Transactionism proposes that the human brain organizes and patterns ideas as wholes rather than stringing the lesser parts of the wholes together in such a way that each part retains its own identity. An analogy might be a kaleidoscope as compared with a domino game. The former forms its patterns from chaos instantaneously, while the latter builds chains by accretion, one at a time. Crude as the analogy is, it expresses quite well how trans- actionism differs from associationism which has been with us in one form or another since David Hartley "invented" it in the early nine- teenth century. The key word of transactionism is "pattern." Transactionism has recently been brought to bear on aesthetics by Morse Peckham.8 As a matter of fact Peckham makes it the basis of what he calls the first valid aesthetic. I am not inclined to embrace the idea of one correct aesthetic, simply because there can be no such thing, but used as a working hypothesis, Peckham's adaptation of transaction- ism sheds considerable light. Here, then, is Peckham's new aesthetic, briefly sketched. There is basically no such thing as immanent form in art. The term form really refers to the expectancy, or "set," of the perceiver. Hence one begins with the perceiver, and proceeds to the art work, defining the latter's characteristics in terms of the perceiver's total response. Moreover, there is no logical or organic basis for any of the arts to have developed along the lines they in fact have. Rather it is the "cultural apex" of any society that creates the values and demands which in turn lead the artist to choose among any number of possible forms his ex- pression could take. The cultural apex is just about what one would expect it to be; few artists are members! The demands of the cultural apex will be observable in the art work's "primary signs" (e.g., in a painting, bright light as a representation of psychological adequacy with respect to the environment) and in the work's "configurational 8 Man's Rage for Chaos (Philadelphia: Chilton, 1965).</page><page sequence="6">98 THEODORE E. B. WOOD signs" (e.g., the cross shape of most church architecture). In these terms, the appearance of a typical New England village church can be predicted from a knowledge of that society: the confident, orthodox milieu leads to the erection of a light-filled interior in the form of a cross. Having received from the cultural apex a given demand, the artist then sets about the task of creating his own style, which is simply a manipulation of materials within the confines of that demand. Some periods (e.g., the Baroque) and artists (e.g., J. S. Bach) sanction and produce art that offers more variables vis-a-vis the "set" (expectancy) of the perceiver; others (e.g., the Enlightenment and the young Mozart) create art of minimal expectancy frustration. Thus the Ro- mantic period, beginning in the late eighteenth century and still with us, is unique, because for the first time in the history of art the artist as a man of his time is able to distinguish between himself as a self and himself as a role. Hence there is no possibility for a single nineteenth- or twentieth-century style; the cultural apex expects, nay demands, that each artist create a unique style to match his unique self. While much in Peckham's theory is questionable, his emphasis on patterning and expectancy is highly interesting, and my use of transac- tionism as a working hypothesis depends on both. Any teacher of music knows that one of his first tasks is preparing the class to hear unfamiliar music with new ears, as it were. If their expectancy is rock and roll, they may have extraordinary trouble with Baroque music, which is diffi- cult enough for most modern listeners under the best of circumstances: There are many listeners . . . upon whom any musical pattern is lost which cannot be contained within a single specious present. For them the most powerfully composed work of a Bach or a Beethoven would remain merely a succession of "tunes" and "passages." But for the "imaginal" listener who can grasp the wonderful interrelatedness of part to part and section to section in a classical concerto or symphony, it must be evident that there is every difference both in felt quality and in emotional power between hearing pleasant sequences of sounds or melodies and recognizing each passage in terms of its aesthetic relevance to the whole pattern of which it is a part. And this difference, I submit, can be explained only in terms of those ideo- motor and ideo-affective dispositions which I have called specific aesthetic beliefs.9 True enough, but the use of a term like "aesthetic beliefs" tends to bring the matter to a close theoretically. Perhaps our transactionist hypothesis allows us to say more. Any random group, and many a music 9Henry David Aiken, "The Aesthetic Relevance of Belief," in Aesthetic Inquiry, op. cit., p. 152.</page><page sequence="7">THOUGHTS ON THE TEACHING OF MUSIC 99 appreciation class is random, shows a spectrum of overall ability to pat- tern in the transactionist sense. This is so whether we are speaking of ability to play chess, handle higher mathematics, or comprehend com- plex serious music. No one knows exactly why this should be so, but it is. The spectrum for skill in musical assimilation apparently shows a typical (virtually by definition) bunching around the middle of the scale. A teacher who plays Debussy's The Afternoon of a Faun to a high school class should be prepared for a perfunctory response from most of its members, at least on first hearing and if they are honest. The reason is, I suspect, that Faun though only about seven minutes long is thematically amorphous and vague for the average listener; there is little to "grab hold of." Like the Mallarme poem that inspired it, Faun is "about" nothing but itself. Its wonder is the incredibly subtle and rich use of the musical materials Debussy allows himself. Apparently its musicality is so intense and its extra-artistic content so sparse, despite its being classified as "program music," that its essence escapes almost any listener on a first hearing, and still the majority of listeners after repeated hearings. Thus Faun could easily be a dis- couraging entre for a class into impressionistic music. At this point a contrast comes to mind which is too curious to pass by. For many years after his death in 1911 Gustav Mahler was an in- frequent name on American concert programs. His music was con- sidered terribly formidable and, in many cases, lengthy beyond the power of an audience to endure. The last decade has exploded such ideas, but the interesting question remains, why are the problematical symphonies of Mahler so popular with contemporary audiences? Allow- ing for the undoubted appeal to our time of his withdrawn, somewhat neurotic temperament, I suspect the real reason is the structure of the works themselves. For Mahler repeats his themes in or near their original forms often enough that the average listener, that is, the listener with ordinary physiological powers of assimilating aural patterns, can follow the composition with "understanding" at first hearing. By the end of a given movement, the main themes are indeed old friends. Strange to think there was a time when Mahler was considered more inaccessible than Debussy! The teacher, in an attempt to smooth the way to understanding good music, can err in the other direction. Transactionism helps to illumine this paradox also. As Albersheim states: Most people, including those who deal professionally with the theory, aes- thetics, and psychology of music, do not realize the extent to which the intelli-</page><page sequence="8">100 THEODORE E. B. WOOD gent listener is actively involved in turning into a meaningful event the sounds heard in a musical performance.10 I think it is necessary for what follows to adopt a firm stand in the very beginning on what I take Albersheim to mean by an "intelligent listener." I am certain he does not mean a person who has been dragged to concerts for thirty years, and who therefore has had perforce a prolonged exposure to music. Neither does he intend exclusively the formally educated listener, up to and including the holder of an ad- vanced degree in musicology or performing accomplishment. I believe Albersheim is talking about the statistically rare person who understands music because he has what for lack of a better word we call an intuitive grasp of the abstract language of music. As it turns out, this person may be henpecked into concert-going or may hold a degree in music, but if so the connection is coincidental, not causal. That this listener is a member of a small minority of the population at large is hardly strange; how many devotees of atomic physics or poetry would one expect to find in his neighborhood? There are many more do-it-yourself me- chanics and reciters of limericks. In other words, what the teacher has on his hands is the matter of hierarchy in the classroom. The concept of hierarchy is a relatively unpopular one in a democratic society, and perhaps also in a democratic educational system, but I am afraid that to deny hierarchy in human aptitude for playing and listening to music would be cant, and even worse, could alienate the very students who need good music most. The general solution, of course, is individualiza- tion of training in music appreciation, though specific recommendations must be the subject of a different paper than this. Let me take the same idea a step farther. When Albersheim refers to the listener actively turning sounds into a meaningful event, he makes two most important, if implicit, points. First, listening can be creative just as surely as composing and performing are creative, and all three involve rather different kinds, phases, or combinations of creative aural activity. The limited knowledge we have of the relationships between neural activity in the brain and human behavior prevents my pursuing this point, but I will assume it is granted that listening can indeed be creative. The second point is that the great composers of the Western musical tradition wrote for the intelligent listener, or even for them- selves, as opposed to the uneducated audience. While it is true that much, perhaps most "good" music of the sixteenth through eighteenth cen- turies was by commission first and ego-release only second, nevertheless 10 Albersheim, p. 289.</page><page sequence="9">THOUGHTS ON THE TEACHING OF MUSIC 101 audiences for this music were generally smaller, and probably quite musically intelligent in terms of contemporaneous styles and purposes. With the coming of the Romantic era, as we know, the mass audience made its first appearance in the history of Western music. Although music as I have said paralleled her sister arts in failing to develop a single nineteenth-century grand style, that fact seemed of doubtful importance just so long as music continued to communicate to a certain number of "intelligent" listeners. And it seems to me that this com- munication was possible because the leading composers kept their ex- pressions, however idiosyncratic, within certain limits of physiology, if you will. I will return to physiology presently. A frustration common to music teachers is the fact that nearly all of their students are enthusiastic about so-called popular music, but are something less than ecstatic over the "longhair" variety. How can this be, when Brahms is patently better than be-bop? Well, even if the term "better" applies to the situation it implies little persuasion as far as students are concerned. They know what is good and what is not! Might this have something to do with it: The differentia between art music and primitive music lies in speed of tendency gratification. The primitive seeks almost immediate gratification for his tendencies whether these be biological or musical. Nor can he tolerate uncertainty." Yes, I think so without a doubt. But if this were all there is to it, edu- cation of the proper kind and duration would help the vast majority of students to improve their musical taste dramatically. After all, what is education if not self-discipline and training in the deferment of gratifi- cation. I hold, however, that such hopes for education are illusory: in terms of innate musical ability all races and cultures are primitive. We should not be fooled by the fact that there is no African Mozart; there is no African Einstein or Henry Ford either. I will leave this complex problem to the anthropologists, and wish them luck, but the point is that the music of the Congo, for example, is what it is because that culture relies on music for ritual and communication primarily. As such, primitive music is extremely effective, but does not inform us of the musical ability of a given individual. Mozarts there may have been, but the primitive milieu kept them mute. On the other hand, because so many of the world's primitive peoples sing spontaneously is no proof that they are more musical than Caucasians who do not. The truly 1 Leonard B. Meyer, "Some Remarks on Value and Greatness in Music," in Aesthetic Inquiry, op. cit., p. 267.</page><page sequence="10">102 THEODORE E. B. WOOD significant factor, as Meyer suggests, is the lack of suspense in primitive music, and in that way it is exactly like most Western popular music. Does it not make sense that primitives employ such music, and the "civilized" enjoy it because it is at once assimilable and enjoyable - in a word, gratifying? Yet, why gratifying? Possibly because certain neurons in the brain undergo a physical and/or chemical change during the process of completed patterning activity. The change, ap- parently, causes intense satisfaction to both the neurons and by exten- sion to the individual involved. Sometimes the satisfaction attains to the level of ecstasy (noted at primitive rituals and in Caucasian concert halls). As to why one person patterns football plays efficiently while another does better with fugues we will just have to be patient. But pedagogically speaking, it should be established that the modest ability of most students to pattern musically does not mean that serious music is reserved for the few. Such an idea is wrong for several reasons. I will mention only two. First, as mentioned above, students can fall anywhere on the spectrum of musical ability; who can say exactly where? Hence they should be given music that stretches rather than confines them. Second, serious music varies enormously with respect to the patterning challenge posed. Consider the distance on the road to complexity one travels when he leaves the early music of Mozart for the "Grosse Fugue" of Beethoven, or the symphonies of Tchaikowsky for the tone poems of Schoenberg. There is no need, then, to espouse condescension in the music curriculum. Much can be done to bring great music and young people into proximity. By way of conclusion, I would like to offer an interpretation of a scene from Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungs. This will illus- trate my point that until the mid-twentieth-century, composers suc- ceeded in communicating because they kept their art within the reach of human physiology. I also hope to suggest why the latest experimental music fails to communicate. Wagner intended his Ring operas as a grand philosophical statement. The four music dramas of the Ring convey the world and human existence as perpetually evanescent. Values constantly shift, power is held first by one party and then by another. Man, for Wagner's gods are unashamedly anthropomorphic, lives by illusion, and more often than not dies in it. A late Romantic document, the Ring quite amaz- ingly still succeeds as a symbolic work. And this in spite of the ubiqui- tous bombast in the stage action. Assuredly as straight "theatre" the Ring is quite hopeless. What saves it then? The magnificent</page><page sequence="11">THOUGHTS ON THE TEACHING OF MUSIC 103 music of course. Careful listening will reveal that Wagner reserves many of his finest touches for the moments when symbolic action rather than dramatic action dominates. Perhaps most vivid among these moments is the point in the last act of Das Rheingold when the mists and fogs dissipate, and the newly created Valhalla appears, glittering, for the first time. This unveiling obviously has great significance for Wagner, the protean architect. If it were not for the symbolic charge attached to the origins, use, and destiny of Valhalla, one would be sur- prised at the prominence of the music accompanying the gods' initial glimpse of their new home. I cannot go into the symbolism of the scene here because the issue at hand is Wagner's musical rendering of that symbolism. In a manner of speaking the music successfully negotiates the knife-edge separating the aesthetic chasms of sentimentality and rodomontade. It is more than luck that sees Wagner through, or maybe I should say across. Specifically, Wagner employs one of the simplest musical ideas imaginable - the inverted triad, first in the major, then in the minor mode. The triad is repeated by various combinations in the brass. Introducing and sustaining the triad is a tremolo in the upper strings. My response, so far as I can verbalize it, is as follows: the note inter- vals of the triad, especially as rendered by the coarse and powerful timbres of the brass, sound, even feel, like a thrust through space of cosmic proportions. There is majesty, puissance, and above all, a sense of enormous scale. The shimmering string sound somehow supports this sense, as well as depicting the idea of illusion. Even if one comes to verbalize all this long after his first hearing of the passage, he feels it was in the music all the time. I am arguing that Wagner succeeds with his tone picture because he never violates either our sense of decorum or our physiological limits. I am arguing that the direct effect on the brain from this music is a sensation of vastness, not that one later re- creates the impression intellectually as I by necessity have just done here. The question is whether a music class should be subjected to analyses like the above before they hear the music, whether afterwards, or not at all. Maybe a mere hint by the teacher somewhere along the way is sufficient. Though no student can be forced into feeling all of this, most music teachers feel a professional obligation and personal need to measure student response. How many members of the class begin to achieve valid and relevant aesthetic experiences from listening to great music? And how are such experiences recognized by the teacher</page><page sequence="12">104 THEODORE E. B. WOOD as a guide to his present and future methods and goals? Honesty com- pels me to admit that I am not sure. As noted above, the human being's ways of manifesting aesthetic emotion are much more limited and crude than the physiological processes of perception called into play. A stu- dent's "Wow!" here or there tells the teacher little about the validity of the aesthetic experience; the student may have been moved primarily by nostalgia or by the high fidelity of the music's reproduction in the classroom. Perhaps the music teacher must forego the pleasure and reassurance of reliable signs of student achievement. He may have to settle instead for less precise evidence, like a student's request for a certain selection for classroom listening, student attendance at outside concerts, or the desire expressed to take up the study of a musical instrument. I suspect, in short, that the music teacher must do the best he can, and learn to live with professional uncertainty. The contemporary scene offers another sort of problem for the teacher, as well as a remarkable transition in musical purposes and methods. The above-quoted passage on electronic music by Albersheim is particularly relevant to what I have just remarked about Wagner's power to invoke the scale and mystery of the cosmos through idiosyn- cratic use of traditional musical figures. I have heard several avant- garde compositions that try also to portray the firmament. They suc- ceed, but in a limited and coldblooded way, and this is the point. They function as signs rather than as symbols. They use noise and silence rather than notes in rationally meaningful patterns. Essentially such pieces are background music for looking through telescopes. Since this music is irrational, that is, since it cannot be patterned by the human mind, it cannot say very much about itself. The great art of the past has always said a great deal about itself. If the avant-garde composer rebuts that his "music" is an honest representation of contemporary psychic confusion, I would answer with Rosenberg that Humanity is almost defined by its compulsion to make . . . patterns.... But the psyche knows no order, it is fluid, and rebels against containment.12 Here at last is a possible resolution to the age-old debate as to whether art precedes life, follows life, or has any necessary relationship to life at all; human life, at any rate, includes both order and chaos, and art is a variety of order, a patterning of material which resists being wrenched from chaos. I think it follows, then, that so-called psychic art as a reproduction of chaos is by definition antithetical to art and to that which is most humane in man. 12 Marvin Rosenberg, "A Metaphor for Dramatic Form," ibid., p. 80.</page><page sequence="13">THOUGHTS ON THE TEACHING OF MUSIC 105 I see no reason for the teacher of music to pretend that avant- garde compositions do not exist, however, any more than I see why he should lionize them. Students, all of us in fact, should listen atten- tively to the strange sounds coming from studio and laboratory. Each person must decide for himself whether he is hearing music or noise. If the teacher does his job well, he will inspire an occasional student to become truly involved in one or more of the problems I have touched on.</page></plain_text>
