Jones I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 130-137 Catullus' libellus, the Mixing of Genres, and the Evidence of Carm. 1, 50, and 46 In a detailed study of a sample of the poems, Jocelyn (1999) argued that, whatever its status as a group, Catullus makes distinctions in metrical practice, in vocabu lary, and in syntax within Carm. 1-61, which correspond to the metrical catego ries, iambic, hendecasyllabic, and lyric, and that these three generic strains differed in both generic antecedents and reader-expectations. In the non-elegiac short poems at least two and possibly three kinds of language "were perceptible to a first-century BC reader or hearer" (Jocelyn 1999, 336). In an examination of the lyric poems and the eleven hendecasyllables (Carm. 10, 12, 16, 21, 28, 32, 33, 35, 49, 50, 53) and three iambic poems (Carm. 29, 31, 52) on either side of them, Jocelyn found a range of features alien to everyday language in all three categories, but massed "strikingly and significantly" (1999, 342) in the lyrics, and more present in the iambics than the hendecasyllables. The lyrics tend to a greater formality and dignity and a more restricted variety than the other categories (Jocelyn 1999, 343). We do not know how the libellus Catullus dedicated to Nepos (Carm. 1) relates to the extant corpus, but Carm. 50 draws attention to the idea of sets of poems in varied metres. Other collections and corpora of epigrams show elements of poly metricality in various degrees like that in Carm. \-6\,l) but if Catullus included poems in lyric metres too he would have been doing something quite exceptional.2) 1} AP 13 contains iambics, hendecasyllables, and various unusual combinations; Theocri tus' epigrams contain iambics (including scazons), hendecasyllables, and elegiacs, and other metres; the (Augustan) Priapea chiefly comprises hendecasyllables and elegiacs, but also contains iambics (usually in the form of scazons) and?the metre of Catullus Carm. 17?a Priapean (86); the Catalepton contains elegiacs, iambics (including scazons and epodic iam bics?trimeters alternating with dimeters). Martial and Statius (in the Silvae), both indebted to Catullus in various ways, each show polymetricality, in Martial's Epigrams involving hendecasyllables, iambics, and elegiacs, and in Statius' Silvae involving hexame ters, hendecasyllables, and lyric metres. 2) While those Catullan poems generally considered to be in lyric metres {Carm. 11, 17, 30, 34, 51, and 61) differ in the strengths of their lyric affiliations, they include Carm. 34 and 61 in glyconic and pherecretean stanzas which go back to Anacreon (357 Page) and have typical lyric themes, and Carm. 11 and 51 in Sapphics, the metre named after one of the canonic lyric poets, the poet, furthermore, whose geographical provenance provided the name for the central female figure of Catullus' body of short poetry, Lesbia. Indeed the name figures in a partial translation by Catullus of a poem (also in Sapphics) by Sappho herself. ?

If a Catul lan libellus contained lyric poems, the same thing would be happening at macro and micro-levels, for there is an element of stylistic inconcinnity which is always ready to break out anywhere in the non-elegiac short poems. Sometimes there is a flurry of conspicuous elevation in an otherwise base poem (Carm. 44), sometimes the levels fluctuate (Carm. 3), sometimes there is some sort of prolonged elevation preparing for a dramatic reversal (Carm. 2, 11), sometimes the level tends to the high but is punctured momentarily (Carm. 4). Carm. 46 does not exhibit that kind of internal variation, but is striking in another way, and one which shows that Jocelyn's position needs some adjustment. Carm. 46 is a poem in hendecasyllables, which?contrary to the normal generic aspirations of the hendecasyllable?maintains an unbroken level of stylistic ele vation. In the putative libellus in which lower and elevated genres lie side by side, a poem apparently in a lower genre, but using the stylistic register of elevated ones, contributes in an important way to the generic confusion and mixing of the whole. iam ver egelidos refert tepores, iam caeli furor aequinoctialis iucundis Zephyri silescit aureis. linquantur Phrygii, Catulle, campi Nicaeaeque ager ?ber aestuosae. 5 ad claras Asiae volemus urbes. iam mens praetrepidans avet vagari, iam laeti studio pedes vigescunt. o dulces comitum v?lete coetus, longe quos simul a domo profectos 10 diversae varie viae reportant.

Already the mind excited in advance wants to rush, already feet happy with enthusiasm quicken. O sweet throngs of comrades, farewell, afar whom set out from home together different roads variously bring back.' In the features distinguishing the three strands of short poetry in the polymetric group there are variations and irregularities, so that one feature?especially in a short poem?may be comparatively unindicative. However, the cumulative pic ture of Carm. 46 is that in many of the areas in which the lyrics tend to be</page><page sequence="3">132 Miscellanea IF Jones I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 130-137 differentiated from the hendecasyllables and iambics this poem occupies a neutral position, but in sentence structure, word-order, vocabulary, and figurative lan guage there are strong pointers to a stylistic register much more in line with the lyrics than the other hendecasyllables. The flavour given by these features probably also means that the neutrality mentioned a moment ago is not, in prac tice, neutral. Various phonetic features tend to dissociate the lyric poems from the hendeca syllables and iambics. Firstly, alliteration is favoured in the lyrics. There are sub stantial variations, and some hendecasyllables have more alliteration than some lyrics (Jocelyn 1999, 349), but even so its presence here can be noted. In both Catulle, campi (4) and varie viae (11) the alliteration-bearing words are gram matically disjunct from each other, but in the latter case there is reinforcement from the immediately preceding diversae, and before that in (avet) vagari (7), viges cunt (8), and v?lete (9). This does not make the poem elevated, but does contrib ute to other distinguishing features. Jocelyn sees no alliteration of significance in Carm. 10, and there is none in the thematically related Carm. 9. There is evidence in the lyrics of pronunciations distinct from those of everyday speech (Jocelyn 1999, 351). This is a phenomenon which is not absent from the hendecasyllable (Jocelyn 1999, 362), but on the other hand we do find in those poems evidence for colloquial pronunciations not present in the lyrics. There is nothing distinctive in this area in Carm. 46, and given its brevity it would be easy to exaggerate the importance of the absence of colloquial pronunciations. It should, however, be registered. Homoeoteleuton of long vowels and diphthongs in juxtaposed grammatically related words is not a feature of the lyrics, but is found in the hendecasyllables. It does not, however, occur in Carm. 46. Elision is rare in the epicizing hexameters of Carm. 64. Figures for elision in hexameters are complex, but Lucilius is very free indeed, and Lucretius is freer than Catullus in Carm. 64. In his Eclogues Virgil is even more restrained than Catullus, but much freer in the Georgics and Aeneid. I would argue3) that a high rate of elision connotes a manly quality, whereas a low rate suggests a high level of aestheticism. Catullus is not as hostile to elision in any of the short poems as he is in Carm. 64, but he is less receptive to it than ordinary language as reflected in Plautus. The hendecasyllables are slightly freer with elision than the lyrics. There is only one case of elision in Carm. 46. The lyric poems also tend to be distinctive in morphology and syntax. Infor malities admitted in the other poems are not admitted in the lyrics. One cannot accredit too much weight to the absence in itself of any such informalities in I mean to write on this elsewhere.</page><page sequence="4">Miscellanea I F. Jones I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 130-137 133 Carm. 46, but it does add to the cumulative neutrality of the picture so far. In this respect we may attach little weight to the plural form of tepores in Carm. 46. The use of the plural connotes 'warm days' or warm weather' (cf. Cic. Att. 10.18.1; Livy 2.5.3; 5.6.4) and is not, therefore, a case of the poetic plural for singular. Likewise little weight can attach to the spelling of aureis (3); this old spelling may be what Catullus always wrote. In the matter, however, of sentence structure and word order, we find clear and positive indications that Carm. 46 aligns itself with the lyric poems. It is, first of all, a feature of the more elevated style that nouns should not be unaccompanied by epithets. In this respect the contrast between Carm. 11 and Carm. 10 is striking (Jocelyn 1999, 365). There are eighteen nouns in Carm. 46, of which the minor ity (seven) lack an attribute. More importantly still, it is a feature of the high style that nouns and their epithets should be separated from each other (hyperbaton).4) Thus we have in the first line egelidos refert tepores. This disjunction occurs in every line except 7 and 10; in nine lines, that is, out of eleven (only two nouns are jux taposed with their epithets, ager in line 5, and mens in line 7). Furthermore, in the majority of cases (seven out of nine) the epithet comes before the noun (cf. Jocelyn 1999, 355). Finally, in line 5 the separated noun and epithet enfold a second noun-epithet pair in a way resembling the artful 'Golden line' arrangement favoured as a stylism in the hexameters of Carm. 64. Carm. 46 is indelibly stamped all the way through with a lofty stylistic aspiration.5) Much of the vocabulary present in Carm. 46 is neutral as regards style. The words, by and large, are acceptable in polite prose and verse without particular restrictions. On the other hand, the poem is low on enclitics and pronouns (cf. Jocelyn 1999, 358, 366), and this falls in with the stylistic aspiration of the separation of nouns and their epithets. In addition to this, certain words stand out in one way or another, namely ver, aequinoctialis, Zephyrii, silescit, Phrygii, prae trepidans, vagari, vigescunt, varie, and reportant. Ver is not in itself a poetic word, but in the context of the opening line of the poem it cannot but bring to the reader's mind the tradition in Greek lyric poetry of the spring song.6) 4) Cf. Pearce 1966, 140-71, 298-320; Adams 1971, 1-16. 5) Other features of sentence structure and word-order contribute: the sentences are not long (it is only a short poem), but they are orderly (contrast the quasi-conversational incon sequentiality of parts of Carm. 10). Enjambment is rather a feature of the iambics and hendecasyllables than of the lyrics, but it is inconspicuous here. The delay of quos in line 10 is probably also an elevated touch (cf. Jocelyn 1999, 366-7). 6) There is a cluster of spring-epigrams at the beginning of AP 10, but these all have a nau tical colouring present in Hor. Carm. 1.4, but absent here.</page><page sequence="5">134 Miscellanea IF Jones I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 130-137 Aequinoctialis seems to be a quite pedestrian word.7) On the other hand, the Greek Zephyri8) is distinctly poetical in register and sound. The proximity enhances the literary artificiality Silescit may perhaps have a poetical flavour (it is found in Terence and later in Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Tristia), but it is a rare word (not in Cicero) and can probably be seen as at least adding choiceness. Phrygii is not a poetical word as such, but it is welcome in high verse and in combination with campi (itself acceptable in polite prose and verse) strongly sug gests the 'Trojan plains' (as at Carm. 64.344; cf. Phrygium nemus at Carm. 63.2), and provides a highly poeticised background for the travels in Carm. 46. Praetrepidans is striking. It may have been a coinage of Catullus and is virtually unused subsequently. Praetrepidus is used by Persius (2.52) and Suetonius (Tib. 63; Nero 41), which tells us little about praetrepidans. Prae- compounds (with prae meaning 'very') tend to be post-Augustan and belong to polite literature (e.g. praecalidus, praecalvus, praedives, praedulcis, praeferox, praerapidus, etc). Most are rare (praecupidus, praelargus, praelucidus, praemollis, praetenuis). Prae- compounds (with.prae- meaning 'before/in advance/in front'), are even more restricted. Prae caveo and praecipito somewhat resemble praetrepidans, but all the evidence suggests that a coinage?or anything like one?involving prae- does not belong in the common register. Rather it has a modernising and literary artificiality (commenta tors cite praegestit at Carm. 64.145). Vagari belongs largely to polite prose and verse, but it is noticeable that the adjectival form vagus is rather favoured in Catullus' larger and more elevated works (see Fordyce at Carm. 64.271). Vigescunt is something of a rarity (see Lucr. 1.674, 757; also in Cicero and Tacitus (Ann. 14.19)), and?like silescit?may add choiceness. Diversae (with inanimate subjects) and varie, on the other hand are rather pedestrian. The vocabulary of the poem, then, does virtually nothing to conflict with the elevation implied by the word-order, and some of it positively raises the poetic level in one way or another. There is evidence, too, in various examples of figured language in the poem. Firstly, there is the matter of word repetition. There is anaphora on iam twice (Carm. 1-2; 7-8). As Jocelyn (1999, 350) observes, the figure appears in all the lyric poems, in some a number of times, and is absent in many of the hendecasyllables. "Where it does appear in this genre it tends to be of the unre 7) Var. L. 9.24; Sen. Nat. 3.28; Plin. Nat. 2.97, 99; Col. 1.6.2. So too the noun {aequinoc tium): Cic. Att. 12.28.3; Caes. Gal. 4.36; Var. L. 6.8; Livy 31.47; Plin. Nat. 2.97, 99. 8) Latin Favonius; Zephyri is in Horace's Odes and Epistles, Virgils' Georgics and Aeneid, and Ovid's Metamorphoses.</page><page sequence="6">Miscellanea I F. fones / Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 130-137 135 markable character o? neque... nee (10.9-10; 21)." The double appearance in this poem is striking, especially since it contributes to the sense of overall structuring of the poem. Metaphor and personification are related phenomena and occur naturally in ordinary speech. However, the more diversified and formalised forms characterise literary aspiration. It is a striking feature of, for example, Aeschylus and Pindar in Greek, and Pindar's exuberance is imitated programmatically by Horace (Odes 4.2.1 ff.).9) Personification is, of course, a major feature in a number of non-lyric and non-elegiac short poems. There is the sparrow as a divinity in Carm. 2 (hen decasyllables), the bed as a hung-over ham orator in Carm. 6 (hendecasyllables), the boat as garrulous and self-aggrandising retired slave in Carm. 4 (iambics), Sirmio as a loyal slave in Carm. 31 (scazons), and the farm as a nurturing god in Carm. 44 (scazons). However, in all these cases the figure is a whimsical or comic fancy making up a large part of the poem. In Carm. 46, by contrast, the personifications are part of the linguistic texture of the poem, and cumulatively draw attention to its literariness rather than to a single comic idea. The metaphoric/ personifying strain in the poem is not on a uniform level throughout the poem. Some instances are perhaps very slight indeed and given audience subjectivity it may impossible to assert that all instances contribute something. Nonetheless, it is important to list these instances as well. In the first line the idea of spring 'bringing back' warmth puts the inanimate ver in the role of subject of a verb. There is here an element of personification. If this is slight?perhaps even imperceptible?the 'madness' of the sky (caeli furor) in the next line and grammatically parallel is less so. In the next line, iucundis aureis attributes a characteristically human attribute to the breezes, and this takes sup port from and gives it to the latent anthropomorphism of Zephyrus as the West wind. There may also be some dormant or not quite dormant metaphorical value in 'sweltering' Nicaea (Nicaeae aestuosae). The representation of eager and hurried movement as flying in volemus (6) is found in polite prose and verse (including Verg. A. 5.819, but also PL Pers. 2.2.17). There is?in a sense?a sort of literalism about the livening of the feet (pedes vigescunt, 8), but the phrase is figured, whether we see it as pars pro toto (the important thing is that Catullus is feeling quickened, rather than his feet as such) or as a slight personification of his feet (which focalise Catullus' emotions). Finally, there is viae reportant. Reportant is acceptable in polite prose and verse, but it is rare with an inanimate subject, and thus a degree of personification is perhaps perceptible. None of these instances is very striking, but it remains that there is in this poem a persistent layer of language verging on the metaphorical. Together with the elegant organisation of the whole, the double anaphora on iam, the persistently 9) See West 1967 in general and 87 ff. on Odes 1.2.</page><page sequence="7">136 Miscellanea I F. Jones I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 130-137 artificial distribution of nouns and epithets, the presence of spring as a mover of new life or activity, and the presence of Zephyrus and the Phrygii campi, we have a poem which is marked out as aspiring to a lyric level rather than allowing itself to blend in with the overall character of the hendecasyllables.10) In conclusion then, Carm. 50 suggests that metrical variety would have been important in a Catullan libellus. Hendecasyllables and iambics are an unproblem atic mixture with precedent, but elegiacs are a strong possibility as well (even the possibility of Catullan libelli including hexameter poems like Carm. 62 cannot be excluded), and the handful of lyric poems also have a claim. The constantly chang ing levels of stylistic variegation visible in the non-elegiac short poems suggests that lyric tones would not be out of place in such a collection. But the inclusion of lyric poems and the diffusion of (not always parodie) lyric characteristics through the libellus?and especially a concentration as found in Carm. 46, virtu ally a lyric in hendecasyllables?would have produced a disturbing mixture for the reader, in which both the utterly trivial and the deeply emotional seem sometimes comic and sometimes epiphanic. This anarchically inconstant lyricization of Lucil ian experience contains a radical ideology in the late republic.n) In his libellus or libelli Catullus created a new genre, a polygeneric one (whose diverse legacy? 'love poetry', epigram, and Statius' Silvae all claim him?gives a corollary of how anarchic it was) in which the duties of the Roman?civic, military, and provincial responsibilities?barely figure. Instead, we have a world in which Catullus and his friends and enemies live and move, have colds, jealousies, and labile relationships, a world too in which sexual organs and digestive tracts function in various ways, as Catullus' generic lenses perform their elaborate fan-dance. It is this, at least as much as the roles masculinity,12) Lesbia, and \ove-as-foedus play in them, that makes the short poems of Catullus revolutionary.
