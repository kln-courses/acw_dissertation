<plain_text><page sequence="1">Images of 'the Good Life' in the Mongolian Altai (Bronze-Early Iron Ages) Esther Jacobson-Tepfer Eugene Rock art in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia is almost entirely petroglyphic rather than pictographic. By that we mean it has been pecked, scratched, or engraved into the surface of bedrock or boulders rather than being painted. Mountainous Bayan Ölgiy aimag, located in western-most Mongolia, includes a remarkable group of rock art complexes. Of these, the complexes of Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor and the Upper Tsagaan Gol are two of the largest and finest such concentrations in North Asia. Their names are taken from the rivers along which they extend, and, like the best rock art sites throughout the Altai mountain region, their location is at least partly related to the presence of hard, glacier-polished and scraped bedrock. These two complexes, together with a number of other smaller but highly significant concentrations,1 include hundreds of thousands of images dating back 12,000 to 14,000 years BP to the late Paleolithic period and continuing down through the Turkic period (c. 1200 - 1300 years BCE). As such, this pictorial material constitutes an extraordinary visual archive for the study of Mongolia's prehistory and early history. It allows us to reconstruct the manner in which humans represented themselves and reflected dominant social values over that long period of time. More vividly even than burials or ritual sites, this material reveals how Bronze Age herders understood the nature of a 'good life,' a life of well-being. For all the wealth of information embedded in rock art imagery, cultural historians have been slow to make use of this material - and for several good reasons. Until fairly recently, North Asian rock art was known only through poorly published and poorly circulated materials, most in non-English languages. It is also likely that many scholars are far less comfortable with the challenge of 'reading' visual imagery than they are with the reading of written texts. Related to and even underlying this is the problem of dating rock art; and it is</page><page sequence="2">88 Mongolian Studies XXIX (2007) undeniable that without dates, rock art is difficult to use as an historical resource. Indeed, despite a number of promising techniques, petroglyphic imagery (in contrast to pictographs) is still resistant to direct dating. Nonetheless, there are a number of ways to constrain the dating of an image or composition. Any one of these considerations alone is an inadequate measure of chronology, but taken together and applied to a broad array of imagery, they make it possible to distinguish periods with considerable confidence. Since the discussion that follows depends on being able to distinguish pre-Bronze Age (c. 12,000-4,000 yrs BP), Bronze Age (2nd millennium BCE), Late Bronze Age (late 2 -early first millennia BCE), Early Iron Age (1st millennium BCE after c. 600), and Turkic period imagery (c. 6th - early 8th c. CE), it is necessary to review these considerations, however briefly. Petroglyphic imagery has been pecked into a rock surface with stone or metal instruments and with direct or indirect blows. Imagery of animals that disappeared by the end of the Pleistocene - rhinoceros (fig. 1) or mammoths being the most obvious examples2 - are almost always executed with rough, broad contour lines distinguished by the crude pitting indicative of the use of direct blows with a heavy stone. Images of these animals are unusual, but enough have been found within the Mongolian Altai to serve as a benchmark for conception, technique, and chronology. These images and others of aurochs (wild cattle), elk (fig. 2), horses, and even ostriches, rendered in a similar manner, indicate that during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods images took the form of large animals viewed in profile, static and monumental in their simplified articulation and executed with coarse, heavy contour lines. Animals from this early period are never represented within any psychologically charged grouping. The only anthropomorphic images that may belong to this period are simple figures in profile, often brandishing a club or heavy stick (see fig. 2). Rock art of succeeding periods indicates gradual changes in technique as visual conceptions changed. Throughout the pre-Bronze Age, imagery continued to be executed with heavy stones and direct blows, but one begins to find occasional figures of male hunters brandishing long bows or large clubs. Frontal and often ithyphallic, these figures suggest a kind of 'hero-hunter' - an ancient mergen (fig. 3). By the time we come well into the Bronze Age, images are distinguished by a more frequent use of silhouette than contour, by pecked marks that are even and controlled as if the artist had now learned the advantages of an indirect technique whereby a large stone</page><page sequence="3">Jacobson-Tepfer 89 would be used to pound a finer-tipped stone or metal point. During the Bronze Age we also begin to see the frequent use of fine lines etched deeply into the rock surface. This technique, of course, betrays the use of a hard metal instrument - bronze or even meteoritic iron. Perhaps the finest, densest pecking belongs to the late Bronze Age. In this imagery, also, the highly controlled pecking barely breaks through the hardened rock case (fig. 4). The pecked areas remain shallow, concentrated, and cleanly edged. In the succeeding centuries, down through the Turkic period, rock artists continued to exploit these advanced techniques of image making. Another way to assess the dating of imagery is through the observation of the comparative darkening, or patina, of the pecked surface. 'Comparative' is the key word, since 'dark' does not necessarily mean 'old.' When would-be artists peck into the hardened rind of typical high mountain sandstone within the Altai range,3 the percussive blows crush the underlying crystals, creating a mark that remains white even after the rock dust has been brushed away. However, the rock's specific mineral composition, the pitch of the surface, surface orientation and the proximity of vegetation to that surface all effect the speed with which imagery will darken back down to the coloration of either the stone matrix or the hardened rind.4 For this reason, assessment of patina as an indicator of age must be embedded within a comparative view of other surfaces in the same immediate area and with the same orientation and mineral composition. In general, and within the Mongolian Altai, imagery from the Paleolithic period has unmistakably darkened down to the coloration of the surrounding hardened rind. Bronze Age imagery is characterized by lighter hues, although the pecked areas may still be a deep tan against the mahogany color of the surrounding rock surface. In imagery that by style and manner of execution can be dated to the late Bronze Age, one frequently finds a distinctive gradation of the patina, from tan to a greenish-white hue that can be lacquer-like in its texture. Some images are so mottled that we seem to be observing the decisive deepening of hue from cream-colored to tan. Imagery dated to the Early Iron Age is marked by a distinctly lighter patina, one easily spotted against the surrounding surface. At a further extreme, the pecked imagery of Turkic period riders and hunters is often white, as if the images were executed only yesterday. Subject matter, also, is a reliable but not absolute indicator of chronology. Studies of the paleoenvironment of North Asia indicate that megafauna disappeared by the onset of the Holocene. A large</page><page sequence="4">90 Mongolian Studies XXIX (2007) array of imagery from the Altai region indicates that yak were not domesticated until well into the Bronze Age, and the hunting of wild yak and cattle - or at least the representation of such hunts - appears to have disappeared by the late Bronze Age. Materials derived from excavations throughout the Altai, Sayan, and Minusinsk regions of South Siberia, as well as from evidence extracted from Chinese archaeology, indicate that wheeled vehicles appeared within our focus region during the full Bronze Age but disappeared from the visual record (although not, surely, from use) by the Early Iron Age. The emergence of herding, attested ubiquitously in North Asian burial finds of the Bronze Age, is corroborated by representations of herds of sheep and goats, horses, cattle and yak. Representations of riding also correlate with physical changes in the environment in the late 2nd millennium BCE and can be related to the beginnings of horse- dependent semi-nomadism in the late Bronze Age. Similarly, the long bow is a certain indicator of the Bronze Age (fig. 5) or of an earlier period, while the re-curved bow - most likely developed or adopted because the long bow could not be used effectively by a person on horseback - indicates a date no earlier than the late Bronze Age (fig. 6). The advent of riding in the late Bronze Age also affected other gear and apparel. By the late Bronze Age, herders had adopted the use of the gorytus, a particular form of quiver that could house both the arrows and the bow (fig. 6) and was typically carried over the herder's hip or high on his back. In petroglyphic imagery of that period, we see men dressed in the belted short tunics, close-fitting pants, soft boots and hoods that were distinctive aspects of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age apparel.5 Spear points, knives, daggers and other bronze implements are also good indicators of dating since they can be related to materials retrieved from dated excavations of the Bronze and Early Iron Ages. These subjects and implements serve as supplements to another indicator of chronology - style itself, or the particular manner in which subjects are rendered. The simple but monumental profile presentation of Pleistocene fauna contrasts with a more detailed, realistic style that can be identified with animals of the early or middle Holocene as well as with animals in scenes involving 'hero hunters'. The Bronze Age is noteworthy for a distinctive vitality in the treatment of both humans and animals. Even when still, Bronze Age animals appear to be as if on high alert (fig. 7); in many cases, however, they are shown in full flight, dashing pell-mell across a surface after another animal or before the threat of a hunter (fig. 8).</page><page sequence="5">Jacobson-Tepfer 91 Even the drivers of wheeled vehicles seem to be 'on the go,' as if rushing from one place in their rocky landscape to another (fig. 9). A heightened sense of psychological interaction is a hallmark of Bronze Age imagery: hunters crouch and take aim, herders lead and tend their animals, predators and prey are bound together in physical and psychological interplay. This vital sense of interaction began to disappear by the Early Iron Age. By that time and thereafter, when represented together within a scene of animal prédation or within a herd, animals increasingly lack the implication of action and response typical of the Bronze Age. Almost as frequently, animals are represented alone, with a formality and stylization that renders them more emblematic in expression than realistic (fig. 10). Moreover, the stylization that distinguishes animal imagery from the Early Iron Age is so frequently analogous in manner to that of imagery derived from contemporary burials that it is possible to be fairly certain about dating. Image overlay is yet another and particularly useful aspect of rock art that helps to indicate relative chronology. Obviously, when one image has been pecked over another, it is reasonable to assume that the lower image is succeeded by the upper image in time. When there is, in addition, a distinctive difference in image style, patina, and pecking technique we may come to some solid conclusions about relative and sometimes even absolute chronology. A case in point may be seen in figure 1 1 where an Early Bronze Age hunting scene has been laid over the faint image of an archaic birthing figure. In another instance, a dark, square animal is overlaid by an elongated stag of a considerably lighter hue (fig. 12). In this case, placement, hue, and technique of execution are useful indicators of different chronologies. In addition, the distinctively fine but squared style of the lower animal can be confidently associated with the Bronze Age, while the exaggerated stylization of the deer, so similar to that of deer on classical deer stones of northern Mongolia (Volkov 2002), can be confidently associated with the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. Bearing in mind this brief overview of image chronology, we may turn to a consideration of self-imagery in Altai rock art. The infrequent and crude representations of anthropomorphic figures in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods (fig. 2) indicate that human self-representation was of little or no interest in that archaic period. Rock artists were rather preoccupied with the non-human natural world filled by animals. We do not know whether these animal images were intended to refer to a spirit world, or - as a kind of</page><page sequence="6">92 Mongolian Studies XXIX (2007) hunting magic - to desired prey or whether they reflect a simple desire to represent the known and most significant world. It is clear, however, that human images were rarely if ever executed; when they do appear they are rudimentary and inexpressive. The 'hero-hunters' that began to appear in later pre-Bronze Age imagery are also of a specific type (fig. 3), but their clearer treatment as male hunters in opposition to animals suggests that the figures may have had a mythic significance and do not necessarily represent the everyday world of the artists. It is perhaps more than coincidence that these hunters are frequently paired with birthing women, or the scenes in which they appear are pecked over images of generic birthing figures (fig. 11). The fact that some of these birthing figures clearly predate the hunters and their prey indicates that they may be significantly older than those of the human males. This would suggest that images of birthing women were among the oldest anthropomorphic images we have from the Mongolian Altai. If that is the case, it is also probable that such stylized, inexpressive figures do not represent human beings per se but were understood as signs of human fertility or invocations of animal fertility.6 When they are deliberately joined with compositions including massive animals (Jacobson, Kubarev, Tseevendorj 2001: vol. II, pl. 21) or hunters and animals, or when such compositions overlay birthing figures, it is probable that they reflect archaic understandings that the taking of an animal had to be joined to rituals invoking animal renewal. By overlaying or juxtaposing the representation of a hunter and his animals with the simple sign of fertility, the artist perhaps intended to indicate the full cycle of life: the taking of animals and their replacement by the spirit world. As archaic as is the pairing of hunter and birthing woman, it does suggest the beginning of mythic narrative. The combination of these elements persisted into the full Bronze Age. This is suggested by a large boulder from Tsagaan Salaa IV which is literally covered by wild animals. In the section represented here (fig. 13), we see a hunter with bow in the upper right. Central to the large group of animals is another figure (far left), but this is clearly a birthing woman. Frontal, with arms raised and legs spread in response to the being she is birthing, she must represent the continuity, well into the Bronze Age, of an archaic hunting belief that what is taken must be replaced - but that replacement can only occur by invoking the realm of the ancestors or spirits. In a sense, then, such compositions evoke not only mythic traditions but also the image of a world kept in balance.</page><page sequence="7">Jacobson-Tepfer 93 We do not know if the early birthing women refer specifically to a spirit world. In northwestern Mongolia there are, however, strange figures that must refer to a non-human realm. The oldest such images resemble moths or bells with faceless heads and horns or feelers (e.g., Jacobson, Kubarev, Tseevendorj 2001: vol. II, pls. 77, 105, 106). In many cases they are represented alone, in other cases they are paired with animals that appear to be female or are given female powers. In one image, for example (ibid.: vol. II, pls. 76, 77), the legs of the bell- shaped figure suggest movement, but the head and 'body' have no definition. The figure is placed just above a female elk and a magnificent bovid; but even though the bovid has the power of a bull, within its body we see the indication of a smaller horned animal. Inside another bell-shaped figure (ibid.: vol. 1, fig. 792) is represented a small caprid. The most explicit indication of this figure's life-giving nature is found on a large panel from TS V (ibid.: vol. II, pls. 207, 208). On the left side of the panel appear a number of animals facing a large, bell-shaped figure with faceless head and 'horns.' Within the bell-shape, the figure has the definition of a human body and between its legs is clearly visible an emerging child. This composition seems to confirm that the bell-shaped image type, like the more generic birthing woman, has little to do with phenomenal existence except as a source of life. This figure most certainly refers to a mythic tradition in which was articulated the natural processes of a world in which the giving and taking of game supported a life of well-being. At some point in the Bronze Age something extraordinary began to emerge within the rock art repertory of the Altai Mountains. Compositions began to suggest a particular interest in the shapes and responses of the real world manifested in the expression of animal vitality and animal and human interaction. Humor, too, made its appearance, reflected in little animals with droll horns and plantigrade feet or in scenes of small animals chasing each other at full speed over the mountain-like surface of a boulder (e.g., ibid.: vol. II, pls. IX, 26, 297). In art of an earlier period, animals stood quietly in profile, impressive in their monumentality and idealized realism. In the Bronze Age, vitality was conveyed by the actual representation of speed and by the expression of a real chase (fig. 8). It appears, also, in vivid pictorial reflections of the force and effect of prédation, as when wolves or felines fall on an elk (ibid.: vol. II, pls. 43, 326). It is in the representations of human beings, however, that we sense the emergence of a new concern for self-representation and for the evocation of the tension and temper of the hunt. Between hunters</page><page sequence="8">94 Mongolian Studies XXIX (2007) and their prey we become aware of a keen sense of action and response, of psychological interconnection. On a large panel from the Upper Tsagaan Gol is represented a magnificent wild bull with humped shoulders and massive head (fig. 14). Around him on all sides can be seen several small hunters attacking the bull with spears and bows and arrows. The sense of a mythic hunt, or of a hunt happening in some liminal space, is conveyed by the contrast in the size of animal and men, the force with which the hunters are manipulating their weapons, and the impassive majesty of the bull. In a scene documented in Tsagaan Salaa I (fig. 5), the hunter's clothing and his long bow assert a date in the full Bronze Age. The man crouches with his body leaning forward in tension and his head somewhat turned as he aims his arrow and draws back his bow. Lower and to the left stands his prey, a large argali, its head lowered as if exhausted and cornered. Not only has the artist here created a keen sense of the interchange of hunter and hunted, he has also made use of an elegant surface in which natural striations effectively increase the psychological sense of connection between the hunter and his prey. In another hunting scene in the Upper Tsagaan Gol complex (fig. 8), two thin hunters take aim at several fleeing ibex and argali. The clarity of these animals' horns and bodies - vividly contrasted by the cruder and later animals above - is strikingly effective. No less vital are the animals running pell-mell away from the long bows of several Bronze Age hunters on a single rose-colored boulder from the same complex (fig. 15). In this case we seem to have wondered into the precincts of a painting of some Persian ruler's hunting party, so vivid and rooted in a keen perception of the real world is the treatment of animals and humans. In these several instances and in many, many others, it is always possible that the artists were representing scenes from a mythic world; but even if that were the case, the animals are endowed with the energy and naturalism of the phenomenal world. Similar observations may be made regarding scenes of human conflict, also datable to the Bronze Age by virtue of weapons and clothing apparel as well as by style. Such scenes are totally lacking from compositions datable to the pre-Bronze Age, but they occurred regularly although not frequently in the Bronze Age. In some cases these scenes involve several figures, suggesting a group raid or a conflict over hunting grounds (ibid.: vol. II, pls. 370, 371). In most cases, however, the scenes involve two or three figures and the reference seems more often to be to a family conflict or a duel between two figures (ibid.: vol. II, pls. 72, 75). In such scenes there is</page><page sequence="9">Jacobson-Tepfer 95 nothing to prove that the scenes do not refer to conflict in a spirit realm; but if the spirit world was the intended reference, the artists again shaped their mythic story in terms of the phenomenal world. A keener reflection appears in Bronze Age scenes of herding. In these panels, men and their animals - sheep and goats, horses, or cattle - affirm the emergence of a pastoral or at least semi-pastoral economy in the Altai region. On a large panel from the Upper Tsagaan Gol, several men are represented with their cattle (fig. 16). The refinement of the execution and the darkened patina of the figures and animals indicate a date well back in the Bronze Age. Nearby is found another large panel of horses, again executed with a remarkably fine technique (Jacobson-Tepfer, Kubrev, Tseveendorj 2006: II, pls. 447-450). The panel is broken and we see no remaining signs of human herders. The beauty of the horses and their number suggests that they are, again, a kind of evocation of a good life, one dependent on the well-being of animals. Another panel from the same complex shows more finely pecked horses and cattle, these accompanied by small figures with bows and arrows: herders most likely, ready to protect their animals (fig. 1 7). They are resolutely on foot, just as is the small figure in another beautifully pecked scene dominated by horses and argali, from the Baga Oigor valley (Jacobson, Kubarev, Tseevendorj 2001: vol. II, pls. 209, 210). That fact as well as their clothing, implements, and the techniques and styles with which the scenes are rendered insist upon a Bronze Age date. Two particularly beautiful scenes of herding, also clearly of Bronze Age date, involve magnificent bulls led by small women (Jacobson-Tepfer, Kubarev, Tseveendorj 2006: vol. I, figs. 713, 735). A later scene, datable to the late Bronze Age and to the period when people were already riding and using short bows, can be found, also, in the Upper Tsagaan Gol complex. In this case the figure stands on a 'trail,' leading his horses, his quiver and bow on his back (fig. 1 8). The most articulate indications of a 'good life' in the Bronze Age are found in the many scenes of family caravans from Mongolian Altai rock art.7 These scenes are usually centered on massive yak carrying large loads reminiscent of the household goods piled high on camels used even today by Mongolian herders. As if to emphasize the wealth of the household, these yak also carry children or other figures. Several representations from Baga Oigor I give a vivid sense of this caravan. In one scene (Jacobson, Kubarev, Tseevendorj 2001: vol. I, fig. 715), a woman with long braids briskly leads three loaded bulls. In another small scene (ibid.: vol. I, fig. 710), a young girl sits upon a</page><page sequence="10">96 Mongolian Studies XXIX (2007) fine yak. A large panel higher in the section is centered by a fine, massive animal loaded with household goods (fig. 19). In a smaller scene from Baga Oigor II, two children can be seen within the basket on the yak's back (ibid.: vol. II, pl. 262). One of the earliest such scenes, this from the Upper Tsagaan Gol, is at once one of the finest but also most difficult to see (Jacobson-Tepfer, Kubarev, Tseveendorj 2006: vol. II, pls. 505-508). In the center of the panel can be seen a small woman carrying a finely tasseled sack and surrounded by four massive and one smaller yak. The largest animal carries a number of children in the basket on his huge, humped back. Above this group are two copulating couples - suggestive of another aspect of well-being - and to the far right side of the panel is a tall hunter with a club. His role is certainly one we can see more clearly in other panels and in a later panel from higher in the Tsagaan Gol complex (fig. 20). In that composition, a fine yak is led by a woman in a long dress, her hair apparently arranged in many braids. On the back of the bull is seated a large figure - perhaps an older person - and behind and before the small caravan scene are hunters, one shooting a stag. Wherever these hunting scenes occur with caravan scenes - and they do so regularly- -they conjure up the movement of herders with their household goods through a natural world of abundant game. One of the finest panels in this genre comes from Baga Oigor III and includes representations of a man and of a woman leading a fine bull (Jacobson, Kubarev, Tseevendorj 2001 : vol. I, figs. 979, 980). They and the two small girls on the left side of the surface face out, as if posing for a photograph. They are surrounded by horses, wild animals and birds. Nearby, hardly visible now, are two carts. Beautifully pecked and fitted to the triangular surface on which it appears, this scene suggests an ancient analogy to modern images of the good life: where the people are beautiful, their belongings ample, their lands abundant with animals and where, in addition, the family owns two fine carts. A large scene from Baga Oigor I (ibid.: I, fig. 779) is cruder but still expressive of household wealth. Some figures, including at least one woman, lead loaded and unloaded yak. The style in which the animals are rendered and the treatment of the large figures indicates a date for such compositions in the late Bronze Age. A large composition on a flat surface from Baga Oigor III (ibid.: vol. II, pls. 332-334) is datable to the same period but is far more beautifully conceived and rendered. It is curious that such scenes of herding and caravanning seem to disappear with the coming of the Early Iron Age. One exception is offered by a large panel from Baga Oigor IV (ibid.: vol. I, fig. 427),</page><page sequence="11">Jacobson-Tepfer 97 but this lacks the careful evocation of details that one sees in older scenes. More typical of the Early Iron Age are scenes of hunts, in which the animals have become stylized; and while sometimes elegant, they lack vitality (ibid.: vol. I, fig. 1191; vol. II, pls. XXV, XXVI) or are effectively deadened by conventionalization (ibid.: vol. I, fig. 1142). If we try to extrapolate meaning from the scenes referred to above and from many others from the Mongolian Altai, we could say that in the Bronze Age the good life was described in terms of family well- being - itself defined in terms of the integrity of a nuclear family with several children, in terms of ample livestock and, occasionally, in terms of the possession of one or more fine carts. Necessary, also, to the preservation of well being in this world was abundant hunting - that is, a world rich in wild game. The pictorial record indicates clearly that the domestic realm was understood to be enwrapped in the natural, wild world and that the fertility of a family's herds was somehow related to the abundance of wild game. This balance between herd animals and game is delightfully evoked in a large panel from Tsagaan Sala II (Jacobson, Kubarev, Tseevendorj 2001: vol. II, pls. 70, 71). In that scene several figures are ranged among and around domesticated goats and cattle, including two that are copulating. Around this group and intruding into its edges are wild animals. The interconnection in this panel between two spheres - the wild and the domestic - measures, in a sense, the transformation of a self-consciousness first reflected in pre-Bronze Age rock art representations of birthing women. In those scenes, in later scenes of 'hero hunters' superimposed on archaic birthing women images or in images of strange, bell-shaped figures with some kind of life-giving function we sense the conviction that the source of life and its continuity were embedded in the wild world and the realm of the spirits. That balance changed, however, by the full Bronze Age. With the appearance of men herding large animals or of men and women leading caravans of animals and yaks carrying their household goods, the pivot of that balance seems to have shifted to the domestic realm. Through their animals, offspring, and household goods, people seemingly came to control their well being in this world even if they still depended on the hunting of wild animals. The 'good life' was family and herd centered, it was one in which wild animals appeared on the periphery of the socialized world. For whatever reason, the concerns we see reflected in Bronze Age rock art essentially disappeared by the beginning of the Iron Age.</page><page sequence="12">98 Mongolian Studies XXIX (2007) Scenes of herding and caravanning, or of animals racing at full tilt across a rock landscape, are replaced by hunting scenes and by images of stylized animals, in groups or alone. Clearly other concerns had become dominant; if there were still agreed upon conceptions of the good life, they must have become lodged in other materials - perhaps those related to burial customs or those embedded in oral tales.
