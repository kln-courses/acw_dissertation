Pp. 240. $80.00. This revision of the author's doctoral dissertation is presented in four chapters and a conclusion. The first chapter, "The Study of the Isaiah Scroll," includes remarks on scribal aspects of the 1QIsaa scroll, the largest biblical text from Qumran. It contains 1,573 well-preserved lines in fifty-four columns. The remarks include research on the scroll that touches on the aims and purpose of his study. He points out that while the bulk of about 1,200 variants between the scroll and BHK are orthographic, they are not all of this nature. Distinct orthographic differences are noted between the first thirty- three chapters of the scroll and the following chapters. He minimizes the suggestion that the scrolls were written by two scribes or that the same scribe used two different Vorlagen and favors E. Y. Kutscher's suggestion that a single scribe copied both sections as he was struggling with a new system of orthography. This conclusion is based on an observation by Kutscher and others that the change in orthography was gradual and not abrupt. The author's primary interest is in the kinds of variants in the scroll. He states that a prejudice that the scroll's variants were due to scribal errors has dominated the discus- sion. He describes errors as those where the text fails to fit the context and where no other explanations are possible. In short, the scribe of 1QIsaa did poor work according to past opinion. He notes, however, that there are writers who have suggested that a num- ber of variants are interpretative readings of that scribe. These authors include W. H. Brownlee and A. van der Kooij. While he appreciates their efforts to pursue this line of thinking, he largely discounts their labors, attributing their analysis to "scholarly preju- dices" (an oxymoron?). He then appraises Kutscher's extensive work, which fundamentally relegates vari- ants to differences in the linguistic milieu of the Second Temple period. He criticizes Kutscher for failing to analyze the differences for the "immediate linguistic context." By</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 557 this he means that Kutscher did not utilize scribal conventions in other Qumran texts as well as the scroll's physical presence in the same geographical region. He cites examples of Kutscher's failure to realize differences not due to linguistic adaptation. Nevertheless he concedes that linguistic influences are one facet that contributes to an analysis of interpretive readings. Awareness of Kutscher's work is extensive throughout. Subsequently, he discusses the aims and approach of his own work. Because of the "stricter framework" of past critics, all variants were assigned to mechanical errors that either discounted or neglected other possibilities, namely, interpretive readings. This "stricter framework" assumed that the Qumran scribes used the same standards of the later Masoretic scribes whose aim was to copy the Hebrew text without any deviations. This viewpoint Pulikottil is right to address. While creative scribal activity at Qumran appears to be beyond question, given the history of scribal activity in the ancient Near East, one cannot assume that the later "stricter framework" was not maintained by some non-Qumran scribes, a clear probability given the nature of Scripture. The issue then rests on the attitude and purpose of the Qumran scribes in transmitting a biblical text. Pulikottil asserts that these scribes considered biblical texts as "changeable and suscepti- ble to further literary growth." The author then proceeds to develop his point in an anal- ysis of 1QIsaa. It is an appropriate starting point because the consonantal text of this scroll is basically the same as the MT. The author states that he will pursue his task by exploring the most important indi- cators of change, unique readings of the manuscript. Unique readings pertain to clear divergent patterns between the scroll and both the BHS and LXX. These readings, the author asserts, are the product of the scribe of the scroll and not a copy of his Vorlage. Pulikottil claims that the unique readings in this Isaiah scroll reflect language contem- porary with a later age than its Vorlage and that the readings are for the most part unique to this scroll. He illustrates his case with a treatment of an omission of part of a text in Isa 2:9-11, which he calls a "concrete example." Since he uses this pericope as his model, it seems a fair place to weigh his work. He notes that the scroll omits 2:9b-10. Since BHS, the LXX, the Targum, and the Peshitta (Syriac) have this reading, he assumes that the scribe of 1QIsaa consciously omits it. The reason for this omission is that the scribe, in the author's opinion, sees this pericope interrupting the flow of the passage. Hence the deleting of these "intervening" words. But it seems this explanation is incomplete. He needs to explain why, on the other hand, the scribe did not delete the same words that appear in 2:19 in the scroll? There may be a reason for this, but it should be explained. He then claims an intentional scribal reading of the use of an imperfect in the scroll for a perfect consecutive in the Vorlage. Is this a Qumran scribal convention? Since Isa 2:9b-10 is the exemplar, why does the author not demonstrate here how this corresponds to the "immediate linguistic background" that he accuses Kutscher of neglecting? "Scribal Activity in the Scroll" is the title of the second and longest chapter. The chapter is structured under different categories that explain different reasons for scribal deviation. These are harmonization, explication, modernization, and contextual changes. By harmonization the author refers to changes of a text due to the influence of another text, either in the immediate context, or in passages in the same book or other books in the OT in order to make so-called secondary approximations of detail. He suggests that the main purpose of the scribe's harmonizing texts was for explication, a prototype of</page><page sequence="3">558 Journal of Biblical Literature techniques later employed by Jewish exegetes. He provides about thirty examples. Explication refers to clarifications and interpretations of the text that are nonharmo- nious. These are "interruptions" of the text for clarity in meaning. For example, the sign of the object, the accusative marker, is added in some cases where the scribe's Vorlage does not have it, resulting in some ambiguity as to what is nominative and what is accusative. Modernization of the scroll is self-explanatory and, candidly, largely relies on the work of E. Y. Kutscher. Pulikottil purports, "various changes to update the language and to use the more current words and phrases including spelling are a further confir- mation of his preoccupation with the transmission of meaning of his text rather than replicating its form." Contextual changes pertain to the rewriting of grammatical and syntactical irregularities in the context. Irregularities concern changes in gender, tenses, numbers, verbal suffixes, and voice. Some of reasons for these changes overlap or could be subsumed with some of the previous categories, something that Pulikottil concedes. His treatment and the preponderance of illustrations persuasively argue his case; the scroll is replete with scribal invention. The third chapter, "The 'Tradition' of the Scroll," pertains to the specific types of exegetical concerns of the scribe of the scroll. These concerns are divided into historical and theological concerns. Historical concerns are scribal inventions to reconcile what the scribe perceived to be historical inaccuracies of his Vorlage or to update the text with additional historical details. For example, the scribe adds "Samaria" to Isa 37:13, a detail presumably not reported in his Vorlage. Perfect tenses are changed to imperfect tenses for the so-called prophetic perfect. Theological correctness is the second reason for scribal inventions. This type of correction seems very much like the tiqqane s6pr-im. Corrections are made so that the Hebrew text does not appear to dishonor God, particu- larly to avoid anthropomorphism. A change in the scroll of a preposition in Isa 28:21 avoids comparing God with an inanimate object: "God will rise up like Mt. Perazim" (MT), "God will rise up at Mt. Perazim"(1QIsaa). This discourse follows with scribal changes in the scroll that are not neatly classified as historical or theological. These changes lead the author to conclude that the scribe had a concern to promote a parochial viewpoint. The fourth chapter is entitled "The Milieu of the Scroll." First the author ques- tions the assumption that the scroll is Essene in origin: ". .. the notion that the so called 'Qumran texts' are of Essene origin is severely contested." Second, he dismisses van der Kooij's position that the scroll's origin should be assigned to the Qumran sect's leader, the Teacher of Righteousness. Such an interpretation is too speculative and restrictive. N. Golb's hypothesis that the scrolls were brought to the caves by Jews of diverse back- grounds after the fall of Galilee and the siege of Jerusalem represents for this author "the farthest extreme." However, according to Pulikottil, scholars have objected to the idea that Qumran texts represent only one community and their history and beliefs. Thus, M. O. Wise's opinion that the Dead Sea Scrolls are not the product of one group because of their diversity has gained a foothold. It seems clear that the scrolls do not reflect a uniform community or a uniformity of beliefs. In deference to the above opinions, Pulikottil turns to internal evidence in this Isa- iah scroll for a solution. In this regard he notes that the scroll has some relation to the so- called Yahad documents. These documents are those copied by a school (?) of scribes who observed a common conceptual ideology. Their ideology is represented by themes</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 559 such as temple, study of the Torah, separation of the community, antagonism, the role of foreigners, violence, and so on. The author goes to some length to establish his point. His final chapter, "Conclusion," summarizes the efforts of each chapter. It may be help- ful to read this first, especially if one has not had any orientation to the study of Qumran scrolls and/or textual criticism. This work concludes with several appendices, a bibliog- raphy, and indices to Scripture, Qumran documents, and authors. This work, in my opinion, highlights the proposition that Qumran scribes assumed a great deal of freedom in rendering the biblical text and the author's conclusion that "there was no consensus on how this should be done." His work strongly suggests indi- vidualistic approaches to the scrolls by scribes with the probability that they were guided by some common ideologies. These scribes were not strict copyists, a practice mistak- enly ascribed only to later scribes in the MT tradition against the explicit statements in rabbinic literature of a guarded text maintained in the Second Temple. To a greater extent, the Yahad scribes provided an interpretation of texts to suit, to a measurable degree, their own biases. Whether the scribe of this scroll was a Yahad scribe or not, this author has adequately demonstrated that the Isaiah scroll was subjected to scribal manipulation. This, in my opinion, means that Qumran texts so handled should receive only minimal consideration regarding canonical issues. Certainly biases of one Jewish scribe or even one scribal school are too limited to provide wider conclusions beyond its own witness. Given the subjectivity of textual criticism, this work has much to commend it. It is a good model to begin with for the uninitiated who aspire to pursue the practice of textual criticism.
