The historical background to the Nigerian 'flood' is the encounter between the Senegalese Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse (d. 1975) and a dynamic sector of the scholarly class of Kano. Two case-studies of local tafsir networks are presented here in order to assess the position that the studying, the teaching and the public performing of tafsir had in the broader edifice of Islamic knowledge of the West African city before and after the 'flood'. The article emphasizes the intensity of the participation of the West African Mus lim scholars to the intellectual tradition o? tafsir, and looks at the links between a contemporary Sufi revival, local traditions of Quranic exegesis, and wider bodies of Islamic knowledge.

(d. 1815), transmitted in a collection of his sayings published as al-If?da al-ahmadiyya? Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse would expose his arguments justifying his conviction that he was the depository of the flood of Shaykh Ahmad at-Tij?n? in the book K?shifal-ilb?s, which he wrote in 1931. At the core of the fayda rationale as it was articulated by Ibr?h?m Niasse and his followers was the idea that the Senegalese Sufi had the role and mission of spreading a technique of a particularly effective?though simplified and accessible to everyone?system of spiritual training {tarbiyd) in the method of Shaykh Ahmad at-Tij?n?.

(d. 1978). I have discussed some of the meanings associated with the term fayda in the Tij?n? tradition in Brigaglia, A.: "The Fayda Tij?niyya of Ibrahim Nyass: Genesis and Implications of a Sufi Doctrine", in: Islam et Soci?t?s au Sud du Sahara (Paris), 14/15, 2001.</page><page sequence="3">336 A.

Such an 'empirical' evidence of the fayda was not open to being counter-argued from the outside, for it could only be believed or questioned after having undergone the Niassene tarbiya, i.e. after having accepted his spiritual mastership. The theoretical background of the esoteric practice of tarbiya itself was nothing new.4 What was peculiar to the followers of Ibrahim Niasse was the claim that through the intercession of the deposi tory of the flood its experience would easily become accessible to all, though at different degrees of realization. Niasses claims were strengthened by the fact that some representatives of the major Tij?n? families of the Idaw 'All clan in Mauritania, who were the heirs of the oldest initiatic chain (silsila) of the order in sub-Saharan Africa, had earnestly (and surprisingly, if one considers the traditional atti tude of 'white' Mauritanians towards 'black' Senegalese) submitted to the spiritual authority of a very young Ibrahim and recognized 3) The claims of the followers of Ibr?h?m Niasse have sometimes met with opposition from other Tij?nis in local contexts; an example of this kind, relative to the Darfur (Western Sudan) has been treated by R?diger Seesemann: "The history of the Tij?niyya and the issue of tarbiya in Darfur (Sudan)", in: D. Robinson &amp; J.-L. Triaud (eds.), La Tij?niyya: Une confr?rie musulmane ? la conqu?te de l'Afrique, Paris: Karthala, 2001. 4) Before the Senegalese, the concept of tarbiya in the Tij?ni path had been discussed theoretically by the Mauritanian 'Ubayda b. Anb?ja in his Miz?b al-rahma al-rahm?niyya, which has been identified as one of the most important sources of Ibr?h?m Niasse on the subject (Seesemann: "The Shuraf?' and the Blacksmith", 94). The progression of the hadar?t as it is discussed in cUmar al-F?tfs Rim?h {Rim?h hizb al-rah?m, published on the margins of Ali Har?zim Bar?da: Jaw?hir al-ma(?n? wa-bul?gh al-aml?ni, Bayr?t: D?r al-J?l, no date) also constitutes an important antecedent in the order, as it attached in a systematic way the traditional Sufi idea of the cosmic hierarchy of the hadar?t to the specific hierarchy of sainthood envisaged by Tij?nis based on the claim that the founder Shaykh Ahmad at-Tij?ni is the kh?tim al-awliy?' ('seal of saints') and the exclusive vehicle of the Muhammadan fayd (effusion). The book al-Ir?'a (Ir?'at 'ar?'is s humus falak al-haq?'iq al-lirf?niyya, Casablanca, 1934) by the Moroccan al-Hasan {Sidi Lahsan) aJ-Bacqili is another important Tij?ni book on the subject of tarbiya, and it is used in Moroc co and Tunisian zdwiyas.</page><page sequence="4">A.

The spread of the tar?qa was, in fact, an essential element in the prediction attributed to Shaykh Ahmad at-Tij?n?: a flood (fayda) will occur, so that people will enter my order in swarms (afwdjanY6. For almost twenty years however, the claims that Ibr?h?m Niasse had put forward in his K?shif al-ilb?s and that his Mauritanian supporters had endorsed would remain virtually inconsequential outside a local, marginal circle of Senegalese and Mauritanians that had started gathering around him and renewing their affiliation (silsila) to the Tij?n? path through him. It was only starting from the 1950s, after the affiliation of a vast and particularly dynamic sector of the scholarly class of the Northern Nigerian city of Kano, that the movement started to acquire a visible international dimension and to transform the geography of the Tij?niyya that had been remained virtually unchanged through the colonial age. Through the medium of the Kano scholars and of the (often commercial, side by side scholarly) networks they run through Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Chad and the Cameroon, the promise of a mass initiation into the Tij?niyya order at the hand of the depository of the fayda will be realized. In particular, the idea that the Sufi tarbiya, the initiatic training leading to spiritual realization could be made accessible to the common folk would be systematically believed and employed for the first time on a large scale. The Kano scholars' recognition of Ibr?h?m Niasse gave a decisive impetus to the Tij?n? flood, and fixed the hagiographical record of the movement around five core elements: 1) a prediction by the order's founder; 2) an 'unveiling' (muk?shafa) received by Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse; 3) the endorsement of the latter by some key sources of authority 5) The significance of the Mauritanian link in the career of Ibrahim Niasse is discussed thoroughly in Seesemann: "The Shuraf?' and the Blacksmith". 6) Sufy?n?: al-If?da, 83.</page><page sequence="5">338 A.

The events that occurred in Kano, though obviously connected with the general history of the movement, were also rooted in the cultural ambiance of the Nigerian town, and can be appreciated to their fullest from the point of view of its intellectual and religious history. This is what this article will try to do, and such was already the approach of John Paden in his book Religion and Political Culture in Kano, whose sections on the Tij?niyya provide abundant insights into the history of the order in the Nigerian city to the early 1960s.8 7) Shaykh Ahmad Sukayrij was the main source of authority in the tariqa of Shaykh Ibrahim's father, al-H?jj Abd Allah Niasse. Ibrahim also met him in 1936, when he first visited Morocco. Sukayrij was a q?dz and a Sufi, and was widely considered as the foremost spiritual authority of the Tij?niyya in the early twentieth century. 8) Paden, J.: Religion and Political Culture in Ka?io, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973, 73-145. The date of Shaykh Ibrahim's first visit to Nigeria that set off the realignment of the Kano Hausa scholarly class, identified by John Paden as 1938, has been reassessed by R?diger Seesemann, with evidence from Ibrahim Niasses own travelogues and other writings, as 1945 (oral communication; see also Seesemann: "The Shurafiz'and the Black smith", 85). In a first-hand written account by the Nigerian Muhammad ath-Th?n? b. al-Hasan K?fangh? (K?fangh?, M. Th., Ris?ia fi t?rikh majV ash-Shaykh Ibrahim Iny?s U? Kan? awwal marra, Kano: Northern Maktabat Printing Press, no date, 41) the date is stated as 1364/1944-45, at the end of'the war to Hitler'. Paden claims that the first, pre-war visit was kept secret, but does not mention his sources. K?fangh?'s above-quoted risala adds that the Moroccan Shaykh Ahmad Sukayrij was communicated in a dream of Shaykh Ahmad at-Tij?ni two verses of poetry that had to be sent to Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse, urging him to postpone his trip to Fez and Kano after the end of the war (K?fangh?: Ris?ia, 43; in this verse, Shaykh at-Tij?ni addresses the Senegalese as 'authentic inheritor of my secret'). The fact that the Senegalese traveled to Nigeria after World War II modifies significantly the chronology of the events as narrated in Paden's book, but the main arguments put forward as explanation of the transition from the point of view of the town's political history remain valid: in a time of commercial and political growth of Kano, the Emir Abdull?hi Bayero and his entourage of Fulani 'ulam?' found in the Tij?niyya Niy?ssiyya an avenue to promote the independence of Kano Emirate from the Sultan of Sokoto, traditionally linked to the Q?diriyya, while the Hausa and Kanuri scholars who were associated with the commoners and the traders of the city were attracted by the idea of the mass participation to Sufism, that echoed their aspiration to increased social participation.</page><page sequence="6">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 339 Ibr?h?m Niasse met for the first time with the Emir of Kano Abdull?hi Bavero in Mecca, during the pilgrimage rites of 1937.9 Abdull?hi Bayero had previously been persuaded by his religious counselor and minister, Wall Sulaym?n (d. 1939), that during the trip he would meet with the ghawth az-zam?n (the savior of the age), the highest rank in the esoteric hierarchy of Sufi saints at every given time. Returning to Nigeria, Abdull?hi Bayero informed his closest associates among the Tij?n? scholars in Kano of his meeting with Ibr?h?m Niasse and of the station (maq?m) that he reportedly had. The prestige of the Senegalese spread first among the scholarly families that were associated with the aristo cracy of the town. Then, when Ibr?h?m Niasse visited Kano after the war bringing some copies of his books (a key text being the K?shif al-ilb?s), his influence also started to spread among another influential circle of Tij?n? scholars of the city, those formed in legal studies at the hand of Muhammad Saiga (d. 1938). Most of the salg?w?, as this network of scholars was known in Kano, affiliated to the Senegalese, and a group of them followed him in Kaolack to undergo personalized training in Sufism. Upon their return, they would begin a capillary action of promotion of the Tij?niyya and would engage in a remarkable literary activity. Based on these two processes, John Paden identifies the role of the movement he calls 'reformed Tij?niyya, and the reason behind its success, in overcoming the ethnic cleavages that affected the expanding but separate Tij?n? circles existing in Kano at the beginning of the twentieth century: a Fulani scholarly class close to W?l? Sulaym?n, the Emir and his power base, which had been animated principally by the Mauritanian Sharif Ujd?d, and a Hausa and Kanuri scholarly class (principally represented by the followers of Muhammad Saiga), which was associated with traders and commoners and whose link to the Tij?niyya had been revived in the 1920s by a visit of the Moroccan Muhammad al-Alam? (d. 1969).10 The realignment of these two groups 9) Paden: Religion and Political Culture, 97. 10) Muhammad al-cAlam? founded the first public z?wiya of the order in Kano city, in the Northern ward of Koki. For the activities of this Tij?n? center, and of the major figures who animated it (Muhammad Saiga and Abu Bakr Mijinyawa), see Paden: Religion and Political Culture, 87-90. It is worth noting that both Ujd?d and al-Alam? were disciples of the Moroccan Mahammad al-Naz?f? (d. 1943), a scholar of Marrakesh. In a poem on</page><page sequence="7">340 A. Brigaglia / Die Welt des L lams 49 (2009) 334-366 of scholars under the leadership of Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse?concludes Paden?reunited the Tij?n? scholarly community of Kano under a single, external authority provided with a solid international arrangement. Other significant contributions to the study of the fayda tijdniyya movement in Kano are an article by Mervyn Hiskett11 and an unpub lished thesis by Ibrahim Tahir.12 While the first connects the expansion of the movement to its promise of broadening the access to spiritual attainments commonly reserved to an elite of ascetics, the second illustrates the correspondences between the expansion of Kano as an international commercial center at the half of the century and the construction of the fayda tijdniyya network. The present article, which originates from a research on the develop ments of networks of taf sir studies in contemporary Northern Nigeria,13 explores the impact of the fayda tijdniyya transition upon the wider networks of Islamic knowledge in the Northern Nigerian metropolis of Kano. John Paden has already stressed the role of the tij?n? flood' in inspiring a sort of'literary renaissance' in Kano and a boom of religious the Tij?nl path (al-Y?q?ta al-farida), Nazlf? had some verses that mentioned the coming of the fayda and emphasized its connection to the end of time. These verses would be quoted by the followers of the fayda tij?niyya as an anticipation of the achievements of Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse. It is possible that the expectation of the fayda was a theme that was discretely emphasized by some disciples of Naz?f?, and that the link to the Moroccan scholar revived in Kano by Ujd?d and al-Alami in the 1920s was an important element to create the humus of expectations upon which the fayda of Ibr?h?m Niasse would blossom a few years later. n) Hiskett: "The Community of Grace". This article, in fact, observes the emergence of the fayda tij?niyya (here named 'the Community of Grace') among the Hausa-speaking Muslim communities of urban Togo and Ghana, and is not directly concerned with Nigeria as such. The Tij?n? communities of Togo and Ghana, however, after the 1960s were largely dependant upon the Nigerian (Kano) link. 12) Tahir, I.A.: Scholars, Sufis, Saints and Capitalists in Kano 1904-1974: the Pattern of a Bourgeois Revolution in an Islamic Society, unpublished PhD Thesis, Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1975. 13) In two preceding articles drawing on the same research, I have looked at written Hausa translations of the Qur'?n (Brigaglia, A.: "Two recent Hausa translations of the Qur'an and their doctrinal background", in: journal of Religion in Africa, 35, 4, 2005) and at oral tafslr broadcast through the radio (Brigaglia, A.

As one of the salg?w? scholars/traders and a chief protagonist of the transition says: We had been hoping to acquire from our masters?may the mercy of God be upon them?the second major component of Sufi knowledge, that is, being drawn (al-jadhb) to the divine presence {al-hadra al-qudsiyyd), but we did not succeed to achieve that from them. What they had been pointing us to, and trained in?may God reward them abundantly?was only the first component of Sufism, which is compulsory to every Muslim {fard ayn): acquitting blameworthy qualities from oneself, and acquiring praiseworthy ones. This is what is referred to conventionally as 'the etiquette of the spiritual path' {?dab as-sul?k), and it is the subject about which al-Im?m al-Ghazali has written in the second half of his book 'the Revivification' {al-Ihya), praised by an erudite with the verse: Tf you want to be brought back to life / stick to what you find in the Revivification. All the books and poems of our scholars, of Shaykh cUthm?n (Dan Fodio), the reviver of religion, of his brother (Abd Allah Dan Fodio) and his son (Muhammad Bello) revolve around the first component (of Sufism) [...]. But when I met with the Shaykh [Ibrahim Niasse]?may God be pleased with him?, and he was shown something about me, he said: 'what do you want?' I answered: T hope from 14) Paden: Religion and Political Culture, 117. As a literary phenomenon in the history of the region, the boom of Tij?n? authorship in Kano is probably the most important develop ment after the one that had been inspired by the Dan Fodio family and its associates in connection with the Fulani jih?d between the end the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century. For an overview of the literary output of the two groups, see Hunwick J.O. (comp.): Arabic Literature of ^Africa, vol. II, Leiden: Brill, 1995, 52-212 (the Van Fodio family) and 256-316 (the Kano Tij?n?s of the twentieth century). 15) Paden: Religion and Political Culture, 125ff. 16) See Wright Z.V.: On the Path of the Prophet: Shaykh Ahmad Tijani and the Tariqa Muhammadiyya, Atlanta: The African-American Islamic Institute, 2005: especially Ch.

He said: 'this is nothing difficult to God'. And indeed, it was as he had said, may God be pleased with him.17 The fact that the fayda tij?niyya group emphasized direct taste (dhawq) of spiritual knowledge (ma'rifd) was certainly true as stressed by John Paden and confirmed by Muhammad ath-Th?n? {Sani) K?fanghas account. This is not sufficient, however, to assess the group s impact in Kano intellectual and religious life. The strategies these scholars imple mented to enhance the impact of the fayda tij?niyya in the public arena of Kano, in fact, will be focused?as will be seen below?on the dis semination of Islamic knowledge, with a special emphasis on taf ir, and not on ubiquitous ecstatic gatherings of dhikr. The doctrines on cos mology, prophethood and sainthood from which the spiritual practices of the group derived their meaningfulness were understood in the light of the Qur'anic paradigm, and transmitted between the lines of God's own words. Public sessions of tafsir were from the very beginning a chief element of the fayda revival in Kano, involving a profound intro version (in the sense of 'twisting inward') of the standard parameters of interpretation, which on its turn would reinforce the extroversion (movement outward, 'flood') of the scholarly group who championed it. Islamic Education and taf sir Studies in Kano Some important contributions have been made to the history and to the anthropology of Islamic education and learning in West Africa. While the elementary level of Qur'?nic education has drawn mainly the attention of anthropologists18, historians and scholars of Islamic 17) K?fangh?: Ris?ia, 45. 18) For an introduction to Qur'?nic schooling in a West African society (Jenne in Mali) and to the esoteric practices that were associated with it, see the works of Geert Mommersteeg (especially Mommersteeg, G.: "L'?ducation coranique au Mali: le pouvoir des mots sacr?s", in: B. Sanankoua &amp; L. Brenner (eds.): L'enseignement islamique au Mali, Bamako: Jamana, 1991). Other useful materials on the subject, always with a regional focus, are the works of Corinne Fortier on Mauritania (Fortier, C.: ' M?morisation et audition: l'enseignement coranique chez les Maures de Mauritanie", in: hlam et Soci?t?s au Sud du Sahara, Paris, 11,</page><page sequence="10">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 343 studies have focused primarily on the formation of literate classes and the multiple ways they have engaged political power.19 Traditional education in Muslim West Africa was often characterized by a markedly initiatic nature. A deep fracture was maintained between the methodology of the elementary level, prior to puberty and intel lectual maturity and focused only on the passive memorization of the Qur'?n and on the practical embodiment of the essential markers of a Muslim life, and that of the higher level, which promoted the active search of knowledge of various disciplines at the feet of several individ ual masters. The curricula of the secondary level of education, which 1997; Fortier, C: "Une p?dagogie coranique: modes de transmission des savoirs islamiques (Mauritanie)", in: Cahiers d'Etudes Africaines, 169/170, 2003) and of Renaud Santerre on Cameroon (Santerre, R.: P?dagogie musulmane d'Afrique Noire, Montr?al: Presse de l'Univer sit? De Montr?al, 1973), as well as Seydou Ciss?'s book on Islamic education in Africa (Ciss?, S.: L'enseignement islamique en Afrique de l'Ouest, Paris: L'Harmattan, 1992)? focused also on Mali, its title notwithstanding. Louis Brenner's monograph {Controlling Knowledge: Religion, Power and Schooling in a West African Muslim Society, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), which reconstructs the transformations of Islamic edu cation in Mali from a anthropological, political and sociological perspective, with a wealth of historical data, is the most comprehensive interpretative essay on Islam and education in Africa to date.

In a context of broad curricular freedom, where the student usually chooses the subjects and the books he will study and addresses them without observing a strict sequential order and time schedule (some fiqh and some linguistics being con sidered, however, as fundamental and propedeutic), the study of tafi?r makes exception, and access to it is often restricted in some way, either formally?in some cases allowing the study of tafslr only after the symbolic age of forty (the conventional age of prophecy)?or informally, by discouraging a student who is yer to undergo a thorough training in all the subsidiary disciplines to start attending tafslr classes.21 On the whole, a strong initiatic meaning is attached to the study of tafslr in the formation of a Muslim scholar in West Africa, tafi?r studying being the phase that marks the consecration of a senior Muslim scholar and his access to the circle of the ulama. Just as the circular process of learning is started as a child by concentrating on the passive memoriza tion of the Qur'an, and continued as a student by experiencing a certain degree of'dispersal' into multiplicity through the study of a number of apparently independent disciplines, it is also sealed by reverting back 20) A systematic study of the Malian majlis?the Traditional setting of private higher Islamic education?has been attempted during the last few years by Tal Tamari.

Other researches in different regions of West Africa have also sug gested that a special value is accorded to tafsir, often an initiatic one. Lamine Sanneh, in his classic study of the Mande-speaking Jakhank? clerical clan of Senegambia has pointed to the turbanning of a tafsir scholar as the traditional ceremony marking the definitive acquisition of the status of a senior Jakhank? scholar,22 while Elghassem has com pared tafsir-study'mg in Mauritania to a sort of university' of traditional Islamic education.23 The restriction of the study of tafsir to small circles of scholars often meant that its practitioners rigidly attached themselves to a very limited set of sources, which they surrounded with a semi-sacral value.24 In West Africa the nucleus of the exegetical tradition, the source that enjoyed universal recognition as the authentic', essential core of tafsin had been since the sixteenth century the concise exegesis of Jal?l ad-D?n al-Mahall? and Jal?l ad-D?n as-Suyut? known as Tafsir al-jal?layn. The Tafsir al-jal?layn was used with all probability as an Arabic model for oral translations of the Qur'?n into local languages. The discipline of tafsir in West Africa, in fact, was prevalently an oral activity, and was performed during the month of Ramad?n as a sort of ritual to reinforce the piety of the Muslim community and to renew its bond to the Qur'?nic revelation, but rarely had it become an arena for the negotiation of theological orthodoxy as it often had in the Middle East during the Middle Age. In West Africa, limiting access to the more complex (and often doctrinally sectarian) classical tafsir s to very restricted and cohesive circles of scholars was a strategy to avoid theological controversy. 22) Sanneh, L.: The Jakhanke Muslim Clerics: A Religious and Historical Study of Islam in Senegambia, University Press of America, 1989. 23) Elghassem, O.A.: Enseignement traditionnel en Mauritanie: la mahadra ou l'?cole '? dos de chameau, Paris: L'Harmattan, 1997, 73. 24) A certain caution towards t?/??r-studying and t?/r/r-making is in no way exclusive to West Africa, and the very fact that commenting upon God's own words should be con sidered licit or not from the point of view of the sacred law was not clear for the early Muslims.

Brigaglia I Die Welt des i dams 49 (2009) 334-366 All the same, written tafs?r had also experienced some original devel opments in West Africa, the most important being the works of the Nigerian Abd Allah Dan Fodio (d. 1829). The junior brother of the Q?dir? shaykh and leader of the Fulaniy//^cUthman Dan Fodio had to his credit a rich encyclopaedic exegesis (Diya at-ta'wil) which was based on an extensive range of classical sources of the genre; a summa rized one, Kif?yat du afa as-S?d?n meant at popularizing the essentials of the exegetical tradition for a wider public; and a didactic poem for students, Mifi?h at-tafs?r. Mauritanians had also their own record of works on tafs?r, the most important being the Sufi exegesis of Muham mad b. al-Mukht?r al-Yad?l? (d. 1753) of the Sh?dhiliyya order.25 In Nigeria, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Borno was unanimously considered as the most renowned place for the study of tafs?r. Some schools, however, existed in Kano too. As was the case for most of the disciplines of the higher Islamic curriculum, the teaching of exegesis was provided in the vestibule (in Hausa soro, or zaure) of the teacher s house. While basic Qur'?nic education was provided ubiquit ously through the omnipresent Qur'anic schools, some kind of a clanic arrangement presided over the supply of advanced disciplinary training in the ilimi (from Ar. Him) schools. The teaching of each major disci pline was concentrated in the houses of specialists of the subject, and kept under the supervision of a particular scholarly family. Elder members taught the major books to junior or aspirant m?lams (from Ar. mu allim), while part of the secondary teaching activity was delegated to the advanced students who attended the dwelling. The term 'school' (makaranta) designated either the house of an influential scholar, or a network of neighbouring houses under the control of a leading family specialized in the teaching of a discipline, sometimes even of a single book along with its commentaries. This does not mean that teachers did not know and consult wider sources for their fatwds. But they usually refrained from teaching books other than core traditional sources. This system guaranteed the uniform transmission of a solid 25) See Leconte, R: Une ex?g?se [sic] mystique du Coran au XVIIIeme si?cle [sic] dans le Sud Ouest de la Mauritanie (al-Gibla): ad-Dahab [sic] al-Ibr?z fi Tafsir Kit?b All?h al-Az?z de Muhammad ihn al-Muht?r al-Yad?l?

Yet, a certain degree of flexibility was allowed in the system: the importance attached to oral comments permitted the development of local bodies of knowledge around the basic texts, while the practice of free curricular choice and the absence of centralized institutions implementing an educational policy from above ensured that the teaching provided was, at the end of the day, the result of an informal negotiation between the offer (transmitted bodies of knowledge) and the demand of students, that could be partly influenced by changing circumstances. The Kano scholarly community was permeated with a network of relations founded on reciprocal need: no family could claim universal pre-eminence in all fields of knowledge, and students had to be sent from one school to another if they wanted to diversify their curriculum. This reduced the risk of competition between scholarly networks. One may wonder if this system was not, to a certain degree, a product of the strict Fulani etiquette of shyness, dignified avoidance and self-restraint (pulaako), combined with the need for maintaining a certain level of cohesion among the scholarly class. According to a tacit agreement which provided the foundation of the town scholars' etiquette, a mdlam who had been formed into one of the major scholarly families was not expected to teach any book except the ones he had been explicitly entrusted with by his mentors, even when he had the skill to do so. Should students come to him from abroad asking for knowledge outside of his strict competence, he was supposed to send them to the 'right' family. Teaching a discipline out of one's own competence was looked upon as interfering with somebody else's affairs. It was only at the time of the Emir Abdull?hi Bayero26 that tafsirs multiplied in Kano. Before that time, only three or four m?lams performed tafsir in the whole city. This was because those who learned tafsir would not teach it, out of respect for the place where they had been trained in the discipline. Even if you asked them, they would not teach you tafsir. Rather, they would address 26) Reigned 1927-53. As it was mentioned above, Emir Abdull?hi was one of the major brains behind the fayda tij?niyya transition in Kano.</page><page sequence="15">348 A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des islams 49 (2009) 334-366 you to their own master, or to the latter's sons. They would not dare teaching it themselves.27 It is difficult of course to rate how far this system did effectively work in Kano in the nineteenth century. Its somewhat idealized memory, however, is still strong within the scholarly families which hitherto controlled these networks of learning, as the Jar Kasa tafs?r school, to which M?lam Muhammad al-Gh?l?, author of the above statement, belongs.28 Today, marginalized by the transformation of the whole system, the heads of the older schools tend to speak with some nostalgia of a golden age' based on an inflexible code of reciprocal respect (and avoidance) among scholars. The Jar Kasa School of tafs?r At the beginning of the twentieth century, Kano was reputed mainly for the study of M?lik? jurisprudence, which was the monopoly of a scholarly clan based in Madabo ward, in the Northwestern section of the walled city. The study of advanced fiqh there was usually restricted to Khal?l b. Ish?q's Mukhtasar and to its commentaries. The teaching of the Mukhtasar at Madabo and in Kano had been seemingly founded in the early nineteenth century by a scholar coming from Katsina.29 The scholars who controlled the teaching of M?lik? law in Madabo were collectively referred to as the madab?w?y and constituted the main 'scholarly corporation' in Kano. Other (house or clan-based) schools existed that were known for the teaching of hadlth and sira. At that time, the city was not renowned for the study of tafs?r. The most sought after teachers for all the Qur'?nic subjects (memorization, 27) M?lam Muhammad al-Gh?l?, interview (Kano, 2 Sept. 2005). 28) My main source on the history of the Jar ICasa school is a series of interviews with M?lam Muhammad al-Gh?l?, with his brother cAbd al-Wahh?b b.

Oral tafs?r, however, was performed in Kano during the month of Ramadan at the Emirs Palace. More importantly, tafs?r was taught on a regular basis by some scholars, the most renowned being those attached to a house in the ward of'Jar Kasa ('red soif). Jar Kasa is the older Hausa name of a neighbourhood located west of the central mosque and the Emir's palace, otherwise known as 'Kabara', from the village of origin of the Timbuktu scholar cUmar al-Kabar?, who, after moving from Kabara near Timbuktu, had settled in Kano at the time of cUthm?n Dan Fodio's jihdd and established a center of Islamic learning in the city. According to the local tradition, another scholar and a contemporary of cUmar al-Kabar?, Ali b. Abd Allah, had also come to Kano from the West, the Songhay speaking town of Gao in today's Eastern Mali. M?lam All settled in the area, founded a school of tafs?r, and when Shaykh cUthm?n Dan Fodio's army conquered Kano he was appointed as the town's chief Qur'?nic recitor', amir al-qurr?'?? The original building of the school has undergone several restorations, but still exists in its original struc ture. Its size and its location, in the heart of Kabara ward, confirm the claims made in the family's foundation history about the leading posi tion that M?lam Al? was accorded within the town's scholarly circles. Rather than with the name of the founder Al? of Gao, however, the Jar Kasa school of tafs?r is known today as makarantar M?lam Shamsu, by the name of M?lam Shams ad-D?n (d. about 1947), who, among Alfs direct descendants, is the one who has contributed the greatest to the school's fame. His complete name was Muhammad Shams ad-D?n b. Muhammad al-Madan?. He was born around 1871, and was a great grandson of M?lam Al?, and the fourth in the line of his successors at the head of the school. His activity flourished in the same years as Muhammad Saiga, an era of profound transformation of Kano's reli gious culture. He may also have played some role in the events which led to the boom of the salg?w? network, for he was a teacher to some 30) Interviews with M?lam Muhammad al-Gh?l?

The development of the salg?w? network, however, would ultimately set off a decline of the Jar Kasa school of tafs?r together with that of other older networks. M?lam Shamsu is not reported to have introduced any significant innovation in the content of the teaching of tafs?r, which was restricted among the Jar Kasa m?lams to the Jal?layn, nor in its technique. His achievements are assessed by his successors only in terms of quantity, the number of the students enrolled under his tutorage reaching extra ordinary peaks particularly during the years 1930s-1940s, and of the regional extent of his network of students. The reason beyond this success reputedly lied only in his personal charisma due to an extra ordinary taqw? (piety). M?lam Shamsu's grandchildren, who are the present principals of the Jar Kasa school, point to the growth of a regional network of students out of Kano town as the most significant development peculiar to M?lam Shamsu's time, but stress that no change was made in the ways the Jal?layn was taught. M?lam Shamsu is remembered also for being the first of the Jar Kasa house m?lams to affiliate to the Tij?niyya tar?qa, after a dream he made of the order's founder. The teaching of the Jal?layn at the Jar Kasa school was greatly in vogue in the 1940s. Several well-known scholars of Kano, and some prominent figures who had an important role in the successive developments of the town's religious life, such as Y?suf Makwarari, who was the main deputy of the Q?diriyya leader M?lam N?sir Kabara, and M?lam 'Shehu' Mai Hula, who would become one of the leading promoters of the fayda tij?niyya, were introduced to the study of tafs?r by M?lam Shamsu. Before M?lam Shamsu's time, most of the tafs?r scholars living in neighboring towns and formed at Jar Kasa would not establish schools of tafs?r of their own, but would always insist on sending their own students to Jar Kasa in Kano. Decentralization, on the contrary, would become a hallmark of the salg?w?, and would contribute to their success in establishing wider?though somewhat less homogenous?networks. 31) As a form of respect for Shaykh 'Uthm?n 'Dan Fodio, all those who carry the name Uthm?n are simply addressed as Shehu (shaykh) in the Fulani scholarly circles of Northern Nigeria.</page><page sequence="18">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 351 The fact that the authority on which they depended was an external one (Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse, based in Senegal) was a major factor that helped the salg?w? to emancipate themselves from the strict patterns of authority of Kano elderly scholarly class, and produce an indepen dent, multi-centric scholarly network. Today, the teaching of the Jal?layn is still performed at the Jar Kasa school, reportedly identically to the way it was in the 1930s. About twenty senior students attend the Jal?layn class of M?lam Muhammad al-Gh?l? (M?lam Shamsu's grandson). It is still a significant number, but not if compared to the golden age of M?lam Shamsu, when students attending advanced tafs?r training at any given time reportedly exceeded a hundred. The teaching of tafs?r is run every day (except Thursdays and Fridays) in the morning. A normal teaching session starts at about 7-30 am, and continues until about 11 am. Though the rhythm is, consistently with the standards of traditional Islamic higher teaching, a quiet one to allow concentration, there is no break and the work can be indeed a very demanding one for the teacher. Only one senior m?lam is allowed to teach tafs?r at each generation, and he will hold the title of mai tafsiri (chief-exegete). With the authorization to teach the Jal? layn to students, at each generation the mai tafsiri inherits the direction of the whole school activities. On the whole, the organism of the Jar Kasa school is clearly grown out of the imperative of guaranteeing the greatest uniformity of trans mission. Techniques and content of the teaching routine, but also the rules governing the transmission of the position of chief mai tafsiri are oriented towards a conservative goal. The only matter taught in the school, as far as tafs?r is concerned, is the Jal?layn, and students learn a very accurate translation of the book into Hausa. Though scholars may read other tafsirs on their own, none of the more voluminous books of tafs?r is allowed to penetrate into the curricular offer of this school. This is not perceived as a limit by the Jar Kasa tafs?r scholars. As the emphasis is entirely placed upon soundness and uniformity of transmission, the introduction of new books is dis couraged because it may open the door to innovation and to deviation from accepted patterns of interpretation. From the time of the founder to the present principal of the Jar Kasa school, the position of mai tafsiri has been always transmitted according</page><page sequence="19">352 A. Brigaglia / Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 to a strict hereditary pattern. The designated successor undergoes a rigorous training, by acting for a number of years as the mai jan ba? {Jal?layn text-reader) of his father or senior brother, until the death or retirement of the latter. In this way, memorization of the oral text (the translation in Hausa performed by the mai tafsiri) is facilitated along with that of the written one (the Arabic Jal?layn read when acting as a mai jan ba?), and the uniformity of the oral transmission is better preserved. The Emergence of the salg?w? According to M?lam Muhammad al-Gh?li, in the late 1930s, when the older tradition of taf sir teaching at Jar Kasa was reaching its peak under M?lam Shamsu s headship, there were only about three or four locations in Kano where public sessions of Ramad?n tafsir were performed. In the early 1960s on the other hand, according to another local source, the number of public Ramad?n tafsir m town could be ranged at about fifty.32 This dramatic increase in the popularity of public tafsir was the result of the efforts of the scholars who, following Ibr?h?m Niasse, rallied under the banner of the fay da tij?niyya. The salg?w? network, in particular, was the main responsible for popularization of tafsir, and, at the same time, of the Tij?n? 'flood' in Kano. Muhammad Saiga (d. 1938) was the imam of the first Tij?n? z?wiya in Kano, founded by al-Aiam? in the 1920s, and most of his students were affiliated with the Tij?niyya. Their scholarly activities in the 1930s, however, had focused mainly on the interpretation of M?lik? law. Though Sufism was practiced actively and the Tij?n? identity was already distinctive of the network, Sufi knowledge was not an issue of intel lectual exercise. Muhammad Saiga had risen to public notoriety when he had attacked the rituals of the burial and the prayer for the dead, as they were practiced and taught by the scholars of Madabo (madab?w?) 32) M?lam Muhammad Kani, interview (Kano: 1 \ Sept. 2005). This number is limited to what may be classified as 'scholarly' tafsirs, and does not include more popular genres, like the sessions of dramatized tafs?r based on the Qur'?nic stories of the prophets (qissa) that itinerant m?lams/stoty-teWcts improvise at public places (markets, bus stations). The accuracy of the number mentioned by M?lam Muhammad Kani is difficult to assess. Today the number of public tafsirs in Kano is no doubt well above fifty.</page><page sequence="20">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 353 with whom he had previously studied, condemning them as unlawful bida (innovations).33 A significant body of polemical legal literature was produced in the 1930s by the salg?w? and madab?w? scholars on the issue of the burial rites. The salg?w? showed to be particularly resourceful writers of doctrinal literature. Muhammad Saiga, in fact, had encouraged his students to engage in the deep study of Arabic grammar, to which scarce emphasis was hitherto given in the Kano traditional curricula. More generally, he had tried to provide them with a more multi-disciplinary approach to Islamic knowledge than the one provided by the Madabo tradition, focused only on Law. In the latter field, moreover, he had introduced some commentaries to the Mukh tasar of Khalll b. Ish?q that were not used by the Madabo scholars. In such a way, he had pushed his students to detour the monopoly that the madab?w? scholars exerted on the town's legal studies, and encouraged them to be more receptive to change. His students were provided with a new multidisciplinary synthesis of the traditional curriculum, and their study of other disciplines such as sira, hadith, grammar and tafsir was to influence their understanding of the legal corpus. The salg?w? were also keen to expand their intellectual activities beyond the narrow confines of Kano s clan-based and mono-disciplinary schools. After the death of their master, and probably under the inspiration, if not the direct encouragement, of Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse, tafsir would naturally become the arena wherein the salg?w? scholars would be able to display, transmit and reproduce their new approach to knowledge. As it has already been remarked above, in the local arrangement of Islamic knowledge tafsir was the only disciplinary field which allowed, for the few who had reached it, a relative disentanglement from the strict rules of taqlid ('imitation'; abiding by the principle of scholastic authority) which governed other field. Saiga's pupils would also start performing public sessions of tafsir in Hausa independently from existing networks like that of the Jar Kasa school, thus favouring the formation of a wider space for the circulation of religious knowledge than was permitted by customary allotments. 33) On Muhammad Saiga and the salg?w?, see Paden: Religion and Political Culture, 90-94, 99-104.</page><page sequence="21">354 A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 It is probably upon a suggestion from Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse that the salg?w? scholars began to organize ubiquitously in Kano public sessions of tafsir in Hausa during the month of Ramadan. What is certain, at least, is that they started to do so only in the early 1950s, after a first group of them had undergone a period of study in Kaolack with the Senegalese Sufi. Interestingly, tafsir had already played a decisive role in the earlier career of Ibr?h?m Niasse. In the late 1920s, about one year before his public claim of the fay da (1929), the Senegalese had established an independent public teaching of tafsir in the village of Kosi, near the town of Kaolack in Senegal. The establishment of his oral tafsir perfor mance had also triggered a quarrel with his senior brother and khalifa of their father, Muhammad.34 Notwithstanding the young age of the scholar (he was then in his twenties), the tafsir of Ibrahim Niasse quickly became a pole of attraction for the group of Senegalese and Mauritanian followers that would become the first nucleus of the people of the flood'. Apart from the Jal?layny the main sources of the Senegalese in the field of tafsir, judging from the quotations in some of his writings35 and 34) The story has it that Muhammad Khalifa prevented his brother from having access to a copy of a manuscript of the Tafsir al-jal?layn that had belonged to their father, which Ibrahim wanted to use during his tafsir reading. Ibrahim insisted that he had not to stop his reading, and began and independent teaching, quoting from memory whenever neces sary. Students started gathering around Ibrahim, and Muhammad Khalifa decided to sent his brothers Muhammad Zaynab and 'Uthman to listen to their cadet brother's tafsir and report back about it. Apparently they said: 'What he is teaching, if our father knew it, he kept it secret. What Ibrahim is teaching now is not found in any books' (interview with Shaykh Hasan Cisse, New York: June 2007; I am also thankful to Zachary Wright and to Shaykh Tij?n? Cisse for their comments). Muhammad Niasse was also a prolific author of prose and of compelling religious verses. One of his prose works has been discussed in Kane, O.: "Muhammad Niasse (1881-1956) et sa r?plique contre le pamphlet anti-tijan? de Ibn Mayaba", in: D. Robinson &amp; J.-L- Triaud (eds.), Le temps des marabouts. A d?w?n of his in praise of the Prophet, and another in praise of Shaykh Ahmad al-Tij?ni are preserved in the collection of Arabic manuscripts of the Herskovits Library, Northwestern University, Evanston (respectively, No. Hunwick/492/PE and Hunwick/493/PE). Several of the many works by Ibrahim Niasse can also be consulted in the same collection. 35) For instance, in K?shifal-ilb?s (Niasse, L: K?shifal-ilb?s (an faydat al-khatm Abi al-Abb?s, Cairo 2001) and al-Hujja al-b?ligha (pubi.

Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 355 from the manuscripts in his personal library,36 were the following: 1) the Sufi tafsir of the Mauritanian al-Yad?l? (d. 1753); 2) that of the Turkish Ism?'?l Haqq? (d. 1725); 3) the commentary on the Jal?layn by the Egyptian M?lik? jurist and Khalwat? Sufi Ahmad as-S?w? (d. 1825). His audience, however, particularly appreciated the moments when?thus has it the account of the Nigerian T?hir Baud?taken off his glasses and laid down the book', he left room for his additional comments, enriched with quotations from classical Sufi literature (the Moroccan Ahmad Zarr?q and the Egyptian Ibn Ata Allah).37 Shaykh Ibrahim's exegesis was punctuated with metaphysical and cosmological themes. Reference was often made to the symbolic archi tecture of the Qur'an, through references to the doctrine of numbers. The underlying idea was that God's creation is disseminated with marks linking mundane and ultra-mundane realities, encoded in numbers of which the Qur'an is the ultimate key. A central place is reserved in particular to the number 5, the cipher of the created worlds, which rests at the heart of a set of analogies explored by a number of Sufis well before the Senegalese scholar. In the realm of macrocosmic reality number 5 corresponds to the five presences' (hadardt) or strati fied realms of cosmic existence, that provide the architecture for the flood of spiritual knowledge to the disciple as it is conceptualized in the process of tarbiya (Sufi training). In the microcosmic realm it corresponds to the five organs of knowledge: nafs or individual soul, 36) The catalogue of the manuscripts of Shaykh Ibrahim's library has been published by Ousmane Kane {Fihris makht?t?t maktabat ash-shaykh M?r Mbdy S?s? wa-maktabat al-H?jj Malik Si wa-maktabat ash-shaykh Ibrahim Niy?s fi Sinigh?l, London: Al-Furq?n Islamic Heritage Foundation, 1997). 37) M?lam T?hir Bauci (interview, Kaduna: October 2002). Some old tapes of Ibrahim Niasse' Arabic tafsir still circulate in Nigeria, and some attempts have also been made at putting them into writing for publishing. Notes from a public tafsir performed by the Senegalese in the month of Sha'b?n 1375 (March-April 1956), presumably during a visit in Nigeria, have been published at the initiative of 'Uthm?n al-Fall?ti, one of the leaders of the Tij?niyya in Nguru (today's Yobe State, Northeastern Nigeria). The collection, published with the title al-Hikam al-qutbiyya al-ma'kh?dha min al-qalam al-sirinbiyya, is about 19 pages long, and includes sections on the esoteric commentary of the Fdtiha, of S?rat al-Ikhlds, al-Falaq and al-Nds. It is also followed by an interesting mystical dialogue that occurred between the Senegalese and his 'innermost self {'an sirri), who was reporting from my Lord {'an rabbi)'.</page><page sequence="23">356 A. Brigaglia /Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 which perceives through the physical senses; (aql or logical intellect, which elaborates the data of senses into notions; qalb or heart, which illuminates analogies; r?h or spiritual self, which perceives authentic visions; sirr or innermost Self (the abode where perception, perceiving subject and perceived object are but one thing). To these meanings allude, in reversed order, the five Names of God mentioned in the F?tiha: All?h (the Name of the Essence) presides over the human sirr; ar-Rabb (Breeder) is the Name presiding over the human r?h; ar-Rahm?n (All-Merciful) is the Name presiding over the human qalb; ar-Rahim (Compassionate) is the Name presiding over the human (aql; al-Malik (King) is the Name presiding over the human nafs. These Names, on their turn, correspond to the fundamental rulings of the sacred Law {sharia), enclosed in the five pillars {ark?n) of Islam as the last revealed religion: the shah?da (testifying that there is no other God than Allah, and that Muhammad is his messenger, the sal?t (ritual prayer), the siy?m (fast of Ramadan), the zak?t (obligatory alms), the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca).38 The audience was left with a vivid feeling of the unity underlying existing entities, but at the same time supplied with a coherent theological view of the implications of the miraculous nature of the Qur'?n, and persuaded to adhere firmly to the legal aspects of religion. The latter aspect was undoubtedly a major ingredient of the success of Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse' tafs?r among the Nigerian group of the salg?w?, who were primarily students of Law trying to implement locally an agenda of reform. It is primarily through his tafsir that the Senegalese could bond exterior and interior aspects of the revelation in a coherent whole: the sacred text endorsed the pursuit of gnosis {ma'rifa), by pointing to the fundamental unity of all existing realities; gnosis, by unveiling the secrets of the acts of worship and of the architecture of 'formal' religion, reinforced the audience's commitment to the law established by the sacred text. 38) The correspondence between the five of God mentioned in the Fdtiha and the five pillars of Islam is a favorite theme in the tafsir of most of Ibrahim Niasses students in Nigeria. See for instance the tafsir of Shaykh T?hir cUthm?n Bauci briefly described in Brigaglia: "The Radio Kaduna Tafsir (1978-1992)".</page><page sequence="24">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 357 The intellectual aspirations that had been nurtured by the salg?w? in the local context of Kano found also a powerful parallel, on the spiritual domain, in Niasses characteristic Sufi doctrine of the fayda tij?niyya. The latter's suggestion of the possibility of a transforming, instant effusion (fayd) of gnosis (ma'rifa), of a generous facilitation of spiritual training (tarbiya), of a liberating, abundant series of breathings (nafahdt) following a time of contraction (diq), resonated as an answer to the salgdwas aspiration to a freer circulation of Islamic knowledge in Kano city. At the same time, the encounter with Ibrahim Niasse would produce among the salgdwd a shift in the overall emphasis of their intellectual revival from Law to Sufism. The young salgdwd scholars (Tij?nl cUthman and Muhammad ath-Th?nl K?fangh?) who had written in support of Muhammad Saigas condemnation of the burial practices, had shown in their earlier writings a rather intransigent standing, and in their zeal towards change of local practices they had developed a harsh concept of bidca, somehow anticipating the attitudes of later, and much more radical, reformist movements of Salali or Wahh?b? inspiration.39 By having their focus on Sufism reinforced through Niasse s influence, the salgdwd scholars experienced a funda mental re-orientation. In the 1970s, it will be from the fayda tij?niyya scholars that the most formidable opponents of Wahh?b?-oriented reformism in Nigeria will stem. The impact of the salgdwd-fayda network in the history of Kano tafsir tradition is to be appreciated not only in terms of the diffusion and popularization of public exegesis, but also of the introduction of a wider range of sources in the scholarly tradition, of innovative elements in the performance of public exegesis, and of a more versatile approach to Islamic knowledge. Diversification of Sources The sources of the salg?wd/fayda tij?niyya authors were partially stem ming from Niasses input, combined with their earlier formation at the 39) For details on the arguments put forward during the madab?w? vs. salg?w? polemics, see Anwar: Struggle for Influence and Identity, 42-57.</page><page sequence="25">358 A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 hand of Muhammad Saiga. Characteristic sources of this group of exegetes soon became the following: the already mentioned H?shiya cal? al-jal?layn by Ahmad b. as-S?w? and Ruh al-bay?n by Ism?'?l Haqq? al-Bursaw?, and Z?dal-mas?rfi Him at-tafs?r by Ibn al-Jawz? (d. 1200).40 The use of S?w?'s supra-commentary to the Jal?layn was probably encouraged by the fact that it offered an uncompromising rejoin to the spread of Wahh?b? anti-Sufi doctrines. The introduction of this text in the Malian curricula of tafsir has also been reported as a relatively recent addition.41 This tafsir contained a passage in which Wahh?bism was equated with Kh?rijism (commentary to verse XXXV: 6: 'The devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy. He only summons his faction to be prey of the flaming Fire'), which has been reportedly censored from more recent editions of the book.42 Its introduction in the curricula of the Nigerian scholars, while reinforcing their commit ment to the collective scholarly heritage encompassed in the Jal?layn, confirmed that Sufism was an integral part of the same heritage, and provided them with an authoritative polemical precedent against Wahh?bism. As for Jawz?'s, it is a theological tafsir, containing amongst other things a strong denunciation of the anthropomorphic doctrines (tashbih) of some of the author's contemporaries. The debate over the interpretation of the Qur'?nic verses mentioning attributes of God as the Hand', the Face', and his 'settling on the Throne', will also become a topos of the Nigerian polemical tafsirs, with Sufi/Ashcari scholars accusing their Salaf?/Wahh?b? counterparts of upholding anthropo morphic ideas. In this perspective, the exegesis of Jawz?, who was a strict Hanbal? critical of some of his Sufi contemporaries, was instrumental to oppose the anti-Ashcar? dimension of the reformists' tafsir. As for Haqq?'s, his comments on Ibn Arab?'s doctrine and his quotes from classical mystical poets?endorsed and transmitted by Ibr?h?m Niasse? provided the salg?w?s exegesis with an explicit Sufic input. 40) These considerations are based on a series of interviews I had with a number of fayda tij?niyya Kano scholars during the years 2002 to 2005. In particular, I wish to mention and thank the following: M?lam Bashir Buh?ri al-R?mi, M?lam Ism?'il Khalifa, M?lam Muhammad Kani Gusau, M?lam Ruf?ci Abu Bakr Na-W?li. 41) Tamari: Islamic Higher Education, 108. 42) http://www.masudxoMklISIAMInuhlmasudq3.htm (last consulted 13/03/2009).</page><page sequence="26">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 359 Taken as a whole, these three sources provide a highly organic approach to Muslim exegesis under its classical tripartite articulation, with S?w? featuring as a mamlyfiqh? (legal) tafs?r, Jawz? as a theological one, and Haqq? as a Sufi or mystical one. On the whole, the salg?w?/ fayda scholars' ambition was to refresh the local scholarly tradition and enhance its dynamism, rather than to revise its fundamental tenets. The three texts mentioned, however, though they enjoyed greater diffusion than others, can not be considered as the sole sources of Nigerian modern tafs?r. This is especially true in the case of the salg?w? scholars, more than in the case of their counterparts formed at earlier traditions. The Jal?layn and S?w? remain the most common muqarrar texts (texts read through the oral performance, providing the basis for the author's additional comments), but many other texts are consulted and occasionally quoted by the authors of oral communal tafs?r, from the exegesis of the local father of Nigerian tafs?r cAbd Allah T)an Fodio to standard classical sources such as at-Tabari (d. 923), Ibn Kath?r (d. 1373), as-Suy?t? (d. 1505), al-Jamal (d. 1789), al-Qurtubi (d. 1272), al-Bayd?w? (d. 1286), al-KMzin (d. 1341), an-Nasaf? (d. 1310), ar-R?z? (d. 1209) and az-Zamakhshar? (d. 1144). Stylistic Innovation Ahmad at-Tij?n? b. cUthm?n al-Kanaw? (d. 1970), popularly known as M?lam Tij?n? cUthm?n Zang?n Barebari, was a leading representative of the fayda tij?niyya in Kano, one of the first to engage in public tafs?r, and the most audacious in innovating its practice in Kano.43 His earlier formation was entirely local. He had studied Law and Linguistics with Muhammad Saiga, and Sufism with Ab? Bakr Mijinyawa.44 He had also studied tafs?r with M?lam S?n? (i.e. Muhammad ath-Th?n?) of Shatsari ward, the other leading place for the study of the discipline in Kano in the early twentieth century, side by side the Jar Kasa school. In the 1930s, he had set a school of his own, where he was teaching 43) Tij?n? cUthm?n has also written some works. For a list, see Hunwick: Arabic Literature of Africa, vol. I, 284-86. 44) Abu Bakr, I.: Lamha 'an tarjamat ash-Shaykh Ahmadat-Tijdni bin 'Uthman, unpublished paper (Kano: no date, library of Shaykh Isma'il Khalifa), 2.</page><page sequence="27">360 A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 primarily M?lik? Law. M?lam Tij?n? cUthm?n belonged to first group of Kano scholars that travelled to Kaolack to undergo training at the hands of Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse. Upon his return he started to organize annual public activities (night gatherings based on dhikr and reading of poetry during the month of Rab? al-Awwal, the month of the Prophet's birthday; sessions of public Qur'anic exegesis during the early afternoons of the month of Ramadan) that transformed his school into the most popular venue of Kano collective devotional life during through the 1950s and 1960s.45 Tij?n? cUthm?n started performing his public tafs?r at the mosque of Zang?n Barebari ward, which was located in the daedalus of narrow roads of the birni, east of Kano central market, but had a small open place [dandalt) in the front. As it was customary, Tij?n? cUthm?n would sit on a mat or on a goat skin (buzu) inside the mosque, facing the audience sitting in front of him. For chose who could not find room inside, additional mats would be spread out of the small mosque. After a few years, when the people attending tafs?r increased dramatically, he decided to move a few hundred meters further, to the larger paved street where his native house was located, close to Gab ari corner, adjacent the city central market. To meet the logistic needs of this new arrangement, he introduced the habit of sitting upon a wooden platform, making his figure visible even from afar in the crowded street. An organizing committee had also to be established, to ensure that the increasingly demanding practical aspects of the organization be carried out effi ciently. Later, also a loudspeaker was added, which enabled not only men attending, but also women of the surrounding neighbourhood to listen from the courtyards of houses. The change from sitting on a goat skin to a small podium, and the introduction of a loudspeaker, were very significant at that time, as they concretely marked the transformation of tafs?r in Kano from a discipline of indoor learning to a public expression of scholarly talents. Tij?n? 45) For a description of such mawlid gatherings at the house of M?lam Tij?n? cUthm?n, see Paden: Religion and Political Culture, 124f. My reconstruction of his tafs?r includes data collected during interviews with M?lam Ism?'?l Khalifa, and others provided by people of the area's neighborhood, together with further comments during conversations with other members of the town's scholarly class.</page><page sequence="28">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 361 cUthm?n was accompanied, canonically, by a mai jan Aya who read the Qur'an. Aside the mai jan Aya, three or four of his students also sat, each of them holding a particular book. Tij?n?'s favorite sources were as-S?w?, al-Jamal (an Egyptian and one of S?w?'s teachers, author of another commentary on the Jal?layn), al-Kh?zin (a fourteenth century theological exegesis) and Ism?'?l Haqq?. When he wanted to quote from a relevant commentary, Tij?n? cUthm?n would summon the correspondent student by saying, for instance: 'mai Sawi, wuri kazal" ('holder of S?w?'s tafs?r, [read] the given passage'). The presence of different readers with several books displayed the assorted background of the salg?w? legacy, and the agility of the exegete in calling' quotations from them at the right moment showed to the public the novelty of their approach to knowledge. The Qur'?n and Traditional Bodies of Knowledge Tij?n? cUthm?n's tafs?r was performed at a very fast pace (one hizb, a sixtieth of the Qur'an, per day). The author, however, found the time to address several themes, and occasionally to mention differences of opinion between the four legal schools concerning particular aspects of religious practice (though preference would finally be given to the positions of the M?lik? school).46 This was a legacy of the eclectic formation of the salg?w?, and showed their ambition of popularizing and expanding (not challenging in its basic tenets) traditional religious knowledge. In most other networks of Kano, it was only customary in public teaching to take the standard M?lik? position as fixed in the Mukhtasar of Khal?l b. Ish?q for granted: digressions that would take into consideration differences of opinion were reserved to senior scho larly gatherings or writing, and they were considered as irrelevant to what a basic public tafs?r was supposed to offer to the populace. The tafs?r of Tij?n? cUthm?n changed radically the concept of what con stitutes Islamic knowledge of public' concern. 46) I have been able to listen to about five old tapes of Tij?n? 'Uthm?n's tafs?r, purchased in Kano.</page><page sequence="29">362 A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 Short inner interpretations {ta'wil) were also often provided after linguistic, legal and historic considerations had been explored in a rapid sequence. A crucial point that the fay da tijdniyya generally tries to convey with insistence is the realization that God's Being ultimately absorbs all entities. Thus, the ta'wilo?the istV?dha (the formula: 'I take refuge in God from Satan, the accursed one'), is pointed at as being contained in the famous prayer transmitted by the Prophet: 'I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your pardon from Your punishment, and in You from You'. Similarly, the ta'wil of the Basmala (the formula 'In the Name of God, the Beneficent, the most Merci ful')?according to a Sufi tradition mentioned byTij?n? cUthm?n that would become a topos of the later fayda tijdniyya scholars' tafsir?is hidden in its first letter, the locative particle bi- ('in'), and is to be explained as follows: 'Within Me {bi) was all that was, and within Me {bi) will be whatever will be; the true being of the world is within Me, and the world has not a real existence, except in a nominal and meta phorical way'. These would become a topos introduction to the exegesis of the Fdtiha by the fayda scholars. On the whole, M?lam Tij?n? cUthm?n's tafsir took Islamic knowl edge, its reference texts and its concept s out of the sow (private vestibule) of Kano scholars, infused them with an explicit Sufi connotation and made them a popular thing and object of discussion in the city. The idea that Islamic knowledge constitutes a coherent body whose ultimate sense lies in ma'rifa (gnosis) is powerfully expressed in the set of analo gies upon which he builds his tafsir of the Fdtiha. This fragment can be considered as emblematic of the role he (and his fellow scholars of the salgdwdlfayda tijdniyya network) played in Kano at the half of the twentieth century, through the combination of M?lam Muhammad Saiga's multi-disciplinary approach to (ul?m with Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse' encompassing emphasis on macrifa. The basic scheme (the idea of the 9 fields of Qur'anic knowledge contained in the Fdtiha) is taken from Ibrahim Niasses own tafsir, with some additional elaborations (for example: the distinction between 'utensils' and 'fruits' of knowl edge).47 47) 'Uthm?n, T.: Tafs?r S?rat al-F?tiha (undated recording), and Niasse, I.: Tafs?r S?rat al-F?tiha (undated recording).</page><page sequence="30">A. Brigaglia I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 363 The author starts by reminding a classical definition of the Qur'an as the matrix of all sciences' (umm al-ul?m). Sciences have?he con tinues?ancillary disciplines or technical utensils' {k?yan aik?): lugha (lexicography), nahiv (syntax), i^n/(morphology), bal?gha (rhetoric), mantiq (logic), usui (principles of Law), mustalah {hadith taxonomy). They also have their fruits (cyd(ya), which are the objects of knowledge, the things which are known. Since it produces fruits, the Qur'an can be considered also as their seed (in). The author does not comment further on this point, but it is worthy noting that he defines the Qur'an first as the 'feminine' principle of knowledge ('the matrix [lit.: the mother] of all sciences') and then as a 'masculine' one ('the seed of all objects of knowledge'). The 'fruits'?continues M?lam Tij?n??are of nine species, which correspond to the nine fields (fun?n) of sacred knowledge. These dis ciplinary fields are contained in the nine main phrases of the F?tiha, according to the following scheme: Qur'?nic verse or expression 1 al-hamdu li-l l?hi Translation All praise belongs to God Corresponding knowledge ('fruit') Praise.

The 'fruits' correspond more or less to the different categories of knowledge as they were classified by classical scholars. Interestingly, field 1 (the science of'the Praise') is not</page><page sequence="32">A.

As the phrase al-Hamdu lil-L?h is the principle of the Qur'an, this knowledge is the ineffable principle of all sacred knowledge. Conclusion: Learning, Gnosis, Scholarly Expansion In older, conservative networks of Kano as the Jar Kasa school of tafs?r, scholarly sources were strictly scrutinized and rules of succession closely monitored through a hereditary pattern rules of succession. Higher forms of knowledge as encompassed in the transmitted tafs?r corpus were taken extremely seriously and their pursuit encouraged, but new sources were looked upon as irrelevant and redundant. The teaching method was carefully tested but stereotyped, and the relations with other networks were founded upon an attitude of prudence. On the whole, expansion was not encouraged, and students were satisfied with receiving from the study of tafs?r the blessing that would enhance their scholarly prestige. The fayda tij?niyya network, on the contrary, was moved by an aspiration to a wider intellectual freedom that would turn quickly into an expansionist drive. Many of the scholars formed at the hands of the first group of fayda tij?niyya scholars in Kano were given ij?z?t and encouraged to start independent teachings and public Ramad?n tafs?r at their home-base. In a couple of decades, the tafs?r network of Tij?n? cUthm?n extended through most of the Hausa speaking areas of Northern Nigeria, and likewise through the Middle Belt, Yorubaland, Adamawa, the Cameroon, the Central African Republic and the Republic of Niger. This network included at least a dozen of major scholars whose schools became on their turn the centers</page><page sequence="33">366 A. Brigaglia / Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 334-366 of local networks of a certain significance (one example is M?lam cAbd ar-Razz?q of Magarla, who became one of the leading scholars in Niger). Most of Tij?n? cUthm?n's students died in the 1990s, but their sub networks have maintained the link with Tij?n? cUthm?n's school. Suc cession to Tij?n? cUthm?n's school has not followed a dynastic pattern, and after his sudden death in a car accident in 1970, the school has been directed by his student lsm?c?l Ibr?h?m Khal?fa. Most of the scholars formed at the school in Zang?n Barebari have continued to maintain the link with it after the death of its founder, but cultivate also their own independent connections with the larger Nigerian scholarly community, and with international centers of the Tij?niyya brotherhood like Fez (Morocco) and Kaolack (Senegal). The combination between their reformist approach to legal studies and their stress on Sufi knowledge infused with a missionary drive gave the salg?w? a unique propelling force and turned them into the most successful scholarly network of twentieth century's Nigerian Islam. Their new synthesis provided them with the ability of arousing a longing for gnosis through learning, and a longing for learning through gnosis, thereby cyclically reproducing the group's self-confidence. The network's structure of scholarly and spiritual authority formed along a multi centric pattern that added to the group's capacity of reproducing itself and extending internationally. Regionally, the salg?w? have contributed enormously to spread the belief that Shaykh Ibr?h?m Niasse' announcement of the upcoming fayda of Shaykh Ahmad at-Tij?n? had been realized, and that the Senegalese was its depository. Locally, they have uplifted the position of Kan o in the geography of Nigerian scholarship to an unprecedented extent. The role of ta/i/&gt;-making in the town's life has also been pro foundly changed by the group's activities. Tafs?rhzs become an unfailing element of the urban populations collective life during the month of Ramad?n. The public tafstr boom has not been limited to Kano, but has had a pervasive effect on the style of Islamic public life in the whole of Nigeria. Successive reformist movements that will start their activities in the 1970s, though very different?in fact, opposed?in ideological orientation, will build on the exceptional popularity that tafs?r has attained in Northern Nigeria during the 1950s-60s, to carry out their distinctive agendas of reform.</page></plain_text>
