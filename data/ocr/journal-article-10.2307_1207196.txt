<plain_text><page sequence="1">MIND AND REALITY IN ROBBE-GRILLET AND PROUST Jack Murray Kierkegaard asserted that subjectivity is truth.' He might well have been speaking not only for his own contemporaries in European literature but even for writers of our present age. Subjectivity, of course, invariably calls to mind its supposed antithesis-objectivity. One imagines the two as polar opposites, mutually interdependent perhaps as Kant and his disciple Schopenhauer showed, but irrec- oncilably different in nature and hence unknowable to each other. Another way of seeing this antagonism is in the form of mind versus reality. And still another way, of course, is as art versus science. Two radical examples of contemporary French writers whose literary raison d'etre actually seems based on the mind and reality problem are Marcel Proust and Alain Robbe-Grillet. They are by no means the first or the only writers to take up the problem. The world view which their works evince, however, if not their very style, depends in large part upon their preoccupation with it. Fortunately, in the case of both writers we have explicit statements about how literature must deal with mind's relation to reality. Since these state- ments are perfectly straightforward, and since they are philosophical as well as literary in intent, they may better serve the purposes of our investigation than the authors' works themselves, analysis of which would of necessity be precariously inferential. Proust's statements are to be found in a long passage in Le Temps retrouv6,2 Robbe-Grillet's in his essay "Nature, humanisme, trag6die."3 1 Everett W. Knight, Literature Considered as Philosophy (London, 1957), p. 3. 2 A la recherche du temps perdu, vol.

WISCONSIN STUDIES VIII, 3</page><page sequence="2">Before passing to these statements, however, we must consider what the mind and reality problem actually is. It was Descartes, of course, who established the radical distinction between man as a being who thinks, on the one hand, and external reality, on the other. Because of this distinction, man came to identify himself-at least philosophically-as mind or consciousness and even different in nature from the body to which he appeared consigned. Locke went on to demonstrate that man perceives objects in the external world, not directly as had been thought before, but through "ideas" or representations formed in the mind from what we now call sense data. He also established the distinction (so useful to science) be- tween primary and secondary qualities, the former belonging to number, location, mass, and extension, the latter to color, sound, smell, etc. Of these qualities the primary could be analysed mathe- matically and were thus what we might call objective, whereas the latter could only be said to be products of the mind and hence sub- jective. Thus the gap began to widen between the mind of man and the reality he was endeavoring to observe. Of the many philosophers who dealed subsequently with the mind and reality problem Kant was perhaps the most influential. Not only did he give enormous importance to the role played by the mind in the perception of reality-specifically through his notion of cate- gories-but he also completed the rationale explaining that sense of divorce many laymen were already beginning to feel between them- selves and the external world. He did so by insisting that, while the synthesizing activity of the mind upon sense impressions could give us subjective concepts of things in the external world,4 these things as "things-in-themselves" could never be apprehended. They remained alien presences outside our grasp.5 Man would continue to dwell in his prison of thought, while reality would surround him on every side, unknown and unknowable. "The creation of two separate enti- 4Andr6 Ferr6 reproduces the following notes taken by Proust as a young student in a logic class at the lyc6e Condorcet: "Le concept est une creation de l'esprit, un petit organisme mental qui a bien pour matiere les sensations et les images, mais qui a pour forme les lois de l'esprit et pour Ame une certaine action de 1'esprit. D'ailleurs, le concept correspond a une partie de la r6alit6 qui n'est pas sensible mais seulement intelligible"; Les Annres de Collge de Marcel Proust (Paris, 1959), p. 246. Jacques Nathan reports Proust's brother as saying that Marcel remembered his revered philosophy professor, Darlu, chiefly for his teaching that one must guard against the objective reality of the external world; La Morale de Proust (Paris, 1953), p. 33. 5 Knight, p. 9. 408 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">ties, mind and body, which ... had such happy consequences for the development of the physical sciences, left to philosophy the problem, with which it has struggled miserably ever since, of reunit- ing them."6 One might add that it was to be literature's problem as well. These remarks will suffice for an introduction. Proust and Robbe-Grillet are not, after all, reacting to a specific philosophy but rather to a general philosophical orientation which they seem to accept without question. The orientation is, of course, dualism. "Most philosophers, psychologists, and religious teachers subscribe, with minor reservations, to its main articles and, although they admit certain theoretical difficulties in it, they tend to assume that these can be overcome without serious modifications being made to the architecture of the theory."'7 Of special interest to our two writers is how the mind will deal with the shortcomings of subjectivity or how the heart will respond. They are sensitive to the potentially tragic nature of the division between man and the world in which he dwells, and, while they do not see any way to overcome the division, they do see ways in which man, despite his position in the universe, may be ennobled by a lucid acceptance of it. Moreover, by their tendency to look upon objective vision and subjective vision as fun- damentally irreconcilable, they demonstrate that they are distinctly conscious, as writers, of having to justify the presumably subjective approach of literature in the light of the supposedly objective (and, according to many, superior) approach of science in the study or representation of "external" reality. Robbe-Grillet presents his arguments in the following way. There is the human mind, on the one hand, and things, on the other. Man has "subjectivized" the world surrounding him by anthropo- morphizing it (anthropomorphism, in Robbe-Grillet's terms, being synonymous with humanism) -i.e., man has bestowed upon things those qualities more fittingly descriptive of human beings, so that a mountain may be "majestic," a forest have a "heart," and the sun be "pitiless." And so a certain complicity is established between man and the non-human. The result of such complicity is the notion of a common essence: Nature. Of all the human means of anthropo- morphizing the non-human, literature is perhaps the most pernicious one, particularly by its use of metaphor. Through the analogy implicit 6 Ibid., p. 6. 7 Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of the Mind (New York, 1949), p. 11. PROUST AND ROBBE-GRILLET 1 409</page><page sequence="4">in metaphor we entrap objects in our own purely human web. Com- plicity with objects creates an aura of necessity. When a character in a novel is sad, for example, the landscape he views inevitably becomes depressing also. It comes to seem as if a necessary relation- ship between the character's sadness and the landscape had been established-i.e., a predestined and even fatal one. Tragedy begins when man becomes aware that, despite all his efforts to close it, an unbreachable gap remains between himself and the non-human por- tion of the universe. Instead of accepting this gap in a matter-of- fact way, he prefers to endow it with human significance. The gap becomes a cause of despair, and in despair man sees the gap expand and the fissures multiply between himself and all other things. Thus tragedy is primarily an attitude caused by false assumptions about the non-human and therefore ought not to be magnified into being an autonomous aspect of the universe itself. In order to escape human- ism, with its concept of Nature and its overtones of fatalism and tragedy,8 Robbe-Grillet proposes stripping literary language of meta- phor-the initial cause of error-and dealing with objects in the utilitarian language of scientific description. It is striking how much Robbe-Grillet's concept of the New Novel (as it has come to be called) corresponds, in its direction, with the third age of Comte's Positivist arrangement of history. For, in theory, Robbe-Grillet's ultimate target is metaphysics, which he con- ceives of as being a direct outgrowth of the anthropomorphic view of the universe. Science is the most hopeful antidote for metaphysics, since it concentrates on the verifiable and the measurable and does not add any purely human superfluities. The literature and philoso- phy of the past, Robbe-Grillet says in an interesting analogy, has repeated over and over again the same answer to the eternal riddle of the Sphinx. Even recent literature, though at first glance seemingly aware of the gap between men and things (and here Robbe-Grillet is speaking of Sartre, Ponge, and Camus), insists on looking at this gap as paradoxical. The gap, by meaning nothing, means something. In Sartre's case, it is absurd and causes nausea. The moment they attempt to emphasize this paradoxical gap in their writing, Sartre and Camus involuntarily slip into the language of metaphor. Camus, for s Knight, p. 35: "Before a return to things in themselves can be realized, two conditions must be fulfilled: the exterior world must not be considered as affording access to some metaphysical, 'higher' reality; and the traditional con- ception of the ego, or self, must not be allowed to interpose itself between things and our perception of them." 410 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">example, makes the sun an accomplice in Meursault's shooting the Arab in L'Etranger. Robbe-Grillet insists that things have no meaning outside the use men make of them and offers the example of the hammer which has no meaning outside its use as a tool. Once the hammer has driven in the nail it has no further meaning.9 Proust, of course, seems far removed from these concerns. In typically sumptuous sentences, he discourses on the highest work of art as being-or so one gathers-a plastic rendering of the content of the artist's soul. To this extent, a novel, for example, pre-exists its being written, since it is, in great part, the very fabric of the artist's inner nature. Composing a work of art comes to be a form of self-discovery and self-perpetuation. Self-discovery, however, is not purely personal, but rather the purely personal is (in the tradition of Montaigne) used only insofar as it may reveal eternal laws and universal essences. The universality of a work of art is commensurate with the extent of the artist's plunge inside himself. If he goes far enough, he will reach the common bedrock of all mankind, even though, at first sight, he has spoken only for himself. For Proust, a novel must be the vehicle of inner discovery. Dis- covery lies at the end of the long and arduous search the author must conduct through his own private impressions and memories. Proust has little use for the writer who forsakes this private search and takes the easy short cut through general theory whereby he falsely believes he will arrive at the truth with greater speed and less toil. The style the author develops must seek to express that inner reality which is the proper domain of the author. Inner reality is found in the author's sensibility. Artistic sense, properly defined, is submission to this inner reality. By exploring it, the author will be able to find analogies between various private experiences and, through them, uncover the general essence or the basic laws of existence. Metaphor is the literary means of reproducing the essence found in the com- parison of analogous inner experiences, for it too is based on analogy. Indeed, a successful metaphor, Proust claims, corresponds with a causal law discovered in the exact sciences. Style must also recon- struct the life surrounding these truths found within. Finally, the mysterious aura, hovering over any great author's style, is in part the vestige of that inner darkness through which he has had to search. Even though much of what the two authors say has little in 9 Ibid., p. 29, p. 72. PROUST AND ROBBE-GRILLET 411</page><page sequence="6">common, it is fairly obvious on which points they would disagree. The first point of disagreement, clearly, is that, if Robbe-Grillet is out to attack those who anthropomorphize the universe, then surely Proust would be one of his prime targets. Even for those less severe than Robbe-Grillet, Proust has perhaps gone too far in depicting the external world as little more than a frame of reference for the responses of a deeply introverted sensibility. Proust, on the other hand, would find nothing more repugnant than the idea that an author's style should adhere to the imperatives of a theory in which there is no concern for beauty whatsoever.'0 A basic point of disagreement would clearly be the matter of suitable literary language. For Robbe-Grillet, it must be stripped of metaphor and emulate the concise descriptiveness of objective scien- tific language. Proust refers to the style of such literal representations of reality as cinematographical, since all that is given is what even the most casual or insensitive observer could easily see. For him, literary language does not become interesting until it endeavors to record the private impression left by an object on the individual sensi- bility. Metaphor is a prerequisite for describing this inner impression. A small object, if described in purely objective language, remains merely small. Thus an author cannot communicate the enormous importance a small object might have for a particular individual (although quite clearly Robbe-Grillet overcomes this difficulty by repeating over and over the description of any object important to his individual character). Cinematographical descriptions, according to Proust, repeat the lie of conventional sight which insists on rele- gating everything to an innocuous and unnoticeable monotone. A madeleine remains only a tea-cake. Thus inner reality is left untapped, and the author is limited to the community property aspect of trivial, everyday language. Robbe-Grillet, however, emphasizes that there is a crucial difference between the cinematographical and his own style of writing. For one thing, the cinema presents things such as any spectator might see them, thus even permitting anthropomorphism, whereas a scientifically expressed style forces the spectator to see things in a detached and objective way from which any anthropo- morphizing would be excluded. Robbe-Grillet believes that using the non-human as an accom- plice in private "6tats d'Ime" makes them seem inevitable or pre- destined. For Proust, on the other hand, the non-human can have 10Nathalie Sarraute justifies the New Novelists' indifference to the bellet- tristic style in L'Ere du Souppon (Paris, 1956), pp. 142-143. 412 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">no sense, except when appropriated by the individual sensibility. For him it is not so much a predestined relationship as a fundamental condition or truth of nature. Robbe-Grillet's highest purpose is to find freedom (in a some- what Sartrian sense) by putting things back out in reality where they belong. "Les choses sont les choses, et l'homme n'est que l'homme." He deplores the Greco-Christian tradition of man as the measure of all things. This tradition implies a superior order com- mon to all men and things-in short, a metaphysical order. He asserts that the universe outside man has no meaning, metaphysics being only the result of a false complicity between it and man. Man is free to break this "pact" at any time. By purging the universe of gratuitous meaning man regains his freedom. While Proust does not discuss this matter directly, one may safely assume that he would have felt it beyond human means to see the universe in any but human terms. Moreover, as he repeatedly shows, each human being sees the universe in his own private terms. While it is possible, of course, to describe the universe outside man in scientific language, the result could only be a display of blank and empty surfaces without significance. Reality can only have mean- ing when the human soul reacts to its own private vision of it. By establishing reality, as seen from within, in the eternal bonds of a beautiful style," it is rescued from triviality and endowed with life and sense. While not designating it as metaphysical, Proust nonethe- less does perceive an invisible order which encloses man and the reality surrounding him. This order is intimated to Proust's narrator in a series of well-known experiences in which something like ideal intuition takes place. Style should have, as its main goal, the expres- sion of the reality of this invisible order, glimpsed by such intuition, and which indeed must be sought under or behind the surfaces of the everyday world. At his most extreme, Proust not only believes that a familiar spirit lurks behind the superficial content of percep- tion but that it is possible for him to enter into communication with such a spirit. Proust may thus be seen as shamelessly anthropomor- phic and metaphysical in Robbe-Grillet's terms. Even in the midst of their differences, however, Robbe-Grillet and Proust do have certain things in common. Both authors speak in terms of the mind and the world. They are so insistent on this dis- 11 Leo Spitzer describes Proust's vision as "eine Tiitigkeit des ordnenden Verstands. Und dieser ordnende Verstand hat auch den eigentiimlichen, ordent- lichen, zusammengerafften Satztypus Proust's geschaffen." See Stilstudien, II (Munich, 1928), p. 369. PROUST AND ROBBE-GRILLET 413</page><page sequence="8">tinction that they go to opposite extremes to express it. In reading a novel by Robbe-Grillet, we are gradually overwhelmed by the objec- tive description of things, until we are completely hindered from endowing them with any human significance whatsoever. Indeed, whatever role particular minds may play in his novels is concealed beneath a heavy surface of unexplained detail and is only obliquely implied. With Proust, on the other hand, we are brought ever closer to complete subjectivism, so that finally reality seems little more than a private spectacle in the mind of his narrator. Both writers are obsessive watchers. Each gives exhaustive ac- counts of perception, Robbe-Grillet dwelling endlessly on the surface of things, Proust indefatigably mining his sensibility and intellect as he responds to things. Robbe-Grillet endeavors to record perception before it has been endowed with human meaning, while Proust dwells on the infinite responses found in the mind and heart as perception is absorbed by the individual sensibility. Both writers agree on the subjective nature of vision. Robbe- Grillet, however, does not see this as a form of servitude. For him it is merely a point of view. Proust, on the other hand, has so intense an attitude toward the subjective nature of sight that he tends to verge on solipsism. Proust believes that the artist must concentrate on expressing the peculiarities of his own personal vision of the universe. In terms of literature, we read authors to discover how the world looks to them, so that we may better understand our own view and even enhance it with the knowledge we receive when reading the commentaries of other observers. Both writers would concur on the total solitude of man. For Robbe-Grillet, this means that man is the only witness of reality. While this is a restriction, it is not a limitation. For Proust, solitude is set in its older context as that state in which man is hopelessly and irredeemably alone. Robbe-Grillet's picture of man as a solitary wit- ness is meant to be nothing more than a "constat" pure and simple. Proust, on the other hand, sees the eternal isolation of each man from all other men as a potential source of agony, yet also-para- doxically-as a point of departure for a goal that lies somewhere outside the prison of individual consciousness. Art affords spiritual redemption from solitude for Proust, whereas Robbe-Grillet-indeed expressing scorn for such a use of art-believes that literature must both insist on this solitude and rescue it from the overtones of tragedy. If we are searching for a common trait which unites two such utterly dissimilar authors as Proust and Robbe-Grillet it is their unu- 414 J CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">sual preoccupation with the idea that the mind and the world are two distinct entities not entirely compatible in nature. The mind, while being a unique vantage point, dwells in some dimension of its own from which it witnesses outside reality through the senses. Real- ity remains in a shadowy Newtonian void of its own until appre- hended by consciousness. Once reality is apprehended, a process of meaning takes place. Represented schematically, this process con- sists of such preliminary mental acts as identification of a particular object perceived, followed by other mental acts of a more abstract nature-association of what is perceived, for example, with the memory of a similar object, or else planning some use to put the object to, or perhaps mere enjoyment of its shape, taste, color, or sound. (For the sake of simplicity, I shall not delve into the subcon- scious or unconscious aspects of mental activity, although it is well to point out how important these are to both writers.) Proust is most interested in what the mind does with perception after indentifica- tion, while for Robbe-Grillet, all further stages beyond identification are gratuitous additions which can easily lead to an erroneous and misleading understanding of reality. In either case, however, we see two utterly different realms confronting each other: the world on the one side and the mind on the other. An example of this division may be found in Proust in an episode where the narrator looks out over Venice, although the example will do for either author: La ville que j'avais devant moi avait cess6 d'etre Venise. Sa person- nalit6, son nom, me paraissaient comme des fictions mensongeres que je n'avais plus le courage d'inculquer aux pierres. Les palais m'apparaissaient r'duits ' leurs simples parties et quantites de marbre pareilles a toutes autres, et l'eau comme une combinaison d'hydrogene et d'azote, 6ternelle, aveugle, anterieure et exterieure a Venise, ignorante des Doges et de Turner.12 Robbe-Grillet, in order to portray the world before it has been domesticated by the individual, would endeavor to describe Venice before it had become Venice, to describe just that-a collection of geometrical solids and chemical liquids: reality almost as it is before being observed by man. Proust, on the other hand, would only be interested in that moment when Venice becomes Venice; and for this, perception must be absorbed by the individual consciousness and enriched by meaning which only the mind can give. In terms 12 Proust, vol. III, p. 652. PROUST AND ROBBE-GRILLET j 415</page><page sequence="10">of Marcel, Venice is an exotic fairy city, rich in art and wonderfully endowed with a most glorious and purely human past. The transfer of bare, unannotated perception to personal meaning is, in truth, a creative process: man does, in fact, make private use of external detail. Hence, the world changes from what it actually is (e.g., un- named masses of stone among bodies of unspecified liquids) into what the mind makes of it (Venice).:3 For Proust, this is a significant transfer, because what the world actually is turns out to be, after all, an uninteresting matter, whereas what the mind makes of it is of overwhelming importance. Robbe- Grillet, on the other hand, is repelled by this absorption of the world into meaning, because it is a form of distortion whereby man obscures from himself his proper place in the universe. Even though the remedy he suggests-the language of scientific description-is surely as much a product of the human mind as the most abstuse of meta- physical systems, it has the saving grace of confining itself to the measurable and the verifiable. Certainly the observation that a mountain is ten thousand feet high is less dangerous than the com- ment that it is "a lofty sentinel guarding the heights." At any rate, for both authors meaning is some sort of commen- tary made by the mind about what it perceives in that other domain, the world. In these terms, it is understandable why Proust thought meaning was so utterly relative. A la recherche dwells to the point of tedium on how differently different minds will see the same thing, since in every case meaning becomes not understanding shared with a general community but rather a distillation of private considerations and set patterns of values or attitudes peculiar to each mind. This leads to a perpetual comedy (and sometimes tragedy) of errors, as the author moves from character to character and from mind to mind, detailing how each reacts when confronted with the same object or situation. To each character the object or situation will look completely different. Yet Proust takes heart. For he comes to see that the mind is distinct, in that it can remember, devise abstract con- structions of thought from the various data provided by experience, and finally, perhaps, catch a glimpse of a world more like its ethereal self beyond the blinding surfaces of external reality. Robbe-Grillet, on the other hand, shares Jean-Paul Sartre's curi- 13 J. M. Cocking points out that Proust felt external reality to be not only unknowable but, if viewed without the defensive interposition of sub- jective associations, to be "at best indifferent and at worst hostile to the sub- ject." See Proust (New Haven, 1956), p. 36. 416 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">osity as to what that other domain, 4 the world outside, is really like-i.e., before it has been domesticated by man and converted into a mere accessory of his own existence. He therefore tries to describe this world as it must be before it has thus been tamed. It is obvious, of course, that the descriptions of that other domain can at best be only tentative. Hence, Robbe-Grillet is forced to dwell inordinately on experiments in descriptive technique, even at the expense of other important aspects of the novel. At any rate, Robbe- Grillet concerns himself with objects as objects, because he sees them as distinct in nature from particular, identifiable things surrounding men who live casually in the everyday setting of the ordinary world. An investigation of Proust's and Robbe-Grillet's comments leads one to the conclusion that both have magnified (perhaps to an unrea- sonable degree) the positive and negative powers of the mind. This is so, because they both separate the mind from the world in which it exists. Each author sends the mind off in a radical direction: Proust inwards, Robbe-Grillet outwards. Both do so for the sake of what they term reality, Proust intoxicated with what he terms inner reality and Robbe-Grillet obsessed by the notion of some outer sort of reality, different in nature from what man habitually sees. The intensity of each author's stand on the mind versus reality question is best illustrated by the fact that this question virtually dominates all other aspects of their novels. In Proust this is seen ex- plicitly in the dramatic emphasis he gives to all forms of mental and spiritual activity. This activity may range from ecstatic moments of recollection to quasi-mystical intimations of communion with extra- temporal spheres. In Robbe-Grillet, the emphasis is all on objective detail, sometimes presented as it is seen by one of his characters, sometimes described directly from reality. By his strict reliance on external details dispassionately reported to the reader, it is frequently difficult to determine which point of view we are dealing with. The point of such ambiguity is to accentuate the divorce between consciousness and external world. It is the world that interests Robbe- Grillet. Both Proust and Robbe-Grillet, by their own comments, indi- cate the crucial relationship between what we have been discussing and the matter of language and style. Only Robbe-Grillet, of course, makes a basic criticism of language and style. Proust, on the con- trary, seems to have been content to share the general concept of his 14 Cf. Jean-Paul Sartre, Situations, vol. I (Paris, 1947), p. 256. PROUST AND ROBBE-GRILLET 1 417</page><page sequence="12">day that language was a means of symbolizing the images, ideas, or feelings entertained by one mind and transmitting them to another. If the mind was just "a sort of calculating machine into which one inserts a piece of paper called a perception to be processed by the machinery of association and immediately returned marked 'ship at sea' or 'sound of music','" language had to follow perception and try to promote similar responses. Since this was a most unsatisfactory process, Proust sought to increase the evocative powers of language by exploiting the associative or aesthetic aspect of words in the man- ner of symbolist poetry.'6 Indeed, there was nothing gratuitous in Proust's efforts toward beauty in style. All his attention was focussed on making language transmit this inner idea, image, or emotion he felt so keenly and make it have a parallel impact upon his reader. He could therefore not possibly have been interested in the question whether metaphor was an "honest" device or not; he could only be concerned with its expressiveness. Robbe-Grillet, in his discussion of language and style, shifts the emphasis so completely that we are at first not aware that his concept of language is scarcely different from Proust's. The emphasis, of course, is on the very nature of language, taken as a whole. He has nothing but distrust for the entire battery of traditional literary tech- niques. "La m6taphore," he says, "n'est jamais une figure innocente." He believes stylistic devices as such go too far beyond the beauteous confines of mere expressiveness. Yet here his concept of language shows itself not only similar to Proust's but even more involved in the psychology of mind. For it appears that even to speak at all about that domain lying outside the mind is to involve it in what is not proper to it. Language, then, is not merely an aggregate of symbols whereby the mind communicates its ideas and impressions to other minds but is above all a means of transposing that other domain out- side into purely inner equivalents. An object, merely by becoming a reflection or perception in the consciousness of the human observer, is transformed in its very nature. Additional transformation is accom- plished by the object's being turned into a mere vocal sound or group of symbols scratched on a page. While Robbe-Grillet sees no way out of this quandary (he must use words, after all), he finds that the language of scientific description shows the most proper respect for what lies outside the human. Through a purely objective descriptive 15 Knight, p. 21. 16 Cf. Proust, vol. I, pp. 387-388. 418 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="13">technique, he will be able to put things back more nearly into their own perspective. This is not to say that they will be freed of the mind (how could they be, if they are going to be spoken about?), but they will at least not be involved in some abstract animistic scheme. The unexpected result of Robbe-Grillet's technique, however, is that, once the reader has become used to the novelty of endless methodical descriptions of objects, he begins to realize that he is imprisoned in a subjective world as oppressive as the one described by Proust-if not more so. This impression is especially enhanced by the mental agitation of the observer whose point of view the author uses to describe reality. In La Jalousie we are aware of the obsessive review of facts by the jealous husband; in Le Voyeur and Dans le labyrinthe we are dealing with mental disturbance. Moreover, the author is providing us not so much with "live" exposure to reality as with reality mused upon in the frequently muddled mind of his protagonist. Often the author indicates, by relating an event in a variety of ways, that his protagonist may be suffering from delusions or else is reviewing a scene in the fanciful confines of his own mind. The fact that both illusion and direct perception of reality are described with the same technique tends to convert even objectively recorded reality into purely private mental distortions of the external world. Subjectivity, then, is not only truth but a rather strange truth at that. If Robbe-Grillet may be said to have one major theme, it is the discovery that man cannot really substitute an alternate coherent view of reality for the human one. Man and reality will forever elude each other. Hence, Robbe-Grillet has not eliminated the gap separat- ing them; he has only said that it is not a tragic one-it is merely there. We come therefore to see that both Proust and Robbe-Grillet can be said to share a similar view: namely that man is mostly mind, cast adrift in an utterly foreign dimension of mute matter, space, and time, and is by nature incapable of crossing over the barrier separat- ing him from it. Although beset by agony, Proust was content to dwell in a domain of mind and investigate the laws of this ethereal realm. Robbe-Grillet, on the other hand, while forced to admit that no true escape is possible, believes that the practice of certain stylis- tic techniques will enable him to portray this foreign realm in which he lives more truthfully and more persuasively than any writer has done before and perhaps restore man to his proper place in the world. While one may at first be tempted to say that the similarities between Proust and Robbe-Grillet enhance the notion of there being PROUST AND ROBBE-GRILLET 419</page><page sequence="14">an explicit group of characteristic themes involving all of twentieth century French literature, one is still left with the impression that the two authors are very strange bedfellows indeed. Rather, it might be better to say that both authors are confronted with the same dilemma which all serious authors have had to face since Romanti- cism: how to reconcile literature with metaphysics and how to make peace with an objective world existing apart from man while using an essentially subjective vehicle of human expression. In respect to the latter, Proust felt that literature was much better equipped to describe the external world than science, whereas Robbe-Grillet believes that literature would do well to emulate the language and principles involved in the scientific analysis of reality. The decisive point of difference between Robbe-Grillet and Proust arises on the matter of what Robbe-Grillet calls Nature. From the latter's point of view, obviously no one could sin more grievously than Proust when it comes to involving the objects around one in a sort of cozy complicity. On the other hand, as we have seen, both Proust and Robbe- Grillet appear to believe that there is a complete gap between human mind and brute, alien reality. This obviously implies that literature is no closer to finding a solution for the dilemma now than in Proust's day, let alone before. While Robbe-Grillet speaks of his work as a pursuit of freedom, it is not so much a freedom from the dilemma (ceasing to anthropomorphize will only heighten the gap between man and thing) but a kind of stoic detachment (the author does not want man to be upset by it and turn it into a tragic matter). It is most likely that French literature will continue to engage in the struggle of bridging the abyss between man, the inner creature, and the universe outside him. Considering the way the dilemma has been posed, there is no reason why it should not go on indefinitely. University of California, Santa Barbara 420 j CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page></plain_text>
