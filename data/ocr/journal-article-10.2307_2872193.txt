<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MUSIC OF LOST DYNASTIES: BROWNING, POUND AND HISTORY BY JACOB KORG Ezra Pound's acknowledgment of his debt to Browning, the only one of the major Victorian poets he admired, is usually understood to mean that he imitated the older poet's vigorous conversational style and used forms adapted from the dramatic monologue. But he was also indebted to Browning's example for the dominant mode of the Cantos, the fusion of poetry and history. Aristotle, in distinguishing between the two, had con- ceded that historical events might be appropriate poetic subjects if they corresponded with universals, and Browning and Pound both felt that their favorite historical periods, at least, had enduring significance. Both poets responded strongly to the mute eloquence of old books, objects, towns, and works of art. J. P. Sullivan has observed that Pound was so fully occupied with history that he seemed to do his work in a musee imaginaire.' After the first of the Cantos had been published, Pound wrote to Margaret Anderson: " I desire to go on with my long poem; and like the Duke of Chang, I desire to hear the music of a lost dynasty. (Have managed to hear it, in fact) .' 2 Pound's feeling for history was clearly his own. But Browning's historical poems, especially Sordello, and, to a lesser extent, The Ring and the Book, seem to have shown him how historical materials could contribute to the renovation of poetry. Like Browning, he believed that certain aspects of the past reflected his own convictions with special clarity, and offered indispensable chances for demonstrating the cohesion of fact and poetic imagi- nation. This approach to history had strong support among the Romantics. In arguing that poetry is superior to story in "A Defence of Poetry," Shelley criticized strictly factual accounts as " the moths of just history" because they omitted the per- 'Ezra Pound and Sextus Propertius (Austin, Texas, 1964), p. 4. 2 Letters, p. 128 (? January 1918). 420 The Music of Lost Dynasties</page><page sequence="2">manent and universal truths which could only be expressed in poetry. Browning, drawing upon the ideas of the " Defence " in his essay on Shelley, suggested that the knowledge of a time when factual information was abundant but disordered should be consolidated through the organizing power of poetic perception. History may be regarded as an instance of such knowledge; it is a particularly crucial instance because it belongs (or belonged) to actuality and is subject to common agreement, so that the poet's interpretation of it must compete with other opinions. The aim of Browning's historical poetry, as Pound understood, was neither factual accuracy nor pure self-expression, but a con- ception of truth arising from the interpenetration of historical material and poetic imagination, united in a new genre that combined the validity of the first with the vitality of the second. The Cantos in its final state does not show how important Browning's precedent was to Pound's conception of his poem. The original version of Canto 1, published as the first of " Three Cantos " in Poetry in 1917, begins with the line) " Hang it all, there can be but one Sordello! " as the introduction to a long address to Browning on the subject of -the peculiarities of his Sordello and its value as a prototype for the Cantos.' It shows that Pound thought of writing a work about some important literary initiator, like Browning's hero, and intended to make his poem continuous, in some sense, with Sordello. Nearly all of this material was deleted in the final version, and the Canto itself was moved to second place in the sequence, so that Browning no longer has the prominence he deserves as a progenitor of the Cantos. Still, the opening of what is now Canto 2 does make the connection: Hang it all, Robert Browning, there can be but the one " Sordello." But Sordello, and my Sordello? Lo Sordels si fo di Mantovana.4 Where is Pound's Sordello? He has been lost with the rejected version of the Canto, which, after telling the story of a man from " middle Indiana" cwho studied art in Europe and then returned to do odd jobs in his home town, ends with " Take my Sordello!

Jacob Korg 421</page><page sequence="3">The revised passage eliminates this ironic association, but it does preserve an idea more fully expressed in the original Canto, Pound's ambition of emulating Browning by creating his own hero set in his own version of history. The fourth line-" Lo Sordels si fo di Mantovana "-indicates how this project might be carried out. It is the first sentence of a manuscript summa- rizing the life of the poet which Pound had read at the Ambrosian library in Milan.5 Pound is suggesting that he, like Browning, can turn to first-hand evidence as a basis for the imaginative reconstruction of the past. But he realizes that he cannot blindly follow the lead of the showman,c "Bob Browning," whose irrepressible theatrical elan in recreating vivid historical scenes produces tricks that violate modernist scruples. If he were to imitate Browning, speculates Pound, he would have to " Give up th'intaglio method," the sharp economy of style he admired in Gautier, which had become one of the principles of Imagism. His skeptical age demands a firmer grounding of the imagination in actuality, and a simpler diction. But while he intends to maintain a clearer sense of immediacy, he nevertheless warns himself against the illusion that the past is actually accessible in all its fullness. Knowledge of other times and scenes can never be more than a faint impression: a whiff of it- The box of scented wood Recalls cathedrals. More particularly, he must not impose his own consciousness upon externals: Confuse my own phantastikon, Or say the filmy shell that circumscribes me Contains the actual sun.6 On the contrary, the value of Browning's treatment of history was that it expanded the reader's consciousness, and enabled him to participate in other experiences: 'A translation of this document appears in " Troubadours-Their Sorts and Conditions," first published in the Quarterly Review in 1913 and reprinted in Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, ed. T. S. Eliot (New York, 1935), pp. 94-108. 6 "Three Cantos," p. 120. This image is clarified by Pound's explanation that the phantastikon was what Greek psychologists called the seat of consciousness in some men. "Their minds are, that is, circumvolved about them like soap-bubbles reflecting sundry patches of the macrocosmos." The Spirit of Romance (New York, [1910)), p. 92. 422 The Music of Lost Dynasties</page><page sequence="4">. . what were the use Of setting figures up and breathing life upon them, Weren't not our life, your life, my life, extended? I walk Verona. (I am here in England.) I see Can Grande. (Can see whom you will.)7 In spite of his reservations about Browning's diction, objectivity, and perhaps, his ultimate seriousness, Pound saw in Sordello a " new forr a " rag-bag " of eclectic and even anachronistic materials appropriate to the modern age. He somewhat grudg- ingly conceded that Browning, through his bold conjuring-up of historical scenes (" Ye believe? Appears Verona . . .") had invented a flying carpet that could successfully ignore the ordi- nary conventions of time and space, moving about to revitalize a past in danger of being lost and demonstrate its continuity with the present. As Pound self-consciously tries his hand at this method, building up a vision of Sirmio, we become aware that we are encountering for the first time a tactic fundamental to the Cantos-the swift and vivid evocation of a historical setting. Having demonstrated his skill and concluded that he is equipped to follow Browning's lead, Pound asks, " What's left for me to do? . . . Who's my Sordello? " a question answered in the next Canto by the appearance of the man from Indiana. In his use of history, as in his use of the dramatic monologue, Pound took Browning first as a model and then as a point of departure. As his notion of poetry was modified by Imagism, Fenollosa and other influences, and his idea of history by Con- fucian sources, he moved away from Browning's specific practices; but the older poet's solution of the problems inherent in the poetic treatment of history became a part of the fabric of the Cantos. Two of Browning's views are particularly prominent in Pound's performance: the principle that the poet must have as direct an experience of historical particulars as records and remains can provide; and the belief that the poetic imagination is capable of renewing the forgotten-or near-forgotten-past and restoring it to meaning. The conviction that authentic historical events provided better material for poetry than anything that might be invented created a conflict of obligations that each poet had to resolve in his own way. Harriet Martineau, after a conversation with Browning at 7 cc Three Cantos," p. 115. Jacob Korg 423</page><page sequence="5">the time he was writing Sordello, reported that he was in a dilemma: "He must choose between being historian or poet. Cannot split interest." 8 Browning certainly played the part of a historian in gathering the material for his historical poems. Although he intended to emphasize character rather than ex- ternals in Sordello, he consulted thirty sources for it, and in 1838, after working on various drafts for five years, dropped it temporarily to spend more than three months visiting scenes in northern Italy associated with the poem. This journey, according to DeVane, provided Browning with a knowledge of the local scenes needed to animate his treatment of historical elements. Browning's masterly evocation of atmosphere, a gift recognized by Ruskin and Henry James, depends heavily on his use of authentic particulars. DeVane also believes that the visit to Italy led Browning to shift his emphasis from the romantic story to Sordello's political efforts on behalf of the common people. Georg Lukaics' observation that such local color as Scott's is not merely ornamental, but is "the artistic demonstration of his- torical reality," ' suggests that the two results of the Italian journey were really parts of a single determination on Browning's part to strengthen the historical authenticity of his poem. In his devotion to the actualities of history, Browning even approached the device of documentation, embedding parts of original historical texts in his poems. His gestures in this direction include the Latin phrases drawn from The Old Yellow Book which constitute a good part of the statement of the lawyer Arcangeli in The Ring and the Book, and the translation of Alcestis in Balaustion's Adventure. For Browning, as for his character, Fra Lippo Lippi, moral ideas are embodied in the material world; his flights toward spiritual insight carry the ballast of the sensuous and the particular, and his general moral vision depends for much of its authority on a communion with actuality: ". . . the world is not to be learned and thrown aside,'&gt; he said in his "Essay on Shelley," "but reverted to and re- learned." 10 His linking of the actual and the symbolic so that they move together toward the same goal may be seen as a modest anticipation of the modernist attempt to remove the dis- 8Quoted in A Browning Handbook by W.

Pound took note of the effectiveness of Browning's historical details, and also of the fact that he used them incorrectly. Mistakes and anachronisms were not important, however, for the value of such particulars arises, he thought, not from their historical accuracy, but from their effectiveness as expressive re- sources. The actual sequence of things, he wrote in Guide to Kulchhur, is less important than an appreciation of a process as a whole. The example of Browning, together with the Imagist emphasis on the concrete and the Confucian virtue of particu- larity combined to form Pound's powerful-almost belligerent- belief in the necessity of the specific. The point that "i knowledge resides in particulars" is explained in Guide to Kulchur: Con- fucius demanded that cognition should be based on "concrete manifestations" because only knowledge derived from primary experience enters into perception and affects the whole of man's existence."1 It is natural, therefore, that the Cantos, like Sordello and The Ring and the Book, should strive to embody its historicity in specific, vivid details. Pound reaches for direct access to the lived past both through images involving the primary perceptions shared by men of all times, such as experiences of light, wind and water, and through authentic facts drawn from his sources. In inserting borrowings from reality into the imaginative frame- work of his poem he followed a precedent set, as we have seen, by Browning. The Cantos generally and the Malatesta, Chinese and Adams sections in particular, contain a good deal of quotation, chronicle, translation and other solid historical stuff which con- fronts the reader not, perhaps, with the past itself, but with evidence of the past accessible to direct experience. The trans- lation from Andreas Divus and the contents of Malatesta's post- bag are the first of many authentic texts reproduced in extenso ill the Cantos, and besides these there are, of course, innumerable shorter quotations, allusions and ideograms that import the presence of some historical original into the poem. All of these are sources of the immediacy Pound considers vital to poetic cognition. While such particulars are meant to participate in the general " Guide to Kulchur (Norfolk, Connecticut, 1952), p. 21. Jacob Korg 425</page><page sequence="7">vision of the Cantos, each remarkably retains a sharp individu- ality in the crowded space of the poem. "What is intended," says Donald Davie, in defining this quality, "is a sort of lamination, by no means a compounding or confusing of distinct historical phases into an undifferentiated amalgam." 2 The poem consists of layers, each distinct from the others, creating effects of depth, contrast, distance and movement. An appreciation of the haecceitas that even ephemeral forces temporarily achieve within the design of the poem is expressed in Pound's description of the movements of water: Ply over ply, thin glitter of water: Brook film bearing white petals . . Ply over ply The shallow eddying fluid. The recurrent " ply over ply " formula is used in contexts where, as Walter Baumann says, "it lends itself to the creation of a pattern indicating an infinitely graduated phenomenon, the parts of which are complementary." 14 The past also forms a pattern of this sort in the Cantos, for in the 1917 version of Canto 2, Pound uses the phrase to express his sense of history. After reporting that he has seen a centaur and nymphs at Dordoigne, and many processions at Salisbury, he sums up, " Ply over ply of life still -wraps the earth here." 15 The theory of the historical poem which Browning followed in Sordello and The Ring and the Book is made explicit in passages from both poems. In Book V of So'rdello, the hero, perplexed both by his failure to hold an audience with his songs, and by his inability to gain support for the Guelph cause, rises to a number of poetic and political insights. A voice in his heart expresses an idea that was to become one of Browning's central doctrines: that individual men are in the ironic position of being able to envision, but not to achieve timeless perfection; that each must be content to work in time, through step-by-step processes, and 2 Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor (New York, 1964), p. 123. 18 Canto 4, The Cantos, p. 15. " The Rose in the Steel Dust (Berne, 1967), p. 63. 1T " Three Cantos," p. 182. This formula may well have been borrowed from Sordello (Browning, op. cit., p. 112): See him stand Buttressed upon his mattock, Hildebrand Of the huge brain-mask welded ply o'er ply As in a forge. 426 The Music of Lost Dynasties</page><page sequence="8">to make a first effort without any assurance that it will lead to an ultimate goal. Achievement is historical, a matter of interlinked acts, one built upon another. Sordello sees that " collective man / Outstrips the individual," that political moves cannot succeed in isolation, but must be based on earlier developments, and must correspond to general historical currents. When his plea before Salinguerra on behalf of the Guelphs is met with sarcasm about the impotence of minstrels, Sordello is compelled to re-examine the purpose and method of his art. He begins with the conviction that "Thought is the soul of act," and that the poet therefore has a responsibility for the deeds of men. His plan for meeting this responsibility corresponds with Browning's account, in his " Essay on Shelley," of the two phases which alternate with each other to produce progress in poetry. In one phase the poet who is in touch with higher truths, coming into a period of stale poetic convention, shatters the settled assumptions of his contemporaries, and frees the raw materials of art, so that they can become objects of direct experience again. This fruitful, but chaotic situation is corrected when a subjective and reflective poet comes on the scene to harmonize the newly- discovered materials into a unified vision; the two phases taken together constitute a step up the ladder of poetic accomplish- ment. Sordello feels that he must perform both of these functions himself, carrying out a process of re-interpreting history through poetry. His work must begin with a first stage employing a broad, emphatic style that clearly defines the moral stature of historical personages and creates a usable past in the minds of his readers: To-day Takes in account the work of Yesterday: Has not the world a Past now, its adept Consults ere he dispense with or accept New aids? 16 Having established this base, the poet is free to practice an innovative poetry of subtle suggestion, stringent economy and fleeting allusion, for to those who have learned his code, ". . . a single touch . . . may enhance . . . Those structures' symmetry the past has strewed / The world with.. . ." This second style, as Browning says in a famous and irresponsible authorial interpo- 16 Complete Poetical Works, p. 116. Jacob Korg 427</page><page sequence="9">lation, is also the style of Sordlello itself. The text of the poem describes it as a style of decomposition, but the explanatory headings Browning added to the edition of 1863 label the move- ment from the first style to the second as a progression from the role of " analyst " to that of " synthetist." He apparently felt that while the new style may " decompose " characters, it achieves the synthesis of a moral unity between the poet and the reader, and enables the poet to fulfill his ambition of bringing people to share his views. Already you include The multitude; then let the multitude Include yourself; and the result were new: Themselves before, the multitude turn you.1 The discussion of art and truth in Book 1 of The Ring and the Book may be usefully regarded as an elaboration and defense of the poetic method worked out by Sordello. Artistic creation, says Browning, in introducing his long poem, is not sheer invention, but a process of renewing what already exists. Creation from nothing is a privilege reserved for God alone. Man cannot " light a virgin wick." But through the poetic imagination, " a special gift, an art of arts," he can send his soul into forms of human life that are nearly defunct, " some fragment of a whole, / Rag of flesh, scrap of bone in dim disuse," enter them, revive them, and make them meaningful again. This is no more than a " mimic creation," a cc galvanism," a substitute for real life, yet it is adequate to the purposes of man's earthly estate. Recog- nizing that this miracle may be suspect, Browning asks why it should be compared with the profane magic of Faust rather than with the divine power of Elisha, which manifested itself in an act of resurrection exactly parallel to the one Browning proposes to perform on the documents of The Old Yellow Book. In Sordello's speculations, the conversion of the public to the poet's idiom is a basis for new poetic structures, so that " Ends / Accomplished turn to means," and poetry itself becomes a new and productive reality. Similarly, in The Ring and the Book, Browning declares that " Fancy with fact is just one fact the more, answering in 17Ibid., p. 115. Michael Mason believes that Browning describes this stage as a synthesis because it has "transcendental implications." See his essay, "The Im- portance of Sordello," in The Major Victorian Poets, ed. Isobel Armstrong (London, 1969), p. 140. 4928 The Music of Lost Dynasties</page><page sequence="10">advance his later question, " Is fiction which makes fact alive, fact too? '1 8 Hence, the poetic imagination which blends with historical fact to bring it to life gains an equal status with it in actuality. In his study of Browning's Essay on Chatterton, Donald Smalley has shown that the tendency to read facts intuitionally is a persistent, and no doubt a fundamental pattern of Brown- ing's thought.'9 He prepared his essay by familiarizing himself with the facts about Chatterton's forgeries, but then imposed upon them a belief that no man of genius could be guilty of immoral behavior, which led him to the conclusion that Chatter- ton did not intend to deceive anyone. Evidence that does not fit Browning's intuitive sense of the case is ignored or argued away. This confidence in intuitive judgment and the power of his own opinions also appears in the essay on Shelley; as Smalley has demonstrated, it shapes the pattern of the argument in several of Browning's important poems, and is the method used to derive The Ring and the Book from its sources. In writing his historical poems, Browning, like his Pope, used the facts to fuel his imagination and to fill out his sense of a situation, but then depended for his final judgment on little more than an energetic mustering of deep-seated prior convictions. Though it may seem unsatisfactory as a judicial method, Browning's imaginative approach to historical facts is not very different, in principle, from practices favored by the historians of his time. After describing Leopold von Ranke's view that the character and motives of the writer must be considered if a historical document is to be evaluated fairly, Morse Peckham points out that Browning followed this principle in presenting the statements of his people in The Ring and the Book.20 He believes that Browning realized that his poem as a whole could not claim absolute truth, but should be offered as a frankly personal expres- sion, like any other document. There is, however, another, broader resemblance between Browning's historicism and that of his contemporaries. The romantic historians and quasi-historians were not satisfied with recording what was known of the past. They regarded their task 18 Complete Poetical Works, pp. 419 and 421. 9 Browning's Essay on Chatterton (Cambridge, Mass., 1948). 20 "cclistoriography and The Ring and the Book," Victorian Poetry, 6 (Autumn- Winter, 1968), 243-57. Jacob Korg 4929</page><page sequence="11">as a process of recovering what was forgotten or unknown, correcting mistaken emphases and information and restoring the past to a condition which would enable it to take part in the life of the present. This is, of course, the spirit that animated Browning in reviving the story contained in The Old Yellow Book, and his metaphor of the manufacture of the ring as a method for achieving poetic truth reflects it accurately. Sordello and The Ring and the Book were written at a time when the imagination was coming into its own as a historical tool. Carlyle, Michelet, Thierry and others were examining the past in the light of the organic analogy arising from the tradition of Herder and Hegel, which suggested that society develops according to deeply- buried patterns that can be perceived intuitively. Historians of this kind also acknowledged the importance of anomalous and irrational forces, especially the personalities of dominant men, whose psychological peculiarities were considered vital elements of the events they enacted. Hence, the task of writing history came to involve some of the problems and opportunities found in literature, and justified the historian in applying his imagination to the facts he dealt with. Even Barthold Niebuhr, who was far from being a romantic, could say: " I am an historian, for I can make a complete picture from separate fragments, and I know where the parts are missing and how to fill them up. No one believes how much of what seems to be lost can be restored.2'2 Browning believed that the poet has a faculty comparable to the historian's for linking facts coherently, the " fancy ' which acts As right through ring and ring runs the djereed And binds the loose, one bar without a break.22 As the Cantos show, Pound shared the romantic historian's conviction that the past is full of neglected but valuable begin- nings. In Guide to Kulchur he called for the exhumation of buried traditions, and for an understanding of processes which have distant origins but still operate beneath the surface of civilization. He also shared Browning's view that creation is rediscovery rather than pure invention. Daniel D. Pearlman interprets Pound's formula, " Make it new," the quotation from Confucius which one of the Chinese emperors had inscribed on his bath-tub, as an 2 Quoted in History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century by G. P. Gooch (New York, 1949), p. 19. 22 Complete Poetical Works, p. 419. 430 The Music of Lost Dynasties</page><page sequence="12">expression of the principle of renewal we have identified with Browning. He cites Pound's assertion, " Nothing is new and all good is renewal," and considers the offer of blood to Tiresias in Canto 1 to be the Cantos' first allusion to the theme of cultural rebirth.23 "For Pound," says Pearlman flatly, " creation is re- storation." 24 Pound's belief that this renewal is brought about through the poet's or historian's special insight into the past is very much like Browning's. In conveying his sense of how the mind operates, he uses an image that bears a remarkable re- semblance to Browning's unifying " djereed ": " The thread going through the holes in the coin . .. is a necessary part of a thought system.' 25 Pound's analysis of the processes leading up to the composition of " In a Station of the Metro " gives some idea of the way in which the poet's thoughts and external materials (such as his- torical records) seek each other out and merge in a finished poem. The poem itself is only two lines long: The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough. The first line defines the actuality, the second the impression it creates; the poem, as Pound explains, fixes the moment when the external fact becomes present to thought, establishing a con- tinuity between them. It might almost serve as a demonstration of pure perception as Bergson describes it in Matter and Memory, for it presents fact alive in thought, an integral phenomenon in which the objective image plays the dominant part. The histori- cal materials of the Cantos participate in a similar process. In passing into thought, they are not wholly absorbed into some inwardly-generated idea such as a myth or a dream, but maintain their original conformations. Because perception is a unified action, the feelings that take part in it by responding to the objective images acquire a validity they do not have in them- selves. This effect seems to correspond to what Browning meant by saying that " fiction which makes fact alive" acquires the authority of fact itself. In an analysis which has some relevance to the Cantos, Robert Langbaum has described The Ring and the Book as an attempt 23 The Barb of Time (New York, 1969), p. 37. 24 Ibid., p. 26. 25 Guide to Kutchur, p. 188. Jacob Korg 431</page><page sequence="13">to show that mythic patterns embodying enduring truths can be seen even in the confusion of actual historical events. Langbaum feels that Browning has succeeded in making the Andromeda myth which lurks just below the surface of the poem come alive by exposing its pattern in the subconscious thoughts of his characters. The Andromeda story was particularly mean- ingful to Browning because he felt that his own marriage was a re- enactment of it. But we are not convinced that he has been fair to the facts in shaping the events of his poem according to it, or that the conclusions suggested are timeless truths rather than his own moral views. It appears, from Langbaum's discussion of the prob- lem, that Browning's attempt at myth in The Ring and tube Book was made difficult by two factors: the private value of the myth he used, and his belief in progress, a belief which calls the con- tinuing validity of mythical patterns into question.26 J. Hillis Miller's assessment of the mythic qualities of The Ring and the Book arrives at a comparable conclusion. According to Miller, Browning believed that ultimate truth is locked into every concrete particular, but that it is inaccessible to ordinary percep- tion. In The Ring and the Book he tried to overcome this limita- tion by surrounding a specific fragment of the past with a circle of interpretation, thus completing the possibilities of perception, so that the situation can be seen as it is, and the truth concealed in it can be shadowed forth. But Miller feels that this revelation never comes, and that the poem rises only as far as the recog- nition that man cannot gain God's vision and must be content with his own.27 Browning acknowledges that a work of art cannot share the creative power of God, but Repeats God's process in man's due degree, Attaining man's proportionate result.28 26 Robert Langbaum, " Browning and the Question of Myth," in The Modern Spirit (New York, 1970), pp. 83-84. In aligning the Cantos with Browning in a way that emphasizes its historical thrust, I am differing to some extent with numerous inter- preters who believe that it moves in the direction of mythic expression. Two state- ments of this view are Clark Emery's Ideas Into Action (Coral Gables, Florida, 1958) and Daniel D. Pearlman's The Barb of Time. I believe that Donald Davie accurately defines the relation of myth and history in the poem when he says that Pound is " not only keeping a calculated proportion between history-material and myth-material but balancing one against the other artistically, by contriving parallels between them " (Ezra Pound: The Poet as Sculptor, p. 214). 27 J. Hillis Miller, The Disappearance of God (New York, 1965), pp. 148-56. 28 Complete Poetical Works, p. 421. 432 The Music of Lost Dynasties</page><page sequence="14">When it is treated in this spirit, the past bears the imprint of both time and personality instead of attaining the permanence and anonymity of myth. The Cantos have the same general movement toward myth, and are prevented from achieving it by the same obstacles as those which appear in Browning: a fidelity to historical data, and a reliance upon a personal interpretation of them. The figures and episodes both poets borrowed from history approach archetypal significance. But they do not quite reach this con- dition because the poems are controlled by the conviction that truth is inseparable from fact, that a mastery of actuality is a precondition for insight into the transcendent, that permanent, general truths can be sought only through the particular and contingent. Their historical materials have vividness and au- thenticity, but do not acquire the universal synecdoche of myth. It is true that myths are a major component of the Cantos; in a letter to his father explaining the plan of the poem, Pound spoke of the moment of metamorphosis, "bust thru from quotidien [sic] into 'divine or permanent world' Gods, etc." 29 But this was to be only one of three kinds of time represented in the poem. Pound's model for it, according to Yeats' report, was the Tura- Del Cossa frescoes in the Hall of the Months of the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara. These frescoes originally consisted of twelve vertical panels, each representing a month, and each divided horizontally into three scenes. The upper scene shows a " Triumph " of the deity who is the patron of the month, such as Vulcan, Ceres or Jupiter; the second level shows the appropri- ate sign of the zodiac together with three figures of zodiacal demons associated with ten particular days or degrees of the zodiac. The lowest level shows everyday activities from con- temporary life, such as hunting, racing and the reception of ambassadors, often in the setting of the palazzo itself, and in- volving Duke Borso d'Este, the contemporary ruler of Ferrara. The whole immense work is a celebration of the theme of time, showing it in three forms, the archetypal, associated with divini- ties; the fixed, associated with zodiacal demons; the temporary and passing, associated with the scenes of daily life. Pound said that he intended to mingle these with each other. and the mythic, the historical and the quotidian continue to 29 Letters, p. 210 (11 April 1927). Jacob Korg 433</page><page sequence="15">appear side by side in Thrones, the latest group of Cantos to be published, as they do throughout. The indispensable elements among them are the experiences authenticated either by Pound's observation or historical record, events having the weight of actuality, which may be illuminated by mythic parallels. In discussing the relative importance of myth and history in the poem, Donald Davie has said, ". . . it is the basic assumption of the Cantos that we have no right to our religious apprehensions unless we have taken the historical evidence into consideration." 3 Davie's reading of the Cantos corresponds very well with the spirit of Browning's assertion that while a poet may aim at the subjective and the spiritual, nevertheless, " the world is not to be learned and thrown aside, but reverted to and relearned." Both poems are efforts to perceive absolute truths in the way specified by Browning, through studying their embodiments in the forms offered by history. When the efforts fail, the poems miss the mythic vision, but they fall back into a history that has been thoroughly re-lived, enacting, as Miller puts it, an ironic version of Mircea Eliade's eternal return. There are good reasons for this result. According to Eliade, the primitive consciousness which is the source of myth interprets experiences in terms of their relation to absolute reality. The value of human activities lies, not in their practical effectiveness, but in their reflection of some metaphysical archetype: Their meaning, their value, are not connected with their crude physi- cal datum but with their property of reproducing a primordial act, of repeating a mythic example. . . . In the particulars of his conscious behavior, the " primitive," the archaic man, acknowledges no act which has not been previously posited and lived by someone else, some other being who was not a man. What he does has been done before. His life is the ceaseless repetition of gestures initiated by others."' In spite of their mythic ambitions, Browning's historical poems and the Cantos rely for the treatment of the past on faculties which Eliade rules out of the primitive experience of time, namely faith and memory. The qualities of mind they use in their conquest of time belong to the post-Hebraic sensibility which Eliade describes as the view that time is linear and progressive, but saved from chaos because it is the expression of a divine will. 3 Davie, p. 208.

For Pound, on the other hand, the survival of a meaningful past depends squarely upon individual consciousness: nothing matters but the quality of the affection- in the end-that has carved the trace in the mind dove sta memoria 32 and What thou lovest well remains, the rest is dross What thou lov'st well shall not be reft from thee What thou lov'st well is thy true heritage. ...33 This is the voice of a historical, rather than a mythic conscious- ness. It expresses Pound's purpose of defending a cultural herit- age, as Browning had defended a spiritual one, against what Eliade calls " the terror of history," the fear that the suffering and destruction witnessed by time cannot be justified by the accomplishments of the past. The reinterpretation of history he carries on in the Cantos is an attempt to redeem the past, to transform it into a source of positive value, and to link it to the message of his poetry. It is an effort that corresponds to the first stage of Sordello's poetic, the envaluement of history as a pre- liminary to composition, and to the conviction of romantic his- torians that the recorded facts cannot articulate the truths of history without the vitalizing power of the imagination. The principle of renewal that operates in the historical poetry of Browning and Pound suggests that their notion of time is not primitive or mythic, but corresponds to the modern one Poulet calls " continuous creation," with some nineteenth century sur- vivals.34 Both seem to have the modern sense that each moment is a relatively independent cell of time, free enough of the deter- mining power of the past to engender change and innovation. This view implies discontinuity, and something of the sort is 3a Canto 76, The Cantos, p. 35. The pagination of this volume is irregular.

Jacob Korg 435</page><page sequence="17">involved in their feeling that parts of the past can grow moribund, though they do not quite die away. Their tendency to ignore conventional patterns of history, and to turn instead to neglected pockets of time is a way of resisting the threat of discontinuity. Their efforts to revive these, to deliberately create continuities that history itself has somehow failed to establish, are reversions to the time-sense of the romantic period with its proto-evolution- ary sense of organic modulation and survival. The reader is forever encountering strange new growths in the more or less familiar terrain Browning and Pound take him into, such as the virtues of Malatesta, the democratic tendencies of Sordello, and the intuitive religion of the Pope. These are, of course, trans- plantations from a present that is free to innovate, seeds of new time inserted into the old ground of our conventional knowledge of the past. The procedure is odd, and it is not to be confused with the naive insensitivity to history that produces anachro- nisms. The conventional reading of the past is rejected in order to make room for a newly-devised one. The past is infiltrated with the present, in the interest of exhibiting the integrating power of poetic vision. The resulting readings of history, vaguely CC progressive " and Evangelical in Browning's poems, and tradi- tionalist and authoritarian in the Cantos, have, of course, caused much critical dissatisfaction. Donald Davie has concluded that Pound's performance is so disastrous that it has disqualified poetry as a medium of historical consciousness for some time to come.35 It is perhaps unfortunate that the healthy self-distrust Pound expressed in the 1917 version of Canto 1 should have disappeared as the Cantos developed. In Canto 89, for example, Pound shows that he has undertaken a project exactly like the first stage of Sordello's poetic, that of fixing the moral significance of broad ranges of history: To know the histories t to know good from evil And know whom to trust.36 (shu jing-" through books ") This confidence in intuitive judgment has its dogmatic quality, but it is rooted in the romantic historical consciousness, and is, like Browning's, not without support, in principle, from con- 3 Davie, p. 9244. Canto 89, The Cantos, p. 50. 436 The Music of Lost Dynasties</page><page sequence="18">temporaries concerned with the question of validity in history. Some historians of Pound's time advocated methods that can only be described as literary. For example, Carl Becker, in his paper, " What are Historical Facts? " (1926) attacked the notion that historical knowledge can be definitive, and argued that the materials with which the historian works are as relative and unverifiable as those of literature. Historical facts are not irre- ducible units, but composites of innumerable small details im- possible to record, ". . . and if we had some one, say James Joyce, to know and relate all these facts, it would no doubt require a book of 794 pages (i. e., Ulysses) to present this one fact that Caesar crossed the Rubicon." 3 Such facts are not specific, says Becker, but only symbols standing for scraps of information which depend, in turn, on larger symbolic construc- tions for their meaning. Ernst Cassirer supports Pound's intuitiveness even more im- mediately when he reminds us that the facts of history cannot be recovered from such sources as documents and monuments but only inferred. These materials are meaningful only in terms of their general backgound which is, in turn, a product of infer- ences drawn from indirect evidence. "Ideal reconstruction, not empirical observation, is the first step in historical knowledge." 38 But the historian's interest in material remains is, after all, only intermediate; his real interest is the feelings and ideas that can be read from them, and he therefore sees them as vital evidences of the spiritual life of the past. Cassirer might be describing the method of the Cantos, with its assemblage of documents, myths, anecdotes, quotations and other fragments embedded into a single fabric when he says, " History is the attempt to fuse together all these disiecta membra, the scattered limbs of the past and to synthesize them and mold them into a new shape." 39 Since it consists only incidentally of verifiable facts, history cannot achieve objectivity through neutrality; it requires the imagination to see the facts within a human context. " Like language or art, history is fundamentally anthropomorphic. . . . it is a form of self-knowledge." 40 37 Quoted in A History of Historical Writing by Harry Elmer Barnes (Norman, Oklahoma, 1937), pp. 9267-8.

Jacob Korg 487</page><page sequence="19">If Becker and Cassirer are right, history is as legitimate a subject of imaginative treatment as any other, and the poetry that deals with it runs the same risks as all poetry that tries to express personal vision through externals. But the strain is more severe as we have seen, because historical facts are in the public domain. While the Romantic poets preferred imagination to material reality, the problem of the relation between the two became acute in the post-Romantic generation to which Browning belonged. Fearing that the Romantic poets had lost touch with reality by immersing themselves in feeling, poets and critics tried to correct the balance. John Stuart Mill in his " Two Kinds of Poetry" distinguished between poets of nature, who follow their emotions, and poets of culture, who are guided by ideas, in order to make the point that the philosopher-poet, whose capacity for feeling is combined with judgment and logic, is bound to be superior. He praised Tennyson's early poems because they at- tempted to achieve coherence by combining the actual and the imaginary under the control of a single impulse.41 Another re- viewer of Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, praised both his vivid presentation of objects, and " the peculiar skill with which he holds all of them fused . . . in a medium of strong emotion." 42 As his comment on "In a Station of the Metro" shows, Pound believed in a balance of this kind, and in the control of a unifying emotion. The view that objects can speak for them- selves, which was advanced by W. C. Williams and Gertrude Stein among others, and the dogmatic objectivity of the " ready- made" introduced into the graphic arts by Marcel Duchamp were not parts of his modernism. His little poem, " L'Art, 1910" satirized the tendency toward immaculately impersonal obser- vation: Green arsenic smeared on an egg-white cloth, Crushed strawberries! Come, let us feast our eyes. L. S. Dembo has said of the moder attempt to achieve objec- tivity and immediacy: "It is problematic whether radical theories of perception do not in fact come full circle to a kind ""Mill's "Two Kinds of Poetry" and his review of Tennyson's poems appear in Mill's Literary Essays ed. Edward Alexander (Indianapolis, 1967). "' Quoted from Arthur Hallam's " On Some of the Characteristics of Modern Poetry and on the Lyrical Poems of Alfred Tennyson," in " Tennyson and Picturesque Poetry" by H. M.

Anticonceptualism . . . resolves itself into a philosophic idealism in which the perceiver, through his conscious- ness, becomes the determining element of the world he per- ceives." 4 Browning and Pound grasped this paradox clearly. For them the participation of the artist's consciousness was not only unavoidable, it was the crucial element in the perception of reality, and they had no difficulty in extending this view to historical fact. Historical truth was not a predetermined entity awaiting discovery and mechanical transcription, but something to be realized through active creation. For them, as for Cassirer, history was a subject of "ideal reconstruction," a medium of self-expression, a landscape of the mind capable of receiving and confirming the insights brought to it by the imagination. But history which is no more than the historian's self-knowl- edge has no special claim to the reader's attention. Whatever permanence and universality the historical elements in the poems of Browning and Pound may have, they gain not as myths or personal testaments, but as constituents of works of art. The renewal the two poets undertook was partly, to be sure, a matter of changing the existing state of knowledge about the past, but it also involved the more radical transformation of shifting materials from literal or extensional modes to the symbolic one. At the end of The Ring and the Book, Browning, foreseeing that his interpretation of the facts may not gain universal assent, hopes that he has succeeded in expressing truth in another way: it is the glory and good of Art, That Art remains the one way possible Of speaking truth, to mouths like mine at least. . . .Art may tell a truth Obliquely, do the thing shall breed the thought So write a book shall mean beyond the facts, Suffice the eye and save the soul beside.44 As actualities, historical figures and episodes have one kind of meaning. But as parts of such a symbolic structure as a poem, they " mean beyond the facts," acquiring the freer, more general- ized, emotive and somewhat enigmatic kind of meaning peculiar to symbols. They undergo what might be called a renewal into form, deriving additional import from the place they occupy in the meaningful design of the poem. Browning and Pound hoped 43 Conceptions of Reality in Modern American Poetry (Berkeley, 1966), p. 6. 44 Complete Poetical Works, p. 601. Jacob Korg 439</page><page sequence="21">that this would augment rather than cancel their meaning as facts. Pound's remark, in his letter to Margaret Anderson, that the writing of his historical poem was a way of hearing " music " shows that he believed in the co-existence of the two kinds of meaning. This intention is clear from the very beginning of his work on the poem, for it was always weighted with history, and it was always called Cantos. As if to dispel the traditional skepticism about this combina- tion, each of the two poets devised an image for the poetic process which shows how the actual can be assimilated into the symbolic without forfeiting its " truth." These images are strikingly similar to each other. In the metaphor of the ring which he uses to tell how The Ring and The Book was derived from the reports and depositions of an old trial, Browning explains that the pure gold of historical truth, as it was found in The Old Yellow Book, is mingled with the alloy of the poet's "fancy" to produce a medium firm, enough to hold the shape given it by the goldsmith. After the ring has been worked, it is bathed in an acid which dissolves the alloy, and turns it into pure gold, or pure truth, again. Pound's image for artistic creation, the rose in the steel dust, occurs frequently in his prose writings and in the Cantos. In his first reasonably full exposition of it, the one found in an essay of 1913, Pound explains that when a magnet is held to the bottom of a dish on which steel filings are placed, the filings respond to the attraction by ranging themselves in a circle; thus an unseen force brings order out of chaos. The connection be- tween form and renewal in Pound's image is made overt in Guide to Kulchur: The forma, the immortal concetto, the concept, the dynamic form which is like the rose pattern driven into the dead filings by the magnet.... Thus the forma, the concept rises from death. .45 In both images, the recovered facts leap into meaning because they become the constituent elements of a symbolic form. The fact that it is the same form, the circle, emblem of completion and tranquillity, suggests that both poets believed that the inarticu- late turmoil of history can be redeemed through the ordering power of art.
