<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nintendo and Telos: Will You Ever Reach the End? Peter Buse 5W e live in the "cybernetic age." The presence of machines and technological devices in our culture is so pervasive that it no longer makes sense to talk of technology as separate from the gen- eral sphere of human activity. In The Soft-Machine: Cybernetic Fiction, David Porush says we need look no further than today's children to find a telling barometer of the shift into this new age. Here is the sinister picture he paints of the local video arcade where the offspring of the new age are to be found: In their off hours, their fingers play over the controls of video games and "micros," their faces lit up by the light of CRT screens, bodies moving in rhythm to a complex feedback mechanism, eyes, minds and hands locked in a looped circuit of reflex and reward with a more-than-mere-game. In the video arcade, the machines are united by a single principle: ultimately, hardware defeats exhaustible and vulnerable or- gans and intelligences grown in flesh and housed in bone. Next time you're there, watch the players hitched to their boxes and ask who controls what. Or what controls whom (1-2) ) 1996 by Cultural Critique. Fall 1996. 0882-4371/96/$5.00. 163</page><page sequence="2">164 Peter Buse Parents, it seems, should no longer ask where their children are, but what they are. In any case, the rapid advent of Sega and Nin- tendo "home entertainment systems" ensures the datedness of Por- ush's "futuristic" scenario, with video arcades sadly vacant and go- ing the way of the Amstrad: cybernetic obsolescence. In the past five to ten years, the video game context has altered radically and vid-kids (still primarily boys, if i-D magazine and innumerable other sources are to be trusted) can be found sublimating their aggression in the safety of their bedrooms and TV rooms instead of lurking in dark and dingy arcades. Although The Soft-Machine leaves video games after the dra- matic vision of the arcade, going on to discuss novelists like Barth, Pynchon, Calvino, and Coover, the passage just quoted is represen- tative of Porush's main thesis: cybernetic fiction is pitted against science in a contest where "literature actually has the means to meet science on its own territory" (373). Porush claims to be ush- ering in a new epistemology, attempting to break down the opposi- tion that separates "human" and "machine," but in doing so he clings to a very old paradigm, maintaining a wariness toward a cold hard science that erodes our "humaneness." More specifically, Por- ush describes an ideal "postmodern science" that allows for the human element in science (377). This is a bit like the pop psychol- ogy idea of men recognizing their feminine side and women recog- nizing their masculine side. It maintains the categories as discrete, but says they can exist harmoniously within a single subject. This is not the place to re-rehearse the critique of the Enlight- enment subject. Suffice it to say that Porush's ominous question about "who controls what or what controls whom" in the arcade invokes a potentially autonomous human consciousness engaged in a struggle with technology; and in the case of video games, tech- nology appears to have the upper hand. To posit the relationship between technology and its users as a conflict for control amounts to inserting an old debate about free will versus determinism into a contemporary frame. Such a frame reduces discussion of tech- nology to the absolutes of technophiles singing the praises of useful new tools and technophobes who cite Chaplin's Modern Times as the most telling commentary on the dehumanizing capacity of the mechanical age. With the introduction of such a limiting frame, Porush excludes any possible analysis of video games in terms of</page><page sequence="3">Nintendo and Telos 165 desire and subjectivity. For him, the vexed problem is whether we control the machines or whether they control us, when he could be asking what the implications of technology are for the subject. I think Porush is right: video games are potentially revealing indica- tors of a paradigm shift, but I would like to reorient the mode of analysis. Rather than thinking of video games as machines with manipulative capacities, "minds of their own," it might be more useful to see them as narrative machines, providing for their play- ers stories in which to participate. Participation, as a term, has the advantage of skirting the bounds of both free will and determin- ism, and should be taken to have at least two meanings here: first, the literal playing of the game, and second, the "enunciation" of the game/narrative by the viewer/player. What is so fascinating about video games is the possibility for overlap in these two mean- ings. In the following discussion I first attempt to trace and ac- count for that overlap and then try to place video games within a wider cultural context. Doing Things with Video Games Thinking of video games in terms of narrative may seem like a paradoxical operation, an encounter between an old-fashioned concept and a thoroughly modern phenomenon. Paradoxical or not, video games without fail deploy some variety of skeleton plot, usually culled from the adventure genre, and indeed, Marsha Kinder has fruitfully explored, in Playing with Power, their insertion into the wider signifying network of children's entertainment, in- cluding film and Saturday morning television. But the structure of video game narratives also merits closer attention on its own. A trip to the (abandoned) local (British) arcade yields four random examples: Streetfighter II, AeroFighters, Seibu-Cup Soccer, and Under- cover Cops. The emphasis on combat and competition is not as ran- dom as the choice, because video and computer games generally thrive on narratives based on belligerence. Streetfighter II involves hand-to-hand combat between various colorful characters in exotic locales, ranging from an American airbase to a temple in India and a street in China. A similar international flavor predominates in AeroFighters, in which lone pilots from the U.S.A., Sweden, Japan,</page><page sequence="4">166 Peter Buse or the U.K. engage in air battles with the ultimate aim of destroy- ing the enemy's base.' The soccer game uses as its narrative the World Cup and the player has the choice of one of the globe's lead- ing sides. Undercover Cops, meanwhile, is, like Streetfighter II, a hand- to-hand combat game, but this time the plot involves tracking down and eliminating uncharismatic drug dealers. The games all go to some length to provide background information on the plot scenario or on the traits of the characters. In Undercover Cops, then, the opening credits of the game explain that a plague of drugs is ravaging the city and it is up to the special drug squad (that's you: the player) to squash the ring; in AeroFighters, names and faces, not to mention nationalities, are assigned to the choices of pilot.2 None of these narratives are particularly remarkable: innu- merable similar examples could be found in more elaborated and expanded forms in war comics and Kung-Fu movies, and analyzing their aggressive project would be neither difficult nor particularly illuminating.3 Equally, video game narratives are predictable and depressing when it comes to sexual politics: with a few notable ex- ceptions, like Tetris and other nongendered games, they rather crudely reproduce the worst-case scenario of patriarchal gender relations.4 What is remarkable about the games is not so much the stories they tell, or even the way in which they tell them, but the actual process of telling and reading or, alternatively, of playing. The notion of "playing a narrative" is not entirely satisfactory, but is preferable to "reading," because, as Paul Virilio says when he comments on the speed of propaganda transmission, "Reading im- plies time for reflection, a slowing-down" (5). Video games acceler- ate narrative beyond any possibility of "reading" in a traditional sense. They do for narrative what the microwave does for cooking. In Story and Situation, Ross Chambers identifies two major strands of inquiry in contemporary narratology: on the one hand, the examination of narrative structure, and on the other, analysis of the discursive presentation of events. These two forms of study yield, respectively, a "grammar" and a "rhetoric" of narrative (4). In the case of video games, ascertaining a fine grammar would involve labeling elements common to all games, such as the hero figure, the progression through stages or levels, the scoring system, and so on. Analyzing the rhetoric of a game, on the other hand, would entail examining the basic narrative ("story") in relation to</page><page sequence="5">Nintendo and Telos 167 its mode of presentation ("discourse"), that is, the visual, or more precisely, graphic, format. However, in addition to these two criti- cal approaches to narrative, Chambers suggests a third, largely ne- glected, possibility for inquiry: the function of telling. Claiming that "literary criticism and theory have paid little attention to the performative function of storytelling," he proposes a narratology concerned primarily with the "event" of storytelling (4). Chambers draws on the speech-act theory elaborated by J. L. Austin, who dis- tinguished, in How to Do Things with Words, between constative ut- terances, which simply convey information, and performative ut- terances, which "do things." The same division can be applied to the utterance of narratives. Each telling or reading of a "story" is not simply the safe transmission of a content, but also a perfor- mance. Video games attempt to collapse the distinction between nar- rative as story and narrative as performance. In Chambers's dis- cussion of nineteenth-century short stories, he foregrounds story- telling as performance, but in a video game narrative there is no evident narrator or storyteller. In a video game the playing process both constitutes the narrative and "performs" the text. The plot proceeds only by dint of the player participating in the game, bringing the main protagonist to life, and directing it/him/her through the hazardous fictional world. If Pac-Man is a story about a round yellow creature which makes its way around mazes eating little dots and avoiding nasty creatures, then that story is realized only when the playing enacts the situation. And each performance is different, elaborating a different plot, with Pac-Man following different patterns in the maze and living for shorter or longer du- rations. A poor player might last only twenty seconds; another story might be abruptly ended due to unnecessary risks on the part of the protagonist; yet another might play for hours on end. But this is not some highly refined form of reader-response whereby a skeleton plot is left to the whims of the players' expressivity. Success in a video game demands a rigorous interpretative process: not a hermeneutics aimed at unveiling the truth, but a rapid scanning of specific signs and situations prompting the best possible "moves," which in turn guarantee the continuation of the story. How, then, do these video games differ from games like chess, or even Monop- oly for that matter? Those games also require interpretative acu-</page><page sequence="6">168 Peter Buse men and a selection of "moves" that can range from brilliant to disastrous. The element of speed has already been touched upon, and certainly board games do not require the conditioning of re- flexes and high levels of hand-eye coordination. There is at least one other important distinction to be made between the two game forms: in one the player faces a board and another player, while in the other the player faces a screen.5 The presence of the screen inevitably suggests that video games be submitted to the discover- ies of film theory. Ross Chambers emphasizes the need "not simply to read texts in situation (which is inevitable) but also to read, in the texts, the situation that they produce" (4). Such reading occurs in film theory, particularly as elaborated in Screen, which dedicated much energy in the 1970s to questions of modes of address and how cinematic "texts" produce for the spectator a position (or positions) from which to "enounce" or "utter" the film. It seems to me that Cham- bers's interest lies in very much the same questions about narrative, albeit from within a different theoretical framework; whereas Story and Situation draws on speech-act theory, the work done in Screen sets out from theories of ideology and psychoanalysis. Both approaches are germane to this project, which hopes to chart the configurations of both performance and subjectivity in video games. A speculative reading of video games through classical film theory would probably proceed by way of the player's Imaginary. Questions of the spectator's Imaginary investment in the cinema are most famously addressed by Christian Metz in such essays as "The Imaginary Signifier," where he extrapolates from the work of Jacques Lacan on the mirror-stage. Lacan memorably argues in "The Mirror-Stage" that the infant perceiving itself in the mirror is "caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality" (4). The perceiving proto-subject finds security in its stable image and an attendant object world, but is simultaneously alienated from itself as it identifies with an imaginary object in the mirror image. Metz reorients Lacan's theory and applies it to the cinema, claiming that the screen is like a mirror in which "every- thing may come to be projected," except for one essential thing: the spectator's own body (48). Since there is no body to identify with, Metz reasons that the spectator may identify with a character, but that above all, "the spectator identifies with himself [sic], with him-</page><page sequence="7">Nintendo and Telos 169 self as pure act of perception" (51). Here Metz invokes the scopic drive, concluding that the spectator achieves a position of pleni- tude, of power within the field of vision, by identifying with the camera, which presumably can see everyone and freeze and con- trol the object world. Despite the obvious difference that there is no literal camera in video games, we can still bring Metz's arguments to bear on them. It little matters how images are provided to the subject: it is the very provision of images that is important. We might say that the video graphics simulate the activity of the camera, or, so as not to give priority to one technique over another, we could equally say that the activity of the camera has the capacity to simulate the generation of computer graphics. They both frame time and space within a limited field of vision. In any case, the kind of projection of interest here is psychic and not cinematic. As far as the Lacanian infant is concerned, Jacqueline Rose explains, "The early emphasis by Lacan on Gestalt, on the child's ability to represent its body to itself, is ... not simply a notion of some comforting illusory poise, but is directly linked at this stage in his theory to its ability to con- trol its world in a physical sense" (172). The mirror confirms the proto-subject's own motor coordination, by sending back a falsely totalizing image of a fragmented and incoordinate body. The struc- tural relation here is metonymic (image: part; body: whole), and all video games employ this very same screen device, providing the player with an icon, which has a metonymic function in relation to the player's body. The player manipulates the icon on the screen with a joystick and/or various buttons, completing the circuit of specularity. Following Metz's argument, the player sees herself or himself seeing herself or himself and, through this actual physical participation, gains control over the physical world as well as the image one. Video games, it seems, incarnate the perfection of the mirror, inserting the subject into a narrative in which she or he sees herself or himself projected as the hero and potential master. This happy and insouciant subject, linked merrily to an imago machine, is, of course, a caricature, and headed for a fall. As it turns out, the seeing subject in a Lacanian schema never achieves plenitude and is doomed to be duped, not satisfied. When Lacan treats the gaze, he speaks of the subject "who apprehends some- thing that is one of the essential correlates of consciousness in its relation to representation, and which is designated as I see myself</page><page sequence="8">170 Peter Buse seeing myself . . . correlative with that fundamental mode to which we referred in the Cartesian cogito, by which the subject appre- hends himself as thought" (Four Concepts 80). But Lacan dismisses the specular claims of the cogito and refers instead to "the illusion of the consciousness of seeing oneself seeing oneself " (83). The cogito is undermined by the intervention of desire in the "domain of seeing" (85). In Sexuality in the Field of Vision, Jacqueline Rose criticizes Metz's formulations of the spectator's imaginary identifications precisely on the question of desire, which always disrupts pleni- tude or satisfaction. Rose points out that in Lacan, as well as Freud, identification is only temporary and never complete, instead slip- ping constantly. She wants to emphasize "the presence or insistence of desire inside these very forms which are designed to reproduce or guarantee the specular illusion itself (image, screen, spectator)" (190). Even if the player experiences a moment of jubilation at the control wielded over the little yellow Pac-Man, that moment is predicated on the possibility of another such moment (the next dot eaten, the next level cleared). And at the end of the day, even if you imagine you have won the simulated World Cup of Seibu-Cup Soccer, you are still playing a game designed to be lost. This is not the gambler's complaint of the rigged table that impairs the fair- ness of the odds. Fairness is not at issue here. The inevitable loss is the condition of the desire set up by the game format. However, this desire is set up along the axis of narrative enunciation, and not necessarily within the scopic regime. Indeed, as Gillian Skirrow has observed, video games may in fact constitute a "break with television's traditional role as world-window" and the screen as su- turing device, because they "unhook the aerial" (121). Therefore, in order to begin to understand the movements of this desire, it is best to leave film theory and return again to the narrative. Will You Ever Reach the End? In its glossy, visually dazzling, and aggressive adverts, the Nin- tendo corporation, as represented by a booming and scornful voice, tempts prospective buyers of a new video game with the tan- talizing slogan, "The Ultimate Challenge Has Arrived." Following</page><page sequence="9">Nintendo and Telos 171 this in dramatic lettering, as the rhetorical coup de grace, is the challenge, "Will You Ever Reach the End?" After a suitable pause additional letters join the word "End" to form "Super Nintendo." In equally technically mind-boggling and fast-paced advertise- ments, the competition, Sega, offers its incentive: "To Be This Good Takes AGES." The final moments of each advert see Sega pulling a page from the Nintendo guide to creative advertising (or is it the other way around?), with the "AGES" spinning on its axis to reveal the source of this Ultimate Challenge. A few things be- come clear from these simple, up-front visual prompts.6 The narra- tive on offer in these video games is not going to be an easy read. The first time you play it, you will quickly lose your icon, or charac- ter, or "life," or what you will. This first loss may be frustrating or upsetting, and the frustration may be compounded if you keep on dying at a tricky part of the game. But do not worry if you cannot get past a particularly nasty monster; after all, you can always go back and start again, and if you repeat the process enough times, you will eventually defeat that monster and move ever closer to that elusive End. Whatever you do, don't give up: you can die a thousand deaths before you do that. When you are skillful enough, but only then, you will attain that triumphant moment of comple- tion, having mastered every danger and trap in the long narrative adventure, and the sweet taste of victory will more than compen- sate for the time, trouble, and struggle. Bask in the glory for awhile, tell all your friends (who still haven't reached even Level 4), and if you get bored, don't worry, your parents are an easy touch for a new game. The story just recounted is not a new one. It goes back at least as far as 1920 when Freud told it in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. That text arose from his inability to account for the repetition com- pulsion marked in some of his patients, a compulsion that flew in the face of the dominance of the pleasure principle previously thought to be supreme. Intervening in the domain of pleasure is the reality principle, which "demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction and the temporary toleration of un- pleasure as a step on the long indirect road to pleasure" (278). This psychic economy of the detour acts as a device for managing trauma. A subject will unconsciously repeat a painful experience, not for pleasure evidently, but so as to master that experience: "by</page><page sequence="10">172 Peter Buse repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took an active part. These efforts might be put down to an instinct for mas- tery that was acting independently of whether the memory was in itself pleasurable or not" (285). Freud then extrapolates from this account of the Fort/Da game to attribute to humanity "an urge ... to restore an earlier state of things" (308). This is the infamous death drive, which has it that "the aim of all life is death" (311). However, we are not forever throwing ourselves off cliffs because of the prevalence of the reality principle (or is it the pleasure prin- ciple?),7 which causes "the still surviving substance to diverge ever more widely from its original course of life and to make even more complicated detours before reaching its aim of death. These circu- itous paths to death . . ." (311). In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud makes certain formula- tions about deferral, delay, and the impossibility of presence, but then he relays his discoveries into a metaphysical conclusion. In his close and extended reading of Beyond in The Post-Card, Jacques Derrida suspends Freud's conclusions and puts them off slightly longer, emphasizing the double deferral of the pleasure principle, which "submits itself, provisionally and to a certain extent, to its own lieutenant" (288), and "the enigmatic death drive which ap- pears, disappears, appears to disappear, appears in order to disap- pear" (262). In the "Envoi" section of The Post-Card, Derrida re- writes Beyond in terms of postal systems, those networks designed to send letters to their proper destinations, but by way of relays and way stations where the letters could, and do, go astray. The post links destination to identity, but identity (reciprocity, the self- same) is always sent down the trail of desire instead (192). A postal coordinator who would master and monitor very post-box and of- fice and carrier, would always be one step away from that mastery. Mastery, like death, has no fixed address. The parallels between Freud's paper and the video game- playing process can be readily recognized, and Marsha Kinder has already made the connection with Beyond the Pleasure Principle, or rather, she reads video games through Peter Brooks's version of Freud's "master plot" in Readingfor the Plot: players are constantly threatened by short circuiting and pre- mature deaths (which indeed are called "deaths"), while their</page><page sequence="11">Nintendo and Telos 173 compulsive repetitions are rewarded (for this is the only means of advancing in the game). Spatialized as detours and warp zones, the narrative elaborations serve to postpone and inten- sify the final gratification: mastering the game (Kinder 111). In Kinder's version though, the result is a somewhat rosier outlook on play, narrative, and repetition, where the tensions between real- ity and pleasure principles are resolved and Eros and Thanatos exist in a complementarity they never achieve in Freud's text. Of the narrative-play process she describes, she concludes, "Such a structure is bound to lead to cognitive development, for, like drink- ing milk or doing daily aerobics, the compulsive consumption of video games appears to accelerate growth" (111). Comparison of aerobics and video games must give either one or the other a bad name, and as for milk, one would not have to look far to find a parent or equivalent moral arbiter to protest that games constitute something more toxic, or at least less wholesome. What Kinder leaves out is the darker side of Freud's paper; for one thing, a trauma is the necessary starting kernel for compul- sive repetition, and games produce for their players that trauma. Furthermore, "mastery," whether achieved or not, is never pur- sued without costs. As Kinder herself is quick to emphasize, video games have always courted and supported a masculinist culture (103-8); and it is safe to say that mastery has traditionally been a masculine preoccupation. If the games do offer and expect mas- tery from players, this certainly squares with the charge frequently made that video game playing not only is a predominantly male practice but is gendered masculine. Leslie Haddon has usefully charted the development of video games as a male preserve, from their prehistory in the all-male MIT computer labs of the 1960s to the arcade culture of the 1970s and early 1980s. He argues that the insertion of video games into an arcade setting meant they were "slotted into an existing nexus of social relations" with mar- ginalized girls (61) and adds that the "coin-op context may have contributed to the development of the games as 'masculine texts', but it also structured games playing as a collective male activity" (65). However, the masculinity cultivated in arcades must be quali- fied as ambivalent at best. Gone are the days of the Tom Brown or Boy Scout-style entry into the symbolic order, for video games</page><page sequence="12">174 Peter Buse drag growing boys away from their natural healthy habitat-the sporting fields-and into the dark arcade where all other muscles atrophy at the expense of wrist and retina. The development of a youth male culture around video and computer games may not constitute an erosion of the masculine, but it at least signals a re- configuration of gender around technology. In any case, is it really valid to claim, as Kinder does, that players achieve "the final gratification: mastery of the game"? In the video game situation, mastery through repetition is indeed on offer. In fact, the games not only offer mastery to the player but demand it; but it is a mastery that is always just delayed or de- ferred. It is important to note in this context a minor but signifi- cant difference between the video game played in the arcade and the one played at home. Although the playing paradigm remains for the most part consistent in both situations, one difference is striking: an arcade game is interminable, the home game termina- ble, at least at a superficial level. Nintendo and Sega games both offer the lure of "completing" all the levels of one of their games, of reaching the end, whereas in the arcade, there are an infinite number of levels to play. In the old-style arcade game with the interminable narrative, the lure consists in reaching yet another level or stage of the game, with outright "victory" over the machine impossible. Mastery, then, is understood as only temporary in the arcade, and the challenge consists in getting as much playing time out of one coin as possible; as in Freud's Beyond, the player repeats persistently the drive toward ending the game but perversely and simultaneously does the utmost to prolong the struggle, and to de- fer and delay the end. Computer games played in the home originally deployed the same strategy of interminable narratives, until Sega and Nintendo corporations transformed game playing with terminable game narratives. For instance, Sonic the Hedgehog, released in 1991, seems potentially endless to the uninitiated and unskillful, but in fact it is possible to "conquer" the game, to "reach the End," at least after playing the game many times over and discovering and avoiding progressively more traps and dangers the second, third, fourth, and nth time round. Repetition here seems to promise more than just more of the same: there are potential "returns" at a material level, in the form of closure. Closure in this case is also temporary,</page><page sequence="13">Nintendo and Telos 175 of course, because the player will repeat the same process with a "different" game. It is obviously very much in the the interests of Sega and Nin- tendo to provide games with terminus points, because when play- ers finish one game, master it, they will most likely want to head right out and buy another. It is also impossible to overestimate the impact of Nintendo and Sega and their "entertainment systems" on the the very paradigms and culture of video game playing. Even before Nintendo's entry into the market in the mid-1980s, arcade games were phenomenally lucrative, straddling the top of the culture industry in financial terms. In 1982 these games grossed 8 billion dollars, outstripping both pop music (4 billion) and Hollywood films (3 billion); revenue from Pac-Man alone is thought to have surpassed even Star Wars (Haddon 53). It is sober- ing to think that among the leading youth icons of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Luke Skywalker might have come second to a lit- tle yellow "icon." But 1982 marked the peak of the arcade game successes, and when Nintendo arrived on the American scene in 1985, the industry was generally thought to be in decline; in three years the bottom had fallen out of Atari's market (Kinder 88). Nev- ertheless, within five years, Nintendo had remarkably taken a firm grip on the entire industry and had effected the transition of high quality video games from arcade to living room. They achieved this coup partly by virtue of "superior technology and close control over compatible software" (Kinder 91). Equally crucial to their suc- cess was their expansion into what Marsha Kinder calls the "com- mercial supersystem of transmedia intertextuality" (92). Nintendo does not limit itself to video games, but casts its nets widely, incor- porating cartoons, magazines, clothing, games programs, and countless other product tie-ins, all copyrighted under the Nin- tendo trademark (Kinder 92-93). In other words, they deftly com- bine the twin magic of merchandising and the microchip. The big video game corporations benefit constantly from the high visibility of their names and the continual reinforcement of their consum- erist message in spheres other than simply game playing. Nintendo and Sega can never be extricated from the culture industry complex and the consumerist apparatus they inhabit. However, although it is true that the circuit of desire in video games is set up, in the crudest terms, to make money, there is by no</page><page sequence="14">176 Peter Buse means a one-to-one correlation between the financial and libidinal investments made in the games by their players, because the sig- nificance of these narratives at the cultural level exceeds any re- duction to the economy. Video games, after all, are not necessarily a money-making proposition (like all software, they can be copied and therefore require electronic protection); and it takes the mar- keting wizardry of Nintendo's commercial infrastructure to make them viable. In the remainder of this article I shall suggest how one might start to think about these video game narratives in terms of a more general economy of desire and expenditure. Kiddie Cocaine In the January 1993 "screen issue" of i-D magazine, whose cover is graced by none other than "Sonic the Hedgehog, game hero," a panel of "experts" on computer games are brought to- gether to discuss the significance and impact of the boom in com- puter games in the United Kingdom. The very first question ad- dressed to the forum includes the term "kiddie cocaine," which apparently was coined by the Sunday Times to describe the effects of games on fourteen-year-olds. The phrase has a potent emotive charge, juxtaposing the supposedly innocent with the absolutely tarnished. Members of the panel jumped at this bait and were quick to downplay the potential addictive powers of computer games. However, the topic did not so quickly go away, and one panel member proposed that the games were "compulsive," while another suggested that "[m]ost games incorporate obsessive pat- terns." Guy Nisbett summarizes most succinctly the cocaine effect: [T]he object of the game is to elevate you to an adrenalised state which is where the cocaine analogy comes in. You're en- couraged to continually project your excitement forwards and imagine you're about to get to something really interesting. Of course there's a constant denial of resolution which keeps you obsessively projecting forwards. ("i-D's Forum" 16) Already there is a hint of a Freudian formula, but it is only when the panel must answer criticism about the pervasive violence in the games that the drug equation emerges fully. Claire Bowen points out that "there are no controls ... to prevent young people being</page><page sequence="15">Nintendo and Telos 177 exposed to what could be called harmful material," and Vivienne Baker claims that "[g]ames are designed to create altered states and as powerful ones as possible" (16; my emphasis). On the reverse side of this concern, the ITV program Bad Influence, which reviews new games, consciously exploits in its title the same metaphorics of drugs. The analogies made between narcotics and computer games and addiction and obsessive playing are not particularly satisfying, at least not within the current understanding of "narcotics" and "addiction." Besides bearing the great weight of moral censure, a weight exploited by the Sunday Times in their "kiddie cocaine" phrase, drugs and addiction are also overinscribed and overana- lyzed by both the legal and medical institutions. Therefore, it is almost impossible to speak of "drugs" without invoking an entire set of values and prohibitions, both moral and legal. Nor is it pos- sible to speak of "addiction" without assuming in that use a primar- ily biological and physiological state. Nor does a simple reversal of the antidrugs stance, in the form of a sixties-style celebration of "experimentation" and addiction, escape the dominant logic about drugs. What is needed is an analysis of "drugs" that suspends the naive choice of "for" or "against" and promotes a wider explora- tion of the implications of narcotics. This is precisely what Avital Ronell attempts to do in Crack Wars: Literature Addiction Mania, pre- ferring to think about addiction in terms of desire and subjectivity rather than physiology and morality. While Ronell does not ignore the various explanatory systems brought to bear on "drugs," she points out that rarely do these systems succeed in accounting for drugs, which have a great capac- ity to "resist conceptual arrest" (51). No discipline deals with them comprehensively: Drugs cannot be placed securely within the frontiers of tradi- tional disciplines: anthropology, biology, chemistry, politics, medicine, or law could not, solely on the strength of their re- spective epistemologies, claim to contain or counteract them. While everywhere dealt with, drugs act as a radically nomadic parasite let loose from the will of language. (52) It is drugs' potential to be substituted and re-contextualized so eas- ily which allows the phrase "kiddie cocaine" to work so smoothly</page><page sequence="16">178 Peter Buse in relation to video games. Ronell's point is that the signifier, or the substance "drugs," is, beyond any explanatory analysis, libidinally invested: "To get off drugs, or alcohol (major narcissistic crisis), the addict has to shift dependency to a person, an ideal, or to the procedure itself of cure" (25). In other words, anything can act "as a drug," as an other that will provide temporary gratification. And just as an understanding of desire must go beyond the naive single object "sex," so Ronell includes in her "Narcoanalysis" "soft" drugs like caffeine and literature, as well as hard ones like cocaine, her- oin, and crack. What is at stake in "drugs"? "More so perhaps than any other 'substance,' whether real or imagined, drugs thematize the dissoci- ation of autonomy and responsibility that has marked our epoch since Kant" (Ronell 59). Crack Wars at every turn resists summary, but this statement may be plucked out of the text as a sort of thetic pronouncement. Drugs introduce the specter of dependency into the Enlightenment model of the autonomous, independent sub- ject. Dependency has a bad name: in spheres other than drug use it is equally to be avoided at all costs. In relationships, for instance, dependency is seen as a poor substitute for "love," understood as equal, reciprocal, democratic. Dependency is the realm of the ad- dict, who is controlled and driven by substances and urges outside his or her agency. With addiction, culture can establish a mode of existence that is abnormal, because dependent, and thereby reaf- firm that in general independence and autonomy are the rule. But drugs are never entirely excluded, and are subject instead to cate- gorization: "good" drugs and "bad" drugs. Metaphysics in fact em- braces drugs in small doses: "Precisely due to the promise of exteri- ority they are thought to extend, drugs have been redeemed by the conditions of transcendancy and revelation with which they are not uncommonly associated" (Ronell 61). If taken within rea- son, or so the argument goes, drugs can be a reassuring supple- ment whose "exteriority" acts as a guarantee of our interiority. Ul- timately though, drugs in their more general sense radically throw into doubt the possibility of such a thing as "nondependency." How does a "narcoanalysis" relate to the countless fourteen- year-olds "hooked" on their video games? To begin, it might be useful to remember that aside from the "kiddie cocaine" analogy, drugs and video games share a certain history. Video arcades are</page><page sequence="17">Nintendo and Telos 179 notorious as haunts of drug dealers, and many adolescents' first encounters with illegal drugs may coincide with the playing of video games. Ironically though, the appearance of games in the arcade, which was already an established setting for youth culture, was partly heralded as an opportunity to "clean up" the poor repu- tation of arcades. According to Leslie Haddon, "Amusement park owners adopted electronic games as part of a wider attempt to shed the sleazy image of the arcade . .. the electronic hi-tech form of the new games signalled a cleaner, more modern image" (59- 60). Such a position corresponds to the conception of technology as panacea and locates the games firmly within the scope of drugs, albeit "good" ones. Video games, like drugs, also promote a sort of expenditure without reserve: the player, like the addict, will divert all resources to the financing of the habit, and even be parasitic on the family- parasitic in the sense that there is no "return" on money put toward the habit. The substitution of the living room for the arcade as the dominant context for video games may have removed the immediate specter of drugs, but the boom in Nintendo and Sega has, if anything, increased the extraordinary capacity for video games to empty the pockets of their players. The rate of expendi- ture has, however, taken on a somewhat different complexion: ar- cade games take endless streams of small currency to ensure con- tinued play, while home systems require large layouts of money at staggered intervals, with the guarantee of virtually endless play. The Sunday Times hardly achieved a great journalistic insight by stigmatizing video games with the epithet "kiddie cocaine." It was more a case of reinventing the wheel, since the accusations leveled at the industry reach back to its inception: the debate is as old as the invention. In the late 1970s not only did a Labour MP in the United Kingdom attempt to pass a bill regulating Space In- vaders and other games, on the grounds they were addictive, but the surgeon general in the United States warned that the games were potentially dangerous and addictive to children (Haddon 60). The mass media and government are not alone in producing reac- tions to the video game phenomenon; video games have also come increasingly under scrutiny by the disciplines that monitor antiso- cial behavior in general. A quick survey of Sociofile yields many ex- amples of empirical research on "the effects" of video games on</page><page sequence="18">180 Peter Buse "social behavior," with titles such as "Video Games and Leisure Be- haviour: A Report on an Empirical Study," "Video Arcades, Youth, and Trouble," "Videogames, Television Violence, and Aggression in Teenagers," and "The Effects of Prosocial and Aggressive Vid- eogames on Children's Donating and Helping." The last example in this short list hints that video games might be "good" as well as "bad" drugs, if more attention is paid to their "content." In the Sociofile survey, there are also examples of video games seen as po- tentially instrumental, as "good" supplements to education: "Play as Acquisition of Mental Structures: The Case of Video Games" and "Educational and Recreational Uses of Computer Technology: Computer Instruction and Video Games." These two modes of analysis seem at odds; they read the absolutely contrary lessons of danger and utility from the games. However, they share a similar totalizing view of supplementarity as an "adding on" that can and should be controlled. Patricia Marks Greenfield, writing on child development theory, is representative of this train of thought. While rejecting the addiction thesis in favor of an optimistic evalu- ation of the games' "use" value, she repeats the classic poison/ cure dilemma: [T]oo much control over the fantasy worlds of video games could bring about impatience with the messy uncontrollable world of real life. This possible danger must, however, be weighed against the positive effects of achievement and con- trol for children who, for whatever reasons, lack a sense of competence and predictability in other domains of life (114). It is not insignificant that while relatively speaking not a great deal has been written about games from the point of view of cultural studies, there is an ever-growing literature from cognitive psychol- ogy, skills acquisition theory, sociology, and so on. The assumption prevails that video games are an inherently neutral medium and can be discussed in terms of behavior and socialization instead of culture and signifying practices. Equally telling is the bracketing of children and youth in the same category of scrutiny (and anxiety) as addiction; the potential of addiction, which lets loose depen- dent, nonautonomous subjects on the world, is to be most feared among those individuals who have not yet acceded legally, physi-</page><page sequence="19">Nintendo and Telos 181 cally, or psychically to "full" subjectivity, and who are therefore still dependent beings. Video games are a by-product of the much larger realm of computer technology, and computers are the technological pros- theses par excellence of the late twentieth century. They act as mnemonic aids, as calculating devices, as writing machines, and have countless other "uses." "User" is the apparently transparent term applied to any operator of a computer, and a "user-friendly" computer is one whose operation is so simple it is almost natural. But much more is implied by "user" than mere utility. With use comes wear and tear, repetition, erosion and loss, and of course an addict is also known as a "user." "Use" cannot be easily detached from dependency even though it immediately signifies activity and manipulation on the part of the user. The unfixing of the simple association of computers with utility goes hand in hand with a more general interrogation of the technology-progress link, usu- ally taken as self- evident. This is a good point at which to refer directly to the first part of the double title of this paper, already alluded to silently throughout the section on video game narra- tives and the death drive. In order to prise technology, and there- fore the supplement, away from its connection to the meta- narrative of progress (whose "end" is understood as telos), maybe we need to propose, tentatively, a teleology without a definite telos. Is such a thing possible? In Freud it may be, for what does Beyond the Pleasure Principle suggest if not a certain teleological oper- ation-drives, desires, instincts-in which telos has become blurred to the point of indeterminacy, even irrelevance? Perhaps the appropriate answer to Nintendo's question cum provocative challenge, "Will You Ever Reach the End?" is neither the "yes" of mastery nor the "no" of the perpetually duped subject-player, but "Who cares?" or "Does it even matter?" When Derrida announces in The Post-Card that "a letter can always-and therefore must-never arrive at its destination," this is not a source of frustration, "not something negative, it's good, and is the condition ... that something does arrive" (121). Some- thing arrives, but the arrival is not subject entirely to intention or consciousness. In the video game narrative of repetition I have just told, that which is intended never arrives, and this is a source of frustration. But where are the slippages, if any, within this seamless</page><page sequence="20">182 Peter Buse desiring (or addictive) network I have detailed? The answer, I think, is in the playing/reading process initially outlined. If a video game is a narrative that is performance-contingent, and each per- formance diverges or detours, then the traditional humanist man- ner of securing the stable meaning of a text in a proper name that stands in for the full consciousness of the intender/author no longer holds. This is the radical implication of the new narrative process that does not assume a transmission of full information from one consciousness to another. If we borrow Michel de Cer- teau's formulation of "reading as poaching" in everyday narrative practices, and substitute "playing" for reading, we can speak of a process where The reader takes neither the position of the author nor an author's position. He [sic] invents in texts something different from what they "intended." He detaches them from their (lost or accessory) origin. He combines their fragments and creates something unknown in the space organized by their capacity for allowing an indefinite plurality of meanings. (169) As de Certeau points out, such a reading activity is nothing new to literary critics well versed in the protocols of poststructuralism, but in this case the escape from passivity in reading is not limited to a privileged and enlightened group of professional intellectuals. However, the radical implications of the process are contained in video games as the narratives produce for their players a position of specularity to take up and provide for them the dangling carrot of potential presence as figured in the mastery of the game never quite attained. Take the cocaine analogy: if we are to see video games as analogous to cocaine in the spectrum of drugs, soft and hard, we might do well to remember that cocaine, which provides its user with a rush of aggressive confidence and buoyancy, has been described as a Republican drug in the United States (in con- trast to marijuana, which Bill Clinton can attest is a Democratic narcotic).

Terri Toles reflects on the militaristic implications of video games in "Video Games." 2. This anthropomorphic trend in more recent games is partly a function of improved graphics, but the desire for games with human protagonists may have other sources. Whereas in the past players more often than not manipulated spaceships or other "devices," or icons, there seems to be a tendency lately toward providing human or humanoid figures for the player to manipulate. Hence the popularity of the streetfighting genre. 3. For a social scientific take on this question, see Graybill et al. (1985) and Graybill et al. (1987). Marsha Kinder argues that the violence in video games "was not inevitable, but was partly determined by cultural coding and marketing decisions tailored specifically to the United States" (102). 4. In Playing With Power, Kinder most successfully addresses the gendering pro- cesses at work in video games without naturalizing the games as necessarily gen- der-specific. Just as I examine video narratives in terms of enunciation, Kinder focuses on the positioning of players: "In the world of Nintendo and its rival systems, players are almost inevitably positioned as active, growing, male consum- ers-whether they identify with the voracious Pac-Man, who is empowered to devour more enemies whenever he munches fruity energizers; or with the hum- ble Mario and Luigi, who are instantly transformed into giant Super Brothers whenever they consume a Super Mushroom" (85-86). See Gillian Skirrow for a darker view of games and masculinity seen through Kleinian psychoanalysis. Meanwhile, the debate about gender and technology continues, and will not abate in the near future. The volume of work on gender and video games is sizable, particularly in the social sciences. See Kaplan (1983); Trinkaus (1983); McClure and Mears (1984); Morlock, Yando, and Nigolean (1985); Braun et al. (1986); Haddon (1988); Braun and Giroux (1989). 5. Another crucial difference has to do with the respective "goals," or more aptly, "ends" of the games. In chess the aim is to capture the opponent's king and in Monopoly the victorious capitalist owns everything. There is no such definite telos in a video game, for there is no ideal conclusion to the plot; the player aims simply to extend the narrative as long as possible. I will return to this aspect of the narratives later. 6. In Britain, Sega first began using their catchphrase in June 1991; according to Nintendo's marketing office in London, the "Will You Ever Reach the End?" advertising campaign ran on British screens from October 1992 to February 1993. I am, however, unsure of the reliability of this information since I recall the catchphrase being employed both prior to and after the dates given to me by Nintendo. 7.
