Absorbed Fractions for Small Bodies: The Cube-Root-of-Mass Dependence. Radiat. Res. 57, 1-8 (1974). When the absorbed fraction for internally emitted gamma rays is calculated in the approximation, neglecting both beam attenuation and scatter buildup, the absorbed fraction is proportional to the cube root of the mass. It is generally assumed that this approximation holds only for bodies whose linear dimensions are much less than the mean free path of the primary photons. In this paper, it is shown that the validity of this approximation holds to larger sizes. In particular, absorbed fractions as large as 0.2 will be calculated with an error of less than 10% for energies sufficiently far from the minimum of M,en/,. (E &lt; 40 keV or E &gt; 0.1 MeV for a body in space, or E &lt; 30 keV or E &gt; 0.2 MeV for a body embedded in scattering media). INTRODUCTION If we make a first-order formulation2 in which we neglect attenuation and scatter buildup, the dosimetry of internal emitters is particularly simple. For a point source at r' in a volume V containing a homogeneous material characterized by an energy absorption coefficient, lien, the absorbed fraction, 0 in the notation of Loevinger and Berman (1), is /en r 1 4,- r dV.

Within the first-order formulation, the integral can always be factored into a "size" term and a "shape" term (2). An example for right circular cylinders, the absorbed fraction is (2) Aen - =--(R2L)Soc(L/R) (7) 47r Soc is the "shape geometric factor"; the size effects are contained in the cube root. These examples, which are by no means exhaustive, illustrate the relative simplicity of the "first-order" formulation of the dosimetry problem. The absorbed fraction is dimensionless. The energy absorption coefficient has the dimensions of inverse length; thus, the remaining portion of the right-hand side of all the equations has the units of length. This length must be associated with the linear dimensions of an object. Since the linear dimensions of an object increase as the cube root of the mass (assume that the density patterns remain fixed), the first-order formulations result in absorbed fractions proportional to the cube root of the mass. The question here is how valid is the first-order formulations? Or, since the effects from scatter buildup and attenuation increase with size, to what size is the first-order formulation applicable? To add attenuation but not multiple scatter, a term of the form exp(-,lAx) (M is the linear attenuation coefficient) enters into the general formulas 1 or 5; for a point source, Eq. 1 is generalized to Men r exp(-M- r - r'I) 4 = I- dV. (8) 47r Jv (r- r')2 The integrals of this and the corresponding form for the volume distribution have been solved in closed form for spheres; for a point source in a sphere, the result is 0 = e en(l - e- R)/,.( 2 (9)</page><page sequence="3">CUBE-ROOT-OF-MASS For a uniformly distributed source in a sphere (3), 4 = (4)enRF8(FR), (10) where / () + X\ F8(x) = (4/3) - ( )(e-2 - 1 + 2x - 2x2 + (4/3)x3). (11) It can be seen from Eq. 8 that, provided the distance r - r' remains much less than 1/p (the mean free path, X, for the initial photons), then we can approximate exp(-ui -r - r'l) by 1 and retain the simpler versions of the equations for the absorbed fraction. To the extent that the first-order formulation is correct, then the absorbed fraction divided by penR or ,m (M)* will be a constant not only for variable mass as is discussed in this paper but also for variable energy. This latter point has been discussed by Snyder (4). This means that a first-order calculation for an object with a certain shape, size, and photon energy can be translated to other objects of the same shape but with different sizes and/or photon energies for which the approximation is valid.3 Scatter is usually formally included by a buildup factor (cf. Ref. 5). The buildup factor is a function of the source, boundary, and target positions, except in the case of uniform infinite matter, where the buildup depends upon the source- target distance only. The buildup comes from the scattering of the photons. If the flux of primary photons is much greater than the scattered flux, the buildup can be ignored. This condition will hold if the probability of a primary photon inter- acting is small; this condition is met provided the linear dimensions of the body are much less than the mean free path. Thus, both attenuation and multiple scatter can be neglected for objects whose dimensions are much less than a mean free path. A safe definition of small, one for which the first-order formulation would certainly be valid, is a body whose dimensions are much less than a mean free path. This definition of smallness, which is arrived at by considering the attenua- tion and scatter buildup separately, is much too conservative as will be shown in the following sections. Throughout the rest of this work, the geometry of a sphere will be used to illustrate the physics of the problem. The sphere is used since it is the simplest geometry for this problem. ATTENUATION AND MULTIPLE SCATTER The absorbed fraction call be formally expanded as 4? = 41 + &lt;2 + 03 +" * * * n, (12) where 5n. is the contribution to the absorbed fraction arising from the nth collision of the photons. If this is done, Eqs. 8-10 become exact for 41. 3 The problems observed by Snyder for certain energies relate to absorbed fractions which are of the order of 1.0; plainly, the first-order approximation cannot be adequate for such configurations. 3</page><page sequence="4">HUBBARD When a photon traverses a thin piece of homogeneous matter, the probability of an interaction is proportional to the thickness. Thus, the leading term in the probability of interaction is proportional to the distance, 1, from the source to the surface. That is, the probability of a first collision in a body for which I is small enough is fl j 1. (13) The absorbed fraction for a small body is just the average probability, f1, multi- plied by the average fraction of the energy absorbed on a collision, or 41 = nenfl/#. (14) If attenuation is included, the probability is no longer simply proportional to distance. The probability is reduced because the material close to the source shields more distinct material. In fact, the probability of a first collision along a path of length I is fl = 1 - e-1 = l - (2/2)/2 + *... (15) The term ul gives rise to the first-order result. The other terms are "attenuation corrections." It can be seen that the attenuation corrections are quadratic and higher in the length. For spheres, the first collision absorbed fraction can be expressed as a power series in the radius by expanding the exponentials in Eqs. 9 or 11. For a central point source this yields 1l = AenR - IAenlR2 + ... (16) and for distributed sources, 01 = 4~.en R- iuenR+ *. (17) These equations show that the leading correction term is indeed negative and quadratic in R. Neglecting the scatter buildup will underestimate the absorbed fraction. That is, the leading scatter term, 42, will necessarily be positive. The leading term in 42 will be quadratic in the length for the following reason. The second collision probability, f2, is f2 = flfl2, (18) where f12 is the probability of a second collision occurring after a first collision has taken place either within a bounded object or in the vicinity of an embedded object. This will be proportional to the length between the point of the first collision and surface. Thus, the product, f2, will be quadratic in length. If attenua- tion is taken into account, both fi and f12 will have the form of Eq. 15. For bounded spheres, 42 can be estimated (6). Keeping only the term quadratic in R, this is 2 - 0.77(A - Pen)en*R2 (19) for a central-point source. Here the asterisk refers to the average scattered energy 4</page><page sequence="5">CUBE-ROOT-OF-MASS of the photons. For a uniformly distributed source, this is 02 0.58(- u- uen)/'en*R2. The values for 02 in Eqs. 19 and 20 are of the same order of magnitude as the leading attenuation correction term. Since u and Men vary with energy, the terms do not bear a fixed relationship to each other. Over a wide energy range, the ratio remains between 0.5 and 1.5.

The absorbed fraction 0 is calculated by the approximate method of Ref. 6. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how much better the first-order approximation is than the exact value of 1i. That is, it is much better to neglect both scatter buildup and beam attenuation than it is to take account of just one of these effects. For bodies embedded in unbounded material, 02 is greater than the values indicated by Eqs. 19 or 20. For the case of a central point source, 42 can be estimated from the tabulated results found by the moments method (5).

The error in using the first-order approximation (no scatter buildup and no attenuation) to calculate the absorbed fraction for bounded objects. For most energies, the approximation overestimates the absorbed fraction, but for energies between ca. 0.04-0.15 MeV, the approxi- mation is an underestimate. The data shown are for uniformly distributed sources; the results for central point sources are about the same. For objects surrounded by scattering media, the region of underestimate is wider-about 0.035-0.35 MeV. 6</page><page sequence="7">CUBE-ROOT-OF-MASS This results in values of 02 nearly a factor of 2 larger than Eq. 19 for energies near 20 keV; the difference between bounded and unbounded objects decreases with increasing energy until it becomes insignificant for energies at and above 1 MeV. WHAT IS SMALL The significance of the approximate cancellation of the two terms quadratic in R is that the stringent requirement for cube-root-of-mass dependence can be relaxed. The word "small" can be used to describe bodies which are larger than "much less than the mean free path X"(= 1/L). The actual maximum size will depend on the energy of the photons and the error one is willing to tolerate. In Figs. 1 and 2, it can be seen that in the vicinity of 1 mean free path, the first- order formula comes fairly close to the precise Monte-Carlo results of Brownell, Ellet, and Reddy (7). However, whether the approximation is close enough depends on the particular problem. Figure 3 shows the results of a study comparing the first-order formula to the results of the approximate method of Ref. 6. This method calculates the term 4) exactly, but estimates the scatter by approximation; it is not a useful estimate for 4 &gt; 0.25. A complete comparison with Monte-Carlo results would be desirable, but sufficient data is not available in the literature. Where the data are available, the Monte-Carlo results are about as close to the first-order values as the results of Ref. 6. In the energy region around the minimum of the ratio ,en/M, the second-order terms are most significant. In this energy region, the scatter-buildup contri- bution considerably exceeds the attenuation correction, particularly in unbounded media. Thus, there is a relatively large, positive, second-order term which causes the first-order term to seriously underestimate the absoibed fraction for all but the smallest objects. As the energy changes either up or down, the scatter contri- bution decreases relative to the attenuation correction. This gives rise to two narrow regions in which there is almost exact cancellation of the second-order terms. Beyond these regions, the attenuation correction increases relative to the scatter contribution, but both of these second-order terms become small relative to the first-order terms. The energy region in which the scatter term exceeds the attenuation extends from about 0.04 to 0.1 MeV for bounded objects as indicated in Fig. 3. For objects deeply embedded in scattering material, this region is wider (about 0.03 to 0.02 MeV). Also, in this region, the contours for 5 and 10% are much lower for the embedded object compared with the bounded object. Outside this energy region, the contours for the embedded object are higher. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that for most energies, the absorbed fractions less than ca. 0.15 can be calculated to within 5% accuracy from the first-order formu- lation. Absorbed fractions less than 0.2 are accurate to about 10% for most energies. What about other geometries? The first-order absorbed fraction will decrease as the spherical geometry is distorted, assuming constant mass. This occurs because the mean distance to the surface, 1, decreases. In fact, the first-order approximation, Eq. 2, applies to all geometries, provided R is replaced by 1. 7</page><page sequence="8">HUBBARD Equations similar to 16, 17, 19, and 20 can be developed for other geometries; they could use I and higher moments, /i. It has been shown (2) that the ratio of 4ib to the first-order term for cylinders is very close to the ratio for spheres. A similar effect for scatter buildup should exist. Snyder has shown an approximate verification in an anthropomorphic phantom corresponding to different ages containing 137Cs (4). In his example, the absorbed fraction was not exactly proportional to the cube-root of mass, but this may be due to the changes in the phantom shape with age. CONCLUSIONS The approximation neglecting both attenuation and scatter buildup is valid for many energies for considerably larger bodies than is implied by either correc- tion separately. This permits a reasonably accurate calculation with the simplest mathematics. Or, if one or two situations are known accurately, this provides a suitable functional shape for accurate interpolation or extrapolation. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author thanks A.
