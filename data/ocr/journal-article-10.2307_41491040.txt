<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Canons and Cannibalism: A Psycho-lmmunological Reading of "Diary of a Madman" Carlos Rojas It must be remembered that Lu Xun's primary ambition as a writer was to serve his country as a spiritual physician. - C. T. Hsiaf A History of Modern Chinese Fiction (1999) In the preface of Lu Xun's (1881-1936) short story "Kuangren riji" (Diary of a madman; 1918), the narrator describes his discovery of a journal written by an old acquaintance and explains that he has decided to transcribe and publish the document "in order that it might be of use to medical doctors ( y/y/a)."1 This seemingly straightforward explanation of how to read the fictional diary is complicated, however, by an underlying uncertainty about how the explanation itself should be understood. For instance, one could follow the madman's lead and treat the diary as a depiction of an infectious disease that literally transforms its victims into cannibals and that is transmitted through the act of consumption; or one might instead follow the narrator's lead and approach the work as a symptom of a delusional mental illness (which the narrator calls "paranoiac schizophrenia" [pohaikuang]) that causes the madman to believe he is surrounded by cannibals. Alternatively, one could follow the current 1 Lu Xun 1981b: 422; translation adapted from Lu Hsun 1977: 7.

For a discussion of the relationship between literal and allegorical meaning in relation to traditional "Confucian" texts, see Saussy 1993. scholarly consensus and read the story as an allegorical critique of China's "cannibalistic" illness, or what С. T. Hsia has famously called the nation's "spiritual disease" (Hsia 1999: 533). The work's "ideal" audience in the first instance would presumably be medical doctors (who would read the story for its portrayal of a mysterious infection), in the second it would be psychologists and psychiatrists (who would focus on the madman's apparent insanity), and in the third it would be the sorts of readers who, like Lu Xun himself, might serve as the nation's political reformers, which is to say "spiritual physicians]" (Hsia 1999: 46). The hermeneutic gulf separating these three readings suggests that the preface's rhetorical appeal to medicine (yP) does not provide an absolute ground for determining the text's meaning as much as it opens up a set of underlying questions of how that meaning may be understood. The trope of medicine, in other words, functions here not as a key to a "correct" reading of the story, but rather as a symptom of the inherent indeterminancies of the reading process. Published in 1918 in the reformist journal Xin qingnian (New youth; translated on the journal's masthead into French as La jeunesse), "Diary of a Madman" was the first story Zhou Shuren wrote in the modern vernacular, and the first work he published under his now-famous nom de plume, Lu Xun. One of the author's most influential and widely read pieces, "Diary" presents, among other things, a nuanced reflection on the question of how to read. In one famous passage, for instance, the madman consults an unidentified Chinese historical text in an attempt to corroborate his hazy recollection that "in ancient times, people often ate human beings." Initially, all he sees in the document is the Confucian phrase "virtue and morality" ( renyi daode) "scrawled unevenly over each page," though as he continues studying the volume deep into the night he begins to discern an injunction to "eat people" (chi ren) hidden "between the lines" (1981b: 425; 1977: 10). Although the latter "cannibalistic" reading is clearly an allegorical (mis)reading of the unidentified historical text, the Confucian reading it is contrasted with is arguably no less a product of allegoresis.2 48 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="3">The process of interpretation, the story suggests, is a matter not so much of differentiating literal from allegorical meaning, but rather of parsing the shifting discursive and institutional forces that grant significance to these different strata of signification. Here, I apply a similar between-the-lines approach to Lu Xun's "Diary," interpreting the story through the overlapping medical frames against which it is implicitly positioned. Taking inspiration from the madman's conviction that he is surrounded by an epidemic of cannibalism, together with the narrator's suggestion that the madman may have been suffering from paranoiac schizophrenia, I draw on a set of immunological and psychoanalytic models to reexamine the now-canonical interpretation of the story as a straightforward political allegory. Although many readers view the madman as a prototype of a political reformer with a privileged insight into the ills plaguing contemporary Chinese society, I suggest that the work simultaneously presents a cogent critique of the reform process itself. In particular, I argue that the story underscores the degree to which political reform is necessarily grounded on a process of recognition that entails the possibility of m/srecognition. By foregrounding this possibility of misrecognition, Lu Xun's story functions not only as a clarion call for reforming a cannibalistic social structure, but also as a sober warning about the potentially cannibalistic consequences of reform. In my reading of "Diary of a Madman," I approach Lu Xun's story through two sets of contextual materials that, I contend, offer crucial insight into the underlying logic of the text. These contextual materials include Lu Xun's autobiographical account of the circumstances that led up to his decision to compose the story, and the discursive environment of the journal, New Youth, in which the story was initially published. My approach to these two sets of material, in turn, is itself contextual, in that I view them through the conceptual lens of two bodies of medical theory that emerged precisely as Lu Xun was growing up. The final two decades of the nineteenth century not only marked the consolidation of modern germ Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 49</page><page sequence="4">3 According to Waller (2003), the "germ revolution" took place between 1879 and 1900. Similarly, the birth of psychoanalysis can be traced to the decade between 1885, when Freud travelled to Paris to study under the influential neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, and 1895, when he published, with Josef Breuer, the first of his major psychoanalytic works: Studies in Hysteria. theory, they also witnessed the origins of psychoanalysis.3 Although these two medical paradigms are very different in many respects, germ theory and psychoanalysis share a commitment to interpreting external symptoms by appealing to "invisible" factors such as microbes and the unconscious, and they both yield a vision of the individual organism/subject as internally fractured and at odds with itself. Here, I develop a psycho-immunological hermeneutics not only to help elucidate the discursive environment within which Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" was conceived and to interrogate the understanding of reform that the text is ostensibly advancing, but also to critically examine the presumption that a text may be considered a coherent and autonomous entity in the first place. Misrecognition Misrecognition represents a certain organization of affirmations and negations, to which the subject is attached. - Jacques Lacan, Freud's Papers on Technique Lu Xun's first short story collection, Nahan (Call to arms, or Outcry; 1923) - which opens with a reprint of "Diary of a Madman" - is prefaced by an autobiographical essay in which the author maps the trajectory that led him to begin writing the sort of socially critical literature he is now best known for. Lu Xun traces his decision to write "Diary" back to his early frustrations with traditional Chinese medicine, and specifically his recollection of how, as a child, he would repeatedly visit a pharmacy to fill prescriptions for esoteric remedies such as "aloe root dug up in winter, sugar-cane that had been three years exposed to frost, twin crickets, and ardisia." These treatments were for his father, but they did not keep his health from deteriorating; he passed away in 1896. Two years later, Lu Xun enrolled at the Jiangnan Naval Academy in Nanjing, where woodblock editions of translated Western physiological texts such as A New Course on the Human Body and Essays on Chemistry and Hygiene provided a 50 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="5">glimpse of Western medicine that helped convince him that traditional Chinese medical doctors such as the one who had treated his father "must be unwitting or deliberate charlatans." This realization, in turn, inspired him to study Western medicine so that he might help treat patients like his father, or even the nation as a whole (1981a: 415-416;1977: 1-2). In 1902, Lu Xun travelled to Tokyo to study Japanese, and in 1904 he enrolled in a medical school in the Japanese city of Sendai. His resolve to become a doctor was fundamentally shaken about a year and a half later, however, when, at the end of class one day, one of his professors was showing slides from the ongoing Russo-Japanese War - including an image of Japanese soldiers in Manchuria executing a Chinese man accused of spying for the Russians.4 What struck Lu Xun most powerfully about this image was neither the violence of the execution itself nor the hyper- nationalistic context of the Japanese classroom in which he happened to view it, but rather what he perceived to be the apathetic expressions of the Chinese onlookers visible in the slide. He claims that it was precisely this vision of physically healthy yet seemingly soulless spectators that helped convince him that "medical science was in fact not so important after all," and consequently inspired him to devote himself to healing not his countrymen's bodies, but their spirits (1981a: 417; 1977: 3). Many critics have followed Lu Xun's lead in using this brief account of the execution slide as an entry point into his literary oeuvre and the broader issues it engages with. The passage, though, is perhaps most interesting when it is read against the grain. David Der-wei Wang (2004: 21), for instance, points out that Lu Xun's specific appeal to an image of decapitation suggests that his desire to narrate the origins of his professional identity was driven by an underlying "anxiety about the primordial loss of meaning - meaning and life symbolized by the head, loss symbolized by the mutilated body." Lu Xun's recollection of this moment of anticipatory self-recognition, in other words, is haunted by a specter of corporeal dismemberment that not only reflects his subsequent anxiety 4 The term Lu Xun uses for slide here is dianying, which in modern Chinese is conventionally used for film or movie, but which Lu Xun is using here to refer to lantern slides or transparencies. Although many English translations and discussions of this passage refer to the images as "lantern slides" or "films," it is clear that they all must have been still transparencies. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 51</page><page sequence="6">5 Lacan (1977) presented this theory in 1936, which coincidentally was not only the publication year of both Heidegger's "The Origin of the Work of Art" and Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (which Rey Chow draws on in her own reading of this passage), but was also the year of Lu Xun's death. about "loss of meaning," but also provides the conceptual ground against which that loss itself becomes meaningful in the first place. Lydia Liu (1995: 63) develops a related point when she notes that this vignette features not merely a representation of violence, but also a reminder of a more fundamental "violence of representation" that runs through Lu Xun's work. Rey Chow (1 995: 4-8), meanwhile, draws on Martin Heidegger's and Walter Benjamin's iconic essays on visual art in the modern era to argue that Lu Xun's response to the slide can be regarded as "an index to the relationship between visuality and power" wherein Lu Xun, "through his own act of watching," is confronted with "the transparent effect of a new medium that seemingly communicates without mediation" (8). Whether focusing on textual or visual works, both of these readings underscore a dialectics of violence and elision embedded at the very heart of representation. Another way of approaching these themes of mediated recognition, corporeal fragmentation, and representational violence in Lu Xun's discussion of the execution slide isto read the scene through Jacques Lacan's mirror stage model of subject formation.5 In this model, Lacan describes a seminal moment of recognition in which an infant projectively identifies with its own (external) specular image, which thereby provides a critical catalyst for the infant's subsequent perception of itself as a unified subject. Noting that the mirror stage occurs at a developmental moment when the child still lacks any firm understanding of itself as a unified entity and remains "sunk in [its] motor incapacity and nursling dependence," Lacan argues that this process of specular "recognition" is actually a function of what he calls "m/srecognition" (méconnaissance) - wherein the infant, through a "succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body image [une image morcelée du corps] to a form of totality," models its self- conception on the idealized unity of the visual imago it sees before it (Lacan 1 977: 2, 4). The mirror stage, in other words, is predicated not on a process of straightforward identification, but rather on a strategic misidentification that then provides a catalyst for the retrospective constitution of the 52 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="7">equivalence of self and image. Even as Lacan's theory maps onto a process of maturational development the actual moment of (mis)recognition that is the mirror stage is positioned at a temporal chiasmus. It provides a conceptual ground for the infant's subsequent self-conception as a unified subject, even as it simultaneously generates an understanding of the anterior state of disunity out of which the infant's self-conception emerged. As Jane Gallop (1985: 80-81) explains, The mirror stage is a decisive moment. Not only does the self issue from it# but so does "the body in bits and pieces" [corps morcelé]. This moment is the source not only for what follows but also for what precedes. It produces the future through anticipation and the past through retroaction. And yet it is itself a moment of self- delusion, of captivation by an illusory image. Both future and past are thus rooted in an illusion. In providing a catalyst for the subject's subsequent self-conception, the mirror stage helps anchor the temporal scaffolding through which that process of self-transformation is understood. The infant's projective identification with its mirror image, in other words, generates not only the subject's subsequent vision of his or her corporeally unified self, but also the temporal continuum within which this developmental narrative is positioned. Lu Xun's description of viewing the execution slide shares with Lacan's mirror stage an emphasis on a process of self-constitution and self- conception in response to the perception of an external image, though it differs from Lacan's, of course, in that the slide functions as a site not of identification, but rather of violent c//sidentification. To theorize this logic of disidentification, we can turn to the mirror stage model as mediated through cinematic suture theory. In a seminal 1977 essay, for instance, Jean-Pierre Oudart (2003) argues that a viewer's encounter with (mainstream) cinema follows four basic stages - progressing from a mirror Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 53</page><page sequence="8">stage-like state of unmediated identification with the cinematic image, to a projective identification with an imaginary gaze embedded within the film itself. Oudart describes the viewer's initial response to cinema as a "hypothetical and purely mythical period, when the cinema alone reigned, enjoyed by the spectator in a dyadic relationship" (2003: 16), but argues that this moment of idealized identification is soon shattered by the viewer's realization of the existence of a structural frame separating the viewer from the cinematic work. The resulting structural gap, or "wound," helps drive "the image into the order of the signifier, and the cinema into the order of discourse" (17). This semiotic turn, meanwhile, makes it possible for the viewer to identify either with one of the embedded gazes within the film, or with the metaphoric gaze of the camera, and it is this gesture of projective identification, in turn, that figuratively "sutures" the rift between the viewer and the cinematic image - while inscribing the scopic wound back onto the act of perception. Viewing the execution slide in his Sendai classroom, Lu Xun finds himself unable to identify with either the image or any of the perspectivai positions available to him - including the nationalistic fervor of his Japanese classmates, the disciplinary gaze of the Japanese military carrying out the execution, or even the embedded perspective of the Chinese spectators visible within the image. The resulting perspectivai aporia forces Lu Xun to critically reexamine his own subject position, leading him to (mis)recognize his (future) identity within the scopic wound separating him from the image he sees before him - positioning himself within the perspectivai gap between observer, image, and embedded gaze. Even as Lu Xun subsequently claims to have found, in his reaction to the execution slide, an anticipatory glimpse of his future calling as an author and political reformer, the underlying dynamic of the scene is one of misrecognition and counter-identification. This suggests that the more immediate significance of this autobiographical account lies in the way it anticipates the internal struggles and alienated disavowals that so famously 54 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="9">characterize Lu Xun's subsequent literary and political endeavors. Although considerable critical attention has been devoted to the execution slide Lu Xun saw after his microbiology class, very little has been said about the immediate visual context within which Lu Xun would have perceived the slide. There is no record of what Lu Xun saw in class that day, though he does note in the Call to Arms preface that it was a microbiology course, and that the equipment used to project the slide was normally used to display "forms of microbes" (1981a: 416; 1977: 2). In another essay he wrote three years later, Lu Xun further specifies that "bacteriology [meijunxue] had just been added to the curriculum, and invariably slides were used to display the forms of the bacteria" (1981c: 306). The bacteriology course Lu Xun was taking in 1906 was not only new to the Sendai curriculum, it represented a body of medical knowledge that had only begun to take shape over the preceding two or three decades. Although some earlier scientists had theorized that microscopic organisms might cause disease, it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that researchers were able to prove it and to elaborate the practical and theoretical consequences of this insight. It was in the late 1870s and early 1880s, for instance, that Robert Koch finally succeeded in isolating the bacteria responsible for anthrax and tuberculosis, and in 1884 he and Friedrich Loeffler provided a key conceptual underpinning for understanding the significance of these bacteria when they formulated the first version of what has come to be known as Koch's postulates, which specify the basic conditions necessary for a causal relationship between a microbe and a corresponding infection. Paralleling these developments in bacteriology were a concurrent set of advances in understanding the body's response to infection. In 1880, for instance, Louis Pasteur developed a vaccine for chicken cholera; he did the same for cattle anthrax in 1881, and in 1885 he carried out the first human trial of an artificially generated vaccine - for rabies. It was also in the early 1880s, meanwhile, that the Russian-born Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 55</page><page sequence="10">6 For an intellectual biography of Metchnikoff, see Tauber and Chernyak 1991, and for an examination of the sociocultural implications of the immunological theory he helped to develop, see Martin 1995 and Cohen 2009. scientist Élie Metchnikoff began to develop the theory of immune function for which he would be awarded the Nobel Prize, and which would help explain, among other things, how vaccines provide an organism with immunity to specific diseases.6 In an autobiographical account published near the end of his life, Metchnikoff traces his discovery of the principle of immunological phagocytosis back to a day in late 1882, when it dawned on him that a category of amoeba-like "mobile cells" (which are now conventionally referred to as "wandering cells") he had been researching exhibited behavior that could also help to protect a host organism from foreign infection: One day when the whole family had gone to a circus to see some extraordinary performing apes, I remained alone with my mi- croscope, observing the life in the mobile cells of a transparent star-fish larva, when a new thought suddenly flashed across my brain. It struck me that similar cells might serve in the defense of the organism against intruders. Feeling that there was in this something of surpassing interest, I felt so excited that I began striding up and down the room and even went to the seashore in order to collect my thoughts. I said to myself that if my supposition was true, a splinter in- troduced into the body of a star-fish larva, devoid of blood vessels or a nervous system, should soon be surrounded by mobile cells as is to be observed in a man who runs a splinter into his finger. This was no sooner said than done. . . . That experiment formed the basis of the phagocyte theory, to the development of which I devoted the next twenty-five years of my life (Metchnikoff 1921: 116-117). Set against the backdrop of an uncanny spectacle of performing apes, Metchnikoffs investigation of these starfish cells inspired a set of anthropomorphic metaphors with far-reaching implications for understanding the human body. Noting that the cells appear to ingest their targets, for instance, Metchnikoff dubbed them phagocytes - from the Greek root phagein, meaning "to eat" - and it was this process of 56 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="11">cellular consumption that inspired his discovery of the ability of the immune system's white blood cells to recognize and consume harmful microbes. Just as the images Lu Xun saw in his bacteriology class presumably consisted of microbes with the potential to either infect an organism or trigger an immune response, the execution slide disturbed him to the point of triggering a figurative psychological immune response - inspiring him to shift his attention from medicine to cultural politics, in order to attack the causes of the ideological sickness that he (thought he) saw in the image. It was, in other words, his alienated response to what Roland Barthes (1982: 41) would call the image's punctum, or an anomalous aspect of a photograph that jolts the viewer out of a transparent engagement with the image, that motivated Lu Xun to figuratively consume the alien (and alienating) dimension of the execution slide, thereby transforming it into an imaginary ground for his new self-conception. This psycho-immune response, moreover, was grounded precisely on a logic of what we have called "anti-suture," in that his subsequent self-perception is derived from his inability to identify with any of the subject positions or perspectives contained within the image in question. To the extent that Lu Xun's viewing of the Japanese execution slide obeys a logic of anti-suture, whereas the bacteriological images that presumably preceded the execution slide exemplify a vision of a "body in pieces" (a body literally fractured into countless autonomous, microscopic elements), Lu Xun's preface to Call to Arms functions not so much as a conventional autobiographical narrative as what John Coetzee would call an autre- biography - a narrative of the subject as constitutively alienated, infected, and divided on itself. Like Lacan's figure of the imago , however, it is precisely this external and alienated (self-)image that provides the subject with a site of potential projective identification, a figurative mirror image against which he may identify himself.

Cited in Anderson 1985: 39. Community If the organismic metaphor is located at the center of political theory, sickness is located in the center of the metaphor. - Roberto Esposito, Immunitas: Protection and Negation of Life The themes of infection and split subjectivity that haunt Lu Xun's viewing of the 1906 execution slide also inform his decision, in 1918, to compose "Diary of a Madman." In the Call to Arms preface, he recalls that by the time his friend Qian Xuantong persuaded him to compose a story for New Youth,7 his earlier enthusiasm for political and cultural reform had faded into a deep disillusionment that he feared might "infect" (chuanran) his readers. Lu Xun ultimately acceded to Qian's request, but said he was doing so not from conviction that his works would have progressive results, but rather in accordance with what he called his "general's orders." By locating the moral impetus for his fiction outside of himself (and with the figurative "general" whom elsewhere he identifies as being "the revolutionary vanguard of the time"),8 Lu Xun was implicitly positioning himself within a double vector of contagion - attempting to quarantine his readers from his own sense of pessimism while providing a conduit through which a set of revolutionary ideals could be conveniently transmitted to those same readers. The result is a deeply fractured self-perception: the author sees himself contaminated with a potentially infectious pessimism while at the same time being asked to help transmit to his readers an optimism that he himself does not share. The metaphor of ideological contagion that Lu Xun appeals to in the account of his decision to compose "Diary of a Madman" for New Youth builds on a set of microbiological metaphors at the heart of the journal's self-conception. In 1915, for instance, New Youth's founding editor, Chen Duxiu, opened the journal's inaugural issue with a short manifesto entitled "Jinggao qingnian" (Call to youth), in which he proposed a biological 58 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="13">analogy to explain his understanding of "youth" - youth used here in the sense both of the journal's intended readership and of the journal itself.9 Chen begins the essay by comparing society's youth to the cells in the human body: Youth have the same relationship to society that fresh and vital cells have to the human body. In the metabolic process, old and rotten cells are constantly being weeded out, thereby creating openings that are promptly filled with fresh and vital cells. If this metabolic process functions correctly, the organism will remain healthy, but if the old and rotten cells are allowed to accumulate, the organism will die. If this metabolic process functions properly at a societal level, society will flourish, but if the old and rotten elements are allowed to accumulate, society will perish. (Chen Duxiu 1915; 1954: 240-243) Chen argues that in a healthy society, "fresh and vital" (xinxian huopo) elements are continually replacing "old and corrupt" ( chenfuxiubai ) ones, and he insists that China is doomed to perish because most of its own "youth" are already mentally and physically "old." He further contends that for the nation to eliminate this metaphorical "disease" ( bing ), it would be necessary for a couple of enlightened and motivated youth to "achieve self-awareness and begin to struggle" - specifying that the youth's self- awareness requires that they "be conscious of the value and responsibility of their own freshness and vitality," and that their corresponding struggle requires them to "resolutely discard the old and the rotten." The implication is that for society's youth to address the metaphorical disease plaguing the nation, they must first learn to differentiate themselves as "fresh and vital" from their "old and rotten" companions (which also implies that they must simultaneously differentiate the "fresh and vital" and "old and rotten" elements within themselves). In this way, Chen's metaphor of cellular regeneration provides a basis for understanding not only the desired social function of society's youth, but also the processes of subject formation 9 The journal was initially called Qingnian zazhi (Youth magazine), and its title was changed to Xin qingnian (New youth) in its second year. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 59</page><page sequence="14">through which those same youth come to "recognize" themselves and their designated role. Given that the purpose of this manifesto was to map out the desired function and objectives of the journal, what Chen was proposing was in effect a socioliterary mirror stage wherein the journal would function as a sort of imago of an idealized "new youth" against which readers might then projectively identify themselves. The journal, in other words, was conceived not merely as a conduit for conveying progressive ideas to its youthful readership, but also as a means of constituting the progressive readership it was apparently addressing. Chen Duxiu's "call" ( jinggao ) to youth, therefore, had a perlocutionary force, interpellating his readership into a reformist ideology through a gesture of what Althusser calls "hailing." A year later, Chen changed the title of his journal from Youth Magazine to New Youth, and marked the occasion by publishing another short manifesto in which he explains that a vast gulf exists between society's bona fide "new youth" (xin qingnian) and what he calls "old youth" (jiu qingnian). He argues that even as the mortality rates of youth in many developed nations have recently declined dramatically, China's "youth" nevertheless remain "weak and do not understand hygiene, and consequently their mortality rate from infectious disease continues to rise." The key to a nation's competitiveness, he concludes, can be found in the health and liveliness of its youth, and consequently it is precisely on account of the enfeebled state of China's youth that "everyone calls China the sick man of Asia, and indeed there are hardly any of our youth who would not fall into the category of 'sick men'" (Chen Duxiu 1916a: 1-2). Imported from Europe in the 1890s, the derogatory trope of China as the "sick man of Asia" was originally used by foreigners to critique China's perceived weakness on the world stage, but was subsequently appropriated by Chinese reformers to buttress their own progressive critiques of the nation's shortcomings. For these reformers, the "sick man" trope functions as a sort of inverse imago - an external image against which the reformers 60 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="15">were attempting to reinvent the Chinese nation. Chen, in turn, deploys this de-idealized imago to argue that the problems afflicting the nation's youth are both a cause and a symptom of the nation's figurative illness. China's "old youth," he argues, are not only vulnerable to infectious disease on account of their ignorance of basic principles of health and hygiene, their sickness is simultaneously a symbol, a symptom, and a cause of a national malady. In a short overview of the life and work of Élie Metchnikoff in the same issue of the journal, Chen Duxiu developed a related perspective on the relationship between age and infection. Chen begins by outlining the Russian scientist's model of immune response, emphasizing the consumptive metaphor underlying his understanding of phagocytosis (Chen translates Metchnikoff's neologism phagocyte into Chinese as shijunxibao, or literally "microbe-eating cells"), and then draws on a set of martial metaphors to explain the immunological function of these white blood cells: When pathogens invade the body and the threat level is increased, white blood cells will array themselves in response. As the enemy forces increase, the white blood cells continue sending additional troops fight to the death. As the battle unfolds, the body's temperature rises and the battlefield can be clearly observed if the affected tissue is examined under a microscope. Metchnikoff was the first to understand this ability of white blood cells to control and suppress pathogenic microbes. (Chen Duxiu 1916b: 3)10 This metaphor of white blood cells heroically defending the body from microbial invaders was proposed by Metchnikoff himself, and continues to appear prominently in immunological discourse even to this day. The irony of this metaphorical emphasis on the immune system's martial qualities, however, is that it implicitly shifts attention away from the organism that the immune system is ostensibly "defending" to the quasi-autonomous behavior of the immune system itself. The possibility of internecine struggle this military metaphor implies, 10 In the early issues of New Youth, each essay was paginated independently. By the fourth year of the journal (in which appeared Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" and Hu Shi's essay on Ibsen, which I also discuss here), however, the entire volume was numbered consecutively, from the first issue of the year to the last. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 61</page><page sequence="16">meanwhile, has a very real correlate in the phenomenon of autoimmunity, wherein the immune system destructively targets the body's own healthy tissue. As Chen notes, Metchnikoff emphasized that there are many circumstances under which white blood cells may turn against the body itself, thereby becoming pathogenic, and that this problem is exacerbated as an organism ages. For instance, there is a category of white blood cell, known as monocytes, which have the ability to differentiate into macrophages, or "wandering cells," and circulate through the body, targeting both foreign pathogens and the body's own diseased cells. But as the organism ages, these macrophages become increasingly likely to attack the organism's own healthy tissue, resulting in a process of internal cannibalism that is both a symptom and a cause of the aging process. Metchnikoff viewed old age as a sort of "chronic disease" caused by the body's "overly active white blood cells," and concluded that "the aging of a person's body may be attributed completely to the harm done by microbes, and is no different from the symptoms of a disease" (Chen 1916b: 5). Given Metchnikoff's interest in white blood cells' ability to "consume" both foreign pathogens and the body's own tissue, it is fitting that in the final years of his own life he became increasingly fascinated with the relationship between the aging process and digestion. Arguing that bacteria inhabiting the large intestine encourage the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, Metchnikoff contended that if only one could reduce or eliminate these gut flora, it should be possible to extend the human life span by a century or more. He proposed that one solution would be to surgically remove the entire large intestine, or alternatively, one might regularly consume fermented milk products containing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) - thereby raising the acidity of the intestine and making it a more inhospitable environment for other bacteria. The irony, however, is that the latter solution effectively inverts the conventional logic of the immune system - in that foreign bacteria come to function as a sort of second-order immune system, protecting the organism from the 62 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="17">cannibalistic tendencies of its own immune system. In Chen's summary of Metchnikoffs immunological model, we find a suggestive parallel to the vision of cellular regeneration Chen had sketched out in his earlier "new youth" manifestos. White blood cells identify and consume what Chen calls "old and rotten cells," and in the process they help the organism maintain its health and virtual youth. To the extent that these same white blood cells may attack the body's own healthy tissue, however, they thereby become equivalent to the pathogens that they were targeting in the first place - just as Chen's "youth" may become "old youth" who exacerbate society's backwardness. Chen summarizes the resulting tension between the body and its ostensible defenders with the observation that "although white blood cells may help defend ( fangwei ) the body, as the body ages they themselves become powerful enemies (di)" (Chen 1916b: 3). Although Chen Duxiu does not explicitly address the sociopolitical implications of Metchnikoff's immune system model in this essay, he does broach a related issue in his discussion of Metchnikoff's interest in the ethical ramifications of the model: he notes that Metchnikoff asked rhetorically whether the white blood cells' attacks "are necessarily carried out for the purpose of protecting the body," to which he replied that "no, the cells' consumption of microbes is not a result of their attempts to protect the body, and instead is merely a function of their need to feed themselves" (Chen 1916b: 3). Historian of science Donna Haraway raises a similar question when she asks whether the immune system represents "the ultimate sign of altruistic evolution toward wholeness," to which she similarly answered in the negative, contending that the role of the immune system is instead to actively constitute the organism as a unitary entity. She argues that the immune system functions as a virtual reading machine that produces the organism as a fundamentally hybrid entity, and which may be compared to an internal mirror stage wherein the corporeal integrity of the organism is predicated on a continual process of misrecognition at Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 63</page><page sequence="18">the cellular level (Haraway 1991: 219). In this postmodern reading of immunological theory that developed out of Metchnikoffs initial formulations, Haraway is, in a sense, merely making explicit a deconstructive logic that was implicit in theory all along. The immune system provisionally maintains the body's health and integrity through a continual process of differentiation and recognition. Immunity, in other words, is a function of a process of reading, which in turn is predicated on the necessary possibility of m/sreading. Even as Chen Duxiu's immunological model illustrates the dialectics of recognition and misrecognition underlying the very possibility of political reform, therefore, it simultaneously underscores the relationship between reading and misreading within hermeneutics itself. The audience to whom Chen Duxiu was presenting these microbiological models of political reform was not only his youthful readers, but also fellow (and future) contributors to the journal; one such contributor who appears to have taken Chen's immune system metaphor to heart is Hu Shi. A leading figure of China's New Culture movement, Hu Shi was studying in New York when Chen founded New Youth in 1915, but after returning to Beijing in 1917 he became a frequent and influential contributor. In June 1918, Hu Shi published an introductory essay to a special issue of New Youth devoted to the work of Henrik Ibsen in which he presents an overview of Ibsen's works and concludes with a detailed discussion of the play Enemy of the People. As Hu Shi explains, the protagonist of the work, Dr. Stockman, discovers that his town's local hot springs may be used to create health-restoring baths, and when the locals hear his proposal they decide it is feasible, and therefore proceed to raise funds to build several such baths. The fame of these baths spreads throughout the region, leading patients to come in from all over to treat their illnesses. As more and more visitors arrive, the local economy booms and Dr. Stock- man establishes a hot bath medical clinic. Eventually, however, 64 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="19">some of the patients begin falling ill, and Stockman suspects that they have contracted infections from the health-restoring baths themselves. He sends a water sample to a university laboratory for analysis, which reveals that the baths' pipes were not sealed tightly enough, thereby permitting the introduction of foreign contaminants. (Hu Shi 1918: 499) The irony that these "hygienic baths" become breeding pools of infectious microbes is implicitly underscored, in Hu Shi's Chinese-language summary, by the homophonic resonances between the baths' intended function in promoting public hygiene (weisheng, or literally "the defense of life"), and their actual role in transmitting harmful microbes ( weishengwu , or literally "microscopic life"). Embedded within the concept of socio/corporeal "defense," in other words, is the possibility that the defensive agents may become threats in their own right. Even more dangerous than the infectious baths, meanwhile, is the community's defiant resistance to Stockman's attempts to address the crisis. In Hu Shi's words: Upon receiving this evidence of the baths' contamination, Dr. Stockman releases a comprehensive announcement and asks the board of directors to address the health crisis by replacing all of the pipes to the baths. He doesn't anticipate, however, how expensive and time-consuming this process will be. Given the harm that a two-year closing of the baths would pose to the local economy, the townspeople are unanimous in their adamant opposition to Stockman's recommendations, suggesting that they would prefer to have patients die of infection rather than endure the financial setback that the closure of the baths would entail. The community uses an authoritarian power to suppress the views of this truth- telling doctor and prevent him from speaking. When Stockman writes a report, the local press refuses to publish it; and when he tries to publish it himself, the printer declines to accept it. When Stockman tries to convene a meeting to communicate his views, he finds that no one is willing to lend him a room; and after he does Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 65</page><page sequence="20">11 Hu Shi's immunological reading is, of course, anachronistic, given that the play was published in 1882, the same year Metchnikoff began to develop his theory of phagocytosis. finally manage to find a venue, his audience chases him off the stage, unanimously declaring him to be an enemy of the people. (Hu Shi 1918: 499-500) Even as Stockman is attempting to address the health crisis he helped create, the community identifies Stockman himself as the greatest threat to their collective interests, thereby transforming the self-appointed "defender" of the community's well-being into its own worst enemy. Although Ibsen's play clearly sympathizes with Stockman, the title of the work nevertheless reminds us that the community views the doctor as a dangerously destabilizing element - a true "enemy of the people." At one point in the play, Stockman notes that the town's public baths are described in organismic terms as "the 'main artery of the town's life- blood,' the 'nerve-centre of the town,' and the devil knows what else" (Ibsen 2008: 24). In his New Youth essay, meanwhile, Hu Shi proposes a different set of metaphors to describe the work's underlying logic: It is as if [Ibsen] were saying, "People's bodies all rely on the innu- merable white blood cells in their bloodstream to be perpetually battling the harmful microbes that enter the body, and to make certain that they are all completely eliminated. Only then can the body be healthy and the spirit complete." The health of the society and of the nation depend completely on these white blood cells, which are never satisfied, never content, and at every moment are battling the evil and the filthy elements in society. Only then can there be hope for social improvement and advancement. (Hu Shi 1918: 506) In this immunological reading of Ibsen's play, Hu Shi compares Stockman's efforts to renovate the infected baths to white blood cells' response to foreign pathogens, but then immediately translates this medical model into a broader sociopolitical metaphor for reformers' efforts to eradicate the "evil and filthy elements in society."11 To the extent that Metchnikoff's original model of immune response suggests that white blood cells, in 66 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="21">addition to protecting the body from infection, also have the capacity to devour it from within, Hu Shi's own immunological metaphor for sociopolitical reform inadvertently brings out the moral ambiguity at the heart of Ibsen's play - namely, that Stockman and the townspeople have radically different perspectives on the question of who is actually "defending" society and who is its true "enemy." Hu Shi's immunological metaphor is grounded on a couple of key paradoxes. His description of the body's "innumerable white blood cells" would appear to correspond better to the townspeople's collective response to Stockman's actions, as opposed to the solitary crusade of Stockman himself (whose own motto, as Hu Shi notes, is that "the strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone"). More generally, Hu Shi's metaphor assumes that white blood cells will necessarily support the interests of the organism, whereas the crux of Ibsen's play lies precisely in the fact that Stockman and the other townspeople disagree fundamentally over what the community's true interests are. On the one hand, Stockman sees himself as addressing a public health crisis, though from the townspeople's perspective his attempts to reform the town's baths constitute the most immediate threat to the community's (economic) well-being. On the other hand, the townspeople regard Stockman as an "enemy of the people," though the play suggests that the town's misdirected immunological response to Stockman's actions constitutes the greatest threat to the community as a whole. The ultimate "enemy of the people," under this latter reading, is in fact the community itself. Even as Hu Shi's immunological interpretation of Enemy suggests that society may misrecognize a threat to its collective interests, his analysis illustrates the possibility that immunological elements may misrecognize their ostensible targets, together with the principle that the very act of reading itself is predicated on the necessary possibility of misreading. In particular, the immunological model Hu Shi deploys to explain the play's reformist logic inadvertently illustrates the precise opposite - the Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 67</page><page sequence="22">possibility that a community might collectively target and "consume" the very reformist elements that are attempting to help heal it. The latter interpretation assumes either that the townspeople are misrecognizing their true interests, or that the town is in fact correct in targeting Stockman as a destabilizing threat, and that our sympathy for Stockman's righteous and solitary crusade is somehow misplaced. Of Cannibalism and Canons If we want China to improve, it would perhaps be best if everyone were illiterate; because once people are able to read, it is as though they are thereby contaminated by this disease of canonicity - Lu Xun, "A Reading Canon for the Fourteenth Year [of the Republic]" Published in New Youth in May of 1918, Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" develops many of the same issues that Hu Shi would foreground in his discussion of Enemy of the People in the following issue of the journal. In particular, "Diary" and Enemy both revolve around a solitary individual who becomes aware of a pernicious threat to his community, and consequently becomes ostracized by that same community. Although Lu Xun was not directly influenced by Hu Shi's Ibsen essay (which, after all, was published after his story), both works were informed by the same discursive environment, which included Chen Duxiu's microbiological explication of the desired function of the journal New Youth itself. I suggest that the psychoanalytic and immunological vision of fractured subjectivity implicit in Chen Duxiu's microbiological essays finds its logical conclusion in both Hu Shi's Ibsen essay (which explicitly cites Metchnikoff's model of phagocytotic white blood cells to describe a community that has turned in on itself) and Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" (whose thematization of an epidemic of cannibalism concretizes not only the specter of infection underlying the immunological metaphor, but also the possibility of autoimmune collapse 68 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="23">wherein the phagocytotic white blood cells turn back on the body [politic] itself). This sort of psycho-immunological reading of Lu Xun's story, however, complicates the conventional understanding of the work's status as an allegory of political reform. If the town's epidemic of cannibalism is compared to the specter of a "cannibalistic" autoimmune crisis, for instance, then the story becomes not so much an allegory of a reformist critique of regressive institutions and ideologies, but rather a commentary on the structural limits of political reform. To the extent that reform is understood in quasi-immunological terms as a process of recognition and consumption, in other words, then it contains within itself the necessary possibility of m/srecognition resulting in an autoimmune attack on "healthy" elements of the body (politic). The story's cannibalism, therefore, can be understood as not merely the object of reform, but also, and more importantly, the mirror image of reform itself. Distinguishing between progressive "immunological" reform and cannibalistic "autoimmune" self-destruction, moreover, is literally a question of hermeneutics, a blurred line between recognition and misrecognition, reading and misreading. Seen in these terms, the story implicitly raises the possibility that the madman may, in fact, be misinterpreting the significance of the "cannibalism" he perceives around himself - raising the possibility that, in fact, it is he who poses a threat to the status quo, and that society's efforts to contain him are bona fide immunological responses to what Chen Duxiu might call an "old and corrupt" element that threatens the health of the body politic. This hermeneutic tension in the story is reinforced by the work's two endings. On the one hand, the text proper famously concludes with the madman's speculation that "perhaps there are still children who have not yet eaten men," followed by his plea to "save the children" (1981b: 432). Convinced that his own infection by the cannibalistic virus is a foregone conclusion, the diarist nevertheless holds out hope that it might still be possible to save some of the children who have not yet been "infected," Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 69</page><page sequence="24">which is to say fully interpellated into society's cannibalistic ideology. This optimistic note at the end of the story, however, appears out of line with the work's generally dark sensibility, and consequently can be seen as an example of the sort of "bent pen" ( qubi ) innuendoes that Lu Xun, in his preface to Call to Arms, reports that he would often add to his stories to conform to the optimistic expectations of his "general's orders" (Lu Xun 1981a: 419; 1977: 5). In particular, his appeal to children's redemptive potential could be seen as an allusion to Chen Duxiu's conviction that the possibility of societal transformation lay in society's "new youth." On the other hand, a rather different conclusion can be found in the work's preface: composed in classical Chinese and chronologically set after the events detailed in the actual diary, this preface observes that the "madman" has already recovered and "gone elsewhere to take up an official post." Given that the story implies that China's pernicious cannibalistic culture is rooted in its Confucian ideology and bureaucratic structure, this remark that the diarist is waiting for a position within the official bureaucracy implies that he has, in effect, been reabsorbed by the very same cannibalistic institutions he was trying to draw attention to in the first place. From the community's perspective, therefore, the destabilizing threat that the madman had previously represented has been neutralized, as he recovers his "sanity" and is successfully reinterpellated into society. Even as this psycho-immunological reading of "Diary" complicates the canonical reading of the story as a straightforward reformist text, it simultaneously comments on how texts (and interpretations) become canonical. The process by which social elements are collectively recognized as either beneficial or harmful, in other words, mirrors that by which texts are read and understood. The possibility that Lu Xun's madman may have misinterpreted the significance of the (cannibalistic) behavior of his family and neighbors precisely mirrors the possibility that readers may have systematically misinterpreted the significance of the story's own representation of cannibalism. Seen in these terms, the story's presentation 70 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="25">of cannibalism as a metaphor for a hegemonizing force not only has sociopolitical implications (symbolizing a process by which societal elements that are perceived to be "foreign" are systematically reincorporated by either an existing or a new societal mainstream), but also hermeneutic ones (symbolizing a process by which textual readings perceived to be "foreign" are systematically reincorporated by either an existing or new canonical body of interpretation). Lu Xun himself presents an interesting commentary on these canon- making processes in a 1925 essay entitled "Shisi nian dedujing" (A reading canon for the fourteenth year [of the Republic]). The essay opens with a critique of a recent call for the development of a "reading canon" for contemporary China, claiming that the classical texts to be included in such a canon would be so ideologically tainted that "if we want China to improve, it would perhaps be best if everyone were illiterate; because once people are able to read, it is as though they are thereby contaminated by this disease of canonicity [dujing de binggen]" (Lu Xun 1981 d). Just as Lu Xun's madman believes the culture of cannibalism to be so pervasive that it is almost impossible to avoid being contaminated by it, Lu Xun himself suggests half-satirically here that the traditional ideologies that underlie China's canonical texts are so pernicious that the mere condition of being literate virtually guarantees that one will become infected by them. Lu Xun returns to another version of this metaphorical "disease of canonicity" at the end of the essay, where he compares the destructive effects of traditional canons to the accumulation of waste elements in the body. He explains that the presence of these waste elements causes white blood cell monocytes to differentiate into macrophages, which may then begin "devouring [the body's own] tissue ( canshi ge zuzhi)." From this biomedical model, Lu Xun then proposes a broader immunological metaphor for society: An old and feeble country probably cannot avoid this kind of phenomenon [of the pernicious effects of the canonical texts]. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture • 71</page><page sequence="26">12 Lu Xun provides this alternative transliteration of Metchnikoff's surname. This situation is like that of an aging human body, in which waste material increases and mineral sediments accumulate in the tissue, rendering it rigid and susceptible to failure. The immune system's "wandering cells" are gradually transformed and begin focusing only on themselves; and if there is the slightest opening, these cells will immediately rush in and devour the [body's own] tissue - laying the tissue to waste and making it susceptible to annihilation. The famous Russian doctor Elias Metschnikov12 gave these cells a new name: "Fresserzelle," or macrophages (dajuexibao) [literally, "big chewing cells"]. (1981 of: 130) After identifying the potential threat of these metaphorical macrophages, Lu Xun suggests that the simplest remedy would be to eliminate them: "It is said that it is necessary to first eliminate these cells in order for the body to avoid aging, and in order to do so it is necessary to take a daily dose of acid. [Metchnikoff] himself practiced this" (1981 of: 130). Here Lu Xun turns Metchnikoff's suggestion that foreign bacteria may be used as a second-order immune system to protect the body from the cannibalistic tendencies of its own immunological white blood cells on itself - introducing Metchnikoff's proposal as a distinctly alien element that may offer a cure for the infectious and cannibalistic tendencies that characterize China's own literary and ideological canon. At the same time, the foreign, even alien, connotations that Metchnikoff's biomedical proposal carries in Lu Xun's 1925 essay suggests an answer to our initial question of how to interpret the trope of "medicine," or yp, in "Diary of a Madman." The answer, Lu Xun suggests in his allusion to Metchnikoff at the end of the "reading canon" essay, is that the trope of "medicine" (yp) in the work functions precisely as a figure of alterity iyi2), a foreign element that demands a critical reappraisal of that which is perceived to be familiar. 72 • Of Canons and Cannibalism</page><page sequence="27">Glossary bing £ chenfu xiubai ШШ5ЙЙ chi ren DËÀ chuanran fllsfë dajuexibao ЛИШАЙ d¡ Ш dianying Igfg dujing de binggen ШШ№ШШ fangwei |ййт jiu qingnian В*№ meijunxue HBP pohaikuang ÎÊSîi Qian Xuantong qubi ЙШ renyi daode ttSîiiS canshi ge zuzhi ÜÄSliflM weisheng weishengwu ffllkWH xin qingnian xinxian huopo ïfîiÊâÎS yi1 S y¡2 m yijia mm Bibliography Anderson, Marston. 1985.
