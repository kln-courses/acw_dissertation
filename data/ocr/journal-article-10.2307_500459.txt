<plain_text><page sequence="1">The End of the Early Bronze Age in Anatolia and the Aegean JAMES MELLAART PLATES 1-3 INTRODUCTION The purpose of this paper is to review the archae- ological evidence for the period during which Hittites and Greeks are generally supposed to have entered their historical homes. In the last ten years, much new evidence has been forthcoming, partly in excavations, partly the result of a systematic survey of pre-classical sites in Ana- tolia, undertaken by members of the British Insti- tute of Archaeology at Ankara. This has enabled us to construct a relative chronology of Anatolia, to which absolute dates can be assigned through a new synchronism with Mesopotamia, found at Kiiltepe near Kayseri. The chronological back- ground is treated in detail by the writer in an article, entitled "Anatolian chronology in the Early and Middle Bronze Age," appearing in Anatolian Studies 7 (0957), to which the reader is referred. For reasons explained there, the writer adheres to the so-called high chronology, that advocated by A. Goetze, B. Landsberger and K. Balkan, which places Hammurabi of Babylon c.1850 B.c. The tentative nature of many of the conclusions reached here hardly needs emphasizing, but they seem to be consistent with the archaeological evi- dence now available. At the end of the Early Bronze Age, c.1900 B.c.,' a fair number of important sites in Central Anatolia were destroyed by fire and more were deserted. The same phenomenon may be observed in Eastern and Northwestern Anatolia and there can be no doubt that some kind of upheaval took place throughout the country. Across the Aegean, the contemporary Early Helladic settlements on the Greek mainland ended in a conflagration of catastrophic nature, whereas the Cyclades, Crete and most of Southern Anatolia appear to have escaped destruction. It is very likely that the events in Anatolia and the Aegean are interrelated and the geographical distri- bution of destroyed or deserted Early Bronze Age sites provides suggestive evidence for the direction from which these disturbances came. THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF EARLY BRONZE AGE SITES, DESTROYED OR DESERTED AROUND 1900 B.C. (pl. I, map i) Placed on a map, destroyed or deserted Early Bronze Age sites form an interesting geographical pattern, clustering thickest on either side of the natural route leading from the Caucasus to the Northern Aegean. Although Northeastern Anatolia, Colchis and Georgia are still very imperfectly known archaeo- logically, there is already ample evidence for a break between the local Early and Middle Bronze Age cultures. As these cultures are all closely re- lated, being members of one great East Anatolian family,2 at least during the Early Bronze Age, the date for the end of that culture can be fairly ap- proximately fixed within the twentieth century B.c. on the evidence of the latest pottery from Karaz Hiiyiik3 near Erzerum, which resembles that of Kiiltepe II (c.2000-1900 B.C.).4 Middle Bronze Age pottery is significantly lacking at every Early Bronze Age site excavated, e.g. at Nidhznem Gomi in Col- chis,5 Beshtashen6 and Osni' in the Trialeti district of Western Georgia and, among the many sites in 1 1900 B.C. is the approximate date for the end of the Middle Bronze Age in most of Anatolia and the Aegean, but in Cilicia the Middle Bronze Age begins c.2zoo, in Crete MM I begins between 2I00 and 2000 and Kiiltepe II, beginning c.2ooo, might perhaps already be considered as Middle, rather than late Early Bronze Age. 2 The distribution of these East Anatolian Early Bronze Age cultures has become much better known as the result of an extensive field-survey, undertaken by C. A. Burney in Eastern Anatolia during the summer of 1956, in which he covered most of the country between Sivas and the Persian frontier. a For Karaz see the report on a sounding; Dr. Hamit Z.

Further westward along the road from Erzerum to Sivas, Pulur Hiiyiik`o near Baiburt, Kiiltepe near Hafik" and Maltepel2 near Sivas, all show destruc- tion layers attributable to the end of the Early Bronze Age. In Central Anatolia, the prosperous Assyrian karum or trading settlement below the walls of the great city of Kanesh (now Kiiltepe near Kayseri) was reduced to ashes c.900oo B.c. (level ii)1' and not reoccupied for half a century. The contempo- rary city of Alishar Hiiyiik, another trading centre, suffered the same fate (level i i Tb)," but the destruction of Alaca Hiiyiik V is definitely earlier."5 Among the many sites in the Kirsehir basin, Has Hilyjik, the only one excavated, was burnt,'" and south of the river Halys, the destruction layers of the great mound of Acemk6y near Aksaray indi- cate a conflagration about 1900oo B.c. or a little later.I7 In the hill country between the Halys and the Sangarius, widespread destruction occurs; Karao'- lan,'8 Bitik,'9 Polatli20 and Gordion are burnt, and Etiyokusu, Cerkes and several other sites21 are de- serted. Within the great bend of the Sangarius, the plain of Eskisehir was studded with Early Bronze Age villages of the Demirci Hiiyiik culture, and at least half the number were deserted after 1900oo B.C. and not reoccupied.22 Further westward still, the two large mounds of K6priioren and Tavsanli, west of Kiitahya, are littered with burnt bricks of the destroyed city walls, in either case associated with pottery of the end of the E.B.A. (Troy V type) and the neighbouring site of Tepecik appears to have been deserted after the end of this period.23 Between this region and the Troad lies the Bali- kesir plain, now famous as the centre of the Yortan culture, the knowledge of which is almost entirely drawn from its cemeteries. None of these contained any pottery later than the end of the E.B.A.24 In the Troad, Troy V was not destroyed by fire, but the next period shows a change of culture"2 and two other sites, Kumtepe II and Karaagagtepe, the so-called mound of Protesilaos on the Thracian Chersonese are deserted.26 On Lemnos, the last E.B.A. settlement of Poliochni is said to have been destroyed by earthquake, but the site is not reoc- cupied in the Middle Bronze Age.27 We have now rather laboriously traced a long line of burnt or deserted sites, which demonstrate some disturbance in the northern half of Anatolia at the end of the Early Bronze Age. In each case there is reason to think that its sudden end came somewhere about 1900 B.c. and even if future re- search eliminates some of the sites from our list, it will undoubtedly add others.

Its publication will have to wait until the excavations at the latter site are finished. 24 The latest pottery in the Yortan cemeteries is of Troy V type and a study of metal types from the robbed cemetery of Bayinderk6y near Balikesir leads to the same result.

Bulgarian scholars date the end of their Early Bronze Age (Yunacite, Salcutza, Esero, etc.) to c.900oo,8 and the sudden desertion of those sites added to the complete ab- sence of a Middle Bronze Age certainly indicates some catastrophe. In Macedonia, on the other hand, the transition from an Early Bronze Age, Northwest Anatolian in character, to a more local and Northern Middle Bronze Age, with incised spirals and maeanders, seems to have taken place peacefully.29 In Thessaly also, the latest excavations at Gremnos near Larisa show a peaceful development of a local E.B. into a local M.B., apparently unaffected by the momen- tous changes taking place further south."3 Mainland Greece from Boeotia to the Pelopon- nese, on the other hand, was hit by a catastrophe of such magnitude that it invites comparison with a similar one, the so-called Dorian invasion, which destroyed Mycenaean civilization at the end of the Bronze Age. Destruction layers of the end of the Early Helladic III period c.I9oo B.c. have been found at Orchomenos, Eutresis, Hagios Kosmas, Raphina, Apesokari, Korakou, Zygouries, Tiryns, Asine, Malthi and Asea. Many other sites are de- serted, e.g. Yiriza, Synoro, Ayios Gerasimos, Kop- hovouni, Makrovouni, Palaiopyrgos, etc." Others still show gaps in the occupation, rebuilding on a reduced scale or a shift in position of the new Mid- dle Helladic settlement.32 So far, Lerna is the only site excavated, where the transition from Early to Middle Bronze Age appears to have taken place without any interruption.33 This thorough devastation of Central Greece and the Peloponnese was followed by the arrival of a new culture, which, it is generally agreed, had no connection whatsoever with its predecessor. Moreover, these approximately contemporary disturbances in Northern Anatolia, Bulgaria and Greece are unlikely to be a coincidence and unre- lated, and they can hardly be interpreted as the result of local wars or earthquakes,34 the more so as adjacent regions appear to have escaped destruction. Only one satisfactory explanation can be offered in these circumstances and that is one of migration, a conclusion which finds support in the fact that in Anatolia the disturbances follow the line of the main natural road from the Caucasus to the north- ern Aegean. Theoretically, of course, this migration or rather series of migrations could have come either from the east or from the west. However, archaeological probability excludes a movement starting from the west coast of Greece, which after overrunning the great centres of Early Helladic culture on the east coast, crossed the Aegean, in- vaded Northern Anatolia and Bulgaria without touching Thessaly and Macedonia and finally ended up in the shadow of the Caucasus mountains. Fortu- nately we are not reduced to guessing, for a series of what may be called "refugee cultures" are found in Anatolia, which in each case fled from invaders coming from the East (infra, "Cultural Background ..." and "Effect of Hittite Invasion ..."). AREAS UNAFFECTED BY THE MIGRATIONS The invasion which brought to an end the flour- ishing Early Helladic civilization of Central and Southern Greece did not touch either Thessaly and Macedonia, except for one or two sites in the Chal- cidice,35 or the Cyclades and Crete.3 Consequently there is no real break in the various cultures of those regions. In Anatolia, the position is the same: south of the belt of disturbance the development from Early to Middle Bronze Age is uninterrupted at Thermi," Larisa,"3 Bayrakli,39 Beycesultan,40 none of which shows the slightest trace of any disturbance c.1900oo B.c. To these sites we may probably add Kusura,4" Sizma42 and Kara Hiiyiik (Konya)."'

Nor have we found any regions with num- bers of E.B.A. sites, deserted c.1900 B.C., during our extensive surveys in Southern Anatolia, such as are common e.g. in the Eskigehir plain. One may add that there are also no traces of dis- turbance at this date in Cyprus, North Syria, North Mesopotamia, the Araxes valley and the Urmia region.45 It appears therefore that, though extensive areas of both Anatolia and the Aegean were affected by the migrations at the end of the Early Bronze Age, the wave of devastation was far from universal. How this affects the traditional picture of the simultaneous arrival of the three Indo-European speaking peoples, Hittites, Luwians and Palaites, in Anatolia, will be discussed in detail below. Before attempting to identify the invaders, the cultural background of Anatolia on the eve of the invasion must be briefly sketched. THE CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF ANATOLIA IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE MIGRATIONS In the twentieth century B.C. a series of different cultures is found in Anatolia, which for convenience we may divide into a western and an eastern group. To the eastern group belong the Karaz culture, now in its third and last phase and the related so- called E.B.A. of Trialeti,46 known only from a group of barrows between Tiflis and the Turkish frontier. Finely incised black wares are the charac- teristic product of these cultures, which appear to have borne the brunt of the invasion, and which, as far as we know, disappeared along the invaders' route. Further east, in the Araxes valley around the lakes of Urmia and Van, contemporary painted pottery cultures flourished,47 but these were appar- ently untouched and continued well into the second millennium B.C. Further west, but again south of the invaders' route, lies a newly discovered painted pottery culture in the region of Elazig, Malatya and Divriki.4 On the other hand, Maltepe near Sivas, the centre of an extremely localized painted ware,49 was destroyed by the invaders, as it lay on the line of their march westward. Kiiltepe near Kayseri, which suffered the same fate, was, on the eve of its destruction, probably the richest city in Anatolia, and centre of the important Cappadocian trade with Assyria, and it had developed a culture which should be regarded as the ancestor of the so-called Hittite culture of second millennium Central Ana- tolia.50 This culture, usually referred to as "Kiiltepe II," seems to have been confined to a rather limited area between Kayseri, Aksaray and Alishar." Further west, the painted ware ("Cappadocian or Alishar III"), already rare at Kiiltepe, may still have been in use in the Kirsehir basin. It is this culture, or rather a poor variant of it, which, intro- duced into the Ankara-region after the end of the Early Bronze Age (Polatli III)," provides a pointer to the direction from which the thrust into Central Anatolia came. Other E.B.A. cultures existed north of the Yozgat-Kirsehir area, but since they are irrelevant to the main argument, we may be excused for omitting them here. Crossing the western bend of the river Halys, one enters a territory where eastern and western influences met."3 At the period under discussion, West Anatolian influences were predominant, and Polatli, situated at its western end, was completely western."4 As a result of the invasion, refugees from further east conquered the area," perhaps after fierce resistance, if we may judge by the amount of destruction in this region. The western group of cultures was remarkably 4 H. Goldman, Tarsus II, 62 and see my article in AnatStud 7 (I957). 45 There appears to be no break between the Geoy Tepe D and C pottery phases. T.

To use this evidence for dating the Troy V period before the Cappadocian ware would be a fallacy. 65 There is eastern Alishar chalcolithic in the region (Ka- raoilan) followed by a western ribbed and fluted ware in the E.B.A. The second millennium pottery is again eastern in derivation, but the Phrygian grey ware is western. 54i.e. Polatli II, AnatStud I (1950) 46. 55 Cappadocian ware was also found at Karaoilan, Belleten 3 (i939) pl.

It extended all over Western Anatolia and until 2100 B.c. it included Cilicia. Even during the first phase of the Cilician Middle Bronze Age, roughly the twenty-first cen- tury, western elements were still by no means ex- tinct,"6 though the new painted pottery introduced by newcomers from the east was rapidly gaining popularity. In spite of its homogeneity, local varia- tions persisted and the old area of the Demirci Hiiyiik culture, the country in and around the great bend of the river Sangarius, preserved a somewhat tenacious conservatism.57 Differences be- tween the Troad and the Iznik and Kiitahya region were also marked, and their importance will be discussed later on in this paper. One significant point must however be men- tioned; the fundamental difference of population inferred by K. Bittel from the archaeological record between the West Anatolian-Aegean group and the Eastern cultures." These two groups differ con- siderably from each other, not only in pottery, house-plans etc., but more important still, in burial customs. Intramural burial is the rule in the eastern group, extramural burial in cemeteries of the west."9 Even the change of culture in Cilicia c.2Ioo B.c. does not appear to have changed this custom. CULTURE AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE INVADERS Nowhere in Eastern or Central Anatolia, which is archaeologically much better known, has any material evidence been found which might throw light on the culture of the invaders. So far not a single weapon, pot, or other object can be ascribed to them and though it is usually assumed that they introduced the horse and chariot, horses on reliefs and horse heads on Kiiltepe II pottery antedate the migration, though perhaps not by very long."60 On the other hand, no bones of horses have yet been recorded from this or the immediately suc- ceeding periods in Central Anatolia. So far, we only know of them in Troy,"1 where they occur from the very beginning of the sixth citadel, i.e. from 1900 B.C. onwards. Without more evidence this question cannot be decided, but the presence of the horse at Kiiltepe and Troy does suggest that horse and presumably chariot were already in use c.I900.62 The complete absence of any material culture attributable to the newcomers inevitably suggests that they were culturally far inferior to the people among whom they settled, and whose civilization they adopted. But for the destruction and disturb- ance caused by their migration, they might have left no mark on the archaeological record." As few sites have been excavated in Central Anatolia, the amount of destruction is difficult to estimate, but the absence of a great and lasting cultural break in Central Anatolia at this time does not suggest that the migration had as disastrous an effect on the old population as that of the Middle Helladic invaders in Greece. For fifty years the site of the destroyed karum of Kanesh was uninhabited and used occasionally as a cemetery by the mer- chants, who had taken refuge within the walls of the city."6 This rather suggests that the city of Kanesh itself escaped destruction c.x9oo and in the remains of a palace of this period, intermediate between karum II and Ib, which we have called Ic, tablets of a king of Kanesh, Warsama, son of Inar, were found."5 One of these is a letter sent to the king of Kanesh by Anum-hurpi, king of Mama, and 56 The transitional nature of the first phase of the M.B.A. in Cilicia is emphasized by H. Goldman, Tarsus II, pp. 62, 348. 57 As is evident from a glance at the plates in K. Bittel and H. Otto, Demirci Hiiyiik.

Horse bones are reported from Mikhalits and other sites of the Veselinovo culture, see AnatStud 6 (1956) 45-46. 62 There is no reason why the chariot should not have been invented in northern Mesopotamia or Anatolia. The adaptation of the oxcart to the horse is not necessarily a European invention. Not a single second millennium chariot has been found in Europe. It is interesting that as late as the developed M.B.A. in Trialeti, which B.A. Kuftin dates to c.I75o-I5oo .c., horses are conspicuously absent among the many animal bones found there. Barrow XXIX contained, on the other hand, a solid- wheeled oxcart with the remains of the oxen that drew it.

The material culture of Kanesh Ib is as rich as that of Kanesh II; trade was resumed with Assyria and riches flowed into the country. The Kanesh Ib culture is obviously a development from that of Kanesh II, and the hundred years which separate the two main assemblages, both found in burnt levels and therefore belonging to the period immediately preceding the destruction, seems ample to account for the change. It is this Kanesh Ib culture which spread all over Central Anatolia and which has been found from Bog- hazkoiy, Alishar, and Alaca in the west to Kara Hiiyiik-Elbistan in the east, as the fully developed Central Anatolian Middle Bronze Age culture. Its development does not suggest that a numerous body of semi-barbaric immigrants had settled in the Kay- seri region or occupied Central Anatolia. More likely, they had settled or had been settled in the fertile regions further west, around Kirsehir in the southern Halys basin,'7 where they had ousted the local population which, as we have seen, moved westward from their homes and invaded the region between Halys and Sangarius. The so-called Anita text,"s a Hittite copy of an earlier document, refers to the war which Anita's father Pithana, king of Kussara, waged against the city of Nesa. The city was conquered, its people spared and its gods honoured through the building of new temples. Nesa became one of the residences of the kings of Kussara. This text is exceptionally important, for Pithana and Anita are historical kings, who lived in the Kanesh Ib period (c.1850- 1800 B.C.)69 Moreover, the Hittites spoke an Indo- European language which they themselves called Nasili or Nesili, the language of the city of Nesa. This can only mean that the Hittites had, upon their arrival in Central Anatolia, settled in or around that city, from which they, or more likely their neighbours, had derived the name of their language. In the tablets from Kanesh II, Hattic, i.e. non-Indo- European names, predominate, but certain Indo- European names are recognizable.70 It is, however, important to note that none of these are unmis- takably Hittite (i.e. nasili).7 This suggests that in the twentieth century B.c. the Hittites may not yet have arrived in Central Anatolia. The first nasili names occur in the Kanesh Ib period, contemporary with Pithana and Anita, the first of whom con- quered Nesa." The inference is obvious: between 900oo and 185o the Hittites arrived in Central Ana- tolia, settled in Nesa and became the subjects of Pithana, king of Kussara, after the conquest of that city. This fits the migration which we have traced into Central Anatolia c.900oo admirably. It is significant that Labarna, the founder of the Hittite Old Kingdom c.1750 B.c. and ancestor of a long line of Hittite kings, was a king of Kussara. In the fifty years between the death of the last Hattic king, Anita, and the rise of Labarna, the Hittites may have made themselves masters of the king- dom.73 The interest taken in the early history of Kussara by the Hittites probably reflects the im- portant role played by that state in establishing a supremacy in Central Anatolia, inherited by the first Hittite kingdom. Although the location of Kussara is still disputed, we have elsewhere brought forward arguments that it may have been at Alishar, a great Middle Bronze Age city which appears to fulfill all the require- ments.7" The position of Nesa can be inferred from the texts: as the surrounding Hattic kingdoms of Hattus, the predecessor of Hattusa, the Hittite capital at Boghazk6y, Zalpa, mentioned as lying near the "sea," i.e. the Great Salt Lake, and Puru- shattum, to be located in the Aksaray region, were not conquered before Anita's reign, Nesa must be sought nearer Kussara. The Kirsehir region, with its numerous sites, seems the most likely region in which to locate it and archaeological evidence sug- gests that it was here that the Hittite invaders first settled. The original homeland of the Hittites cannot yet be defined, but the lack of any material culture among these invaders suggests that they came from beyond the area of Middle Eastern civilization. As the latter flourished approximately up to the foot 66 The name of the King of Mama is Hurrian, cf. Anis hurpi, king of Hassum and Zaruar in the Mari period.

The Hittite hymn to the Sun God, quoted by F. Sommer,75 which describes the sun rising out of the sea, may contain an old memory from the days when they lived near the western shore of the Caspian. THE EFFECT OF THE HITTITE INVASION ON NORTHWESTERN ANATOLIA Although there is no evidence, textual or archae- ological, that the Hittites themselves ever settled beyond the western bend of the Halys, their entry into Central Anatolia is liable to have caused a fair amount of displacement among the local popula- tion, e.g. in the Kirsehir region. The expulsion of the latter into the Ankara region we have already discussed. On agricultural land as poor as that of this region, overcrowding would be disastrous and it is therefore not surprising to find that a move- ment into the more fertile Eskisehir plain took place. The villages in this well populated plain were not easily defensible and the desertion of many sites suggests something like a massive flight to the west. Two roads were open to them,7" one leading down to the region round the Lake of Iznik and the Sea of Marmora, the other through the hills to Kiitahya, Balikesir and the Troad. Blocking the latter road, the two great sites of K6prii6ren and Tavsanli probably offered resist- ance and were destroyed. In the Balikesir plain and at Yortan, the ceme- teries, and therefore the settlements also, come to an abrupt end c.900oo and their population must have fled. Some new elements in level VI at Beyce- sultan" in the Upper Maeander valley seem to be at home here and were probably introduced by refugees from that region or its immediate neigh- bourhood. How large were the contingents of people on the move in Northwestern Anatolia cannot be as- sessed, but the greatly reduced population of the Eskisehir plain sharply contrasts with the numerous settlements there in the Early Bronze Age. The movement from this plain alone, to which should be added contingents from the areas they passed through, may have involved a considerable popu- lation. When in the Troad at last the Aegean coast was reached, overpopulation in the fertile but limited coastal plain must have become acute. In the mountainous Troad, the few plains and valleys were certainly unable to cope with such an increase of population. Troy itself was not destroyed, but the culture which supersedes that of Troy V is a different one, though closely related." Certain old elements79 survived in the following centuries and it becomes clear that some of the old inhabitants must have gone on living there side by side with newcomers. Of the new cultural features introduced the so- called Minyan ware stands out. Grey Minyan is the most characteristic, though red and buff also appear. C. W. Blegen considers this new pottery to be one of the main features of a cultural break and not unnaturally he linked this ware with that of Greece, introduced at about the same time (c.900oo B.c.). He considers that the ware was introduced in the Troad by a branch of the people who intro- duced it into Greece at the beginning of the Middle Helladic period."8 Among the other changes the first appearance of the horse must be mentioned. Cremation does not appear until c.i400oo and argu- ments based on the house plans are inconclusive, as houses of the early Troy VI period number only a few.8" Recent developments in West Anatolian archae- ology have gone far towards solving the problem of the Minyan ware, which is of primary impor- tance for determining the origin of the Middle Helladic culture and its bearers. THE PROBLEM OF THE MINYAN WARE The so-called Minyan ware does not appear in Greece until the beginning of the Middle Helladic period and most scholars hold that it is of foreign origin. Attempts to deny this have been singularly unsuccessful,83 for, though grey ware was made before in Greece, it is neither common in the E.H.III period, nor do any of the characteristic 76 F.

Three main features of the wheel-made Minyan ware are worth bearing in mind: a) the shapes are highly metallic, indicat- ing metal prototypes; b) grey, red and yellow Min- yan are found, no doubt imitating silver, copper and gold, and c) the curious technique of the grey Minyan, which leaves the vessel with a soapy touch. Grey Minyan is the earliest of these three cate- gories,84 red and buff are also found, but the latter is generally late and has lost most of its angularity, typical for the earliest Minyan. The distribution of Minyan ware is interesting; it covers most of Mainland Greece and its centre appears to lie in Boeotia.5 Local variants are found in the Argolid and Laconia (Argive [black] and red Minyan),"8 in Thessaly,87 and in Aetolia88 (Thermon with a bluish grey, probably late Min- yan). The Thessalian ware is clumsy and occurs in a variety of colours ranging from yellow, brown and red to grey and black, and is easily distin- guished from genuine imported Minyan. It lacks the characteristic shapes of goblets and the grooved decoration. Pteleon on the Gulf of Pagasae, on the other hand, produced genuine Minyan ware, which according to C. W. Blegen offers particularly close parallels to the Grey Minyan ware found at Troy in the early phase of the sixth citadel.89 Grey Min- yan also occurs at Molyvopyrgo and Hagios Mamas on the Chalcidian peninsula"9 and was imported into the Cyclades."' Its origin has been much debated and two main theories advanced, one advocating a Macedonian,92 the other a Northwest Anatolian origin."3 In the later phases of the Macedonian E.B.A., grey slipped hand-made cups and mugs with high flung strap handles appear, but the characteristic features of the Middle Helladic Minyan ware are absent. These cups have many Northwest Anatolian parallels and it would seem that the shapes origi- nated there."' W. A. Heurtley denies a local de- velopment of this ware into the typical wheel-made Minyan of Molyvopyrgo,95 and there is little in favour of a Macedonian origin. Recent discoveries in Bulgaria have likewise produced nothing from which the Minyan ware could have descended, but in Anatolia new evidence has been forthcoming. It would appear that in discussing the origins of Minyan ware Aegean archaeologists have perhaps laid a little too much stress"9 on the colour and the technique of the grey Minyan ware, which are to a certain extent due to local clays and the degree and manner of firing. The centre of this peculiar Grey ware appears to lie in Boeotia and it may well be asked, when areas as near as the Argolid cannot produce the same variety, whether one can really insist on this feature in tracing the origin of the ware. In Anatolia, for instance, soapy grey wares are found at different times in different districts. Some of the Troy V grey ware is soapy and so is much of the Troy VI Grey Minyan ware." Some of the grey ware dating from the Troy I period in Southwestern Anatolia shows the same character- istic,98 and at the end of the East Anatolian Bronze Age we find it in the light grey ware at Ziilfiibulak, five miles from the Persian frontier in the Van region." The only explanation is that the soapy touch is the result of clay and firing. As for the colour, grey burnished wares are a variation on the normal Anatolian black burnished wares and though certain areas specialize in producing a grey ware, e.g. Troy, it is never the only ware in use. When one plots the occurrence of grey ware with metallic shapes in Anatolia on a map showing silver deposits, the coincidence in distribution is often (but not always) striking. Grey ware has a long tradition in the Troad,100 but so have silver ves- sels,1'1 probably made from the ore which occurs 84 Troy III, 19-20, PKG 1464-65. 85 Hence its name, from the legendary Minyai, the rulers of Orchomenos, where H.

Ida.102 Local ore deposits naturally influenced the metalworker in his choice of material and the potter followed suit. Therefore, in seeking the origins of the Minyan wares the real criterion should not be colour or soapy surface, but shape. High flung ribbon or strap handles, sharp profiles, often (but not always) ringbases or ribbed pedestals, and a grooved or ribbed decoration are characteristic.0' Other fea- tures include handles placed vertically or at an oblique angle on or below the rim of bowls with an everted or a bead rim. The most common shapes are cups and bowls,"o" and in Greece, pedestalled goblets.05' C. W. Blegen has shown that the early Troy VI Minyan wares are very similar to those of the beginning of the Middle Helladic period in Greece and he quite rightly links the arrival of a new culture at Troy with that which brought the Minyan wares to Greece. A comparison between the Troy V grey ware vessels and the Troy VI Minyan wares showed, however, that the earlier ware could not be considered as the ancestor of Minyan wares.e"" Since C. W. Blegen's excavations, more has been learned about the distribution of Minyan ware in Anatolia (pl. 2, map 2). Outside the Troad, it oc- curs all along the west coast as far south as Bayrakli (Ancient Smyrna)7"' and Liman Tepe (Clazo- menai).'08 Further east it was found inland in the plain of Balikesir'09 and along the south coast of the Sea of Marmora as far east as the Iznik region.110 On the West Anatolian plateau, it is prominent on the mounds of Tavsanli and K6prii- 6ren and several imported pieces were found in the Eskisehir plain.111 Finally, the excavations of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara under the direction of Mr. Seton Lloyd have produced closely related types at Beycesultan in the upper Maeander valley."2 As in Greece, local variations in both colour and shape are characteristic. Whereas Grey Minyan is typical of Central Greece, red and black variants prevail in the south. In Anatolia, Grey Minyan again has a northern distribution, extending from Troy to Iznik. Its southern limits are not yet well defined, but already at Thermi and Larisa Grey Minyan is in the minority and red takes its place."3 At Bayrakli Grey Minyan supersedes the red variety only in the Late Bronze Age, c.I400 B.c.114 Although Grey Minyan is found at K6prii6ren, red and buff Minyan predominate on the plateau: at Tavsanli, at Egret near Afyon, and at Beycesultan.115 At the latter site Grey Minyan does not occur. A soapy touch is only found at Troy and at KiSprii6ren. The date of these Minyan wares in Anatolia is of great significance for the problem of their origin. Although none of this pottery on the west coast or at Troy appears to be earlier than the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, i.e. c.900 B.c., there is conclusive evidence that some of this ware goes back to the Troy V period (c.2oo-900oo B.c.) at Tavsanli and Kdiprii6ren near Kiitahya. The same early date may be inferred for the beginning of this ware in the Ineg6l-Iznik region, on the eastern side of the sea of Marmora. At K6priiiSren, some of the Grey Minyan bowls are decorated with a pattern-burnished cross on the interior (pl. 3, fig. I). Pattern burnishing is rare at Troy VI and confined to the very beginning of this period,"' but the decoration in the form of a cross is not found in Anatolia at a date later than the end of Troy V, c.x9oo. We are therefore inclined to date these bowls before 1900 B.c. Similarly deco- rated sherds were found further north near the Lake of Iznik where the same Grey Minyan shape occurs and these too may belong to the same 102 R. J.

Although one might express some doubt about this dating, a red Minyan bowl was found by the writer in a Troy V context, including sev- eral other typical vessels of this date, among which there was a red-cross bowl, at Tavsanli in a burnt deposit (fig. I). There can therefore be no reasona- ble doubt that Minyan shapes were in use in this region before they were introduced at Troy. More spectacular still were the discoveries of red and buff vessels of Minyan shapes, mainly cups and bowls, in good stratified contexts at Beycesultan, ranging from level IV to level XII, i.e. all during the later half of the Early and well into the Middle Bronze Age, in absolute dates from about 2250- 1650 B.C. (fig. I). Calling these Beycesultan vessels "Minyan" requires some qualification and one might prefer "protominyan." Nearly all are red polished, hand- or wheel-made cups or small bowls, but they show all those features which later become typical of Minyan ware, such as the high flung strap handles, metallic profile, small ringbases and grooved or ribbed decoration. The decorated pieces are the earlier and are confined to Beycesultan XII(a)-IX, corresponding roughly to Troy III- IV."8 These "protominyan" shapes form only a percentage among the many bowls, beak-spouted jugs, jars and other more characteristic West Ana- tolian shapes, and they are made in exactly the same ware. The significance of this "protominyan" pottery lies in demonstrating the early occurrence of Minyan characteristics in West Anatolian metal- work. As the XIIth building level at Beycesultan, con- temporary with Troy III, marks the beginning of a new culture, intrusive from the western provinces of Anatolia (but not from the Troad), this "proto- minyan" must have developed during the Troy II period, somewhere between the coast and the edge of the plateau, probably in the great river valleys of the Hermos and the Lower Maeander, which are still terra incognita to the archaeologist. It is in this same region that the characteristic Minyan shape of the goblet with ribbed pedestal base is most likely to have developed. Plain pedestal bases are common in Western Anatolia,"9 but the distribution of the ribbed ones is confined to the Upper Maeander valley and adjacent region to the south, where they are common in grey, buff or black burnished ware in the Beycesultan XV-XIII levels, contemporary with the second half of Troy II.120 After the conquest of this region by the west- erners, who introduced the red polished wares in- cluding "protominyan" shapes, they disappear, at least in pottery, until their reappearance with dif- ferent bowl shapes in both Grey Minyan and red wash ware in early Troy VI,121 and in Grey Minyan in the deepest strata of Middle Helladic Greece. This somewhat puzzling disappearance of the ped- estalled goblet is probably the result of its prototype being manufactured in metal, the imitation of which in pottery depended on the whim of con- temporary taste. The new evidence from Western Anatolia shows conclusively that the Minyan ware of Middle Hel- ladic Greece can only be derived from Western Anatolia, where closely similar vessels were made in various metals and copied in pottery from, at the latest, the 24th century B.c. Around 2250 B.C. these are found on the western edge of the plateau, at Beycesultan and probably also near Tavsanli and K6priidren. During the Troy V period (c.2Ioo- 1900 B.c.) the first Grey Minyan products are made at Kispriiiren and in the Iznik area, probably the result of the local use of silver, which occurs near Bursa and at KbpriiSren. The Troy V culture also produces a fine grey ware, but the Minyan shapes are still unknown. Then, as a result of the Hittite invasion, N.W. Anatolia is struck by a wave of emigrants from the east, in search of new lands. Grey Minyan is carried to the coast of the Troad, where the new shapes are eagerly adopted, but the use of special clays and a certain way of firing gave them the peculiar soapy touch. The preference shown for Grey Minyan in the Troad may be ascribed to the local silverware tradition. Mounting pressure eventually led to a migration from the Troad, which will be discussed presently. As in Central Anatolia, the migration left no perma- nent mark and the destroyed settlements were soon rebuilt. In the southwest, undisturbed by the in- vasion, life went on in the old way and red Minyan wares spread gradually to the west coast. 1171stForsch 6 (I955) figs. 58-60 (grey) and 85-87 (buff and red). 8ts See my article in AnatStud 7 (0957). 119 AnatStud 4 (1954) 198, 1.2; figs. 217, 218, 365, 403-o4. 120 See Beycesultan Excavations in AnatStud 7 (I957) for those from the burnt shrine in level XV. 121 See note 105.</page><page sequence="11">1958] END OF EARLY BRONZE AGE IN ANATOLIA AND AEGEAN 19 THE CULTURAL BREAK ON THE GREEK MAINLAND The widespread destruction of the Early Helladic sites which preceded the introduction of the Middle Helladic culture on the Greek Mainland c.I900 B.C. has already been discussed above. The next point to consider is where this invasion came from and by which way it entered the country. The problem is of considerable general interest as most authorities agree that these invaders were the first speakers of Greek,122 though it might be more plausible to suggest that the intermingling of these invaders with the numerous local E.B.A. population led to the formation of the earliest Greek. It is unlikely that the newcomers could have wiped out the entire earlier population, which, judging by the number of its settlements, was con- siderable.'28 From the distribution map of Middle Helladic sites in Greece,124 it is clear that the newcomers overran most of the mainland, from the gulf of Pagasae to the Peloponnese. In Thessaly and Mace- donia, however, they do not seem to have settled, except at Molyvopyrgo and Hagios Mamas in the Chalcidice. This is a strong argument against the old theory that the Middle Helladic invaders en- tered Greece from the north through Macedonia. From the distribution map of M.H. sites in north- ern Greece, one gets the impression that the invad- ers sailed along the north coast of the Aegean, stopping only in the Chalcidice, and landed in the gulf of Pagasae and in Boeotia. From there they may have spread by land over the rest of the main- land, except the mountainous areas of Aetolia and Acarnania. The newcomers imposed their culture on the old population, and only in the Peloponnese, in the regions last reached by the invaders, were local E.B.A. traditions strong enough to modify the new culture. Among these local modifications, red and black imitations of the Central Greek Grey Min- yan, extramural burial at Mycenael25 and tumulus burial in Messenia,126 may be mentioned. Else- where single burial in cist graves within the settle- ment became the prevalent custom.127 Among other features of the Middle Helladic culture, the establishment of "feudal" centres with citadels,128 like Malthi, Mycenae, etc. are characteristic, whereas most, but not all, Early Helladic settlements appear to have been unfortified.129 This centralization im- plies the existence of kings or princes; presumably the military leaders of the invasion founded local dynasties. Two new house-types appear, the "megaron," a hall and portico type,"" and a similar house with apsidal end.'18 The latter is found from Thessaly to the Peloponnese and becomes the hallmark of the Middle Helladic culture. Other houses still per- petuate the Early Helladic tradition.12 Weapons are rare"88 and it appears that after their conquest, the invaders settled down peacefully. A boar-tusk helmet4"' is first introduced in this period, but its popularity lasts well into the Late Helladic period. Of horses and chariots there is no sign until the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, and then only at Mycenae."8 Not long after the beginning of the M. H. period, contact is established with the Cy- clades and mat-painted pottery was imported in great quantities, in particular from Aegina, which may have been the distributing centre.136 Grey Minyan ware was exported to Melos, Siphnos and Paros, and locally copied.'7" Granted that the Middle Helladic invaders were the first speakers of some very archaic form of Greek, scholars are confronted with a dilemma. A conviction that all Indo-European speech developed somewhere between Central Europe and the South Russian steppes has become so deep-rooted that the arrival of the Greeks from the north through Macedonia into Greece was accepted almost auto- matically.

Archaeologists have made valiant attempts to find material support for this linguistic theory in the Balkans. Many suggestions have been made, but the Minyan ware has proved to be the main stumbling block, for no satisfactory ancestor for this ware has yet been found there. Some schol- ars have therefore argued that the arrival of the Greek speaking invaders and the introduction of the Minyan ware are unrelated,'"8 but this seems to be an impossible way out of the dilemma. People may arrive without much culture, like the Hittites, but then they borrow the civilization of the people among whom they arrive, not one of a foreign nation several hundred miles away. Since C. W. Blegen's discoveries at Troy, there has been a swing towards regarding the Minyan ware as Anatolian,"59 but as no priority of this ware in the Troad could be claimed, C. W. Blegen cautiously admits that he considers it to have been introduced there by a branch of the same people who brought it to Greece. Accordingly no agreement has been reached as to where the earliest Greek speaking invaders with their Middle Helladic culture came from. One question, which, as far as I am aware has never been raised, is why, if the Greeks had indeed come from Eastern Europe, an inland people should have chosen to descend on Greece, not by land through Macedonia and Thessaly-the archaeology of that region rules out such a migration-but by sea from the northern shore of the Aegean to the Gulf of Pagasae and Boeotia. Such an action would seem to be unparalleled in the history of migrations. Actually, the distribution of Grey Minyan ware in Greece leaves no doubt that the invaders arrived by sea. To sail the stormy and inhospitable northern Aegean requires a fair measure of seamanship and suggests that the Greeks had been a seafaring nation before they settled in the country to which they gave their name. Moreover it suggests that they knew where they were going, for it would have been inconceivable that the Middle Helladic invad- ers, whose numbers were certainly not small, would have embarked and just trusted to luck that they would reach a country suitable to their needs. This suggests that they already had been in contact with the Early Helladic people of Greece before their invasion, which probably followed an old trade route. The imports in E. H. III Central Greece, the focus of the invasion, show trading contacts with Northwestern Anatolia, and those of the contempo- rary Argolid are again with the Troad.'4o When one admits that the Middle Helladic material cul- ture, and in particular the Minyan wares, or rather the metal prototypes and the technique of making grey Minyan, were introduced by the Greeks, and there seems to be no valid reason for doubting this, then Northwestern Anatolia must be the region from which the first Greek migration came. Not only was the Minyan ware at home there, but fortifi- cations, urban settlements, megara, apsidal houses can all be matched there.'' Cist graves are common in the E.B.A. there,'42 and though intramural burial is the exception, it occurred at Hanay Tepe in the Troad. All these features occurred in N.W. Anatolia long before their first appearance in Greece in the M.H. period. Although it is possible to match single items of this list of cultural re- semblances elsewhere, no other area provides so many parallels and none but N.W. Anatolia can account for what is perhaps the most typical of all, the Grey Minyan ware. Moreover, the setting for an invasion c.x9oo or a little later from the Troad to Greece suits the Ana- tolian evidence admirably. The cause of the in- vasion was the direct result of the Hittite invasion which caused a movement of refugees along the natural roads to the coast of the northern Aegean. Some of these, on reaching the shores of the Sea of Marmora, may have crossed into Thrace and invaded Bulgaria, putting an abrupt end to the local Early Bronze Age. This branch may eventu- ally have reached the Pindus mountains by round- about ways like the West Greek elements, who at 138 So F. Schachermeyr in PKG 1468. 139 So H. L.

The other branch, consisting to a great extent of the population of the maritime provinces of the Troad and the south coast of the Sea of Marmora, took to the sea. Presumably skirting the Aegean coast along the old trade routes frequented by them for centuries, they first sailed to Chalcidice, where some of them settled, and from there to the first natural harbours on the Gulf of Pagasae and Boeotia, with which they had been long familiar. Ousted from their own land by their eastern neighbours, who were probably of the same stock, they retaliated by invading the land of their western neighbours. The ruthlessness of the conquest is borne out by the thick destruction layers, the silent testimony of fierce resistance, but it is only fair to add that after the local population had been sub- jected, the invaders settled down peacefully. The peaceful character of the rest of the Middle Helladic period is in strong contrast to that of the Late Bronze Age, when love of warlike pursuits, perhaps stimulated by the rich booty to be gained in Crete and elsewhere abroad, and by overpopula- tion, are evident with each new discovery. How- ever, the lack of arms in the graves, poorly furnished like all West Anatolian cemeteries,143 should not create the impression that the Greeks of this period were unwarlike. This interpretation of the conquest of Greece by the first Greek speaking elements from N.W. Anatolia, based mainly on archaeological evidence, will, we hope, supersede the old concept of barbarous hordes of savages from Central Europe introducing bits of "Schnurkeramik," battle axes,44 IE speech, and widespread destruction. A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE HITTITE AND GREEK INVASIONS The Hittite invasion had little in common with that of the Greeks; the Hittites were both in num- bers and culture inferior to the local population, the Hatti, whose civilization and religion they adopted, but the Greeks were numerous and civilized enough to impose their own culture upon the subjected population. Whereas the Hittites were probably warlike nomads from the barbarous fringes of the Middle East, the Greeks were peasants and sailors, before their respective entry into their new homes. This would also explain the effect their arrival had in each of the two countries; nomadic incursions are apt to produce some destruction before the tribe settles down, and the nomad eagerly adopts the culture he destroyed before. A migration of peasants, on the other hand, is quite a different thing. Their aim is the acquisition of land, not just political power leading to the establishment of a ruling class, but which leaves the old order more or less unchanged. Peasants are extremely conserva- tive and unlikely to change their material culture when they are forced to emigrate. This is exactly what happened in the Middle Helladic invasion. A change in ruling class does not necessarily produce a cultural break, but a migration of peasants does. The Hittites introduced the first Indo-European language into Central Anatolia, as far as we know, but the Greeks brought an Indo-European language with them from Northwestern Anatolia. The dif- ferences between these two peoples therefore seems to exclude the possibility of a simple two-pronged invasion of Indo-European speaking peoples from a common barbarous European centre into Greece and Anatolia. WHAT LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN BY THE EARLY BRONZE AGE PEOPLES OF ANATOLIA AND THE AEGEAN? The conclusion reached that the earliest Greek elements must have come from Northwestern Ana- tolia implies that some form of Indo-European speech must have been in use there during at least the latter part of the Early Bronze Age. Startling as this may seem to many philologists, no other archae- ological conclusion appears to be possible. We may therefore well ask whether there is other evidence for the use of Indo-European in Anatolia and the Aegean before the Middle Bronze Age. In the ab- sence of new texts, it seems advisable to bring the new archaeological evidence to bear on the problem. NAMES IN -SS- -ND- IN THE AEGEAN AND IN ANATOLIA It is generally agreed that many place-names in Greece are a legacy from the pre-Greek population. Most important among these are two easily distin- guishable groups, ending in -essos and -nthos.45" 148 M. J. Mellink, A Hittite cemetery at Gordion (1956) 49- 50. 144 K. Bittel, Demirci Hriyiik, 32f. To his map showing the distribution of these, in third millennium Anatolia, very com- mon battle axes, about twenty new sites can be added. 145 The important element is the -ss- and the -nt- (or -nd-) with various endings. Sometimes several spellings of one name occur: Siyanta(s) and Siyanti(s), Marassanda(s) and Maras- santiya(s), lalanda(s) and Ialanti(s), etc.</page><page sequence="14">22 JAMES MELLAART [AlA 62 Those endings are not confined to place-names, but occur also in personal names and in the names of trees, flowers and other objects,146 which shows that at one time they were part of a spoken language. This should be borne in mind, because related names in Anatolia are confined to geographical and personal names. It was shown long ago by Blegen and Haley that the distribution of place- names of this type shows a remarkable coincidence with that of the Early Bronze Age civilization of Greece, with a strong concentration on the east coast.147 They are also found in the Cyclades, Crete, Chalcidice and Anatolia.148 The earliest occurrence of these names in Greece is found on the Linear B tablets, dating to the late I5th century at Knossos and the late I3th century at Pylos.x"4 In Anatolia, the Hittite texts of the I4th and I3th century B.c. contain a large number of these names, but some can be found as early as the Kultepe tablets of the 2oth century B.c.5O Names in -ss- and -nd- therefore existed in Anatolia as early as the last century of the Early Bronze Age, thus confirming their deduced, but unproven, existence in Early Bronze Age Greece. The construction of a distribution map of place- names in -ss- and -nd- in Anatolia is beset by several perils. One of these is our fragmentary knowledge of Hittite geography,"' another the unreliable ex- pedient of using late, i.e., classical and Byzantine sources for reconstructing conditions earlier than the classical period. For, unlike Greece, Anatolia was the scene of at least one more great migration, which, shattering the Late Bronze Age states, caused the displacement of several peoples, some of whom used the place-names under discussion. The cluster of -ss- and -nd- names which appears in Caria and Lycia on the classical map bears no relation whatso- ever to conditions in the Bronze Age, when this area appears to have been one of the poorest and least civilized in the whole of western Anatolia. Of the many towns with an -ss- or -nd- name there, not a single one can be shown to have been founded before the Middle Iron Age (beginning c.850 s.c.) and many were not founded until well into the classical period.'52 The suggestion that the Early Helladic people, who used this type of place-name, came from that region, may be dismissed once and for all.'"5 The Hittite records also should be used with care, for the largest number of names of this type are recorded from regions in close contact with, or actually under, Hittite rule. In the independent or semi-independent western states, place-names are only mentioned in records of Hittite campaigns, a very meagre source for the geography of the period. Even though the exact location of most of the place- names mentioned in the texts cannot be accurately fixed, an approximate idea of their position is pro- vided by the context in which they occur. When names of this type occur in the account of a war against Arzawa or in a title deed, issued by one of the kings of Kizzuwadna,"5' one knows approxi- 146A useful list of these is found in G. Glotz, The Aegean civilisation (1925) 386-87. 147 AIA 32 (1928) 141ff. 148The most up to date discussion of these is found in F. Schachermeyr's PKG 1494ff with maps 3-7, and in his Die Iiltesten Kulturen Griechenlands (x955) 239-263. F. Schacher- meyr's theory of a non-Indo-European "Aegean" language spoken throughout the Mediterranean and linked to the neo- lithic and Early Bronze Age cultures is based on the occur- rence of place-names of this type, drawn from classical sources. Interesting as this theory is, I feel that the possibility of later diffusion of names of this type has been overlooked. To recon- struct conditions in the fourth, third and second millennium from material drawn from classical sources seems to me a most unreliable procedure. 149 M. Ventris and J.

Goetze's ideas about the location of the various L.B.A. countries in Anatolia: with Ahhiyawa in the N.W. of Anatolia, Assuwa to the south of it in classical Lydia, and Karkisa (with Masa) in Caria. The centre of all three states lies off the plateau, the western part of which, from Kiitahya to Konya, is occupied by the Arzawa countries. North of Arzawa lies Zippasla-Hariati, and the Lugga cities I would locate either in the hills west of the latter country or, more likely still, between Ankara and the edge of the plateau west of Eskigehir. The country of Millawanda, where Ahhiyawa, Arzawa and Lugga meet, I would locate in the Inegol-Iznik region. To locate Ahhiyawa in Mycenaean Greece, e.g. in Rhodes, as is often done and Millawanda at Miletus, not only ignores the evidence of the Hittite texts, but is at variance with an intelligible reconstruction of Hittite geography. Lack of space forbids a dis- cussion of the problems involved. 152 In spite of extensive exploration, the coastal zone from the Halicarnassian peninsula eastward to the mouth of the Caly- cadnus at Silifke has not produced a single site, reliable chance find or surface find, of a date earlier than the Iron Age. Three caves in western Pamphylia are the only exception. Excavations at Xanthus, Patara and Antiphellos in Lycia, and at Side, Perge and Aspendos have produced not a scrap of material which can confidently be dated earlier than the 7th century B.c. 15s A.

A glance at the map (pl. I, map 3), thus drawn with the exclusion of any names later than the sec- ond millennium B.c., shows a very significant dis- tribution. The eastern limit of the place-names in -ss- and -nd- known from Late Bronze Age sources coincides almost precisely with that of the West Anatolian culture province, including Cilicia (part of it until c.2ioo B.C.) at the end of the Early Bronze Age, defined above. With the exception of the name of the Halys, the Marassanda, the related name of a city Marassa, a mountain Arnuwanda and the cult centres of Ninassa and Zippalanda, the location of which is disputed, no names of -ss- and -nd- type are found in the land of Hatti. Ninassa, already mentioned in the Kultepe II texts, lay on the road from Kanesh to Purushattum and is therefore to be located some- where east of Aksaray."55 This region, where Purushanda, Ninassa, Ma- rassa, the river Marassanda and perhaps also Zip- palanda586 are probably to be located is archaeo- logically unsurveyed and it is not impossible that West Anatolian influences were also felt here in the later centuries of the E.B.A., as at Kanesh itself. COINCIDENCE OF DISTRIBUTION OF THESE PLACE- NAMES AND OF THE E.B.A. POPULATION OF WESTERN AND SOUTHERN ANATOLIA AND THE AEGEAN Comparing the distribution map of the Early Bronze Age cultures of West Anatolian and Aegean type (and extramural burial) with that of the -ss- and -nd- place-names in Anatolia and the Aegean, one cannot help being struck by the remarkable similarity of distribution. This cannot be mere co- incidence and the inevitable conclusion is that these place-names belonged to the related people or peoples of Greece, Crete, the Cyclades, Chalcidice and the West and South of Anatolia, at a date prior to the Hittite and Greek invasions, in other words, to the Early Bronze Age. Not only in culture and religion, but also in language, the Aegean and West- ern Anatolia appear to have been closely related. TO WHAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE DO THESE NAMES BELONG? Widely divergent opinions have been expressed about the language to which these names belonged, but they can be reduced to two schools of thought; Indo-Europeanl5or non-Indo-European."8 At pres- ent, the consensus of opinion is in favour of the latter view, and its chief exponent, F. Sommer, would assign these names to the pre-Hittite lan- guage of Central Anatolia, the non-Indo-European Hattic (Hattili)."' This language must have been spoken by the bearers of the Central Anatolian Early Bronze Age cultures. Two strong arguments can be brought forward against this theory. With the exception of one or two, the Hattic area is devoid of any place-names ending in -ss- and -nd- and there is no evidence whatsoever that Hattic was spoken outside Central Anatolia, let alone in Greece. Luwian, the language spoken in the second millennium in Southern Anatolia,"'o shows a non- Indo-European substratum, different from Hattic."s6 These arguments disprove the theory that our place- names are of Hattic origin. Although they are common in Cilicia, where Hurrian, another non-Indo-European language, was spoken in the second millennium B.c., enough is known of that language to exclude the possibility that our names belonged to it. Like Hattic, Hurrian was not found in Western Anatolia or the Aegean. HURRIAN AND THE OTHER LANGUAGES OF KIZZUWADNA Hurrian was not the only language spoken in the Late Bronze Age in Cilicia. Numerous texts show that Luwian, an Indo-European language, was also at home there and it is from this region that Hur- rian and Luwian influence reached the Hittites in the 14th and 13th centuries B.c.'62 The introduction of Hurrian into Kizzuwadna (Cilicia) was formerly attributed to the period after the fall of the Hittite Old Kingdom, shortly after 1650 B.C."63 Recent discoveries in Mesopotamia"6' and Anatolia suggest, however, that this estimate is probably too low, for Hurrian elements are strongly established in the Amuq plain, immedi- ately east of Cilicia, as early as Alalakh VII, c.x8oo x55AOF 16 (1951) 20-21. 156 E.

Wiseman has shown that by this date the Amuq was predominantly Hurrian in population, suggesting that Hurrian influence was not of a very recent date.'65 H. Goldman very plausibly suggests that the arrival of a new culture in Cilicia, around 2100 B.C., the Cilician Middle Bronze Age, whose links are with the Amuq, marked the beginning of Hurrian expansion into Cilicia.'66 In the Late Bronze Age the state religion and the names of kings and queens are Hurrian, not Luwian."7 This shows that the Hurrians formed the ruling class and were consequently latecomers in comparison with the Luwians. Had the Luwians arrived later than the Hurrians, one might have expected the very reverse. Archaeologically there is no evidence for a real break such as might indicate the arrival of newcomers after 2100 B.C.168 It is therefore im- possible not to agree with A. Goetze's theory that of the two elements Luwian is the earlier one.'69 This implies that the Luwians were the pre-Hurrian population of Cilicia and that the West Anatolian E.B.III civilization of Cilicia, which can be dated from c.2400-2I00 B.C.,170 was theirs. If one main- tains that the place-names ending in -ss- and -nd- are non-Indo-European, they would have to be put before 2400 B.C. in Cilicia! THE LANGUAGE WRITTEN IN ANATOLIAN HIEROGLYPHS In recent years, the study of Luwian and of the language written in Anatolian hieroglyphs has made great progress and more and more scholars have come to the conclusion that the latter repre- sents a Luwian dialect.71 There is no evidence to disprove that the Anatolian hieroglyphs were in- vented for writing Luwian. Not a single example of this writing was found in a Central Anatolian Early Bronze Age (Hattic) site. On the other hand, a clay stamp-seal, with what has been recognized as Anatolian hieroglyphs by two scholars, was found in a sealed deposit of late E.B.A. date in level VI at Beycesultan,172 dating to approximately the 2oth century B.c. Beycesultan lies almost certainly in the region occupied in the second millennium B.C. by the Arzawa states, whose people are known to have spoken Luwian in the so-called Hittite Empire period (c.1450-Ii8o0 B..). A graffito from the neigh- bouring site of 9ivril,'73 scratched on a part of a plate, which at Beycesultan belongs to the II or I period (13-I2th century B.C.) shows that Anatolian hieroglyphs were still in use there at the end of the Late Bronze Age. A pot, found at Kiiltepe in the Ib level (c.i85o-i800 B.c.),174 has some possible hieroglyphs painted on it and it may be significant in this context to mention that A. Goetze has been able to trace unmistakable Indo-European elements among the personal names on the tablets from Kanesh: an earlier element which he calls Ka- neshite,'75 and a later one related to or identical with Luwian.'76 The texts appear to be mainly of Kiiltepe II date, i.e. belonging to the 20th century B.c., but both A. Goetze and B. Landsberger re- marked that in slightly later texts, possibly con- temporary with the Kiiltepe Ib period, to which the pot with the hieroglyphs belongs, the Luwian ele- ment becomes stronger."' Of Nasili, there is, how- ever, no trace178 at Kiiltepe. The next hieroglyphic inscription in date is the seal of Isputahsus, king of Kizzuwadna,79 a con- temporary of the Hittite king Telepinus, c.I550 B.c.180 This seal also has a cuneiform inscription with the name of the king in the outer border and is the earliest example of the use of both languages on the royal seal. The first use of Anatolian hiero- glyphs and Luwian by the Hittites seems to go back to Suppiluliuma,lsl who might easily have adopted it from Kizzuwadna. The distribution of inscriptions in Anatolian hieroglyphs in the second millennium B.c. is of con- siderable interest. It again falls mainly within the area occupied by the West Anatolian culture prov- ince in the E.B.A., with the exception of the North- western corner of Anatolia. All the monuments of 165 D.

Sipylus near Izmir and Karadagh and Kizildagh near Karaman were set up by the Hittites. The same applies to the uninscribed monuments of Fassiler and Eflatun Pinar near Beyqehir and Gavur Kalesi, southwest of Ankara. The distribution of the monuments with inscriptions in Anatolian hieroglyphs, if taken as an indication of the use of the Luwian language, is of great significance as it confirms the few references to the language of the powerful kingdoms of Arzawa and Assuwa.183 The absence of any monuments of this nature in N.W. Anatolia may be significant, for there is a corresponding dearth of -nd- and -ss- names in that same area. One can interpret this fact as purely nega- tive evidence, the result of lack of exploration and the absence of names in Hittite records referring to this area where, with A. Goetze, we locate the king- dom of Ahhiyawa. On the other hand, the apparent absence of Anatolian hieroglyphs and place-names of the -ss- and -nd- type may indicate a real lack of elements of this type in N.W. Anatolia. From this area, we have argued, the Middle Helladic invasion of the earliest Greek speaking elements came, but the continuation of the same culture after 1900oo indicates that only a branch emigrated. We might therefore expect that some form of Greek survived there into the second millennium, and the differ- ence in language between this region, the kingdom of Ahhiyawa, and the Luwian states further south may explain the absence of the Anatolian hiero- glyphs. We may just note that the latter are not found in Middle Helladic and Mycenaean Greece either. Crete, on the other hand, untouched by the Greek invasion, developed a hieroglyphic script along the same lines in the Middle Minoan Ia period (c.2000), which remained in use until Linear A took its place in the MM IIIb period (c.I700).~184 It is not impossible that the Anatolian hieroglyphs, invented somewhere in southern Anatolia for writ- ing Luwian, in turn influenced Crete. THE LUWIAN PROBLEM Before discussing the date of the first appearance of the Luwians we must consider the evidence of the Hittite texts. In the conclusion of his standard work on the Luwian language,'s5 H. Otten suspects the scribes of Hattusas of applying the term luwili rather loosely to a variety of Indo-European dialects: Luwian, Istanumnili-the language of the town of Istanuwa-and a kind of Luwian mixed with Hittite. Luwian and Istanuwan are probably near enough to be considered as dialects of the same language, and the gods mentioned in the rituals of that town are otherwise known as Luwian."86 Luwia, the country from which the name of the language is derived, is mentioned only in the Hit- tite law code, which dates from before the begin- ning of the Hittite Empire, c.1450 B.C.8s7 In a duplicate, Arzawa takes the place of Luwia, imply- ing that Arzawa stood for or was part of the older Luwiya, which is no longer mentioned in the Hittite Empire period. The few Luwian texts (or rather parts of rituals in which certain passages are read or sung in Luwian), of which the provenance is given, come from Kizzuwadna.l88 Other texts with Luwianisms relate to the cult of the goddess Huwassana of Hupisna, in the Ere'li district of the Konya plain.'19 This city is said to have been con- quered by Labarna.'99 It must be borne in mind that most of these rituals belong to the cult of deities in cities which formed part of the Hittite state, having been conquered by them at some time or other. It is therefore hardly surprising that nearly all the Luwian texts available come from the east- ern Luwian regions under Hittite control, rather than from the western Luwian districts, such as Arzawa, which were practically independent of the Hittites and governed by their own kings. The Hittites had therefore no obligations to the gods of Arzawa and no rituals for these parts were needed at the Hittite court. General agreement has been reached on the loca- tion of the Arzawa states in Southwestern Anatolia. At the height of their power the Arzawan kings 182 e.g. Boghazkoy, Karakuyu, Emirghazi, Firaktin, Tasqi, Hanyeri etc. See map in I.

Ana- tolian hieroglyphs were in use over the greater part of this area, and over the region where the kingdom of Assuwa should be sought, more or less that of later Lydia. THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE LUWIANS There is a considerable controversy about the date at which the Luwians first appeared in Ana- tolia. On the basis of linguistic evidence alone, F. Sommer and H. Otten incline to the view that Hittites, Luwians and Palaites all entered Anatolia about the same time and took possession of differ- ent parts of the country.'"' A. Goetze, however, the only philologist who has attempted to combine linguistic and archaeological evidence, maintains that the Luwians inhabited western and southern Anatolia from some time in the third millennium and are to be identified with the people of the west Anatolian culture province, including the Aegean, where he assumes closely related peoples to have lived before the arrival of the Greeks.'92 His op- ponents deny any priority to the Luwians and hold that no Indo-European languages were known in Anatolia before the early second millennium. This traditional view may be said to have held the field in the philological world. From the archaeological side, however, K. Bittel cautiously reviewed the evidence at the end of the last war and expressed the opinion that a chronological priority of Luwians in the third millennium was not impossible archae- ologically."93 Unfortunately too little was known about Southern Anatolia at that time to allow him to go further. In the light of the new discoveries in recent years, the traditional theory is badly in need of revision. Our interpretation of the arrival of the Hittites has been given above and the following discrepancies arise between the traditional theory and the archaeo- logical evidence, if we bring in the Luwians at ap- proximately the same period. There is no destruc- tion c.19g00 at any of the sites excavated in the south nor any evidence whatsoever for a break in culture or the arrival of new elements of population. There are no traces of refugee cultures or devastated (or deserted) areas, such as would have been noticed during our field surveys. To imagine that the Luwians, unlike Hittites and Greeks, could have entered the densely populated plains of Konya, Cilicia, or the Upper Maeander valley without leav- ing any trace of their entry or without meeting any resistance on the part of the local population, is unrealistic. No people ever managed to infiltrate into Anatolia. The chances of population (or rather of ruling class) in Cilicia described above, and the presence of Indo-European elements at Kanesh a century or so before the Hittite invasion, show con- clusively that the traditional theory is out of date. A simultaneous arrival of Hittites, Luwians and Pala- ites is at variance with the archaeological record and such a theory must be abandoned. As there is no break between the Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Age in Southern Anatolia (except Cilicia), Luwian must have been spoken there since the third mil- lennium B.c. ARE THE NAMES ENDING IN -SS- AND -ND- AND THEIR RELATIVES IN THE AEGEAN INDO-EUROPEAN OR NOT? This brings us back to the relation between -ss- and -nd- names and the Indo-European languages of the third millennium. These names are most fre- quent in the regions where Luwian is found in the Late Bronze Age. Are they to be interpreted as the non-Indo-European substratum of that language, a non-IE, which H. Otten has shown to be different from Hattic, or are they remnants of a perhaps very archaic Luwian? The general opinion among philologists is that these names belonged to a non-Indo-European lan- guage. Arguments based on vocabulary alone are a poor guide to determining the character of the language to which these vocabulary words belong. Moreover there is other evidence to show that the language which used -ss- and -nd- names was still very much alive in the Iron Age, the classical and Hellenistic periods and surviving probably as late as the Roman Empire.'4 The numerous new foun- 191 H.

Very similar names can be found all over southern Anatolia in areas where Luwian was spoken in the second millennium and personal names of Luwian derivation show that the use of this language, in various dialects or descendants, survived well into the Roman Empire."96 As settlers in a new area do not name cities in a language al- ready extinct in the country they come from, the -ss- and -nd- names must have been an integral part of Luwian. Luwian shows indeed a peculiarity, unparalleled in Hittite and Greek, the use of a so-called pos- sessive, an adjectival ending in -assis or -assas, where the other two languages use a genitive."'9 The geo- graphical names Dattassas, (Mount) Tiwatassas and Pitassas, etc., are easily explained as (land of the god) Dattas, (Mountain of the god) Tiwatas, (land of the city) Pitas, etc. Dattas was a Luwian Weather God, Tiwatas the Luwian Sun God and the city Petas is known by itself.'*" Other parallels are legion, both in Anatolia and Greece; e.g. Atana and Atanassos, Mycale and Mycalessos, Parna and Parnassos, etc. Although the Hittites also make use of this form,199 sometimes in place-names,200 like Hattusas and Hakpisas, its use is incomparably more common in Luwian, from which the Hittites may have bor- rowed it.20' Names ending in -ss- are closely related to those in -nd-. Not only is their distribution iden- tical, but they appear to be of the same date, and derivations of them are found in -ss-, e.g. Tarhun- das-Tarhintissas. In other cases the same word shows both endings; Salluwandas and Sallawassas. Both groups cannot be separated. Moreover per- sonal names of this type are not rare; Tarhundas, Sandas, Uruwandas are Luwian gods, Alaksandus is the name of an Arzawan king of Wilusa, Masduri- yandus has the -andus ending added to Masturi(s), an Arzawan king of the land of the River ?eia and Rhadamanthys (Radamandus) is the name of a legendary king of Crete. A. Goetze has produced an Indo-European ety- mology202 for Tarhundas, Uruwandas, etc., ex- plaining -andas as IE -want, "belonging to." If he is right the extensive distribution of place-names, all meaning "of so-and-so" or "belonging to so-and- so" is no longer surprising and the simplicity of the explanation is most convincing. Since these names can be shown to date well back into the third millennium, Luwian of some archaic kind must have been spoken in Anatolia long be- fore the Hittites arrived. This conclusion raises two new problems: the relation of Luwian to the lan- guages in the Aegean which also used the -ss- and -nd- names, and when did the Luwians arrive in Anatolia if they were there already in the later centures of the third millennium B.c.? PRE-GREEK LANGUAGES IN THE AEGEAN As we have attempted to show that the names ending in -ssas and -ndas in Anatolia are part of an early Indo-European language (Luwian), the use of related names in Early Helladic Greece, Crete and the Cyclades also indicates the use of a related, but not necessarily identical, Indo-European language there. Whether this was the same lan- guage which was written in Cretan hieroglyphs during the MM I-IIIa period and from MM IIIb- LMII in Linear A (both undeciphered), is as yet impossible to say. During the second millennium B.C. there is no evidence for a real break in the development of Minoan civilization, but there are signs of great innovations in the MM IIIb period.208 Not only is there a great rebuilding of the palaces on a more unified plan, but there is a change from the painted pottery to wheel-made plain wares204 and an influx of new and more advanced metal types.205 In the 195e.g. Halikarnassos, Telmessos, Xanthos, Termessos, As- pendos (Estwendos), Olbassos, Oinoanda, Kaduanda, Isinda, Arycanda, Myriandos, Sagalassos, etc. etc. Many of these were founded in the Iron Age, others like Sagalassos, Olbassos, Myri- andos etc. not before the Hellenistic Age. 19e CS 8 (I954) 74-81; E.

Some of these changes betray cultural influence from Southwestern Ana- tolia and the arrival of small bodies of aristocratic warriors may have led to a more efficient reorgani- zation of the Minoan kingdoms. Whether this was accompanied by a change of language as well, only the decipherment of the hieroglyphs and Linear A can show. In the Linear B script we may see a readaptation of the earlier Linear A script for the purpose of writing a different language, which, thanks to the brilliant decipherment of M. Ventris and his col- laborators, we now know to be an early form of Greek.207 The syllabic nature of the Linear B script is so unsuitable208 for writing Greek that one can deduce with confidence that the earlier language(s) written with such a system (presumably in Linear A), cannot have been Greek. On the other hand one cannot go as far as maintaining that the earlier language cannot have been Indo-European on the evidence of the script alone, for Hittite, Luwian, and Pala were written in such scripts. The decipherment of the Linear B script has opened a new chapter in Aegean archaeology, and the Mycenaean civilization has at last lost its ano- nymity. The language written in Linear B is the earliest form of Greek known, and shows affinities to the East Greek dialects of later times.209 It is clear that this Mycenaean Greek is remarkably homogeneous without, so far, a trace of dialects such as distin- guished classical Greek. Mycenaean Greek contains many pre-Greek elements, among them names ending in -ss- and -nd-, but the exact proportion of what is Greek and what is not remains to be de- termined. In spite of the considerable advantage of now being able to study the Greek language in the years around 1400 B.c., there is still nearly half a millennium between the earliest records and the arrival of the Greeks at the beginning of the Middle Helladic period, for which we have no writing. What the very earliest Greek was like in North- western Anatolia in the late third millennium we shall probably never know. For what it is worth, we may mention that twenty out of fifty-eight names in the tablets which can be exactly paralleled in Homer are born by Trojans or their allies.210 When one remembers that Luwian names in -ss- and -nd- are rare in the Northwestern corner of Anatolia, Anatolian hieroglyphs absent, and that archaeology suggests that a branch of the Greeks remained behind in this region, where Ahhiyawa should be located, this may just add one more argu- ment to the theory that the "Trojans" called them- selves "Akhaiwoi" and spoke some form of Greek. Troy is the one city known in Northwestern Ana- tolia that kept up some form of contact with Middle Helladic and especially Mycenaean Greece, as the numerous imported vessels show,211 and its impor- tance in Greek legend need hardly be emphasized. WHEN DID THE FIRST INDO-EUROPEAN ELEMENTS ENTER ANATOLIA AND THE AEGEAN ? We have traced the earliest Greeks and Luwians in Anatolia to the later centuries of the Early Bronze Age and the next question which must be raised is whether they were native there or whether they had immigrated at some even more remote period. A non-Indo-European substratum, present in both Luwian and Greek, makes it virtually cer- tain that these languages were not the first ones spoken in western and southern Anatolia. The question then arises when they could have arrived and from where. It need hardly be mentioned that philology cannot help us here and we are therefore dependent on archaeology. By analogy with the Hittite and Greek migrations we can assume that the arrival of the first Luwians, their relatives in Greece, and the Greeks themselves in Anatolia, would have left some traces in the archaeological records. Working backwards, we have shown the presence of Luwians in Cilicia in E.B.III (c.2400- 2100), in the upper Maeander valley at Beycesultan c.23oo, and of Greeks in Northwestern Anatolia before c.1900oo B.C. The type of culture associated with the earliest Luwians in Cilicia and in the upper Maeander valley is West Anatolian, providing a clue as to where they came from. Moreover, this culture is itself an innovation in Northwestern Anatolia, fol- lowing a catastrophe at the end of the Troy I period, c.2500oo B.c., the cause of which can be estab- 206 Documents in Mycenaean Greek, 32. 207 ibid. 31.

The repercussions of this invasion on both Greece and Northwestern Anatolia were profound and may be compared to the so-called Aegean migra- tion, which, starting from approximately the same area, led to the destruction of the Bronze Age cultures of the Aegean and Anatolia in the 12th century B.c. Following roughly the same pattern as the Aegean migration, this earlier movement of people from the Balkans into Greece and Anatolia is, as far as we know, the only one by which the first Indo-European languages could have been in- troduced. The interpretation here offered is, of course, somewhat tentative, but it has the advantage of combining the results of archaeological research with a plausible migration of Indo-European ele- ments from an area which has always been consid- ered as the possible homeland of the Indo-European language. To facilitate reading, our interpretation of the evidence (pl. 2, map 4) will be described in chronological order. About the middle of the third millennium B.c., unknown forces caused the Gumelnitza culture, flourishing on the lower Danube in Southern Rumania, to expand southwards across the Balkan range into Eastern Bulgaria. In the fertile Maritza valley, from Plovdiv to the Black Sea, the Veseli- novo culture,212 an offshoot of West Anatolian civilization, was overrun, and except at Veselinovo itself,213 the Gumelnitza or Mound culture, as it is often called in Bulgaria, took its place.214 The formidable Rhodope range separating the Maritza valley from the Aegean coastlands did not stop the invaders, who established themselves at Dikilitash in Western Thrace,215 spreading westward to Chal- cidice216 and eastward to Komotini.217 The late neolithic culture of Macedonia and Thrace was put to an end by this invasion. Further west, elements from the West Bulgarian and Serbian uplands218 brought the curious Rakhmani culture to Northern Thessaly.219 This southward movement of the Gumelnitza culture had far reaching effects. The greater part of the area of the Veselinovo culture was overrun and its population forced south. Ele- ments of this V. culture reached northern Thessaly, possibly by sea, but the bulk of the emigrants headed south towards Northwestern Anatolia, the country from which their culture had originally come at the beginning of the Troy I period some two hundred and fifty years before.220 What hap- pened is clear: Troy I was stormed and burnt,221 Emporio in Chios suffered the same fate,222 Thermi was hastily fortified and then deserted,223 and a score of other sites came to an abrupt end at the same time.224 Only Poliochni on Lemnos seems to have weathered the storm,225 but every other site of this coastal culture, whether on the Anatolian mainland or on the islands off the coast, suffered invasion. With the exception of Poliochni and Troy, which was immediately rebuilt by the survivors, the break between the Troy I and II cultures is com- plete. The disaster which also overwhelmed the island sites shows that the invasion came by land and sea. What happened to the old population we can only guess; some no doubt remained and were enslaved, others deserting their cities may have joined the invaders, or sailed off to Chalcidice and Macedonia, where they founded an Early Bronze Age culture of Troy I (or IIa) type, succeeding the Gumelnitza elements.226 Others, including prob- ably most of the island population, may have joined the seaborne invaders and led them through the Northern Cyclades, where they picked up elements of the Syros group, to the East coast of Greece, where they settled around the Saronic and Argolid gulf as the first Early Helladic settlers c.2500 B.C.227 212 For the chronology-see my article in AnatStud 7 (1957).

The Early Helladic I culture has no strong links with its late neolithic predecessor and appears to have been in- troduced by the newcomers. Most of its features, such as slipped and burnished wares, incision, tubular lugs of rather degenerate type,228 bowls and sauceboats,229 which appear before the end of the period, imply an Anatolian origin, even if some- what diluted and obscured by Early Cycladic ele- ments which are dominant at the beginning.230 There is no question here of a simple transplanta- tion of Anatolian culture, such as is the case in the Macedonian Early Bronze Age. The arrival of the northerners indirectly produced a number of cultural changes in Northwestern Anatolia, the most important of which was a split between the coastal and the inland cultures, hitherto only faintly noticeable (e.g. between Troy I and Yortan). The newcomers had apparently only taken over the coastal regions, where gradually (Troy IIb-c) a new culture developed,231 whereas the inland culture of Yortan remained unaffected. The change in culture is undoubtedly partly due to trade with Cilicia, from which the use of wheel- made pottery was adopted, and partly the outcome of a local process already apparent in the previous period involving a gradual substitution of handles for lugs, a diminishing popularity of incised ware, and a change from darker to lighter colours as the result of improvements in firing. None of these changes can be ascribed to the newcomers, who no doubt adopted the culture of the subject popu- lation. During the course of the Troy II period, new shapes appear, the most famous of which, the so-called depas amphikypellon or two-handled cup,232 may or may not be an improvement on the old Veselinovo shape, the one-handled tankard,233 the most characteristic vessel of that culture. The prosperity of Troy II under its new rulers is not only shown by the famous metalwork, the "Treas- ures" found by Schliemann, but also by the great fortifications of Troy IIb and especially IIc. In architecture there is one significant innovation: a framework of wooden beams is introduced in the mudbrick construction, and the use of vertical wooden beams reinforcing the antae (parastades).284 This has not been found before Troy IIb and it is not impossible that this type of construction is a blend of two techniques, the solid mud brick walls of Troy I-IIa and the Veselinovo tradition of wooden houses, consisting of a framework of wooden beams filled with twigs, brushwood and covered with mud plaster.235 This "half-timber" construction is of importance, as it is associated with a coastal (N.W.) Anatolian culture wherever it is subsequently found. About the middle of the Troy II period, c.2400 B.C., Cilicia is conquered by Northwest Anatolian elements and Tarsus burnt.236 A new culture, E.B.III., H. Goldman's "Trojan phase," is intro- duced by the conquerors and a branch of them overran Cyprus, putting to an end the Chalcolithic cultures and initiating the Early Cypriote period with the Philia-Vasilia phase.237"' Northwest Ana- tolian pottery, houses of "hall and portico" type, the so-called megara, beam-construction, etc., in- dicate a change of population, and as the neighbour- ing areas on the plateau remained for the time being unaffected by this change, the conquerors must have come by sea, along the old trade route fre- quented since the middle of Troy I.238 Cilician E.B.III goes through some seven phases between c.2400 and 2100 B.c., before it is replaced by the Middle Bronze Age, introduced by people from the Amuq. All during the E.B.III period contact with western Anatolia is maintained and soon after the arrival of the E.B.III culture it started expanding onto the Anatolian plateau. During the twenty- fourth century B.c. the Konya plain was gradually absorbed into the area with a coastal west Anatolian culture."39 About 2300 B.C., Troy IIg is destroyed in a great 2*8 C. W.

Curiously barbarous pottery, the so-called face-urns,24' appear first at Troy at the end of the second citadel, become typical of Troy III and con- tinue till Troy V.242 After the destruction of Troy II, the next two citadels are extraordinarily poor and there can be no doubt that Troy had suffered some great reverse of fortune. It is not impossible that the rich city had excited barbarians in the north and the ugly face-urns show the same spirit as some of the anthropomorphic vessels of the Mound culture of Bulgaria.243 Possibly they de- stroyed Troy II and settled in Northwestern Ana- tolia, and the low standard of culture for the next two centuries may be a reflection of their conquest. By the beginning of Troy V there is a general re- vival of culture in that region.244 The influence of silverware led to the production of elegant grey ware vessels and east of the Troad the first Grey Minyan ware is produced. We have shown that Greek speaking elements were present in the area by this period and the obvious conclusion is that their arrival was the cause of the destruction of Troy II. During the following centuries they be- came gradually more civilized and adopted the local N.W. Anatolian culture. Although Troy lagged behind, the eastern cities of this group, like Tavsanli, K6prii*ren, Inegil, etc., developed the Minyan ware, which, after 1900, they were to carry westward to Greece. There is no alternative for the arrival of the Greeks into this area before 1900oo, and the earlier invaders were almost certainly the Luwians and their mysterious Aegean relatives. The fall of Troy II c.2300 B.C. had some reper- cussions. Under pressure, exercised by the arrival of the newcomers, the maritime culture expanded eastward to the Ineg6l-Iznik region245 and the Kiitahya246 region, where the old cultures disap- pear. The same happens in Samos and the modified version of the coastal civilization at home in the Hermos (or lower Maeander) valley penetrates the basin of the upper Maeander, where the old cultures are destroyed. At Beycesultan, a series of destructions follow each other rapidly from the middle of Troy II onwards. Beycesultan XV, XIV and XIII are all burnt, but whereas the cause of destruction is unknown in the first two cases, the complete break in culture which follows the de- struction of Beycesultan XIII leaves little doubt that the city was conquered by newcomers from the west, who can only have been Luwians.247 Level XII at Beycesultan marks the beginning of a new culture in the upper Maeander valley, introducing a variant of the Troy III culture, with "proto- minyan" shapes, hardly any two-handled cups, oc- casional wheel-made pottery, red polished and red- wash wares, a new type of spindle whorl and the half-timber construction. During the long centuries which follow this culture develops without a break until the end of the Bronze Age in the XIth cen- tury B.c. and the half timber construction survives unchanged to the present day. It is noticeable that the break between the old and new civilizations at Tarsus and Beycesultan is much more abrupt than at Troy. During the twenty-third century, i.e. during the Troy III period, the expansion of the new west Anatolian culture continued eastward over the Afyon-Emirghazi area, and by the beginning of the Troy IV period, c.2200 B.c., it had reached Polatli.248 The Kastamonu region was reached either from the Eskisehir region or direct from the west by a similar movement.249 It is in those northern moun- tains that the land of Pala is probably to be located and this influx of westerners may indicate the ar- rival of the Palaites there. About 2200 B.C., Kiiltepe, the great Central Anatolian city of Kanesh, was importing wheel-made bowls and plates from Cilicia or the Konya plain; also, the appearance of a great megaron-like building with a central round hearth, surrounded by four columns and benches and sleeping platforms along the walls (the closest parallel for which in Anatolia was found in the roughly contemporary VIIIth building level at Beycesultan) shows that the cultural influence of western Anatolia was not confined to the import of pottery.250 In construction this great building, interpreted as a temple or palace, shows many re- semblances to contemporary buildings in the west 240 Troy 1, 207. 241 Troy 1, 236 (C 30 shape, first occurring in IIg) and 239 (D 13 lid, first occurring in IId, then in IIg). 242 Troy 11, 246 (C 30) and 248 (D 13). 243 J.

By the beginning of the Troy V period c.2100oo B.c., the last independent West Anatolian cultures of the old type ensconced in the mountains, those of Yortan and Kusura B,251 became absorbed into the new West Anatolian culture province, stretch- ing with remarkable uniformity from the Aegean and the Sea of Marmora to the Salt Lake and Cilicia. In spite of local variations, the uniformity of this culture province is so unique in Anatolian archaeology that one is justified in suspecting the presence of a contributory factor, such as Indo- European speech and a similar social structure among the upper classes. The practice of extramural burial was continued, and it is of interest that the Hittites, who arrived in Central Anatolia several hundred years later by the eastern route, also appear to have favoured this type of burial.252 Who the bearers of the pre-Indo-European cul- tures of Western and Southern Anatolia and the Aegean were, remains unknown, but it is very probable that they spoke a variety of non-Indo- European languages. One of those formed the sub- stratum of Luwian, as Hattic did to Hittite, and the non-IE elements in Greek again suggest a sub- stratum, but where that was acquired-in Thrace before c.2300, in Northwestern Anatolia before 900oo or in Greece after that date-remains to be solved by future research.
