Coetzee's fiction strips bare the veneer that protects us, and it ventures unflinchingly into territo- ry of mind and experience most of us are afraid to face. Yet he writes with a sparseness and reticence that keep his work from being overtaxed or overwrought. He treats human pain and weakness with respect and refrains from judgment. At the same time, every work of his explores important sociopolit- ical issues and their psychological impact, and in every fictional act he reaches for the limits of human endurance. There are echoes of the classical in his novels: intimations of Kafka and Solzhenitsyn and Dostoevsky and Beckett, because of the way he fuses the intellectual and the psychological. Coetzee is a writer for our time who possesses the courage and the imagination and the skill to probe in fiction what needs to be explored, and he does so while maintaining readability and focus. Since his first novel, Coetzee has shown consistency, continuity, and sustainability and has won important literary prizes with almost every book he has published. For Coetzee to win the Neustadt Prize at this time would be to recog- nize a body of work that is important, thought- provoking, and of outstanding quality. There are many reasons for recommending Coetzee for the Neustadt Prize. He is a writer of high caliber. His fiction is consistently strong and his prose sparse, though it conveys a world of possibilities in spite of the reserve with which he writes. The quality of restraint has been com- mented on by critics, who point out that, given Coetzee's subject matter (human pain, weak- ness, and torture - often shown in historical context), it would be unseemly to indulge in gratuitous description. The central issue in much of what he writes is what is often regarded as the fundamental problem of twen- tieth- and now twenty-first-century literature in general: how do we witness another's pain?

Coetzee goes a long way in probing the need to connect on the level of how another person suffers, while acknowledging that one comes up short. Another reason for the widespread interest in Coetzee's work is, no doubt, that he writes about margins and boundaries. His characters are caught in between cultural and historical states, and the ambiguities of the human condition are writ large everywhere. Nothing is truly clear. Every time Coetzee publishes a novel, a great deal of discussion ensues. Scholars are thrown into the vortex of serious philosophical questions raised by his fiction, which is most gratifying. Journals devote special issues to his novels; theses are written on his work; seminars, workshops, and conferences deal with his writings. This happens not simply because Coetzee is a fine novelist but because he bravely tackles problems that persist and cause pain and will not go away. He skillfully reveals how a person thinks when he relates the mind of a character - especially the ambiguity and the contradictoriness of thought. The psychology of an individual is treated with respect when it is not portrayed as one-sided or simple. And at this moment in history, it seems especially impor- tant to be aware of how complicated all issues are - and how history and the past do not merely disappear with time. We are haunted by our past and by history itself, and Coetzee shows appreciation for that in his work. At the same time, there is a strong emphasis on the idea that we are also free to choose our actions at any given moment and that we must be responsible for our choices. Often we see Coetzee's characters simply living out the karma of their own decisions and accepting the inevitable. It is clear, therefore, that he writes about maturity. There are other features in Coetzee's writing worth noting and praising, such as his representation of the South African landscape in much of his fiction. The land is both alien and familiar, personal and foreign, hostile and safe. Wilderness and nature, and anything that is outside so-called civilization, are allowed to invade his characters' psyches. The land becomes a force of great power without being reduced to anthropomorphism. Similarly, the culture of letters from which Coetzee derives is present at the same time. He acknowledges his traditions, which are global and international even though he sets most of his work in South Africa. It is therefore easy to suggest that Coetzee is relevant and his writing timely. He is a frequent speaker, lecturer, and resident scholar at various institutions, and his writings on literature, society, and language (his specialty as a scholar) are always exceptionally gratifying.

The author of several books of poetry, short-story collections, and works of prose narrative, she has been a resident of Canada since 1969 and is currently Emeritus Professor of English and Creative Writing at the University of Alberta. COETZEE'S WRITING is firmly rooted in South African realities, in its history and its political complexities and ironies, in the failure of human sympathy that is the consequence of colonialism and apartheid. His writing is deeply interested in wider philosophical questions about language and imagination, about the life of ideas, and about power. 12 • WORLD LITERATURE TODAY • JANUARY-APRIL 2004</page><page sequence="3">ABDULRAZAK GURNAH J. M. Coetzee has produced literature of great consistency and accomplishment. His first fiction, Dusklands, was published in 1974, when the Vietnam War was in its final brutal stages and the race- supremacist government of South Africa seemed invincible. Dusklands makes subtle and allusive parallels out of South African colonial history and contemporary imperial conduct. In 1977 he published In the Heart of the Country, a remarkable and beautiful novel. In some ways it re-locates Olive Schreiner's The Story of an African Farm in the context of an apartheid consciousness and reveals what Schreiner's novel slides away from. In it a woman narrates her life, in a series of numbered entries, as if they were journal entries without dates, or submissions for reprieve. Her life is that of a colonial woman, captured by both the language of European empire in South Africa and by the language of patriarchy. The great achievement of the novel is in its depiction of how interpenetrated these discourses are and of how their authority cannot be renegotiated from within. Her desire for love and reciprocity cannot be fulfilled because she is "white" in a colonial culture and cannot avoid being so. The language she uses already speaks her in ways she cannot refuse. In between these two novels, the apartheid administration was put in crisis by events in Soweto in 1976 and by the death of Steven Biko. These events sharpened the question of what actions are appropriate for citizens in a state of terror. It is a question that Waiting for the Barbarians (1980), a novel of great achievement, addresses with restraint and clarity. The novel is precise in physical details but has no location. The imprecision recalls the Kafka of "In the Penal Colony," "The Great Wall of China," and "The Burrow." It works by analogy, metaphor, and parable to create a landscape - both internal and external - that is recognizable as both the dilemma of the liberal intellectual and the crisis of the life of ideas as Europe and its discourses understand it. As with so many of Coetzee's fictions, the narrative is driven by a desire for reprieve and the ineffectualness of the gestures made to achieve it. Waiting for the Barbarians was followed by a series of brilliant novels, each of which could just as eas- ily have been the representative text for this nomination. Life &amp; Times of Michael K (1983) describes the life of a man of indeterminate origin and significance, slipping through a network of classifications intended to control society. Foe (1986) revisits Robinson Crusoe and is a meditation on how the narration of slavery and colonialism disavows its brutality, and it is also an examination of the writer's relationship to language and to the text. Age of Iron (1990) is quite different in style from the earlier novels. It is a narrative written in passion and disillusion and tells of an age and a time grown hard and unfeeling. It tells of the compulsion that the narrator feels to act, and how she can only do so by pointless sacrifice. The Master of Petersburg (1994) tells the story of Dostoevsky returning from exile to St. Petersburg to reclaim the effects of his adopted son. The son was part of an anarchist movement, dedicated to total freedom, and was said to have committed suicide but may have been murdered for insufficient dedication. Disgrace (1999) is a reflection on post-apartheid South Africa and the choices open to whites. Coetzee's writing is firmly rooted in South African realities, in its history and its political complexities and ironies, in the failure of human sympathy that is the consequence of colonialism and apartheid. His writing is deeply interested in wider philosophical questions about language and imagination, about the life of ideas, and about power. In addition to the metaphoric and allusive address to these matters in his fiction, Coetzee has written illuminatingly about these issues in his critical writing, including White Writing (1988), Stranger Shores (2001), and Doubling the Point (ed. David Attwell, 1992). It is for the sum of an impressive writing career that I nominate J. M. Coetzee for the Neustadt International Prize for Liter- ature, but above all it is for the brilliance, the lucidity, and the subtle complexity of his fiction.
