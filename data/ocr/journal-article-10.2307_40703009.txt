<plain_text><page sequence="1">684 BOOK REVIEWS ms 36 (1984-S5) Klaus Sagaster und Michael Weiers, Hg.: Documenta Barbarorum. Festschrift für Walther Heissig zum 70. Geburtstag. Veröffentli- chungen der Societas Uralo- Altaica 18. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1983. XXXVII, 435 S. DM198. In addition to the bibliography of the books and papers published by Walther Heissig (209 numbers, of which 86 appeared after 1973), Michael Weiers introduces the volume with a sketch of the life and the philological achievements of the Jubilar and Klaus Sagaster explains the reasons for the publication of this new jubilee volume, for its title, etc. The special importance of Walther Heissig to "Altaic" studies consists both in his substantial personal contribution and in the institutions created at his instigation: the Permanent International Altaistic Conference, the Bonn Seminar für Sprach- und Kulturwissenschaft Zentralasiens, the Sonderforschungsbereich Orientalistik mit besonderer Berücksichtigung Zentralasiens, the serial publications Asiatische Forschungen and Zentralasiatische Studien. These meritorious activities are also reflected in the number of the contributors (45) to this jubilee volume, which represent fifteen countries. The papers, printed in the alphabetical order of the authors, can be grouped according to their subjects: Mongol philology: C. R. Bawden discusses the literary devices employed by Injanasi in his romantic novels, paying special attention to the repeated use of certain key words and phrases to suggest associations. Bawden connects this device with the bilingual milieu of the author. Lajos Bese investigates Mongolian folk- tales in the light of the various types to be distinguished in the names of characters. F. A. Bischoff treats the Mongol "editorial" terminology in the Kanjur colophons by comparing them with the Tibetan equivalent. D. Tserensodnom discusses the semantics of certain literary terms in Mongolian: qolbuy-a üges, iraju, toi (toy ila-) and dayu, tujuli, kög fdayun). F. W. Cleaves publishes the text of the oldest Mongol translation of the Hsiao Ching, together with an English translation and a thorough commentary. Ts. Damdinsuren analyzes the corrections of misprints and errors in the printed Tibetan Kanjur, published by the Mongol scholar Dandar Agramba (1835- 1915). G. Kara publishes certain additions to Heissig's catalogue of the translation into Mongolian by Siregetü Güüsi. L. Lõrincz describes certain elements in the Buriat heroic epics by Mansut Emegenov, and C. Ju. Nekljudov analyzes Turkic themes in the Geser Epic and their relations to the Mongol versions. N. Poppe dis- cusses the motif of a grateful animal in Mongol folklore. In his note 2 he points out that some fifty years ago many Mongols still believed in the existence of dragons: this is perhaps not so surprising in a country where fossilized saurians have often been discovered. The dogs xasr and basr (p. 268) occur even in Kalmuck stories. Ramstedt's dictionary also quotes asr basr, while in the Secret History only qasar is met with (§ 78). Igor de Rachewiltz investigates the use of the titles qan and qa 'an in the</page><page sequence="2">ms 36 (1984-^85) BOOK REVIEWS 685 Mongol literary tradition. In his opinion the ancient Turkic title qajan was first used by Ögödei after 1229. In SH the situation is further complicated by the variant qa, occurring thrice (§§ 126, 141, 144, in A T glossated with qajan, while §249 qa boftafu ögsü is in A T rendered sang b. ô'; Kozin reads Kiya b. ö. and translates qa 'vassal', kiya 'adjutant, page'; SH § 280 has regrettably no cor- respondence in AT). Sh. Rashidonduk quotes some Mongol proverbs, while B. Riftin summarizes folkloric materials collected by the Soviet-Mongol expedition in the Central-Gobi Aimak in 1974, '76, '78. (In his introduction the latter mentions a sketch of Mongol literature by F. Lessing: I suppose the paper of B. Lauf er in the Keleti Szemle is meant.) Y. Rincindorji discusses the principles and practical arrangement of a BarJu-Oirad-un Tooli. The Buriat scholar G. D. Sanzeev, who died in 1982, summarizes the Buriat epic Ere Sojto Mergen, and Alice Sarközi publishes a Mongol ritual text connected with an incense-offering to the CaTan Ebügen. The late Henry Serruys investigates the Mongol place names Koke Qota and íaTan Ger and their relation to the Chinese names of the same localities. Veronica Veit edits, translates and comments on the testament of the Secen Qan äoloi (dated 1694) and Michael Weiers the Manchu and Mongol texts of the 1626 covenant between Nurhaci and the Taiji Ooba of the Khorchin. The rituals connected with the taking of the oath are also described. Tibetology, too, is represented by important contributions. R. Bielmeier tries to find out the chronology of the development of the Tibetan prefixed d- over r- to ZERO in Ladakhi. H. Eimer and Pema Tsering describe in detail the ritual Sun zlog met with in a xylograph edition of the Rin chen gter mdzod. W. A. Frank publishes and comments on German translations of historical Tamang legends, recorded on tape in Nepal. When discussing the sources of the Õindamani- yin erikes, H.-R. Kämpfe wants to regard the history of China, occurring in the beginning of the second volume, as directly or indirectly depending on the rGya nag lhos 'byuh by Gombojab. A. Rona-Tas has detected in an old Hungarian source from 1556 A.D. übet as the name of a special kind of woolen fabric, and discusses the origin and oldest occurrences of the name Tibet. In 1980 and 1981 the Sonder- forschungsbereich 1 2 investigated Baltistan. When recording local Geser traditions Klaus Sagaster met this Lamaistic figure as playing the role of the daggãl 'Anti- christ', and summarizes the recordings. In this volume we also find valuable papers on Turkological subjects. Emel Esin gives an account of the 1 3th century descriptions of Turks and Mongols in the works of Djaläluddfn Rümf and Hadji Bektas Velf. Arthur T. Hatto reprints, translates and comments on the Kirghiz lament for Jantay (dated 1867-9), published by Radloff in his Proben (V, 590 ff.). It seems that in this text certain phraseological parallels to the Kül-Tegin inscription might be seen. Shirõ Hattori discusses, on a purely synchronie level, problems of vowel harmony and its influence or non-influence on the surrounding consonants in Kazan Tatar and Mishar Tatar. H.-J. Klimkeit analyzes the Manichaic kingship ideology in Central</page><page sequence="3">686 BOOK REVIEWS ms 36 (1984-85) Asia. Mani himself originated in the royal Arsakid lineage, and, according to Klimkeit, this origin coloured his whole thinking. F. W. K. Müller regarded the Old Turkic references to Kün Tngri and Ay Tngri as connected with the Hsiung-nu. Klimkeit joins Bombaci who regarded the formulas with 'sun' and 'moon' as deriving from the simpler one, tängridä qut bulmis. However, the 'sun' and 'moon' seem to have played important parts in the ideologies of the Huns, Iranians, Kusanas, Hephthalites, Sogdians, Tokharians, etc. The epithet "God of the Sun and Moon" in the Xwãstwanêft is thoroughly discussed by Asmussen (pp. 205 ff. of his edition). In the Gabain-Symposium (Hamburg 1981) Klaus Röhrborn lectured upon the syntax of the Sanskrit words in Old Turkic. Now he discusses a related problem under the heading "Gruppenflexion und Komposition im Türkischen." Edward Tryjarski has studied the Turkic tradition of anthropomorphic sepulchral stones from Mongolia to the Balkans. The papers of Wolfgang and Herbert Franke represent sinology. The former describes, with beautiful photos, the old mosques at Xian, Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Hangzhou, and Beijing, while the latter presents non-Chinese toponomastic ma- terials from the source area of the Huang-ho, preserved in geographical works of the Yuan time. Michael Hahn represents Indology with a paper discussing the eight Nftisastra- collections found in the Tanjur, and publishes a concordance of the Gãthã-sataka by Vararuci. R. Kaschewsky investigates the copper mountain mentioned in the Geser Epic as" the place of Padmasambhava's throne. In the opinion of the author this mountain must be situated in Ceylon-Tamraparni-Taprobane. The author dis- cusses his subject here on the basis of a Tibeto-Mongolian redaction of the Le'u bdun ma and quotes in his comments both Indian and European works. One could refer further to DTpavamsa IX, 29-30, Isid. Orig. XIV, VI, 12, Vita Merlini 902- 907, etc. Manchu studies are represented by the contributions of Martin Gimm and Giovanni Stary. The former has printed a catalogue of 114 Manchu-Chinese titles of novels, preserved in a MS in the Oriental Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The latter edits three Manchu texts related to the ancestor ritual per- formed in 1743 by the Emperor Ch'ien-lung. Three female scholars have contributed ethnological papers. In 1978 Roberte Hamayon collected sociological and folkloric materials among the Barguzin Buriats. In her opinion, an analysis of these materials points to "deux modalités d'idéologie pastorale et deux modalités d'idéologie patrilinéaire." On the one hand, the pastoral nomads are opposed to the hunters, on the other hand the Lamaists to the Shamanists. The authoress criticizes certain views expressed by C. Humphrey. An interesting ethnologic feature, known from various parts of the world, is discussed by Veronica Ronge in her paper "Vorkehrungen zum Schutz von Klein- kindern in Tibet und in der Mongolei." Käthe Uray-Köhalmi, in collaboration with her husband, investigates four Tibetan narrative pictures, illustrations of the Geser</page><page sequence="4">ms 36 (1984-S5) BOOK REVIEWS 687 Epic, and discusses various details in them from the point of view of historical ethnology. In this volume the history of scholarship is represented by Wilfried Nolle, who describes the personality of W. A. Unkrig, his and Walther Heissig's "un- vergessener Lehrer."
