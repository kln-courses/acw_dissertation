<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALOGY IN PLATO "Of all bonds the most beautiful is analogy." 1 Such is the epigraph of the recent important contribution to Platonic scholarship made by Professor Paul Grenet of the Grand S?minaire at Rouen.2 "Man and God, Earth and Heaven, Soul and Body, all realities imitate one another. All, by the selfsame relation, are linked together." This paraphrase of two of the last four lines of the poem which prefaces and in a sense epitomizes the author's thought on Platonic analogy, indicates clearly the ontological status that analogy in Plato's doctrine is seen to have. Though the primary emphasis is given to analogy as a method of reasoning, analogy in Plato, and in truth, is held to be the, not simply a law of being. Indeed, Professor Grenet holds that analogy is not only the law of being, but also the law of knowledge and of action: "L'Analogie . . . est pr?cis?ment la toi du conna?tre, de l'?tre et de l'agir." 3 A comprehensive review of Grenet's book would have to approach book-length itself, for "analogy" is discovered in all the Dialogues, and the Platonic principle and method of reasoning to which Grenet gives this name, and to which he attributes absolute universality, he treats extensively in heavily documented, text-packed treatises. His book in fact is divided into four "books." I shall therefore limit myself to two general questions: (1) What does Grenet find to be the fundamental meaning of "philosophical analogy" in Plato ? (2) Is this "analogy" philosophical, and if so, in what sense and with what value ? i &amp; &lt;rfxwv kOWuttos ?va\oyia.

Anderson I THE MEANING OF THE TERM ANALOGY IN PLATONIC PHILOSOPHY The single really systematic analysis of this term is found in an Appendix where4 Grenet clearly defines his under standing of "analogy" in relation to myth, allegory, parable, apologue, comparison, metaphor and symbol. And his under standing of this word is precisely that which he considers to have been Plato's.5 The forms of speech named above, Grenet explains, have this in common, that they are signs: media of knowing and of making known indirectly one object by means of another. If analogy were merely a method of representing the inaccessible by the substitution of the familiar, he rightly points out, all these kinds of figures would be cases of analogy. But analogy implies two elements over and above the representative factor just noted: firstly, resemblance mingled with difference; secondly, a proportional structure, namely, likeness of relations and not mere relation of likeness. Where there is no resemblance at all between two given terms, there is no analogy, the author asserts: "// nu aurait donc plus analogic d?s l? que dispa ra?trait toute ressemblance entre les deux termes." 6 This would be the case in that kind of theological symbolism wherein the symbol, far from being a natural or even a formal sign, remains purely arbitrary. (This requirement, that there be at least some resemblance between analogous terms, is a key to under standing the nature and the limitations of Platonic analogy, as I shall try to show later.) On the other hand, Grenet truly remarks that there would be no analogy if the resemblance between the two terms were a likeness of qualities taken absolutely. Rather, analogy properly so called entails likeness of relations, not direct resemblance between terms. This impor tant point Grenet emphasizes throughout his book. He shows 4 Pp. 247 ff. 5 See Grenet's "Tableau," p. 248. ? P. 247.</page><page sequence="3">Analogy in Plato 113 in great detail that in Plato analogy ( avokoyia ) specifically and primarily consists in likeness of relations among dissimilar terms, not at all in mere likeness between terms themselves. Philosophical analogy, according to the author,7 is not found in the following signs, that is, objects which, once known, can lead to the knowledge of other things: (1) Signs mani festing no likeness to the thing signified, but only a liaison, whether purely conventional or due to some spatio-temporal contiguity, as in emblems and many kinds of symbols; (2) signs marking a resemblance to the thing signified, but a resemblance pure and simple, not a likeness of relations: comparisons, and metaphors based on a common genus or species; metonyms, examples, apologues, parables, proverbs ? complex terms such as events or situations resembling other events or situations either as one particular case resembles another particular case or as it resembles a general type. Most often, Grenet observes, the apologue and the parable tend to exhibit a proportional structure, as in the following category; (3) signs that present both resemblance with the thing signified and resemblance of relations. "In these instances only can one speak of analogy in the strict sense."8 Where do we find this kind of analogy ? analogy "strictly so called" ? Grenet first cites three non-Platonic loci: ( 1 ) the comparisons or metaphors Kara to ?vdkoyov of Ari stotle,9 i.e., comparisons and metaphors having a proportional structure; (2) the "metaphorical analogies of the Scholastics"; (3) allegories, i.e., "series of coordinated analogical metaphors." Let us consider these instances in order. 1. In the Poetics,10 Aristotle states: "Metaphor ( fxera (f)opo\ ) consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else, the transference being either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, or on grounds of analogy (/car? to ?vakoyov ). Aristotle 7 P. 248. 8 "Ce sont les seuls cas o? l'on puisse parler d'analogie au sens strict." P. 248. ? Poetics, 21; 1457b 9 and 16 ff. io H57b 7.9.</page><page sequence="4">IK James F. Anderson gives examples of each kind of metaphorical transference, pointing out that the transference "from analogy" ( oe dvdko yov) is possible whenever there are four terms so related that the second (B) is to the first (A) as the fourth (D) is to the third (C); for one may then metaphorically put D in lieu of B, and B in lieu of D . . . Thus a cup (B) is in relation to Diony sus (A) what a shield (D) is to Ares (C). The cup accord ingly will be metaphorically described as the "shield of Dio nysus" (D + A), and the shield as the "cup of Ares" (B + C). Or to take another instance: As old age (D) is to life (C), so is evening (B) to day." n Here it is a question simply of metaphorical proportion, or proportionality, not at all of proper proportion, or proportionality. For in its essence metaphorical analogy or proportion consists in the transference, in virtue of some perceived likeness of relations, of a univocal term to another subject or to other subjects to which it does not apply properly and intrinsically. Proper and non-metaphorical ana logy, on the other hand, arises not from any transference of univocal terms, but from the proportional realization, in diverse subjects, of a term that is by its very essence realizable only proportionately, only according to like proportions or relations. The specifically analogical character of metaphorical ana logy, as conceived by Aristotle, consists in the likeness of rel ations or proportions involved. There are many illustrations of this fact both in the Rhetoric and in the Poetics.12 For Aristotle, science is of course demonstrative knowledge, and "all the sciences are built up through definition." 13 But "clearly metaphors and metaphorical expressions are precluded in def inition." 14 The statement is universal. All metaphor, accord ing to Aristotle, is excluded from the order of science as such.15 il 1457b 16-22. 12 E.g., Rhet., III. 2: 1045a 11, 1046b 30, 1047? 15, 1048a 8, 1048b 4, 1411a 1, 141 lb 3 and 22, 1412a 5, 1412b 34: Poet.. 1448b 38, 1457" 11, 16, 25. 13 Anal.

See G. L. Muskens: De vocis ?voXoyta? significatione ac usu</page><page sequence="5">Analogy in Plato 115 2. Grenet does not explain what he means by "the meta phorical analogies of the Scholastics." Nowhere in his book does he treat of any "scholastic" doctrine of analogy. He refers in passing to Penido's distinction between religious symbolism entailing natural and formal signs and theological symbolism wherein signs have become purely arbitrary.16 As a Catholic professor of philosophy, Grenet could not be unaware of the ordinary so-called scholastic teaching on analogy. I there fore assume, and I think there can be no reasonable doubt about this, that "the metaphorical analogies of the Scholastics" are substantially the same as the metaphorical analogies of Aristotle, as we have just seen them explained in the Poetics. 3. The allegory, Grenet says,17 is defined perfectly by Cicero as a series of coordinated analogical metaphors ? pl?tes continu?e tralationes.18 Grenet correctly notes that Cicero's ttalatio here clearly means metaphor. Indeed, Cicero in this place refers to Aristotle's strictures on the abuse or excessive use of metaphor.19 Is the Platonic myth excluded from the class of analogies "in the strict sense"? Grenet states20 that the myth, in the ethnological sense, is a crude belief to which the believer attributes no other meaning than the immediate one that the words themselves convey. But a myth may be interpreted or explicated allegorically and so become an analogical represent ation, for it then exhibits a resemblance of relations with the object signified. The author maintains that not all the Platonic apud Aristotelem (Groningen, Holland, 1943), a doctoral dissertation which traces the use of the term avaXoyia throughout the Aristotelian corpus. Dr, Muskens finds this concept to have considerable significance in the logical works, in the writings on rhetoric, poetics, physics, astronomy metaphysics, biology, botany, zoology, psychology, ethics, politics. Indeec, avaXoyia appears to be absent from none of the authentic works of Aristotle. i? P. 247.

Anderson myths are allegorical, nor, therefore, analogical, because some of them do not rest upon or manifest a proportional structure. Many of the myths, however, are analogical "in the strict sense"; for example 21: the myth of the &lt;f&gt;povpd in the Ph do (62B), of the winged horses and charioteers of the gods in the Pheedrus (246), of the battered and encrusted sea-god in the Republic (X, 61 IB), of the Atlantis in the Timaeus (20-26) and the Critias (108D-121C), Aristophanes' myth on the origin of sexual attraction in the Symposium (189D ft7.), the myth of the nomothete who gives laws to language in the Cratylus (388E), of the birth and decay of the Ideal City in the Repub lic (II, VIII, IX), the genetic cosmogony of the Timaeus. It seems that for Grenet the essence of Platonic analogy lies in metaphorical proportionality. It is significant that he does not in his systematic analysis of the meaning of avakoyia take into account the non-metaphorical concept of proportion ality that plays such an important part in the philosophical and scientific thought of Aristotle and the Thomists. Indeed I have found in Professor Grenet's book no mention whatever of this concept. I do not however suggest that the Thomistic metaphysical analogy of proper proportionality is to be equated with the Aristotelian concept of analogy even as it is presented, fragmentarily, in the Metaphysics and the Nicomachean Ethics, to name the most important Aristotelian philosophical loci. II THE PHILOSOPHICAL VALUE OF PLATONIC ANALOGY Professor Grenet attributes the master-idea of his work to two statements made by two men, one the Dominican phil osopher H. D. Gardeil: "If the Aristotelian theory of the analogy of being was not in fact made explicit nor was exploited by Plato, nevertheless it is virtually included in the 21 P. 170, note 616.</page><page sequence="7">Analogy in Plato 117 thesis of the Sophist," 22 the other, an anonymous reviewer of Father Gardeil's book: "It would not be difficult to demon state in the work of Plato (whom the philosophers so much love to oppose to Aristotle, while the historians are tempted to reconcile him and his disciple) the origin of analogy, along with the positing (position) of the diversity of being."23 Both of these remarks, I think, can be misleading. In the first place, to my knowledge no complete, definitive study of Aristotle's theory of analogy has ever been made. Above all, no one, as far as I know, has determined precisely what the phrase "analogy of being" signifies or can signify in Aristotle. Has analogy in Aristotle an ontological status ? If so, what is it ? These and derivative questions I believe have not been really answered. In my opinion, Father Gardeil's statement, because of its vague and unsubstantiated character, could not but be an unsatisfactory guide. The second statement, that of the anonymous reviewer, is partly vague and partly false. For the question of course is: The origin of what analogy? I think that Grenet's book shows that metaphorical or symbolic proportionality, specifically as a method of philosophical (though not yet strictly demonstrative) reasoning, originates or rather comes to something like full flower in Plato. The last phrase in the anonymous writer's remark, however, is simply false. There is no diversity of being ("diversit? de l'?tre') in Plato; and I shall argue presently that for this very reason there is in Plato no philosophical analogy "in the strict sense." Analogy, according to Professor Grenet, exhibits at once resemblance with the object signified and resemblance of rel ations: "? la [ois ressemblance avec le signifi? et ressemblance de rapports." 24 Toward the beginning of his book 25 he had said that, to be rigorous, an analogy must imply three elements: (1) likeness mingled with unlikeness ("ressemblance m?l?e de 22 H. D. Gardeil, O.P., Les ?tapes de la philosophie id?aliste (1935 edition), p. 45. 23 P. 15. 24 p. 248. 25 P. IL</page><page sequence="8">118 James F. Anderson dissemblance"), (2) two terms belonging to two heterogeneous orders of reality, or at least to two irreducible levels of intel ligibility, (3) likeness of relations between the terms, in con tradistinction to mere likeness of qualities or of things. It is in this last "element," Grenet rightly observes, that analogy essentially consists; analogy posits not a relation of likeness but a likeness of relation.26 "The anticipations and the divin ations of the poet, the discoveries and the hypotheses of the savant, the principles and the transcendentals of the philosopher, the dogmatic speculations of the theologian, all rest upon ana logy. Poetic metaphors, scientific theories, philosophical system atization, theological illustration, all are based upon a likeness between the familiar relations that two terms present in human experience and the similar relations exhibited by two other terms which in themselves escape our apprehension. Literary analogy, scientific analogy, philosophic analogy, theological analogy, when they are rigorous, all have as their foundation a proportional structure." 27 This passage expresses a funda mental insight of great value. Now, Grenet's book is nothing less than an attempt to demonstrate the proportional structure and the central significance of analogical reasoning through out the Platonic Dialogues. The author successfully defends himself against the charge of having thomisticized Plato by seeking to discover analogy in his thought. One need not be a Thomist, he says truly,28 in order to have recourse to analogy: one need only be a poet, a savant, a philosopher, a theologian; and surely Plato was all these things. Certainly this statement is true, though it seems to suggest that the author puts in the category of "analogy" a wide variety of insufficiently differentiated forms. Analyti cally the book as a whole is weak, I think, just because its author has failed to distinguish clearly between modes of analogy or proportion. There is a marked tendency to lump together under the title "analogy" all proportional forms or 26 P. 10. 27 Pp. 10 f. 2? P. 12.</page><page sequence="9">Analogy in Plato 119 structures, disregarding their essential variety, and as we saw in the first section of this paper, metaphorical proportionality is in effect made the prime analogate of all these forms. For this reason, if for no other, it could not be said that Professor Grenet has thomisticized Plato. Yet he has in some scarcely definable ways Christianized and scholasticized Plato. For example, when Grenet speaks of the Platonic god or gods, he always uses the capital D (Dieu, Dieux), and he never indicates that the Platonic conception of divinity is far removed from the Christion one.29 Also significant seems his liberal, and for the most part vague, use of typically scholastic terms and phrases, such as: "mode of being" (mode de l'?tre), "divers ity of being" (diversit? de l'?tre), "the proportional structure of analogy" (la structure proportionnelle de l'analogie), "ana logical likeness" (la ressemblance analogique), above all, "like ness of relations" (la similitude des rapports). I wish to state emphatically, however, that nothing I have said or will say in this paper is to be taken as destructive criticism of the work under consideration. Platonic scholarship is under consider able debt to Professor Grenet for his identifications and expo sitions of the proportional structure of Plato's religious, mythical, theological, mathematical, aesthetic, moral, political, and onto logical thought. In the scholarly, that is, the fundamentally historical, part of his work lies its primary worth; its speculative value, though by no means negligible, is comparatively much less, for this reason: the author's claim that analogy in Plato has attained to the level of philosophical science, has not been substantiated, and yet speculatively the success of the book depends absolutely upon the substantiation of that claim. It seems to Professor Grenet that in Plato's hands analogical reasoning can have and in some instances does have the same degree of demon 29 I think it has been established that Plato speaks of god or gods indifferently, that he is never fully monotheistic, that for him the gods were inferior to the Ideas (which, though not gods, are more "divine" than the gods), that there is no evidence that Plato identified "God" with the Idea of the Good.

Anderson strative rigor and of certitude, in purely philosophical contexts, as have mathematical demonstrations of the fourth term in geometrical proportions.30 The demonstrative or scientific char acter of Platonic "philosophical analogy" appears to be the primary assumption on which Grenet's work rests. I find no proof of the truth of that assumption. On the contrary, if Platonic analogy, though consisting essentially in proportional likeness, nevertheless at the same time has a basically meta phorical or symbolic character, then as far as I can see it cannot support philosophically demonstrative argument. In saying that "Plato recognized in the first place that proportion or analogy is an admirable instrument for the ident ification of the diverse," 31 Professor Grenet undoubtedly has put his finger upon a point indispensable for the understanding of a great many of the most important Platonic argumentations, but he has also made a statement that is historically false. He should have said "different," not "diverse." For "diverse" properly means simple otherness, whereas what Grenet (and Plato) had in mind is difference, that is, relative otherness. Here we reach the center of the problem. Analogy in the properly philosophical sense is not, I submit, a likeness of relations or proportions among different (and therefore like) things, but among things simply diverse in their being. Grenet, I have no doubt, is perfectly correct in holding that for Plato analogy in the strict sense entails at once resemblance mingled with difference, and likeness of relations.32 It is because analogy in Plato is a proportional unity of terms relatively the same and relatively different that it can consist in the metaphorical or symbolic transference of univocal notions in virtue of relational likenesses. That Plato constantly makes use of this concept of analogy as an instrument for identifying terms that are heterogeneous, though not simply diverse, there can be no question. Grenet exposes this analogical method and this analogical structure thoroughly, with respect to a large 30 See the explicit statement of this opinion on page 152, with note 539. 3i P. 109. 32 Pp. 247, 249, et alibi passim.</page><page sequence="11">Analogy in Plato 121 number of the most celebrated Platonic texts.33 These cases, as far as I can determine, are either metaphorical proportional ities, of varying complexity, or proportionalities among terms generically and/or specifically different from one another, that is, between terms formally univocal, however universal in extension they may be conceived to be. There are here no metaphysical analogies of proper proportionality: proportional ities among terms simply other or diverse with respect to exist ence or mode of realization, the only likeness lying in their mutual proportions or relations. Ultimately a philosopher's theory of analogy is unintel ligible apart from his doctrine of being. In the last analysis the determination of the philosophical value of Platonic analogy goes hand-in-hand with the understanding of Platonic ontology. The great value of Grenet's book is to be found precisely in the detailed, scholarly expositions of Plato's brilliant use of his method of "analogical reasoning" through relational likenesses. The book's relative lack of speculative success stems from the author's failure, as I see it, to evaluate justly the method itself and the results obtained by it. For I think that the method could be an instrument of philosophical science strictly so called only were it divested completely of symbolism or meta phor, and thus of univocity; yet analogy in Plato seems to remain essentially a method whereby univocal concepts are transposed via symbolic proportionalities to contexts not imme diately accessible to our natural experiential knowledge. The comparative analytical inefficacy and speculative weakness of Professor Grenet's work, result, in turn, from the author's inadequate grasp of the ontological substructure or super structure of Plato's thought. Grenet says that Plato was un aware of "the analogical structure of the notion of being." 34 I take it he means that Plato did not have in mind what Thomists commonly call "the analogy of being," namely, the doctrine of the proportional predication of ens ? though this doctrine is variously understood even among Thomists, not to 33 See especially Chapters 5, 6 and 7. 34 Pp. 15 f.</page><page sequence="12">122 James F. Anderson mention non-Thomistic Scholastics. Of course Plato could not have been aware of these developments and problems. But the explicit thesis of Professor Grenet's work is that "Plato never theless stands at the origin of the philosophical employment of analogy. Not [Grenet explains] that Plato himself alone invented this method, nor even explicitly and systematically developed it. Yet, having received from his predecessors and contemporaries the 'analogy' they utilized in particular domains (notably the religious, the artistic and the mathematical, along with the fields wherein the latter was already in Plato's time exerting its influence), Plato transposed to the properly philo sophical plane these very [analogical] methods, whose limit less fecundity he was the first to perceive." 35 The question is whether those analogical procedures are fecund in respect of philosophical science. I think that enough has been said to show that essentially and radically they are not. The true ultimate cause of this scientific or demonstrative infer tility of Platonic analogy must be sought in the Platonic onto logy ? specifically, I venture to maintain, in the doctrine of the communion of being (to ov), not-being (to /jltj ?V), same (to Tavrov), and other (to O repov) .36 These terms are re lated as follows: being: same: not-being: other. This is perhaps the primary ontological analogy in Plato. Now, for Plato the essence of being is self-sameness; really to be is to be per manently self-identical (avrb kolO air?). Being and not-being are variables between which these are innumerable degrees of reality, and all relations of being and not-being are relations of sameness and otherness.37 Of this there can be no doubt. "Then not-being," says the Stranger in the Sophist,*8 "neces sarily exists in the case of motion and of all classes or kinds. For the nature of the other (r? OaT?pov c^vcrt?) entering into them all, makes each of them other than being, and so not being; and therefore of all of them we truly say that they are 35 P. 16. 36 Cf. Sophist, 256E - 257A. 37 Cf. Gilson: Being and Some Philosophers (Toronto, 1949), pp. 10 ff. 38 256E.</page><page sequence="13">Analogy in Plato 123 not; and again, inasmuch as they partake of being, that they are and are beings (ovtcl)." "Every one of the Forms [or Kinds], then, has plurality of being and an unlimited amount of not being." In other words, "being is not, in respect of as many other things as there are; for not being these, it is its own unique self, and is not the other things, which are infinite in number."39 Thus "not-being... is one among many kinds (y Prj) and is distributed throughout all reality."40 In sum: "There is a communion of classes or kinds [all entities are mutually related ] and... being and difference or otherness traverse all beings and mutually interpenetrate, so that the Other partakes of being, and by reason of this participation is and yet is not that of which it partakes, but is other, and being other than being, not-being clearly must be. And again, being, through partaking of the Other becomes a class other than the remaining classes, and being other than all of them, is not each one of them, and is not all the rest, so that undoubtedly there is an infinity of cases in which being is not, and all others, whether regarded individually or collectively, in many respects are in many respects are not." 41 If passages such as these represent absolutely essential elements of the ontological structure of the Platonic universe, then I think it must be said unqualifiedly that for Plato there is no simple diversity of being, but on the contrary, innumerable degrees of likeness and difference, of sameness and otherness, of being and not-being. In consequence I maintain that the ground has been cut from under a properly metaphysical analogy, namely, one whose only basis is diversity in existential act. If any analogy can be called "metaphysical," and thus philosophical in the primary mode, it must be rooted in or founded upon the existence exercised by things. And in respect of their very act of existing, things are not relatively the same and relatively different, but simply diverse. Now, in so far as philosophical analogy bears upon the order of existence, in the 3? Ibid., 257A. Italics mine. *? /??f.. 260B. 41 Ibid., 259A-B.</page><page sequence="14">124 James F. Anderson primary and conceptually indefinable sense of act of being, it cannot but have the character of analogy of proper proportion ality, which posits proportional likeness among terms simply diverse from one another as regards their act of existing. In this order there is found not "resemblance mingled with differ ence" (Professor Grenet's, and Plato's, "ressemblance m?l?e de diff?rence"), but resemblance amid diversity, namely, like ness of relations among terms simply diverse in their mode of being, of realization ? terms mutually other, absolutely, in existential act. Professor Grenet has seen that in Plato and in truth the very essence of analogy lies in proportional likeness, in likeness of relations or proportions. In this insight the speculative value of his book primarily consists. On the other hand, I find no evidence in his work of awareness of the crucially important fact that proportional likeness alone does not suffice to consti tute a properly scientific philosophical analogy. Metaphorical proportionalities, for instance, are not philosophical analogies in a definitively scientific and demonstrative sense; yet, as we have seen, Professor Grenet's cases of "analogy in the strict sense" are all metaphorical analogies. And unless I am great ly mistaken, of such a nature are the analogies discovered by Professor Grenet among the multifarious Platonic Forms and levels of the Real, and, correspondingly, in all the major spheres ? religious and mythical, meta-mathematical and physical, moral, political, ontological ? wherein the Platonic dialectic moves. If there is one word that is the key to the method of Plat onic analogy, I mean to that method's conceptual identification, it is, I think, "transposition." This term, borrowed explicitly from Dies,42 sets the three great themes of Grenet's work: The 42 See A. Dies: Autour de Platon (Paris, 1927), II, 401. Grenet appears to make considerable use of this work. He also draws heavily, though not without critical reservations, from the Platonic studies of P.-M. Schuhl, especially Schuhl's La fabulation plantonicienne (Paris, 1947) and his Essai sur la formation de la pens?e grecque (Paris, 1934). Indeed, Grenet has learned from Schuhl that "Proportion is a fundamental theme that dominates the entire work of Plato" (quoted by Grenet on the title</page><page sequence="15">Analogy in Plato 125 Transposition of Religious and Mythical Analogy (Book I), The Transposition of Mathematical Analogy (Book II), The Transposition of Artistic Imitation (Book III). Now, the first question that these titles themselves raise is: What is the origin of these "transpositions"; on what are they based ? Careful study I believe yields this answer: Univocal notions derived from three main sources: "Human experience" (to use Grenet's own vague term), mathematics, in the classical sense of the science of quantity and quantitative relations, and art or artistic imitation. Analogy arises when these univocal notions are seen to apply proportionately to heterogeneous, though never simply diverse, objects. Ideas that fall within the orders of direct experience or knowledge or artistic activity are extended to realms transcending these orders. Analogy thus becomes "a means of surpassing the limits of experience" (Ch. 2), of going beyond the directly experienced or experienceable. It is clear from Grenet's own analysis of Platonic texts that this method proceeds via metaphorical or symbolic proportionalities. Such seems to be the pattern of many of the Platonic myths. Yet Grenet sees in them philosophical analogies. Grenet in fact argues that the "analogical" myths demonstrate two of the three conditions sine qua non of philosophical analogy: (1) the elimination of anthropomorphism (Ch. 3), (2) the per ception and establishment of a proportion between "the em pirical quality and the metempirical subject," namely, of an analogy between the experiential and the supra-experiential (Ch. 4). The third necessary condition for philosophical analogy is the formally determinative one: likeness of relations or proportions. It is in Professor Grenet's analysis of The Transposition of Mathematical Analogy (Book II) that this ground is made manifest. Here (Ch. 5-8) is the core of the book. The substance of the author's contribution to Platonic page of Book II of Les origines...). The studies of Victor Goldschmidt (Le paradigme dans la th?orie platonicienne de l'action, 1945, and Le paradigme dans la dialectique platonicienne, 1948) fall within the same general line of Platonic research as Grenet's present work. Goldschmidt's studies, however, appeared after Grenet had completed his book (p. 55, note 141).</page><page sequence="16">126 James F. Anderson scholarship is found in his analysis of this principle of pro portional or relational likeness as "an instrument for the identi fication of the diverse," that is, of the dissimilar (Ch. 5), as "an instrument of discovery" of unknown terms and relations (Ch. 6), and as "an instrument of the unification of the mul tiple" (Ch. 7). A significant chapter (No. 8) is devoted to a successful defense of Platonic analogy against the many-prong ed attacks of those who have in various ways charged that Plato mathematized this principle. Grenet shows in fine detail how Plato borrowed from mathematics the concept of propor tional likeness wherein his "analogy" essentially consists. How ever, he correctly points out that from this ubiquitous analogical framework appropriated from mathematics one cannot conclude that Plato mathematized the very content of his thought.43 On the contrary, Grenet demonstrates the purely qualitative character of the analogies or proportions involved in a large number of Platonic texts. Many of Plato's arguments, he shows, are mathematical only in appearance. He understands that Plato sometimes, as in the Timaeus, does use analogy mathematically, though the "physical analogy" employed in this dialogue, he points out, is qualitative no less than quantit ative.44 In general, Grenet exposes in this middle and most significant part of his work the proportional structure of Plato nic analogy. But in this writer's judgment, he in no place proves that that proportional structure transcends the univocity of symbolism. Quite the reverse: Symbolism ? metaphorical proportionality ? however spiritualized, however elevated beyond common modes of knowing, stands out everywhere. I say "the univocity of symbolism" because symbolism I un derstand to consist precisely in the transference of univocal terms (those signifying quidditative sameness) in virtue of proportional likenesses. I do not see how univocity can be eliminated from authentic Platonism if in that philosophy "being" means sameness in essence, or self-identity; if to be really is to be Form or Idea, and if the being of the Form or Idea is the being of its own self-identical essence.

In a doctrine of "degrees of being" ? of the correlativity of being and not?being, of sameness and otherness ? analogy in this sense therefore can have no place. The doctrine of degrees of being in Plato itself sets up the framework for what Cajetan calls an analogy of inequality. This analogy consists in unequal participation in a common essence. Now, all things participate in the Platonic Forms and imitate them, and thereby they participate in the supreme Form and imitate it. Thus the Platonic intelligible world is character ized primarily by this, that in the last analysis all things parti cipate unequally or in various degrees in one and the same ultimate Essence: the Good which, though said to be beyond or above essence,45 is nevertheless conceived as an essence. The point is that, in logical structure and status, if not in the explicit thought of Plato, the Good is a super-genus, a super universal, in which all other universals (logically the Ideas or Forms function as universals despite the reality attributed to them by Plato) participate unequally, that is, according to "analogy of inequality." Participation in Plato entails pro portional community in the order of Idea, of intelligible Form, in a word, of essence, and for this reason Platonic participa tion is in fact, though not in the mind of its author, formally logical, because that which is common essentially, in contrast with that which is common existentially, does not exist actually, but only logically, as common.46 The conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing, I think, is this: Platonic participation formally and fundamentally is univocal, even though it does involve proportional structures, as Grenet has shown. From the standpoint of analogy, the Platonic First Philosophy appears to me to present an over all "analogy of inequality" (if I may give this phrase an un wonted though in my opinion legitimate extension) within ?

Anderson which there are myriad proportionalities of a predominantly, if not exclusively, symbolic or metaphorical character, but no proper proportionalities in so far as the latter are understood to rest directly or indirectly upon simple diversity in existential act or in mode of existing. I trust it is clear that in this paper I have not been con cerned primarily with the properly historical problem of Platonic analogy, namely, the question of Plato's own actual under standing and use of analogy. Rather I have of necessity ven tured into the always controversial area of speculative assess ment of historical doctrine. The reason for this necessity is that the work under consideration is far from being historical expo sition pure and simple. As a matter of fact, the author uses the analogical materials he finds in Plato in order to construct a quite elaborate philosophical theory of analogy, for which I think he certainly intends to claim intrinsic speculative validity and truth. I have therefore undertaken a critical examination of that theory. Apart from such an examination a work that is at once historical and speculative cannot be evaluated. James F.
