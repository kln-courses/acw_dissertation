<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comments: THE HISTORIAN WHO SEEKS TO DEVELOP AN INTERPRETIVE FRAMEWORK for eluci- dating twentieth-century social and economic problems encounters formidable obstacles. Modern societies, unlike Gothic cathedrals, are pluralistic structures. They rarely involve the combined efforts of men laboring over a sustained pe- riod in such a way that a skilled analyst can show them progressing, despite var- iations in detail, toward a common goal. Hence, the narrow focus of most writ- ing on contemporary historical topics reflects the actual fragmentation of industrial society. All the same, even professionals in the field feel a profound need for synthesis. The document-bound monographs-so runs the complaint- tell us more and more about less and less. We hunger for the perspective af- forded in other segments of the discipline by discussion of la longue dure'e. How, then, should the aspiring generalist proceed? Two strategies figure as possibilities. The first commends itself to those pos- sessed of a cautious nature but not easily fatigued. It requires replicating, at least selectively, the primary research of the monograph writer as well as exam- ining systematically the secondary literature. Generalizations emerge from the data in inductive fashion and are therefore likely to prove reliable. Unfortu- nately, archival research on a massive scale becomes prohibitively expensive, and exhaustive scrutiny of the existing works for an extended chronological pe- riod can push even a dedicated student to the limits of endurance. What is more, the risk remains that the result will echo the specialized writer's positivist inclinations rather than produce an original synthesis. An alternative strategy thus appears initially more promising. One begins with a governing hypothesis and then surveys the literature selectively to find substantiation for it. If the hy- pothesis is shrewdly chosen, the outcome may suggest an enlightening way to organize information within a plausible explanatory structure. That strategy, however, also harbors dangers. It provides little incentive to avoid the use of un- representative data. And it can tempt a writer into employing abstract terms in order to obscure the discrepancies between an arresting hypothesis and incon- venient facts. PROFESSOR CHARLES S. MAIER HAS ADOPTED THE SECOND STRATEGY in his am- bitious discussion of Western Europe's path to political and social stability. His interpretation bears witness both to the merits and the disadvantages of the genre. Since Maier's diction is at times elusive, it may prove useful to recapitu- late received orthodoxy and to contrast it with what I take to be his views. Con- ventional wisdom holds that Western Europe's bourgeois elites managed after World War II to sustain their parliamentary leadership and to preserve the es- 353</page><page sequence="2">354 Comments sence of market-oriented economies for four relatively straightforward reasons. The forces of the Left, despite the prestige garnered in Resistance activity, pos- sessed neither the requisite economic skills nor a realistic vision for restoring shattered national economies to productivity. The Christian Democratic parties, notwithstanding a rhetorical commitment to social reform, rapidly became catch-all groupings that absorbed nearly everyone else in the political class, in- cluding the old elites who monopolized managerial talent. Moreover, the mass of people did not want revolution. Whatever hopes left-wing intellectuals might indulge, workers and peasants (where given a choice) preferred to join in the benefits of bourgeois society rather than to destroy it. Finally, the threat of So- viet imperialism divided the moderate Left from the Communist leadership and, at the same time, led the United States-for a mixture of security, com- mercial, and humanitarian motives-to underwrite European reconstruction during a crucial transition period. The Marshall Plan administrators would have preferred, on balance, to manipulate aid in order to advance the cause of social democracy, but a sufficiently powerful democratic Left existed for this no- where on the Continent. Hence, it is no surprise that reconstruction came under traditional bourgeois auspices. The most successful economic recoveries-in Germany and in Italy-were engineered by financially orthodox, free-market liberals. Only in England did Labour prevail. There, the burdens of the welfare state, climaxing a wartime increase in the wage earner's share of national in- come, diverted resources from capital formation and retarded economic growth-to the eventual detriment of the whole society. This account, in Professor Maier's eyes, is too narrowly focused and lacks a theoretical dimension. Both Left and Right, he claims, expected "radical eco- nomic and social change" after each of the world wars (page 328). Such change failed to materialize because of a "single half-century effort" by elites who made clever compromises to maintain the capitalist system (page 328). What is capi- talism? As Maier defines it, capitalism is not simply a means of production, dis- tribution, and marketing. It is rather an overlapping hierarchy of power, wealth, and status. In fact, it comes perilously close to what others might describe as bourgeois democracy. Maier asserts that universal suffrage necessarily brought the "legitimacy" of the traditional hierarchy into question. The capitalist classes had to elaborate a defense for the deployment and compensation of managerial skills, or, as he puts it, a justification why "only small minorities could share the prerogative of directing human labor" (page 333). After several decades of fumbling, they did so by embracing Keynesian economics and instituting the welfare state. Planners in the 1920s had found themselves bedeviled by twin dif- ficulties: wages and social benefits that were inflated for political reasons, and markets that were saturated owing to underconsumption. A generation later, they discovered a way to escape from the old ideological conflicts over distribu- tion of income and wealth by identifying the "warranted growth path" and un- locking the secrets of rapid economic progress. Maier discerns, by the late 1940s, an increasing collaboration of business and labor for "growth-organized welfare capitalism" beneficial to all (page 345). He lauds the "achievements" of the bu- reaucratic state and the highly organized special-interest groups that character-</page><page sequence="3">The Two Postwar Eras and the Conditions for Stability 355 ize advanced societies today. Indeed, these institutional developments, denomi- nated as corporate pluralism, deserve more credit in his moral calculus than the outcome of World War II for the stabilization of Europe. How well does Professor Maier's model fit the facts? For one thing, the diver- sity of capitalist enterprise robs the notion of self-conscious bourgeois defense over fifty years of any precise meaning. Moreover, after the oil crises of the 1970s, economic equilibrium does not seem so permanent after all. Distributive contests do not lie in the past: they remain at the heart of politics everywhere. To be sure, international stability has endured in Europe. But that accomplish- ment derives from the final solution of the German problem through the three- fold division of Bismarck's Reich, from the democratization of the Federal Re- public (and Japan) owing largely to American occupation, and from the energetic defense of free societies by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Moreover, World War II not only defined new boundaries and altered men- talities; it also hastened the metamorphosis of social institutions-not least by channeling state resources into science and quickening the pace of technological change. How could we conceive of the new Europe without superhighways, air networks, and high-speed trains, telephones and television for all, the replace- ment of the peasantry by agribusiness, the extraordinary mobility of labor and capital in the Common Market, and the standardization of taste that makes fea- sible the marketing strategy of the multinational corporation? It seems remark- able that diplomacy and technology play such subordinate roles in Maier's ex- planatory scheme. Still more puzzling is Professor Maier's intimation that public spending and income redistribution provided a basis for balanced growth and an end to ide- ology. Surely this doctrine constitutes a curious survival of 1960s-style Keynes- ian hubris. A generation of stupendous economic advance after 1945 actually sprang from a fortunate confluence of circumstances. These included a new business mentality, a backlog of readily applicable technology, and an abun- dant supply of labor in the late 1940s, sound monetary policies and declining unit labor costs in the 1950s, and relatively low energy and raw-material prices in the 1960s. The experience of the last decade suggests that, in the absence of favorable exogenous influences, the "politics of productivity" (page 345) re- quires state complicity in the inflation of money and credit in order to sustain high aggregate demand. SPECIALISTS MAY, HOWEVER, BE MORE TROUBLED by what Professor Maier has to say specifically about the 1920s and 1940s than by shortcomings in his concep- tual scheme. Satisfactory clarification would require an exegesis as long as his essay. I can touch here on only two topics: the purported "fundamental chal- lenge" to "managerial control" in the early 1920s (pages 334-35) and the motive forces for European recovery after 1945. Professor Maier tends to exaggerate the threat posed by the West European Left in 1918-21. In what major Western country did the working classes fail to fight faithfully in World War I for what he calls an "alien upper-class cause" (page</page><page sequence="4">356 Comments 331)? In France the authorities attributed the mutinies of 1917 exclusively to poor food and insufficient leave; they pretended to view the postwar strikes as a serious menace only when it suited their electoral purposes to do so.' In Great Britain the lucubrations of the Clydeside dissidents scarcely registered at cabinet level.2 In Belgium the population was caught up in a nationalist frenzy.? In west- ern Germany, a majority of the citizenry welcomed Allied troops in 1919 as a sure- ty against communist-fomented disorder.4 The factory-council movement flour- ished mainly in those parts of Germany and Italy where state authority had broken down. Factory commissions could scarcely run a complex industrial soci- ety; in practice, they fell apart upon the reconstitution of effective government.5 It strains credence to think that businessmen woried about the "legitimacy" of ownership in the 1920s or that they took seriously socialist criticisms of manage- rial responsibility.6 Businessmen before the Depression felt quite secure about their social roles. Where is the evidence that the professionalization of manage- ment, the development of multidivisional structure, or the rationalization of in- dustry in advanced countries constituted a response to a perceived threat from the Left?7 Professor Maier believes that European reconstruction after World War II owed much to the cooperation of farsighted working-class leaders who helped moderate wage demands. Direct American aid, he asserts, played a modest role in the recovery. Rather, a new generation of Keynesian-influenced administrators resisted American pressure for deflation and convertibility and generated growth by taking international deficits in stride. All of these claims strike me as ' See the reports on the control of postal correspondence in Service Historique de l'Armee, Vincennes, 6 N 146-47; and the analyses by the prefects in Rapports sur l'esprit publique et les elections, Archives Nationales, Paris, F' IIIC. 2 There is no more than passing mention of a domestic Bolshevik threat in the records of cabinet meetings (Public Record Office, London, CAB 23) or in the papers of the principal members of the War and Coalition Cabinets, including David Lloyd George and Anidrew Bonar Law (House of Lords Record Office, London), Austen Chamberlain (Birmingham University Library, Birmingham), and Earl Curzon (India Office Library, London). Even New Scotland Yard pronounced home-grown Bolshevism of little importance; see "The Prog- ress of Bolshevism in Europe," January 28, 1919, copy in the Edward M. House Papers, box 207, Yale Univer- sity Library. 3 See, for example, Pierre Nothomb, "Dix ans de politique nationale," Pierre Nothomb Papers, carton 82, Bibliotheque de l'Universite de Louvain-la-Neuve, Louvain-la-Neuve. 4 See the striking reports by the commander of the American Occupation Forces in the Henry T. Allen Papers, cartons 11-15, Library of Congress, Washington. ' This is apparent even from works on which Maier relies: Eberhard Kolb, Arbeiterrdte in der deutschen In- nenpolitik, 1918-1919 (Dulsseldorf, 1962); Peter von Oertzen, Betriebsra'te in der Novemberrevolution (Dusseldorf, 1963); and Mario Abrati, La Lotta sindicale nella industrializzazione in Italia, 1906-1926 (Turin, 1967). For Maier's detailed argument, see his Recasting Bourgeois Europe (Princeton, 1975), 136-94, 559-72; for a corrective that emphasizes the limited appeal of the council movement to German trade unionists, see David W. Morgan's The Socialist Left and the German Revolution (Ithaca, N.Y., 1975). 6This is not to deny the importance of the subject for an intellectual biography of Antonio Gramsci or of his influence on such post-World War II socialists as Rodolfo Morandi. The evidence is particularly well developed for the United States-the leading industrial power. See James W. Prothro, The Dollar Decade (Baton Rouge, 1954); and Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Industrial Enterprise (Cambridge, Mass., 1962), and The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business (Cambridge, Mass., 1977), 455-83. My judgment on the self-con- fidence of French and German business derives from reading the files of Saint-Gobain-Pont-a-Mousson, La Chatre; Gutehoffnungshultte, Oberhausen; Verein deutscher Eisen- und Stahlindustrieller, Bundesarchiv, Koblenz; and other industrial archives. Only in Italy, the least advanced of the industrial nations, did an anx- ious business class react forcefully to fundamental challenge-by working out a mutually satisfactory, if wary, accommodation with Mussolini's regime.

No doubt the Communist leadership did try to control the rank and file for two years after the war, but only for tactical reasons-as the reversal in 1947 under Cominform orders makes clear.8 Furthermore, as long as Communists remained part of the French and Italian governing coalitions, they constituted an insurmountable psychological obstacle to investment. Only upon their exclusion from power could secure reconstruction begin. Thus, concrete American encouragement for the Mouvement Republicain Populaire and the moderate socialists in France, and for the Christian Democrats in Italy, proved vital in 1947-48. Similarly, the Bizonal administration barred the route to dis- ruptive radical challenge in Germany. Moreover, American economic aid pro- vided the crucial margin that eliminated bottlenecks in transport and raw-ma- terials supply, coaxed hoarded goods and gold on to the market, and paved the way for the all-important conquest of inflation. The simple ratio of this assist- ance to gross domestic capital formation (even if one accepts Maier's figures) rather understates the American contribution.9 It is perilous to generalize about the economic prescriptions that American policymakers urged on Europe because New Deal "planners," Hullian free-tra- ders, and the hard-nosed realists in the Department of State's Office of Euro- pean Affairs fought a protracted bureaucratic battle over their respective views. Yet it seems misleading to say even that the Treasury "insisted stubbornly on convertibility" (page 344). No doubt the Treasury required that Great Britain stop excluding American trade from the sterling area as the price of its 1945 loan, but toward the Continental nations it pursued a flexible and pragmatic policy.'0 After 1948, contrary to what Professor Maier suggests, Marshall Plan administrators urged deployment of the counterpart funds to boost consumer demand, even at the risk of inflation. The Europeans resisted. In Germany, Ludwig Erhard conjured up an "economic miracle" after introducing a new currency. He did so by restricting fiduciary circulation and credit, sheltering business from taxation, fostering export growth, acquiring foreign reserves to build confidence, and facing down union demands. " In Italy as well, proponents 8 In so far as one can pierce the veil of secrecy, it appears that the French Communists hoped a coming Depression would provide the objective conditions for revolution. In Italy, Togliatti recognized the weakness of the working class and the need for caution to build an alliance with the southern peasantry and the dis- placed segments of the middle class. See Alfred Rieber, Stalin and the French Communist Party, 1941-1947 (New York, 1962). On Italy, see John Harper, "The United States and the Italian Economy, 1945-1948" (Ph.D. dissertation, Johns Hopkins University, 1981). Harper has summarized a vast literature, and I draw heavily on his work below. 9 In note 36, page 342, above, Maier accounts for only $9.4 billion in aid. But the Economic Cooperation Administration actually disbursed $13.5 billion from 1948 through 1952, on top of $10 billion transferred ear- lier to Western Europe by U.S. government and international agencies and private relief organizations. See the calculations in Richard Mayne, The Recovery of Europe, 1945-1973 (Garden City, N.Y., 1973), 144-45. '? For an explanation of sterling convertibility and the sterling-balances issue, see Richard Gardner, Sterling- Dollar Diplomacy in Current Perspective (New York, 1980), 188-268. Also see Alfred E. Eckes, Jr., A Search for Sol- vency: Bretton Woods and the International Monetary System, 1941-1971 (Austin, 1975), 165-236. " From June 1948 through December 1953, the gross national product rose roughly 304 percent, industrial production 221 percent, and exports 351 percent. But the money supply grew only 106 percent. Real wages (from 1950) increased on average by no more than 11 percent per year, while mean unemployment remained at 8.8 percent-almost twice the figure before currency reform. I have extrapolated these figures from Gustav Stolper et al., The German Economy, 1870 to the Present, trans. Toni Stolper (New York, 1967), 247-51, 290; and Ludwig Erhard, Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik: Der Weg der sozialen Marktwirtschaft (Dusseldorf, 1962), 622-23.

PROFESSOR CHARLES MAIER EVOKES a historical universe in which idealism still holds sway. History has "tasks," centuries receive "sociopolitical assignments," and governments are "called upon" by unnamed powers to maintain economic growth and high employment at specified levels of income. Not all of the foxes of the historical profession, committed to a documentary orientation, will find it easy to follow Maier as he ventures on this terrain. Nevertheless, his pioneering work underscores the need for synthesis in contemporary European history. It is for those who believe in the merits of the inductive method to take up the chal- lenge.

CHARLES MAIER'S THESIS IS THAT the postwar periods after World Wars I and II form parts of the same effort of stabilization not of procedures of democracy but of overlapping hierarchies of power, wealth, and status that we can loosely term capitalist. In another passage he calls these hierarchies "elites superintending Western society" (pages 333-34). I would quarrel with this position on two scores: (1) the concept of power elites that make "efforts" over two continents and half a century, and (2) the notion that the two postwar periods form part of the same effort. THE FIRST ISSUE IS QUICKLY DISMISSED. Both the extreme Left and the extreme Right embrace conspiracy theories in which the other polar group makes deci-</page><page sequence="7">The Two Postwar Eras and the Conditions for Stability 359 sions and carries out efforts. Ex ante, this is nonsense in social science; ex post, social determinism may make it look as if such anthropomorphism were justi- fied, though it is not. And the notion of a single, even overlapping, power elite in a dozen countries over half a century is also unacceptable. For an extreme example, look at John Porter's The Vertical Mosaic: An Analysis of Social Class and Power in Canada (1965). Porter is a disciple of C. Wright Mills and has argued that the six elites in Canada-economic, labor, political, mass media, in- tellectual, and religious (clerical)-form a unit. It happens, however, that his ec- onomic elite is from American multinational corporations, the political elite from Canada, and the bishops of the Anglican church from England. To find a decision-making apparatus and a converging effort there wielding power takes doing. To extend the elite to more countries and a longer period challenges be- lief. More fundamental, I find it impossible to accept the thesis that the interwar period and the period after World War II are umbilically connected beyond mere calendar and time geography. Professor Maier tries to equate the interest of Benjamin Strong and the J. P. Morgan partners in European monetary con- ditions in the 1920s with the economic program of the United States as a whole after 1945. It is farfetched. On any reasonable showing, the United States was isolationist in the 1920s and deeply engaged at the end of World War II. He im- plies that American and European efforts at expanding trade, stabilizing com- modity markets, and international monetary reform were comparable in the two periods. I leave it to the reader to make the contrast between the Brussels, Genoa, League-of-Nations-Gold-Delegation efforts on the one hand and the one-by-one stabilization of the Reichsmark, the overvaluation of the pound, the undervaluation of the French franc, and the like on the other, with the full-scale program of Bretton Woods, the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, the Marshall Plan, the European Payments Union, and so forth. Few today remember the Stevenson rubber plan of 1924-a foretaste of the OPEC destabilizing opera- tions of the 1970s-or the failure of the World Economic Conference of 1927, which agreed on a program of lowering tariffs (although no country took ac- tion), or the League of Nations follow-up, which sought world-wide commodity agreements in cement and aluminum but aborted.' The comparison between the steel agreements of 1920 and the European Coal and Steel Community is specious. For one thing, the ECSC contained provisions opposing cartels. For another, Maier exaggerates its success as it broke down-Diebold to the con- trary notwithstanding-and was swept under the rug of the Rome Treaty of 1957. I suppose I should feel on shakier ground in objecting to Professor Maier's failure to dwell on the contrast between the German inflation of 1923 and the monetary reform of 1948. The one mention of the latter is coupled with the re- mark that both Germans and Americans wanted it postponed, citing a source 1 See my "Commercial Policy between the Wars," in the Cambridge Economic History of Europe, 8 (forthcom- ing).</page><page sequence="8">360 Comments inaccessible to me (page 343). The Colm-Dodge-Goldsmith report was commis- sioned by the Department of State in the spring of 1946 and finished that sum- mer. Delay in its implementation largely turned on the difficulties of printing the new money, which took six months, confused by the difficulty of choosing where to do it. The Reichsdruckerei was located in the Soviet zone of occupation, in Leipzig, and there was a widespread, and mistaken, belief in the United States that the losses suffered by the U.S. Army in occupation currency had been caused by the action of the U.S. Treasury in turning over the plates for printing occupation currency to the Soviet Union. When it finally came, more- over, monetary reform took place in stages, the monetary and debt conversion in June 1948 and the Lastenau-sgleich, a mortgage on all real property to equalize war losses, later, on September 2, 1948, when the German administration took power. The delay was the result of a veto of the Lastenausgleich by the secretary of the army, Kenneth Royal, on ideological grounds. He was less interested in stabilizing German society than he was in opposing capital levies everywhere, because they might be infectious. A number of recent historians-Gerald Feld- man, Charles Maier, Stephen Schuker-seem to believe that the German infla- tion of 1923 was of no real destabilizing force-no worse, so to speak, than a bad cold-as opposed to a major force tearing at the social fabric of the country and paving the way, along with the unemployment of 1929-32, for the Nazis. I sim- ply do not believe it. In my judgment, the monetary reform of 1948 was a great feat of social engineering, in sharp contrast with 1923. One could go on: The General Strike in Britain in 1926 was hardly part of an effort of stabilization, although its defeat may have been; nor were Italian fascism and French right-wing efforts by many groups, large and small, which failed to converge. The international restraints on recovery in the 1920s, as Professor Maier calls them (war debts, reparations, skewed capital movements), might have been overcome had there been a consistent international effort at social stabilization. Instead, short-run, national interests dominated, and the fallacy of composition produced the Great Depression, as destabilizing an effort as one can imagine. NOR CAN I ACCEPT the second half of Professor Maier's thesis. In his view, stabili- zation was achieved in two stages: in the first, dissent was repressed in the inter- war period. In the second, capitalism finished the job by delivering the goods. No country sought alternatives to the old-fashioned, liberal, market capitalism. In my judgment, to the contrary, various countries tried various alternatives and abandoned them when they failed. Nationalization of central banks, com- mercial banks in France, and various industries took place in France and Brit- ain, with limited, if any, success. Britain's Labour Government started out to plan foreign trade through bilateral trade agreements, only to find that, al- though it was agreeable to insist on low prices for pre-Korean bargains, it was intolerable to be held to post-Korean contracts when prices fell after 1951. A</page><page sequence="9">The Two Postwar Eras and the Conditions for Stability 361 change of government provided a convenient moment to abandon planned for- eign trade, but the Labour Party was already disenchanted. Nor is French planning featured in what Professor Maier terms the steps lead- ing to the maintenance of capitalist elitist domination. Planning was conceived by Monnet as an alternative to a "resolute market capitalism." Andrew Shonfield hailed it as Modem Capitalism (1965), but it is a far cry from the liberal solution. Maier dismisses planning after a brief mention, in which he connects it to Vichy and the 1930s (page 331). The origins, of course, go back at least to the Saint-Simonism of the early nineteenth century, and it is not surprising to learn that the Corps des Ponts et Chaussees was asked by Minister Roland in 1792 to prepare a plan for the postwar economic order, including, along with public works, plantations, mines and quarries, forges, and factories.2 But French plan- ning, like Keynesian demand management in Britain (and the United States), proved a failure. Like the ECSC, it was allowed to fade away rather than be publicly buried. Maier's surprise that other "collectivist alternatives" were not tried is surprising to me. The economic results of the Soviet system or of Ger- man or Italian fascism appealed to a few, perhaps, but the political costs were generally taken to be intolerable. Professor Maier also seems in error when he implies that all European coun- tries did more or less equally well after World War II. This is not so. The rates of growth in Britain and Belgium (plus the United States and Canada) were the lowest in the League standings for reasons on which economists differ, as they do on those for the successes of Germany, Japan, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and, belatedly, Norway. Space is lacking to recapitulate the various views beyond cryptic designations: Maddison, demand management; Andrew Shonfield, planning; Charles Kindleberger, unlimited supplies of labor. But a new view by Mancur Olson, Jr., runs diametrically counter to Maier's emphasis on "corporate pluralism" of "trade unions, ambitious state economic agencies, and bureaucratized pressure groups" (page 351). Olson has suggested that de- feat or occupation purged these countries of collective interests-trade associa- tions, cartels, trade unions-and required individuals to go back and work on their own. Collective interests in Britain and the United States gained from vic- tory and grew to the point where their efforts to achieve collective gains inter- fered with each other and with the national interest.3 World War I discredited the German monarchy but virtually nothing else in that country-not the army, the Junkers, or industry. The Thyssens and the Helfferichs continued to wield power after Versailles as before 1914, as Weimar struggled ineffectually to govern. Germany was able to accept the equalization of war losses (Lasten- ausgleich) because there were no groups able and ready to force the burdens of the war on to others. 2 Commission de Recherche et de Publication des Documents relatif a la vie economique de la Revolution, volume 9: Fragments d'une enqutte dconomique de Ministre Roland aupres des ingenieurs des Ponts et Chaussees (Besanson, 1942), 2, 9.

War is a hothouse: it accelerates the growth of some tendencies and hastens the de- cline of those on the downward path. In a forthcoming paper, I compare the re- sumption of gold payments in Britain in 1819 and the revaluation of the pound in 1925 and find strong similarities.4 It is not unexpected that Professor Maier can find similarities as well as differences between the two postwar periods. I find it bizarre, however, to conclude that both were part of the same piece. What is interesting, I submit, is how much 1945 learned from the mistakes of 1919, in a world where it is easy to draw the wrong lesson-for example, the Maginot Line-or not to learn at all-as, for example, 1925 did not learn from 1819. The United States, for one, did not try to withdraw from the European settlement-not for the reason that Charles Maier adduces, to keep Europe res- olutely capitalist and market-oriented-and corrected the mistakes of war debts, reparations, wrong exchange rates, and niggardly postwar assistance. Europe's delivery of goods-a remarkable episode in the history of economic growth- was based less on lessons learned from the past than on accident and continued questing, trying new expedients when old paths seemed not to lead anywhere.
