<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Response from Adam Roberts. I must thank Professor Fayter for his detailed and interesting response to my original (as he notes) thumbnail statement. Whilst I agree with him that history is not simple, and the history of the Reformation more unsimple than most, I hope he will permit me, respectfully, to disagree with almost everything else he says. His main argument, that "the transformation of the Earth from cosmic center to planet-among-other-planets was actually a promotion ,"seems to me to misunderstand early-modern cosmological thought.</page><page sequence="2">580 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) "Promotion" assumes a linearly up-down logic, as if the Earth were being pegged up a few notches and placed in a more spiritually elevated position. That is not right, I think. Copernican cosmology was not about shuffling the vertical order of the planets; it was about challenging deep-rooted and at base fundamentally theological tenets about the finitude of the universe, the perfection and mutability of creation - the zone from the moon upwards being conceived as perfect and changeless - and the human scale of the universe. A more profound change still was in eliminating the qualitative difference between earthly life and life elsewhere in the cosmos: "and now what of all this?" John Swan, in Speculum Mundi: or A Glasse Representing the Face of the World (1635), asked of the observations of lunar landscapes, sunspots, comets, and novas: "nothing but onley this ... it seemeth that there is no great difference between them and things here below." That chilly and ontologically disorienting realization is a conceptual breakthrough necessary for the promulgation of science fiction. Of course, Professor Fay ter is quite right that other thinkers before Copernicus had speculated on a circular earth and heliocentric system; but it was Copernicus' s work, for whatever reasons, that provoked the general change in the episteme (even though his book was, in Elizabeth L. Eisenstein' s words, "by no means a landmark in observational science, but relied on old tables and often corrupted data"; and although his was, in the striking title of Owen Gingerich' s 2004 study, The Book Nobody Read). It is also true that Copernicus was a devout Catholic, indeed a churchman. Professor Fayter' s own scriptural hermeneutics ("it is [and was] apparent through careful and contextual study of scripture that we humans are the non-unique objects of divine blessing and covenant love") are likewise interesting, although I'm sure he knows as well as anybody that any amount of sometimes conflicting individual interpretations may be mined out of Biblical scripture. Galileo considered himself a good Catholic, too. Indeed, Galileo considered that scriptural authority supported a Copernican rather than Ptolomaic cosmos - that God making the sun stand still in the sky for Joshua would be easier if all He had to do was hold back the Earth from spinning, rather than arresting the entire solar sphere. But he was missing the point. The Catholic Church did not persecute Galileo, or attempt to suppress Copernicus, because of genuinely felt differences of interpretation over scripture. They did so in an act of calculated Counter- Reformation policy: a means of publicly asserting that only the Church had the authority to interpret scripture, and that the new sciences must kowtow. As Professor Fayter cites the period expertise of Gardner Dozois, he'll forgive me if I mention that Kim Stanley Robinson's superb and scrupulously researched new novel, Galileo's Dream (2009), is very good on precisely this. It is true as far as it goes to say that "those who contemplated 'man's place in nature' (in the early-modern period) were not idiots" and that "mere spatial location did not determine moral and metaphysical value." Indeed not. But that an anthropomorphic moral and metaphysical value had been asserted, nonetheless, was axiomatic for both Catholic and emergent Protestant churches - asserted not by geographical positioning but by the uniqueness and magnitude of Christ's sacrifice and atonement. It is this, more than all the other things put together, that the new Copernican cosmology threatened, and (I would</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE 581 say) that explained the establishment hostility towards it: myriad inhabited worlds would require myriad Christs to be crucified to save them, which diluted the crucial uniqueness of our Christ's sacrifice; or else would imply a God heartless enough to permit myriad alien beings to go to Hell unatoned. Professor Fayter suggests that "the last few decades of historical research" have contradicted the assumptions behind my argument, although he mentions no specific texts. I have read if not comprehensibly then I would like to think widely in that research, and would like to know where my reading has been delinquent. My particular argument is advanced in a book from the last few decades that I can understand Professor Fayter not considering significant, The History of Science Fiction (2006): namely that Reformation cultural fascinations forged what we now call sf out of a broadly Protestant cultural logic, and that certain core thematics of the contemporary genre (a persistent interest in questions of atonement, for instance) can be explained by this point of origin. Kenneth Howell's God's Two Books: Copernican Cosmology and Biblical Interpretation in Early Modern Science (2002) explores the way sixteenth- and seventeenth-century astronomers and theologians, particularly in Protestant Northern Europe, attempted to reconcile the new sciences with religion. Steven Vanden Broecke's review essay "Astrological Reform, Calvinism, and Cartesianism: Copernican Astronomy in the Low Countries, 1550-1650" {Studies in the Philosophy and History of Science, 2004) explores this territory very persuasively. At this point I might dilate upon questions of what "materialism" means, if I had not already gone on at too great a length. It may be enough to note that I agree with Professor Fayter that materialism and "theism" (I'd be tempted to be more historically contextual and say "deism") need not be at odds with one another; this is not the same thing as saying that the Catholic Church was prepared to countenance either. Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston put it well in their co-edited third volume of The Cambridge History of Science: Early Modern Science (2006). They point out that recent research has stressed the disunity and diversity of cultural and scientific work at this time: "it is no longer clear that there was any coherent enterprise in the early modern period that can be identified with modern science." But they do not question that a revolution took place: nothing has yet challenged contemporaries' own view of their epoch as drenched in novelty. On the contrary, historical research across a broad range of topics has confirmed their impression of pell-mell change at every level.... It is of course no coincidence that so many remarkable changes, however disparate in substance, pace and outcome, occurred in the same time span of about two hundred years. (14) We have a shorthand phrase to describe this change: Copernican revolution. - Adam Roberts, Royal Holloway University, London</page></plain_text>
