<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS GOD CHANGING? A Christian Natural Theology based on the Thought of Alfred North Whitehead. By John B. Cobb, Jr. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, |6.50. Christians today are frequently ex horted to dispense with metaphysics, religion, and lately, even with God. One wonders if the theologians preach ing these exhortations are not re tarded "modernists," or the new "traditionalists." Being late in their reading, as usual, are they discovering Schleiermacher, Hegel, Feuerbach, Nietzsche, or even D. F. Strauss' Life of Jesus (1835) which is based on the antagonism between faith and knowl 116 edge, religious truth and logical truth? The 19th century was full of clever Christian theologies, without Chris tianity and without theology. Or are the radical theologians trying to dis cover the nakedness of the Word of God and the purity of faith, casting philosophies and religions into the outer darkness? Dr. Cobb, more realistically, is searching for the intelligence of faith rather than faith without intelligence; he believes "in the wedding of the vividness of religious experience and the rigor of critical reason." His schol arly study is devoted to one of the most debated steps of theological in CROSS CURRENTS: WINTER 19««</page><page sequence="2">quiry: natural theology, or philosophi- that biblical faith should swallow cal theism.
