<plain_text><page sequence="1">CREATED TRUTHS AND CAUSA SUI IN DESCARTES In a letter to Mersenne, as early as 1630, Descartes wrote that he intended to treat several metaphysical questions in his physics, - parti- cularly this one: that the mathematical truths which are called eternal have been established by God and depend entirely upon Him.1 He begs Mersenne not to keep it secret but to proclaim every where and upon every possible occasion that God has decreed these mathematical truths just as a king establishes the laws of his country. Here, in his subsequent letters to Mersenne, Mesland, Arnauld, and, in fact, throughout his writings where this doctrine of created truths is expounded, the major reason that Descartes offers for this thesis is that to entertain the opposite theory, to maintain the autonomy of truths and essences, is to blaspheme and violate the power of God; it is to speak of God as of a Jupiter or Saturn and to subject him to the Styx and to the Fates. On the contrary, everything must be subjected to the immense and incomprehensible power of God. If truths, like those of mathematics, are declared to be independent and untreated, it might suggest that even if God did not exist, they would. But the existence of God is the first and most truly eternal of all truths and the only one upon which the existence of all others depends.2 But may we not take "independent" in the mitigated sense? May we not assert ideas to exist in God's mind, but make a distinction between God's understanding of these truths and His will or power to create? To this Descartes gives a categorically negative answer. It is blasphemous to say that truths precede God's knowledge in any way, since in God it is a single thing to know and to will.3 Even if no temporal, but only a logical, distinction is made between the divine understanding and the divine will, this too would place a restriction on God's liberty and omnipotence. It is a self-contradiction, declares Descartes, to the protagonists of the Sixth Objections, to conceive that the will of God has not been utterly indifferent with respect to what has or may come to pass. Hence, too, it is a self-contradiction to suppose that there are any ideas of truth and goodness in the divine mind, logically prior to their ordination by God's will, for then He would have been impelled to choose one thing rather than 1 Oeuvres de Descarte8, Adam and Tannery, eds., Paris, France, 1897, ff.

On the contrary, God made the world in time, for example, and, therefore, simply because He hap- pened to make it in His way, it is better than if it had been produced from all eternity. And although God willed certain things to be neces- sary, it by no means can be asserted that He has been necessitated to will them.5 Consequently, affirms Descartes, no distinction must be allowed be- tween the divine acts, not even "in order, or in nature, or in reasoned re- lation." 6 It is one thing in God to will, to understand, and to create, without the one preceding the other, ne quidem ratione.7 Because there is no anteriority between the intelligence and the volition of God and therefore no priority of these truths to either the divine will or knowledge, writes Descartes to Mersenne, whether one conceives those truths as possible or as actual, one must affirm that they are such only because God knows them to be such and not that God knows them to be possible or actual because they are such.8 And again since in God, to know, to will, and to create are unqualifiedly the same, it makes no difference whether we say that God willed, made, disposed, or created the essences and truths.9 Later, in the Reply to Objections 11, Descartes declares in a passage pregnant with Spinozistic monism and modern self-positing idea- lism, that one may consider the whole universe as an "entity formed by the divine thought" 10 because knowing and producing are identical. To Mersenne, as later in the Reply to Objections VI, Descartes states that God produced these truths by exactly the same species of causality as He created all other things, namely as the efficient and total cause,11 4 Reply to Objections VI, The Philosophical works of Descartes, Haldane and Ross, trans., Cambridge, 1931, Vol. II, p. 248.

Their immutabil- ity is only conditional. And it is useless to ask how God could have brought it about that four times two not be eight, or how He could annul the nature of the triangle.14 The very fact that these truths are so clear and distinct and utterly comprehensible, whereas the power of God is wholly incomprehensible, shows that they must be inferior to and dependent upon that power.15 The fundamental obstacle, according to Descartes, that prevents the mind from acknowledging the dependency of these truths upon the divine omnipotence is that that power, although knowable, is utterly incompre- hensible, while these mathematical laws are so very clear and distinct that they appear to be intrinsically necessary and eternal. But, warns Descartes,16 while it is legitimate to conclude that God has been able to produce whatever we can comprehend, we must not judge anything to be impossible to His power, however, from the fact that it may be in- comprehensible to our finite mind. In fact incomprehensibility is em- braced in the formal concept of the infinite,17 for although we do have a clear and distinct idea of God, by that idea we so to speak touch God and know that He exists, but we do not embrace the divine essence.18 If these comprehensible truths and essences of things were not created 12 Reply to Objections VI, H.

The incomprehensibility of God makes us esteem him all the more, just as a king has greater majesty the less familiarly he is known to his subjects; provided, however, Descartes adds significantly, that they do not for all that think of being without a king, and that they know him sufficiently not to doubt of him.

"I announce" asserts Descartes categorically to Gassendi, "that it is a manifest contradiction that, when I comprehend anything, that thing should be infinite." 20 God, thus, is the author of essences or ideas, of mathematical truths, of axioms 21 such as that the whole is greater than the part, all of which are innate in the mind, as He is of the existences of the external world. But just as God has been free not to create the world, so has He been free to bring it about that the lines from the center to the circumference of a circle not be equal.22 Admittedly, this is difficult to understand; nevertheless, since it is indubitably clear that nothing which falls under the category of causation can exist independently of God, it is highly irrational to doubt concerning what we do understand because of what we do not understand.23 If then we attend to the immensity of God, Descartes holds, we shall be compelled to conclude that everything which subsists, every law, all order and every reason of truth and goodness de- pends upon the indifferent legislation of God. 24 The Cartesian thesis of created truths, with its premises of the absolute identity of the divine acts, the absence of any predetermined or fixed essences of goodness or truth, and the utterly willful, arbitrary, motiveless, indifferent and incomprehensible liberty characterizing divine omnipoten- ce, is thus a metaphysical position by which, as Gilson has shown, Des- cartes simultaneously achieves two important results for his physics. On the one hand, this conception of God banishes final causes from metaphysics, for to suppose that God acts for some end, however in- scrutable it may be, is to admit some forethought, some idea, or some plan prior to the creative act. But this possibility has been unmistakably 19 Consult Etienne Gilson, La liberty chez Descartes et la theologie, Paris, 1913, pp. 104-5 (abbreviated: Liberte); see reply to Burman, April 16, 1648, A.

Supreme indifference is the very mark of divine omnipotence. But how, asked the theologians, may we assert indifference as a perfection in God's will and a defect in human will, since the essences of things are indivisible? To this Descartes replied that the attributes of God and man are not univocal. Because man finds the nature of truth and goodness already determined for him what constitutes a perfection in God would be an impiety in man. Ibid., pp. 248-9.</page><page sequence="5">70 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ruled out by the emphatic denial of any distinction among the divine attributes. So confident was Descartes that final causes were absurd even in metaphysics that he considered it to be sheer anthropomorphism to conceive, for example, that God made the world for His own glory.25 In the second place, this doctrine of created essences and the in- comprehensible libertarianism of God allowed Descartes to assert that we must not judge that the material world is finite, that it has fixed boundaries, or that it contains atoms from the fact that infinite ex- pansionality or infinite divisibility is not clearly comprehended by us. Let us say, then, that the world is indefinite and that for all we know it is finite to God.26 Let us not dispute about the infinite and let us not cir- cumscribe the power of God. A great many things may have been created which are not intended for man's use. Man may not be the monarch of the universe. The earth may not be the center of the world. And because God's power is so incommensurate with human understanding, Descartes can resort to this very principle in his public utterances as a sufficient reason for turning men away from the pursuit of the ends of God to the establishment of a "perfect science" 27 which consists in a knowledge of effects through their causes.28 The question remains, however, whether, in this bold, ambitious de,- mand for absolute rigor and certainty, Descartes does not undermine the very goal that he sought. By making mathematics and physics the fruit of his own intellect - however divinely ordained - does he not reduce these sciences either to a fortuitous anthropologism or to the arbitrary status of mere fiction or of pragmatic convention? For if God is arbitrary creator of truth, then truth loses all objective significance. And 25 To the anonymous Hyperaspistes he writes: "ce serait toutefois une chose puerile et. absurde d'assurer en metaphyVique que Dieu, 'a la fagon d'un homme superbe, n'au- rait point eu d'autre fin, en batissant le monde, que cella d'etre loue par les hommes."

On the other hand, in his letter to Chanut, Descartes does not hesitate to employ the glory of God as a reason for disproving a finite universe made for man. A. T. V, pp. 53-4. 26 Principles, Pt. 1, Prin. 26, H. R. I, pp. 229-30. 27 Principles, Pt. 1, Prin. 24, H. R. I, p. 229. Cf. Reply to Objections V, H. R. II, p. 223. 28 Descartes' view of created truths and his banishment of final causes is intended, as Le Moine observes, to avert man's gaze from the supernatural to the natural and terrestial: "La vie future? ce n'est pas elle qui saurait nous interesser: occupons-nous de la vie present, tUchons de penetrer la nature et de nous en rendre maitres. Dieu peut tout? nous aussi, dans notre domaine, soyons tout-puissants; et, puisque le ciel demeure ferme 'a notre speculation, possedons la terre. (A. Le Moine, Des verities eternelles selon Malebranche, Paris, 1950, p. 188)." And this desire to become the master and possessor of nature (Descartes, Discourse, Pt. 6, H. R. I, p. 119) reflects, of course, Descartes' firm allegiance to Bacon (for example, NQoVm Orqacnum, Bk. 1, Aph. 129).</page><page sequence="6">CREATED TRUTHS AND CAUSA SUI IN DESCARTES 71 if the mind can develop or construct science from within itself, then it is theoretically possible that there can be as many different systems as there are minds. There is no longer any absolute, objective, public re- ference as immutable standard. Descartes was not unaware of this problem and of its gravity. Well did he realize that if an arbitrary, indifferent will is the source of truth, then he, Descartes, would have to find some way of curbing such power. Put differently, Descartes realized that he had to find some means of guaranteeing first, that what his mind apprehended as true was true and, second, that it would remain true permanently. Descartes had to guaran- tee not only the soundness of his intellect but also the continued exis- tence of its structure. He had to show not only that the mind could think truly but that it would always think in the same way or always possess the same innate ideas. Descartes could not possibly say that truth was permanent becauses God could not alter it, or that the essence of man was to be rational, and therefore capable of knowing the truth. He could not make such statements since his conception of God was one of unlimited power. This, coupled with the Cartesian doctrine of time as pulverized into disconnected instants, made it necessary to find some instrumentality that would preserve the mind with its essences or truths from instant to instant. Thus the validity of the light of nature and the stability of the ideas or natures known required that the power or efficient cause at their origin be veracious and also constant.29 29 Descartes, Principles, Pt. I, Prin, 30. Descartes, under criticism, claimed that the existence of God was necessary to guarantee, not our clear and distinct perceptions, but solely the memory of them. This was his reply to Arnauld and to the critics of the second set of objections who charged him with circular reasonings. Nevertheless, such state- ments as: I may be deceived each time that I add 3 and 2 together (Meditations, Med. 1, H. R. I, p. 174), make it difficult to accept Descartes' answer. Moreover, as Brehier points out (Histoire de la ph losophie, Paris, 1929, Vol. II, Fasc. 1, p. 81), and as Leibnitz did before him (On Descartes' Principles, "On Article 5," The philosophical works of Leibnitz, George M. Duncan, trans. and ed., second edition, New Haven, 1908, pp. 48-9 Cf. "On Article 13," p. 50), memory remains as fallible subsequent to the knowledge of a non-deceiving God as before. On the other hand, if Descartes did not seek to guarantee memory but really doubted in the immediate present what appears to be most evident, then, again as Leibnitz says, such a doubt would be absolutely insuperable and Descartes would be stymied at the very outset (ibid.). As a matter of fact, the problem of memory is really the problem of the continued existence of a truth formerly perceived. And in the presence of a propo- sition such as 4 + 3 = 7, while Descartes maintains that the mind cannot indeed doubt its truth, nevertheless he does also assert that: "It is requisite that we may be assured that all the things which we conceive clearly and distinctly are true in the very way in which we think them." (Meditations, Synopsis of the Meditations, H. R. I, p. 140). Of course even this interpretation still has its difficulties. Even if we assume that the issue of memory is fundamentally a problem concerning the future permanent existence of a truth now perceived, Descartes would again be impelled to limit the sphere of the doubt. If the continued subsistence of every evident proposition, such as, what has</page><page sequence="7">72 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH To Mersenne Descartes wrote that if anyone should ask whether God, like a king, could alter his decrees, the answer is no, because the divine will cannot change.30 Gilson maintains that in appealing to an immutable will Descartes is utilizing a scholastic principle without however providing any metaphysical justification for it.31 For the medieval, God can not deceive because His intelligence is restricted by fixed truth, because the been done cannot be undone, were doubted, Descartes would again be thwarted at the outset. Now, as a matter of fact, Descartes clearly claims in the Principles that "there is no doubt" that to those who are free from prejudices that class of propositions known as common notions or axioms are perfectly manifest. (Principles, Pt. 1, Prin. 50, H. R. I, p. 239.) Descartes distinguishes these axioms from our other cognitions in that they yield no knowledge of anything that may exist. (Ibid., Prin. 10, H. R. I, p. 222, and Prin. 49, pp. 238-9.) Because Descartes thus distinguishes between perceptions that have reference to possible existence and such general principles or "eternal truths" as ex nihilo nihil fit, Gueroult, Gilson and Levy-Bruhl maintain that the Cartesian doubt does not bear upon essences but only upon existential propositions. (See Gilson, Rene Descartes Discours de la me'thode, texte et commentaire, second edition, Paris, 1930, p. 287; M. Gueroult, "Le cogito et la notion 'pour penser, il faut etre,' " Travaux du IX6 Congres International (Congres Descartes), Paris, 1937, Vol. I, p. 57.) I cannot, however, accept the interpretation of these authors. Consider Gueroult's claim. He says that Descartes does not doubt the internal, ineluctable necessity of such notions as 3 + 2 = 5, or that the square has four sides, but that all that Descartes doubts is whether anything exists outside his thought comparable to these notions. Gueroult supports his claim by the fact that Descartes in the third Meditation asserts that ideas considered by themselves are not false, that falsity enters only into our judgments. Yet if we attend to Descartes' statements in the first Meditation, there can be no question that Descartes doubts the intrinsic necessity of 3 + 2 = 5 apart from any consideration of its objective external existence. There Descartes doubts the definition or essence of a square and not merely whether a square exists. But, one will ask, what about this third Meditation which says that when we consider ideas in themselves "and do not relate them to anything else beyond themselves," they cannot be false? And what about Descartes' statement to Clerselier: I have not rejected the simple ideas or notions which contain no affirmation or negation, but only the judgments in which alone there can be error or truth? (H. R. II. p. 127). Evidently there are two ways of relating ideas beyond themselves; there are two kinds of judgments that one can make about ideas. One kind of judgment, one way of relating an idea to something beyond itself, is to affirm that what is perceived in the present will hold for all time. Another kind of judgment or another way of relating an idea be- yond itself is to affirm that something exists conformable to the idea. Thus I would suggest that while Descartes does exempt some non-existential propositions such as "what has been done cannot be undone" from the sphere of doubt, he none the less does not exclude all of them. Such propositions which do not involve relatons among determinate representative ideas and which are indispensable for any discourse are free from doubt. On the other hand all such propositions as 3 + 2 = 5, or a square has 4 sides, which involve simple natures are subject to a doubt, that is, to their con- tinued existence. 30 April 15, 1630, A. T. I, p. 145-6. 31 Gilson, Liberte, pp. 51-56.</page><page sequence="8">CREATED TRUTHS AND CAUSA SUI IN DESCARTES 73 objects of the divine understanding are unalterable; and God can not vacillate in His volitions or creative acts, not merely because, being 'pure actuality' He is not subject to change, but also because His will and power are guided by a reason whose objects are permanent. Having espoused the doctrine of created truths and the unqualified identity of the divine attributes defined in terms of an arbitrary, indifferent power, to what can Descartes appeal to guarantee the immutability of that power with respect to its decrees? I believe that by the principle of Causa Sui Des- cartes did attempt to provide a justification, and that, indeed, under these circumstances, it is the only metaphysical tool by which he can even attempt to supply a justification. Causa Sui is the vehicle that Descartes uses to establish divine veracity, and thus the validity of the human light of nature, and divine immutability, and thus the stability of truth.32 To explain the existence of created ideas in the mind, Descartes, even though he denied final causes, could none the less have postulated a creative energy. But the conception of-sheer creativity without purpose would afford no guarantee of the veracity or constancy of the ideas which 32 My supposition that Descartes' doubt concerning mathematical truths stems from the possibility of an all-powerful deity creating and altering these ideas in the future, and my claim that Descartes introduces Causa Sui to combat this possibility were sug- gested to me by a reading of two texts. In his Histoire de la philosopher (Vol. II, Pt. 1, p. 69), Brehier declares that Descartes could hardly have imagined the evil demon had he not entertained the doctrine of created verities. Brehier, however, offers no expla- nation of this correlation. On the other hand, Gilson in his Etudes (Etudes sur le role de la pensee mrdieivale dans la formation du sysdeme cartes8ien, Paris, 1930) asserts: "L'evi- dence peut se suffire et se suffit, mais elle ne garantit pas l'infaillibilite de la memoire; elle ne garantit meme pas la permanence de sa propre v6rit6 dans l'intervalle de deux intuitions. Pour que ce qui est vrai, reste vrai, il faut done une garantie distincte de l'evidence meme, un principe stable de certitude . . . " (p. 237). But as long as we ab- stain, as Gilson does in this text, from considering Descartes' doctrine of created truths, it is by no means self-evident that a principle is required to guarantee the permanence of a truth once perceived and remembered. Once we do correlate created truths with the demon, however, then not only does it become clear that some principle is required to guarantee the future status of ideas, but also that Causa Sui is the only possible prin- ciple. Descartes' doctrine of Causa Sui is ordinarily treated as being exclusively a me- taphysical innovation. His attempt to drive the axiom of efficient causality to its last limits is sometimes interpreted as being the only effective means by which Descartes could reach an existence other than that of his own mind and at the same time do so through the traditional principle of efficient causality. Such is Gilson's interpretation for example. Sometimes in this principle of Causa Sui one finds the influence of Des- cartes' mathematical training. No one so far as I know has given it an interpretation in relation to the epistemology of Descartes. Yet when we consider that his metaphysics and mathematics are primarily oriented to his physics and all-three are concerned with certainty, my epistemological approach to the doctrine of Causa Sui seems more than justified.</page><page sequence="9">74 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH it might create. Such a creativity could be purely volatile and capricious, and if so, defective and irrational beyond even the point of creative indifference. Descartes' hyperbole of the evil demon is precisely of such an unprincipled, wayward, and fickle creative energy, that can alter the truth even in the very instant in which the mind seeks to grasp it.33 Now the only means to avoid the charge of actually having this demon, who is potent enough to be indifferent with respect to what he pronounces to be good and true, but not sufficiently powerful to possess the perfections of veracity and immutability, is to conceive a far more immense power, which cannot fail to own every conceivable perfection or aspect of reality. Measured against such a conception of towering perfection, mere creativity is not simply unprincipled; it is defective in potency. As a creator it is even evil, for it may not restrain itself from deceiving us on some or all occasions, and its creative potency is subject to a continual ebb and flow. The evil demon as an arbitrary power is evil precisely in so far as he may change essences and thus in so far as he may make and unmake his decisions. The evil demon does not necessarily have to change or deceive, but the fact that he may is for Descartes a sign that he is not really all powerful; it indicates a lack in self-restraint or a lack of stability or a lack of knowledge. A power stronger than that of the demon would be sufficiently potent 'to guarantee that what seemed to be true is true and would remain true. Descartes' problem then is to guarantee certainty in the sciences by a Deity more perfect than a mere creative force, without sacrificing His indifference. Having denied final causes, he had only power or efficient causality remaining by which to constitute this Deity. Descartes attempted to achieve greater perfection than that of a mere generative impetus by the device of doubling that power back on itself. Descartes believed that any being so potent as to be the efficient or formal cause of its own existence was capable of endowing itself with every other perfection, for no perfection seemed to Descartes so great as that of existence.34 Descartes had only power to which to appeal to explain perfection, but he believed that self-creation was power without limit. A Causa Sui was all that Descartes could appeal to in order to satisfy his scientist's demand for certainty, but a Causa Sui must have appeared to Descartes as quite sufficient to satisfy this demand. How? Just as a mere cause or power, like the demon, will not of itself be equivalent to a veracious and immutable God, neither will an uncaused power. Such an uncaused power may expend itself and cease to be; 33 Cf. Br6hier, Histoire de la Philosophie, Vol. II, Pt. 1, p. 69. 34 E.g., Descartes, Reply to Objections IV, H. R. II, p. 111.</page><page sequence="10">CREATED TRUTHS AND CAUSA SUI IN DESCARTES 75 it may be of a limited nature, unable to preserve its effects. Hence, writes Descartes to Caterus and to Arnauld, unless we pursue the prin- ciple of causality to its very limit, unless we seek the cause of everything that may exist, including God, we shall never arrive at a First Cause at all. On the other hand, considering the immense, incomprehensible power which exists in the idea of Him, we at once recognize that this power, by being its own source, requires no assistance to exist or to continue to exist.35 Now, one of the most common statements in Descartes, present in his early as well as in his late works, is that any being capable of giving himself existence and of preserving that existence possesses in this capa- city a perfection so great that it includes every other perfection.36 To Descartes it is axiomatic ("the light of nature makes it very clear") that if he were able to create himself he would give himself infinity, that is, infinite understanding, immutability, and omnipotence. Truth for Des- cartes falls under the category of being; error is non-being.37 For God to err or to deceive is, to use a Cartesian expression, to tend toward non-being or nothingness.38 Accordingly, the capacity to deceive, declares Descartes, is by no means a mark of subtlety or power but rather a sign of feebleness and impotence.39 But a God who gives and maintains His own existence cannot tend towards non-being. Hence He is veracious. This means that when the mind beholds the idea of a triangle, it is indeed beholding a real thing or a truth, not nothing. In the second place, such a power that gives itself every predicate of being is self-sufficient. Nothing is lacking to its nature. As it has caused and maintained its existence from all eternity, so from all eternity has it possessed all of being. From all eternity it has been full, complete, perfect.

As He is constant and immu- table in Himself by virtue of being His own cause, so will that causal operation be uniform in whatever it may determine to create.41 Nevertheless, granted that God's nature is immutable, how does this serve to prove that His laws or essences are also immutable? May He not have decreed from all eternity, and without any change in Himself, the perpetual permutation of essences? It is indisputable that He could, since He could even have made contradictories to exist together. However, Causa Sui has guaranteed divine veracity. Now, when we perceive that the angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, we perceive it as an immutable nature or essence. Consequently it must forever be so. The only condition upon which that truth can cease is for God's will or power to change. But this is impossible. And thus Descartes is able to write to Mersenne: "On vous dira que si Dieu avait etabli ces verites, il les pourrait changer commeb un Roi fait ses lois; a quoi il faut repondre que oui, si sa volonte peut changer." 42 Thenceforth, Descartes can be sure that his understanding is not a perverted 43 faculty so that whatever he perceives clearly and distinctly in science is indubitable, with a certainty that is more than pragmatic. It is absolute.44 Unfortunately, Causa Sui as developed by Descartes is an unhappy solution to the problem of guaranteeing the stability and objectivity of truth. For Causa Sui, though couched in terms of power, is really not the traditional view of God. It reduces God to an abstract essence that posits existence or entails it as a logical property. How does Descartes' God establish and secure His existence? Through the immensity of His power. This is true; however, for Descartes the divine attributes are absolutely identical and indistinguishable. Not even a distinction of reason is allow- 40 Cf, for example, Descartes, Passions, Pt. 1, Art. 48, and Pt. 3, Art. 170, H. R. I, pp. 354 and 409. Discourse, Pt. 3, second maxim, H. R. I, p. 96. 41 Descartes, Principles, Pt. 2, Prin. 36 applies to essences; it does not apply to existences. God is potent in guaranteeing the immutability of truth, but the constant changes in created objects not only implies no variation in His power, but confirms it (Ibid., Prin. 42). 42 April 15, 1630, A.

Hence the immensity of God's power is not only equivalent to but the same as the intellect. This is why Descartes writes that God is the efficient cause of Himself and yet that in this very efficiency He is also a formal cause.45 Thus God is an essence that involves or confers existence as a property. It is the eternity and permanency and immutability of the essence that guarantees the permanence of God's existence. Therefore, it is really as an immutable intellectual essence that God preserves the immutable character of all other essences that issue from His creative thought. With such a view of God, it makes no sense to speak of an indifferent creation or free will or veracity. This Spinoza saw with great clarity. Hence Spinoza not only followed Descartes and renounced finalism, but also went far beyond Descartes to discard the entire traditional framework of cre- ation, of independent existence, and of free will. Descartes, on the contrary, was not prepared to reach Spinoza's conclusions. Descartes wanted a God who would be at once a self-sustaining essence and an indifferent creative will. As an essence, He would guarantee the stability of the will. But as an indifferent will, what God would really be guaranteeing would be the au- tonomy and self-certifying creative power of Descartes' own finite conscious- ness. Descartes' God is an intellectual power, but one unrestricted in how it thinks or in what it thinks. Hence He is indifferent, a thought that blindly postulates or decrees truths. The truths do not emanate by any necessity from God's intellectual efficacy. He is not constrained to think that three plus two are five. He merely happens to think that way. Now man is made in the image of God. By his own intellectual powers he too is capable of freely constructing a metaphysics or physics or analytical geometry such that, once made, it is self justifying by its own internal coherence and consistency. Just as God is not compelled to determine the truth by fixed essences independent of His thought, just as God need not look to anything beyond Himself as a reference to which His thinking must be adequate, so the mind need not seek for any signs external to itself to guarantee its own thought processes. He who has a true idea, says Spinoza, knows it, nor can he doubt the truth of it. A true idea agrees with its ideatum, but the mind is a spiritual automaton that requires no more than its own inner light to know when it adequately mirrors reality. Thus speaks Spinoza, and this is what Descartes sought with the doctrine of created truths, but with this difference: for Spinoza, the mind, after all, mirrors reality. For Descartes, reality and God must conform to and mirror his own inventive mind. Indeed, Descartes' doctrine of created truths needs 45 Descartes, Reply to Objectionw IV, H. R.

THE RAND CORPORATION. 46 Perhaps another reason that impels Descartes to Causa Sui is this. His method is to proceed not from the unknown to the known, but from the known to the unknown. A perfect science is to go from an efficient cause that is known to a deduction of its effects. If God is conceived in negative terms as uncaused, it is like proceeding from nothing to something. But per se in the positive sense implies starting from the known. Consequently Descartes asserts that just as the notion of the impossibility of an in- finite regress is merely a negative doctrine revealing the limits of the mind, so self- originated in its negative meaning "proceeds merely from the imperfection of the human intellect."
