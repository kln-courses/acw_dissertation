<plain_text><page sequence="1">Angela Dalie-Vacche Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style Although some paths have been opened by literature and the occupation, the phenomenon [neorealismi cannot be explained on this level alone. . . . The body of référencés I have adopted has excluded similarities even less disputable, for example, the Italian "tale," the commedia dell'arte and the technique of the fresco. ( Bazin 40, emphasis mine) Let us entertain the idea that the casting of non-professional actors in neorealist cinema opens up a new way of thinking about the représentation of history and national life. Reflecting on the non-professional actors cast by Rossellini in Paisà (1946) for the episode set in the Po Valley, Gian Piero Brunetta writes: La storia passa sul corpo di questi personaggi e ancora oggi . . . siamo colpiti da questa perfetta congruenza di tutti gli elementi e dalla percezione di un mutamento profondo in un paesaggio e in un corpo sociale in apparenza immobile. ... il cinema italiano si scrolla di dosso, con un solo colpo, tutta la tradizione letteraria e teatrale e riportando il personaggio popolare al centro della scena sconvolge un sistema di rappresentazione statico raccontando l'irruzione nel mondo contadino di una nuova storia. . . . ("Il cinema come storia" 50) (History passes over the body of these characters and even today ... we are struck by the perfect congruence of ali elements and by the perception of a profound change in an apparently immobile landscape and body politic. . . . with one blow, Italian cinema shakes off a whole literary and theatrical tradition and, bringing populär characters back to center-stage, it upsets a static system of représentation thus narrating the breakthrough of a new history in the Venetian peasant world . . . .) (Emphasis mine; hereafter ali translations are my own.) How useful are Brunetta's insights on the historicity of the body and on the challenge put forth by the bodily to traditional history? Do these insights lead to a better understanding of the dialogue between French history and Italian cinema that is staged through the body in Ettore Scola's Ballando ballando {Le Bai 1983)? These are the questions that this essay seeks to situate in the context of Italian and French film history.</page><page sequence="2">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 99 1. From the commedia dell'arte to Late Neorealism: A History of National Life In light of Brunetta's remarks above, one could argue that neorealist cinema consists of a move away ffom the literary towards the bodily. Working with non-professional actors becomes much more important than carefully revising the cinematic treatment of a novel or the détails of a traditional script.1 This emphasis on the physical over the verbal is a reaction against an anaemic Italian literary scene. It is also a reaction against the films of the regime, whose actors Visconti has compared to "corpses." In an attack against tiresome productions based on high cultural sources such as Gallone's Scipione l'Africano (1937), Visconti hypothesizes the birth of an "anthropomorphic" cinema: Among ali my activities in the cinema, my favorite is working with actors; with the human material from which we build those living men who give birth to a new reality, the reality of art. The actor is above ali a man possessing key human qualities. . . . My experience has taught me that the heft of a human being, his presence, is the only thing which really fills the frame; that he creates the atmosphère with his living presence. (Overbey 84)2 In 1934, while writing on actors, Visconti shoots Ossessione, a frank portrayal of adultery and provincial squalor, based on James Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice. Italian film culture of that time is saturated with the literary proprieties of the calligraphie genre3 and the redundant echoes of D'Annunzio's imitators. Arriving on this exsanguine domestic scene, American literature revitalizes Italian writers and filmmakers like a powerful blood transfusion. The language of Dos Passos, Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson and Sinclair Lewis speaks to Pavese and Vittorini, to Rossellini and Visconti, because it is less literary and flowery, and closer to daily speech and lived experience.4 In the attempt to explain the shift called for by Visconti, from an anaemic to an "anthropomorphic" cinema, from the literary to the bodily, great criticai 1 On the status of literary and traditional scripts in neorealist cinema, Cesare Zavattini, De Sica's screenwriter, argues: "The term neo-realism, in its larger sense, implies the élimination of technical-professional collaboration, including that of the screen writer. Manuals, grammar, syntax no longer have any meaning. ... In neo-realism, the screen writer and the writer of dialogue disappear; there will be no scenario written beforehand, and no dialogue to adapt" (Overbey 76). Mira Liehm reports Visconti's Clarion cali which first appeared in Cinema (10 giugno, 1941): "But the day will come of which we dream. Then the young forces in our film will be allowed to state clearly and loudly: 'The corpses to the cemetery!'" ( 52). 3 On the calligraphie genre, whose major représentatives are Mario Soldati, Luigi Chiarini, and Alberto Lattuada, see Brunetta, Storia del Cinema Italiano 1895-1945, 427-39. ^ On the impact of American slang on Italian writers see Wilkinson.</page><page sequence="3">100 Angela Dalle-Vacche scrutiny has been devoted to the impact of foreign influences on Italian cinema such as American literature, the British documentary school, French poetic realism, and socio-realist Soviet films. In the late thirties ali these elements converge on the future protagonists of the neorealist season.5 Scarce attention, however, has been granted to the role played in the development of the neorealist style by a national anti-literary tradition dating back to the commedia dell'arte. Does the privileging of foreign sources, a phenomenon that is stili so prominent in current work on the origins of neorealism, stem from the desire of postwar historians to de-nationalize and to de-provincialize the history of Itahan cinema in reaction to decades of Fascist autarchy? We know that Mussolini's censorship did not entirely succeed in sealing Italy off from the rest of the world. Yet it is also true that, since its early days, Italian cinema has depended on national cultural traditions for its stylistic and generic development (Brunetta, "La migrazione" 83-90). I would like to suggest that, just as opera is the term of reference for the silent and Fascist periods, so too the commedia dell'arte is one of the salient sources of neorealism and post-neorealism. Anticipating by four centuries the neorealist dictum of casting non professionals, the actors of the commedia are effective on stage more by virtue of their physical appearance and stereotypical behavior than by their skills as professional interpreters of a literary text. These mountebanks look right and know how to use their bodies in an expressive fashion. They do not work with an ironclad script rich in literary nuances. In the commedia the latter becomes a mere canovaccio: a brief, rough plot outline, with plenty of room for improvisation and pantomime, acrobaties and slapstick. Critics have traditionally downplayed the links between the commedia dell'arte and neorealist cinema in favor of an horizon of international literary and cinematic influences. I would attribute this to an oversight of the représentation of the body in Italian culture.6 More specifically, this heretofore unexamined relationship points to a lack of awareness of the ideological function of the body in Italian cinema where it serves as a mirrar image of the national self. Were we to connect neorealist casting and the masks of the commedia, we could more easily relate Fellini's construction of character7 to Pasolini's toothless faces. We could relate Pasolini's class-connoting bodies to the exploitation of national types in the star system of the New Italian Comedy. Linking neorealism to the commedia dell'arte yields more than just a better understanding of a network of stylistic influences. This tum of the cinema away from monumentai, operatic epics and the literary towards a less grandiose scale ^ On the sources of neorealism see Marcus, "Introduction," and Venturini. ® In 1981 the University of Aix-en-Provence sponsored a colloquium devoted to the représentation of the body in Italian literature. For some interesting studies on this topic, see Melchiorre and Cascetta. 7 On the influence of the commedia dell'arte on Fellini's style, see Marcus 144-63.</page><page sequence="4">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 101 and the bodily does breathe a breath of fresh air into Visconti's world of "corpses." Yet the revolutionary charge of this new orientation lasts little longer than the span of a single breath. I suspect this is so because, although this new approach is better suited to the représentation of the minutiae of daily life among average Italians, this change of scale, from monumental sets to more contained environments, lends itself to cooptability by Italian cinema as easily as does the operatic tendency which preceded iL I use the word "cooptable" because, for me, Italian cinema is a social technology8 presiding over the production of national stereotypes, mirrar images of différent manifestations of the national self. And I see this cooptability as relevant to the construction of character produced in Rossellini's and De Sica's neorealism. In contrast to the Marxist Visconti who depicts the effects of the class struggle, Rossellini and De Sica stress the need for civic coopération among différent classes or show the disastrous effects of social disharmony. Most film historians associate the spectacular-allegorical style of Italian cinema with opera without acknowledging that spectacle and allegory belong equally to the stage of the commedia. In my view, the connection with opera is an appropriate but limited one. It only illuminâtes how, in representing the past, Italian cinema follows the tracks of a dominant historiography of Rankean descent: a history made of great men, crucial battles, and mémorable events. I would argue instead that, in appropriating the scale of the commedia dell'arte, Italian cinema explores another representational formula. I would like, therefore, to give an additional meaning to the adjective "comedic" to indicate that commedia dell'arte is a term of cultural référencé which competes with opera in providing Italian cinema with a scale for the représentation of national life. Throughout this essay, therefore, the phrase "comedic scale" signifies this representational formula, an alternative which stands in contrast to the "operatic." This comedic scale historicizes not only the res gestae of the rich and famous, but can also turn its attention to the interface of body and history, of subjective experience and public events, as well as to the impact of public history on individuai behavior. As soon as the uneventful lives and the idiosyncratic manners of these typical Italians are represented on the screen, their faces and bodies, just like the masks and the costumes of the commedia, become emblems of an imaginary nation called "Italy." Thus, "Italy" becomes the ultimate referent of a national cinema, one cultural function of which I can now summarize: the construction of an all-encompassing, but multifaceted, historical identity grafted onto stereotypes of différence: class, regional, and sexual. I see the coexistence of these two scales—one based on opera, the other on 8 De Lauretis explains: "The fact that films, as the saying goes, speak to each and ali, that they address spectators both individually and as members of a social group, a given culture, age, or country [emphasis mine], implies that certain pattems or possibilités of identification for each and for all spectators must be built into the film" (136).</page><page sequence="5">102 Angela Dalie-Vacche the commedia dell'arte—as echoing the opposition between written and orai historiés, between mythology and the documentary, between textbook History written by institutions and the non-histories of marginai areas of society. Until recently these latter narratives have survived mostly in the realm of populär memory and regional folklore. They are now a fashionable subject of study in Italian and French academia. The increased popularity of the "new" history is due in part to the work of Carlo Ginzburg and Michel Foucault, who have researched peripheral historiés and have unearthed "suppressed knowledges."9 Whether or not the deployment of these two scales for representing national life dates back to the silent period—a period in which some film historians like to locate the origins of neorealism10—the direction of non-professional actors and casting based on physical appearance both highlight a shift away from a dominant mode of historical représentation toward an alternative way of historicizing the Italian identity. It is possible that my metaphor of neorealism as a shift of gears may seem too reductive to those film historians who place great significance on the ethical tension emanating from this period of Italian cinema. Nevertheless, I would argue that the fervor of intent and the social impegno that marked the neorealist generation, appear, retrospectively, as Symptoms tied to an historical momentum rather than to a well-thought-out politicai program of social reform. At the risk of making myself unpopulär, I would like to propose that there exists a strong element of expérimentation but it is also improvisation that animâtes the neorealist season. I am here purposefully borrowing the term "improvisation" from the vocabulary of the commedia. Both these features—expérimentation and improvisation—might help us to explain how it is that neorealism continues to affect international filmmaking today, even though its own moment in the sun was so very brief. Neorealism constitutes one of those cinematic phenomena which elude définition in a single sentence. At the heart of neorealism lies an irresoluble contradiction between continuity with and rupture from the past. To better analyze Ettore Scola's interprétation of the neorealist legacy and the history of its reception in French film culture, I would like to clarify my understanding of the neorealist contradiction: on the one hand, neorealist cinema continues to operate within an ideology of national culture. It produces an interclassist positioning for viewing subjects whose class, regional, and gender affiliations are explored but eventually assimilated into an overall national identity. According to this first description, neorealism does not seem to break radically away from Fascist cinema. Before and after World War II, Italian cinema 9 On the application of Foucault to film history, see Bruno. ^ The critic Umberto Barbaro argues that the roots of neorealism are to be found in the Neapolitan silent school that produced Nino Martoglio's Sperduti nel buio (1914; see Liehm 13). On the use of non-professional actors in the silent period, see Camerini.</page><page sequence="6">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 103 continues to operate as a social technology. The notion that the individuai is predicated on the national persists ali the same, but it is retailored to fit a new historical junction: the aftermath of the Resistance. On the other hand, the novelty of neorealism lies in its ability to question an overly clear-cut équation—inherited from the operatic practice of Fascist cinema—an équation which confiâtes the individuai with the national, the daily with the historical. As naive as Zavattini's emphasis on immediacy and unobtrusiveness may sound today, if reread against the background of silent and Fascist historical films, these Claims call attention to what I consider the most originai aspects of the neorealist project: to shoot in the présent tense in order to explore the impact of history on daily life; to rely on an episodio narrative in order to historicize the role played by chance encounters; to use the bodies of non-professional actors in order to show that the flow of public history and the rhythm of private behavior are neither neatly joined nor totally unrelated but, most of the time, at odds while their effects overlap and intersect with each other. The neorealist contradiction can now be quickly summarized: neorealism relies on a comedic scale to disengage itself from a previous representational formula of operatic scale. In this way, it produces an alternative way of historicizing the national identity. Although this microhistory of daily life, this comedic scale, counteracts an operatic tradition, it does not necessarily undermine the ideology of a national cinema, presiding over the construction of spectators as national subjects despite différences of class, région and gender. While the formulation "comedic scale" describes a general tendency, I would also argue that it might be possible to read specific films, or to discuss specific directors as developing a radical, non-cooptable critique of the national identity. These films and these directors would then be exploiting a comedic scale for a carnivalesque project.11 From the Roman epics of the thirties to the late neorealist bozzetti of the fifties, the quick hand of the social caricaturist takes over the cosmetic stylings of Fascist kitsch. The key terms of the encounter between cinema and history are no longer populär icons drawn from high culture or public history, or vulgarized references to indisputable historical evidence. In this new kind of microhistory for the screen, the bodies of the performers themselves become the équivalents of non-documents. The physical features of the actors' bodies, their movements, and their behavior ali point to an historical referent, convey a regional identity, reinforce sexual stereotypes, and speak of class affiliations. In doing so, these "non-documents" coexist next to or even replace the written HBennett discusses Bakhtin's use of the term "camivalesque" in regard to Rabelais's use of bodily imagery and argues that the latter serves "as a means of inverting the officiai social, moral and politicai order" (84). While the camivalesque might be useful in relation to Fellini's or Wertmuller's grotesque bodies, I think this term would be too strong to describe De Sica's constraction of characters in Umberto D.</page><page sequence="7">104 Angela Dalie-Vacche records of officiai institutions. These bodily non-documents tell a history that has been considered unworthy of Literature, a history that has been considered more appropriate for filmmaking, for photo-romans, and for comic strips. These non-documents document what two major founders of the "new" history, Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel, call the "long duration"12 of deeply ingrained national attitudes. The concept of "long duration" is helpful within an Italian context for understanding the distrust felt by marginai elements of society towards institutions; the petty corruption lurking underneath the narrow boundaries of provincial life; the machismo of the heroes of the New Italian Comedy, and the criminal ingenuity of Wertmuller's oppressore and oppressed.13 This connection between the "new" history and the Italian cinema can be seen in a filmic text which I would like to consider in some detail. In Ettore Scola's Ballando ballando, an operatic macrohistory and a comedic microhistory constantly cross paths in the ballroom of French history. At times allegorical embodiments from either camp may dance together, at times they may drift apart. Scola's Ballando ballando, I hope to demonstrate, represents the intersection of several lines of inquiry: 1) the représentation of the past in recent Italian films; 2) the history of France before and after World War II; 3) the history of the influence of Italian neorealism on the French Nouvelle vague", 4) the formulation of a new way of conceiving the historical process that originates among historians of the Ecole des annales. And, finally as I shall argue, Ballando ballando sheds light on the historicization of national life in Italian cinema. Thus, Ballando ballando serves as a useful (pre)text to mobilize and to play off against each other ali the lines of inquiry outlined above through a series of interfaces. We are now prepared to trace the stylistic history and the theoretical significance of a certain tendency toward the bodily, travelling first from Italy to France, and then returning from France to Italy. 2. French Insights on Postwar and Recent Italian Cinema In contrast to this neglect of the commedia in Italian neorealist historiography, the French critic Jean Gili, following Bazin's insight, has already begun to trace the influence of this populär theatrical form in the context of the New Italian comedy.14 In this last genre, which flourishes in the 11 See the chapter devoted to the Ecole des annales in Iggers (43-79). |1 On the commedia dell'arte in Wertmuller's films, see Magretta and Magretta (25-43). ^ Discussing the relation between the New Italian Comedy and the commedia dell'arte, Jean Gili cites Mario Monicelli: "L'unione di buffoneria e disperazione—dichiara Monicelli— appartiene veramente alla tradizione italiana, è qualcosa che viene dalla commedia dell'arte. Gli eroi della commedia dell'arte sono sempre dei disperati, dei poveri diavoli che combattono con la vita, con il mondo, la fame, la miseria, la malattia, la violenza" (181; "This mixture of clownishness and desperation ruly belongs to the Italian tradition, it is something which</page><page sequence="8">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 105 seventies, the faces and postures of Alberto Sordi, Nino Manfredi, Vittorio Gassman, and Ugo Tognazzi exemplify national vices and virtues much as the somatic features of Arlecchino, Colombina, and Pulcinella are eternally impregnated with a moral and social commentary that transcends their immediate associations with stereotypes of class, région, and gender. How significant is it that remarks on the relationship between the commedia dell'arte and Italian cinema appear in the work of a French film historian? From André Bazin and the circle of young critics at Cahiers du cinéma to Jean Gili, evidence of this French connection continues to accumulate. This leads me to rephrase the question: why is French film culture sensitive to the way in which neorealist and recent Italian cinema utilize the actor's body on the screen, at the expense of other aspects, such as dialogue and narrative development? In the late forties, André Bazin and the Cahiers du cinéma circle become the first critics to acknowledge Rossellini's achievement in Roma città aperta (1945) and in Paisà (Bazin 16-40). By contrast, most Italian critics find these two films "choppy" and "hard to follow" (Brunetta, Storia del cinema dal 1945 113). In the mid fifties Bazin again défends Fellini's right to allegorize a private rather than a public self in La Strada (1954; Bazin 83-92; 93-101). The Italian Left headed by Guido Aristarco rallies instead against Fellini, lamenting his betrayal of the neorealist commitment to social change (Aristarco 312). The heavily politicized debate surrounding the juxtaposition of Visconti's criticai realism in Senso (1954) and Fellini's phenomenological interest in the life of the inner self marks a struggle to reassess the extent to which the personal dépends on the politicai, the individuai on the national. The impact of Italian neorealism on French critics and filmmakers becomes ali the more evident through an analysis of the stylistic innovations introduced by les enfants terribles of the early Nouvelle vague. Their war against the literary adaptations of Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost for a "Cinema of Quality" is inspired by Rossellini's direction of actors, De Sica's use of real time, and Zavattini's rejection of an Aristotelian plot. From the 1940s to the 1950s, neorealism offers to Italian and French cinema a Standpoint from which to challenge the dominant formula of high budget productions associated with the Fascist epics and "Tradition of Quality." A major feature of this French-Italian connection that I plan to unearth, example after example, is its rejection of a literary script in favor of gestures, facial expressions, and behavior as a way to construct characters, to explore an existential dimension, and to tell a story. This rediscovery of the signifying power of the body on the screen leads to a downplaying of literary sources. Bazin's and Gili's observations, as well as the influence exercised on Godard cornes from the commedia dell'arte. The heroes of the commedia dell'arte are always desperate, poor devils, who fight with life, the world, hunger, poverty, illness, violence"). Also, on the relation between the commedia dell'arte and film style, see Green and Swan.</page><page sequence="9">106 Angela Dalle-Vacche and Bresson by neorealist casting and direction of actors, demonstrate that the commedia dell'arte is a hidden dimension intertwined with the history of both Italian cinema and the Nouvelle vague, rather than a representational formula whose influence is limited to the comédie genre only. Furthermore, this body of evidence clearly indicates why French film culture so promptly appréciâtes the work of Ettore Scola, a major représentative of this comedic legacy. Indeed, Scola's Ballando ballando brilliantly exemplifies the use of the commedia dell'arte, in conjunction with an operatic scope, to endow with an emblematic edge the behavior of anonymous individuals whose Uves unfold in the shadow of prominent historical figures and events. In this film, a troupe of dancers articulâtes différent aspects of the body politic of the French nation. They recount fifty years of French history, from the Populär Front to today, using dance, music, and lighting but no spoken dialogue. As a non-verbal film, Ballando ballando is an anachronism which defies the course of international film history since the advent of sound in the late twenties. This unorthodox film, in which movements and glances replace words, is not Scola's first successful attempt to work within a French-Italian cultural milieu. Other of his recent films have been marketed to international audiences under French titles: Une Journée particulière (1977), for example, and La Nuit des Varennes (1981), as if Scola were a French, instead of an Italian, director. Scola emigrates offîcially to France shortly after C'eravamo tanto amati (1974),15 a film that reviews the changes and disillusionments in post-WWII Italian society and the eclipse of the neorealist cinema of Rossellini, Zavattini, and De Sica.16 Dating Scola's émigration to France with a reference to C eravamo tanto amati may not be entirely accurate. Nevertheless, it is a convenient mark in time that stresses the vitality of Scola's relationship with Italian neorealism. The tone of this film, oscillating as it does between nostalgia and disillusionment, hints at Scola's difficulty in carrying out the neorealist project begun in the forties in the context of today's Italian film industry, where either old auteurs dominate or cheaply made box-office successes proliferate. Scola's expatriation may also be due to the fact that his work, just as Roma città aperta. Paisà and Umberto D thirty years ago, is acclaimed more promptly in France Scola's previous box-office success in France was Dramma della gelosia, tutti i particolari in cronaca (1970) (Drame de la jalousie). Scola's career reveals an intriguing conjunction of influences and interests: neorealism, comedy, history and caricatures. Furthermore, he drew for Marc'Aurelio, a satirical magazine with which Fellini also collaborated. Before tuming to the historical film, Scola contributed to the comedic vein born out of neorealism. See for example, Riusciranno i nostri eroi a ritrovare l'amico misteriosamente scomparso in Africa (1968; Will Our Heroes Succeed in Locating Their Friend Mysteriously Disappeared in Africa?) and Brutti sporchi e cattivi (1976; Dirly, Mean and Nasty). On Scola's drawings, see De Santi. 1® Both Scola's C'eravamo tanti amati (We All Loved Each Other So Much) and La Nuit des Varennes deal with the aftermath of a revolutionary phase and its incorporation into private life, individuai behavior.</page><page sequence="10">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 107 than in Italy. Although most recent Italian directors, such as Cavani, Bertolucci, the Tavianis, and Olmi, rely on RAI, the national television network, to sponsor their films—Francesco D'Assisi (1966), La strategia del ragno (The Spider's Stratagem 1970), Padre Padrone (1976-77) and L'albero degli zoccoli (The Tree of the Wooden Clogs 1978)—Scola has weathered the crisis of recent years thanks to French and international audiences.17 Such a sympathetic response is nothing new for French film culture, always alert and vibrating with initiatives in favor of Italian cinema Cases in point are the rétrospective held at the Centre Georges Pompidou,18 and two annual festivals at Annecy and Nice devoted to recent Italian films.19 The success of Ballando ballando in France may also be due to the way in which this film exemplifies, in Truffaut's words, "a certain tendency" 20 of Italian cinema, a cinema which survives the end of neorealism, with the Andreotti Studio Law (1949), by emigrating to France. After inspiring Nouvelle vague filmmakers in the 1950s and 60s, this tendency towards the bodily reappears with new energy in the Italian cinema of the 1970s and 80s. In the post-neorealist cinema of Scola, Olmi, the Taviani brothers, and Rosi, a fascination with great spectacles coexists with close observations of daily life and behaviour. Scola's early comedies and recent historical films are rich in neorealist influences with regard to casting and direction of actors, and their spectacular-allegorical mise-en-scène stands comparison with the huge frescoes of the silent period, with the stagy dreams of Fellini, and with Bertolucci's psycho-political melodramas. Neorealist préoccupations with an overall national identity lose their vigor by the time they reach France. In this new cultural context, the Cahiers circle disregards the address to an Italian national subject in favor of more neutral stylistic features, such as shooting on location in the countryside or in the streets of Paris. The films of these young directors are much more tied to a specific région or city than to the French nation as a whole. Weary of the provincialism that always looms over the history of Italian cinema (neorealism included), the Nouvelle vague flourishes within the international horizon of world film history, in contrast to the narrow, domestic focus of high-budget screen adaptations of the great masterpieces of French literature. The Cahiers directors reject the work of their immediate fathers (Clouzot, Autant-Lara, Cayatte, Allegret and Delannoy), whose authority they replace with a restricted pantheon of foreign role-models. Their films often include reverent quotations of 17 In order to contextualize Scola's popularity with French audiences, see Ellero. 1 8 See the volume published in conjunction with the rétrospective edited by Bernardini and Gili. ^ Recent Italian films are regularly screened at the "Rencontres avec le cinéma méditerranéen," sponsored by the cineclub Jean Vigo and the city of Montpellier. 70 For an English translation of this text see Truffaut 224-36. Truffaut's famous manifesto of the Nouvelle vague first appeared in 1954.</page><page sequence="11">108 Angela Dalie-Vacche Lang, Dreyer, Füller, Hawkes, and Hitchcock. Despite Scola's expatriate identity, Ballando ballando is a nationally contained film whose characters never venture beyond the boundaries of the ballroom, an allegorical représentation of French national territory. As soon as songs, clothing, and fads from the outside break into this sealed space, foreign signs become semiotically assimilated within a patriotic universe. In a similar fashion, recent Italian cinema, with its représentations of the Fascist regime and of the postwar period, preserves the national consciousness of neorealism. The persistence of this orientation suggests that at the heart of neorealism lies an unresolved contradiction between stylistic novelties and an ideological continuity of address to national audiences, whether they are those at the end of the war or those of the television âge. 3. Gestures and History in Neorealism, the Tradition of Quality, and the Nouvelle vague Under the influence of neorealism, a new awareness of the relation between physical being and theatrical persona marks the shift from the Tradition of Quality to the Nouvelle vague. The Nouvelle vague filmmaker delights in allowing habituai gestures, tics, and behavioral patterns of a performer to take over the script, either through improvisation or by allowing the camera to linger on the actors as they Step out-of-character, or on those lapses of time, the "empty" pauses between more structured involvements with the dramatic action.21 This interest in the body of the performer recalls the challenge posed by the commedia dell'arte to French baroque painting and theatre, which are heavily dépendent on literary sources. In Word and Image, Norman Bryson recaptures the privileging of Arlecchino's body over a highly-wrought French play for the Académie where logos prevails over somatic features: The Italian comedy breaks with this tradition. Its actìng is less verbal and script 11 Despite his loose connections with neorealism, Antonioni's direction of acting falls within this tradition: "Ritenevo, in effetti, che fosse giusto non abbandonare i personaggi nei momenti in cui, esaurito l'esame del dramma o perlomeno quello che del dramma interessava, le punte drammatiche più intense, il personaggio rimaneva solo con se stesso, con le conseguenze di quelle scene o di quei traumi o di quei momenti psicologici così violenti che avevano avuto indubbiamente su di lui una determinata funzione e l'avevano fatto progredire psicologicamente verso un ulteriore momento" (Tinazzi 6-7; "I thought, after ali, that it was right not to abandon the characters in those moments in which, the analysis of the drama completed, or at least of what was interesting in the drama, its most intense climaxes completed, the character would remain alone with himself, with the conséquences of those scenes or of the traumas or of those intense psychological moments which undoubtedly had a determining function and made him progress psychologically towards the subséquent moment.")</page><page sequence="12">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 109 dominateci and far more closely-bound to somatic character-typing, and to physical exertion; whoever plays Arlecchino needs the stamina of an acrobat. Each of the stock characters has its specialized physique. . . . Already these rules dislodge the supremacy of the script. (114) Bryson uses this association of Italy with the bodily and France with logos to shed light on Watteau's project of elevating the Italian theatre and its protagonists. The vulgär lazzi of the commedia seem infinitely removed from Pantalone's dream-like concentration while he engages in a trivial act endowed with metaphysical résonances: the capture of a fly (Watteau). Yet Bryson's equating of France with the verbal is perhaps overly definitive and forgetful of the challenge brought by Rabelais's irreverent body to a refined literary tradition. Instead of juxtaposing countries, it might be more fruitful to situate the bodily at the center of a conflict between high and populär culture. In France as in Italy the effects of the bodily-grotesque and of the acrobatic-comedic overturn what Brunetta calls "a static system of représentation" ("Il cinema come storia" 50). In the wake of the neorealist experience, the casting and the direction of actors become the most important aspects of a director's job. With Une Femme est une Femme (1961), for example, Godard addresses the relation between Anna Karina the woman and Anna Karina the actress. Likewise in Stromboli, terra di Dio (1951) and in Viaggio in Italia (1953), two stories of cultural différence, Rossellini casts and directs Ingrid Bergman. Like her filmic characters, the actress must come to terms with her personal and professional lives within a Mediterranean environment, as well as with a style of filmmaking différent from Hollywood. In the Tradition of Quality, facial expressions and body movements visually support the narrative and intensify the dialogue. By contrast, in the Nouvelle vague, the use of onomatopoetic sounds as vocal gestures neither contribute to the dialogue nor advance the narrative. Jean Collet cites André S. Labarthe's remarks on Godard's direction of acting: "les mots ne sont pas là pour exprimer quelque chose, mais pour exprimer les personnages. Ce sont des réactifs" (44, "words are not there to convey a message, but to signify the characters. They are reagents"). In Breathless (1960), Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) hums the first syllable of Patrizia's name (Jean Syberg). In this way, he conveys the nervous qualities of his character's energy, his impatience, and his histrionic inclination to play with sounds and facial expressions. Rather than using dialogue, Godard relies on the jazzy beat of Michel's humming to integrate his character into an unpredictable narrative. Like Miles Davis's Soundtrack for Godard's film, Poiccard's voice is an extension of the quick and erratic body movements he performs in front of a métro-station. He energetically opens a newspaper; briefly stops with a jerky forward motion as he reads the headlines reporting that the police are pursuing him; and nervously folds the paper and uses it to shine his shoes before throwing it away. Like a prop for a dance, the</page><page sequence="13">110 Angela Dalle-Vacche paper becomes the center of the prolifération and displacement of Michel's movements. Michel's transformation of the newspaper into a shoe-rag exemplifies his alienated, quasi-Chaplinesque relationship with objects. In a Hollywood film, Humphrey Bogart, Michel's role-model, would have at least glanced through the newspaper article to decide his future course of action. Similarly, in the Tradition of Quality, the use of objects reinforces the codes of verisimilitude. Michel misuses the paper as a shoe-rag or, at the beginning of the film, as a screen behind which to hide. The Tradition of Quality establishes a relationship between narrative and character at the expense of the actor. John Hess argues that in the Nouvelle vague, rather, the actors must, through identification with the roles and through the gestures they develop to express both themselves and the character they represent, reveal their spiritual dimension. (19) In Hollywood acting, as in the Tradition of Quality, the character's voice, physical appearance, body movements, and posture are subordinate to narrative development. In classical American cinema, however, the relations among director, character, and star differ from those developed in French adaptations for the screen. In the Tradition of Quality, the director's construction of character sets the boundaries within which the star can operate. Maria Schell's escalation to stardom, for example, can never completely transcend her initial association with René Clément as the female lead of Gervaise (1956). Clément's choice of title for his adaptation of Zola's L'Assommoir (1909)—scripted by Aurenche and Bost—suggests that even after the making of Gervaise, the popularity of Maria Schell as a star22 born in the Tradition of Quality is bound to nineteenth-century naturalistic fiction. In contrast to the actor in the Tradition of Quality, the Hollywood star enjoys a higher degree of intertextual and intergeneric mobility. The literary sources of the Tradition of Quality dictate the range of roles available to the actor. The scripts of classical Hollywood cinema, conversely, can be custom made with one or more specific stars in mind. While the Tradition of Quality is a cinema where the literary masterpiece rules the actor, Hollywood and Nouvelle vague films are comparable to the extent that they both depend more on the appeal of their star's physical persona than on the authority of high cultural 99 For Gervaise, Maria Schell won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1956. She reached the height of her international réputation with an expensive color co-production by Alexander Astrae, Une Vie (1958), based on the novel of the same title by Guy De Maupassant. Like Clément in Gervaise, Astrae carefully reproduced the period setting of his nineteenth-century literary source. Une Vie seems to be the French équivalent of the Italian calligraphie genre. On the life and career of Maria Schell, see Richards. On the popularity of Schell as a star in Italy, see Chiarini</page><page sequence="14">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 111 sources. They both rely on the formula of "the actor-living-beyond-the-roles" (Beylie 72). The powerful presence of an American star in the construction of a Nouvelle vague character is clearly exemplified by Godard's superimposition of Bogart's tic onto Jean Paul Belmondo's face. Belmondo's mimicry of Bogart's gesture indicates the character's self-image as well as the actor's experience of the gangster's rôle. In Gervaise, Schell's gestures llrmly tie the protagonist's psychology to Zola's depiction of Parisian lower classes in the nineteenth Century. Within this social milieu, the construction of character contributes to the représentation of an historical universe and its effects on individuals as members of a social class. After a violent fïght with her husband's lover, Virginie, Gervaise tidies her hair. This gesture defines her as a working class woman whose daily struggle, in the public lau.ndry, leaves little room for a féminine gesture. The hardship of Gervaise's existence restricts her womanhood to a behavior of conformity, of imitation of wealthier classes. A conflict emerges from this use of behavior: in Zola's narrative the exploration of an individuai dimension is subordinate to the représentation of class différence. Moreover, Gervaise's physical handicap is a metaphor for her inability to move and behave like an attractive woman. Akin to her gestures, this handicap reverberates more with social than with existential connotations. As a cripple, Gervaise is trapped in the lowest Stratum of society. In opposition to the highly ahistorical, nearly unconscious movement of Nouvelle vague actors—Jean-Paul Belmondo's lipstroke à-la-Humphrey Bogart in Breathless—in Gervaise, a pattern of choral gesturing defines the women in the laundry as members of the same social class. Düring the Tight scene, their stance with hands placed firmly on hips characterizes them as a collectivity, rather than as single individuals. The aggressive and masculine connotations of the hands-on-hips posture of the group are in opposition to Gervaise's individualized, feminine movement. Yet, the choral gesturing of the women points out Gervaise's rôle as the protagonist of the fiction. This juxtaposition between a collective posture and an individuai gesture of femininity echoes the tension between a sexual and a social being. It also rearticulates in narrative terms a dialectic of sexual rôles and material conditions of existence, of individuai and class, of gender and society. Whereas in the Tradition of Quality gestures ground the character solely in historical conditions or social class, in the Nouvelle vague gestures highlight the situation of the actor who consciously expériences a role. The exploration of a role by an actor is comparable to the fitting of body and soul, behavior and morality. Thus, gestures become visual vehicles as they allow the spectator to enter an existential dimension, which a traditional construction of character would have downplayed in order to privilège codes of historical verisimilitude. Although many film historians23 have argued that the Nouvelle vague is the first 2*ï Armes explains that: "The New Wave . . . captures the surface texture of French life in a</page><page sequence="15">112 Angela Dalle-Vacche French movement to represent adequately its contemporary era, i.e., the new youth culture of Paris, gestures do proliferate independently of the narrative. They also call attention to themselves and undermine the dictum of acting-in character. Vincent Pinel's remarks on Bresson's choice of actors confirm that the Nouvelle vague learns fforn neorealism to equate acting and being, whereas in the Tradition of Quality acting always means interpreting. According to Pinel, le système de Bresson consiste à chercher un interprète présentant la plus grande ressemblance morale possible avec le personnage, puis à créer ce dernier à partir de la personnalité réelle de l'interprète choisi. ... Le rôle de l'auteur consiste alors à révéler la personnalité profonde de son interprète, à l'intégrer à la tonalité du film et à créer ainsi le personnage. (Pinel 81) (Bresson's system consists in looking for an interpréter whose moral universe resembles as much as possible the character's, in such a way as to construct the latter starting from the real personality of the interpréter chosen .... The rôle of the director, then, is to reveal the deep personality of the interpréter, to integrate him in the general tone of the film and, thus, create the character. ) By emphasizing the gestures of his actors, Bresson suggests that filmmaking is comparable to a moral journey towards an unknown spiritual destination. The director confirms this comparison when he asserts: ce que je cherche, c'est une marche vers l'inconnu. Il faut que le public sente que je vais vers l'inconnu, que je ne sais pas à l'avance ce qui va arriver. (Pinel 82) (what I look for is a movement towards the unknown. It is necessary that the audience realizes that I go towards the unknown, that I do not know ahead of time what is about to happen.) This attitude toward filmmaking and direction of acting is wonderfully exemplified by the relationship between narrative and movement in Pickpocket (1959). Michel's clever hands skillfully move in unfamiliar purses, bags, and pockets without knowing the outcome of their search. The probing of the pickpocket's hands in the dark is comparable to the movement of Bresson's camera in metaphorical darkness at the beginning of a new film. In the opening crédits, a short paragraph establishes a parallel between pickpocketing and beginning a spiritual journey. Towards the end of the film, Michel acknowledges that the outcome of his journey is the discovery of love: "Oh, Jeanne, what a stränge path I had to take to find you."24 The movement of fresh way. . . . But this contemporary flavour was not accompanied by any real social or politicai concern on the part of the new filmmakers" (169). ^ Bresson's use of movement as a metaphor for a spiritual search justifies the parallel which Daniel Miliar draws between Le Journal d'un curé de campagne (1950) and Pickpocket: "Even</page><page sequence="16">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 113 Michel's hands becomes a dynamic metaphor for his long search for Jeanne's love. For the French Nouvelle vague, Italian neorealism means the development of a new acting style and casting criteria where the corporality of the actor has priority over the words of the script. Düring a discussion on his casting techniques, Rossellini explains to Cahiers that he chooses his non-professional actors "solely by the way they look."25 In contrast to the classical Hollywood style, Rossellini does not construct characters, but rather observes the behavior of his non-actors. They are never required to act in character, but simply to be themselves on the screen. In Paisà, for example, the Sicilian protagonist of the first épisode is a local woman Rossellini accidentally met while walking down a pier. Likewise, the inhabitants of the Po Valley episode bring to the screen the éloquence of their faces, postures, and incompréhensible dialect. In Umberto D, Carlo Battisti, a professor of Linguistics from Florence, plays the main role. De Sica's task does not consist in teiling Battisti what to do or how to act to become Umberto D, but in observing the professor's daily gestures, while this non-actor discovers the dignity and the values of the "Umberto D" he already is. Acting in character is thus replaced by finding the character within the actor. Both Rossellini and De Sica want to establish a new relationship between actor and character. Even if he works with Professionals, Bresson's techniques are comparable to those of the neorealist directors, for he pays close attention to his actors' ordinary movements. Daniel Miliar argues that the French director finds the character of the pickpocket in the behavior of Martin Lassalle: Martin Lassalle's shifts, waverings, uncertainties, resorts to rhetoric, empty-eyed évasions, add up to a Michel who spends the whole film discovering his trae self, so, the possibility that Michel functions as a sort of reversed mirror-image of the curé de campagne need not be dissmissed out of hand—and is, even reinforced by Bresson's décision to invent a written text for Michel, since none already existed. Certainly, this "journal d'un pickpocket de ville," of which we hear much more than we see, is nearer a spiritual confession than a legai statement, though naturally without the references to God and to movements of the soul which occupy much of the curé's attention" (Cameron 85). For the director's own remarks on his direction of actors, see Bresson. 25 Overbey quotes Rossellini on casting and direction of acting: "It is too often believed that neo-realism consists in finding an unemployed person to play an unemployed person. I choose actors solely by the way they look. You can choose anyone in the Street. I prefer non-professional actors because they have no preconceived ideas. I watch a man in life and fix him in my memory. When he finds himself before the camera, he is usually completely lost and tries to 'act,' which is exactly what must be avoided at ali costs. There are gestures which belong to this man, the ones he makes with the same muscles which become paralyzed before the lens. It is as if he forgets himself, as if he never knew himself. He believes he has become a very exceptional person because someone is going to film him. My task is to return him to his originai nature, to reconstruct him, to reteach him his usuai movements" (98). More specifically, on Rossellini's choice of actors for Paisà, see the fascinating testimonies gathered by Faldini and Fofi 108-9.</page><page sequence="17">114 Angela Dalie-Vacche who therefore exists only after the film. (Cameron 88) Both De Sica and Bresson construct characters to illuminate the moral being of their actors. Yet Battisti, a non-actor, is "Umberto D" even before the film is shot. De Sica casts him with the implicit assumption that, as Fellini has argued, "ali the faces are always right, life does not make mistakes."26 Martin Lassalle, on the contrary, a professional actor, can discover the "Michel" in him only after making the film. Through the character "Umberto D," Carlo Battisti learns about an inner self which the presence of the camera might have inhibited. Through "Michel," Lassalle discovers a new self which can only emerge as the resuit of an interaction with Bresson's camera. De Sica's casting takes place under the sign of a calculated guess, whereas Bresson's direction of acting takes place under that of an unforeseeable discovery.27 9fì In an interview with Giovanni Grazzini, Fellini illustrâtes his casting criteria: "Anche la mia scelta degli attori è un po' particolare, nel senso che con tutta la stima, la simpatia, la complicità che provo da sempre per gli attori, quando mi accingo a sceglierne uno per un personaggio di un mio film non sono attratto dalla sua bravura, nel senso comune che si dà a questo termine, di capacità professionale, impostazione; come, scegliendo un non-attore, non sono trattenuto dalla sua mancanza di esperienza. Per me è il personaggio che deve coincidere con l'attore. Vado in cerca di facce che dicano tutto di sé al primo apparire sullo schermo; tendo anzi a sottolinearne i caratteri, a evidenziarli col trucco, col costume, proprio come avviene con le maschere [della commedia dell'arte] dove è già tutto chiaro, comportamento, destino, psicologia. La scelta dell'attore per il personaggio che ho in mente dipende dalla faccia che mi trovo davanti, da ciò che mi comunica e anche da ciò che mi permette di intuire, di riconoscere, di indovinare dietro. Non costringo l'inteprete a entrare in panni non suoi, preferisco fargli esprimere quello che può. H risultato, per me, è sempre positivo; ognuno ha la faccia che gli compete, non può averne un'altra: e tutte le facce sono sempre giuste, la vita non sbaglia" (Grazzini 80; "My casting of actors is also a little peculiar, in the sense that despite ali the esteem, sympathy, complicity I have always felt for actors, when I am about to choose one of them for a character in one of my films I am not attracted by his talent, in the traditional sense of the word, or by his professional skills or training; likewise, when choosing a non-actor, I am not worried about his lack of experience. For me it is the character which must coincide with the actor. I look for faces that say everything about themselves as soon as they appear on the screen; I even like to underline the features of these faces, making them more apparent with make-up and costuming, just like it happens with the masks [of the commedia dell'arte] where everything is instantly clear, behavior, fate, psychology. The choice of the actor for the character I have in mind dépends on the face in front of me, from what it communicates to me and also from what it allows me to perceive by intuition, to recognize, to guess behind it. I do not oblige the interpréter to step into alien clothing, I prefer to make him express what he can. The resuit, for me, is always positive; everybody has the face he deserves, he cannot have a différent one: and ali the faces are always right, life does not make mistakes"). 97 Overbey quotes Zavattini's views on actors that are relevant to De Sica's films: "I have often had to explain that I do not wish to prohibit actors from playing in films. Of course actors have a place in films, it is simply that they have very little to do with neo-realistic cinema. The neo-realistic cinema does not ask those men in whom it is interested to have the talent of actors; their professional aptitudes have to do with the profession of being men.</page><page sequence="18">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 115 In De Sica's and in Bresson's direction of acting, the emphasis is on the actor experiencing the role. This process endows Lassalle—and Bresson's camera—with the knowledge of a new spiritual dimension. In De Sica's cinema, filmmaking is not a journey but a catalyst whose only purpose is to let the "Umberto D" in Battisti emerge. In Scola's Ballando ballando, actors and adresses have no need to experience a role. In fact, they are there, on the screen, as living stereotypes, whose selves are forever imprisoned within their own physical appearances. The distance between acting and being is collapsed into being as such. Without any inhibition, but with the self-confidence of the obvious, the unmistakable, the easily recognizable, they enter the ballroom and stare at themselves in the mirror. They unashamedly offer themselves to the inquisitive gaze of the camera which coincides with that of the audience meeting the characters for the first time, one after another, as in a silent film. This direct exchange of looks between characters and audience suggests that narrative pleasure is dépendent on an identification with these characters' bodies. They are mirror images of a national self, grafted on to stereotypes of class, of regional and of sexual différence. 4. Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style Unlike Rossellini and De Sica, Scola in Ballando ballando does not work with non-professional actors, but undertakes an equally radicai project in the anti literary vein of neorealism. He casts the twenty-four members of the professional troupe of Le Théâtre du Campagnol, which had already performed on stage the one hundred and forty rôles of Ballando ballando, a piece originally conceived with only music, dance, and pantomime by Jean-Claude Penchenat.28 In keeping with Penchenat's idea, Scola rejects verbal dialogue in the cinematic version. He deprives the actors of the privileged signifier of the stage, the performance of the written word, thus focusing on movement and enhancing the cinematic potential of Penchenat's text. Without speech, Scola's actors cannot rely on their talent as interpreters of a traditional script in order to act-in character. The men and the women of Le Théâtre du Campagnol seem to be in Scola's Ballando ballando for two major reasons. First, they have been cast so eloquently on the basis of their physical appearance that, by themselves, they can already tell a story without words. They are not traditional, well-rounded They need to be made aware of this, of course, which is the responsibility of the cinema. It is evident that this awareness can only be created or reinforced through the knowledge which we give them of themselves, knowledge which we will attain through neo-realistic cinema" (75). 90 On the production of Ballando ballando for the stage and for the screen, see the special dossier in Revue du cinéma 49-60.</page><page sequence="19">116 Angela Dalie-Vacche characters, but male and female bodies of one hundred and forty recognizable French stereotypes. S cola's project, therefore, is to observe the extent to which their behavior in the ballroom slowly changes over a span of fifty years punctuated by rapid politicai transformations. In Ballando ballando, French audiences have not simply found a contemporary version of the neorealist canon of typecasting. In contrast to Rossellini's and De Sica's early films shot in the streets in a documentary vein, with non-professional actors, Scola's film proposes a theatrical and allegorical view of history. Spectacle and allegory fit within a tradition of Italian culture that neorealism rejects in reaction to the bombastic and nationalist films produced in the 1930s by the Fascist regime. But the aftermath of neorealism, with its involution, demonstrates that this rejection is more a change of scale than a radicai turning over a new leaf, more a sliding from the operatic to the comedic. The theatrical mise-en-scène of Ballando ballando turns the dance floor into a sort of laboratory space where Scola can conveniently observe the ways in which historical circumstances shape individuai behavior. The représentation of behavior on the screen is comparable to a set of instructions that provide the viewers with a term of identification, a mirror image of what they need to see themselves as, in order to have access to a national identity and imagine their roles in the historical process. Texts inserted within the signifying system we cali "national cinema" ask viewers to pay a price for the pleasure provided by identification: namely, a subject-positioning aligned with the discourse of a national technology on class, on regional and on sexual différence. Scola's interest in recording the spectacle of the past exemplifies an attitude shared by other Italian filmmakers in the 1970s. Like Scola in Ballando ballando, Fellini, Zeffirelli, Wertmuller, and Bertolucci rely heavily on choreographed screen directions, theatrical fighting, and vivid costuming. But with Scola, the operatic impulse intersects with the legacy of the commedia dell'arte, thus leading to a magnification of small gestures. Scola's integration of the these two traditions, I believe, indicates that the neorealist experience as well as the silent and Fascist historical films are relevant to an understanding of recent Italian cinema. In looking at the past, post-neorealist Italian cinema oscillâtes between the noisiness of a circus barker and the silent gaze of a voyeur. In his essay on "Theatre and Cinema," Bazin compares the impulse of cinema toward spectacle to a crystal chandelier and its inquiring nature to a flashlight. The French critic writes: If one were called upon to offer in comparison a symbol other than this artifici al crystal-like object, brilliant, intricate and circular, which refracts the light which lays around its center and holds us prisoners of its aureole, we might say of the cinema that it is the little flashlight of the usher, moving like an uncertain cornet across the night of our waking dream, the diffuse space without shape or frontiers</page><page sequence="20">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 117 that surrounds the screen, (107) Like the headwaiter, who appears at the beginning of the film to light up the dance floor and to restore to life this space of illusion, Scola plays with two kinds of lighting: the chandelier for Staging a collective spectacle and the flashlight for illuminating the détails of ordinary behavior. Bazin's juxtaposition of the crystal chandelier and the usher's flashlight can be applied to the whole history of Italian cinema. Cinema as a crystal chandelier has the function of shedding a glorifying halo on the regime. This cinema of spectacle obliges discomforting images to remain latent until the advent of neorealism, which, like a flashlight, illuminâtes a reality of désolation. Recent Italian cinema avails itself of both an operatic and a comédie mode of représentation. Its historical imagination relies on the chandelier to look back at the Fascist regime with fascination. Consider, for example, the controversial Claretta (1984) by Pasquale Squittieri and La storia (1985) by Luigi Comencini, or Bertolucci's II conformista (1970) and Cavani's II portiere di notte (1974). These directors Spotlight the outline of those repressed images that inhabit the subconscious régions of both an individual's subjectivity and that of an entire culture. Bazin's juxtaposition of the crystal chandelier and of the flashlight also illuminâtes the experience of going to the cinema. In the darkness of the movie theatre, the spectator's pleasure is private and solitary, rather than public and partieipatory. His behavior is voyeuristic and secret in contrast to the exhibitionistic attitude of Scola's characters resurrected from the past for the screen. The conditions of the encounter between cinema and history are always public and spectacular. Anything that appears on the screen is always bound to be on display. More forcefully than any other kind of narrative, a film set in the past reminds the spectator that his or her social identity does not exist in a vacuum. Even in Rossellini's présent tense cinema, which replaces the stars of Fascist epics with non-professional actors, the position of the spectator in relation to the historical process is defined by the way in which a contemporary reality is rendered into narrative. The Nouvelle vague filmmakers read American film genres against the grain while glorifying the stars and the myths of Hollywood. The impulse at work in Ballando ballando feeds on an equally powerful tension. In bringing together the immediaey of the actors' corporality and an extremely artificial mise-en-scène, Ballando ballando voices the ambition of Scola's work: to draw upon and to weave together two competing strains in the history of Italian cinema: the operatic and the comédie. Eventually the anonymous, stereotypical neorealist characters (the mother and the Resistance fighters of Roma città aperta, the workers of Vergano's II sole sorge ancora, 1946, the prostitute and the nurse of Paisà) become molds for accommodating an allegorical scheme of emblematic figures from French politicai, cultural, and cinematic history: from Philippe</page><page sequence="21">118 Angela Dalle-Vacche Pétain to Jean Gabin, from Juliette Gréco to the students of May '68, from the red flags of the Populär Front and the spaghetti of the Italian immigrant couple to the fishnet on panty-hose and Michelle by the Beatles. Ballando ballando differs, however, from the historical Hollywood film in its use of cultural clichés. There the commonplaces of the past do not draw attention to themselves but function only to authorize the fiction and to guarantee its historical verisimilitude. By contrast, Scola's blatant use of clichés in Ballando ballando adds a self-reflexive edge to this text, which ultimately tries to redefine the boundaries between cinematic and historical représentation. All the clichés of Ballando ballando suggest that in representing the past cinema becomes a collector of images it raids from disparate areas of culture: literature, history, pop-music, painting, and advertisement. This omnivorous nature leads cinema to disregard historical documents—in the traditional sense of the term—in favor of any element of populär historical knowledge. In dominant narrative cinema, history can only be a représentation that homogenizes the documentary with the legendary in order to feed the historical imagination of its audiences. Ballando ballando goes against the grain of a traditional représentation of the past on the screen. In Scola's allegorical mìse-en-scène, every element calls attention to its emblematic nature, and, from Pétain to the panty-hose, ali these elements acquire the same degree of significance. For Scola there are no clichés that are less stereotypical and therefore more truthful than others. Images, sounds, gestures, and lights from the past, as clichés, enjoy comparable status on Scola's screen, even though they have been produced under différent historical circumstances and have circulated in culture in différent ways. Yet, Ballando ballando is not just a film about clichés from the past. It is also about the plurality of dimensions that constitute the history of a nation. Scola weaves together the Strands of différent kinds of historiés, ranging from politicai to musical, from fashion to film, and, in the process, he also recounts the history of the relations between the sexes. Ail these différent historiés do not move at the same speed. World War II breaks out, Nazism enters France, rock and roll arrives, the slogans of May '68 are chanted. But, in the midst of ali this, the behavioral conventions between men and women—the approach, the chase, the flirt, the rejection—either evolve very slowly or hardly change at ail. As Foucault explains in The Archeology of Knowledge, history is not a single-layered process but the resuit of an accumulation of sedimentary strata, of processes of long duration: "Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving historiés" (3).29 ^ In his latest film, La famiglia (1987), Scola continues to underline the historical dimension, the long duration of sounds, movements and objects in private life. On the représentation of history in Scola's La famiglia, Maria Pia Fusco writes: "L'esterno, la strada, e quindi la Storia non ci sono, si sentono non solo attraverso i rumori, la radio, la</page><page sequence="22">Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style 119 Foucault's "apparently unmoving historiés" bring our argument full circle: we return to the intersection of cinema and history in the bodies of neorealist non-professional actors, to Brunetta's description of "an apparently immobile landscape and body politic" ("Il cinema come storia" 50). The traditional document belongs to the realm of fast-moving surface events. Ironically, it is the movement of the dancers themselves that, according to the perspective of an Annaliste, inhabits the level of the "apparently immobile." It is at this latter level, I believe, that Scola, the historian-filmmaker, is interested. In Ballando ballando Scola attempts to demonstrate that the filmmaker, rather than the traditional historian, can better represent these layers that move more slowly and thus tell a history of looks, of gestures, and of movements, as if these last three elements existed at the precise intersection of nature and culture, on the edge between truth and fiction, writing and living, acting and being. The old-fashioned expression "motion pictures" underlines the two major components of cinema: audio-visual narrative and movement. A written narrative can acquire the authority of a truthful version of the past; for an audiovisual one, however, this is already a more difficult task to achieve. Indeed, historians have come to view movement as an unacceptable document. Until recently history has been unable to deal with those aspects of human existence that do not fall neatly into catégories, whether under the rubric of culture or of nature, in the domain of abstract, intellectual thought or in that of concrete, physical limitations. Is it possible that the problems encountered by film historians will promote the diffusion of the "new" history and thus redefine the boundaries of what historians heretofore have considered to be their object of study? At the turn of the Century, the advent of cinema rearranged the relations among the arts. Now that we live in the society of spectacle, in the age of the image, and that the study of cinema has become an académie enterprise, perhaps the new role of film and télévision studies will consist in stimulating other disciplines to rethink their methodological premises. The encounter of cinema and history is characterized by a mixture of tension and attraction. Scola's juxtaposition of black-and-white photography with color dance-sequences comments on the confrontation between two domains of competency. The appearance of a photograph is always accompanied by an emphatic explosion and a freezing of the frame. Life stops, movement is arrested, the historical document for the records of posterity is born through the death of the moving image. Without the documentary authority of a black and televisione, non solo negli oggetti e nelle cose della casa che il tempo modifica, ma soprattutto nei comportamenti dei personaggi, nel linguaggio che la vicenda pubblica influenza" (20; "The outside, the Street, and, therefore, Ifistory are not there, one hears them not only through noises, the radio and the television, not only in the objects and household matters that time changes, but above all in the behavior of the characters, in the language which public events affect").</page><page sequence="23">120 Angela Dalle-Vacche white photograph, dance, conversely, becomes a représentation of bodies set in motion by sexual desire or by a sense of attachment to a national community. With its connotations of truthfulness, photography constitutes the medium most easily associated with a traditional view of history. Black-and-white still photographs, however, exhibit a death-like quality which is antithetical to the ambition of cinema and of dance: both art forms seek to represent life-in motion, a history of hidden layers in the making, with or without documents. Through this juxtaposition between photography and dance, document and movement, Scola furnishes a text wilhin whose context I wish to situate Foucault's remark on the rhythm of history. Foucault's "new" unmoving historiés can be situated within the history of Italian cinema itself, traditionally split between a phenomenological realism and a spectacular imagination. A possible subtitle for Ballando ballando might be: "Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style." Indeed, the French-Italian connection that I have traced through Scola's film is stylistic as well as historiographical. In this way, the composite style of Ballando ballando sheds light on the rôle of Italian neorealism in the shift from the Tradition of Quality to the Nouvelle vague, as well as on the impact of les enfants terribles of French cinema on the Italian cinema of today. This interweaving of competing cinematic traditions produces a fabric made up of the différent positions taken on by a canonical mode—whether it be that of Fascist cinema, of Hollywood, or of the Tradition of Quality—against which the national cinémas of France and Italy have been set, in an oscillation of love and hate, of rejection and recovery.
