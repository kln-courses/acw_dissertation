ABSTRACT Thirty-seven SID side impact sled tests were performed using a rigid wall and a padded wall with fourteen different padding configurations. The Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI) and Average Spine Acceleration (ASA) were measured in each test. TTI and ASA were evaluated in terms of their ability to predict injury in identical cadaver tests and in terms of their ability to predict the harm or benefit of padding of different crush strengths. SID ASA predicted the injury seen in WSU-CDC cadaver tests better than SID TTI. SID ASA predicted that padding of greater than 20 psi crush strength is harmful (ASA &gt; 40 g's). SID TTI predicted that padding of greater than 20 psi crush strength is beneficial (TTI &lt; 85 g's). SID TTI predicts the benefit of lower impact velocity. However, SID ASA appears more useful in assessing the harm or benefit of door padding or air bags. INTRODUCTION In the United States side impact kills about 8,000 automobile occupants annually and seriously injures another 24,000 (ref. 6). Additional deaths and injuries occur in vans and light trucks. The new federal side impact standard, FMVSS 214 was instituted to reduce death and injury that occur as a result of thoracic trauma in automotive broadside collisions. FMVSS 214 utilizes the SID dummy. In the SID, a chest acceleration measure called the Thoracic Trauma Index, TTI(d), determines whether a car passes the new standard. TTI(d) must be below 85 g's in four door cars and below 90 g's in two door cars (6). TTI(d) is obtained by filtering the SID upper and lower struck side rib accelerations and lower spine lateral acceleration with NHTSA specified FIR 100 software and then averaging the greater of the peak rib accelerations with peak spine acceleration as follows: TTI(d) = 0.5*(max RlBy + T12y) 1852 TTI is a measure of injury probability based on 84 cadaver tests reported by Eppinger et al. (4) and Morgan et al. (11). Another injury criterion that utilizes lateral acceleration was developed by Cavanaugh et al. (3). This measure is called Average Spine Acceleration (ASA). ASA is the average lateral acceleration of the spine at the T12 vertebra during a lateral impact. It represents the average rate of change of velocity of the lower thoracic spine during a lateral impact. In contrast, peak lateral accelerations represent only a small portion of the impact event. ASA is obtained as follows: 1) Filter the T12-y spine acceleration at 300 Hz (Butterworth filter). 2) Integrate the filtered spine acceleration to obtain spine velocity. 3) Take the slope of the spine velocity between specified points. This slope (Figure 1) is the Average Spine Acceleration (ASA). ASA 10 is taken between 10 and 90% of peak spine velocity, ASA 15 between 15 and 85% of peak spine velocity and ASA20 between 20 and 80% of peak spine velocity. ASA15 has shown more consistency than ASA10 and is used in the discussion below. As reported in Cavanaugh et al. (3) the following conclusions were made regarding ASA: 1) ASA performed better than peak acceleration in the combined data base of 70 NHTSA, WSU and GM side impact cadaver tests and 2) It performed as well as TTI in discriminating AIS 4 + injury from lower injury in the combined NHTSA-Wayne State data base of 56 cadaver sled tests. The following summarizes the probability of AIS 4 level injury using ASA, T1 2 Y and cadaver TTI based on a Weibull analysis of 56 cadaver sled tests (3).</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

Age and mass-scaled ASA of less than 30 g's is well tolerated by the human cadaver. ASA of 30 to 40 g's is a transition zone. ASA greater than 40 g's is intolerable and produces AIS 4 and 5 level injury. The present study focuses on ASA and TTI in the SID dummy. In previous work the SID was shown to produce TTI values well-below the federal limit of 85 g's in twenty-mile-per-hour impacts into stiff padding (&gt; 20 psi crush strength) (1, 9). Both NHTSA and WSU cadaver data show that this type of impact is intolerable to post-mortem subjects greater than 50 years old and produces AIS 4 and 5 level injuries in these subjects (2). The purpose of the present study was to determine if SID ASA has any advantages over TTI in this regard. The results of this study indicate that SID ASA predicts that stiff padding is harmful whereas TTI(d) does not. Thus, SID ASA appears to be a valuable tool in assessing the benefits of interior padding and side air bags. 1853</page><page sequence="3">METHODS A deceleration sled (WHAM III) was accelerated to fifteen or twenty miles per hour and suddenly decelerated upon impacting a hydraulic snubber. During the deceleration, the SID dummy slid across a Teflon™ seat into a wall instrumented with nine load cells. The SID dummy and impact wall are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. The SID dummy (without jacket) adjacent to the impact wall. The velocity of the wall was zero at time of dummy impact. The load plates at shoulder, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic levels were each instrumented with two load cells. In the padded tests each load plate was covered with a four inch high X sixteen inch long piece of padding. The material properties and thickness of the padding are shown in Table 1. The velocity of the wall was zero at time of dummy impact. The velocity of the dummy just before impact was close to peak sled velocity. The dummy was instrumented with accelerometers to measure rib, spine, pelvic and head accelerations. Two high speed cameras at 500 frames per second were used to monitor the event. One was a front view and one a rear view camera. The data presented here focuses on the 1854 struck side upper and lower rib accelerations and the lower thoracic spine lateral acceleration in unpadded and padded wall tests. In six test types the SID was run at identical velocity and with identical wall padding as the WSU- CDC cadaver tests. These test types are as follows: 1) fifteen miles per hour (6.7 m/s) unpadded. 2) twenty miles per hour (8.9 ms) unpadded. 3) wall padded with six inches of soft paper honeycomb (approximately 10 psi (69 kPa) at all load plates). 4) wall padded with four inches of soft paper Honeycomb (approximately 1 0 psi at thorax and abdomen load plates, 20 psi (138 kPa) at shoulder and pelvis load plates) 5) wall padded with four inches of stiff paper honeycomb (approximately 20 psi at thorax and abdomen load plates, 30 psi (207 kPa) at shoulder and pelvis load plates) 6) wall padded with three inches of ARSAN 601. Test conditions 3) through 6) were run at sled velocities of twenty miles per hour. RESULTS Specific findings comparing SID ASA to TTI are described below. The data summarizing these findings are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 lists results for each test and Table 2 lists average values by test type. A COMPARISON OF SID ASA AND TTI TO CADAVER INJURY LEVELS IN IDENTICAL TESTS Table 2 presents average values of ASA1 5 and TTI in the SID tests and similar data for the cadaver tests. The cadaver sample size ranges from one to twelve for each test condition as shown in the Table. The cadaver data is taken from both the WSU and NHTSA sled test data bases. Figure ЗА plots average cadaver maximum AIS (MAIS) to the thorax vs. cadaver TTI kernel for these six test types. The TTI kernel does not include an age factor. Figure 3B plots cadaver MAIS vs. SID TTI for these six test types. Figure 3C plots cadaver MAIS vs. cadaver ASA15 and Figure 3D plots cadaver MAIS vs. SID ASA15. Figure 3E and F plot similar data for peak T12-y. These plots reflect the data in Table 2. It can be seen by a review of these plots that as cadaver injury increases from MAIS 2 to 4, ASA15 increases. SID ASA15 increases in a similar manner, although the transition from mild to moderate injury is not as clear. There is not the same transition when using SID TTI or cadaver TTI. In two cases (ARSAN 601 and 3/4 inch cell size paper honeycomb) SID TTI was well below the FMVSS 214 requirement of 85 g's, and cadaver MAIS 5. Each of these conditions represents only one cadaver test, however.</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 1 : SLED SIDE IMPACTS: SID ACCELERATION DATA I PADDING DĀTĀ CRUSH STRENGTH I ACCELERATION IN G'S (100 HZ FIR FILTERED) | AVERAGE SPINE ACCEL.

Padding crush strength is defined here as the quasi-static compressive strength of the pad after it deformed 33-35% of its total thickness of three to four inches. One can see that as padding crush strength reaches 8-10 psi, ASA and T12-y reach minimum values, and as crush strength approaches 20 psi, ASA and T12-y rise in value, indicating that padding of 20 psi or higher crush strength produces a more severe impact than softer padding. Cadaver injury in WSU-CDC tests reflects this trend (3). On average 10 psi pad produced AIS 2 level injury in five cadavers (AIS range 0-4) and stiffer padding produced AIS 4.5 level injury in four cadavers (AIS range 4-5). In contrast to SID ASA and T1 2-y, SID TTI(d) values are well below 85 g's for both soft and stiff padding ranging from 1 0 to 34 psi crush strength as shown in Figures 4A and B. In particular, the following sled tests demonstrate how SID ASA and TTI differ in predicting the benefits of padding. These test results are listed in Table 1 . A) In SID sled tests three inch thick ARCEL 310 resulted in ASA of 52 g's (test nos. 23, 24) and six inch thick ARCEL 310 resulted in ASA of 47 g's (test nos. 46, 47). This is an intolerable range (&gt; 40 g's). The ARCEL pad crush strength of 28 psi bears this out. This is too stiff for the human thorax. Yet TTI(d) averaged 65 g's and 54 g's for ARCEL of three and six inch thickness, respectively. This is well below the Federal Standard of 85 g's, and would predict that ARCEL provides great benefit. ARCEL is too stiff to provide benefit and ASA shows this. B) The same can be seen with the 3/4 inch cell size paper honeycomb. This has a crush strength of 1 8-25 psi. Four inch thickness resulted in TTI(d) of 57 g's (test nos. 15A and 16A) and eight inch thickness resulted in TTI(d) of 55 g's (test nos. 48, 52), well below the cut-off of 85. ASA in these tests averaged 38 and 40 g's for four and eight inch thickness, respectively. These are values that ASA predicts are close to intolerable. Indeed they were intolerable in two cadaver tests. MAIS was 5 with this padding in CDC SIC 12 and MAIS was 4 with a very similar pad (Verticel honeycomb in CDC SIC 16). C) Similar trends can be seen with ARSAN 601 (test nos. 9, 10, 17 and 18). ASA averaged 53 g's and TTI 66 g's with this padding. Per TTI, ARSAN is provides great benefit and per ASA, the ARSAN impact is virtually certain of producing AIS 4 + level injury. (As stated earlier, the probability of AIS 4 injury is 99% at ASA of 47 g's). In the one cadaver test run with ARSAN (CDC SIC 09) AIS was 5 and the cadaver had over 30 fractures and a lacerated aorta. 1858 DISCUSSION WHY DO SID TTI AND ASA VALUES DIFFER IN PREDICTING PADDING BENEFITS? TTI and ASA in the SID show different trends when used to compare soft padding to stiffer padding. Why is this? A key reason appears to be the large decrease in rib accelerations seen in the SID no matter if the padding is 10, 20 or 30 psi crush strength. The SID chest mass is higher and more concentrated than the human chest mass, so the SID chest can crush padding that the human cannot. As the leading edge of this mass crushes 20-40 psi padding, the accelerations of this leading edge (rib accelerations) drop substantially compared to a rigid wall impact, as seen in Figures 5A- D and Table 1. This produces low TTI's. In contrast, ASA and T12-y do not fall as sharply as rib accelerations when going from an unpadded to a stiff padded condition (Fig. 6). Thus, ASA and T12-y values do not indicate the tremendous benefit in stiff padding that is predicted by SID TTI. Spine acceleration (peak or average) is not as sensitive to the padding interface as is the leading edge of the impacting mass (as reflected by rib accelerations). In fact, ASA and T12-y fall to their lowest values when soft padding (8- 10 psi) is used (Figure 4A,B). SID ASA rises to levels intolerable to the human cadaver (&gt; 40 g's) as the padding exceeds 20 psi crush strength. Thus, SID ASA appears be a better tool than TTI(d) for assessing the potential benefits or harm of door padding or door airbags. Unpublished BIOSID data show that rib accelerations and TTI(d) are sensitive to padding stiffness when the dummy ribs are of low mass. In fact, in the case of BIOSID, TTI(d) was more sensitive to padding stiffness than ASA (AAMA Contract No. WSU 9104-C1 133). SID ASA VS. PEAK T1 2-Y It has been shown that both average and peak spine accelerations in SID discriminate padding harm or benefit. Are there discernable differences between the predictive value of average and peak spine acceleration? As a biomechanical response in SID the two correlate very well (r2 = 0.949). As an injury risk function, ASA is performed better than peak T12-y (Cavanaugh al., 1 993).

TTI(d) for the same tests (Fig. 5) predicts that only the unpadded test is likely to result in serious injury. UNPADDED TESTS - The WSU-CDC cadaver data show that padding greater than 20 psi crush strength at the thoracic and abdominal levels does not readily crush in impacts of 20 miles per hour (8.9 m/s). The cadaver thorax cannot develop enough force to crush the padding. This is demonstrated by reviewing the torso forces in a 20 mile per hour unpadded impact (Figs. 7A-D). The cadaver develops a 3 kN force (675 pounds) at the thoracic load plate (Fig 7AI and a 7 kN force (1574 pounds) at the thoracic plus abdominal load plates (Fig. 7B), normalized to a 75 kg subject. The projected area of the body over the thoracic plate is approximately 36 square inches (four inches high x nine inches wide). This results in a contact pressure of 675/36 = 18.8 psi. The projected area of the body over the thoracic plus abdominal plates is approximately 90 square inches (ten inches high x nine inches wide). This results in a contact pressure of 1574/90 = 17.5 psi. Thus, in a twenty mile per hour impact, the body cannot generate enough force in the thoraco-abdominal area to crush 20 psi padding. Padding of this strength or stiffer approaches a rigid- wall impact condition. A twenty mile per hour rigid-wall impact results in an average AIS of 4 to the thorax based on 15 cadaver tests (Table 3). In these same plots it can be seen that SID forces are substantially higher than cadaver forces. The 30 + kN peak force observed in the SID impact into the shoulder plus thoracic load plates in Figure 7C is very similar to that reported by Irwin et al. (ref. 7, Fig. 19) for the thoracic force plate in 8.9 m/s unpadded tests with a Heidelberg-type side wall. The weight of the SID chest assembly is 29.6 kg (65.2 pounds, ref. 5). The estimated thoracic plus left upper arm mass distribution to the WSU shoulder plus thorax load plates is 16.33 kg (36 pounds) for a 75 kg cadaver (unpublished data). Thus, much of the difference between SID and cadaver 1861</page><page sequence="11">TABLE 3: RIGID WALL SIDE IMPACT CADAVERIC DATA FROM SLED TESTS (NHTSA AND WSU) TEST NO VEL MASS AGE MAIS | MAX TTI I T12Y T12Yx| ASA15 ASA15 ASA1S (MILES/ (KG) RIB KERNELx (G'S) MASS/75 (G'S) xMASS/75 xAGE/45 HOUR) TTI MASS/75 (G^S) (G'S) xMASS/75 H82009 25 50.8 27 5.0 182 144.4 208 141 100.2 67.9 40.7 H82012 25 74.8 17 5.0 153 129.0 156 155 79.2 79.0 29.9 AVG 25 62.8 22 5.0 168 136.7 182 148 89.7 73.4 40.1 76T010 20 88.0 84 4.0 269 151.4 105 123 39.2 46.0 85.8 76T011 20 74.8 69 4.0 242 145.4 166 166 36.0 35.9 55.1 77T089 20 55.3 66 5.0 216 123.5 88 65 40.3 29.8 43.6 77T092 20 58.1 45 4.0 153 90.2 80 62 42.4 32.8 32.8 H80024 20 64.9 24 0.0 144 110.4 134 116 35.1 30.3 16.2 H81002 20 64.9 57 4.0 186 106.3 130 112 83.3 72.1 91.3 H81004 20 79.8 56 4.0 218 139.7 134 143 85.6 91.2 113.4 H82014 20 61.2 22 5.0 H82016 20 49.9 21 2.0 H82020 20 73.0 41 5.0 229 172.0 164 159 38.3 37.3 34.0 WSUSIC04 20 57.6 69 4.0 200 103.4 76 58 53.2 40.8 62.6 WSUSIC06 20 61.2 60 4.0 195 111.0 93 76 47.1 38.5 51.3 WSU SIC01 20 70.3 60 5.0 WSUSIC02 20 49.5 64 5.0 181 91.4 116 77 69.5 45.8 65.3 WSU SIC03 23 69.9 37 5.0 188 136.2 128 119 80.8 75.3 62.2 AVG 20 65.2 52 4.0 202 123.4 118 106 54.2 48.0 59.5 H80011 15 88.9 27 2.0 1 63 125.3 90 107 18.4 21.8 1 3.1 H80017 15 69.9 38 2.0 129 76.1 74 69 32.8 30.5 25.9 H82018 15 84.8 28 3.0 128 88.7 71 80 19.8 22.3 13.9 H82019 15 66.7 47 3.0 167 101.1 85 76 18.4 16.3 17.1 WSUSIC05 15 44.0 67 4.0 150 56.2 92 54 68.7 40.3 60.1 WSU SIC07 15 74.8 66 4.0 172 79.6 42 42 31.6 31.5 46.3 WSUSIC08 15 73.9 64 5.0 51 50 36.7 36.2 51.6 AVG 15 71.9 48 3.3 | 152 87.8 | 72 68 | 32.3 2&amp;A 32.6 RW = RIGID WALL RW-PO = RIGID WALL WITH PELVIC OFFSET OF SIX INCHES forces can be attributed to differences in mass distribution. STIFF PADDED TESTS - Padding of approximately 20 psi crush strength is a force-limiting pad to SID but not to a cadaver (Figs. 8A-D). In the stiff padded case, peak cadaver forces approach that of the unpadded case, 3-4 kN at the thorax plate and 7-8 kN at the thorax plus abdominal plates, whereas SID forces are reduced substantially with stiff padding. In the stiff padded case, the cadaver forces did not rise as rapidly as in the unpadded case, even with little padding deformation. Observation of the padding showed that it readily crushed using SID but not using the cadaver. Intolerance to stiff padding appears to depend both on subject mass and age. In the four WSU/CDC tests with stiffer padding, average age was 64.8, average mass 55.3 kg and average AIS was 4.5 to the chest. Fifty-five kilogram occupants will not generate the inertial forces of a 75 kg dummy. In 8.5-8.9 m/s cadaveric side impact sled tests reported by NHTSA using padding (2, 4), five of seven cadavers aged 50 and older had AIS 4 or 5 level injuries to the hard thorax, while only one of ten aged 17-49 had AIS 4 or 5 level injury. This suggests that older occupants are likely to experience more serious injury than younger occupants without careful attention to padding design. Stiff padding as inside door trim may be more harmful than no padding (10). Stiff padding effectively moves the impacting door surface closer to the occupant who will experience higher door impact velocities than if the door could traverse the air space and impact the occupant at a reduced velocity. SOFT PADDED TESTS - The WSU/CDC test series demonstrated that padding with a lower crush strength than 20 psi will reduce thoracic injury (3). Figures 9A-D demonstrate that soft padding is a force-limiting pad in cadavers and up to a point in SID. For the cadavers, the padding was force limiting throughout most of the 55 ms impact, but in the SID the padding bottomed out, producing high forces starting at 25 ms into the impact event. This illustrates why SID ASA is not a completely satisfactory measure in soft padding that bottoms out. ASA15 averaged 37 g's in this type of impact (test nos. 11A and 12A, Table 1). ASA was only slightly higher with the stiff padding of Figures 8A-D. ASA averaged 38.4 g's in the latter (test nos. 15A and 16A, Table 1). Based on cadaver tests, the one-inch cell is much better at reducing injury than these small differences in SID ASA would indicate. However, when the pad was increased to eight inches thick, a marked difference occurred. SID ASA15 averaged 27.1 g's with the one-inch cell honeycomb (test nos. 49 and 51) and 39.9 g's with the 3/4 inch cell honeycomb (test nos. 48 and 52), predicting the superiority of soft padding in reducing injuries. LIMITATIONS OF SAMPLE SIZE - The trends suggested by ASA in Figure 3A-F are limited by the fact that three of the data points each represent only one cadaver test. It is recommended that more tests be done with the padding represented by these points to solidify the relationship between SID ASA and cadaver injury. 1862</page><page sequence="12">ä |£ 5 S « Л -О .2 4-1 fl) ..9 &gt; w- О &lt;0 &lt;0 2 s 2 3 D s 2 CT o í &lt;p (i) &lt;л + (i) g « w £ jC 0) +-■ ■M -o w o 2 та 4- O D _ч Л rr 2? _ч сл (D w r; о &lt;ü О) r; о Л CD ^ S и o 2 CD С £ 2 Ū&gt; тэ о э го Vř- С/Э -2 e ig ¿SE pf s &lt;2 с io СО с rv (D С _ 4-» О ■Л ТЗ О ф ~ W * 1 CD ■о .Ы •О ^ 1 m E S m 2 О ¿O S g О 3h Q) d и ™ 0 &lt;D * u 2 fl) л - u fl) л (Dû*, a о S S t о -о £ Eu. ï CD .Q) &gt; D W £ f -Û CD - Ž.īe; 1 о e ť t 1 о 2 с ť о Q5 с i Ž Wb « 0) I'll W С N &gt; S О 1 Ä &gt; 3DO D .?-9 о g и. та со с - + £ -о о та sill w 4-» о та w 4-» о та w ° 4-» и £ о - та Z ц 0) сл + 'E E ^ S S-s 2 о f Э тэ (Л (п О О &gt;- !: (п г О г H|WS H|WS |û £ 2 'S 8f .i?iš IL Л ч- (Л 1863</page><page sequence="13">W .

The WSU/CDC tests are the only tests which have tried to separate out the impact forces at the thorax and abdomen from those at the shoulder. Two tests in a twenty-mile per hour flatwall unpadded condition were run (SIC04 and SIC06). The forces for each match closely (Figures 7A-D). The peak thoracic forces in two other twenty mile-per-hour unpadded tests (SIC01 and SIC 02, with pelvic offset) averaged only 15% higher than these (3). More importantly, the forces are in line with those in a larger data base, that of the International Standards Organization (ISO). ISO corridors have been established to set standards for dummy biofidelity. Some of these corridors are based on Heidelberg cadaver sled tests (ref. 8). Figure 10 shows the ISO shoulder-thoracic response corridor for a twenty-mile- per-hour unpadded sled impact. The ISO corridor forces include inertial forces from the abdomen because of the large gap between the thorax and pelvis plates in the Heidelberg tests. The average peak force of this corridor is 1 1 .6 kN and the range is 8 to 1 5 kN. Figure 10 also shows the average force-time trace in the WSU cadaver twenty-mile-per hour unpadded impacts. The lower trace is the sum of shoulder plus thorax load plates. Peak cadaver forces were approximately 8 kN. The upper trace is the sum of Figure 10. International Standards Organization (ISO) response corridor of the shoulder-thorax load plate in 20 mile per hour Heidelberg sled tests (modified from ISO TR9790-3). Also shown are average force-time traces in the WSU cadaver 20 mile per hour unpadded impacts. The lower trace is the sum of shoulder plus thorax load plates. The upper trace is the sum of shoulder plus thorax plus abdominal load plates. shoulder plus thorax plus abdominal load plates. Peak forces in these are approximately 1 2 kN. The forces are reasonably close to those in the larger Heidelberg data base. They will not compare exactly because the load plates are distributed differently betwen the two test series. OTHER INJURY CRITERIA The Viscous Criterion (VCmax) has been shown to be a good injury function in side impact pendulum tests (Viano et al., 1989) and side impact sled tests (Cavanaugh et al., 1993). It has advantages over ASA in that it will predict local injury as produced by a stiff armrest or aggressive airbag. However, in SID, the current dummy mandated by FMVSS 214, the viscous response is not available and in the interim ASA appears to be a useful measure for assessing the harm or benefit of padding or airbags when performing FMVSS 214 tests. It is recommended that ASA be evaluated in the other SID data bases that have been generated including the large data base of NHTSA. CONCLUSIONS: In the SID, the dummy mandated by FMVSS 21 4 to assess side impact crashworthiness, ASA shows promise as an injury measure based on the following: 1) Average Spine Acceleration (ASA) in SID predicted the injury trends seen in WSU-CDC cadaver tests better than TTI(d). 2) ASA predicted the lack of benefit in padding &gt; 20 psi crush strength. TTI(d) did not. 3) ASA can be partitioned as follows: &lt; 30 g's: low probability of serious injury, 30-40 g's: a transition zone, &gt; 40 g's: high probability of serious injury. ASA may be of particular benefit in protecting occupants over fifty years old, who appear quite sensitive to padding stiffness based on cadaveric tests.
