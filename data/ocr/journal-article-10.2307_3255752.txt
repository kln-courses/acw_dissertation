BUDDHA FROM MATHURA INDIAN, II CENTURY portunity to study the collections under guidance, a series of after- hour talks has been arranged on certain Wednesday afternoons for this season. These begin at five o'clock, lasting for an hour.

BOOKS ON EXHIBITION IN THE LIBRARY. There have been placed on exhibition in the Library three volumes received by the bequest of James W. Corrigan. Each con- tains a short poem by the Duchess of Fewitz, the text written out and illuminated on vellum with borders, initial letters, and other decorations in color and raised gold. Each poem is further embellished with full- page miniatures by Sydney H. Metyard, and with decorative title-pages in color and raised gold. The vol- umes are sumptuously bound in whole levant morocco, inlaid and set with jewels, and have levant doublures and watered silk fly-leaves, elaborately gold-tooled. W. C. THREE MATHURA SCULPTURES. Among the recent additions to our collection of Indian art are three small heads' from Mathura, carved in the mottled red sandstone charac- teristic of the sculpture produced at this great Buddhist center. Two (figs. I and 2) are typi- cal of the Mathuri school in the early Kusdna period, and may be assigned to the second century A.D. The third, dating from about the fifth century A.D., belongs to the Gupta period. The head2 illustrated in figure I repre- sents Buddha. It is a fragment of a carving in high relief. In type it may be compared with the "Bodhisattva" (Buddha) of Friar Bala in the Sdrndth Museum, a dated mon- ument of A.D. I23. Note the heavy, forceful features, the rounded forms, the shaven 1 Exhibited in Gallery E 13. 2 Acc. no. 28.97.2.

This early Mathurd Buddha type derives directly from such monuments of older Indian art as the Yaksas (tutelary divini- ties) at Besnagar (third century B.C.) and Patna (second century B.C.). It is purely indigenous in style and iconography, owing nothing to the Hellenistic influences visible in the contemporaneous Buddha images of the Gandhdran school.4 In the main, the Mathura Bud- dha type is the source from which was evolved the fully de- veloped Buddha image that from the Gupta period on be- came traditional in Indian art and in that of other coun- tries where Bud- dhism flourished.6 The second head,6 of the same period as that first described, is carved in the round, and repre- sents presumably a Bodhisattva (fig. 2), wearing a richly or- namented head- dress. Again, the forms are massive, the features expres- sive of energy and power. Artistically, this head is much superior to the first. The third head is a fragment of a carv- FIG. 2. BODHISATTVA FROM MATHURA INDIAN, II CENTURY ing in high relief.' It is an early example of the developed Buddha type of the Gupta period, A.D. 320-600, when the standardiza- tion of iconography and the perfection of technique gave rise to the suave and grace- ful style of the classic period of Indian art.

The usunisa is represented in the Mathura Buddha type by a spiral lock of hair. 4 At first, it will be recalled, Buddha was repre- sented in art by symbols only. It was not until the latter part of the I century A.D. that the anthropomorphic representation of Buddha came into general use. 5 Ananda K.
