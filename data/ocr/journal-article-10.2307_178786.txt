<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Interpretation of Nature: A Review Article L. J. JORDANOVA University of Essex Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500-1800, by Keith Thomas (London: Allen Lane, 1983; Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984) Man and the Natural World has received an astonishing amount of media attention and has been hailed as a masterpiece on all sides. Two features of the book have apparently impressed commentators: its originality and its wealth of empirical material. The work is indeed an amazingly rich compendium of ideas about all facets of the relationships human beings have with nature, and it has all the qualities of "a good read." It's not often that reviewers can chuckle with pleasure at piquant anecdotes about such things as goats, trees, and vegetarians. Furthermore, its scope is even more extensive than the title suggests, since Thomas draws many of his examples from the nineteenth century and goes well beyond the confines of England in search of illuminat- ing comparisons and traditions to serve his main thesis. This is that the "early modern period" saw a significant, even revolutionary change in man's at- titudes towards nature, in that, at the beginning of this epoch people felt entitled to use nature for human ends, whereas by the end of it there were widespread doubts about this. These manifested themselves in organisations to prevent cruelty to animals, attempts to preserve and conserve the coun- tryside and so on. The main outlines of this interpretation are hard to fault, and they have, in fact, been explored by many other scholars, often in the form of studies of the transition "from the closed world to the infinite uni- verse," as a result of which man no longer held, or felt entitled to hold, pride of place. With the broad contours of the landscape Thomas has depicted for us we cannot quarrel, but we may want to inspect it at closer quarters. My concern here is with the kind of historical knowledge this book has produced, for it draws upon a number of intellectual traditions which work on a broad canvas, painting large suggestive sweeps, while at the same time offering minute, intricate points of supportive detail. The general attraction of such a style of history writing and the equally general approbation with which it is now regarded make it a suitable case for analysis. Thomas locates his work within a particular tradition: "The book is thus 0010-4175/87/1967-2908 $5.00 ? 1987 Society for Comparative Study of Society and History 195</page><page sequence="2">I96 L. J. JORDANOVA intended to do something to reunite the studies of history and literature in the way G. M. Trevelyan continually urged" (p. 16). His volume is, in a number of senses, a self-consciously literary one. First, he draws on a large amount of literary material: poems, diaries, letters, Shakespeare plays, travel accounts, and novels. Second, it is literary in the sense that it is written to evoke vivid sensations, images, and feelings, and so the language it uses is of vital importance in conveying its thesis. Third, Man and the Natural World addresses itself to discourses; it is what people say and write about their feelings towards nature which are of interest, their actual practices less so. In this sense it falls within the same tradition as Philippe Aries's Centuries of Childhood, with the significant difference that Thomas uses much less visual material than Aries did. Both can be located within the "sentiments" ap- proach to social history.' There has been a certain vogue for this style of history writing lately, with the telling anecdote, the apt witticism, and the evocative metaphor conveying the wide learning and cultural urbanity of the author, while the reader is entertained and simultaneously informed about a whole society. In other words, the literariness of the history writing is pur- porting to serve the purpose of summing up, encapsulating larger movements of thought and feeling. Thus, citing Wordsworth is not giving us one person's opinion, which may be as valid, or invalid, as anyone else's. It is calling up before us the sweep of reaction to the Enlightenment which we call Roman- ticism-a new set of sensibilities which, by implication, express a change in English society as a whole. If you put thousands of such quotations together, you have a history of the society in question, a rich tapestry (a word reviewers have used in praise of the book) which is a compelling whole made even more attractive when we look closely and see how deftly the threads have been woven together. And so they have. Thomas piles quotation upon quotation, example upon example, till we marvel at his erudition and feel compelled to step back and admire an ensemble which, when looked at too closely, only dazzles after a while. It is significant, I think, that little recent literary scholarship uses such a method, and it eschews it for a reason. The widespread influence of struc- turalism and psychoanalysis has further encouraged the idea that language is not transparent but opaque, and that to see through, or rather into it, is thus an act of interpretation. Language, of course, works at different levels, gives rise to ranges of meaning, and may, in the last analysis, resist being tied down altogether. Literary studies have become accordingly more theoretical as his- I Another example of the "sentiments" approach is L. Stone, The Family, Sex and Marriage in England, 1500-1800 (London, 1977). There is a critical discussion of this approach in M. Anderson, Approaches to the History of the Western Family 1500-1914, (London, 1980), ch. 3; see also J. W. Scott, "The history of the family as an affective unit," Social History, 4, 509-16 (1979). Thomas's highly critical review of Stone's book is illuminating; Times Literary Supple- ment, 21 October 1977, 1226-27.</page><page sequence="3">INTERPRETATION OF NATURE 197 torical studies favour empiricism. Much work by literary critics has traced the ways in which social conflicts and changes are worked out through language; language mediates social relations. The significance of what is written and said is never self-evident, but requires unravelling. Furthermore, it follows that to do such an unravelling job you need to know what kind of a literary product a text is, the circumstances of its production, and something about its author. Not only do we need proper textual analysis, we also need context in its fullest sense, for until we know about meaning and its social construction we cannot interpret, that is, understand, the historical changes Man and the Natural World posits. To cite writers from different periods and classes, writing within different circumstances and using a wide variety of genres, as if they are commensurable is unjustified. It remains unclear what force there is in a juxtaposition of a sentence about the amount of land enclosed in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth cen- turies with a quotation from Wordsworth about the disappearing wilderness (p. 262). How revealing of general attitudes towards animals is Blake's poem about the robin? (p. 149) Was the medical practitioner Thomas Percival typical when he declared in 1775 that "flies were as capable of pain as men" (p. 179)? What kind of validity can be claimed for the following statement: "an increasing number of scientists would, like Sir Everard Home . . . main- tain that the human mind was but a nice arrangement of matter," especially when the authority cited turns out to be a nineteenth-century memoir of one person by another, neither of them Home himself (p. 124)? This is not to say that the work is without its organising principles. Thomas implies that the new ideas his book charts were mainly the preserve of the educated middle class, and that these were in response to a number of quite concrete social changes, particularly environmental ones, which took place in the early modem period. Yet, at the same time, he suggests these sentiments became increasingly out of tune with reality. "There was thus a growing conflict between the new sensibilities and the material foundations of human society" (p. 303). This statement comes on the last page of the book; the explanation of such a conflict is a task Thomas does not attempt, yet this is surely the crux of the matter. Without such an explanation we are left adrift on the most crucial issue: How do societies work when ideas and feelings are apparently so much at variance with actual experience? Or, to put it another way, how are ideologies produced and sustained? Thomas does not confront such questions, but sidesteps them by speaking of ideas and feelings in terms of taste and fashion, using words like "sympa- thy" or "hypersensitive." This implies that people change in ways which are not amenable to further analysis once they have been described and also that contradictions arise more from human whim than social structure. This is consistent with his methodology of letting glimpsed personal sentiments stand for whole cultural movements. He attempts, for example, no structural expla-</page><page sequence="4">I98 L. J. JORDANOVA nation for why Western capitalist society sentimentalises animals and plants while systematically destroying them. Many historians are indeed resistant to the idea that fashion and fad, like any other aspects of human society, require explanation. It is as if they constitute their own explanation. Yet, to accept such a point of view is to accept that human life is, at some level, a haphaz- ard, even fragmented business, that it is the very complexity of "life's rich tapestry" which produces inevitable contradictions and conflicts, such as the one with which Thomas ends his book. An alternative approach would be to assume that contradictions and con- flicts are connected, that they produce each other, making them not fortuitous chance events at which we can wonder, but expected aspects of social life, which should be sought out and analysed. This would lead us to say that the educated middle class was certainly in the business of producing "culture," the purpose of which was precisely not to reflect accurately their material environment, but to serve their own interests. There are plenty of models of this perspective. Two of them are in the area Thomas covers in the book; both are cited by him in passing, yet little of their analytical structure creeps into Man and the Natural World. The works I have in mind are The Country and the City by Raymond Williams and John Barrell's The Dark Side of the Landscape. What distinguishes them from the Thomas book is their attempt to get to grips with the deployment of ideas by recognising the intensely com- plex relationship between ideology and "life," and the continual interplay between them. It is significant that both scholars come from literary back- grounds and thus respect linguistic complexity. Here is another way of bring- ing history and literature together, one which is also more in keeping with a commitment to an anthropological perspective because it digs for the patterns and structures of social relations, rather than skimming the surface for epi- phenomenal change. Most historians, of course, accept that original materials do not speak for themselves, that they have to be acted upon in order to produce a form of knowledge we call "history." What historians disagree about is exactly what this process involves. Does it, for example, entail finding enough empirical instances to enable a valid generalisation to be made, or does it require the application of theoretical, interpretative methods to the sources in order to make them speak meaningfully to us? And, if we grant that the second is an important task, which theories and methods are most appropriate and suc- cessful? Clearly, there can be no simple or general answers, for these will depend on the nature of the materials as well as of the historian. Nonetheless the questions are worth asking, if only as a reminder that history has the status of "knowledge," whilst primary sources have the status of "evidence" and that the transition from evidence to knowledge is highly problematic. The danger with the vocabulary of subjectivity as Thomas uses it is that it implies that there is no deeper digging to be done, and yet, paradoxically, the</page><page sequence="5">INTERPRETATION OF NATURE I99 book rests its claim to validity on a concealed scientism. Primary materials are treated as data, to be cited, usually without any discussion of the traditions of interpretation which have been applied to them. It is as if they can be taken as "facts." The direct move from the original text to Thomas's discourse as if there were no interpretative gap in between produces a spurious sense of empirical firmness. Of course, once that interpretative gap is acknowledged, the need to enter into dialogue with other intellectual traditions and to give context full weight cannot be denied. Thomas moves casually from the mass of particulars to sweeping generalisations with consummate ease, as when he asserts: "the preoccupation with gardening, like that with pets, fishing and other hobbies, even helps to explain the relative lack of radical and political impulses among the British proletariat" (p. 240). The attached footnote reads simply "cf. the comments of A. Croxton Smith, Dogs since 1900 (1950), preface" (p. 385). The status such remarks are entitled to as knowledge seems to be somewhat limited. As an opinion it is suggestive and amusing. This is one of a number of examples of general statements being apparently based on a small number of individual instances, where we have no idea of the signifi- cance of each one and where the speaker is often being reported by another person. In the end, then, we have an impressive collage of anecdotes, related with great wit but selected on what seem to be haphazard principles. The book bristles with suggestive turns of phrase, ideas of great significance are hinted at, but just as you begin to think about the implications, there is another story, another delightful country detour to follow. There are allusions to such impor- tant questions as the connections between power over nature and sexual power, generally masculine (pp. 39, 118-19, 146), the similarities between the treatment of children and animals (pp. 43, 150, 190); and the changing distinctions between nature and culture (pp. 15, 35, 90, 256).2 The omission of sustained analysis in the last case is particularly disappointing, for there is an extensive historical, anthropological, and general theoretical literature on the division to which Thomas does not, so far as I can discover, refer, nor does he define either term. There are many such lost opportunities in the book. We can use our experience of contemporary society to judge the validity of the arguments Man and the Natural World contains. We still talk to plants, we are still cruel to animals, we still abuse people through animal names (witness the force of the term "pig" when applied to the police). Vegetarians are still predicting that society will soon recognise meat eating as the barbarous prac- 2 See, for example, C.

All these are facets of human behaviour which Thomas noted in earlier centuries, many of them ones he thinks declined with the great revolution in human consciousness he charts. What kind of changes have gone on for so many of these ideas and behaviours to persist? It may be crude, but it is worth exploring the extent to which, for example, we continue to eat meat because the entire world economy is structured around the fact that we in the West do so while much of the rest of the world starves. We talk to plants because deep-seated beliefs persist in an animate, anthropomorphic universe. Animals can remain commodities, not despite our sentimentalising them, but because we do so. Contradictions between ideology and "life" remain: our ideas, in large measure, veil our material conditions in order to sustain dominant power structures. "Man" never left centre stage, nature has never been, and will never be, recognised as autonomous. This is not to deny that ways of thought about such things have changed, nor that they have changed in conjunction with all other social processes. There have been revolutions in thought, certainly, yet the dominance of "man" has remained unchecked-to explain this apparent paradox is to explain how both ideology and material life have changed to permit the present domination and expropri- ation of nature. But that is another story.</page></plain_text>
