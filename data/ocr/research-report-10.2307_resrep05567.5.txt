<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Warrior Politics—Pagan Ethos    Like humans, the European Union has great difficulty in freeing itself from  the Kantian illusion, mainly since it offers Brussels comfort and peace of  mind. The EU has become immune to disturbing truths, and still prefers  lovely daydreams over harsh, realist reality. The problem for the European  Union, and for Realism in particular, is that Europe (and the West in general)  is not confronted with a competing Great Power engaged in a classical poker- like game for influence and geostrategic supremacy. Yes, there is Russia,  which under Putin has picked itself up; and yes, there is China, which might  start throwing its considerable weight around. But if we agree that the main  security threat facing Europe is international terrorism, the challenge is  mainly asymmetrical warfare. This requires levels of versatility and  steadfastness in European policy that remain few and far between.   It is now becoming evident that the main challenge to the West is jihad, the  Islamic holy war against the West. This was again confirmed by US President  Bush’s statement at NATO’s Bucharest summit in April 2008: ‘The terrorist  threat is real, it is deadly, and defeating this enemy is the top priority of  NATO’.19 The al-Qaeda-led jihad stands for the violent struggle of a radical  Muslim community against infidel outsiders.20 As Andrew Bostom has                                                    19)  ‘President Bush Visits Bucharest, Romania, Discusses NATO’, White House press release   (2 April 2008), available online at    http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080402-2.html.  20)  Andrew Bostom (ed.), The Legacy of Jihad: Islamic Holy War and the Fate of Non-Muslims   (Amherst NY: Prometheus Books, 2005).   13 </page> <page sequence="2">  argued, the secret of success for the Arab camel nomads who started jihad  against the Byzantine Empire was based less on military superiority than on  the weakness and decadence of the powers that they overthrew. These  decadent empires centred on a sedentary culture, forgetful of the struggle for  existence and far detached from the warlike spirit of jihad, making them ripe  for conquest. The main question facing Europe today is whether history  repeats itself? Has Europe’s self-imposed meekness made it decadent,  unwilling to ‘look evil in the eye’, and unlike the United States unable to  reawaken the warrior spirit that has been suppressed by decades of European  integration?   This key question, which touches upon the ostensible division between  realism and morality, has been developed most provocatively in Robert D.  Kaplan’s book Warrior Politics.21 Kaplan suggests that important lessons can  still be learned from pre-Christian thinkers from antiquity such as  Thucydides, Cicero, Seneca and Sun Tzu, as well as their modern disciples  Clausewitz, Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. Realist scholars will find  themselves supported by Kaplan’s call to take these thinkers seriously, and  use their wisdom to enlighten the problems facing the twenty-first century.  Kaplan suggests that the post-industrial West seeks to deny conflict,  exercising self-denial based on the prevailing Judeo-Christian ethical code of  cooperation and compromise. Kaplan calls upon the West to cease its values  rhetoric and instead adopt a Realist strategy based on results, rather than on  good intentions. This is particularly relevant for the European Union, whose  civil libertarian impulses are of course salutary, but dangerous. As Kurt  Tucholski once argued: ‘Das Gegenteil von Gut ist nicht Böse, sondern gut  gemeint’ [in English: ‘the opposite of well done is not badly done, but well  meant’].   It is certainly true that the West has become wary of war, and has for the  very first time in history frowned upon military conquest and the concomitant  warrior spirit. Every culture has revered heroes—such as Odysseus, King  David, Muhammad, Aeneas and Genghis Khan—until now. Warrior heroes  now need a ‘license to kill’, but the population at large seems to assume that it  has transcended this kind of brutality; Genghis Khan has now been  superseded by Javier Solana. This rather smug disdain for war and warriors  reflects a mistaken view that modernity and the Enlightenment have not only  changed international politics, but human nature at large.    Together with Kaplan, Lee Harris suggests that jihadists are warriors of  the old school, and not just slightly more radical or retarded versions of  postmodern man.22 Harris suggests that the rise of democracy and reason are                                                    21)  Robert D.

Sageman argues that  14   </page> <page sequence="3">  because of rare historical circumstances, and not because of their superiority.  As a result, the survival of the Western societal model is not inevitable, but  always tenuous. Liberal societies will always have to live with war, or at least  acknowledge the spectre of war and be prepared to engage with it. Following  Kaplan’s ideas, Harris suggests that the liberal West may well be morally  superior to others, but its values are not as widely shared as it assumes, and  fragile to top. This raises the question of whether the West can embrace the  warrior mentality, which is inimical to the very basic beliefs of liberalism,  without destroying precisely what is being defended. In short, and focused on  Europe: can the European Union conduct a Realist foreign and security  policy, while maintaining its postmodern security community? Can the  European Union develop a strategic culture (à la Robert Cooper’s ‘liberal  imperialism’) that incorporates at least a semblance of this warrior spirit,  without the unravelling of its own post-national paradise?    Kaplan’s warrior spirit may be just another way of referring to the  Clausewitzian paradigm, underlying what is now often called a ‘strategic  culture’. As a strategic actor, the European Union starts off as a tabula rasa,  whose institutional record still has to be set. This is not only a discursive  process (based on words and discourse), but also a performative one (based  on actions and policies).23 In itself, this would hardly be new. As Erik  Ringmar argues (taking Sweden’s interventions during the Thirty Years’ War  as a case study), states can fight wars mainly to get recognition for a different  identity, to be taken ‘seriously’ as a Great Power, rather than for objective,  rational, Realist reasons of pre-established national interests.24 For the nation- state, this offers new, heroic narratives based on wars of national defence,  national liberation, and the customary glorification of the individuals who  sacrificed themselves out of loyalty to their Heimat, Motherland, or whatever  anthropomorphic characterization of territory is chosen.25 It will be difficult to  imagine a nation whose identity has not been (at least partially) framed by its  conflicts and wars.    The power envy of EU member states indicates that their national  identities remain sticky, and do not change easily, let alone often. But change  is possible, particularly during critical junctures that can be defined as  ‘perceived crisis situations occurring from complete policy failures, but also                                                                                                                       contrary to widespread assumptions, terrorists are not willing to sacrifice themselves   because they hate their target, but because of a positive reason, such as glory and   reputation.  23)  David Long, ‘The Security Discourses of the European Union: A Functional Critique’, in   Lucian M.

Obviously, war is such  a critical juncture, making it both necessary and easier for political elites to  promote different ideas about political order and the role of their own state in  a novel power constellation. War—won, lost or merely endured—often  confronts states with a new territorial reality (see the examples of Germany,  Britain and Russia), making a commensurate change in identity appear  reasonable, almost natural.    Europe’s identity as a (mainly) civilian power was severely dented by the  Balkan wars of the 1990s, and the Kosovo imbroglio in particular. The  informal institutional division of labour—whereby NATO fights, the EU  funds and the UN feeds—gnawed at Europe’s self-image as enlightened,  superior Kantians-with-a-mission: to enlarge their postmodern space for  others to benefit. But the European Union missed this unique and timely  chance to use (or abuse) ‘Kosovo’ as an alibi to stabilize the meaning of  ‘European security’ through military intervention. It was not the European  Union that intervened, but NATO. Or, more precisely, it was the United  States with its military superiority and ‘just do it!’ mentality that muscled in  and brought the internecine conflict to a halt.27 The Kosovo episode was  devastating to Europe’s continental dignity and pride. Europe—and the  European Union in particular—was humbled, even humiliated.    As the crow flies, Kosovo is a mere 100 miles from Italy, Greece and  Austria. As such an obvious part of geographical Europe, ending this conflict  was flatly on Europe’s policy plate. But while Europe’s historical ‘other’  resurfaced in Kosovo, the European Union experienced a déjà vu all over  again: impotent in the face of evil, long on rhetoric, short on political courage  and military power. For the European Union, ‘Kosovo’ embodied a critical                                                    26)  Martin Marcussen, Thomas Risse, Daniela Engelmann-Martin, Hans Joachim Knopf and   Klaus Roscher, ‘Constructing Europe?

This is the myth of Captain America, the Lone   Ranger and Superman, constructing the US as a redeemer nation. It is also an image that   tickles the egos of US foreign policy-makers. For example, when the influential German   weekly Der Spiegel created a cover featuring President George W. Bush as Rambo, Vice-  President Dick Cheney as The Terminator, Condoleezza Rice as Xena Warrior Princess,   and other officials as Batman and Conan the Barbarian, Washington did not express its   indignation; instead, the US ambassador to Germany ordered 33 poster-sized renditions of   the cover, which were sent back to the White House; see Der Spiegel (18 February 2002).

The ensuing European discourse on the  Balkans/Kosovo has reformulated the EU’s feebleness into a mythical ‘wake- up call’, sparking a jetzt erst recht mentality [in English: let’s go for it!] in the  face of its embarrassing military weakness vis-à-vis the United States. As  (then) NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson argued in 1999: ‘The  division of labour we saw in the Kosovo air campaign was militarily necessary,  but it is politically unsustainable in the longer term. The European Security  and Defence Identity is no longer just an attractive idea; it has become an  urgent necessity’.29    Trying to live up to this test, the European Union adopted its first-ever  Security Strategy at the December 2003 European Council.30 Echoing the US  strategy (and reflecting the impact of Cooper’s ‘liberal imperialist’ ideas on  European strategic thinking), the EU Security Strategy identifies WMD  proliferation as ‘potentially the greatest threat to our security’. And although  the European Union still maintains that ‘our security and prosperity  increasingly depend on an effective multilateral system’, it makes a few path- breaking statements: ‘With the new threats, the first line of defence will often  be abroad. The new threats are dynamic [...] left alone, terrorist networks will  become ever more dangerous’. It continues that: ‘[a]ctive policies are needed  to counter the new dynamic threats. We need to develop a strategic culture  that fosters early, rapid, and when necessary, robust intervention’. The  European Union also carefully copy-cats the United States’ judgement that  ‘the gravest danger to [our Nation] lies at the crossroads of radicalism and  technology’.31 Obviously, it is this concoction of premodern barbarity and  postmodern high-tech that poses the greatest threat to modernity’s  institutional framework.   But although the European Union’s Security Strategy (which is currently  under revision) takes an important step towards developing a European  strategic culture, the transatlantic division of labour still exists: the US adopts  a pagan ethos, whereas the EU turns the other cheek. This is best reflected in                                                    28)  Elizabeth Pond, ‘Kosovo: Catalyst For Europe’, The Washington Quarterly, vol. 22, no. 4   (autumn 1999).  29)  Speech by Lord Robertson, Annual Session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly,   Amsterdam (15 November 1999).  30)  ‘A Secure Europe in a Better World’, Brussels, no.
