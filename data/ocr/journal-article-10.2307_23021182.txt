<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chacel's "Balaam" as a Feminist Fable Carole A. Holdsworth Loyola University Chicago "But Balaam was stopped from his mad course when his donkey spoke to him with a human voice, scolding him and rebuking him." —II Peter 2:16 (TLB) Although Rosa Chacel (n. 1898) has stated in her 1989 collection of essays La lectura es secreto that "no me cuento entre las defensoras de los derechos femininos" (277), she can indeed be considered a feminist. I have chosen the story "Balaam," from Ofrenda a una virgen loca (1961), as a charming case in point.1 The tale, ninteen pages long in its Icada, Nevda, Diada reprinting, is in many ways a gloss of the well-known biblical story of the prophet Balaam, his talking she-ass, and the angel of the Lord (Numbers 22); it can be summarized as follows. Mauricio, an extremely bright boy, constantly entertains his male classmates (the school is segregated by gender) with his creative, but not at all malicious, pranks. Julia, an unpleasantly sly girl, enjoys terrorizing the younger or weaker girls. One rainy day, in the contiguous restrooms, Julia is tormenting the little Indian girl Chela with huge corn worms; on the other side of the partition, Mauricio is attempting to catch a cockroach so that he can pull off its back legs in order to mime more realistically the popular song "La Cucaracha." When he hears Chela's tiny voice repeating in terror "No, no, eso no!," Mauricio undergoes what Joan Borysenko has called "a soul-making</page><page sequence="2">204 Letras Femeninas, Volume XXII, Nos. 1-2 (1996) experience" (8), an intense "feminization" process which causes him to become almost instantly more compassionate, caring and empathic due to the shock of hearing what he assumes was the cockroach's little voice. In this article I shall analyze Chacel's presentation in "Balaam" of reverse sexual stereotypes, of what Josephine Donovan considers "the feminist idea" (xiii) of consciousness-raising, and of the pressing need for open communication with the Other. Chacel's feminism is genuine, although it transcends the narrowness of limiting fads or fanaticism, as Mauricio experiences the opening of a truly humanistic "salida hacia la luz" (203). At the conclusion of the brief second paragraph of "Balaam," there occurs the only direct statement involving the "yo" of the omniscient narrator, whose sex is never revealed: "Tratare de contar los hechos, aparentemente inconexos, uno por uno" (203). This prepares the reader for the rather fragmentary structure of the story, which passes from the boys' to the girls' groups until its climax in the restroom episode. (This separatist structure in itself gives emphasis to the gender-orientation of the narrative.) First of all, the narrator describes the two child principal characters, followed by a focus upon Julia and her harassment of little Chela; this is succeeded by a recounting of the exploits of Mauricio, in and out of school, including his miming of "La Cucaracha" to the delight of the customers of a neighborhood tavern. There follows a switch back to Mauricio's classroom, where his teacher decides to dictate to the restless group of boys the biblical story of Balaam; it is the raw power of this "historia ingenua y cruel" (209) over the entire class—but especially over Mauricio—which determines the denouement. Full of the strange suggestivity of the ancient tale of the talking she-ass and the angel whom only she at first can see, Mauricio's overhearing of Chela's anguished whisper "No, no, eso no!" becomes for him a miraculous occurrence. At the story's close, even the young (male) teacher to whom Mauricio finally confides his weird experience is willing to "suspend his disbelief': "—iY puede usted creerlo? ^Puede usted creer que hable una cucaracha?"—Mira, no se como decirte. .. .^La oiste? ^Estas seguro" ?—Si, senor, estoy bien seguro de que la of' (221). Chacel's conclusion has provided an excellent example of Todorov's statement that the fantastic is "that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an</page><page sequence="3">Holdsworth 205 apparently supernatural event" (25). More importantly for my purpose, however, the merging in the Spanish narrative's concluding section of the boy's experience with that of the girls' furnishes a clear structural illustration of what is for me one of the basic ideas which Chacel presents in "Balaam": a truly humanistic life must reveal a confluence of the male and female perspectives. As dona Rosa has written, "mi identificacion con la juventud actual es un fenomeno de maternidad . . . y de paternidad" ("Comentario a un libro historico" 233). While the form of "Balaam" is looser and more rambling than is the case in many of Chacel's stories, the characterization is masterful. The reader can quickly recognize the psychological truth of the principal characters as well as of the minor characters. Also, the presentation of the characters tellingly supports the ideas which the author seeks to convey. Let me begin not with Mauricio and Julia, but instead with the teachers who appear in the story. The girls' teacher, senorita Taboada, may strike the reader as an older woman, somewhat worn down by her work, somewhat lacking in awareness and in sensitivity. She never catches on that Julia is making life miserable for small Chela, and— when the bigger girl pulls Chela's hair during class—the teacher doesn't realize what is going on and embarrasses the Indian child by asking her, in front of all the other girls,"—^.Que tenes en la cabeza?" (205). A few lines later Ms. Taboada exclaims, "—jCon tanto pelo y tanto monito celeste!" (206), almost as if she resents Chela's one luxury, her beautifully abundant hair. All in all, the girls' teacher does not come across as a worthy female role model. (The "maestra de los chiquilines" [204], mentioned only once, spends her time as she walks to the rural Rio de la Plata region school asking herself with no little trepidation, "^,Que podra pasar hoy?" [204]. Her implied timidity and passivity, almost stereotypical feminine, eliminate her as well as a positive role model for the girls.) The male teacher, on the other hand, is an extremely likable and worthy pedagogue. Young and "lleno de vocacion," he recognizes mischievous Mauricio's intelligence and "queri'a entenderle" (206). When the boy returns to the classroom after his momentous visit to the restroom, the young teacher at once suspects that something has happened to upset him profoundly and manages later to pry the relation of the incident from the reluctant and bemused youth. "El maestro," therefore, is portrayed as compassionate, imaginative, and</page><page sequence="4">206 Letras Femeninas, Volume XXII, Nos. 1-2 (1996) understanding, truly interested in the youth's welfare. He definitely qualifies as a very positive role model, for both boys and girls. In a modified sense, the girls' teacher, who lacks sensitivity and compassion, and the boys' teacher, who is caring and enthusiastic, foreshadow the much more detailed presentation of reverse sexual stereotypes presented in the two children, Julia and Mauricio. In the paragraph which introduces the two child protagonists, the narrator remarks that they reveal "caracteristicas opuestas" (202). Julia is a "gorda sonolienta" (205), for whom the most apt adjective may well be "taimada" (used twice, 204 and 205). Her large size allows Julia to bully the smaller girls as a boy might do; Chela, her favorite victim, "no llegaba a sus dos tercios" and is often described with diminutives ("indiecita," "flaquita," 205). Julia's use of the gross choclo worms to terrorize Chela is also something a boy might do, while the Indian child's reaction is "typically feminine": "quedaba paralizada de asco" (210). The scene in the girls' restroom is strikingly narrated in phrases which suggest a rape: "[Julia] tiraba del cuello del vestido hacia abajo . . . dejandose caer sobre ella . . . [s]ugetaba a Chela con las piernas, y con los ojos la aterrorizaba" (212). Yet Julia, obnoxious child though she is, is not completely antipathetic, at least to me. In contrast to the weak Chela, who flees to the restroom because the classroom is full of tremendous difficulties and who experiences a "dolor delicioso" as she urinates (211), Julia impresses by her energy and wit. In Chacel's novel Teresa (1941), the narrator describes "mistress Langridge" as follows: "EI hombre, ansiado y envidiado a un tiempo, lati'a en ella como en posesion demoni'aca" (53), while the protagonist (Espronceda's lover)— according to the character Laura—reveals "un alma . . . brava, varonil" (164). Julia's failure is, of course, her expenditure of vital energy and intelligence to torment the weak. The hyperactive Mauricio impresses me as a most true-to-life character from his first introduction in the story. He is the bright boy who functions as class clown and class catalyst, largely from boredom; the narrator is careful to have the young teacher reflect that Mauricio's conduct never springs from "condiciones verdaderamente perversas" (206). There is in the child "un poder de comunicacion poco frecuente, irresistible" (207), which captivates all who know him.</page><page sequence="5">Holdsworth 207 When, in the restroom, Mauricio overhears Chela's frantic plea to Julia and attributes it to the cockroach, he becomes furious with himself and, unfairly, with the man in the tavern who plays "La Cucaracha" on the guitar, at whom he throws mud and thus causes his teacher to seize the opportunity to force the "truth" from him; as the boy tells his teacher, "lo que yo iba a hacer [pull off the cockroach's back legs) era muy malo" (218). It is as if the youth has had a glimpse into the oneness of the universe, the sacredness of life, and the true connectedness of all living things. He displays an almost "feminine" concern for a small, terrified creature—completely the reverse of Julia's cruelty to Chela and her bland indifference to the huge worms which are for the girl only a negligible means to an unworthy end. Silvia Mangini has written that "Chacel logra que sus personajes maculinos tengan una sensibilidad feminina" (54), a remark of which Mauricio seems to me to be an excellent illustration. Julia, on the other hand, illustrates qualities traditionally considered as "masculine": daring, energy, the use of force to terrorize and subdue. The entomological epiphany which Mauricio experiences in the unlikely setting of a school restroom has been brought about by what he believes a supernatural moment of consciousness-raising. Essential in the architecture of this moment are the two well observed insects involved, Julia's bloated worm (an excellent phallic symbol) and the lively little cockroach, "gorda y negra, bien brillosa" (220).2 The worm is Julia's weapon merely to inflict terror, but the cockroach is presented in almost anthropomorphic terms. Even before he hears the whispered words "No, no, eso no!," Mauricio has had a "close encounter" with the creature, described—like Chela—with diminu tives: "alii estaba subidita, mirandome. Y movia los cuernecitos de un lado para otro" (220). There has seemingly occurred a moment of true communication between boy and lowly insect, that most other of Others. It is interesting that a somewhat similar scene takes place in Teresa, when the child heroine encounters a lizard in the garden: "levanto la cabecita hacia ella y la miro a los ojos ... en aquel rato . .. se habia contado todo" (43). One can not help wondering if there could be an autobiographical echo, so common in Chacel's writings, in these two passages. In any case, both incidents serve to illustrate Chacel's statement that "No hay nada mas dificil que entender lo que otro quiere decirnos. . . . Con frecuencia—y con desesperacion y con terror—sospechamos que no nos entenderan" ("Figuraciones" 261).</page><page sequence="6">208 Letras Femeninas, Volume XXII, Nos. 1-2 (1996) The "desesperacion y terror" of the cockroach culminate in Mauricio's mind with his hearing of "una vocecita ... [Era como una bebita que fuera a echarse a llorar!" (221) Ana Rodriguez has commented that in all the narratives which appear in Icada, Nevda, Diada, we find "el misterio entrelazado a la vida. Y en cada una, siempre, la palabra como instancia esencial" (166).3 Like the talking she-ass in communication with the Divine in the biblical story of Balaam, the supposedly talking cockroach allows the obfuscated Mauricio to have a glimpse of God's angel, here an abstract angel symbolizing compassion for the weak, sensitivity to the Other. On one level, Chacel's "Balaam" is a delightfully realistic tale of schoolchildren and their frantic efforts to break the long day's monotony: "jQue pase algo!, es la peticion que todos llevan en la mente" (203). On another, symbolic, level—and there is a powerful symbolic element in all of Rosa Chacel's work—this apparently simple little story lends itself nicely to a feminist interpretation. The cockroach represents for me the "despised and rejected" Other, the Other who finally finds a "voice of her own" to protest against her unwilling role as victim of aggression and subjugation: "Una forma, para quien es un simbolista, ahorra muchas palabras," Chacel wrote in La confesion (12).4 The "cockroach" certainly does not speak "many words," but the four that she utters are quite enough to change Mauricio into "otro chico" ("no es el mismo chico," reflects the teacher [215].)' The feminization of Mauricio is, I contend, the direct result of the boy's encounter with the insect. For Carolyn Heilbrun and Catharine Stimpson, "The masculine avoidance of what we have come to call the feminine experience seems ... far more destructive to our world today [than] the feminine avoidance of what we have come to call the masculine experience, because violence and the love of action is [sic] learned more easily than either awareness or love" (72). "Balaam," according to my interpretation, offers the reader not only a situation developed from the feminine contact with, not avoidance of, the "masculine experience" of "violence and the love of action" (Julia's attempts to terrorize Chela), but also—and much more importantly— a situation developed from the masculine contact with, not avoidance of, the "feminine experience" of "awareness or love" (Mauricio's moving encounter with the cockroach). Far from denigrating either the masculine or the feminine experience, Chacel seems to me be championing the combination of</page><page sequence="7">Holdsworth 209 both types of experience, but not in an androgynous sense. After all, even following the restroom incident, Mauricio throws mud at the guitarist in the tavern, like a boy Saint George defending the maiden from the dragon. Unlike Julia, who betrays her sex through her tormenting of another girl, and unlike Chela, who almost seems to enjoy her stagnation in the role of passive victim, Mauricio manages to combine courage and activity with sensitivity and compassion. He thus qualifies as an excellent role model for both males and females, a model of humanistic behavior. According to Annie Leclerc, in Parole de femme, "L'Homme est grand, mais attention, les hommes ne sont que des hommes!" (21) A man—or boy, in Mauricio's case—can become more than a man, can become a true human being when his nature is enriched by the "feminine" virtues of compassion, sensitivity, and empathy. The feminism of Rosa Chacel, while neither militant nor radical, is deeply felt and expressed with courage and conviction; she would, I am sure, agree with the Costa Rican writer Carmen Naranjo that "the feminist struggle is to improve the human condition" [my italics] (Arizpe, "Interview" 101). " 'Balaam the son of Beor is the man Whose eyes are open! He hears the words of God. And has knowledge from the Most High. . . " —Numbers 24: 15-17 (TLB) NOTES 1 A shorter version of this study was presented at the IV Asamblea de la Asociacion de Literatura Feminina Hispdnica (Chicago), on October 23, 1993. 2 El gusano and la cucaracha—it is tempting to speculate upon the possible correlation between the grammatical gender of these words and the temperaments of the two children; Julia's conduct is more like a boy's, Mauricio's sensitivity more like a girl's. 3 My article "Chacel's Myth of the Vivipaous Zero" (Revista Monografica 8 [1992]: 7-78) deals in part with the magical power of the word. 41 cannot help wondering if the cockroach of Carmen Martin Gaite's El cuarto de atras (1980 has any literary parentesco with Chacel's "talking" cockroach.</page><page sequence="8">Letras Femeninas, Volume XXII, Nos. 1-2 (1996) 5 Carol Gilligan's important feminist study In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development (1982) also characterizes women as more compassionate, caring, sensitive, and empathic.
