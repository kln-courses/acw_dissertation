<plain_text><page sequence="1">NANDITA BATRA Dominion, Empathy, and Symbiosis Gender and Anthropocentrism in Romanticism Animals have arguably been the oldest metaphor used to define hu- manity, to construct human identities by symbolizing what humans are and are not. Appropriated for whichever rhetoric they serve, they occupy a Procrustean bed of order and disorder, innocence and depravity, violence and peacefulness, masculinity and femininity, monarchy and democracy, wisdom and ignorance, as well as sacri- fice, sexuality (both innocent and depraved), gluttony, drunkenness, and other seemingly disparate qualities. Mary Midgley, for instance, has drawn attention to the contradiction contained in the disparate uses of the very terms animal and beast , the former of which can en- compass a wide range of connotations from "spiritual" to "bestial" (Midgley, 36-37). These contradictions have been attributed by Tim Ingold to "our propensity to switch back and forth between two quite different approaches to the definition of animality : as a domain of the 'animal kingdom' including humans, and as a state of condi- tion, opposed to humanity" (Ingold, 4). Contradiction therefore per- vades the entire discourse of zoology, from purportedly objective scientific texts to more openly subjective representations of animals in imaginative literature and art. The animal in art has been consid- ered so entirely rhetorical that its role is sometimes explained away as an incidental shell (Bettelheim, 75, 177) whose kernel is the "cul-</page><page sequence="2">102 ISLE turai values, relationships, and problems of human society" (Tap- per, 57). Insofar as romanticism is a coherent movement, animals are cen- tral to its holistic symbolism and a prominent feature of its art. This centrality notwithstanding, the romantic animal is delineated as the Other and, like all human representations of animals, is toggled be- tween alterity and identity in the process of human self-definition (both masculine and feminine). This ambivalence and alternation may be traced to the conceptual discrepancy toward the superiority of Man (not Woman) over other beings that has been inherited by mainstream Western thought through its two major tributaries, Greece1 and Judeo-Christianity.2 These discrepancies can be seen pervading not only art and literature but religion, scientific taxon- omy, and even the law.3 The most influential modern reinforcement of the dualist position came, of course, from Descartes, whose 1637 Discours de la méthode contained the notorious bêtemachine theory that animals were mere bodies, no more than automata. Both human and animal bodies could be considered automata, but speech and the soul separated the human from the animal. The animal body operated purely on me- chanical principles, and any sounds made by the animal - including its cries of pain - were the products of its machinery. At the time of Descartes's death in 1650, no country in Europe had a law granting animals any rights, an absence that would remain unchanged for more than a century (Maehle, 95). Violent sports, such as hunting for the upper classes and cock- and dog-fighting, bull- baiting, and bull-running for the lower, were widely practiced (Mal- colmson, 49-50). Country fairs often featured performers who en- tertained spectators by eating live animals (such as cats and foxes), as well as activities like "goose-pulling" and "sparrow-mumbling," entailing competitions to pull of the head of the live creature con- cerned (E. S. Turner, 61-62). But the thought of late eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century England, the intellectual period that has been constructed as "romantic," can be considered to be a turning point for the way in which animals - and the human-animal relation- ship - were viewed in Europe. This revolution was part of a shared discourse that was manifested at the scientific, the philosophical, the literary, and the practical levels, as well as at the parliamentary level in England. Before the so-called Enlightenment, taxonomie systems had been</page><page sequence="3">Dominion, Empathy ; and Symbiosis 103 purely emblematic or anthropocentric, with little distinction made between real and mythical animals. Pliny's first-century Natural His- tory freely mixed folk tradition with observation, elephants with dragons, and moral evaluation with empiric observation. Even a mil- lennium and a half later, purportedly scientific taxonomies were based on subjective categories, such as edible/inedible, wild/tame, useful/useless, and even "sweet/foul smelling." Richard Brookes's Natural History of Quadrupeds (1763) concluded that the obvious divi- sion of animals was into "the Domestic and the Savage." The Lin- naen system ( Systema Naturae [1735]), accepted in England from the 1760s, reflected the Enlightenment and was the first taxonomy that seemed to base itself on objective criteria rather than mere anthro- pocentrism. Linnaeus's system was based upon establishing distinct categories to classify each animal as well as to ascertain its relative place within the natural order, and to the horror of many he firmly grouped Homo sapiens with other mammalian species, and specifi- cally with other primates under the order Anthro morpha. Devising a binomial system of nomenclature, Linnaeus used one Latin (or La- tinized) word to represent the genus and a second to distinguish the species. Although he was not wholly convinced about the fixity of the genera, he was about the species, and his influence is based on his atemporal stance. Within a few decades, however, the fixity of the Linnaen mode of classification would be superseded by modes in which the immutability of species was no longer a given. Well be- fore the turn of the century, Erasmus Darwin's Zoonomia (1794-1796) had appeared, and by 1800 Jean Baptiste de Monet (the Chevalier de Lamarck) had proclaimed his earliest public statement of his own theories of evolution (or "transformism") in his lecture "Système des animaux sans vertèbres" (Lecture on the Systems of Invertebrate Animals). Both men had arrived at their conclusions independently and had anticipated a theory of evolution but were unable to estab- lish how exactly evolution took place. Erasmus Darwin, basing his conclusions on vestigial organs and the metamorphoses of animals during development, deduced that transmutation of the species took place through the satisfaction of desires and needs, while Lamarck based his theories of transformism on his belief in the inheritance of acquired characters. Lamarck's theories were further developed in Philosophie zoologique (1809) and Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres (1815-1822), which emphasized the harmonious organi- cism of the environment through the active role it played in trans-</page><page sequence="4">104 ISLE formism - a far cry from the struggle for survival that was to be the hallmark of Charles Darwin's natural selection. Despite the dominant trends of Enlightenment objectivity and Cartesianism, there lingered a strong current that ran counter to both modes of thought. Although Linnaeus's method of classification was widely accepted by the mid-eighteenth century, objectivity clearly vied with unconcealed anthropocentrism until well into the nine- teenth century. Even Linnaeus had included orders such as "beasts of burden" ( iumenta ) in his taxonomy. Buffon, on the other hand, was more undisguisedly subjective, and he dismissed objectivity as a goal, following relationships rather than essences: the most "natural" way to classify an animal therefore became its relationship to man. Likewise, Cartesian dualism appeared on the surface to reign supreme, but several philosophers throughout Europe had been un- convinced by Descartes. In France both Voltaire and Diderot had been skeptical of the bêtemachine theory (Voltaire providing proof of animal intelligence in his article on animals in Dictionaire philoso- phique ), while in England John Locke ridiculed Descartes's theory, stating that scientists believed it "only because their work required it." Mande ville, himself a vegetarian, called Descartes a "vain rea- soner" in his "Fable of the Bees." By the 1760s some philosophers had begun to concede the possibility of human-animal continuity by accepting the concept of animal "sagacity" (intelligence). The Scot- tish philosopher David Hume acknowledged that animals had the power of "experimental reasoning," while England's David Hartley attributed the human disbelief in animal rationality to human igno- rance of animal communication (Thomas, 125). Long-lasting and far-reaching though the philosophers' impact might have been, a more immediate influence on the thought of eighteenth-century England was produced by some men of religion who attempted to dissociate Christianity from exploitative domin- ion over animals. Among these were Humphry Primatt, whose 1776 Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals la- beled cruelty toward animals a heresy and a sin, drawing attention to the elevated status given to animals in other religions. Likewise James Granger's 1772 sermon Apology for the Brute Creation or Abuse of Animals Censured had attempted to link kindness to animals with Christianity and to warn that cruelty to animals would lead to cru- elty to humans - a claim that is still the subject of debate today (Felt- house and Kellert, 710-17). Both tried to focus attention on biblical</page><page sequence="5">Dominion, Empathy ; and Symbiosis 105 passages in Exodus (20:10, 23:12) and Deuteronomy (5:14, 22:6-7, 25: 4) 4 and especially Proverbs 12:10 ("A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast"), and away from Genesis 1:26-28 and 9:2-3, the two passages that had been used to deny accountability toward animals.5 Meanwhile, vegetarianism was acquiring many ardent advocates who decreed that meat-eating should be avoided on several grounds: its cruelty, its unnaturalness, its repulsiveness, and its potential to produce bad breath. John Oswald, a Scottish officer stationed in In- dia, was sufficiently influenced by the teachings of Hinduism to give up meat and persuade others to do likewise in The Cry of Nature, or an Appeal to mercy and Justice on behalf of persecuted animals (1791). Joseph Ritson's Essay on Abstinence from Animal Food As A Moral Duty (1802) had a profound influence on Shelley, who in turn urged against animal slaughter in Vindication of Natural Diet and Essay on the Veg- etable System of Diet. Meat was almost England's national symbol, but by the middle of the eighteenth century vegetarianism in one form or another, though certainly not widespread, was no longer an un- known habit for the English. Its converts had included Aphra Behn, Lord Chesterfield, and James Boswell, as well as its more vocal advo- cates. Likewise, the traditional habit of serving, at the dining table, smaller animals with their heads attached gradually ceased to be seen as aesthetically enhancing and slowly all but disappeared (Thomas, 287-300). Before 1800 the law had occasionally punished "wanton, inten- tioned, or malicious" cruelty to animals (for acts like tearing out the tongues of live animals that were someone else's property), but only on account of the animals' role as human property; animals had no legal protection in their own right. When Sir William Pultney pre- sented to the House of Commons the first bill seeking this protection in 1800, the concept was considered ludicrous by Parliament and the press. Intended to prohibit the baiting of bulls, the bill was opposed by William Windham (who was then the secretary of war and an ar- dent defender of bull-baiting), losing by 43 votes to 41. (The issue, opined The Times editorial of 25 April 1800, was tyranny and be- neath the dignity of Parliament: "whatever meddles with the private personal disposition of a man's time or property is tyranny direct.") This did not deter Lord Erskine of Restormel, a former lord chancel- lor, from attempting (albeit unsuccessfully) in 1809 to persuade Par- liament to accept a bill, entitled "Preventing Wanton and Malicious</page><page sequence="6">106 ISLE Cruelty to Animals," which would establish the principle of animals' legal rights (Erskine, cols. 553-71). He was joined in these endeavors by Richard Martin (later the MP for Galway, and popularly known as "Humanity Dick" for the nickname given him by George IV). De- spite a number of initial failures, Martin succeeded in establishing Europe's first law against cruelty to animals in the 1822 act to "pre- vent cruel and improper treatment of Cattle," which was followed by the 1835 Cruelty to Animals Act outlawing animal-baiting sports, and then the 1849 act "for the more effectual Prevention of Cruelty to Animals." Some of this feeling culminated in the foundation in 1824 of the So- ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). With Princess (soon to be queen) Victoria as one of its patrons, it could add Royal to its name, becoming, in 1840, the RSPCA, and it became a major force in the policing of the laws that had gone into effect and in spreading the movement of animal welfare to France, Germany, and other Eu- ropean countries (Brown, 24). All attempts at benevolence toward animals were not fostered by an acknowledgment of the human-beast continuity, and often stemmed instead from two countervailing forms of anthropocen- trism. The first was that cruelty toward animals would eventually lead to cruelty toward humans, as Hogarth illustrated through the lesson of Tom Nero in the engravings entitled The Four Stages of Cru- elty. Tom Nero, who begins as a juvenile animal-torturer and devel- ops into a murderer, is eventually hanged and dissected. The second was that animals were indeed inferior creatures and were therefore worthy of protection and kindness. As Thomas notes, "The paradox, therefore, was that it was out of the very contradictions of the old an- thropocentric tradition that a new attitude would emerge" (Thomas, 156). For David Hartley the human was to the animal what God was to the human: a guardian with inherent duties and responsibilities; for Jeremy Bentham the question to be asked was neither "Can they reason ? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer ?" (Bentham, 412). Literary romanticism not only reflected but actively produced the changes of time, and the poets who later became known as the ro- mantic poets frequently made public and poetic statements about animals that reflected the influence of pantheistic doctrines on their thought. These statements produced enduring effects - both active and contemplative - on public opinion, frequently being cited by the pamphleteers and even quoted in speeches in Parliament. Blake's</page><page sequence="7">Dominion, Empathy , and Symbiosis 107 lines "A robin redbreast in a cage / Puts all heaven in a rage" be- came a slogan linking human and animal freedom, while in "The Lamb" and "The Tyger" he deconstructed the anthropomorphic view of these two animals. "A Fly" highlighted the human-animal continuum: Am not I A fly like thee? Or art thou not A man like me? For I dance And drink and sing Till some blind hand Shall brush my wing. Robert Burns went even further than Blake in apostrophizing not only the humble "fellow-mortal" mouse but the decidedly unro- mantic louse as well. Cowper's The Task declared that its speaker would banish from his "list of friends . . . the man / Who needlessly sets his foot upon a worm." Wordsworth's poems abound in the lessons taught to him by the animal world. "Hart-Leap Well" empa- thetically recreates the terror of a hart during a chase, exhorting the reader of 1800 "never to blend our pleasure or our pride / With sor- row of the meanest thing that feels." Coleridge's "Rime of the An- cient Mariner" (1798) explores the guilt produced by the wanton killing of an albatross, while the eponymous hero of his poem "To a Young Ass" receives the salutation "I hail thee Brother Percy Shel- ley's A Vindication of Natural Diet (1813) and Essay on the Vegetable System of Diet linked animal slaughter with disease and crime, which flow from unnatural diet: since meat can only be gained vio- lently, its consumption would inevitably produce violence. Angling, according to Byron, was not only the cruelest but also the stupidest sport. Keats characterized his own poetic ability as the "camelion" (chameleon) power of empathy that enabled the poet to enter the be- ing of other creatures: "if a Sparrow come before my Window I take part in its existince [sic] and pick about the Gravel" (Keats, 186). Blake, William Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Percy Shelley, and Keats compose the Big Six who have exclusively dominated the canon of romanticism for more than a century and a half, supposedly be-</page><page sequence="8">108 ISLE cause there "were no women" writing at the time and because their work was far from trivial or insignificant: it was certainly widely read and widely sold. These explorations have shown that far from being the monolithic movement it was once considered, the literature of this period encompasses several romanticisms, including what Anne Mellor has termed a "masculine" romanticism and a "feminine" one (Mellor 1993, 3~4),6 and that the exclusion of women from the ro- mantic canon has been based on the privileging of the masculine. This exclusion appears to be in danger of infiltrating the nascent canon of green literature. Anthologies of literature promoting green issues or humaneness to animals seldom exclude detailed excerpts from the Big Six. Mary Shelley has gradually entered both canons, but unfortunately little if any mention is made of the less canonical women writers of this period, such as Anna Barbauld, Sarah Trim- mer, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Mary Wollstonecraft, who antici- pated many of the axioms of ecofeminism.7 These women used the pen (perhaps in less prestigious genres than the men) to inculcate moral awareness rather than abstract speculation, frequently cham- pioning creatures like caterpillars and spiders for humane treatment, unlike the male poets whose causes tended to be "cuter," more an- thropomorphous animals.8 Emphasizing rationality rather than mys- ticism as the foundation of benevolent compassion, they had a lasting effect on middle-class morals. Some incited the wrath of established writers like Charles Lamb and Coleridge for their desire to ban nurs- ery rhymes and fairy tales that promoted cruel irrationality or cruel behaviour, such as the Mother Goose nursery rhymes that taught children "heartless fancies in which the cow with the crumpled horn tossed the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt ... of cats down the well, of mice docked by carving knives, blackbirds baked in pies" (E. S. Turner, 76). The best known of these women was probably Anna Letitia Bar- bauld (1743-1825), who was in fact one of the most popular living poets at the end of the eighteenth century. In addition to her poetry and her well-known political pamphlets against slavery, she wrote fables and verses for children. Her Hymns in Prose for Children in- structs children to think of the world of animals as the manifestation of God but also to see in the animal kingdom exemplars of order and hierarchy. The poem "The Mouse's Petition" was prompted by a visit to Joseph Priestley's house and the sight of a caged mouse destined for a respiratory experiment with brewery gases. It is an ironic re-</page><page sequence="9">Dominion, Empathy , and Symbiosis 109 minder to Priestley that Unitarianism (which Priestley founded) is "a resurgence of Stoic and early Platonic views of God as pervading mind" (Wordsworth and Hebron, 15). Positing the possibility of a pantheistic link between humanity and the animal world, the poem through the use of its animal speaker simultaneously emphasizes pantheism and the need for anthropocentric compassion: The well-taught philosophic mind To all compassion gives; Casts round the world an equal eye And feels for all that lives. If mind, as ancient sages taught, A never dying flame, Still shifts thro' matter's varying forms, In every form the same, Beware, lest in the worm you crush A brother's soul you find; And tremble lest thy luckless hand Dislodge a kindred mind Or, if this transient gleam of day Be all of life we share, Let pity plead within thy breast That little all to spare. The "petition" (spoken by the mouse) was attached to its cage. It had its desired effect, and the mouse was soon released (E. S. Turner, 78). Her other animal poems include some stock apostrophes to the dog and skylark, as well as the romanticized "India" and "Animals, and their Countries," which are catalogs of the animals of the colonies. Despite the exoticism they obviously exploit, they create a sense of wonder without the suggestion of either human, masculine, or Eu- ropean dominion that such descriptions usually entailed. Barbauld's subtle use of shifting perspective is highlighted in "The Caterpillar." "No helpless thing, I cannot harm thee now," is the opening line of its female speaker, who then proceeds to detail with photographic accuracy the beauty of the creature, "the silver line that streaks [its] back / The azure and the orange that divide / [Its] velvet</page><page sequence="10">110 ISLE sides." But it is not because of the creature's beauty or its helpless- ness alone that the speaker refrains from killing it, for she acknowl- edges having taken part in the "slaughter" of other creatures, having "crushed whole families beneath [her] foot." The anthropomorphism of her reason might seem trite were it not infused with her refusal to attach moral superiority to her own act of seeming mercy, her ability to recognize the occasional egocentrism of altruism without denying the validity that that altruism possesses. She compares her act of saving the one caterpillar to the act of a triumphant victor who sa- vors the "roar of canon and the clang of arms," and has no "soft re- lentings" for "the work of death and carnage." Yet when he sees A single sufferer from the field escaped, Lift his imploring eyes, - the hero weeps; He is grown human, and capricious Pity, Which would not stir for thousands, melts for one With sympathy spontaneous: The unflinching recognition of the sentimentalism and anthropomor- phism of this capricious act, which is "not Virtue" but the "weak- ness of a virtuous mind," is characteristic of the combination of com- passion and rationality that appears in Barbauld's work. Sarah Trimmer (1741-1810), on the other hand, adopted a more firmly anthropocentric and moralistic position in advising children to learn compassion for animals but not the "contrary fault of im- moderate tenderness When her Fabulous Histories Designed for the In- struction of Children Respecting Their Treatment of Animals was written (1786), the keeping of pets had only recently become fashionable, and the Histories were originally conceived as a series of animal fables and often reprinted under the title The History of the Robins. Each in- cident is designed to teach the children Harriet and Frederick Ben- son (and their contemporaries) enlightened attitudes toward ani- mals, as well as to give them the robins' perspective of humankind. Their mother's determination to teach them kindness does not alter her conviction that "we should prefer the happiness of mankind to that of any animal whatever." She regrets "that so many lives should be sacrificed to preserve ours; but we must eat animals or they would at length eat us, at least all that would otherwise support us." Nor does she question the dictum that animals must give "us" their bod- ies because they have nothing else to give; they have "been expressly</page><page sequence="11">Dominion, Empathy ; and Symbiosis 111 destined by the Supreme Governor as food for mankind/' and by giving their wool and milk some animals are permitted to "return their obligation to us." Interspersed with the children's adventures is the story of a family of robins - named Robin, Dicky, Flapsy, and Pecksy - whose parents try to teach them the humanized virtues of self-sacrifice and obedience. Trimmer's stories also include the themes of hunting and other blood sports. Through the mother char- acter - who is invariably Trimmer's own mouthpiece - Charlotte and Henry of An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature are guided to think of "the poor little frightened creature" and its suffering. Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) modelled her Original Stories from Real Life with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness (1788) on Sarah Trimmer's work. Mrs. Mason, who narrates the stories, clearly receives Wollstone- craft's endorsement as a model of exemplary thinking, and is gov- erness and spiritual guide to Mary and Caroline, two rich girls. Her love of animals extends to snails, caterpillars, and spiders, which she allows to crawl onto her hand, emphasizing the fact that annoyance and disgust cannot be grounds for killing: "You are often trouble- some - I am stronger than you - yet I do not kill you." She raises several issues that are still unsolved in animal rights discourse to- day, such as animal euthanasia and the slaughter of vermin and ani- mal "pests." Although her compassion and anthropocentrism are not in conflict with each other ("Be tender-hearted ... it is only to an- imals that children can do good. Men are their superiors."), she even raises the issue of animal communication and language: "dumb they appear to those who do not observe their looks and gestures; but God, who takes care of every thing, understands their language; and so did Caroline this morning." While she does not endorse the slaugh- ter of "pests," her position toward euthanasia leans in favor of being cruel to be kind: upon seeing two birds injured from a gun fired by an obnoxious boy, she instructs Mary and Caroline to take up one of them so that she may bind the wing together in the hope of healing it; but she believes that to permit the other bird to "die by inches" would be simply "selfishness or weakness," and saying this "she put her foot on the bird's head, turning her own another way." This period was hardly the first time that animal stories and fables had been used to instruct either adults or children, but we see the dic- tum that the animal is incidental to the animal tale dismantled by</page><page sequence="12">112 ISLE these women writers, who actually use the animal fable to teach about animals, even though their ultimate goal might be greater humanity. Although a well-known writer in her own right, Wollstonecrafťs reputation was both highlighted and obscured by that of her famous (or infamous) family, as was also the case with Mary Lamb (1764- 1847) aRd Dorothy Wordsworth (1771-1855). Mary Lamb's "The Rook and the Sparrows" illustrates the frequent human denial of the malevolence of the natural world and the resulting anthropomorphic tendency to valorize "cute" animals above others. She describes a little boy who feeds a hungry sparrow with crumbs of bread but withdraws this "kind bounty" when he observes a great blackbird taking away the smaller bird's "share." The speaker wishes she could have told the child that "rooks live by food / In the same way that sparrows do," and that "Birds act by instinct, and ne'er can / Attain the rectitude of man." Dorothy Wordsworth, like Mary Lamb, was a prolific writer whose reputation was overshadowed by her brother; her journals often reveal observations that were appropriated by William for his own poetic purposes. Her work is permeated with observations of the animals that occupied her quotidian routine, and in many ways she may be seen as the most representative romantic woman writer, a writer whose contribution to romanticism is most fully illustrated by comparison with her brother's. Neither William nor Dorothy constructs a Nature red in tooth in claw. William presents almost exclusively a rosy picture of animals, and unlike the women or the other members of the Big Six, he shows animals only in conflict with humans. Dorothy does not dwell on the malevolence of nature either but shows its potential destructiveness curbed and softened by nurture and care. William's animals are usu- ally diminutive and seldom described in minute detail. "White as milk," or "white as snow," are the most visual descriptors of animals that he employs, unlike Dorothy's photographic recreation of the "sheep bleating &amp; in lines &amp; chains &amp; patterns scattered over the mountains," or the crows that "become white as silver as they flew in the sunshine," then becoming like "shapes of water passing over the green fields" as they gain distance. For William, animals are dis- tinctly "inferior kinds" and therefore they are worthy of compassion. Animal nature is something to be incorporated but transcended, as is female nature. Keith Tester's observation that animal rights are usu- ally extended only to "nice, cuddly mammals," ones that are easy to</page><page sequence="13">Dominion, Empathy, and Symbiosis 113 anthropomorphize (Tester, 16) might well be applied to William. The few nonmammals that are idealized in his poems are visually appealing birds or butterflies.9 For Dorothy, the hierarchy between humans and animals might be implicitly intimated through the theme of nurture that runs through her work, but the symbiosis that accompanies this nurture undermines the hierarchy. A comparison of Dorothy's "Mary Jones and her Pet-lamb" and William's "The Pet-Lamb" will focus some of these differences.10 One of Dorothy's only narratives, "Mary Jones" tells the story of a little girl who cares for a young lamb brought home by her father (antici- pating by thirty-odd years the nursery rhyme "Mary Had a Little Lamb"). The lamb's mother has died; it tries to run away, but Mary is able to rescue her pet and is in turn rescued by her parents. William's poem "The Pet-Lamb" focuses on a similar incident: little Barbara Lewthwaite also cares for a lamb brought home by her father. Both Dorothy and William use the lamb to construct a human iden- tity. For Dorothy, the identity is created through Mary's bonding with the lamb. The lamb tries to run back into the hills where it was born, but Mary asserts her human control of the lamb not through the power of human language but through nurture, protectiveness, and mothering. Nature thus becomes domesticated through feminine symbiosis rather than masculine dominion, its potential violence withheld and subsumed in the harmony between humans and ani- mals: just as the humans vow never to take a knife to the lamb, the bees never sting Mary or the lamb and become a feature of the land- scape. As Levin points out, they "hover over, perhaps guarding, her lamb's final resting place" (Levin, 58). Dorothy's barely noticeable narrator explores the parrallelisms between the family community of the humans, the symbiotic relationship between Mary and her pet animal, and the gentle domestication of Nature without confirming or denying the hierarchy that these parrallelisms constitute. For William, however, the lamb serves as a launching pad to ex- plore the distinctness between the world of nature and the world of human (male) consciousness. Like Blake before him (who rhetori- cally asked, "Little lamb who made thee? . . . Gave thee life and bid thee feed?"), William cannot see the lamb without imposing a teleo- logical structure on its role in the universe, using it to speculate on the relationships between creation, literary creation, and the limits of language. William's focus on the narrator contrasts sharply with</page><page sequence="14">114 ISLE Dorothy's evasion of self. The "I," the hallmark of masculine roman- ticism, is seldom present in the work of the female romantics and is virtually absent in Dorothy's work. "She could not, would not ana- lyze," claimed Elizabeth Hardwick, demonstrating the absence of contemplation that has been considered her strength as well as her weakness (Hardwick, 163). The triangle in Dorothy's story is the girl, lamb, and parents, who all work symbiotically: girl rescues lamb, lamb tries to provide warmth for girl, parents rescue both. In contrast William's triangle is composed of lamb, girl, and narrator. William's intrusive narrator keeps trying to imagine what Barbara is saying, unable to see the lamb except in anthropocentric terms (and Barbara except in andro- centric terms). William's pantheistic musings in fact highlight the difference between man and animal. Animal and human identities are interwoven, but with distinct divisions among the three (narra- tor, girl, and lamb), with the clearly male narrator distanced from both girl and lamb. This distancing recalls the distancing of animal and female nature in the identity constructed by William in "Tintern Abbey," in which the narrator wistfully recalls, but believes to have transcended, the "coarser pleasures" and "animal movements" of his youth, when he "bounded o'er the mountains" as spontaneously as a roe, animal joys that he links with the female as he reads these "former pleasures" in Dorothy's eyes where he can see a hint of his "former" - and inferior - self. In spite of its purported organicism, William's masculine romanti- cism, however benevolent and compassionate, actually emphasizes the dualism between man and animal. While Dorothy's animal es- tablishes a link between nature and human, the animal for William becomes a means to privilege the human and male, to explore the distinctness between the natural and the conscious worlds, and to appropriate both the animal and the female for his own voice and "ballad." To some extent the epistemological heritage of the male and fe- male writers was a shared one, but the epistemological concerns of the women differed from those of the men. Masculine romanticism sought to construct an identity grounded in the duality between the poetic voice and the outside world, based on "the quest for perma- nence," "the correspondent breeze," or the dialectic of "nature and consciousness," or "natural supernaturalism."11 But the male writ-</page><page sequence="15">Dominion, Empathy ; and Symbiosis 115 ers' preoccupation with the so-called hallmarks of romanticism - with poetic voice, the epistemology of the creative imagination, and with the limits of Adamie language - was not shared by the women writers, who focussed instead on what has been called an "ethic of care" (Gilligan, 174). As Anne Mellor has observed, "They grounded their notion of community on a cooperative rather than possessive interaction with a Nature troped as a female friend or sister," resist- ing the "model of oppositional polarity (as the foundation of both the natural and the human worlds) for one based on sympathy and like- ness" (Mellor 1993, 3). Speaking with a rather tired (and tiresome) Eurocentrism, Freud observed in the early years of this century that "there is a great deal of resemblance between the relations of children and of primitive men towards animals. Children show no trace of the arrogance which urges modern adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line be- tween their own nature and that of all other animals" (Freud, 126). Undermining this "hard-and-fast line" between the animal and the human is one of the central impulses of romanticism, and regardless of gender, compassion and sympathy are omnipresent in its im- pulse. Yet few romantic texts can be said to culminate in a convinced affirmation of unity or to display a confident movement out of dual- ism - either to monism or to pluralism. Rather, the paradigm of most masculine romantic texts is an open-ended exploration of the dialec- tic between the adult, male consciousness and its constructed Other. Texts that appear to dismantle instead reinscribe the appropriative dualism between Man and animal that is at the heart of masculine romanticism, a duality that feminine romanticism's symbiotic bonds frequently question.12 By subverting the polarities of dualism, and therefore of ambiguity, the texts of feminine romanticism dismantle the hegemony of Man.

Greek thought characterized by Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, and Pythago- ras can be seen permitting an anthropocentric view of the universe as well as the notion of continuity between all living things. Aristotle, for instance, ascribed anima nutritiva , the feeding principle, to all living beings - human, animal, and vegetable - but anima sensitiva, the principle of sensation, only to humans and animals. Although anima rationalis was a human faculty, this was essentially a distilled form oì anima sensitiva, and all living beings shared the common bond of anima, the life principle (Noske, 44). 2. Judeo-Christianity posed problematic demarcative boundaries, espe- cially in the attribution of a soul to Man alone, whose twice-given dominion over other creations could be interpreted as divine sanction for exploitation of animals. In addition, scholastic Aristotelianism in its Christianized inter- pretation by the thirteenth-century Schoolmen augmented this division. The contradictions in Christianity are encapsulated by the opposed views of Lynn White Jr. and Donald Worster. White has referred to Chris- tianity in its Western form as "the most anthropocentric religion the world has ever seen" (White 1967, 1205), while Worster, among others, has drawn attention to the leanings of "left-wing" Protestantism as well as the assump- tion of accountability inherent in the Christian concept of stewardship that undermine the anthropocentric exploitation attributed to Christianity by White (Worster, 187-88). 3. For instance, the official Church denial of animal souls notwithstand- ing, pre-Christian Celtic and Germanic animistic influences had endured in European jurisprudence to the extent that animals were known to have served as witnesses to crimes or to have been executed for crimes (Ritvo 1990, 1-2). 4. See, for instance, Exodus 23 : 12: "on the seventh day you shall abstain from work, so that your ox and your ass may rest"; Deuteronomy 22:6-7: "When you come across a bird's nest by the road, in a tree or on the ground, with fledgling or eggs in it and the mother-bird on the nest, do not take both mother and young. Let the mother-bird go free, and take only the young; then you will prosper and live long"; Deuteronomy 25:4: "You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the corn." 5. Genesis 1 : 26 -28: "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness to rule the fish in the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all wild an- imals on earth, and all reptiles that crawl upon the earth'"; Genesis 9:2-3: "The fear and dread of you shall fall upon all wild animals on earth, on all birds of heaven, on everything that moves upon the ground and all fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. Every creature that lives and moves</page><page sequence="17">Dominion, Empathy ; and Symbiosis 117 shall be food for you; I eive you them all, as once I gave you all green plants." 6. Mellor states, however, and aptly demonstrates through her reading of John Keats and Emily Brontë, that "gender-biased romantic ideologies are grounded not on biological sex but rather on socially constructed and there- fore fluid systems of discourse" (Mellor 1993, 4). 7. Dorothy Wordsworth is included in the Norton Book of Nature Writing (Finch and Elder) and Mary Shelley in Derek Wall's Green History: A Reader in Environmental Literature, Philosophy, and Politics (1994), but none are in- cluded in either Ivo Mosley's The Green Book of Poetry (1993) or Jon Wynne- Tyson's The Extended Circle: A Dictionary of Humane Thought (logo). 8. Even Cowper declared that Man could exterminate "creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight" without blame. 9. Yet Dorothy's journal records William's telling her "how they used to kill all the white ones [butterflies] when he went to school because they were frenchmen" (Dorothy Wordsworth, Grasmere Journals, ed. Pamela Woof [Ox- ford: Oxford University Press, 1993], 78). 10. "Mary Jones and her Pet-lamb" was first published in Susan Levin's Dorothy Wordsworth and Romanticism (238-41), and all quotations are taken from this text. 11. Titles of books on romanticism by David Perkins, M. H. Abrams, Harold Bloom, and M. H. Abrams, respectively. 12. Karl Kroeber, on the other hand, maintains that "at their best [the ro- mantics] were skeptical of claims that a divine origin and future personal re- demption distinguished mankind from all other natural beings." His read- ing of the biases of the [male] romantics as "proto-ecological" rather than appropriative emphasizes the ecological nature of their acknowledgment of duality: "the highest attainment that the romantics can imagine for a human being is a capacity to endure violently contradictory emotions. Ambiva- lence must characterize the most intense experiences of creatures at once natural and cultural, whose finest achievements necessarily express aware- ness of the irresolvably dubious implications in that duality" (52).
