Roylance SPECIAL Graphic Arts exhibition on "The Art of Botanical Illustration" (15 October-15 December, Sterling Memorial ^ Library) is the second in a series of Yale University Library exhibitions relating to the history of science as it is so beautifully exemplified in illustrated books, fine prints, and drawings. As in the first of these exhibitions, "The Art of Scientific Illustration" (15 March-15 May 1968), an attempt has been made to stress the graphic conjunction of art and science that is to be discovered in early printed books and prints, and to display some of the wealth of materials in these areas of special collecting in the Yale University Library. The plant world, in its omnipresence, proliferation, and perennial reflowering is usually taken very much for granted. Yet few aspects of our experience combine so many both utilitarian and life-enhancing benefits. From the Garden of Eden to a future (hopefully) beautified America, plant life has set the scene for the best and greenest of pos- sible worlds. Only the eighteenth-century boudoir artist Boucher could find nature too green: "la verd, c'est de trop" But for most of us, trees, flowers, and gardens are still among the best of life's amenities, cool places where the beleaguered mind and spirit may still retreat, as in Elizabethan poet Marvell's "The Garden," "To a green thought in a green shade." The beauty of nature, however, has been historically a discovery secondary to that of the utilitarian value of plants. It is this emergence of botanical illustration from the solely practical applications and medicinal uses of the early herbáis to floral art for its own sake that has been emphasized in the chronological arrangement of this ex- hibition. In addition, all of the special printing techniques of the Graphic Arts - woodcut, engraving, etching, mezzotint, color printing, lithog- raphy, nature printing, and photography - distinctively emerge with- in the historical span of the exhibition to identify themselves with the various successive phases of botanical books, to be recognized as</page><page sequence="3">ioo THE YALE UNIVERSITY essential influences on the progressive development of botanical illus- tration, both as art and science. I. Fifteenth Century: The Garden of Health - Woodcut Herbals In an age of short life expectancy, due to the plague and countless other bodily ills, it is not surprising to discover in the graphic arts of the Middle Ages the frequent theme of "The Dance of Death." This class of starkly macabre woodcut books and prints of the ever-present image of Death is cheerfully counterbalanced by another type of illustrated book of the period, the woodcut herbal. In the herbal, all the ancient traditional cures from plants were compiled into a sort of printed garden pharmacy, usually titled the "Garden of Health" (Hortus Sanitatis in Latin, or Gart der Gesundheit in German.) i. Herbarius Latinus (Mainz, P. Schoeffer, 1484). The first German printed herbal, printed by Gutenberg's associate Peter Schoeffer, is shown here opened to the woodcut representation of a lily. As in all fifteenth-century printed herbals, the illustrations are created from cross- grained blocks of wood cut to leave a relief image, which is then inked and printed along with the text, and subsequently hand colored.

Austrian National Library, Vienna. Facsimile. This is the earliest surviving manuscript herbal, and the fountainhead for centuries of later herbáis, both for text and illustrations. The facsimile edition shown here is opened to a frontispiece painting depicting the artist at his easel, at work on the botanical illustration of the manuscript, and on the right, the author of the text, Dioscorides himself. Yale Medical Historical Library. 3. Apuleius Barbarus: Manuscript herbal. Written at Bury St. Ed- munds about 1 120 A.D. Bodleian Library, Oxford (Roxburghe Club facsimile). This early manuscript herbal is remarkable for the unusual realism of many of the drawings, and for the graceful, almost calligraphic, manner in which the plants intertwine themselves within the text. Gift of Frank Altschul. 4. Gart der Gesundheit (Mainz, P. SchoeflFer, 1485). This herbal is recognized as the masterpiece of all early woodcut herbáis. Both text and illustrations achieve an independence of observation lacking in most fifteenth-century herbáis, and the woodcuts, while still crude, were not surpassed in quality until the time of Bruníeis (see No. 15 below). The herbal is opened to the remarkable medieval version of the mandrake plant. The root of the plant comes in two sexes, male and female, and must be pulled from the ground only with the most elaborate ritual. It is presented as a cure for disorders of the eyes and ears, and as an aid for apoplexy. With her long flowing hair and modest pose, the charming maiden depicted reminds us of Botticelli's famous painting of Aphrodite. Yale Medical Historical Library. Gift of Harvey Cushing. 5. Hortus Sanitatis (minor): Gart der Gesundheit (Augsburg, H. Schönsperger, 1487). The great popularity of the herbáis may be seen in their frequent piracy by other printers. Schönsperger managed to copy all the cuts, set the type, and print his own edition in the space of five months after the appearance of Schoeffer's great herbal of 1485. In the following years, Schönsperger issued no less than seven other editions of the book. In his 1487 edition, Schönsperger changed part of the woodcut frontispiece. The unidentified, still dignified herbalists are significantly removed from the garden setting given them by Schoeffer, and placed in a medieval pharmacy, surrounded by shelves of herbal jars and cannisters. 6. Gart der Gesundheit (Lübeck, 1492). This Flemish herbal is opened to the depiction of the Muza tree. Adam and</page><page sequence="5">IO2 THE YALE UNIVERSITY Eve appear on either side of this most famous of early plants of the Garden of Eden, with Adam reluctantly about to taste the forbidden fruit. Yale Medical Historical Library. Gift of Arnold Klebs. 7. Hieronymous Brunschwig: Das Distilierbuch . . . (Strassburg, 1521). The arts of distilling gave forth not only the pharmaceutical essence of plants, but also the ancient tonics of wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages. Several German editions of Jerome of Brunswick's Liber de Arte Distillandi (1500) appeared during the first part of the sixteenth century, all illustrated with herbal woodcuts and congenial scenes of banqueting. Yale Medical Historical Library. 8. Dialogus creaturarum moralisatus . . . (Gouda, Gerard Leeuw, 1480). The delightful animism given to certain plants in the medieval herbáis is encountered throughout one of the most disarming of early printed books, the "Dialogue of Creatures," published by Gerard Leeuw in the Netherlands. Here all nature - sun, moon and stars, stones, plants, and animals - engages in the most cordial conversation. The book consists of a series of these moralistic dialogues between creatures, such as that between the partridge and the rose tree. The partridge discovers that every rose has its thorn: "The rose be both swete and softe, but the thornis be sharpe and prykkyth me of te" (Haslewood translation). Gift of Mrs. David Wagstaff. |Q^% ^</page><page sequence="6">LIBRARY GAZETTE 103 II. The Sixteenth Century: Botany as Art The pursuit of the beautiful rather than the useful in plants was not unknown during the period of the woodcut herbáis; indeed some of the finest delineation of flowers, always in the most brilliant natural pigments and appropriately microcosmic scale, is to be found in the miniature paintings of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century manuscript il- lumination. 9. School of Ghent: Manuscript Book of Hours, ca. 1485. All of the floral decorations of this small and very beautiful manuscript are scientifically accurate botanical specimens. The painted flowers, crisp as mineral crystals, be jewel every page. Because of the transparent thinness of the vellum, each painting is exactly duplicated, back to back, on each vellum leaf. Purchased on the Beinecke Fund. 10. Giovanni Boccaccio: La Teseide, French illuminated manuscript. ca. 1475. Austrian National Library manuscript No. 2617 (fac- simile). Perhaps the prettiest of garden scenes in medieval art appears in this single page from a manuscript by the unknown artist of one of the most famous of all French illuminated manuscripts, King René of Anjou's Livre du coeur d'amour épris. The Boccaccio love scene is enacted in a setting worthy of a mille-fleurs tapestry, with carnations, roses, violets, and pinks all easily recognizable in both the garden and border. Graphic Arts Collection. 11. Albrecht Dürer: Water-color drawing of an iris (collotype fac- simile), ca. 1506. Several of the great masters of Renaissance art made individual flower studies. Leonardo da Vinci included several fascinating drawings of plants in his notebooks, and Dürer made several studies of plants as preparation for details of his paintings. The iris displayed here was used by Dürer for his painting of the "Madonna with the Iris" in the National Gallery in London. Graphic Arts Collection. 12. Herbarium, arborum, fruticum, frumentorum, ac leguminum (Frankfort, 1546). Yale Medical Historical Library. Gift of Harvey Cushing. 13. Otto von Brunfels: Kreuterbuch . . . (Frankfort, 1546). The popularity of simple herbáis as books of remedies continued throughout</page><page sequence="7">Aiolà. SD&lt;l&gt;t2'ufcolfFirpccflc fcîmf^ua^a*</page><page sequence="8">LIBRARY GAZETTE 105 the sixteenth century. Two herbáis, both issued in Frankfort in 1546, represent the continuing tradition of the casual copying of copies in most early woodcut herbáis, long after the first-hand observation of plants insisted on by Brunfels and Fuchs. 14. Hans Weiditz: Water-color drawing made in 1529 for Brunfels' Herbarium vivae eicones. (Facsimile from Rytz, Pflanzenaquarelle des Hans Weiditz . . . 1936.) Graphic Arts Collection. 15. Otto von Brunfels: Herbarium vivae eicones . . . (Strassburg, 1532). The designs created by Hans Weiditz for Brunfels' Herbarium are peerless among early botanical works. The extraordinarily beautiful water colors Weiditz prepared for the woodcuts of this book have survived, and rival the draftsman- ship of Dürer, with whom his work has often been confused. A fine facsimile of one of these water colors, for the plant orpine, is shown together with its corresponding woodcut. The Weiditz illustrations are the first "living portraits of plants," of Brunfels' Latin title, and these both sensitive and vigorous studies are a world removed from the slavish copying of the earlier woodcut herbáis. To the artist's delight but the scientific botanist's disapproval, Weiditz records specific, individual rather than general, characteristics of his plants, and records faithfully worm-eaten or wilted leaves, broken stems and roots, or the beautiful effect of wind-blown plants. Yale Medical Historical Library. Gift of Harvey Cushing. 16. Leonhard Fuchs: De historia stirpium commentarii insignes (Basel, 1542). The text of Fuchs' great herbal, as in most fifteenth- and sixteenth-century herbáis, is largely derived from Dioscorides, but in infinitely more scholarly form. The illustrations, while lacking the genius of Weiditz, are of very high quality, and are impressively presented through the superior printing and typog- raphy of Fuchs' Swiss printers. For once, credits for the illustrations are not only given, but graphically glorified in a fine full-page woodcut depicting the artists, Heinrich Füllmaurer and Albrecht Meyer, and the engraver, Veit Rudolph Specklin. Yale Medical Historical Library. 17. Leonhard Fuchs: De stirpium historia . . . (Basel, 1545). This is the so-called "Little Fuchs," with the same cuts as the folio edition of 1542, reduced greatly in size. The delicately executed woodcuts are titled with the names of the plants in Latin and German. Yale Medical Historical Library.</page><page sequence="9">io6 THE YALE UNIVERSITY 1 8. Binding for Leonhard Fuchs* De historia stirpium commentarii insignes (Lyons, J. de Tournes, 1555). This beautiful little binding, with its variety of leaves and flowers richly gold tooled over the entire surface, is in the style of the sixteenth-century French binder Clovis Eve. The binding was specially made for Pietro Duodo, the Venetian ambassador to Paris in the late sixteenth century. Yale Medical Historical Library. Gift of Harvey Cushing. III. The Seventeenth Century: Tulipomania - Engraved Illustration The love of flowers developed to an almost inexplicable degree in the Low Countries during the seventeenth century. This grand passion of the Dutch for horticulture was dramatically recorded in both the art and economic history of the period. In art, a school of flower painters emerged who created a series of "floral-baroque" still-life oil paintings difficult to match in the history of art for richness of texture and trompe Voeïl realism. In economic history, the rage for a new floral species imported from Turkey resulted in a national fever, "Tulipomania." In the jealous desire for new and ever more exotic varieties of tulip bulbs, a Dutch horticultural stock market emerged, with fantastic financial speculation, inflation, and economic crisis pre- cipitated by this one flower.</page><page sequence="10">LIBRARY GAZETTE 107 In the graphic arts, the seventeenth century saw the decline of woodcut and the emergence of etching and engraving on copper as the dominant technique for the illustration of books. The engraved frontispiece became almost obligatory for books, and almost all scien- tific illustration, including botanical books, took advantage of the added precision and clarity of fine detail possible with the etched or engraved copperplate. 19. Philip Reinagle: "Tulips." Mezzotint and aquatint print by Richard Earlom from Thornton's Temple of Flora (London, 1805). The Tulipomania of seventeenth-century Holland spread to England, but was somewhat modified by English satire on tulips and their fanciful names. Addison, in The Tatler (17 10), reports overhearing a conversation between two horticulturists: "[I heard them mention that] the Crown of France was very weak but that the Marshall Villars still kept his colors. At last one of them said that, if they would go along with him, he would show them a Chimney Sweeper and a Painted Lady in the same bed, which would very much please them." As late as the nineteenth century, the English were not immune to a modified Tulipomania. In the grand "Tulips" color plate from The Temple of Flora may be seen Louis XIV, General Washington, the Duchess of Devonshire, and Earl Spencer. At this time in England a single Louis XIV bulb sold for as much as forty guineas. Lent by Mrs. Paul Mellon. 20. Crispin de Passe the Younger: Hortus floridus (Utrecht, 16 15). This engraved florilegium is one of the most attractive and influential of all early flower books. The cloistered garden of the engraved title includes many familiar flowers, with the central flower bed proudly flourishing the much favored tulips. Crispin de Passe, a member of a celebrated family of Dutch en- gravers, was still a very young man when he created the Hortus floridus. The English poet Thomas Wood published the English edition of Hortus floridus shown here. Wood prefaces his translation with a charming acrostic poem on the artist's name and concludes with his own favorable judgment of young Crispin: "You will confesse and graunt with mee, This youth desearves much praise." Lent by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon. 21. Maria Sybille Merrian: Metamorphoses insectorum Surinamen- sium. (Amsterdam, 1705). Seventeenth-century lady entomologists were even rarer than lady artists, but Maria Merrian was eminent in both fields. She was also an adventurous</page><page sequence="11">io8 THE YALE UNIVERSITY lady and in 1698 went to Surinam (Dutch Guiana) where she made the drawings for this splendid folio volume. The insects of Surinam are given wonderfully exotic botanical settings, but Maria Merrian's scientific observation is not always entirely correct. The hand coloring is probably the work of her daughter, who accompanied her mother on the expedition to Surinam, and usually did the coloring of Maria Merrian's plates. Purchased on the James Lyman Whitney Fund. 22. Das kleine Buch der Tropenwunder (Leipzig, Insel Verlag, 1943). A much reduced but very well-printed modern facsimile of the plates of Maria Merrian's Metamorphoses. Graphic Arts Collection. 23. Jan van Huysum: A flower piece. Mezzotint engraving by Richard Earlom. An important new engraving technique was developed in the seventeenth century, the tonal process of mezzotint. The process is a variation of intaglio engraving, with the entire surface of the copper plate roughened by special tools, then burnished carefully in areas that are intended to print in white or gray. A splendid example of mezzotint is shown here, by Richard Earlom after one of the Dutch flower pieces by Jan van Huysum. Graphic Arts Collection. 24. Le Jar 'dinier du Pays-Bas (Brussels, 1672). This seventeenth-century Flemish garden book includes sections not only on all traditional elegant aspects of gardens - pavilions, parterres, fountains, and arbors, but also on the utilitarian necessities of compost heaps and work tools. Immune from changes of fashion, the garden-tool woodcuts, only slightly streamlined, could serve to illustrate a modern mail-order catalogue. 25. Jacobus van Huysum and Georg Ehret: Water-color drawings of lilacs. Jacobus van Huysum was a younger brother of one of the most famous of Dutch flower painters, Jan van Huysum. (No. 23) Jacobus is the principal illustrator of two of the botanical folios of this exhibition - John Martyn's Historia plantarum rariorum (No. 32) and the Cátalo gus plantarum (No. 27). Jacobus left Holland to work at Chelsea for Horace Walpole in copying the paintings at Houghton. But after two years "his drunken dissolute conduct occasioned his being dismissed" (Walpole). An example of Jacobus' botanical work may be seen here in one of a series of six of his original water-color drawings now at Yale. The relatively prosaic quality of his work may be noticed in comparison with additional drawings that are to be discovered on the same sheets. These much finer renderings offer an interesting discovery: the minuscule signatures, nestled on the green leaves</page><page sequence="12">LIBRARY GAZETTE 109 like minute leaf -caterpillars, of Georg Ehret, the most celebrated botanical illustrator of the age. Gift of Mrs. Wilmarth S. Lewis. 26. John Parkinson: Paridise in sole (London, 1629). Parkinson's Latin title is a neat pun on his own name (Park in sun), and the text throughout reflects a similar delightfully cavalier spirit, describing "all sorts of pleasant flowers which our English Ayre will permit to be nourished up." Parkinson was the first English author to describe the tulip fully, and he lists 140 varieties "all now made denizens of our Gardens, where they yield us more delight and more increase for their proportion than they did into their owne naturals." He also reports the bulbs to be beneficial as medicine, wine, and aphrodisiac. Purchased on the Albert H. Childs Memorial Fund. IV. The Eighteenth Century: English Gardens - Color Printing Dutch influence dominated English botanical art of the early eighteenth century, and many of the illustrators working in London were emigres from Holland. In the actual cultivation of plants the</page><page sequence="13">no THE YALE UNIVERSITY Age of Reason created the famous formal gardens of the early eigh- teenth century. The period also saw the development of landscape gar- dening as a profession. "Capability" Brown and Humphrey Repton be- came the most successful of a new breed of garden planners. In science, one of the most famous of botanists, Linnaeus, created his "Sexual System" in which all plants could be grouped according to the number and arrangement of their stamens and styles. Anyone able to count up to 20 could thus easily classify plants, which helped to encourage a vast increase in popular botany, particularly among young ladies. This popularity in turn made possible the meteoric rise of eighteenth- century horticulturists, nurserymen, and florists. In the graphic arts, aquatint, stipple engraving, and mezzotint were developed into highly skilled intaglio color-printing techniques that produced some of the most beautiful of all botanical prints. 27. Catalogus plantarum (London, Society of Gardeners, 1730). The Society of Gardeners was a guild of horticulturists organized about 1724 to promote their own and their customers' interest in plants and gardens. The Catalogus was to be a series of four volumes, illustrated principally by Jacobus van Huysum, and etched or engraved by Henry Fletcher and Elisha Kirkall. The colored frontispiece radiates allegorical peace and plenty, and displays a formal, almost geometric, boxwood garden that is a triumph of the hedge- pruner's art over nature. Gift of Mrs. Wilmarth S. Lewis. 28. John Hill: Exotic Botany (London, 1772). John Hill, like his botany, was both exotic and ambitious. Besides garden planning and dubious science, he practiced medicine, acting, play writing, literature, and scurrilous journalism. Christopher Smart, his journalistic cor- respondent, pronounced him "Pimp! Poet! Paffer! 'Pothecary! Player!" Hill's boundless energy and ambition produced a huge botanical work, The Vegetable System, in twenty-six thick folio volumes, which weigh down eight folio shelves in the Beinecke Library. The illustrations of Hill's botanical works are decorative, but often over imaginative. Wilfrid Blunt quotes Dr. Johnson's damning comment on Hill, that he was "an ingenious man, but had no veracity." 29. Robert Furber: Twelve Months of Flowers (London, 1730). This lavish folio, much sought after, and all too often broken up by modern interior decorators, is in reality a deluxe eighteenth-century seed catalogue. Furber was a Kensington nurseryman who employed the Dutch artist Peter</page><page sequence="14">LIBRARY GAZETTE in Casteels to create a series of drawings showing the seasonal favorites available for each month of the year. They are presented in the grand manner of the Dutch flower pieces of Jan van Huysum. Bound with this is a similar series of Twelve Months of Fruits. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Wilmarth S. Lewis. 30. Robert Furber: A Short Introduction to Gardening (London, 1733). This octavo volume is Furber's textual supplement to Twelve Months of Flowers, providing several indexes to the varieties of flowers and fruit trees of England, and giving the time of the year they are best planted. 31. Humphry Repton: Hints, plans and sketches for the improve- ment of stonelands in Sussex. Manuscript sketchbook, 1806. The eighteenth century's philosophical belief in the rational control of nature has an excellent manifestation in the work of a late eighteenth-century land- scape gardener, Humphry Repton. Repton casually manipulates landscape like an omnipotent stage designer, moving trees, shrubs, and flowers, and even hills and valleys to create a more favorable (Repton's) design. His suggestions to his clients were delineated in a series of manuscript albums which contain small f oldout flyleaf s to show the before and after views. Gift of Miss Elizabeth W. Manwaring. 32. John Martyn: Historia plantarum rariorum (London, 1728). The illustrations by Jacobus van Huysum for this work are of unusual in- terest as an early English experiment in color printing. Elisha Kirkall, the engraver of the plates, has used a partial mezzotint process, roughening the copper in only the dark areas to be printed with a special toothed roulette tool. Colored inks were then daubed only into appropriate areas. Wiped of all excess ink, the plate was then printed with the heavy pressure of an intaglio press. 33. Pierre- Joseph Redouté: Illustrations for Augustin Pyramus De- candolle's Histoire naturelle des plantes grasses (Paris, Didot, 1799). Flower painting in France at the close of the eighteenth century and in the early decades of the nineteenth century reached a zenith of quality and splendor never since surpassed. Under the royal patronage of Marie Antoinette and the Empress Josephine, several superb illustrated botanical works were created by Gerard van Spaëndonck, Pierre Turpin, and Redouté. A new engraving technique imported from England, stipple-engraving, proved ideal for the subtle detail and tonal shading of Redouté's work. This process of engraving by dots rather than lines was adapted by Redouté and his engravers into their own special color-printing technique, which involved the use of more than one color of ink on one plate, applied with a dauber and wiped, and later finished with water-color wash. Redouté's Lilacées and his</page><page sequence="15">112 THE YALE UNIVERSITY more famous Roses are among the most brilliant examples of intaglio color printing ever produced. 34. Pierre Turpin: Illustrations for Humboldt and Bonpland's Mimoses et autres plantes legumes du nouveau continent . . . (Paris, 18 19). In a period of more brilliant natural history artists, including Audubon and Redouté, the work of Pierre Turpin has been unjustly neglected. His works, perhaps not quite so effective as flower prints, are to be more appreciated for their scientific observation, particularly in dissection details. Goethe much admired the drawings he saw by Turpin, and regretted that he had not been able to have him illustrate his own Metamorphose der Pflanzen. V. The Nineteenth Century: Floral Sentiment and Fantasy In addition to more serious scientific work (Nos. 48-51), nine- teenth-century book illustration and graphic art created a new popular interest in botany, and botanical recreation now became prevailing</page><page sequence="16">LIBRARY GAZETTE 113 fashion. Lady painters of every age and class copied flower prints and the "Language of Flowers," nurtured by Victorian sentimentalism, became a cult. A splendid folio picture book of flowers, perhaps the most famous of all such flower books, was published early in the century: The Temple of Flora. Besides their visual splendor, the color plates of this lavish folio are replete with the classical allusion, poetic excess, dark mood, and exotic atmosphere characteristic of nineteenth-century romanti- cism, and make The Temple of Flora the perfect graphic manifestation of the romantic period. At almost the same time that The Temple of Flora was being issued, lithography, a chemical, planographic process of printing from a stone surface, was discovered in Germany by Alois Senef elder (1796), and introduced into England by Johann André (1801). By the middle of the century lithography had superseded both wood and intaglio en- graving techniques and produced several masterworks of botanical illustration (No. 48). Photography, the ultimate scientific image-making process in the graphic arts, was discovered in France in 1826 by Niepce. In England, as early as 1833, Fox Talbot displayed his own "Photogenic Draw- ings" of flowers and leaves as the first botanical photographs. In 1844 Talbot published some of these botanical specimens in his famous The Pencil of Nature, the first photographically illustrated book. 35. Mary Lawrance: A Collection of Roses from Nature (London, 1799)- This modest, less than mediocre, work has the dubious distinction of almost continuous disapproval from the botanical critics. In 1802 Roessig wrote: "Her botanical draughtsmanship is mostly inaccurate, and she rarely takes notice of the characteristic features of a rose. The lighting of the leaves is extremely bad, and only here and there one comes across one or two roses which are unmistakably identifiable." Dunthorne calls her leaves, "meaningless net- works of lines," and Blunt provides the negative capstone with: "Miss Lawrance, for better or for worse, was by profession a teacher of botanical drawing." 36. Alphonse Karr: Voyage autour de mon jardin (Paris, 185 1). 37. Eugène Nus: Drôleries vegetales . . . (Paris, 185 1). 38. Albert Jacquemart: Botanique des dames (Paris, 1840).

Such bindings enjoyed a special vogue during the middle of the nineteenth century. Graphic Arts Collection. Gift of Miss Edith Wetmore. 39. Flora's Lexicon (Boston, 1857). 40. The Language of Flowers (Philadelphia, 1839). These small octavos devoted to the language of flowers were published in great numbers in England and America during the nineteenth century. While trivial as botanical art, they are interesting as a manifestation of Victorian romantic attitudes and are full of wonderfully awful poetry and sentiment. These naïve little books must also be considered the nineteenth-century bib- liographic equivalent of the infinitely more artistic and sophisticated emblem books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 41. Philip Reinagle: The Night-Blowing Cereus, with "Moonlight by Pether," engraved by Dunkarten. Philip Reinagle: The Superb Lily, engraved by Richard Earlom. Plates from: Robert John Thornton: The Temple of Flora (London, 1 799-1 807). The writings of Linnaeus inspired Dr. John Thornton to commit himself to the huge publishing venture that was to bring him both fame and financial ruin, the New Illustration of the Sexual System of Linnaeus. The work was issued in parts between 1799 and 1807, with the best artists and engravers of the day contributing the magnificent color plates. The third section of this work is entitled The Temple of Flora and contains 32 plates. It is these color-printed mezzotint engravings that have earned the book its fame. In the prefatory "Exploration of the picturesque plates" Dr. Thornton writes: "Each scenery is appropriate to the subject. Thus on the Night-Blowing Cereus you have the moon playing on the dimpled water, and the turret-clock points to XII, the hour when this flower is in its fullest expanse . . ." and concludes his "explana- tion": ". . . it is hoped that the rigid botanist will excuse the author, who, striving at universal approbation, has thus endeavored to unite the 'Utile Dulci.' " In spite of its ponderous size and romantic affectation, The Temple of Flora emerges as one of the graphic monuments of both fine bookmaking and botanical illustration of the nineteenth century. Lent by Mrs. Paul Mellon. 42. Robert John Thornton: The Temple of Flora, or Garden of the Botanist, Poet, Painter and Philosopher (London, 1812). This is a rare edition, in a smaller size and with a complete re-engraving of the color plates, issued shortly after the folio edition. Given in memory of Rachel McMasters Hunt by her son Richard M. Hunt.</page><page sequence="18">LIBRARY GAZETTE 115 43. The Journal of Design and Manufactures (March-August, 1 849) . Realistic floral motifs became particularly prominent in the applied design of the nineteenth century. Fabrics have always had floral patterns, but usually more abstracted and stylized than they appear in the near-infinite yardage of Victorian calicoes and muslins. 44. Walter Crane: Color woodcut wallpaper. 45. Walter Crane: A Floral Fantasy (London, 1899). The art nouveau style of the 1890s, particularly as it is seen in some of the designs of William Morris and Walter Crane, is almost completely patterned on botanical motifs. In his Bases of Design, Crane acknowledges his debt to historical botanical illustration. An original drawing for the endpapers for his A Floral Fantasy and a section of a wallpaper print shown here demonstrate his affectionate reliance in his art on the flower world. Gift of Mrs. Catharine Tinker Patterson. 46. Edward Lear: Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets (London, 187 1). Lear's "Nonsense Botany" is a delightful spoof of the Latin nomenclature of botany, with such phenomenal specimens as "Phattfacia Stupenda" and "Manypeeplia Upsidownia." 47. Jean Grandville: Les Fleurs animées (Paris, 1847). The colored title page of Grandville's floral fantasy suggests the "Many- peeplia Upsidownia" of Lear's "Nonsense Botany." The world of Grandville is more surrealistic than satirical, however, and belongs in the surreal tradition of the bizarre fruit-and-vegetable portraits of Arcimboldi and the Chinoiserie flowers of Pillement. Gift of Miss Edith Wetmore. 48. James Bateman: Orchidaciae of Mexico and Guatemala (London, 1837-41). This is one of the finest of the botanical books produced in lithography. A charming woodcut, "The Librarian's Nightmare," by George Cruikshank satirizes the gigantic size of this folio volume. 49. Thomas Moore: The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland (London, 1855). Nature-printed by Henry Bradbury. 50. Vienna Imperial Printing Office: Examples of Nature-Printing (Vienna, 1853). "Nature printing" - printing from actual plants - has been attempted since the fifteenth century. The technique was considerably refined in the nineteenth</page><page sequence="19">ii6 THE YALE UNIVERSITY century when a plate was created by passing the plant between plates of soft lead and steel. The impression received by the lead was then galvanized, creat- ing an electrotype. Henry Bradbury, who produced the plates for The Ferns of Great Britain, wrote a treatise on the history and method of nature-printing. Gift of the Osborn Botanical Library. 51. The Botanical Magazine (London, 1787-1968). The first and most famous of journals related to botany was founded by William Curtis after the financial failure of his Flora Londinensis. The maga- zine was a great monetary success, and Curtis remarked of his experience, "one brought me pudding, and the other praise." The long life of the Botanical Magazine makes it an excellent survey of the graphic arts of its period as well as of botany. The illustrations of the first volume exhibited were created by hand-colored line engraving, which was used until 1845. The second example shows the hand-color lithography used until 1948. The third selection represents four-color half tone - the least satisfactory of color-printing techniques. Four- color gravure has been used since 1949. The early volumes shown are from the library of John Ruskin. Volumes later than 1 82 1 are from the Kline Science Center Library. 52. Jean Morelle: Art nouveau binding. Paris, 1888. Gift of Susan Dwight Bliss. 53. Gustav Kolb: Von der Pflanze zum Ornament (Göttingen, 1900). The preference for straight or curved line, geometrical or floral motif, identi- fies the decorative design of many periods. This lithographed treatise on "Plants as Ornament" demonstrates the heavy reliance of the art nouveau style of the turn of the century on the curvilinear forms of the plant world.

The Orient The intense identification of the Orient with nature made plants and natural scenery as important to the art and philosophy of the Chinese as anthropomorphic inspiration was to the art of the Greeks. Oriental graphic arts also reflect this emphasis, but with far greater concern for beauty of form and the metaphysical meaning of man's place in the natural world, than to botanical science. 5 4. Woodcut from The Ten-Bamboo-Studio. A series of color woodcuts known as the manuals of The Ten-Bamboo-Studio and the Mustard-Seed-Garden were created by the Chinese toward the end of the seventeenth century. These were intended as instruction manuals in the art of painting birds and flowers. Bamboo, with its Buddhist connotation of resilience under stress, was a favorite subject. Lent by Dale Roy lance. 55. Chêng-yen Hu: Letter papers. Chinese woodcut with gauffrage. These note papers created in the late eighteenth century constitute a pictorial survey of Chinese decorative motifs, including many of plant life. Graphic Arts Collection. 56. Hokusai: Mangwa. Color woodcut. The Mangwa was an encyclopedic sketchbook created by the master of Japanese Ukyo-Ye, Hokusai, to illustrate every aspect of daily life in nine- teenth-century Japan. The volume illustrating flowering trees is shown here. Graphic Arts Collection. 57. Hiroshige: Field of Iris. Color woodcut. The color woodcuts of Japan offer one of the most rewarding areas of interest in the history of the graphic arts. Nearly all aspects of human ex- perience are beautifully delineated and color printed from wood blocks by the artists and artisans of this Japanese nineteenth-century art. A graphic master- piece of the period, Utamaro's Flowers and Insects contains particularly beauti- ful floral subjects. Lent by Dale Roy lance. 58. Binding doublure. Lacquer painting. Iran, nineteenth century. 59. Hafiz: Diwan (Iran, 1531). The great contrast of desert and gardens made flowers richly synonymous with beauty in Persian art. Persian carpets, glazed tiles, and illuminated manu-</page><page sequence="21">ii8 THE YALE UNIVERSITY scripts all relied heavily on floral motifs, and according to legend helped to give to dwellers of a desert environment at least the vicarious satisfaction of flowering gardens. Lent by Thomas E. Marston. VII. The Twentieth Century Five centuries after the woodcut herbal, the plant world continues to be an inspiration to the makers of books and prints. Examples of modern herbáis may be seen in Thomas Fassam's Herbarium for the Fair (No. 67) and Esther Baskin's The Poppy and Other Deadly Plants (No. 63). A water-color drawing by a recent Yale graduate, Lance Hidy, is directly inspired by fifteenth-century herbal illustration (No. 69). Far from being anachronistic or reactionary, these and many other twentieth-century graphics are exciting proof of the continuing beauty and vitality of the art of botanical illustration. 60. Archibald Thorburn: Water-color study. Thorburn was a naturalist best known for his water-color renderings of birds. In his ornithological habitat scenes, and occasional still lifes, he also painted very attractive botanical subjects. Coe Ornithological Collection. 6 1 . Clare Leighton: Poppies and Poppy Pods. Original wood-engraved blocks and proofs. The art of wood-engraving, from Thomas Bewick to Reynolds Stone and Clare Leighton, has proved a graphic medium particularly congenial for natural history. Clare Leighton has created many effective botanical illustrations for her own books on country and farm life.

Eliot Porter: In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World (San Francisco, Sierra Club, 1962); Forever Wild: the Adirondacks (New York, Harper and Row, 1966); Summer Island: Penobscot Country (San Francisco, Sierra Club, 1966). A recent series of books on natural history has been created from the photo- graphs of Eliot Porter. They manage to convey both the unexpeced beauty of wild plants and the photographer's love of these subjects. An inexpensive edition of these books has also been published, in reduced format and on non-glossy paper, with sometimes improved effect. 72. Thomas Brown: Color Photographs of Orchids. Black and white studies of leaves. Mr. Brown is currently an instructor in photography in the Graphic Design program of the Yale School of Art and Architecture.</page></plain_text>
