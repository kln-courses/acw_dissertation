<plain_text><page sequence="1">CREATION, REVELATION, AND THE ANALOGY THEORY τ: 1ΗΕ heart of St. Thomas Aquinas's views on the nature of language about God is his thesis that all assertions about God are to be construed analogically.1 Aquinas offers this as one thesis, but it is fruitful to regard it as consisting of two separate claims: a linguistic subthesis, which provides for the formulation of analogy rules governing the meaning derivations of terms in natural language; and a metaphysical subthesis, designed to facilitate the application of these rules to theistic language, by expressing the truth (as Aquinas saw it) of the cosmological relation that exists between God and the objects of creation.2 One of the main purposes of this paper will be to argue that the theology of revelation requires us to construe this relation between God and the world as an ontic (or ontological), and not a cosmological, relation. That is, the theology of revelation behoves us to construe the relation between God and the world as an isomorphism of being, antecedent to any act of divine creation, and not as something which is the mere consequence of God's creative activity (as would be the case in a cosmological relation).3 (AL)(AL) Natural language has two analogy rules, one for 'attribution' and the other for ,proper proportionality', which specify that the in stances of a term are analogues if they instantiate a semantic property (of the term in question) which conforms in its use to either or both of these rules.4 In both these rules instances of the same term (the ana logues) are applied to different objects (the analogates); they differ, 1 It must be emphasized at the outset that Aquinas does not present a syste matic and comprehensive exposition of the analogy theory in his writings. Rather, his discussions of analogy are scattered in the following texts, Summa Contra Contra Gentiles, I. 32-5; and Summa Theologica, I. 13. 2-6. Most of these texts are reprinted as an appendix in Humphrey Palmer, Analogy (London: Macmillan, !973). PP· 165-76. Aquinas's sometimes confusing insights have been extended into more comprehensive doctrines by his numerous interpreters, with the result that the analogy theory is a Protean creature existing in several different versions. It is impossible, therefore, to specify a definitive Thomist analogy theory, and I shall restrict my discussion to a small selection of analogy theorists whose writings are relevant to the limited objectives of this paper. 1 We shall refer to these two subtheses as (AL) and {AM) respectively. 3 The full implications of this distinction between the two types of relation will emerge as our discussion proceeds. 4 Aquinas actually formulates four analogy rules, but since only the rules for attribution and proper proportionality feature in his account of the nature of theistic language, we are justified in restricting our attention to these two rules. [Journal of Theological Studies, N.S., Vol* XXXII, Pt. 2, October 1981]</page><page sequence="2">402 Κ. SURIN however, in their mode of application. With regard to the first rule— the analogy of attribution—the property or attribute signified by the term in question really belongs to one, but not the other, of the objects. With regard to the second rule—the analogy of proper proportionality— both objects actually possess the property signified by the term in ques tion. Aquinas uses the term 'health' to illustrate the way the first rule works. According to him, we can say both of a diet and a man that they are healthy, although the property being healthy, which is signified by the term 'health', actually belongs to the man only: in describing a diet as healthy we merely assert that it is the cause of health in the man.1 Like wise, the term 'life' illustrates the way the second analogy rule works. When we assert of a man and an aspidistra that they both possess life, we mean that each of them is, in the literal sense of that term, alive. Or in scholastic terminology, the property signified by the analogous instances of a term is found formally in both of the analogates in question. At the same time, the analogy theorist wishes to qualify this rule by saying that the property is possessed in a mode commensurable with the 'degree of being' constitutive of the analogates in question. This qualifi cation is standardly expressed in terms of the quasi-mathematical formula: 'the life of a man is to the essence of a man as the life of an aspidistra is to the essence of an aspidistra'.2 {AM){AM) The similarity of meaning among the instances of a term, estab lished by the two analogy rules, is connected with the similarity of the things things possessing the property signified by that term. (Such a term will therefore be one that can be predicated of both God and the objects of creation; it thus signifies a property which can be ascribed, in a suitably qualified sense, to both God and such objects.) Aquinas's account of the nature of theistic language hinges crucially on {AM), since he wants to say, essentially, that the terms of our language can have a theistic reference, and can be used to describe God in a suitably qualified sense, precisely because of the cosmological re lation that exists between God and his creation. Accordingly, the corner stone of Aquinas's analogy theory is his metaphysics of creation: without it the analogy theory remains a merely interesting and original theory about meaning derivation in ordinary language. That is, without the metaphysics of creation embodied in, or presupposed by, {AM), the ' Summa Theologica (hereinafter referred to as S.T.), I. 13. 2. AH translations will be from the Blackfriars translation (London: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, 1964- ). 22 Logically minded philosophers have found it easy to demolish this type of formula.

It would not be a theo-logic. And since the present discussion is concerned with Aquinas's theory from the point of view of its application to theistic language, our attention must focus on this metaphysics of creation, and its role in connecting Aquinas's two subtheses to form a general ana logical theory of theistic language, i.e. a theo-logic.1 But first we must dwell briefly on St. Thomas's motivation for constructing such a theory. Aquinas believes he needs an analogical theory of theistic language because: (a)(a) If the predicate terms in God-statements are completely equivocal (that is, applied in totally different senses from the ones they possess when applied to mundane objects), then any inferences from statements about such objects to statements about God will be invalid, committing the fallacy of equivocation; and all God-statements will be cognitively non-significant, because we will not be able to explicate these statements in terms that are accessible to the experiences of creaturely objects. The outcome of equivocal predication is agnosticism, and this Aquinas finds totally unacceptable, since it goes against the basic presupposition of his theology that our natural cognitive powers can furnish us with evidence for the truth of theistic statements. (b)(b) If the predicate terms in God-statements are univocal (that is, applied in the same senses as the ones they possess when applied to mundane objects), then our conception of God will be anthropomorphic, since our explications of God-statements will be derived solely from the experiences of creaturely objects. Aquinas contends that if we are to describe the transcendent Christian God, then our descriptions of him must mark him off as an essentially different kind of being from anything encountered in our experience. As a consequence of the constraints expressed in (a) and (b), the pre dicate terms in God-statements must be partially equivocal with regard to their counterpart terms in ordinary experience-describing statements. Aquinas holds that a systematic elucidation of the relation between God statements and ordinary experience-describing statements must involve an analogy theory, and, moreover, that if we use such a theory, we shall 1 Thus James Ross's rigorous and ingenious resuscitation of the analogy theory is, I fear, vitiated by the fact that he construes it entirely in terms of (AL), to the exclusion of {AM): he gives us an analogy theory, but not one that can be regarded as a theo-logic. In fairness, it must be said that it is not his intention to propound a theory about statements that apply specifically to God. See Ross, op. cit., for his representation of Aquinas's theory.</page><page sequence="4">404 Κ. SURIN preserve both the notion of God as an utterly transcendent being and the intelligibility of theistic discourse, and not rule out the possibility that human experience can provide some evidence for the truth of state ments about God. His motivation, therefore, is to steer a course between the twin pitfalls of agnosticism and anthropomorphism.1 According to the analogy rule for attribution, we can call God by the names of his actions, because he is the cause of his actions. Thus, when we say that God is wisdom we merely assert that he causes wisdom to exist in the objects of his creation. The term 'God' is for Aquinas an abbreviated definite description or predicable general term (nomen naturae),naturae), signifying all the properties attributable to him by virtue of his being the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Three major problems are likely to arise in connection with the application of the rule for attribution. First, since Aquinas uses the existential arguments of the Five Ways to establish certain relations between God and the world, any objections to these arguments will immediately render the analogy theory suspect (with regard to its function as a theo-logic). Against this possible objec tion, James Ross has proposed that we can, for the sake of argument, either assume that there is reliable evidence for the existence of an entity which is First Cause, Cosmic Designer, etc., or accept as a matter of religious faith that such a Creator exists.2 Ross's proposal, however, is almost certain to frustrate one of Aquinas's key objectives in formulating an analogy theory, viz. the preservation of the cognitive significance of theistic language. Aquinas's theory purports to be a theory of the meaning of theistic utterances, but it is also more than just a semantic theory. For in purporting to be such a theory it presupposes that certain correspon dences can be established between the nature of God and the nature of creaturely objects—the theory cannot get off the ground without these correspondences. However, as a necessary condition of establishing these correspondences, Aquinas has to assume that true statements can be made about God: if he cannot say anything about God that is true, then he cannot claim to have established any valid correspondences. Con sequently, Aquinas's meaning-theory presupposes a theory of the truth 1 It must be pointed out that Aquinas does not construct the analogy theory with the explicit intention of making it a theory of theistic language. He begins by formulating it as a general theory of the way language refers to things (AL),(AL), and only then uses it to resolve the specific question of the cognitive significance of theistic discourse ((AL) plus (AM)). Even so, his theory must be an amalgam of (AL) and (AM) if it is to be a properly constituted theo-logic. 22 For his proposal see Ross, op. cit., p. 134. A lucid presentation of the objec tions to the Five Ways is to be found in Anthony Kenny, The Five Wavs (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1969).</page><page sequence="5">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 405 of theistic statements, as a condition of preserving the cognitive signifi cance of these statements. Ross's proposal, by assuming the truth of theistic statements on purely fideistic grounds, suffices to get Aquinas's theory off the ground, but only at the price of surrendering the principle that analogical language can express our cognitions of the objective reality that is God. For to uphold this 'objectivity principle' we have to accept that theistic statements can conform in principle to canons of truth, intelligibility, and rationality that are extrinsic to faith and its requirements, and this is precisely what the fideist will not, or cannot, allow. Any formulation of the rule for attribution must respect this 'objectivity principle' if it is to accord with Aquinas's intentions in for mutating the analogy theory.1 Second, it would seem obvious to that problematic creature—the simple believer—that when we ascribe a property to God, e.g. wisdom, we mean just what we say, that is, that God is wise as an intrinsic part of his nature. Third, we know that Aquinas himself is not prepared to ascribe to God's essence all the properties of which he is the cause; he does not argue, for example, that God is a body because he creates creatures that are embodied. Aquinas, then, definitely does allow exceptions to the principle established by the analogy rule for attribution, i.e. the principle that we can call God by the names of his actions because he is the cause of his actions. This raises the obvious question of the criteria by which he allows exceptions to this principle, for if he has no such criteria he is open to the charge that he applies this analogy rule arbitrarily. And, moreover, the more exceptions he allows to this principle, the less informative the rule for attribution becomes. However, modern analogy theorists take this problem seriously, as they do the other difficulties we have just listed. Their standard manoeuvre at this juncture is to augment the rule for attribution with the rule for proper proportionality.2 The analogy rule for proper proportionality enables the analogy theorist to say that the attributes we ascribe to God actually inhere in him, but only in a manner appropriate to his essence. Thus, 1 The very fact that Aquinas uses the 'rational' arguments of the Five Ways to undergird the analogy theory shows that he rejects fideism as a means of getting the theory off the ground. For fideism presupposes that there can be no rational demonstration of the intelligibility and truth of theological statements, and Aquinas, as we have just seen, needs a theory of theological truth on which to hinge his theory of theological meaning. Moreover, this truth-theory has to be one which preserves the cognitive significance of theistic discourse, and fideism cannot give him such a theory. We have no alternative but to reject Ross's proposal. 2 See, for instance, E. L. Mascall, Existence and Analogy (London: Darton, Longman &amp; Todd, 1966), p. 122.</page><page sequence="6">406 Κ. SURIN although God is wisdom, he is not wise in the way that human beings are wise: his wisdom corresponds to his self-subsistent being, and none of us is that kind of being. Unfortunately, the invocation of the rule for proper proportionality in this context only creates another difficulty for the analogy theorist, because Aquinas maintains that we cannot know God's essence (S.T. I. 13. 1). That this contention of Aquinas's is inherently agnostic is obvious from the following passage of H. P. Owen's, a modern analogy theorist who follows Aquinas on this matter: We do not know God's essence. Therefore we cannot understand the manner in which his attributes belong to him. In any comparison between God and man we understand the analogue only in the human analogate. Its mode of being in the divine analogate is permanently hidden from us in this life. Hence there is not a complete comparison between our use of analogy in the finite realm and our use of it in religion. When we inter pret another person's character by analogy with our own we can (to some extent at least) imaginatively 'enter' into his experience; for we are fellow members of the human species. But we cannot enter into God's experience; for we cannot share his Godhood (or aseitas). . . . Hence, though we can predicate personality of God we cannot understand its mode of being. We know that God is personal; but how he is personal we do not know. The doctrine of analogy does not 'explain' his nature in the sense of 'making it plain' to our understanding. Rather it states a mystery which no human mind can pierce.1 This account of the modus operandi of the rule for proper proportion ality is unacceptable for the following reasons. First, in asserting that the analogy theory 'states a mystery which no human mind can pierce', Owen, and Aquinas with him, seem to be going against a basic presuppostition of the latter's theology we mentioned earlier, viz. that our natural cognitive powers can provide us with evidence for the truth of theistic statements. This presupposition lies behind Aquinas's espousal of the analogy theory, and to say that this theory 'states a mystery which no human mind can pierce', without qualifying this statement, is equivalent to saying that what this theory entails is beyond the compass of our natural cognitive powers. On this interpretation, Aquinas might as well abandon natural theology, and. 1 The Christian Knowledge of God (London: Athlone Press, 1969), pp. 209-10. When it comes to seeking a clarification of Aquinas's insights, I have chosen to follow analogy theorists who work within the modern tradition of philosophical theology (e.g. Mascall, Owen, and Ross), rather than the classical analogy theorists (e.g. Cajetan, Pdnido, and Garrigou-Lagrange), simply because the former group are less rigid in their adherence to the traditional categories of scholastic philosophy. In so doing we run the risk of misinterpretation, but this risk is warranted by the restricted task we set ourselves in this paper.</page><page sequence="7">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 407 instead rely on God's grace to make known to us the truth of theistic statements.1 Second, mysteries are apt to be uninformative, and the generally uninformative character of the rule for proper proportionality is obvious. For what the rule does is to assert that a relational likeness exists between the way in which some creaturely attributes are proportioned to creaturely nature, and the way in which God's attributes are proportioned to his nature; it does not, however, provide for any direct comparisons between the two types of attributes. For, basically, in order to show that a re lation of proportional similarity exists between two objects, we have to establish a relation of similarity between them in the first place. And we could not establish such a relation unless we have some antecedent knowledge of God's nature and attributes. This much was perceived by Berkeley, who said, 'You cannot argue from unknown attributes, or, which is the same thing, from attributes in an unknown sense.'2 This antecedently required knowledge, however, cannot be provided by the rule for proper proportionality since it is presupposed by it. At this juncture, modern analogy theorists, e.g. Mascall and Owen, reverse the manoeuvre that they resort to when faced with difficulties apropos the other analogy rule (the rule for attribution): they now revert back to that rule as a means of circumventing their problems apropos the rule for proper proportionality.3 The presumption made by the analogy theorist is that although the two analogy rules are insufficient when taken in dividually, they are mutually validating and sufficient when taken con jointly. This presumption is open to serious objection, not only because the rule for attribution has its own problems (as we have already indi cated), but because it is question-begging in quite a serious way, and so cannot supplement the rule for proper proportionality in the way required by the analogy theorist. To see this we have only to consider the relation the rule for attribution has to the existential arguments of the Five Ways. Aquinas (and Mascall, Owen, and Ross, following him) 1 According to this interpretation the Thomistic analogia entis would have to be replaced by an analogia fidei. This suggestion has been made by Karl Barth, in his Church Dogmatics (Edinburgh: Τ. &amp; T. Clark, 1936- ), I/i, p. 274. Congenial though this suggestion may be to a Barthian, it is not one that Aquinas can readily accept (qua natural theologian). Later on I shall argue that the analogia entis entis and the analogia fidei presuppose each other and that it is therefore mis leading to suggest that one can be replaced by the other. 1 G. Berkeley, Alciphron, or the Minute Philosopher (1732), IV. xviii. Quoted in Palmer, op. cit., p. 106. 3 The analogy theorist can therefore be likened to someone who drinks alternating doses of two different poisons, each of which is the antidote to the other—to survive he must obtain a very precise balance between the dosages of the two poisons. Similar care must be exercised by the analogy theorist as he alternates between the via affirmativa and the via negativa.</page><page sequence="8">408 Κ. SURIN use the Five Ways to establish that several relations exist between God and the world: (i) 'being moved by'; (ii) 'being efficiently caused by'; (iii) 'being conserved in existence by'; (iv) 'being excelled by'; and (v) 'being designed by'. These relations, as we have seen, are required to operate the rule for attribution, but they are used in a different sense from their mundane uses, that is, they are used analogically; however, this analogical use cannot be interpreted in terms of the rule for attri bution because it is presupposed by it. For the terms in the relations expressed by (i)-(v) have to be construed analogically, and yet (i)-(v) are required to operate the rule for attribution. Furthermore, as was pointed out above, Aquinas has to assume that true statements about God are possible before he can assert that (i)-(v) specify certain relations between God and the world. That is, he needs a theory of truth for theistic statements before he can account for their meaning, and this is incon gruous: it is a philosophical commonplace that a statement has to be meaningful before it can be assigned a truth-value. It follows, a fortiori, that neither analogy rule can support the other in the way envisaged by the analogy theorists who resort to this manoeuvre. To summarize the discussion so far: we have briefly examined each of Aquinas's analogy rules, and found them to be inadequate. We then examined the strategy—adopted by some modern analogy theorists like Mascall and Owen—which purports to show that the two analogy rules, although individually insufficient, can be regarded as mutually support ing when taken conjointly. This strategy we found to be unworkable. The analogy theorist, if our arguments are correct, is faced with the crucial problem of providing a twofold basis for the operation of both analogy rules. With regard to the rule for attribution he has to demon strate that it is possible for us to attribute the same property to both God and creaturely objects (albeit in a suitably qualified sense); and with regard to the rule for proper proportionality he has to establish that a relation of proportional similarity exists between God and such objects. Neither of these, we have argued, has been satisfactorily undertaken by Aquinas, Mascall, or Owen. I want now to argue that this failure can be overcome if we adopt a rather different approach to analogy based on Aquinas's metaphysics of creation. We saw earlier that the crux of Aquinas's account of the nature of theistic language is the metaphysical subthesis (AM), and that Aquinas articulates this subthesis in terms of a cosmological relation that exists between God and the world. The approach we shall outline and develop requires us to conceive of this as an ontic (or ontological), as opposed to a cosmological, relation between God and the world. Naturally, in so doing we are making a fairly radical departure from the traditional Thomist conception of this relation: the</page><page sequence="9">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 409 alternative we propose is not one that Aquinas himself would have entertained. Nevertheless, its basic structure is firmly rooted in his theological system, and we have only to make it explicit.1 Our approach will also have the advantage of enabling us to reconcile the Thomist analogy of being with the Barthian analogy of faith.2 But before proceeding to do this, let us consider a noteworthy attempt to get round the problems we have just mentioned by adverting to the notion of the Incarnation. The analogy theorists who make this attempt usually argue that since Jesus Christ is the ideal exemplar of the divine attributes, we can use the incarnated Christ as the primary focus of analogical pre dication: terms that are used in mundane contexts are applicable to God precisely because he is incarnated in the person of Jesus Christ. To quote Michael Durrant, an analogy theorist who espouses this strategy: ... we must look, it seems, to the pattern of Jesus Christ himself, for Christians hold that in Christ we have an instance of infinite goodness, infinite wisdom, infinite mercy, etc. Having brought out what it is to say that Christ is infinitely good, wise, merciful, etc., we can bring out the contrasts and similarities with saying that a person is good, wise, merciful, etc. This is what needs to be done and, I contend, all that can be done. . . . Christ's actions of love to his disciples and followers are precisely instances of what is intended by the phrase 'infinite love', and some future investigation must reveal the differences and dissimilarities, likenesses and similarities, between the two concepts of 'love'—the love of persons and the love of Christ; love and infinite love. To assuage the sceptic, a trinitarian would also have to show the relation between *good', ,merciful', 'wise', etc., when predicated of persons, and 'infinitely good', 'infinitely wise', 'infinitely merciful', etc., when asserted of the other members of the Trinity; but I do not see anything theoretically impossible about this once the programme has been worked out in the case of Jesus Christ.3 1 To some extent the theory we shall develop is pre-figured in S.T. I. 13.2, 3, and 6. In these passages we find an ontology of what Aquinas terms 'perfections', existing primordially and pre-eminently in God, and derivatively in creaturely objects who represent him imperfectly. Even if Aquinas does not make full provision for a theory like ours in his natural theology, the opposite is the case in his account of revealed theology (or so we shall argue). 2 Albeit with considerable modification to both Aquinas and Barth, for, as we shall see, our assimilation of an 'ontological' analogical theory to Barth's analogiafideianalogiafidei will go through only if we do two things. First, we shall have to use Eberhard Jiingel's thesis that the sphere of God's revelation is his creation, and that the language of the world can speak the truth about God precisely because it is the language of the world created by God. See his The Doctrine of the Trinity:Trinity: God's Being is in Becoming (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1976), p. 10. Second, we shall have to rely on the interpretations of Hans von Balthasar in our understanding of Barth's analogy of faith. See his The Theology of Karl Barth Barth (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1972). נ 'God and Analogy', Sophia, viii (1969), p. 23. A more detailed presentation of</page><page sequence="10">410 Κ. SURIN This programme, it seems to me, is unworkable for the following reasons: x. It is not obvious that a trinitarian can assuage the sceptic by showing that the desired relation exists between terms predicated of Jesus Christ and those predicated of the other members of the Trinity; for, quite simply, Jesus Christ possesses certain properties that other members of the Trinity cannot be said to possess. Thus, for instance, the Christian analogy theorist must accept that Christ was tempted, but it is difficult to see how the Father and the Holy Spirit can be said to be susceptible to temptation, let alone in a way that bears an appropriate relation to the temptation of Christ. The very notion of Christ's incarna tion makes a substantial, or even essential, difference to the properties that can be ascribed to him, and is bound therefore to differentiate him essentially from the other members of the Trinity. It may be possible to deny that the Incarnation serves to differentiate Christ essentially from the other persons of the Trinity; such a denial, however, will saddle the analogy theorist with the following dilemma. On the one hand, if Christ's incarnational properties do not serve to set him apart from the other members of the Trinity, then these properties must in principle be ascribable to them as well. But, as we have just seen, it is difficult to see how one such property—viz. that of being tempted—can be ascribed to the other members of the Trinity, since they are commonly regarded in the orthodox Christian tradition as being insusceptible to desire (a necessary condition of being tempted). On the other hand, if Christ's incarnational properties do set him apart from the other members of the Trinity, then the notion of Christ as the decisive locus of the imago Dei would be threatened, and we would be precluded from using the incarnated Christ as the primary focus of analogical predication. It would seem, therefore, that a trinitarian analogy theorist cannot meet the requirement that an appropriate relation be specified between terms predicated of Jesus Christ and those predicated of the other members of the Trinity. He can meet this requirement only if he is prepared to accept an attenuated conception of the Incarnation, or else resort to something like the highly this Incarnation strategy is to be found in Don Cupitt's Stanton Lectures, Christ Christ and the Hiddenness of God (London: Lutterworth Press, 1971), pp. 189 213. The history of this strategy is a venerable one: it can first be discerned in Athanasius's Dei Incarnatione Verbi Dei. Barth too makes use of a Christological foundation for his analogia fidei, but would almost certainly disapprove of Durrant's programme because for him anthropology must be grounded in Christology, and not vice versa, a principle which Durrant would have difficulty in accommodating. For Barth's principle see his op. cit. III/2, pp. 84 ff. A splendidly clear account of Barth's Christological foundation is given by von Balthasar in his op. cit., pp. 100-8.</page><page sequence="11">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 411 problematic Sabellian doctrine of untis Deus—unus Spiritus—una sub stantiastantia—una persona. This he cannot do, for the Incarnation is the nerve of his strategy, and he must at all costs preserve a sense in which the nature of Christ can be fully and properly expressed in ordinary experience-describing language. The God-Man of Durrant's programme has to hover at a very precise (linguistic) point between heaven and earth; and it is difficult to see how the other members of the Trinity can be made to hover at the same point without stirring up a whole mare's nest of problems.1 2. The proponent of the Incarnation strategy must also face up to the following dilemma: is Christ, or is not Christ, a generically different kind of being from anything encountered in human experience ? If he is such a being, then there would be no point of connection between the divine Christ and objects encountered in human experience, and we would not be able to ascribe to the incarnate God in the former any predicates describing the latter. Consequently, the advocate of this strategy is required to assume that the difference between the divine Christ and such objects is only a difference of degree, and not of kind, and so he has no alternative but to accept a degree Christology. And degree Christologies, as successive generations of theologians have noted, are open to very serious objections.2 3. It seems clear that in order to recognize Jesus Christ as the ideal exemplar of the divine attributes, we need to possess beforehand the concept of what it is for a being to be infinitely good, infinitely wise, infinitely merciful, etc. That is, we must already be able to recognize the differences involved in possessing these attributes in their finite and infinite modes, which amounts to saying that we need to establish a prior relation of proportional similarity between these modes of attribute possession. However, as we have already shown, it is precisely in this respect that the analogy rule for proper proportionality is deficient; and " A cleverly defended version of the Sabellian doctrine is to be found in G. W. H. Lampe, God as Spirit: The Bampton Lectures, 1976 (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1978). The main problem with using the Sabellian doctrine to reinforce the Incarnation strategy is that it seems to commit us to a question able degree Christology, and an unacceptable Christology is just what the proponents of this strategy want to avoid at all costs. So while the Sabellian doctrine may preserve a sense in which the nature of Christ can be adequately expressed in ordinary experience-describing language, it is difficult to see how the Incarnation strategist can resort to it. 2 We cannot present these objections here, but a conspectus of them is to be found in J. H. Hick, 'Christology at the Crossroads', in F. G. Healey (ed.), Prospect Prospect for Theology (London: James Nisbet, 1966), pp. 139-66, especially pp. 143-9.</page><page sequence="12">412 κ. SURIN since the Incarnation strategy presupposes the use of this broken-backed analogy rule, it cannot be used to remedy this deficient aspect of the analogy theory. For these reasons, then, we have to reject the strategy proposed by Durrant and those analogy theorists who advert to the notion of the Incarnation—this strategy is unworkable and another means of making the theory feasible must be sought. It was said earlier that Aquinas's metaphysics of creation (the subthesis {AM)) holds the key to any understanding of his analogy theory's function as a theo-logic (or that of any theory purporting to resemble his theory), and we have now reached a stage in our argument which requires this claim to be sub stantiated. It will be our submission that this metaphysics must take the form of an ontology for the imago Dei if the analogy theory is to be an adequate theory of statements about God. This will not only give us a theological legitimation of analogy, but will also pave the way for a possible rapprochement between Aquinas's analogy of being and Barth's analogy of faith. Aquinas's doctrine of creation is fairly deeply permeated by the neo Platonic strands of thought he inherited from Augustine.1 Plato held the view that universale (or Forms) ought to function as paradigms for human and divine thought and action. Universale, according to Plato, are ideal examples of themselves, and because they are such ideal exemplars, they can function as human and divine paradigms.2 This Platonic con ז On neo-Platonism in Aquinas's thought, see E. Gilson, The Christian Philosophy Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas (London: Gollancz, 1957), pp. 48-54; and M. Grabmann, Thomas Aquinas (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1928), ch. 4. 2 It should be noted that it is not straightforwardly obvious that Plato holds the view that universale are ideal examples of themselves. However, the evidence from his writings is marshalled and carefully examined by Nicholas Wolterstorff, in his On Universals: An Essay in Ontology (Chicago: The University Press, 197°),197°), 197°), pp. 264-79, who concludes that Plato subscribes to this view. I am deeply indebted to Wolterstorff for the remainder of my discussion: the Thomist metaphysics metaphysics of creation proposed here as a foundation for the analogy theory is almost entirely derived from his interpretation of Aquinas (and Augustine, from whom Aquinas borrows much). It should be said, however, that Wolter storff himself would disapprove of the use to which we put his interpretation, since he argues that this ontology of creation is defective because of its neo Platonic underpinning. However, since we are not concerned to evaluate Aquinas's ontology of creation as a philosophical theory, but simply to examine its role as a putative cornerstone for his analogy theory, we are justified in over looking Wolterstorff's strictures. Theological critics of this aspect of Plato's thought might prefer to detach the imago Dei strategy completely from its underpinning in Platonic ontology precisely because the latter is vitiated by the controversy over Plato's 'self-predication assumption'. Their view is plausible, especially since it is not obvious that the imago Dei strategy necessarily requires such a Platonic foundation. However, it is not within the scope of this paper to resolve this question (important though it is); although we can say, with some</page><page sequence="13">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 413 ception was taken over by Augustine, who modified it to accord with his specifically Christian understanding of the nature of creation.1 For Plato's view that universale are independently existing entities, which God must imitate as closely as possible if he is to create well, is not one that is compatible with the Christian understanding of creation. Thus Augustine asserts that 'God was not fixing his gaze upon anything out side Himself to serve as a model when he made the things he has created, for such a view is blasphemous.'2 Aquinas, who shares Augustine's abjuration of this aspect of Plato's doctrine, likewise asserts: . . . since it seems alien to the Faith that the forms of things should subsist of themselves, outside things and without matter—as the Plato nists held . . .—Augustine substituted in place of these Ideas which Plato posited the ideas of all creatures existing in the divine mind. All things are formed according to these. . . . (S.T. I. 84. 5) Both Augustine and Aquinas, then, reject the view that God creates by conforming his creative activity to an independently existing idea or set of ideas. Rather, for them God creates by conforming his creative activity to his own idea of what is created—God's ideas are the exemplars for his creative activity. Thus Augustine says of God's Ideas: The ideas are Original Forms or fixed and changeless patterns of things which have not been fashioned from the Forms themselves and conse quently, being eternal and always the same, are contained in the Divine Mind. And while these themselves neither come to be nor cease to exist, it is maintained that, in accordance with them, everything is fashioned capable of having a beginning and an end, as well as whatever actually comes into or goes out of existence.2 Although Augustine and Aquinas agree that the Divine Ideas function as exemplars, they differ when it comes to spelling out the relation these Ideas have to God. (Both Augustine and Aquinas use the term 'Idea' as a technical term signifying those divine ideas which function as exemp lars, and I shall capitalize 'Idea' whenever it is used in this technical sense.) Augustine identifies these Ideas with God's concepts, whereas Aquinas regards them as his exemplary ideas in the likeness of which he creates things. This difference will become obvious only when we caution, that it does seem possible in principle to sever the imago Dei strategy from this Platonic ontology. 1 For Augustine's Christian neo-Platonism, see A. H. Armstrong, 'St. Augustine and Christian Platonism', in R. A.

To quote him: ... by 'Ideas' we understand the forms of other things, existing apart from the things themselves. Now the form of a thing having an existence apart from the thing itself, can have two functions: either to be an exemplar or pattern of the thing whose form it is said to be; or to be the principle of knowing that thing, in the sense in which the forms of knowable things are said to be in the knower. . . . Thus the form of the house already exists in the mind of the architect. This can be called the idea of the house because the architect intends to make the house to the pattern of the form which he has conceived in his mind. Now since the world is not made by chance, but is made by God acting as an intelligent agent... there must be in the divine mind a form, to the likeness of which the world is made; and that is what we mean by an Idea.1 Now, in trying to clarify the notion of what he means by an idea, Aquinas points out, contra Augustine, that it is not to be regarded as a concept (or intelligible species, in his terminology) by which we come to under stand something, it is rather the very object of the intellect's under standing. Or as Gilson succinctly puts it, 'The idea is no longer that by by which the intellect knows but that which the intellect knows and that by which the intelligent being can accomplish its work'.2 An idea, in short, is something understood, in the likeness of which something is made. Aquinas, since he upholds the doctrine of the divine simplicity, is constrained to say that all God's Ideas are identical with himself, from which it follows that everything is made in the likeness of himself. However, since nothing but God is in the perfect likeness of God, every thing must be but an imperfect imitation of God, each according to its own degree of being: . . . divine wisdom holds the originals of all things, and these we have previously called the Ideas, that is the exemplar forms existing in the divine mind. And though they are many and various in the relationship of things to them, nevertheless they are not really other than the divine essence proportionably to the manifold sharing of its likeness by diverse things. In this sense, therefore, God is the original exemplar of them all.3 Having undertaken the necessary task of outlining Aquinas's ontology of creation (i.e. the subthesis (AM)), we are now in a position to ground the analogy theory in this doctrine of God's creative activity. According to this doctrine all things are replicas of God, since they 1 S.T. 1.15. 1. See also De Veritate, 2. 5; and 3. 1 and 7.

We are, so to speak, the in re transmutation of ideas that prior to such transmutation exist in intellectu in the divine mind, and we can now outline how the two analogy rules operate in the light of this thesis. (In so doing we are certainly not restating what Aquinas did in fact say, nor are we stating what he should have said; rather, we are stating what he could have said, if he had used a different starting-point for his analogy theory.) Where the rule for attribution is concerned, we are justified in apply ing to God terms that apply primarily to mundane objects because these objects are created by God in the likeness of his archetypal ideas which are God himself. There is an isomorphism of being between these ob jects and these archetypal ideas which are God himself, and this iso morphism generates a relation of likeness or similarity between God and us. That is, God's essence and his work of creation are not generically different, as Eberhard Jiingel points out in a discussion of divine revela tion: '. . . God's work and essence are not of two different kinds, it is is . . . impossible that the reality of God and the reality which owes its existence to God's work should be related to each other as two different ontological strata and even less that they should fall apart as two worlds separated through a χωρισμός (division)'.1 It is this generic likeness between God and his creation which the analogy rule for attri bution seeks to establish. At this point we must confront a possible objection that can be urged against this rendition of the rule for attri bution. According to this objection, the very concept of analogy of attribution entails causal—or in this context, ontic—connection between God and his creation. But, the objection proceeds, in using the rule for attribution as a basis for applying to God terms that have their primary function in human discourse, are we not making an unwarranted move from using attribution in the context of ontic connection to making it a rule rule about language ? How can we justify the transition from the context of ontology to the context of language ? Our answer to this serious ob jection is derived from Barth. If we are to formulate a viable theo-logic, that is, a language of the world that is about God, we must at least aim for a language that is capable of expressing the reality of God. Quite simply, we must, in Barth's words, 'attempt to speak theological language' (Barth, op. cit. I/i, p. 341). But we can only speak theological language if we speak of God's revelation in this language, otherwise our language will consist solely of statements which infer the reality of God from the reality of the world. The God expressed in such a language will be no more than a logical construction out of the reality of the world. The reality of God, as opposed to the reality of the world, must therefore 1 Jungel, op. cit., p. 33. Ee</page><page sequence="16">416 Κ. SURIN be our primary focus if we are to speak theological language. The reality of God is expressed by God'in his revelation of himself, and the language of the reality of God (theological language) must necessarily be the language of revelation. This is why Barth says that the language which is open to the reality of God must, 'as it were, be commandeered by revelation' (ibid., p. 340). Now, the sphere of God's revelation is his creation, and the language of the world can speak the truth about God precisely because it is the language of the world created by God, as Jiingel points out (see p. 409 n. 2 above). The language of the world can speak about God only because this language comes—via God's work of creation—from the being of God. The very language we use to speak about God is a gift of his grace, hence any language about God must be language of the connection between God and the world. All theo logical language is saturated by the being of God, and this is why attri bution, while concerned specifically with the ontic connection between God and man, is also a rule of man's language (about God).1 So, having overcome this objection, we can now reasonably uphold our rendition of the rule for attribution—namely, that we are justified in applying to God terms that apply primarily to mundane objects because there is an isomorphism of being, established by Aquinas's metaphysics of creation, between God and such objects. We must now proceed to outline a ver sion of the rule for proper proportionality, in the light of this metaphysics of creation. The isomorphism of being between God and man, which stems from our participation in the divine essence, is necessarily flawed and dis torted by our imperfect mode of participation in the divine essence. Consequently, the relation of similarity established by the rule for attri bution is only one of proportional similarity. And this is exactly what the rule for proper proportionality is about.2 If my arguments are correct, 1 The argument we have just outlined is derived from the principle, held by both Barth and Bonhoeffer, that 'it is the Word of God which places man into truth, not man's understanding of that Word'. This quotation is from Ray Anderson, Historical Transcendence and the Reality of God (London: Geoffrey Chapman, 1975), P· 80. This difficult book has profound implications for the analogy theory, which it approaches from a generally Barthian perspective. I am deeply indebted to it in my attempt to use Aquinas's doctrine of creation to tease out an analogy theory which reconciles the analogia entis and the analogia fideifidei in terms of Aquinas's revealed theology. 22 The notion of human participation in the divine essence, or divinized humanity, seems to be implicit in Aquinas's ontology of creation. This notion is to be found as a central principle in the theologies of the divine illumination of the soul developed by Nicholas Berdyaev and Vladimir Solovyev. See their respective works, The Divine and Human (London: Geoffrey Bles, 1949), ch. 8; and Lectures on Godmanhood (New York: Harmon Printing House, 1944), Lecture 8.</page><page sequence="17">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 417 Aquinas's ontological conception of God's creative activity can furnish us with an analogy theory that is a viable theo-logic, that is, a language that really is about God. But several questions remain, which we must address ourselves to, if our endeavours on Aquinas's behalf are to be fully justified. Are we now left with two analogy theories, one mediated by the cosmological doctrine of the Five Ways, and the other by the ontological doctrine of God's work of creation ? Where does one version stand in relation to the other ? Why does Aquinas only hint at the version of the analogy theory that we have just outlined ? The answers to these questions, it seems to me, lie in the area of Aquinas's distinction between truths that are known by revelation (faith) and those that are naturally knowable (reason) (S.T. I. 2. 2). Before discussing this distinction in any detail, let us say, provisionally, that Aquinas has both an explicit analogy theory, relating to his conception of truths that are naturally knowable, and an implicit analogy theory, relating to his conception of truths that are known by revelation. The former he chose to develop, the latter he did not (though he could have done so, had he chosen to, because the latter is implicit in his theological system). For Aquinas, the goal of all knowledge is knowledge of God, but revelation gives us knowledge of God from above, from God himself, whereas reason gives knowledge of God from below, by way of mundane objects. Cognition of the natural order is not the culminating point of human knowledge—there is a realm that transcends the natural order and its truths of reason, the realm of the supernatural, which is the realm of God. Cognition of the supernatural realm cannot be attained from this world by the mere exercise of our natural cognitive powers, but only through divine revelation and faith in the content of this revelation. The truths of revelation that are assented to by faith cannot be derived from the natural order; they are revealed to us by God, and we assent to them with the conviction of faith, not because we grasp them with our natural cognitive powers, but because God has elected to reveal them to us.1 Revealed and natural theology therefore have different starting points, though they are concerned with the same reality, that is, the reality of God. From this Aquinas proceeds to argue that the method of the two is also different: ... in the teaching of philosophy [i.e., natural theology] which considers creatures in themselves and leads us from them to knowledge of God, the first consideration is about creatures, and the last of God: whereas in the teaching of faith which considers creatures only in their relation to 1 For Aquinas faith and revelation are correlative notions: faith is to assent to a proposition because one accepts that it is revealed by God. See S.T. II. 1. 1; and Contra Gentiles, I. 3. But see p. 421 n. 2 for a caveat on an exclusively pro positional understanding of Aquinas's account of faith.</page><page sequence="18">418 Κ. SURIN God, the consideration about God takes first place, and that about creatures last. And thus it is more perfect: as being more like God's knowledge, for He beholds other things by knowing himself.1 From this passage it is apparent that Aquinas grants primacy to revealed over natural theology. Natural theology trades on the assumption that God is an 'existent', that is, an object to be apprehended by man as thinking subject, and hencepotentially reduces the transcendence of God to an 'immanent' transcendence. Revealed theology, on the other hand, does not relativize the reality of God to human reality, and so preserves the possibility of the absolute transcendence of God. Our attempt to eschew a purely cosmological approach, by grounding Aquinas's implicit analogy theory in his ontology of creation, accords with the primacy of revealed over natural theology—it purports to view God's creative activity from the perspective of deity (or God as subject), and not from a mundane perspective (or God as object). So, in effect, our account of the implicit analogy theory is an obversion of the explicit theory traditionally ascribed to Aquinas: that theory starts from the world, ours starts from God. There are, then, two analogy theories (or more precisely, two foundations for an analogy theory) which can be derived from Aquinas's theological system. This leaves us with the task of specifying the relation that these two theories have to each other in regard to the distinction between natural and revealed theology. We shall do this by way of determining which of the two theories constitutes the more adequate theo-logic.2 Aquinas maintains that since revelation yields knowledge of the inner life of God, the final attainment of this knowledge must await the beatific vision {vino beatified) in the afterlife. It follows from this that the articles of faith, which are established by deriving them from the content of God's mind, will be eschatologically verified: their truth, unlike that of the propositions of natural theology, cannot be inferred here and now from the reality of the world. When we attain to the beatific vision, that event will verify or falsify the articles of faith, and to this extent these articles only stand provisionally: they cannot be established by our natural cognitive powers in this life.3 Where does this leave the theo-logic 1 Contra Gentiles, II. 2. Quoted from the Dominican Fathers' translation (London: Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne, 1923). 1 Our case may be slightly over-stated at this juncture. The foregoing does not imply that there is an unbridgeable gap between Aquinas's natural and revealed theology. Rather, our purpose is to show that the somewhat rudi mentary 'ontological' analogical theory to be extracted from his natural theology needs to be supplemented by ideas derived from his revealed theology. נ The notion of eschatological verification is used here primarily for con venience. Aquinas of course wants to say something a little different from this—</page><page sequence="19">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 419 entailed by our 'ontological' analogical theory, with its grounding in Aquinas's doctrine of creation ? This doctrine of creation, with its central assertion that there is an isomorphism of being between God and his creatures, makes the implicit 'ontological' analogy theory a fully fledged analogiaanalogia entis—our being is anchored in the being of God via the imago Dei Dei of the creation.1 The explicit analogy theory, with its dependence on a cosmological interpretation of the God-man relation, is not really an analogia entis, because it does not aspire to say anything about the (inner) life or being of God, even from a necessarily eschatological perspective. It cannot be an analogy of being, because it does not come up against the being or reality of God, but only testifies to the reality of man's thinking about the being of God.2 Now since the final revelation of the precise nature of this analogia entis must await the ultimate con summation of time, to this extent it is also an analogia fidei: we have to accept it, in this life at any rate, as an article of faith. This conclusion has the slightly novel consequence of confirming Barth's basic insight concerning analogy, for in terms of the reality of the world the analogy of faith must of necessity prevail over the analogy of being. Barth's analogy of faith has a necessary eschatological dimension that is only inchoate in Aquinas's notion of the beatific vision in the afterlife. To make this dimension explicit in the version of the analogy theory we have developed, we have to resort to two items in Aquinas's system: (i) his ontology of creation; and (ii) his conception of revealed theology. By incorporating these two items into the implicit analogy theory, we can see that Aquinas too has an analogy of faith, and, moreover, one that is cast in a thoroughly eschatological perspective. But the grounding of this namely, that we shall not grasp the essence of the content of the articles of faith until the eschaton. However, verification presupposes knowledge of the content (meaning) of a proposition, because we have to determine the meaning of a statement before we can assign it a truth-value. So in talking of eschatological verification we include Aquinas's notion of the eschatological grasping of the content of the articles of faith. 1 On the imago Dei as the constitutive structure of the relation between God and man, see Anderson, op. cit., pp. 135 and 137. 2 There is another important objection to this cosmological approach. If this approach cannot take us beyond our thinking about God, how can we relate the God of cosmology to the God of revelation, the Yahweh of the Old Testament and the Father of the New? Aquinas, for example, has no qualms about equating Yahweh's description of himself as '1 am who I am' (Exodus iii. 14) with his own Aristotelian metaphysical definition of God as a being whose existence and essence are identical. This equation can only be accounted for in terms of a theology of revelation, which takes us beyond our mere thinking about God. The reader who thinks that our approach places too much weight on the theology of revelation is referred to p. 422 n. 2 for a brief statement of the role of revelation in our argument.</page><page sequence="20">420 Κ. SURIN analogy of faith is, and indeed has to be, the analogy of being—the locus of the analogy of faith is the being of God, from which he reveals himself to, and through, his creation. For God's promise, that he will reveal himself fully at the consummation of time, is grounded in the imago Dei manifested in his creation. The imago Dei in the creation betokens the fulfilment of this divine promise; it intimates to us, in the decisive form of the Incarnation, that this promise has been made, and it gives us, through the cross and resurrection of Jesus Christ, an anticipatory in sight into the mode of its potential fulfilment. Through his image God has bound himself to fellowship with man (Anderson, op. cit., p. 137). Barth, perhaps, did not attach sufficient importance to the imago Dei: its articulation in terms of a theology of creation seemed to deny his assertion of the fundamental priority of revelation over against creation. For Barth such an imago Dei possessed too many connotations of natural theology, and he was led to undervalue it.1 However, by acknowledging the rightful importance of the imago Dei in our analogy theory, we can avoid this mistaken tendency of Barth's. So, to put it schematically, Barth gives us the eschatological dimension essential to a proper under standing of Aquinas's analogy of being, while the 'ontological' analogy theory of Aquinas's gives us the requisite ontological foundations for Barth's analogy of faith. Or to put it even more briefly: analogy from the perspective of God is analogy of being, analogy from the perspective of man is analogy of faith, and the two are complementary because man has his being, through God's work of creation, in the being of God (the imago Dei).2 This leaves us with our final question, namely, why does Aquinas merely hint at the version of the analogy theory we have sought to ex plicate on his behalf? The answer, I think, lies in his account of the nature of faith, and particularly in his assertion that grace does not supplant nature, but perfects it (S.T. I. 1. 8). This assertion leads him to view faith as a gift of God's grace, while being at the same time 1 Von Balthasar makes a masterly attempt to correct this undervaluation in his op. cit., pp. 73-150· 22 If we were to expand our discussion, we would have to stress the importance of locating the imago Dei in man. Aquinas lists as 'perfections' 'ens', 'vivens', and 'bonum' in addition to personal predicates like *mind', 'will', 'wisdom', etc. 'Ens''Ens' gives us an analogia entis, but the really significant predicates in this context are the personal predicates, whose analogical use in theistic discourse hinges on man being made in the image of God. Such an analogy theory would be a fully fledged analogia personae. It may be possible to relate such an analogia personaepersonae to the notion of human participation in the divine essence, a notion central to the works of Berdyaev and Solovyev mentioned on p. 416 n. 2 above. I am grateful to an unnamed referee of this journal for this and other valuable suggestions.</page><page sequence="21">CREATION, REVELATION, AND ANALOGY 421 an extension of our natural cognitive powers. To quote Terence Penelhum: For [Aquinas] faith is essentially a matter of assenting to propositions which, though they cannot be arrived at by reason alone, it is nevertheless reasonable to assent to because certain others can be known to be true by reason alone. . . . While faith is not tentative acceptance, but whole hearted acceptance, of revealed truths, it is not irrational, since someone who has learned the truths of natural theology . . . can then reasonably give voluntary assent to the truths of revelation.... The assent which the faithful freely give to the truths revealed to them is shown to be rational assent because grounds for expecting God to have revealed them can be found in natural theology. . . .* Aquinas's account of the nature of faith can be seen to have two key features. First, it is propositional, in that faith is essentially a matter of assenting to certain truths.2 Second, the assent given by the faithful to these truths is grounded in the activity of the reasoning intellect. The first feature makes for a somewhat deracinated analogy of being: if God's revelation is of certain propositional truths, then it cannot constitute are velation of himself, that is, a revelation of his being. And since the analogy theory we have propounded is founded on the principle that divine revelation is precisely God's revelation of himself, it follows that this account of faith will have difficulty in accommodating the analogy theory we have extracted from Aquinas's theological system. The second feature, by according primacy to the reasoning intellect in understanding the contents of divine revelation, effectively subordinates revealed to natural theology when it comes to giving a theological account of divine revelation. To put it crudely: Aquinas seems to think that we would all be natural theologians but for certain limitations of the human intellect. Revealed theology is pre-eminent only when theology is viewed from the standpoint of God himself, but it must surrender this status when theology is approached from the human perspective. The upshot of this is to make anthropology the essential framework within which all theological activity is conducted. By contrast, our analogy theory is rooted in a Barthian framework which subordinates anthropology to revelation: this is the only way in which theological speech can express the reality of God. A viable theo-logic has to take revelation, and not 1 The Problems of Religious Knowledge (London: Macmillan, 1971), pp. 9-10. The view that Aquinas's conception of faith is exclusively propositional is qualified in the next footnote. 22 In S.T. II. 2. 31 we find an account of faith which suggests that it is more than just assent to propositions. Nevertheless, it seems fair to say, both on textual grounds and in the interests of the internal consistency of his system, that in the main faith for Aquinas is essentially propositional.</page><page sequence="22">422 Κ. SURIN anthropology, as its starting-point. This is our only reason for preferring our rendition of the analogy theory to the explicit theory of the cosmo logical approach. It also explains why Aquinas could not himself develop the 'ontologicaP analogy theory we have found to be implicit in his doctrine of creation. The fundamental issue is, I think, irresolvable: it comes down, ultimately, to one's own pre-theological perception of what it is to be human and to stand in relation to God.1 To see theology in these terms is to pre-dispose oneself to regarding revelation as the starting-point of theological activity. This in no way implies that anthro pology is irrelevant or that it is trivial; it is only to say that anthropology is important precisely because of the relation in which man stands to God, and it is this relation which is mediated by God's decisive act of revelation. An analogy theory that aspires to be a theo-logic must take cognizance of this decisive act, by attempting to speak it. If God is spoken of, his reality is expressed in the language of the world. God can be spoken of because he first speaks in his act of revelation. Therefore the reality of God can be expressed in an analogy theory which acknowledges the primacy of revelation.2 K. Surin Κ. SURIN 1 To quote Anderson, 'Because theology has to do with a relationship of giveness, in which God confronts us from the outset as subject as well as object, theology theology is itself a commitment as well as a question' (op. cit., p. xxii). 2 The weight of our argument bears heavily on the principle that the notion of revelation enables us to theologize from the standpoint of God. We need to qualify this principle to avoid suggesting that it is in some way incompatible with Aquinas's treatment of faith and revelation. Aquinas carefully points out that since we shall not grasp the essence of the content of the articles of faith until the eschaton, it follows that even where our analogies are grounded in an ontology of of creation (revelation), we still only know God now in so far as creaturely objects bear the divine image. Hence he insists on making an important distinc tion, in S.T. I. 13. 3, between 'id quod significant nomina' and the 'modus signi ficandi'ficandi' of the terms that belong to the language of the world. This being so, we must hold that our principle only requires theology to start from the stand point of God, not that it be seen from that perspective (this is impossible, as Aquinas points out).</page></plain_text>
