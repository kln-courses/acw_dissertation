<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steven Axelrod Baudelaire and the Poetry of Robert Lowell Although the connection has been generally overlooked by literary critics, Charles Baudelaire plays an important role in the poetry of Robert Lowell as both influence and source, and it is a role which has expanded as Lowell's career has progressed.' Lowell uses Baudelaire most explicitly, of course, in Imitations, a volume of free translations which includes fourteen of Baudelaire's poems. In retrospect, one can see that this volume constitutes a turning point in Lowell's poetry. In the poems published before Imitations, Lowell's reliance on Baudelaire is comparatively minor; but in the two volumes which follow, For the Union Dead and Near the Ocean, this reliance is crucial. In these volumes, Lowell perfectly assimilates Baudelaire's tone and subject matter into his own poetic voice. In neglecting the important role Baudelaire has played in shaping Lowell's later poetry, the critics have only followed the lead of Lowell himself. In his published interviews and essays, Lowell consistently fails to include Baudelaire when discussing the poets who have strongly influenced his work.' Nevertheless, a poet is never the most trustworthy guide to his own poetry, and Lowell, despite his air of candidness, is perhaps less trustworthy than most." A careful scrutiny of his poetry reveals that Lowell has connections with several of the French Symbolists - Mallarm6, Laforgue, and certainly Rimbaud - but that the connection with Baudelaire is by far the most conspicuous. 257</page><page sequence="2">Twentieth Century Literature Lowell's turning to Baudelaire underlines the ambiguity of his relationship to American literary tradition. Unlike Pound and Eliot in the early decades of this century, Lowell does not reject American tradition, finding nothing in it of use to the serious writer. On the contrary, much of his poetic career has been devoted to using and enlarging the resources of that tradition, as his various poems and plays on American themes testify. Although Lowell is far from rejecting his native heritage, he nevertheless finds it inadequate to his needs. In an interview with A. Alvarez, Lowell stated that "we're a country founded on a Constitution. That makes us different from the usual country founded on a history and a culture."' American culture, Lowell suggested, lacks the restraint and coherence imposed by a strong tradition. Many of Lowell's own poems and plays are attempts to provide that sense of a past, yet even fully exploited American tradition seems somehow too narrow. In addition, it is somehow alien to Lowell. In his essay on William Carlos Williams, Lowell praises Williams for having really seen America and heard its language, and laments his own inability to "enter America."5 Lowell's sensibility is marked by despair, dread, pessimism, disillusion and a sense of human limitation which more accurately reflect European decline than American ascendance. Lowell is the black swan of American letters, a truly cosmopolitan writer who does not feel impelled to reject his American roots. Lowell mines both European and American tradition, translating European poems and creating new poems on American themes, attempting to interweave and to some degree synthesize the two cultures. With- out being in any sense a literary expatriate, Lowell performs the expatriate's function. In his original poems, Lowell brings his essentially European sensibility to bear on American subject matter. It is no accident that in order to give this sensibility voice, Lowell turned to Baudelaire. Baudelaire, writing a century ago, defined the modern mood of spiritual exhaustion and psychological ex- tremity. Baudelaire anticipated the existentialist vision in European poetry just as Lowell has brought that vision to fruition in American poetry. Both Baude- laire and Lowell fit Baudelaire's description of Poe as "l'dcrivain des nerfs."' Both speak as men at the edge of an abyss: sinful, anguished, guilt-ridden, despairing, haunted by their inability to believe, pitiful and pitying. In an essay written in 1953, Lowell described Baudelaire as the first writer of modern poetry, in which "the stiffest and most matter of fact items were repoeticized - quotations from John of the Cross, usury, statistics, conversations and news- paper clippings.'" (Ironically, Laforgue referred to this very quality in Baude- laire as "I'americanisme," thus indicating the mutuality of the trans-Atlantic cultural relationship.)" In both style and sensibility, Baudelaire speaks to Lowell in a very special way. That Lowell has listened to Baudelaire, and has absorbed the message well, is revealed not in anything Lowell has ever said about his poetry, but in the poetry itself. 258</page><page sequence="3">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire Lowell's first major volume of poetry, Lord Weary's Castle (1946), shows a general Symbolist influence, but not too much more than might be expected in any volume of twentieth-century poetry. The techniques and themes initiated by Baudelaire and his successors are part of our general cultural heritage. Lowell in Lord Weary's Castle uses the Baudelairian technique of expressing emotion through images rather than by direct statement, but this Baudelairian lesson was probably relayed through the poetry of Pound, Eliot and Williams rather than learned directly from Baudelaire himself. At times, however, Lowell projects his mind onto external reality, achieving a fusion of outer and inner worlds in imagery which is authentically Baudelairian. For Lowell, as for Baudelaire, everything in the external world "devient allgorie" ("Le Cygne"). For example, "Where the Rainbow Ends" expresses Lowell's anguish at the disparity between the ideal and the real (symbolized by Baudelaire as l'azur and le gouffre) in religious terms, but the imagery and tone are thoroughly Baudelairian: I saw the sky descending, black and white Not blue, on Boston.... The worms will eat the deadwood to the foot Of Ararat: the scythers, Time and Death, Helmed locusts, move upon the tree of breath. Lowell's Boston, like Baudelaire's Paris (in Martin Turnell's words), "is not a local affair, a mere emanation of his personal sensibility ... Its significance is universal. It is the modern world."" Several poems seem to contain allusions to or borrowings from Baudelaire. "France" has imagery adapted from "Un Voyage a Cythkre" (as well as from Villon's "Ballade des pendus"). In this poem, the destruction of World War II is viewed from the vantage point of a gallows (Lowell used the word "gibbet," a cognate of Baudelaire's "gibet"). In both poems, the rotting corpse is preyed upon by ravenous birds: My bones eat through the skin And flesh.... Now here, now there, the starling and the sea Gull splinter the groined eyeballs of my sin. De fe'roces oiseaux perches sur leur pature De'truisaient avec rage un pendu dfjct mair, Chacun plantant, comme un outil, son bec impur Dans tous les coins saignants de cette pourriture; Les yeux itaient deux trous, et du ventre difondr" Les intestins pesants lui coulaient sur les cuisses, Et ses bourreaux, gorgis de hideuses dilices, L'avaient a coups de bec absolument chatr6. 259</page><page sequence="4">Twentieth Century Literature In addition, several of Lowell's poems have phrases which sound Baudelairian. For example, the poems "War" and "At the Indian Killer's Grave" contain references to "the poor dead," which may derive from Baudelaire's "les pauvres morts" in "La Servante au grand coeur." In "The Ghost," a detail in the description of a corpse - "Lethe oozes from her nether lip" - is reminiscent of Baudelaire's self-description in "Spleen #77": "ce cadavre hbeite / Oih coule au lieu de sang l'eau verte du Lethd." In "The Drunken Fisherman," the effects of aging and moral decay are expressed in terms of erosion by water, echoing Baudelaire's metaphor in "L'Ennemi." Even in this early volume, Lowell's kinship with Baudelaire asserts itself. Like Baudelaire, Lowell is at odds with his age and society, hostile to con- ventional ways of perceiving the external world, anxious to unify his inner landscape with outer reality by means of his poetry. Like Baudelaire, Lowell makes extensive use of the exile theme (the first and last poems of the volume both refer to it). But instead of presenting himself as the artist in isolation, Lowell presents himself as a Christian isolated in a materialistic, violent, God- less society. It is this Christian faith which ultimately separates Lowell from Baudelaire: Lowell is not a poete maudit, he is a poete beni. But in his succeed- ing volume, The Mills of the Kavanaughs (1951), this faith has been lost. "Thanksgiving's Over," the final poem of the volume, ends in a recognition of death and in a demonstration of the failure of Catholicism to function as a consolation: "I counted to ten thousand, wound / My cowhorn beads from Dublin on my thumb, / And ground them. Miserere? Not a sound." The way has been prepared for those poems of spiritual and psychological dislocation which we have come to think of as Lowell's authentic contribution to American poetry. Appropriately, this volume of renunciation contains Lowell's first major use of Baudelaire. It is "Mother Marie Therese," which borrows freely from Baudelaire's "La Servante au grand coeur" (thus substantiating Lowell's admission of having occasionally included "buried translations" in his poems)." The two poems are so unlike each other that it is not surprising that critics have overlooked Lowell's use of lines from "La Servante" to round out his portrait of a nun. Baudelaire's poem is an earnest, pathetic, quietly eloquent and finally very moving tribute to his childhood servant, and by extension to all the poor, the innocent and the forgotten, everywhere and at all times. The poem is both an acknowledgment of human goodness and, more typically, a pained realization of the distance which separates the poet from that goodness: the poem is a masterpiece of pity, pity for his servant and for himself, for those who are good and for those who sin. This poem is obviously quite different from "Mother Marie Therese," a Browningesque dramatic monologue in which an elderly nun remembers a now-dead mother superior in a tone of irony. Like Chaucer's prioress, monk and friar, Mother Marie Therese's piety is undercut by her worldly corruption. Yet the poem's ultimate irony is that even Mother Marie Therese seems somehow Godly when compared with the spiritual vacuum 260</page><page sequence="5">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire of the present. The "good old times," irreligious as they were, at least provided a sense of identity and belonging; but now, "We cannot say / Christ even sees us, when the ice floes toss / His statue, made by Hurons, on the cross." Contem- plating what "life's shrinkage" has left her, the nun finds her comfort not in God or religion but in her affectionate memories of Mother Marie Therese. Thus, the poem which began as an ironic study of Marie Therese's failed religiosity, ends as a sincere tribute to her as a flawed human being who never- theless attained the love of a fellow human being. The poem's shift from irony to pathos signals a shift in Lowell's values: a newly discovered pity for the human condition, an acknowledgment that we live in a God-deprived, death-haunted universe in which human connection is the supreme good. In this poem, Lowell trades his role as eccentric prophet for that of fellow-citizen. Paradoxically, only through using Baudelaire's voice could Lowell truly discover his own. It is a measure of Baudelaire's uniqueness in literary history that he, a figure of the mid-nineteenth century, could show Lowell in 1951 the way into the twentieth century. Baudelaire provided for Lowell not a sense of history but its opposite, a sense of Lowell's own contemporaneity. As T. S. Eliot pointed out in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," "not only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet's] work may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously." Thus Lowell, searching for the right language and tone to express his new concerns, adapted lines from Baudelaire. The result is a passage which is characteristically Lowellian, and of such high quality that Randall Jarrell specifically singled it out for praise." The poem begins borrowing from "La Servante" just at the point when the mood shifts from irony to pathos, in the final forty-two lines. The nun remem- bers Mother Marie Therese, drowned at sea, and thinks, "I owe you flowers:/ The dead, the sea's dead, has her sorrows." These lines are adapted from Baudelaire's, "Nous devrions pourtant lui porter quelques fleurs. / Les morts, les pauvres morts, ont de grandes douleurs." In both poems, these lines are fol- lowed by passages in which the speaker pities the corpse lying sad and lonely in her grave. Many of the same details are used. Mother Marie Therese, like Baudelaire's pauvres morts, is pictured as being "cold" ("gelds"); without bedfellows" ("sans compagnons de lit"); "bilged by her thoughts" ("devores de noires songeries"); and "worked on by the worms" ("travaillis par le ver"). Mother Marie Therese is plagued by eternity ("hours on end to lie tossing to the east") as are Baudelaire's dead ("lls sentent s'egoutter les neiges de l'hiver / Et le siecle couler"). These lines which Lowell adapted from Baudelaire are followed by a passage which describes the living as spiritually and physically cold, unlike Baudelaire's "vivants" who sleep warmly between their sheets. But Lowell returns to Baudelaire for the conclusion of his poem. In addition to using several of Baudelaire's lines verbatim, he captures Baudelaire's over-all tone of nostalgia, sorrow and universal pity, even when the words are Lowell's own. 261</page><page sequence="6">Twentieth Century Literature Lowell's great accomplishment is that, far from clashing with the poems initial tone of irony, these final lines actually assimilate that irony into a larger sense of loss and regret. Lowell's poem gracefully accommodates Baudelaire's lines. The final line, "My mother's hollow sockets fill with tears," is the same that Lowell uses to conclude his translation of "La Servante" in Imitations (substituting, of course, the word "nurse" for "mother"), yet it provides a moving conclusion for "Mother Marie Therese" as well. Lowell mutes Baudelaire's eloquence: "grands douleurs" austerely becomes merely "sorrows," and "noires songeries" becomes the non-committal "thoughts." But at the same time, Baudelaire increases Lowell's eloquence, or, more accurately, provides him with a new sort of eloquence, an eloquence of calmness rather than an eloquence of agitation. In this last third of "Mother Marie Therese," Lowell has moved into a new realm of feeling and understanding, and Baudelaire has shown him the way. In Life Studies (1959), Lowell abandons the dense, complex, rhetorical style of his early volumes for a tone of detachment, irony and calmness which communicates a sense of barely-controlled seething emotionality beneath the willed surface. Although Lowell's style in Life Studies is not authentically Baudelairian, it does foster a mood of confessional intimacy which is closer to Baudelaire than was the strained rhetoric of Lord Weary's Castle. Lowell uses this intimate mood to open up new areas of experience for American poetry. Like Baudelaire, Lowell is the marginal man, exposing in his extremity the terrors of his age, and of the human predicament in general. Although Life Studies is interesting both for its Baudelairian intentions and for its refinement of various Symbolist techniques practiced in the earlier volumes, its most striking Baudelairian turn is found not in the "Life Studies" section proper, but in part three, which contains poems about four writers. Each of the writers is an exile; each is intended to provide an analogue for Lowell himself. Lowell has always presented himself as an exile, but whereas previously he had regarded himself as an exile by reason of his mystical Catholicism, he now sees himself as an exiled artist. He still views society as spiritually and morally degraded, but he now views his superiority to society in terms of his artistic sensitivity rather than his nearness to God. Lowell's vision of himself and his relationship to society and to the Universe now closely approximates Baudelaire's. Baudelaire describes the artist as isolated and perse- cuted: "Tous ceux qu'il veut aimer l'observent avec crainte, / ... Et font sur lui l'essai de leur ferocite" ("Benddiction"). Similarly, in "Ford Madox Ford" Lowell describes Ford as an archetype of the alienated artist: "O divorced, divorced / from the whale-fat of post-war London!... /.. . Ford, / you were a kind man and you died in want." In "To Delmore Schwartz," Lowell portrays Schwartz and himself as inept, friendless, faintly comical artists, albatrosses dragged down from the skies. Their image is a stuffed duck, an ironic analogue to Baudelaire's "roi de l'azur." 262</page><page sequence="7">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire Exiles and outsiders populate the pages of Life Studies. They are all proto- types of Lowell himself, just as Lowell is a symbol of all men. The poet's isolation from society corresponds to the general spiritual isolation felt by all men. The poet, intensely conscious of the gap between l'azur and le gouffre, between le spleen and l'iddal, feels the pain of man's exiledom more acutely than most. Like Baudelaire's swan, taunted by "le ciel ironiquement et cruellemente bleu," Lowell in the depths of his anguish finds that "azure day / makes my agonized blue window bleaker" ("Walking in the Blue"). Soon after the publication of Imitations (1961), Edmund Wilson suggested that the voluume was "really an original sequence by Robert Lowell of Boston."" This aspect of the volume has generally been ignored as critics have been content to argue among themselves about the merits of Lowell's mode of creative translation. Actually, Imitations is a fragmented series with numerous related themes interrupting each other, much like the "Life Studies" section of Life Studies, the "Near the Ocean" section of Near the Ocean, and Notebook 1967-68 (and, it might be added, like Mauberly, Paterson, The Waste Land, The Bridge and almost every other important long poem in this century). Imitations, arising out of the same personal and philosophical crisis as Life Studies, is that volume's twin. Life Studies portrays a man in despair, but it does not really scrutinize the nature of that despair. Rather, the poet is viewed from the exterior, ironically, as an object of both scorn and pity. Imitations, disguised as "a small anthology of European poetry" (xi), is actually the direct presentation of spiritual and moral breakdown which Lowell avoided in Life Studies. Each poem taken by itself is primarily a translation - a free, inno- vative and imaginative translation, but a translation nonetheless. But the volume as a whole is something original and new, self-sufficient, ontologically complete. Lowell has constructed out of his versions of other men's small poems a large poem which is completely his own. This poem is an existential drama in the form of a spiritual diary. Lowell is the existential man, as described in William Barrett's Irrational Man: "solitary and unsheltered before his own death," obsessed by "the alienation and strange- ness of man in his world; the contradictoriness, feebleness, and contingency of human existence; the central and overwhelming reality of time for man who has lost his anchorage in the eternal."" Like "Skunk Hour," Imitations repre- sents the dark night of the soul, beginning in doubt and despondency, descend- ing into deepest despair, and ending with a tentative, ambiguous effort at affirmation. At the very center of this drama stands the figure of Baudelaire. The importance of Baudelaire in Imitations may be indicated in physical terms: more pages of his poetry and a larger number of his poems are included in the volume than of any other poet. But more significantly, the whole of Imitations centers around Baudelaire's poems: the preceding poems approach them, the succeeding poems retreat from them. In a sense, not only Imitations but Lowell's whole career centers around these poems: they represent Lowell at his very darkest moment. 263</page><page sequence="8">Twentieth Century Literature From the very first poem, Imitations is an extended meditation on death The volume reflects Baudelaire's belief that death is "le c6ted pique de la vie moderne," the most important subject for modern art." In "The Killing of Lykaon," Achilles, like Lowell, anticipates his death in anguished tones, bereft of spiritual consolation (Christian or otherwise): "a goddess bore me, my father reigned, / yet I too have my destiny and death." This obsession with mutability and death is intensified in the succeeding poems. Unable to find a satisfactory consolation, Lowell's suicidal impulse grows progressively stronger. Whereas the translations of Homer, Sappho, Alexander, Villon and Leopardi express deep hatred of death, the translation of Hebel, Heine and Hugo actually welcome it. Lowell's increasing depression in the first third of Imitations is partially hidden behind the mask of translation: with the possible exception of the Villon, Lowell does not seem to be speaking in anything like his own voice. In the Baudelaire translations, however, all masks are stripped away: Lowell becomes one with the poet he is translating. The Baudelaire translations expand upon the themes sounded in the first third of the volume, but in a new key. These poems are suffused with a sense of guilt and self-loathing which testify both to Lowell's Puritanical background and to the Freudian and existential angst of the twentieth century."' These poems, like the poems which precede them, depict the sins of the Universe against man, but now only as a background for an examination of Lowell's personal sins, against himself and the Universe. Lowell's greatest sin is spiritual apathy - the "boredom" of "To the Reader." This sin lies at the root of all his other sins - "infatuation, sadism, lust, avarice," etc. - but in its own right it overshadows them all: I'm like the king of a rain-country: rich but sterile, young but with an old wolf's itch, one who escapes F6nelon's apologues, and kills his day in boredom with his dogs. ("Spleen") The poet's despair is intensely personal but it also stands for the despair of all men. "A virus eats the heart out of our sides" ("The Ruined Garden"). "You - hypocrite Reader - my double - my brother!" Paradoxically, this recognition represents the peripeteia in the soul's progress. Lowell finds his own personal sinfulness and the general horrors of mortal existence redeemable only by his functioning as a poet. The poet, "dedicated without hope," plays his part in "the pageant of immortal sin," but this very dedication differentiates him from the rest of the "dull herd:" he at least is freed from spiritual emptiness, "boredom," nothingness ("The Voyage"). By exposing his malaise, the poet momentarily cures himself, or at least provides the insight which can save others. The poet supplies a set of moral references where before there was only 264</page><page sequence="9">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire a void; he gives the world meaning. The poet is thus like a profane Christ, sacrificing himself on the cross of his own insight and honesty in order to provide the spiritual and moral salvation of mankind. This identification of the poet with Christ is made explicit in "Voyage to Cythera." (Lowell makes the identification clearer than does Baudelaire, by making a "cross" out of Baudelaire's "gibet.") The mutilated Christ is envisioned as a symbol of the poet (just as the poet in "To the Reader" is a symbol of all mankind): Poor devil with sweet memories, your laws are mine; before you, I too felt those jaws: black panther, lancing crow, the Noah's Ark that loved to chafe my flesh and leave their mark. Nothing stands upright in your land, oh Lust, except my double, hanging at full length - Oh God, give me the courage and the strength to see my heart and body without disgust. At the moment of deepest despair, Lowell finds a reason for continued survival in the expression through poetry of the terrible knowledge - both of self and of the Universe - which has caused the despair. After the Baudelaire translations, the poetic tension begins to subside. Even the Rimbaud translation "The Poet at Seven," and the Rilke translations "The Cadet Picture of My Father" and "Self-Portrait," which bear a close auto- biographical relationship to Lowell's own life, at least possess a kind of detach- ment: as in Life Studies, the poet is able to view himself externally and to some degree objectively. They are an explanation of why the poet cries in pain rather than the cry of pain itself. The extreme solipsism and subjective terror Lowell manifested in the Baudelaire section has now slightly diminished; the worst of the crisis has past. In the last third of Imitations, Lowell grows progressively stronger, as is manifested by his having regained a certain aesthetic distance from his material. He is even able to find some ironic, ambiguous consolation from the human activities of sex and art. Imitations began by denying any attraction to death, by insisting on the poet's hatred of death. Seeking to refute death in some way, but unable to, the poet was obsessed and tortured by it and therefore close to suicide. In the Baudelaire translations, Lowell was able to confront death and the death-impulse in his own spirit (just as Baudelaire himself does in "Le Voyage"). Thus, Imitations, which began in inner turmoil and contradiction, ends in something approaching spiritual serenity, not by denying the horrors of mortal existence but through a process of self-recognition and identification. The volume argues for an honest recogni- tion of the conditions of life - in this century the old illusions, mainly religious, are no longer possible - and for the strength to continue living despite that recognition. 265</page><page sequence="10">Twentieth Century Literature In his translation of Baudelaire, Lowell selected particular Baudelairian notes and adapted them to his own voice, making them (in Lowell's own phrase) "ring right for me" (xiii). The kind of translation Lowell practices is best described by Donald Carne-Ross in "The Two Voices of Translation:" "Trans- lation in this sense, means that two languages, two cultural traditions, grow into each other, making both demands and concessions, appropriating areas of foreign territory and ceding some of their own. And it involves the confronta- tion of two literary personalities: Baudelaire remains Baudelaire and yet begins to resemble Lowell; Lowell is always Lowell, but a more Baudelairian Lowell than elsewhere. This dialogue, or tension, between the two texts, the two linguistic and cultural mediums, and between the two writers, is the differentia of true translation.""' As I shall argue below, the development of this Baudelairian voice is of major importance, for it speaks throughout For the Union Dead and Near the Ocean as well as in the Baudelaire translations of Imitations. Lowell alters Baudelaire's texts in numerous related ways. His general aims are to recreate the poems' original effect as nearly as possible in twentieth- century American English and also to bend the poems slightly so that they express Lowell's own concerns in his own distinctive style. In Lowell's transla- tions, there is a consistent movement toward intensification and colloquialization of language and particularization of Baudelaire's grand generalities; a move- ment from "la negresse" to "Jeanne Duval" ("The Swan"), from "les piches" to "orgasms" ("Cythera"), from "l'opium immense" to "the ivory-tower of art and dope" ("The Voyage"). Whereas Baudelaire's "Boredom" is seen "fumant son houka," Lowell's "chain-smokes" ("To the Reader"); whereas Baudelaire's symbolic swan is a great, romantic "exild," Lowell's is merely a "refugee" ("The Swan"). Lowell eliminates exclamation points, removes the capitals from capitalized abstractions (and often removes the abstractions themselves), and deletes adjectives. Lowell's specificity, concreteness and linguistic variation reflect the innovations Eliot, Pound and Williams have made in the diction of modern poetry. Nevertheless, even after Lowell has lowered Baudelaire's pitch, he still manages to retain far more rhetorical eloquence than English verse is accustomed to bearing. Most of Lowell's best moments come when he abandons Baudelaire's literal words in order to get at the tone behind the words, and to adapt that tone to his own voice. For example, in "The Swan," Lowell thinks not of "maigres orphelins se chant comme des fleurs" but of "public orphans drying up like flowers." The addition of the word "public" lends a typically Lowellian socio-political dimension to the poem, but it does not violate Baudelaire's original mood of pathos and humanitarianism. Departing from Baudelaire's literal text, Lowell time and again successfully recreates in English the grandeur of Baudelaire's rhetoric: 266</page><page sequence="11">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire A insi dans la foret ou mon espirit s'exile Un vieux Souvenir sonne a plein souffle du cor! Je pense aux matelots oublies dans une 1le, A ux captifs, aux vaincus! ... a bien d'autres encor! and in this forest, on my downward drag, my old sorrow lets out its lion's roar. I think of Paris raising the white flag, drowned sailors, fallen girls... and many more! ("The Swan") Lowell has not merely expanded the resources of poetry in English, he has discovered his own best voice. The finest poems in Lowell's two succeeding volumes, For the Union Dead and Near the Ocean, owe their existence directly to Lowell's work with Baudelaire in Imitations. Baudelaire legitimizes Lowell's tone of bitter self-exposure, his method of using external phenomena to sym- bolize internal states, and his underlying mood of cosmic despair. But most importantly, in the Baudelaire section of Imitations Lowell blends his own vigorous, colloquial, intense rhetoric with Baudelaire's classical eloquence. The resulting style, effortlessly accommodating an enormous range of rhythms and diction, is Lowell's finest accomplishment. In For the Union Dead (1964), Lowell assumes an essentially Baudelairian stance: the poet as the suffering soul of humanity, the creator of poems which contain "a la fois l'objet et le sujet, le monde exterieur a l'artiste et l'artiste lui-meme."" As in Baudelaire, multi-dimensional, evocative images function as emblems of the poet's state of mind. "The Public Garden," for example laments the end of a specific love affair and, more generally, the loss of whatever is past and can never be had again; it communicates this theme in terms of the seasonal changes in a Boston park. The poem is composed of patterns of images - involving fire, water, colors, leaves - which cannot be reduced to an abstract rational structure. The poem's meaning is contained in these images and sense impressions, which echo and amplify each other as the poem progresses: the poem seeks to achieve "une magie suggestive."" By projecting his inner vision on the world without, finding correspondences between the two, the poet has effectively controlled and concretized his emotions. In addition, he has erased conventional barriers between the human mind and the physical world, in effect denying the existence of any single, knowable "physical reality" apart from perceptions filtered through the human sensibility. The focus of these symbolic poems, then, is not on the physical world but on the human mind which must inhabit it. Some knowledge of Baudelaire is necessary to a full appreciation of Lowell's accomplishment in For the Union Dead. Without reference to Baudelaire's aesthetic, many of Lowell's poems might seem trivial, on the one hand, or self-indulgently emotional and without sufficient motive, on the other. For example, "Eye and Tooth," "Myopia: A Night," "The Drinker," "Tenth Muse," 267</page><page sequence="12">Twentieth Century Literature "The Flaw" and "Night Sweat" can only be understood as Spleen poems. Mystifying if read in a vacuum (just as Wordsworth was mystifying to readers who picked him up expecting Gray or Goldsmith), these poems act upon us most effectively when our expectations have been formed by Baudelaire: they are painful examinations of the spiritual emptiness which afflicts the poet as representative man. These poems, like Baudelaire's, generally take place at night or during rain; however they lack Baudelaire's extravagantly macabre d6cor and Gothic effects, and their season is Eliotesque Spring rather than Baude- lairian mid-Winter. These changes merely reflect the transference to a new poetic idiom: the spirit behind Lowell's poems is Baudelairian. Martin Turnell's description of Baudelaire's "Spleen" cycle applies equally well to Lowell's poems: "the drama of the exhausted mind unable to grapple with its problems and the shattered, vibrating nerves which leave it no rest."'" "Eye and Tooth" is a poem of self-torture much like "L'Heautontimoroumenos," "L'Irrepara- ble" and the four "Spleen" poems. The poem begins and ends in physical and moral pain: My whole eye was sunset red, the old cut cornea throbbed, I saw things darkly, as through an unwashed goldfish globe. Nothing! No oil for the eyes, nothing to pour on those waters or flames. I am tired. Everyone's tired of my turmoil. Like Baudelaire, Lowell can find no relief from his remorse, despair and boredom. En rouvrant mes yeux pleins de flamme, J'ai vu l'horreur de mon taudis, Et senti, rentrant dans mon time, La pointe des soucis maudits. ("Reve parisien") L'Espoir, Vaincu, pleure, et l'Angoise atroce, despotique, Sur non crdne incline plante son drapeau noir. ("Spleen" #78) Lowell attains in his Spleen poems a French eloquence unusual, if not unique, in the writings of major American poets. In "Myopia: A Night," "morning" speaks the poem's concluding line. This anthropomorphism is matched by that of "Tenth Muse," in which Lowell addresses "Sloth" as if she were his gingham- clothed beloved: Tenth Muse, Oh my heart-felt Sloth, how often now you come to my bed, thin as a canvas in your white and red check dresses like a table cloth, my Dearest, settling like my shroud! 268</page><page sequence="13">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire The imagery and tone of this passage owe a great deal to "Recueillement," Baudelaire's love-letter to his sorrow: Ma Douleur, donne-moi la main; viens par ici, Et, comme un long linceul trainant a l'Orient, Entends, ma chore, entends la douce Nuit qui marche. Lowell's poems, like Baudelaire's, probe the darkness of his own soul, "tete-a- tete sombre et limpide / Qu'un coeur devenu son miroir" ("I'lrremediable"). In Lowell's political poems, "The Mouth of the Hudson,' "Fall 1961," "Buenos Aires" and "For the Union Dead," an interaction takes place between the poet's mind and the outer world. The poet translates the social, political, moral and spiritual dilemmas of our time into a very personal, deeply-felt anguish; he feels the present age playing on his nerves. But on another level, the blighted external landscape stands for the poet's blighted soul. Thus the poems possess a double-vision, focusing inward and outward at the same time. Without an awareness of this double-vision, "The Mouth of the Hudson" might seem like a simple, powerfully-expressed but overly didactic, anti-pollution poem. In fact it is rather complex. The physical pollution of the environment is merely a manifestation of society's moral and spiritual decay (the Negro toast- ing wheat-seeds over coke fumes has been discarded by society just as surely as the old cable drums and condemned freight-trains). Just as important, the "unforgivable landscape" described mirrors the state of the poet's own soul, alienated by society's baseness and betrayed by his own failings as well. The poem gains stature because it is not merely an angry attack on American indus- try for polluting (though it is surely that in part); the poem is a vision of Hell which implicates all men (the poet included), the point being that the Hell man has created outside gives proof of the Hell he carries within. "For the Union Dead," the last poem in the volume, is one of Lowell's most successful poems. It is in the tradition of Lowell's earlier examinations of the urban ethos in Lord Weary's Castle - "As a Plane Tree by the Water," "At the Indian Killer's Grave," "Where the Rainbow Ends" - but it also strongly resembles Baudelaire's "Le Cygne," as Irvin Ehrenpreis has noted. (The resem- blance is even closer to Lowell's translation of "Le Cygne," but it is close enough to Baudelaire's original as well.) Like Baudelaire in "Le Cygne" and "Le Crepuscule du matin," Lowell in "For the Union Dead" is a walker in the city. Both poets are alienated from the moral decay they perceive around them, and they contrast the present ugliness with a ideal vision of dignity and beauty, symbolized in "Le Cygne" by Andromache and le cygne itself and in "For the Union Dead" by the old South Boston Aquarium and by Colonel Shaw, the heroic leader of a black regiment in the Civil War. The exile theme is stronger in "Le Cygne" than in "For the Union Dead" and the political concerns weaker, 269</page><page sequence="14">Twentieth Century Literature but this difference of emphasis aside, the poems are much alike. In both poems, the personal and public, and the past and present (as both exist in the mind of the poet), are effortlessly mingled. Both poems move from a sense of personal malaise to a grand sympathy for all of suffering mankind. "For the Union Dead" echoes "Le Cygne," but in Lowell's Bostonian accents, generali- ties made specific, sorrow turned to fury: Paris change! Mais rien dans ma me'lancholie N'a bougd! palais neufs, echafaudages, blocs, Vieux faubourgs, tout pour moi devient allegorie. Parking spaces luxuriate like civic sandpiles in the heart of Boston. A girdle of orange, Puritan-pumpkin colored girders braces the tingling Statehouse, shaking over the excavations, as it faces Colonel Shaw and his bell-cheeked Negro infantry on St. Gaudens' shaking Civil War relief, propped by a plank splint against the garage's earthquake. Their monument sticks like a fishbone in the city's throat. Shaw is now as exiled from the spirit of modern Boston ("he is out of bounds now") as ever Baudelaire's swan was from her "beau lac natal." "The ditch" where Shaw's body was thrown "is nearer:" Lowell sees the excavation for the underground garage (a ditch of sorts) as an analogue to the brutality and ugliness which murdered and disposed of Shaw. But then the meaning radiates outward: "Space is nearer." This is the Baudelairian abyss. Human savagery and chaos are emblems for Lowell of the cosmic nothingness, which Beaudelaire described in "Le GoufJre" as "l'espace affreux et captivant." The political and social concerns of Lowell's poem are, in part at least, metaphors for the poet's metaphysical despair. As does "LeCygne," "For the Union Dead" constantly contrasts the real with the ideal, usually by means of analogous images rather than direct state- ment. The memory of the "bubbles / drifting from the noses of the cowed compliant fish" in the speaker's childhood, exposes the evilness of the "giant finned cars" which now "nose forward like fish." The statue of Colonel Shaw contrasts devastatingly with the only memento Boston possesses of World War II: a commercial photograph shows Hiroshima boiling over a Mosler Safe, the "Rock of Ages" that survived the blast. 270</page><page sequence="15">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire Lowell's poem is angrier and more political than Baudelaire's because twentieth- century Boston is more corrupt even than nineteenth-century Paris: it is a city which blasphemously prides itself on a receptacle for lucre which is sturdy enough to survive an atomic explosion, unlike 80,000 human beings. The reality which Lowell perceives is so horrible that his final vision of a contrasting ideal of human dignity is almost overwhelmed by pathos and doubt: "When I crouch to my television set, / the drained faces of Negro school-children rise like balloons." They are like Baudelaire's true voyagers (" Coeurs IMgers, semblables aux ballons"), never straying from their destiny, heroic but doomed. In Boston, "giant finned cars nose forward like fish: / a savage servility / slides by on grease." Like "For the Union Dead," the "Near the Ocean" sequence of five poems (in Near the Ocean, 1967) exhibits Lowell's mature style, capable of expressing a range of mood and feeling equalled only by Baudelaire and Yeats among modern poets. Martin Turnell's description of Baudelaire's poetry applies per- fectly to Lowell's in these five poems: "sufficiently flexible to reflect the whispered tone of the confessional and on occasion to rise to the heights of the grand manner.""' Lowell's style differs from Baudelaire's in that it is infused with the rhythms and language of prose to a far greater degree than Baudelaire's ever was. In the poetry of Baudelaire, says Turnell, "the whole life of the great industrial city - its sights, its sounds, its smells - is added to the subject matter of poetry;" Lowell extends this accomplishment by integrating the verbal din of the city - cliches, snippets of conversations, quotations from newspapers, proverbs, statistics - into the very texture of his poetry. But the vocabulary of the city, in Lowell's treatment, assumes a grand eloquence, ironic, pathetic, charged with deeper significance, contributing to (rather than detracting from) the music of Lowell's verse. Lowell's style in these poems is both an extension of Baudelaire's accomplishment and an entirely new medium. It is perfectly suited to Lowell's imagination, which is generally more political and religious and less erotic and fantastic, more other-directed and less inner-directed, than Baudelaire's. Lowell's stylistic dexterity is best exemplified by the first two poems of the sequence, "Waking Early Sunday Morning" and "Fourth of July in Maine," both of which range from confessional intimacy to powerful public rhetoric. "Waking Early," for example, begins in the low-keyed mood of Spleen: Vermin run for their unstopped holes; in some dark nook a fieldmouse rolls a marble, hours on end, then stops; the termite in the woodwork sleeps - listen, the creatures of the night, obsessive, casual, sure of foot, go on grinding, while the sun's daily remorseful blackout dawns. Fierce, fireless mind, running downhill. 271</page><page sequence="16">Twentieth Century Literature The subject of the poem is the poet's spiritual crisis: "O that the spirit could remain / tinged but untarnished by its strain." The poet is suffering from the same cosmic dissatisfaction that is expressed in Baudelaire's "Le Voyage" and "Anywhere Out of this World:" "ii me semble que je serais toujours bien lai oiu je ne suis pas, et cette question de demenagement en est une que je discute sans cesse avec mon ame." "Waking Early" is just such a discussion with one's soul. In fact, the poem's repeated line, "anywhere but somewhere else!," closely echoes Baudelaire's conclusion to his prose-poem: "N'importe oh! pourvu que ce solt hors de ce monde!" The poet's agitation increases as the poem progresses, despite several efforts at restoring his calmness: "Stop, back off," "Sing softer." (These efforts echo the opening line of "Recueillement" as well as Milton's lowerings of pitch in "Lycidas.") As the poet decries the loss of God, he leaves his initial quiet tone behind and slowly rises to high eloquence. The poem ends in a slow withdrawal from the Earth, similar to the diminishment which occurs in "Le Voyage:" "Que le monde est petit!" Pity the planet, all joy gone from this sweet volcanic cone; peace to our children when they fall in small war on the heels of small war - until the end of time to police the earth, a ghost orbiting forever lost in our monotonous sublime. Lowell fashions this peroration, tender and bitter at the same time, by mingling banal journalistic diction and elevated rhetoric in a way which somehow animates both. The phrases "to police the Earth" and "small war on the heels of small war" smack of editorials in political journals. At the same time, "small war on the heels of small war" has certain Miltonic overtones (cf. Milton's Abyss "where eldest Night / And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold / Eternal Anarchy, amidst the noise / Of endless wars" [PL, II, 894-7]). The word "sublime," ironically evoking eighteenth-century conceptions, actually signifies merely the upper reaches of space: Baudelaire's "l'espace affreux et captivant." Lowell's use of "monotonous" also returns us to Baudelaire and the Baudelairian abyss. In "Anywhere Out of the World," Baudelaire calls monotony "cette moitik du ne'ant." And the receding view of our planet which concludes "Waking Early" is clearly predicted on Baudelaire's terrible dis- covery in "Le Voyage:" 272</page><page sequence="17">Robert Lowell and Baudelaire Le monde, monotone et petit, aujourd'hui, Hier, demain, toujours nous fait voir notre image: Une oasis d'horreur dans un desert d'ennui. The four other poems of the "Near the Ocean" sequence all show the influence of Baudelaire, though perhaps less explicitly than "Waking Early." "Fourth of July in Maine," like Baudelaire's "Moesta et Errabunda," expresses a hopeless yearning for Eden - not as a paradise of "plaisirs furtifs," but as a "time of gentleness. / ... when God the Logos still had wit / to hide his bloody hands." This is Lowell momentarily in the mood of Baudelaire's Rdvolte. But the poem ends, more typically, in Baudelairian ennui, "wild spirits and old sores in league / with inexhaustible fatigue." The fourth poem of the sequence, "Central Park," is another "walker in the city" poem. Central Park operates in the poem not only as an oppressive physical reality but as a symbol of the modern world. Humanity is seen not as exiled (like a swan in the city), but as imprisoned (like the lion in his "slummy cell" of the zoo.) As this shift in metaphor suggests, "Central Park," like "For the Union Dead," portrays a world whose brutality far exceeds that of "Le Cygne." "Near the Ocean," the title poem of the sequence, contains a resolution to the poet's spiritual crisis, a resolution quite unlike any attempted by Baudelaire. Rejecting both Baudelaire's quest for ideal Beauty and his final plunge into the abyss in quest of le nouveau, Lowell finds meaning in human connection. The speaker of the poem turns outside of himself, in a manner directly opposite to Baudelaire's "A une Passante." He makes a commitment to his wife, not as an incarnation of his own dreams of the ideal, but as she really is, a flawed, time-bound, other human being: "A hand, your hand then!... / Monster loved for what you are / till time, that buries us, lay bare." Although the "Near the Ocean" sequence ends at a point of considerable distance from Baudelaire, the poems - particularly "Waking Early" and "Central Park" - owe a great debt to Baudelaire in both style and content. Lowell speaks in the "Near the Ocean" sequence out of a personal and philosophical despair, and at a level of seriousness, equalled only by those long poems of spiritual disintegration which come toward the end of Les Fleurs du mal, "Le Cygne," "Un Voyage a Cythere" and "Le Voyage." In Lowell's latest volume, Notebook (1969, 1970) Baudelaire continues to exert an influence, but it is a lesser one, secondary in importance to that of the later Symbolists and the Surrealists. Nevertheless, Lowell's career continues to prove that cosmopolitanism - so different from either the provinciality or the genteel Anglophilia of the nineteenth century - is the dominating tradition of twentieth-century American literature. In 1927, T. S. Eliot wrote that Baudelaire "had something to do with the nineties and he has a great deal to do with us."21 Lowell's poetry demonstrates that this relevance has not diminished.

Two more recent books of Lowell criticism, Richard Fein's Robert Lowell (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1970) and Philip Cooper's The Autobiographical Myth of Robert Lowell (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1970), do allude to Baudelaire but only briefly, the first in discussing the translations in Imitations, the second most often in quoting or paraphrasing Lowell himself in an essay or interview. The one critic who does note the importance of Baudelaire to any consideration of Lowell's poetry is Irvin Ehrenpreis in "The Age of Lowell," Stratford upon Avon Studies 7 (1965), rpt. in Robert Lowell: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Thomas Parkinson, (Engle- wood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, 1968), pp. 74-98. Nevertheless, Ehrenpreis discusses the relationship between Lowell and Baudelaire in terms of "parallel" poetic sensi- bilities rather than in terms of specific influence.
