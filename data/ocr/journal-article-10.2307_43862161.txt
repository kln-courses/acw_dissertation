<plain_text><page sequence="1">Georg Toepfer, Historisches Wörterbuch der Biologie. Geschichte und Theorie der biologischen Grundbegriffe , Stuttgart / Weimar: Metzler, 2011, 2504 pp., € 299,95. Georg Toepfer s three volumes constitute the first systematic lexicon of the history and theory of biology's "basic concepts." It is a monumental work: 112 main entries listed alpha- betically and 1,760 sub-entries which are presented - with reference to both the period at which the terms were coined as well as the author who first used them - in a box at the be- ginning of each main entry. As an example, the entry "organism" includes the following sub- entries: "organischer Körper (Aristoteles 4. Jh. v. Chr.); Corpus organicum (Chalcidius 4. Jh.); lebende Substanz (Augustinus um 400); organisierter Körper (Thomas v. Aquin 1259- 64); Lebewesen (16. Jh.); Mechanismus (Stillingfleet 1662); lebendes System (Anonymus 1774); mechanistisch (von Walther 1807); Organizismus (Caffin 1822); Pseudoorganismus (von Schubert 1830); Protozelle (Gros 1851); organismisch (H.M.G. 1859); Elementaror- ganismus (von Brücke 1862); Quasiorganismus (Blackman &amp;Tansley 1905); Organismen- haftigkeit (Reinhardt 1921); Superorganismus (Wheeler 1922); Organismizität (Blanshard 1939); Organismizismus (Bartley 1941); Metaorganismus (Eisler 1949); Minimalorganis- mus (Schulz 1949-50); Minimalzelle (Gaffron 1957); Minimalgenom (Itaya 1994)" The dictionary is supplied with more than 500 illustrations and 300 charts which con- tribute to the works expository and instructional clarity, plus a terminological index found just following the introduction, in which all terms in the dictionary are listed. Each of the 112 articles opens with an etymological reconstruction, as a confirmation of the authors intention to outline the history of biological concepts and theories on the basis of the words themselves, constituting a veritable "philology of natural science" (xiv). A "systematic" defi- nition is then found in a subsequent box. This serves to condense the historical development of the concept taken into consideration according to Toepfer (ix). The historical reconstruc- tion of each concept which comes next is undoubtedly the most informative and useful part of the dictionary. It is first and foremost a historical biology dictionary, which examines the transformation of concepts that are already ancient. The history of various biological concepts is treated with philological clarity and precision, from the main debates of ancient times through the current state of research. Every article is accompanied by an impressive number of direct quotations from sources, which in some cases exceed 300 references, to the extent that each entry could be considered a mini-essay on the subject. Further, the refer- ence to a circumscribed shortlist of the most significant general works on the subject matter, found at the end of each entry, is remarkably helpful - it helps the reader not to get lost in the vastness of the bibliography. Even apart from the bulk of material that has been gathered here (an operation un- doubtedly facilitated, as Toepfer reports (ix), by the digitization of the main scientific and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 35 (2013), 111-131 129 bibliographic sources) and the organization thereof, the work would still be monumental - and perhaps courageous - for a second reason: the difficulty of identifying biology's "fun- damental concepts." Biology is a discipline in continuous transformation; its concepts are in no way unambiguous, but are characterized by "porosity" and "open texture" (xxvii). The central subject of biology itself - organism, according to Toepfer - is difficult to define. Beginning with the fundamental assumption that biology, unlike other sciences - physics, for example - is a natural science focused on concepts ( begriffszentrierte Naturwissenschaft , xxi), the dictionary's challenge is to explain the role of those of its concepts which are "most important from a theoretical point of view" (xxxvi). But what are they? And on what basis were they chosen? The author tries to explain in the introduction. Thus, we learn that "fun- damental concepts" must be understood as, besides the main taxonomie groups (such as virus, bacteria, plant, fungus and animal), the "basic organic phenomena of most living be- ings known to human beings" (such as, for example, mating, insemination, metamorphosis, etc.). These generally have to do with the processes that take place in a body and not so much with its parts (i.e., muscles and nerves, etc.), nor with particular concepts exclusively valid for a few types of organisms (xxxviii). For this reason - and this may certainly be consid- ered one of the most controversial points - the dictionary takes genetics, neurobiology and molecular biology only marginally into consideration and instead focuses directly on those biological sub-disciplines concerned with the "entire organism" - such as morphology, ecol- ogy, ethology and evolutionary biology. Moreover, if "organism" is the term that indicates the confines of biology "downwards," toward physics, seemingly erratic terms are found among the basic concepts which have, by contrast, the function of determining the boundaries of biology "upwards," in cultural terms (for example bioethics, artificial life, cultural sciences, etc.; xxiv). Further, organism and culture are two of the ten main groups (still more general concepts) - including also type, form, function, development, behavior, reproduction, evo- lution and ecosystem - under which the 112 concepts are placed in an order. It is rather obvious that such a choice - and it is the author himself who emphasizes this - could not be understood by those scientists who prefer an empirical approach (xxv): in fact, it is about general "universal" concepts (xxxviii), which, from a syntactic point of view, may be considered "primitive terms [...] defined though concepts inferred by these" (xxxvi), while from the semantic point of view "they are characterized as universal integrative concepts which have a value in the order and in the generation of the fundamental questions of research" (xxxvi). So, little by little, as one considers Toepfer s "concept table" and as one examines it more deeply, it becomes ever clearer that it is not only the work of a biologist, or of a historian of biology, but of a philosopher, rather than a cultural scientist {Kulturwissenschaftler). One might therefore be tempted to find certain similarities between this table and Kant's table of categories or - following a more modern thinker, Helmuth Plessner, also a biologist and philosopher - with "organic modais." The dictionary is part of a forma mentis - distinctly German - of con- structing great systematic models on the basis of terms considered fundamental and primitive. However, there is none of Kant's "I think," nor the Plessnerian concept of positionality, at the centre of Toepfer's system; his focus is rather the living organism. This - as has already been mentioned - is biology's primary object, and not so much the genes, species or populations. But what is an organism? For Toepfer it seems to be the same as a living entity. The author has already devoted a substantial volume, Zweckbegriff und Organismus. Über die teleologische Beur- teilung biologischer Systeme (Würzburg: Königshausen &amp; Neumann 2004), to the illustration of his idea of organism. In my view, that is the place to begin to understand the choice of the dictionary's fundamental concepts. With partial reference to the theories of chaos and organiza- tion (particularly to Stuart Kauffman), Toepfer maintains in Zweckbegriff und Organismus that the organism must primarily be understood as "an organized system," the parts of which have</page><page sequence="3">130 BOOK REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 35 (2013), 111-131 a reciprocal relationship, and only secondarily as an object that has evolved historically, and whose characteristics are the result of evolution and selection. An organism is a living system of parts which produce each other and reciprocally affect each other in their function. Such reci- procity between the parts of the organism is then designed as its internal purposiveness - and here the reference is clearly to Kantian philosophy. It was actually Kant who reformulated the concept of "internal purposiveness," making it a regulative judgment, with the precise aim of understanding the living organism, which he gave the name "organized product of nature," i.e. "that in which everything is reciprocally an end and a means" (Kant, I., 2000 [1790]), Crítique of the Power of Judgment, P. Guyer, E. Matthews transi., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, § 66, p. 247). lhe concept of internal purpose, utilized by Kant to explain that which for him cannot be explained in purely mechanistic terms, is essential for Toepfer, as it constitutes an alternative model to the "linear" teleology, which is linked to the capacity to plan and to the conscious intention of a subject which can mentally advance a future state, and which is inadequate for a scientific understanding of nature. Through a rethinking of Kants position, therefore, Toepfer re-proposes a concept of purpose that - far from animistic or vitalistic con- ceptions, as well as mental and anthropomorphic views - may be characterized by a certain causal structure that is due to the reciprocal interdependence of the parts of a system, has a "cyclical" structure, and substantially corresponds to the "organization" of the living thing. This constitutes modernity s trasformation of the ancient concept of the soul (see Toepfer 2004). One could certainly ask whether it is necessary - in order to explain the interdependence of the parts of an organism - to draw on teleological notions, and whether Kant basically meant only this reciprocity with "internal purposiveness". Even in modern theories of auto- organization, reciprocity is illustrated without recourse to any teleology whatsoever, but simply on the basis of mechanistic explanations. In fact, does teleology presuppose anything more than simple reciprocal dependence? However, what is important to emphasize at this point is primarily that it is only a consideration of this theoretical assumption (which is obviously not explicidy explained in the dictionary) that allows us to understand why entries such as reciprocal action, organization, self-organization, totality, vitalism, and function were included among the dictionary's "fundamental concepts" - besides obviously organism and purposive- ness ( Zweckmässigkeit ) - while other concepts - one being "mechanism" - are simply treated as secondary necessities within the main entries ("organism" in the case of mechanism). But not only that; the idea of process reciprocity in an organized system becomes the general model - in addition to the understanding of the organism - of even the very nature of biological concepts. "It is significant for the entire structure of the concepts of biology," Toepfer claims, "that the organisms parts and processes are determined and indicated not by intrinsic qualities but by reference to their effect on other parts or on the whole of the organic system" (xxi). Therefore, the concepts of biology, in this sense, are for Toepfer functional concepts. Finally, it is by beginning precisely from this theoretical position that one understands that what may be interpreted as the dictionary's main "provocation" - the fact that it is the work of a single author - is actually to be turned on its head. This cannot be anything but the work of a single author. Toepfer has tried, in a certain sense, pre-emptively to defend himself against the possible accusation of seeking to re-establish a kind of anachronistic universalism and against the charge that the dictionary's errors and gaps are due to its representing the perspective of a single individual. He does this, first, by showing himself as undogmatic in the choice of fun- damental concepts. Concepts such as "action, soul, spirit, knowledge, ethics, beauty" could rightly claim a place as principal terms in a biological dictionary, Toepfer affirms (xxxviii). (One might after all wonder whether including these entries in a biological dictionary would not run the risk, not only of their naturalization, but also of an infinite extension of the spectrum of "fundamental" biological concepts.)</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS - Hist.

One can also find a bibliography of the history and philosophy of biology on the authors website (http://www.georg-toepfer.de). This currently consists of a good 300 pages, constantly updated and accessible by anyone. These are certainly innovative ideas, both effective and highly informative tools. They do not, however, call into question the dictionary's architecture, which is based on the choice and organization of the concepts, and which therefore remains the product of a single author. As the dynamic between the individual view and the encyclopedic perspective is at times resolved, naturally an attentive reading of the single entries should be postponed. It is, how- ever, precisely this fruitful tension between the subjective view and the need for neutrality, between theoretic assumption and objective exposition, that makes Toepfer's work - besides as a very useful orientation tool (ix) - stand out as unique in the current historical-biological and bio-philosophical panorama.
