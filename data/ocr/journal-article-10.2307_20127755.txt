Mis soula: American Academy of Religion and Scholars Press, 1978. 133 pp. $7.50?George L. Goodwin's doctoral dissertation sets out to accomplish two things in Hartshorne scholarship: provide an interpre tive tool for understanding the validity of the ontological argument within an Hartshornean perspective and advance the discussion con cerning the validity of de re modality (essential to the ontological argu ment) considering the challenge posed by W. V. O. Quine. Goodwin attempts to prove that through the doctrine of temporal possibility Hartshorne has provided a means both for understanding the validity of the ontological argument and for meeting Quine's challenge with re gard to the possibility of de re modality. Temporal possibility means an ontology in which potentiality and ac tuality are grounded in temporal process. Potentiality is the indeter minate but determinable future. Actuality is the determinate but in determinable past. The present is the occasion of actualization in which the determinable future becomes the determinate past. The validity of the ontological argument rests on the modal charac ter of the proposition, Perfection exists. It is argued, using Proslo gium III, that to exist necessarily is better than to exist contin gently. For Perfection to be perfect (that than which nothing greater can be conceived), it must exist necessarily. If it were to exist contin gently, it would be conceivable that something better could be thought. This would result in Perfection being imperfect. There fore, with contingency removed analytically from the definition of Per fection, the only remaining question is whether Perfection is possible at all. If Perfection is possible, by definition it must exist. Chapters II and III address this question. Goodwin argues that the classical concept of God, actus purus, dis allows any form of potentiality within the divine nature. This in turn disallows any possibility for Perfection existing because on a priori grounds it denies the possibility of possibility itself. He writes: The actus purus doctrine entails a collapse in the distinction between possibility and actuality. The doctrine that God possesses all pos sible value as actual "makes possibility and actuality completely co extensive and for all purposes identical" (RSP, 117). Thus to accept the actus purus interpretation of perfection is also to accept the view that our radical experience of possibility?that is, of change, contin gency and futurity?is a mere anthropomorphism. (61) On the other hand, if God were to be understood as dipolar, in which both actuality and potentiality are present (modal coextensiveness), then a clear distinction between potentiality and actuality is able to be sustained. Contingency would not be reduced to necessity and as a result an ontology of divine necessity would not a priori preclude the possibility of finite events in time. The necessary existence of God, deduced analytically from the defi nition of God, entails only that the divine nature cannot not be. Only the divine possibility, the divine determinability, is established. Nothing is said concerning the divine states. The divine actuality is nondeducible; it is contingent upon matters of fact. The divine, neces</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 871 sary existence is thus possible because the divine actuality and the ac tuality of finite, temporal events remain contingent. Radical experi ence is preserved. Chapter IV, "Possibility and Modality," is Goodwin's most challeng ing, constructive and important contribution. On purely formal grounds he attempts to meet the objections leveled against de re and de dicto modality. He first addresses himself to Hicks's challenge that de dicto and de re modalities cannot be conflated. Hicks denies that existential status can ever be necessary. Goodwin responds that this is question-begging since "Hartshorne's argument is that while actu ality can in no case be logically necessary, the class of contingent ac tualities can?in the unique divine case?be necessarily non-empty, and this can be shown to be a logical truth"(79). The most interesting discussion, however, concerns Quine's ob jection that de re modality is confused because "the concept of necessary properties is a confused, and hence meaningless, notion" (83). For properties to be necessary they must be instanced and at least instanceable in an identical object x in this and every "possible world" (84). But how can we identify x with a given property in this world and "every possible world in which x exists" (103)? To do so, Quine argues, requires a commitment to Aristotelian essentialism. But, Goodwin claims, so long as one employs such an Aristotelian es sentialism the problem of identity remains insoluble (103). No con vincing means are available in substantialist metaphysics for identify ing essential properties in "possible worlds," or as Kripke states, in "counterfactual situations" (102, 103-104). If, however, one employs a metaphysics of temporal possibility (ge netic identity) a solution may be possible. An object x is identifiable across different possible worlds in the same way as it is identifiable across various temporal successive states: through inheritance grounded in causal efficacy. Essential properties are those properties that are internal to the unity of an entity, properties present in any future occasion having this same exact past. He writes: Possible worlds, individual identity, and essential properties are all to be understood in this context of causality?this is, I am suggest ing, precisely the superiority of Hartshorne's analysis. Essential properties are those abstract features which constitute individual identity and which must be included by every future possibility which could be actualized as a state in which this individual exists. . . . Essential properties are causally efficacious boundaries for individual development. (113) In and through an ontology of temporal possibility, Goodwin con cludes, de re modality is established. Any possible world must have certain limitations because whatever world it may be, it will be such as having a bounding or limiting past. It is precisely this limitation which makes identity possible. Goodwin's study contains two important values: First, it provides an excellent introduction to Hartshorne's metaphysics. As an introduction it provides the reader with a valuable key for understanding the es sential lines of Hartshorne's thought. Second, it brings into direct</page><page sequence="3">872 ROBERT HANNA AND STAFF discussion the relationship of metaphysics and modal logic. This may well be Goodwin's most valuable contribution. For anyone interested in present theological discussions the book should be read.?T.R.V.</page></plain_text>
