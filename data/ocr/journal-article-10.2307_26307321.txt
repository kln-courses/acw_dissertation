THE BILIMEK PULQUE VESSEL Starlore, calendrics, and cosmology of Late Postclassic central Mexico Karl A. Taube Department of Anthropology, University of California-Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521-0418, USA Abstract The Bilimek Vessel is among the most remarkable pieces of portable Aztec sculpture, and it contains an unusually complex body of imagery concerning starlore and cosmic battle. The Bilimek Vessel and other Aztec sources reveal that the alcoholic beverage pulque was well integrated into Aztec concepts of warfare and mythology. To the Aztec, pulque was identified with the souls of dead warriors and the starry night sky. The many figures appearing on the Bilimek Vessel represent star beings attacking the sun. At least three and probably four of the depicted deities are identical to the sky bearers appearing in the year-bearer pages of the Codex Borgia (see Seler 1963) and Codex Vaticanus B (see Seler 1902-1903). It is noted that much of the iconography and calendrics appearing on the Bilimek Vessel concerns the completion of the 52-year cycle and the New Fire ceremony, an event that symbolized the cosmic battle between the sun and the fearsome tzitzimime star demons of darkness. The Bilimek Vessel of the Museum für Vólkerkunde in Vienna is a tour de force of Aztec lapidary art (Figure 1). Carved in dark-green phyllite, the vessel is covered with complex icono graphic scenes. Eduard Seler (1902, 1902-1923:11:913-952) was the first to interpret its function and iconographic significance, noting that the imagery concerns the beverage pulque, or octli, the fermented juice of the maguey. In his pioneering analysis, Seler discussed many of the more esoteric aspects of the cult of pulque in ancient highland Mexico. In this study, I address the significance of pulque in Aztec mythology, cosmology, and cal endrics and note that the Bilimek Vessel is a powerful period ending statement pertaining to star gods of the night sky, cosmic battle, and the completion of the Aztec 52-year cycle. THE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE BILIMEK VESSEL The most prominent element on the Bilimek Vessel is the large head projecting from the side of the vase (Figure 2a). Noting the bone jaw and fringe of malinalli grass hair, Seler (1902-1923: 11:916) suggested that the head represents the day sign Malinalli, which for the Aztec frequently appears as a skeletal head with malinalli hair (Figure 2b). However, because the head is not ac companied by the numeral coefficient required for a complete tonalpohualli date, Seler rejected the Malinalli identification. Based on the appearance of the date 8 Flint on the vessel rim, Seler suggested that the face is the day sign Ozomatli, with an inferred tonalpohualli reference to the trecena 1 Ozomatli (1902 1923:11:922-923). However, it is now generally believed that the head is actually the day sign Malinalli (e.g., Klein 1980:162; Nicholson and Keber 1983:62; Pasztory 1983:260; Umberger 1981:120). Moreover, I will suggest later that the Malinalli sign carries a coefficient, in this case the number 1. In his argument for the tentative date of 1 Ozomatli, Seler (1902-1923:11:923) called attention to a damaged but still recon structible date of 8 Tecpatl on the vessel rim. According to Seler, this date alludes to 1 Ozomatli, as it is the eighth day of the Ozomatli trecena. However, Umberger (1981:121) has argued that the date refers to the disastrous flooding of Tenochtitlan during the year of 8 Tecpatl, corresponding to a.d. 1500. How ever, rather than alluding to 1 Ozomatli or the 1500 flood, the 8 Flint date refers directly to maguey. Caso (1959:94) notes that in one of the seventeenth-century Nahuatl chants recorded by Ruiz de Alarcón, maguey is explicitly labeled as chicuetecpacuiat zin, or "Lady 8 Tecpatl" (Coe and Whittaker 1982:172-174). The personification of maguey was the goddess Mayahuel, pa tron of the thirteen-day trecena 1 Malinalli. Just above the protruding Malinalli sign, a 4 Ollin solar disk is partly eclipsed by a spotted device at the lower rim (Figure 3a). Seler (1902-1923:11:921) noted that the spotted portion repre sents the starry night sky, and that in many scenes of pulque gods, there is a similar half-darkened sun (Figure 3c-e). Accord ing to Seler, this device may refer to the dawn or perhaps to the drunkenness and loss of control caused by the drinking of pul que. The Bilimek device differs slightly from the other illus trated examples in that the night portion is curved, much like the outline of the moon during a solar eclipse. In the Telleriano Remensis (see Hamy 1899) representation of a solar eclipse dur ing the year of 4 Tecpatl, the lower portion of the sun is similarly obscured by a curving disk, here marked by a lunar crescent against a field of black (Figure 3b). Rather than refer ring to the dawn, the Bilimek sign probably represents a solar</page><page sequence="2">Taube Figure 1. The Bilimek Pulque Vessel (from Nicholson and Keber 1983: No. 14). eclipse. On each side of the solar device, there are deity figures menacing the sun with staffs and stones. As shown below, these figures are tzitzimime — star demons that threaten to destroy the world during solar eclipses and other periods of darkness.1 In central Mexican thought, pulque was identified with the moon and the night. For example, lunar crescents commonly appear on pulque vessels and as the yacametztli nose pieces worn by pulque gods (Goncalves de Lima 1978; Nicholson 1991: 172). According to the Florentine Codex, the ceremonial drink ing of pulque by old men and women was usually performed at night (Sahagún 1950—1982:IV: 118). The same manuscript also mentions specific festivals involving the nocturnal drinking of pulque (Sahagún 1950-1982:11:21, 95, 110, 168, IV:47). In the Codex Borbonicus (see Nowotny and Durand Forest 1974) il lustration of the trecena 1 Malinalli, dedicated to the pulque goddess Mayahuel, the starry night sky surrounds a pulque pot (Figure 3g). One of the most direct identifications of pulque with night appears on page 25 of the Codex Fejérváry-Mayer (see Burland 1971) (Figure 3f). Here the night portion of the 1 The depiction of tzitzimime star demons attacking the sun recalls pages 23 and 24 of the Maya Codex Paris. Here a series of figures — widely interpreted as constellations (see Love 1993) —are shown attack ing solar eclipse signs. Dicken Everson (personal communication 1991) has pointed out that during total solar eclipses, stars are visible in close proximity to the sun, as if these celestial bodies were menacing the sun. Figure 2. Comparison of face on front of Bilimek Vessel with Aztec Malinalli sign: (a) face on Bilimek Vessel, note malinalli hair (from Seler 1902-1923:11:915); (b) day sign Malinalli, Codex Magliabechiano (Boone 1983). darkened sun is not represented as a body of stars, but instead, as a curving stream of foaming pulque. The Fejérváry-Mayer scene suggests that pulque may have served as a metaphor for the "milky way." Although this remains to be proven, pulque and the night were linked clearly in central Mexican belief. To the ancient Aztec, pulque was also identified with de feated and sacrificed warriors. According to Pasztory (1983: 260), the pulque gods were the patrons of warriors destined for sacrifice. Just before the gladiatorial temalacatl sacrifice, captive warriors were served pulque (Sahagún 1950-1982:11:52). Pulque was widely consumed following the Panquetzaliztli sac rifice of captive warriors (Sahagún 1950-1982:11:148).

The bas-reliefs from the pulque temple of Tepoztecatl at Tepoztlan, Morelos, display explicit references to pulque, war, sacrifice, and the spirit of the dead warrior (Figure 4b; see Seler 1902-1923:111:487-513). According to the Aztec, the souls of sacrificed warriors be came stars personified by the star god Mixcoatl (Nicholson 1971:426; Seler 1963:1:196). In the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas, Mixcoatl-Camaxtli is said to have discovered pulque (Nicholson 1991:160) and, in the same account, this god created the 400 drunken Chichimec that were killed to nourish the sun. Three depictions of Mixcoatl appear on a polychrome olla, possibly for pulque, excavated at the Aztec Templo Mayor (Figure 5a). Mixcoatl, or "cloud serpent" was not simply a star or constellation but seems to have represented the great Milky Way (Beyer 1965:325; Robelo 1980:279). Rather than being en tirely benevolent, Mixcoatl was also identified with the tzitzi mime star demons who dove headlong to the earth during times of darkness. As Seler (1963:1:193) noted, the Telleriano-Remensis and Codex Vaticanus A (see Corona Núñez 1964) specify that the veintena of Mixcoatl, Quecholli, concerned the tzitzimime: "la caída de los demonios que dicen que eran estrellas." In Az tec art, captives destined for sacrifice commonly appear in the guise of Mixcoatl (Figure 5c). Seler (1963:1:196) suggested that the identification of sacri ficed warriors with Mixcoatl corresponds to the mythical epi sode of the newly born Huitzilopochtli slaying Coyolxauhqui and the Centzon Huitznahua, the "400 southerners" (see Saha gún 1950-1982:111:4). According to Seler (1902-1923:11: 967), the killing of the Centzon Huitznahua by Huitzilopochtli de scribes the conquering of the stars by the dawning sun. In other words, the souls of dead warriors and the Centzon Huitznahua represent the forces of night and darkness, the enemies of the solar Huitzilopochtli. The Centzon Huitznahua were conceptually related to the pulque gods known as the Centzon Totochtin, or 400 Rabbits. Along with being identified with pulque and drunkeness, the sign Tochtli, or "rabbit" is the southern year bearer, the obvi ous direction of the Centzon Huitznahua. The Quichean Popol Vuh mentions an episode in which Zipacna slays 400 drunken youths. At their death, these youths were turned into the Pleiades, or Motz in Quiche (Recinos 1950:101). According to Brasseur de Bourborg (cited in Recinos 1950:101), these 400 drunken youths are identical to the pulque gods, the Centzon Totochtin. This episode also relates to the death of the 400 drunken Chichimec mentioned in the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas. Both this account and the Popo! Vuh suggest that along with being the night stars, the Centzon Huitznahua are also gods of drunkenness, that is, the Centzon Totochtin. The Huitzilopochtli side of the Templo Mayor contains strong contextual evidence that the Aztec equated the Centzon Totochtin with the Centzton Huitznahua. The Templo Mayor greenstone figure representing a pulque goddess and Ome Tochtli —the generic name of the 400 pulque gods —was discov ered in direct association with the famed relief of Coyolxauh qui, the sister and leader of the Centzon Huitznahua (Figure 6; Pasztory 1983:155-157). Accompanying the Stage IVb sculp tures of Coyolxauhqui and the greenstone pulque goddess, Of fertory Cache 6 contained a seated stone image of a pulque god, complete with the square ear ornaments, yacameztli nose piece, and pointed headdress often found with pulque gods (see Nich olson and Keber 1983:No. 27). Eight standing male sculptures were discovered leaning against the base of the earlier Stage III Huitzilopochtli temple stairs (Matos Moctezuma 1988:Color Plate 9, Illustrations 112-113). Matos Moctezuma (1988:73) sug gests that these figures represent the defeated Centzon Huitz nahua. With their pointed headdresses, square ear ornaments and frequent nose pieces, the figures are notably similar to the</page><page sequence="4">Taube Figure 4.

Six of the eight standing pulque gods are standard bearers with the right arm upraised, and very closely resemble Monument 1 from Poza Larga, Veracruz. This monument also represents a standard bearer with the yacametztli nose piece, square ear ornaments, and pointed crown (see Soli's 1981:Plate 56). The chest of this figure bears the date Ome Tochtli, the sign of the Centzon Totochtin. Like the later Coyolxauhqui relief, the eight sculptures from the Phase III temple steps represent the defeated enemies of Huitzilopochtli, here as the Centzon Totochtin. The reverse side of the Bilimek Vessel displays a goddess of fearsome aspect (Figures 7 and 8a). Appearing with jaguar hands and feet, she clutches a pair of personified flint blades in her taloned hands. The sunken eyes, crenelated nose, and ex posed teeth denote that she is at least partly skeletalized. The position of her head — inverted but facing frontally —suggests decapitation (Seler 1902-1923:11:946). A pair of Xiuhcoatl fire serpents displaying the attributes of the atl-tlachinolli fire sign appear to originate from her loins (Figures 7 and 9a). Snake attributes may also be seen in her skirt, which is fringed with serpent heads. Because of the serpent skirt, Seler (1902) identified the Bilimek goddess as Coatlicue, or She of the Serpent Skirt. However, al though Seler noted the pulque vessel between her outstretched legs (Figure 10), he missed an especially important detail. Nich olson and Keber (1983:62) point out that two streams of liquid squirt from the hanging breasts of the goddess into the pulque pot below, illustrating that the viscous white pulque is her milk. In central Mexican thought, pulque is closely identified with the milk of women. According to one Aztec cure for eye worms, either the drops of pulque or women's milk were to be placed in the eyes (Sahagún 1950-1982:X:144). The Vaticanus A describes Mayahuel, the goddess of pulque and the trecena 1 Malinalli, as having virtually innumerable breasts; una señora que tenia cuatrocientos tetas (Corona Núñez 1964:3:74). According to the Histoire du mechique, the grandmother and guardian of Mayahuel was the paramount leader of the tzitzimime, the star demons who threaten humanity with universal destruction (Gar ibay 1965:107). The Bilimek figure represents the pulque god dess as a devouring, beastlike tzitzimitl. The Bilimek goddess corresponds to descriptions and depic tions of tzitzimime. According to the Códice Zumárraga (cited in Robelo 1980:709), the tzitzimime were sky-dwelling skeletal</page><page sequence="5">The Bilimek Pulque Vessel Figure 5. The deity Mixcoati and captive warriors destined for sacrifice: (a) Mixcoati, detail of polychrome olla excavated at the Templo Mayor (af ter Seler 1902-1923:11:866); (b) Mixcoati, Codex Magliabechiano (after Seler 1963:l:Figure 448); (c) sacrificial captives, Codex Telleriano-Remensis (after Seler 1963:l:Figure 454a-b). women, recalling the skeletal face of the Bilimek figure. The Codex Magliabechiano (see Boone 1983) provides an excellent depiction of an explicitly labeled tzitzimitl (Figure 8c). The fig ure appears as a taloned skeletal woman with a snake emerging from her loins. Although in this scene only one snake is illus trated, this may not differ from the pair of snakes found with the Bilimek figure. In Nahuatl, the term coatl refers to "twin" as well as "snake" (Simeón 1977:115). Among the ancient Mex icans, twins were considered with a horror accorded to a mon strous birth, and it is possible that the serpents allude to this fearsome condition. Supplied with paper banners and curling hair, the head of the Bilimek figure is quite similar to that of the Magliabechiano tzitzimitl. One of the best known times for the appearance of the tzit zimime was during the vigil marking the end of the 52-year cy cle (see Sahagún 1950—1982:VII:27). A stone representation of the xiuhmolpilli year bundle for the 52-year cycle depicts a tzit zimitl as a spider descending from the night sky (Moedano Koer 1951:Figure 1). Immediately below the spider, there is the head of a skeletalized goddess much like that appearing on the Bili mek Vessel (Figure 8b). Like the Bilimek and Magliabechiano figures, the entity displays twisted hair, paper banners, and pa per ear pendants. Although Moedano Kóer (1951:106) identi fied this figure as Mictlantecuhtli, Nicholson (cited in Nicholson and Keber 1983:45) considers it a tzitzimitl. The xiuhmolpilli en tity is probably a tzitzimitl as the aged earth and death goddess b Figure 6.

Bas-relief scene on back of Bilimek Vessel (composite after Seler 1902-1923:11:932-933, 944). known by such epithets as Ilamatecuhtli, CihuacoatI, and Quilaztli. Caso (1940) noted that Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl plays an important role in the Codex Borbonicus illustration of the burial of the year bundles during the month of Tititl (Figures 8d and 9b). In one Aztec song, CihuacoatI, or "serpent woman," is referred to as a female warrior and war goddess (Seler 1902 1923:11:1048-1051). It will be recalled that a pair of atl-tlachinolli war serpents emerge from the loins of the Bilimek figure. Ac cording to Durán (1971:210), CihuacoatI is identical to Quilaztli. Along with being a goddess of twin births, Quilaztli was also referred to as a tzitzimicihuatl, or "woman tzitzimitl" (Robelo 1980:85, 449). Klein (1980:162) notes that the Bilimek figure closely resembles Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl. This identification is probably correct, although the figure is also a monstrous, devouring tzitzimitl. Cecelia Klein (personal communication 1991) suggests that the Bilimek pulque goddess is the same entity represented on the aforementioned greenstone sculpture discovered at the Templo Mayor (Figure 6a). Although López Austin (1979) identified the figure as Mayahuel, Klein (1990) notes that she is probably the demonic tzitzimitl grandmother of Mayahuel. This female figure probably represents Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl. Like the Bilimek figure, the greenstone goddess has a fleshless mouth and paper banners in her hair. The band of stars running along the edge of her skirt corresponds to the dress of Ilamatecuhtli Cihuacoatl who, according to Sahagún (1950-1982:11:155), wore a "starry skirt," or citlalli icue. A smaller figure appears on the upper abdomen of the green stone goddess (Figure 6b). López Austin (1979) notes that this represents the well-known pulque god Ome Tochtli, or 2 Rab bit. Thus the figure not only displays the characteristic nose piece and headdress of the pulque gods, but is also accompa nied by the name 2 Rabbit. Nonetheless, the figure displays two unusual characteristics, these being the outstretched position of the arms and the form of the lower body, which is rendered as the Mexican sign for "stone." It will be subsequently noted that both the hand positioning and the reference to stone probably refer to tzitzimime, here as diving gods of castigation. On the upper sides of the Bilimek Vessel, facing out from the central pulque goddess, is a series of eight anthropomorphic beings (Figure 7). It has been mentioned that two of these fig ures appear to be menacing the eclipsed sun. The other six figures also face the sun; together, they probably represent an army of tzitzimime star demons attacking the sun. The major ity of these figures are accompanied by lines of circular elements that have generally been interpreted as numerical coefficients. Based on his incorrect interpretation of the projecting Malinalli head as the date 1 Ozomatli, Seler (1902-1923:11:929) inter preted the circles as referring to dates occurring in the trecena of 1 Ozomatli. According to Seler, these reconstructed dates</page><page sequence="7">The Bilimek Pulque Vessel Figure 8.

However, aside from the fact that the projecting face does not refer to 1 Ozomatli, there is no reason why the requisite day names are not illustrated. I suggest later that rather than being coef ficients, these lines of circles probably have an entirely differ ent meaning. Four of the eight figures hold stones and wooden staffs in their hands (Figures llc-e, 12c). Seler (1902-1923:11:934) noted that this corresponds to the Nahuatl expression tetl-cuahuitl, or "wood and stone," a reference to castigation. Two of the staff and stone wielders wear the yacametztli nose piece, identifying them as pulque gods (Figures 1 lc-d). Their circular eyes resem ble those of the rabbit, or tochtli, and one of the figures clearly supports a pair of rabbit ears (Figure lid). In costume, these figures are very similar to the representation of Ome Tochtli upon the greenstone goddess (Figure 6). However, in this case, the stone sign for castigation is not held in the hand, but forms the body of the god. Considering the vices and dangers that the Aztecs associated with pulque (see Sahagún 1950-1982:VI:68 71), it is entirely appropriate that these pulque gods are depicted as gods of punishment.2 Directly below the two pulque gods, a pair of small diving fig ures wear conical paper elements upon their backs (Figure 13a). Both hold probable weapons in their outstretched hands, and horizontal facial banding can be discerned on the lower figure. According to Seler (1902:342), these figures represent the tzit zimime star demons who descend headfirst from the heavens to 2 During the drinking that followed the Panquetzaliztli sacrifice of captive warriors, the leaders of the telpochcalti drank pulque in secrecy. If they were caught, they were struck with sticks and stones, the same weapons held by the Bilimek figures (Sahagún 1950-1982:11:148).</page><page sequence="8">Taube Figure 9.

They are notably similar to an entity appear ing on a greenstone pectoral from the Huitzilopochtli side of the Aztec Templo Mayor (Figure 13b). Like the Bilimek pair, the entity has a banded face, wields weapons, wears the conical pa per back element, and has his hair pulled into two hornlike pro jections.3 This pectoral was found in the same cist containing the greenstone sculpture of the skeletal goddess and Ome Tochtli (Figure 6). The other side of the vessel depicts a figure wearing a head dress similar to that of the pair of pulque gods (Figure lie). However, in this case he has the cut shell oyohualli pendant and the tasseled loincloth found with a dancing figure on page 52 of the Vaticanus B (Seler 1902-1903). Accordingly, Seler (1902 1923:11:945) suggests that this entity is a god of dance. Aside from his particular dress, he seems to be bearded and has a smoking element, probably a cigar, projecting from his mouth. This figure is clearly part rabbit, and displays the long ears, round eye, buck teeth, and lolling tongue frequently found with Aztec representations of rabbits (Figure lla-b). The final three figures near the upper rim of the vessel are well-known Aztec gods (Figure 12). On the vessel side display Figure 10. Pulque streams pouring from breasts of Bilimek goddess into pulque pot (after Seler 1902-1923:11:944). ing the pulque gods and descending tzitzimime, an entity wields a burning Xiuhcoatl fire serpent (Figure 12a). Because of the Xiuhcoatl and the projecting pair of fire sticks in the headdress, Seler (1902-1923:11:932) correctly identified this as Xiuhtecuhtli, the god of fire. The corresponding figure on the other side of the great pulque goddess is skeletal and wields a shield and spearthrower; a smoking star sign appears prominently dis played on the abdomen (Figure 12b). Seler (1902-1923:11:942) noted that this is Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the atlatl-wielding god of the morning star. The third and final figure holds the stone and wooden staff associated with the dance and pulque gods (Figure 14a). The entity wears a mammalian headdress, prob ably a rabbit. Although Seler (1902-1923:11:944-945) noted that the figure displays the prominent cut-conch, "wind-jewel" pec toral of Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, he neglected to point out the char acteristically billed face of Ehecatl projecting out the headdress. Based on the Ehecatl face and shell pectoral, this figure can be securely identified as Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl. THE BILIMEK VESSEL AND THE 52-YEAR CYCLE The night vigil marking the end of a 52-year cycle constituted one of the most dramatic and renowned rites of the ancient Az tec. Occurring during the month of Panquetzaliztli in the year of 2 Acatl, this was the New Fire ceremony known as the "bind ing of the years," toxiuhmolpia. An important element of the New Fire rites was the making of a faggot bundle, with each stick representing a year in the 52-year cycle (Figure 9b). Two such xiuhmolpilli bundles appear on the Bilimek Vessel, emanat ing from the mouths of the Xiuhcoatl serpent pair (Figure 9a). One bundle is clearly marked with the xiuhitl turquoise quin cunx, identifying it as a xiuhmolpilli year bundle. The Bilimek bundles are paired with gouts of water, and together, the burn ing bundles and water refer to atl-tlachinolli, or war. However, this use of burning year bundles to allude to the fire aspect of atl-tlachinolli is unique. The appearance of year bundles on the Bilimek Vessel concerns more than simply war. It will be seen that this vase contains other references to the completion of the 52-year cycle. The primary and most frequently cited account of the Aztec New Fire ceremony appears in the Florentine Codex (Sahagún 3 The figure holds the netted hunting bag of Mixcoatl-Camaxtli, and it is possible that this tzitzimitl is portrayed as a combination of Mix coatl and Tezcatlipoca.</page><page sequence="9">The Bilimek Pulque Vessel a 0' ,© c d. d © Figure 11.

Important passages also appear in two pre Hispanic screenfolds, the Borgia (pages 49-52) and Vaticanus B (pages 17-23) codices. In the Borgia passage, the 20 day names are grouped according to the four directions, with particular trees, gods, and temples associated with each direction. Both Seler (1963:11:101) and Thompson (1934) mentioned that the four scenes beginning on Borgia page 49 are notably similar to the well-known New Year pages appearing in the Postclassic Maya Codex Dresden (see Thompson 1972). Pages 25-28 por tray representations of specific trees, gods, and temples oriented to the glyphs of the four directions. The succession of four year bearer days beginning the new year is repeated 13 times on each Dresden page, thus providing an entire round of 52 years. In the Dresden New Year pages, the day preceding the year bearer is also represented 13 times. Beginning on page 25, the day sign Eb precedes the year bearer Ben, the day Caban before Edznab, Ik before Akbal, and finally, Chicchan before the year bearer Lamat on page 28. In the cited Borgia and Vaticanus B passages, the year bearer and preceding day are also carefully delineated. In the upper right corner of Borgia page 49, a sky bearer stands atop the Mexican year bearer Acatl, correspond ing to the east (Figure 15). The preceding day Malinalli is placed in the night sky directly above. Beginning on page 49, the or der runs as follows: Malinalli to Acatl, Ollin to Tecpatl, Ehecatl to Calli, and finally, Mazatl to Tochtli. Precisely the same pat tern appears with the sky bearers illustrated on pages 19-22 of the Vaticanus B. It is especially noteworthy that these day names correspond entirely to those appearing in the Dresden New Year pages. Thus the day sign Malinalli is equivalent to Eb, Acatl to Ben, and so on. In other words, in both the Mexican and Dres den manuscripts, Malinalli or Eb is depicted before the first and eastern year bearer. The day immediately preceding the new year bearer proba bly had special import as it not only corresponds to the last day of the old year, but also appears in the same cardinal direc</page><page sequence="10">10 Taube Figure 13.

With the appearance of the year bearer Acatl, the annual as well as day direction shifts from the south to the east. The sky bearers illustrated in the Borgia and Vatica nus B codices may well illustrate this climactic shifting of world directions and associations at the onset of the new year. In view of the placement of the preceding day in the night sky, the Bor gia and Vaticanus B sky-bearer scenes may refer to a night vigil, quite like that recorded for the end of the 52-year cycle. In this regard, it should be noted that both the contact-period Yucatec and contemporary highland Maya mark the appearance of the new year bearer with a night vigil (Barrera Vásquez 1965:72; de la Garza 1983:11:37; Oakes 1951:99; Tedlock 1982:99-100). In the Borgia year-bearer pages, there are other scenes that recall the Aztec New Fire ceremony. At the bottom right of each page, an individual drills new fire, an important component of the Aztec New Fire ceremony. Seler (1963:11:97) compared these scenes to an episode in the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas. After the heavens and stars were created, Tezcatlipoca in the guise of Mixcoatl fashioned new fire in the year of 2 Acatl; the text states that this was the origin of the New Fire ceremony (Garibay 1965:33; Nicholson 1971:400). As in the case of the suggested annual night vigil, the appearance of the New Fire rite in the Borgia year-bearer pages implies that the making of new fire may not have been limited to only the 52-year ceremony but was a common component of Mexican new-year ceremonies.5 In each of the Borgia year-bearer pages, a pair of descend ing figures appear immediately above the fire-making scene (Figure 13c). In their hands, they carry such symbols as the tetl cuahuitl castigation sign, the cord of strangulation, weapons, and the atl-tlachinolli sign for war. In other words these beings appear as agents of divine castigation. The diving figures are clearly analogous to the tzitzimitl pair appearing on the Bilimek Vessel. Although making no mention of the Bilimek examples, Seler (1963:11:96) also identified the Borgia figures as tzitzi mime. The hand positions of the Borgia examples are identical to the greenstone representation of Ome Tochtli, probably also rendered as a tzitzimitl (Figure 6). Seler (1963:11:96-97) noted that the descending male figures in the Borgia year-bearer pages are identical to the series of male gods represented on the immediately preceding pages 47 and 4 For the Postclassic Yucatec Maya, there is abundant evidence that the year was named after the appearance of the year bearer on the first day of the year, or 1 Pop. However, Caso (1969:59) suggested that for the Aztec, the year was named by the occurrence of the year bearer on the final day of the last 20-day month, in other words, the day imme diately before the five-day nemontemi (Broda de Casas 1969:35-36). Nicholson (cited in Nicholson and Keber 1983:45) noted that the stone xiuhmolipilli bundle published by Moedano Kóer (1951) provides sup port for the Caso interpretation. Thus, the date appearing on the bun dle, 1 Acatl, corresponds in the Caso system to the final day of the veintena Panquetzaliztli for the year 2 Acatl. However, there is no in dication that the Aztec system was used in the Borgia and Vaticanus B codices. In the present discussion of the Borgia and Vaticanus B, I will follow the Yucatec Maya system of the year being named by the appear ance of the year bearer on the first of the year. 5 Landa (in Tozzer 1941:152-153) mentions that the ancient Yucatec Maya performed an annual New Fire ceremony at the installation of the 365-day year. Song 12 of the colonial Yucatec Cantares de Dzitbalchede scribes the seating of the new 365-day year. The song refers to the ex tinction of the old fire along with mentioning a night vigil (Barrera Vásquez 1965:71-73).</page><page sequence="11">The Bilimek Pulque Vessel 11 Figure 14.

On page 48, the fifth green-painted figure is accompanied by a symbol of corn. Although not represented as a diving god on the four following year-bearer pages, the fig ure lets blood in front of a great maize plant on page 53, the final portion of the year-bearer passage (Figure 13e). This green individual is also in the bottom left corner of the preceding page 52, corresponding to the final southern year bearer Tochtli. In this case, he is explicitly named Macuilmalinalli, or 5 Grass (Fig ure 13d). Clearly, the five gods appearing on Borgia pages 47 and 48 are inextricably linked to the following year-bearer passage. Seler (1963:11:63) identified the five figures on Borgia pages 47 and 48 as the ahuiateteo, gods of excess pleasure and atten dant punishment. Each of these five gods is named by the co efficient of five, or macuil. Seler (1963:11:76) noted that for the Aztec, the number 5 signified excess, and in support cited the Florentine Codex account in which a Huastec king consumed 6Seler (1963:11:96) also noted that the female figures accompany ing the diving ahuiateteo on Borgia pages 49-52 correspond to the five female cihuateteo illustrated on pages 47 and 48. However, although the diving females do probably also refer to cihuateteo, the correspondences between the two groups of ahuiateteo are far more developed. For ex ample, the cihuateteo on pages 47 and 48 lack the symbols of castiga tion wielded by the diving women on pages 49-52.</page><page sequence="12">12 Taube KAT" Figure 15. Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli as sky bearer associated with eastern year bearer Acatl, note Malinalli day sign in night sky, Codex Borgia, page 49. a fifth cup of pulque, causing him to become shamefully drunk (Sahagún 1950-1982:X:193). Beginning with the first on page 47, the ahuiateteo are calendrically named as follows: Macuil cuetzpalin (5 Lizard), Macuilcozcacuahtli (5 Vulture), Macuil tochtli (5 Rabbit), Macuilxochitl (5 Flower), and finally, Macuilmalinalli (5 Grass). Seler (1963:11:63) noted that the sec ond portion of the calendrical names also have something in common: all five of the day names correspond to the direction south. In addition, they also occur in the five southern trecenas of 1 Xóchitl, 1 Malinalli, 1 Cuetzpalin, 1 Cozcacuauhtli, and 1 Tochtli. Thus, along with being gods of drunkenness, dance, and sexuality, the ahuiateteo were also identified with the south. In view of the symbols of castigation in their hands, the Bilimek pair can best be identified as tzitzimime demons in the form of punishing ahuiateteo. To the ancient Aztec, the tzitzimime were greatly feared star beings that dove to the earth at certain astronomical and calen drical events: The Tzitzimime were stars, constellations, or planets in the heavens, who were considered under certain circumstances to be baneful. During eclipses of the sun, they were believed to descend headlong to earth to devour human beings; in other words, they were considered to be visible through the darkening of the heavens. (Thompson 1934:231) It has been noted that the eight tzitzimime figures on the upper portion of Bilimek Vessel are attacking the partially eclipsed sun. To the Aztec, solar eclipses were related thematically to another event, the night vigil marking the end of a 52-year cycle. In the Vaticanus A and Telleriano-Remensis illustrations of the 2 Acatl New Fire event of 1507, a solar-eclipse sign is promi nently displayed. Rather than being limited to only solar eclipses, the tzitzimime could also appear during the New Fire vigil. Ac cording to Sahagún (1950-1982:VII:27), the tzitzimime would descend if new fire was not created on the hill of the star: It was claimed that if fire could not be drawn, then [the sun] would be destroyed forever; all would be ended; there would evermore be night. Nevermore would the sun come forth. Night would prevail forever, and the demons of darkness [tzitzimime] would descend, to eat men. Rather than referring to an eclipse of the sun, the tzitzimime appearing on the Bilimek Vessel and Borgia scenes concern calendrical-period endings, the completion of the vague year and the 52-year cycle. Seler (1902-1903:89-90, 1963:11:105) first mentioned that the sky bearers appearing in the Borgia and Vaticanus B codices probably refer to stars and constellations that descend to earth in the form of tzitzimime. In support, Seler cited the Crónica mexicana of Tezozomoc, which refers to the Tzitzimimec Ilhui catzitzquique, the angeles de aire, sostenadores del cielo. Seler (1902-1903:85-88) noted that the series of sky bearers appear ing in the Borgia and Vaticanus B are virtually identical. Begin ning with the year bearer Acatl, Seler identified the sky bearers as follows: Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, Huitzilopochtli, Ehecatl, and finally, Mictlantecuhtli with the year bearer Tochtli. Thompson (1934) essentially agreed with these identifications, although he noted that the figure appearing with the year bearer Tecpatl bears no clear attributes of Huitzilopochtli. Thompson (1934: 217) identified this god as a rare representation of Otontecuhtli. However, this deity is not Otontecuhtli but the god of fire, Xiuhtecuhtli. In fact, Seler (1963:11:107) noted that the being displays the attributes of Xiuhtecuhtli. However, because of the blue coloring of the Borgia example, Seler argued that the fig ure represented the fire god in the form of Huitzilopochtli. Body coloring alone is not a reliable criterion for deity identification. In the Borgia, Xiuhtecuhtli appears with a wide variety of fa cial patterning and body coloration. For example, in the upper right corner of Borgia page 46, Xiuhtecuhtli is also depicted with a blue body. Although unnoticed by Seler and subsequent researchers, the Bilimek Vessel depicts at least three and probably four of the sky bearers appearing in the Borgia and Vaticanus B codices. Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli and Xiuhtecuhtli, corresponding to the year bearer Acatl and Tecpatl, flank the head of the pulque god dess (Figures 7, 12a-b). Ehecatl, god of the third and western year bearer Calli, appears in front of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, as if to menace the half-darkened sun appearing on the front of the vessel (Figure 12c). Three of the four codical sky bearers are clearly delineated on the Bilimek Vessel; however, there remains the sky bearer Mictlantecuhtli, corresponding to the fourth and final year bearer Tochtli, the sign of the south. In view of the calendrics upon the Bilimek Vessel, the skeletal death god should have an especially prominent position. The date 1 Tochtli actually appears on the front of the Bilimek Vessel, here marking the ab domen of the Tlaltecuhtli earth monster placed at the vessel base (Figure 1 la). According to the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas, the earth was fashioned in the year 1 Tochtli, the year immediately before the first New Fire ceremony held in the year of 2 Acatl (Garibay 1965:32-33; Nicholson 1971:400). It will be recalled that the day name Malinalli is displayed prom inently at the front of the vessel (Figures 1 and 2). Along with Tochtli, Malinalli is a southern day sign. Moreover, as we have observed in the Borgia and Vaticanus B sky-bearer scenes, Malinalli is the day immediately prior to the eastern year bearer Acatl. At first appearance, the Malinalli sign on the Bilimek Ves sel is an anomaly in Mesoamerican calendrical notation. To have calendrical meaning, the day sign must be accompanied</page><page sequence="13">The Bilimek Pulque Vessel with a numerical coefficient. It will be recalled that the date of 8 Flint appearing on the vessel rim refers to Mayahuel, the god dess of maguey. I strongly suspect that the great Malinalli sign forms part of the reference to the day 1 Malinalli, the specific trecena of Mayahuel. If this is correct, where is the necessary coefficient of 1? There are two possible, mutually exclusive references to a coefficient of 1 above the Malinalli sign. Seler (1902-1923:11:951-952) called attention to a perforated area at the central crest of the Malinalli hair (Figure 1). According to Seler, this cavity may have held an inlay. A disk of shell, metal or other material placed in this circular depression may well have served as the coefficient of 1. Another, albeit less likely, possibility is the solar disk appearing immediately above. As the numeral 1, this disk would correspond well proportionally to the size of the Malinalli day sign. The dual use of the solar sign as a reference to the number 1 would not be entirely unique in Az tec calendrics. Similar visual punning may be observed on the Calendar Stone, in which the four lobes of the central Ollin sign refer simultaneously to the four previous creations. At present, the sunken region or the solar disk cannot be confidently iden tified as the coefficient of 1. Nonetheless, the day 1 Malinalli would have special significance for the Bilimek Vessel. Not only is 1 Malinalli the trecena of Mayahuel, but it is also the day im mediately preceding the day naming the year 2 Acatl, the year in which the New Fire rites were performed. Moreover, for the year of 2 Acatl, 1 Malinalli appears as the second to the last day of Tititl, the veintena of Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl. With the pair of ahuiateteo figures and the prominent ref erences to the southern day names Tochtli and Malinalli, the Bilimek Vessel appears to correspond to this direction. The skeletal goddess splayed across the back of the vessel probably refers to the death god as the southern sky bearer (Figure 7). However, rather than representing Mictlantecuhtli, this figure depicts his female counterpart in the form of Ilamatecuhtli Cihuacoatl. Klein (1980:162) notes that the female consort of Mictlantecuhtli, Micticacihuatl, is "essentially identical to Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl." According to Veytia, one aspect of Cihuacoatl was Teoyaominqui, diosa que recoge las almas de los difuntos (Robelo 1980:85). This identification with the souls of the dead is also found in the Codex Magliabechiano, which describes the Cihuacoatl ceremony held during Tititl as the cel ebration of the dead (la fiesta de los finados). In the Magliabechiano description of the Tititl celebration, Cihuacoatl wears a pair of personified flints in her headdress (Figure 14a). These blades recall the pair of flints held in the hands of the Bilimek figure. Another depiction of a goddess with flints in her hands appears on Borgia page 18, here in a scene of darkness accompanied by the five southern day names (Figure 14c). The figure displays a skeletal mouth and the char acteristic headdress of Mictlantecuhtli. According to Seler (1963: 1:220), the figure represents the consort of Mictlantecuhtli, who also appears facing her in the same scene. In between the two death gods, there is a pair of diving birds, which Seler identi fied as tzitzimime. Like the Borgia scene, the Bilimek Vessel represents the flint-wielding figure as a goddess of death and darkness. To the ancient Aztec, Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl was identi fied with the forces of night. The underside lid of the Hackmack Box displays a star-rimmed medallion containing a skeletal head (Figure 14b). Noting the pair of flint blades in the headdress, Seler (1902-1923:1:742) identified the figure as Ilamatecuhtli Cihuacoatl. Seler noted that the name of her "starry skirt," citlalli icue, is also an Aztec term for the Milky Way. Thus according to Seler, Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl may have person ified the Milky Way. It is noteworthy that in one Aztec song, Cihuacoatl is described as the mother of MixcoatI, another god of the Milky Way (Seler 1902-1923:11:1049). The continually darkened temple of Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl was termed tlillan, meaning "darkness" (Durán 1971:211). Sahagún (1950-1982: 11:182) mentioned that the Tlillan Calmecac was the residence of the "guardians of Cihuacoatl." Nicholson (cited in Couch 1985:84-85) argues that the temple prominently displayed in the Borbonicus New Fire scene represents Tlillan Calmecac, that is, the temple precinct of Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl. Caso (1940) noted that Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl played an major role in the burial of the year bundles during the 2 Acatl veintena month of Tititl. However, because of her association with forces of death and darkness, Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl may have also been an important and feared figure during the New Fire vigil of Panquetzaliztli. During this rite, great atten tion was paid to the creation of fire upon Huixachtlan, or Hill of the Star (Sahagún 1950—1982: VII:25). This mountain is located due south of Tenochtitlan—that is, residents of the capital would be looking directly toward the southern night sky during the New Fire rites. This southern region not only corresponded to the Centzon Huitznahua, or "400 southerners" but also to Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl. According to Durán (1971:210), Ci huacoatl was the patron of the southern city of Xochimilco. On the Bilimek Vessel, the figure corresponding to the south ern sky bearer is represented as Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl, a goddess identified with war, death, the starry night, and the completion of the 52-year cycle. The appearance of this south ern figure with the other three sky bearers suggests that a great deal of the imagery appearing on the vessel concerns the starry firmament. This identification with night and darkness is repre sented by the eclipsed sun appearing on the front of the vessel. However, the sky bearers constitute an even stronger allusion to the night sky. As noted earlier, the Aztec regarded the sky bearers as stars and constellations that threatened to descend in the form of tzitzimime demons. In other words, the group of sky-bearer figures probably refers to celestial bodies observable in the night sky. Mention has been made of the series of circles appearing amidst the weapon-wielding tzitzimime star demons (Figure 7). Rather than being coefficients, these lines of dots could well refer to constellations (Figures 7, 16b). Thus, in the illustrations of constellations in the Primeros memoriales (Paso y Troncoso 1905:65-66), the stars are similarly marked as pairs of concentric circles (Figure 16a). The figures and dots on the Bilimek Vessel could well constitute a form of star chart describ ing some of the prominent celestial denizens of the night. CONCLUSIONS Far more than simply an intoxicating beverage, pulque consti tuted an integral part of Aztec concepts of warfare and cosmol ogy. In this study, I have argued that pulque was identified with the souls of dead warriors and the starry night sky. The Bilimek Pulque Vessel contains graphic illustrations of some of the prominent tzitzimime star beings of central Mexican thought. Considering the Histoire du mechigue account of Mayahuel and her tzitzimitl grandmother, it is entirely appropriate that this vessel be filled with scenes of star beings. The Bilimek Vessel contains a great deal of iconography pertaining to the comple tion of the 52-year cycle. Along with representing the dreaded</page><page sequence="14">Taube Figure 16. Comparison of Aztec constellations with circular elements on Bilimek Vessel: (a) depictions of constellations from the Primeros memori ales (after Paso y Troncoso 1905:65-66); (b) possible star groups on Bili mek Vessel (see Figure 4). tzitzimime, the vessel depicts a pair of year bundles. In addition, many of the Bilimek scenes can be correlated with the year bearer pages in the Borgia and Vaticanus B codices. Accord ingly, the diving tzitzimime pair of ahuiateteo appearing on the Bilimek Vessel have clear analogues with all four Borgia year bearer pages. An even more striking parallel is the series of four sky bearers appearing in the Borgia and Vaticanus B codices. The codical sky bearers Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, Xiuhtecuhtli, and Ehecatl are clearly depicted on the Bilimek Vessel. Moreover, it has been suggested that the skeletal sky bearer of the south is depicted by the principal goddess splayed across the back of the vessel. Displayed with long streams of white pulque pour ing from her breasts, this figure may represent the Milky Way, possibly as the great mother of the tzitzimime star demons. A goddess closely identified with death and darkness, Ilamate cuhtli-Cihuacoatl played an important role in the ceremonies pertaining to the completion of the 52-year cycle. The two dates appearing on the front of the Bilimek Vessel probably pertain to the completion of the 52-year cycle. Thus, the year 1 Tochtli constitutes the last year of the 52-year cycle whereas the reconstructed date of 1 Malinalli corresponds not only to the trecena of Mayahuel, but also to the day immedi ately preceding 2 Acatl, the first year of the 52-year cycle. Both Malinalli and Tochtli are southern day signs. In the Borgia and Vaticanus B year-bearer pages, the southern year bearer Tochtli is the last of the series, like its Maya equivalent Lamat in the Codex Dresden. Moreover, in the Borgia and Vaticanus B, the sky bearer is Mictlantecuhtli, a clear reference to death and com pletion. In like manner, the Bilimek Vessel depicts the forces of death and castigation appearing in the night sky as tzitzimime. This vessel embodies the celestial enemies of Huitzilopochtli, the demons of darkness who threaten to reappear for cosmic battle every 52 years during the New Fire vigil. RESUMEN En este análisis de la vasija Bilimek, se nota que el pulque tenía un papel íntegro respecto a los conceptos aztecos de la guerra y cosmología; esta bebida se identificó con los almas de los guerreros muertos, y con el cielo estrellado de la noche. La vasija de pulque Bilimek lleva ilustraciones gráficas de algunos personajes estelares (tzitzimime) más importantes de la ideología de México central. La iconografía y los datos caléndricos que aparecen en la vasija Bilimek se relacionan con la ceremonia del Fuego Nuevo y con el fin del ciclo de 52 años. Muchas de las figuras de la vasija Bilimek se pueden correlacionar con las páginas de portadores de años que se encuentran en los códices Borgia y Vaticanus B. De los cuatro sostenedores del cielo que apare cen en las páginas de portadores de años del Borgia y del Vaticanus B, se encuentran por lo menos tres y probablemente todos los cuatro representados en la vasija Biliraek. Los sostenedores del cielo Xiuhtecuhtli, Ehecatl, y Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli que aparecen en los dos códices son claramente presentes en la vasija Bilimek. Además, parece que el sostenedor del cielo descarnado del sur se representa por medio de la diosa principal, quien esta extendida en cruz en la parte posterior de la vasija. Se sugiere que este personaje representa a la gran diosa Ilamatecuhtli-Cihuacoatl, una personificación de la Vía Láctia. La vasija Bilimek describe las fuerzas de la muerte y del castigo que aparecen como tzitzimime en el cielo nocturno. Esta vasija les da cuerpo a los enemigos celestes de Huitzilopochtli, los demonios de las tinieblas quienes amenacen reaparecerse para la batalla cósmica cada 52 años durante la ceremonia del Fuego Nuevo.
