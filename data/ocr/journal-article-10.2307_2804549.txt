Blood- sucking witchcraft, an epistemological study of anthropomorphic supernaturalism in rural Tlax- tala. xxii, 476 pp., tables, bibliogr. Tucson, London: Univ. of Arizona Press, 1993. $40.00 This appears to be the first detailed monograph published in English devoted entirely to an in- tensive analysis of 'witchcraft' beliefs in a Mesoamerican rural area. It provides a wealth of ethnographic information. The authors claim that theirs is a new approach to the in- vestigation of how to analyse such beliefs in the supernatural as well as how to approach the difficult problem of determining the ways such beliefs give way to more naturalistic explana- tions of misfortune. The writers draw their material from Indian communities in central Mexico (Tlaxcala) studied by Nutini for a remarkably long period (1959-1988). The most striking aspect of the material is its quantitative richness: census ma- terial from over a thousand households involv- ing over 1,300 cases of death from witchcraft, as well as nearly fifty cases reported in great de- tail regarding physical condition of the de- ceased, circumstances surrounding the discovery of the body, age, sex and birth order of the victim, acculturation, household compo- sition, time of day and season of death, physi- ological and psychological difficulties of mourners, and many others features. They also provide many valuable statements by inform- ants (in both Spanish and English translation) about how they perceive and explain these events. I know of no accounts of purported witchcraft deaths providing so many data. The nature of Tlaxcala witchcraft beliefs allows this in ways impossible for areas such as Africa or historic Europe or New England. Real persons are almost never named or accused of witch- craft, even though in the 1960s about 20 per cent. of all infant deaths in Tlaxcala were cred- ited to such causes. It does not even appear to be the case that those suspected of being witches are hated and blamed in the lethal ways associated with many African and Euro- pean societies. Tlaxcala witches are usually women and are thought to transform themselves into various inhuman forms, especially turkeys, in order to enter homes to suck the blood of infants be- tween the ages of three and ten months. Far more victims are female than male, and deaths prevail in the cold, rainy season. Most of these deaths in fact appear due to asphyxiation and involve maternal carelessness associated with nursing and tending during the late hours of the night (when witches are thought most likely to strike). We learn that male infants re- ceive far more conscientious maternal atten- tions than do females and that conditions during the cold season favour heavy blanketing and bodily closeness prompting smothering. The beliefs about Tlaxcalan witches (whom, when, and how they strike) all tend to conform to the realities of many instances of infant mortality which constitutes such witches' main area of activity. Concerned Tlaxcalans are fur- ther shown to manipulate evidence and invent associated experiences to substantiate these preconceptions.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 527 The authors fit such beliefs into a broader survey of Tlaxcalan beliefs about other supernaturally endowed persons such as weathermen, sorcerers, and tricksters. Such witch beliefs are embedded in pre-Hispanic cosmology argued to be peripheral to Christian and other modern influences, at least until very recently. The authors argue that witchcraft be- liefs are the most peripheral to such outside in- fluences of all Tlaxcalan notions about supernaturally endowed humans. That is be- cause these are essentially beliefs functioning to explainfaits accomplis not otherwise easily ex- plained, rather than beliefs directly employed in order to manipulate events, things and peo- ple, as is the case of sorcery or weathermaking. The authors consider their greatest contribu- tion to be the three central chapters (8, 9, and 10) where they examine the physical condi- tions and social conduct surrounding death and discovery, including protagonists' (mainly mothers) tampering with evidence, the mourners' self-promoting invention of events which support an interpretation of witchcraft, bystanders' citation of confirmatory past expe- riences and folklore about witchcraft, witch- craft-confirming purificatory rituals, and related psychological and physical disturbance of survivors which validate their grief and allay their guilt, along with parents' and kin's ensu- ing rationalizations, recriminations and reaffir- mations of events and motives. Nutini and Roberts broadly derive their approach from a combination of Evans-Pritchard's interpreta- tion of Zande witchcraft as a projective, self- fulfilling, circular system of experience and explanation, and from Kluckhohn's use of psy- chological theory in analysing beliefs regarding motives of guilt and anxiety associated with Navaho witchcraft. They end with broad tenta- tive suggestions as to how to report and analyse the occurrence and decline in supernatural be- liefs in rural 'folk' societies. This is prompted by the fact that the Tlaxcalan materials indicate a dramatic decline in the use of witchcraft be- liefs as local explanations for infant deaths since the 1960s, even though such explanations had persisted for so many earlier decades. Their own accounts for why this change has occurred are thin and not entirely convincing. Yet they are right to emphasize the importance of seeking ways to explore the psychological and ideological details behind the change from supernatural, relatively consistent, communal perceptions of causation to more objective, di- verse, naturalistic ones more in keeping with supposedly scientifically oriented, modern na- tion-states. These epistemological questions are worth asking and the rich ethnographic data are valu- able. The book, however, has serious flaws. It is poorly organized, referring readers to other volumes for clear accounts of Tlaxcalan social organization, economy, politics or cosmology, but not providing sufficient material here to make things clear. As a result it is not clear whether economic and organizational factors are as unimportant as the writers seem to sug- gest or rather that they are simply neglected. The analysis appears far less innovative than the authors claim, being one of straightforward Durkheimean functionalism, whereby such beliefs provide explanations for perplexing misfortunes, reduce anxiety, and promote group cohesion. There is little suggestion that they may ever enable some persons to manipu- late others or that they may disrupt as much as they may consolidate. The descriptive ethnog- raphy is fairly clear, but the authors descend into impenetrable prose whenever they theo- rize. The account throughout is excruciatingly verbose and repetitive. It is not reader-friendly. The book could easily have been halved with- out loss of real substance and the most impor- tant points would then have been better recognized. Finally, the authors have read nothing important written on witchcraft since 1973 and little in general about such beliefs in complex societies. Works on modern witchcraft in rural Germany (Sebald), rural France (Favret-Saada) and urban Britain (Luhrmann) are ignored, and so too is all of the vastly im- portant recent work by historians and sociolo- gists on witchcraft, sorcery and magic in Europe and New England, much relevant to the issues of how local folk or popular cultures are related to or come into conflict with cen- tralizing political, economic and religious agencies. Keith Thomas's two important his- torical studies on changing systems of thought are ignored as are writings of E.W Monter, R. Kiekhefer, N. Ben-Yehuda, H.G. Midelfort, C. Ginzburg, C. Larner, R. Muchembled, R. Martin, C. Karlsen, G. Henningsen, R. Man- drou, J. Demus, R. Weisman and many others. This is a useful book; with better organiza- tional editing, clearer, terser writing, and awareness of current scholarship, this might have been far better. T. 0.
