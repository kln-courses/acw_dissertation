Professors specializing in such topics remain untenured, unfunded, and held suspect by their colleagues, while few adequate training programs in human sexuality exist at the graduate level. Indeed, graduate students are urged to avoid the subject as a career liability. Sexuality is, however, a pervasive factor in human motivation and behavior. With the emergence of AIDS, new reproductive technologies, changing roles for men and women, and recognition of the magnitude of sexual diversity, it has become imperative that the study of sexuality achieve the status of a legitimate so- cial and biological science. Toward this end, Paul Ab- ramson and Gilbert Herdt coorganized a symposium sponsored by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthro- pological Research and attended by 23 scholars. The symposium, titled "Theorizing Sexuality: Evolution, Culture, and Development," was held March I9-27, I993, in Cascais, Portugal. It represented what was prob- ably the first major attempt in almost 30 years to com- bine anthropological perspectives on sexuality with those emerging from other social and biological sci- ences. The symposium originated in a cooperative "dream" that had preoccupied Abramson and Herdt throughout the late I980s: to create "a disciplinary matrix, a gestalt, that would fashion paradigmatic change in how we look at sexuality." They noted that the focus of sexuality- related discourse has always been reproduction. This fo- cus makes sense at lower levels of the phylogenetic lad- der, where sex invariably is linked to procreation. Higher on the ladder, however, the relationship between sex and reproduction becomes more complex. Even among nonhuman primates, for example, sex has func- tions other than reproduction, such as peace-keeping or pair-bonding. Higher still, the major portion of human sexual behavior (e.g., masturbation, intercourse with contraception, homosexuality, etc.) appears unrelated to procreation. Indeed, the more closely one looks at hu- man sexual motivation the larger looms the concept of pleasure (Abramson and Pinkerton n.d.). Because evidence for the plasticity of human sexual behavior emerges primarily from the anthropological record, Abramson and Herdt sought assistance from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. In I99I, the organizers met with representatives of the foundation in Los Angeles to finalize details of a confer- ence that would unite the cross-cultural perspective on sexuality with other social and biological sciences. At- tending the conference were nine anthropologists, two psychologists and one evolutionary psychologist, four sociologists, two primatologists, a philosopher, a de- velopmental geneticist, a historian, an operations re- searcher, and an endocrinologist. (Jeffrey Weeks, a social historian, had been scheduled to attend but was unable to do so.) All papers had been distributed in advance to facilitate a more intensive and heuristic discussion.2 In her opening statement, Sydel Silverman, president of the Wenner-Gren Foundation, noted that it had never before convened a symposium on human sexuality and in fact had never held a symposium representing so wide a range of disciplines and perspectives. She emphasized the inevitable lack of exchange between disciplines and stated that the goal of the conference was to reshape research agendas rather than achieve consensus. Sketching the contours of his "dream," Abramson stressed that whereas paradigmatic shift was an ulti- mate goal, the more proximate goals of the conference were illumination, discovery, and the generation of in- terest in the scientific and scholarly study of sexuality. Reflecting on the history of investigations of human sex- uality, Herdt argued that the paradigm developed by early contributors such as Freud and Darwin and later researchers such as Mead and Kinsey was based on self- limiting assumptions. He noted the conceptual split that 2. The conference participants, their affiliations, and (where appro- priate) their paper titles were as follows: Paul R.

Thus, the critical questions for Abramson and Herdt for this con- ference were (i) What are the received assumptions within each field, and how can we incorporate nonrepro- ductive sex into our paradigms? (2) How can we move past the influence of constricting dichotomies of sex/ gender (biology/culture) and essentialism/construc- tionism? and (3) How can we create a dialog that asks new questions across disciplines? The first session was dedicated to the history and state of sex research in general. Abramson began by not- ing that, whereas "oxymoron" might be an appropriate term to characterize the notion of "sexual science, there were, in fact, many competent scholars and scien- tists producing important work in this field, either by circumventing entrenched academic prejudice or by es- tablishing themselves in fields other than "human sexu- ality." Meyer-Bahlberg expressed some of the contradictions between researchers trained in the biological sciences and those trained in the social sciences when he admit- ted that most of his associates (physicians) gave little thought to "theory," being concerned primarily with bi- ological "facts" and the needs of patients. He reviewed some of the startling advances made over the past two decades in genetics, endocrinology, and neuroscience and detailed concerns emerging from his clinical work on sexual and reproductive dysfunctions such as ejacula- tory disorders, infertility, and complications arising from the fashioning of sexual organs for intersex surgery. Vance offered a social constructionist view of the his- tory of anthropological involvement in the study of sex- uality. She noted that even as anthropologists rebelled against essentialist biomedical models and created what she termed the "cultural influence model," they failed to question assumptions such as that sex equals repro- duction, that males and females differ in behavior and desire, and that homosexuality and heterosexuality are discrete categories. She argued that their attempts to es- cape ethnocentrism tended to further it by treating cul- ture-specific categories as though they were shared cross-culturally. She described social constructionism as not simply a focus on "nurture" but a method of inquiry that locates beliefs within their historical, social, and cultural circumstances. Supporting Abramson's com- ments about pleasure, she suggested that all large social movements are ultimately about pleasure whereas the accompanying rhetoric is never about pleasure. De Waal countered that reproduction precedes plea- sure and that the function of sex cannot be said to be pleasure. Abramson and Herdt replied that sex is multi- functional and focusing on pleasure is necessary simply to offset the prevailing view that procreation is primary. This objection and clarification inaugurated a pattern that was to pervade the conference. It became clear that the multiple disciplines represented ideological gulfs and substantial discrepancies in the usages and under- standings of language. Historians and social construc- tionists such as Fout and Vance emphasized the impor- tance of terminology and located the oppression of women and sexual minorities within the heterosexist ideology propagated by the scientific community- particularly by the "pseudoscientific" discourse related to sexuality. Scientists involved in primatology, genet- ics, and endocrinology retorted that the constructionists seemed more interested in dismantling "texts" than in attempting to understand problems or advance useful scientific endeavors. Meanings and uses of terms such as "sex," "gender," "science," "biomedical," "homosexual," "adaptation," "intersex," "function," and "reproduction" became points of heated contention. Even the notion of "sexual pleasure" was questioned: was it a socially constructed category, or did it exist autonomously within human biology and experience? In response to this challenge, Abramson-invoking Mark Twain's admonition that "the difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug"-outlined a definition admittedly imper- fect and imprecise: "Sexual pleasure refers to function- ally specific positive sensations evoked in the genitals and other relevant body parts when these body parts are stimulated. Sexual pleasure also includes the subjective experience of the positive sensations evoked by such stimulation." He contended that such experience is hard-wired at birth, innate and intrinsic to human capa- bility, but may be moderated by the physical and cul- tural milieu. He saw the capacity for sexual pleasure as an evolutionary adaptation serving as an incentive to sexual exploration-exploration that may lead to, among other things, conception. He emphasized, how- ever, that the value of sexual pleasure itself is recognized in both humans and other primates in the absence of awareness of its connection to conception and that sex is therefore pursued, traded, regulated, and commodi- tized in human and nonhuman communities. In attempting to manage the objections to position statements such as Abramson's, conference participants were suddenly faced with Hekma's sobering question: "Is it worthwhile to try to develop a sexual science that incorporates so many disciplines?" Berk wondered "Why save disciplines?" and Symons argued that one characteristic of good science is that it is not inconsis- tent with the products of other sciences, and therefore what is critical is the development of a body of knowl- edge that meets this criterion. Pavelka asked, "Well, then, what do we know for sure?" There was little sub- sequent argreement. The next morning's session, devoted to the study of primate diversity and its relation to sex and human na- ture, was dominated by de Waal's overview of his work with bonobos. While acknowledging data on the link between sex and aggression in primates, de Waal de- scribed his interest in the link between sex and reconcil- iation. He presented data on increases in sexual cues and behaviors among bonobos at food-sharing time and</page><page sequence="4">88 | CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY hypothesized that sex may serve a peace-keeping func- tion for some primates. Indeed, he suggested that such behavior may reflect the evolutionary origins of the mated, bonded pair. These primates' clear expression of nonreproductive sexual behavior, including frequent same-sex behavior, particularly between females, and apparent experience of "pleasure" during these acts seemed to him to make comparisons with humans tempting-a temptation Silverman later took pains to warn against. Participants such as Pavelka and Symons were careful to distinguish sociobiology, which dominated evolution- ary theorizing during the I98os and was characterized in part by a potential for reductionism, from the newer approaches to evolutionary psychology and primatology that attempt to avoid throwing out the sociobiological baby with its reductionist bathwater. Pavelka empha- sized that the study of primates includes the study of humans and that anthropology might best be character- ized as a subdivision of primatology. In response, Sy- mons suggested that a clearer rationale than is typically offered is needed to justify the study of primate behavior as an adjunct to the study of human behavior. For exam- ple, simply because it could be demonstrated that pro- simians were evolutionary ancestors of gorillas, would we study them for clues to gorilla behavior, or would we simply study gorillas themselves? He located a coherent rationale for primate study in the realm of hypothesis generation and noted that different animals are differen- tially useful for these purposes depending on the hypoth- eses being explored. Taking a more pessimistic view, Gregor argued that the history of primate study is the history of projective anthropomorphic identification. He wryly noted that the original objects of study were baboons, but because their behavior was unpalatable to social scientists seek- ing clues to human evolution they were abandoned in favor of chimpanzees-which in turn seem to have been discarded in favor of the still more attractive "peace- keeping" bonobos. Symons recalled the anxiety and sur- prise evoked among Jane Goodall's associates by the rev- elation of the unpleasant nature of the chimpanzee, to which they had looked as a model for human nature and evolution. Gregor went on to suggest that the differences between subhuman primates and humans-in language and family organization, for example-are so substantial as to make findings among primates of limited utility for understanding human behavior. This point of view was expressed more vehemently by Fout, who, following Pattatucci's observation that similarity between hu- mans and bonobos does not necessarily imply an evolu- tionary link between the two species, asked rhetorically, "What does primate sexuality have to do with human sexuality?" To this de Waal answered, "Everything- there is no difference" (i.e., human sexuality is primate sexuality). The afternoon was devoted to historical and construc- tionist views of ideas on desire and pleasure. Feher sum- marized his work on historical conditions related to the "arts of love," focusing on Foucault's preconditions for the emergence of love: freedom and some type of intrin- sic difficulty or obstacle to be overcome. Greenberg, pro- posing that the "reproduction vs. pleasure" dichotomy is too simplistic, pointed to multiple motives and goals of sexuality including aggression and punishment (e.g., rape)-goals which may themselves incorporate or lead to pleasure in a broader context. Tuzin reviewed recent "revisionist" scholarship on Victorian sexuality, locat- ing the rise of structural-functionalism as coincident with the response to late Victorian obsession with sexu- ality. According to Tuzin, structural-functionalism served to "reinstate sublimation" and to foster abstrac- tion and inhibit consideration of the phenomenology of sex, particularly its pleasurable aspects. He observed that our own end-of-century preoccupation with homo- sexuality, pornography, women's rights, urban blight, and international migration strikingly paralleled fin de siecle Victorian obsessions. According to Manderson, the primary difficulty facing conference participants was the operationalization of "slippery" ideas such as "sex." Did nocturnal emissions count as "sex"? Did "masturbation"? Manderson con- tended that sexuality is primarily a linguistic problem, the very notion of sexuality having emerged only during the igth century. All of our nouns are problematic, she continued, pointing to the centrality of consideration of how the nouns are used and by whom in judging their meaning and effects. She argued that the body is both a vehicle and a "text" that should be interpreted in the context of social relations of production and repro- duction. It was comments such as these that prompted Berk to compare historical constructionism with historical fiction. His experience working with police documents and newspaper reports of crime-which he character- ized as "essentially fiction"-had led him to conclude that scientific evidence cannot be obtained from histori- cal sources because these data are of highly questionable reliability and validity. Indeed, he suggested that the en- terprise being reflected in the day's proceedings was not science. Silverman countered that the proceedings were intended to explore the history of ideas, not test theory, and that such exploration had "everything to do with the scientific enterprise." Issues related to human biological development were next on the conference agenda. Wilson explained the fundamentals of hormonal influences on the developing fetus and person, focusing on the relationship of hor- mones to what he termed "sex drive" and "sexual [gen- der] identity." He emphasized that the bulk of the evi- dence still supported John Money's contention that "whether you feel male or female" is most dependent upon having been raised as male or female. He con- cluded, however, that the impact of hormones is still not well understood. This theme was picked up by Meyer-Bahlberg, who discussed the relationship in rats and humans between hormones and what he termed "arousability" (what Wilson had earlier termed "sex drive" and others had called "libido"). He pointed to the significant (but not sufficient) role of hormones in</page><page sequence="5">Volume 35, Number I, February 1994 | 89 human sexual desire and motivation and noted that this role is somewhat clearer and less complicated in the case of males. The critical unanswered question for him was the role of hormones in selectivity of human sexual desire-that is, how hormones influence arousability to a particular type of person or to a particular gender. Pattatucci, who (with her colleague Dean Hamer) had recently reported startling findings regarding the role of genetics in the sexual orientation of fruit flies and male humans, rejected the idea that such investigations ex- emplified any "harder" a scientific enterprise than work in the other disciplines represented at the conference. She referred to genes as "abstract constructs of reality" and admitted to being "ashamed" to have used the word "homosexual" in reporting on her fruit-fly work. In an impassioned plea for responsibility in the sciences, she wondered exactly what was problematic about homo- sexuality that it needed to be studied at all, given that same-gender sexual behavior constituted "one of many adaptive behaviors for our species." She concluded rhe- torically, "If we find a gene [that determines homosexu- ality], what have we found?" Symons presented a clarification of the rationale for and methods of evolutionary psychology. He empha- sized that the simplistic biological determinism often ascribed to evolutionary theorizing misrepresents an ap- proach in which interactions between organisms and their environments are of intrinsic concern. He ex- plained that, according to evolutionary theory, the or- ganism interacts with an environment it chooses and with which it has been adapted to interact over long periods of evolutionary time. If some aspect of the envi- ronment is changed in a novel way, some aspect of an adaptation may be perturbed. For example, evidence sug- gests a species-wide taste preference for foods high in sugar, fat, and salt. Such taste preferences may have been adaptive when foods containing these elements were in short supply, but now that they are overwhelm- ingly part of our environment this once adaptive taste preference "is killing us." Thus, there is no mysterious inner drive promoting reproductive success. Instead, there is merely a bundle of adaptations acquired over tens of thousands of years that may or may not promote reproductive success in novel environments. Schlegel reviewed the findings from her exploratory cross-cultural study of adolescent sexuality in I86 soci- eties. In all these societies, adolescence is clearly deline- ated as a discrete social stage, although in one society girls' experience of this stage is somewhat ambiguous. Contrary to commonsense expectations, differences in the treatment of boys and girls are remarkably constant across societies-a finding consistent with evolutionary models. Schlegel emphasized the universality of strong social constraints on the sexual behavior of adolescents, noting that these constraints typically entail a longer waiting period for boys between the onset of puberty and the age at which socially sanctioned heterosexual behaviors are permitted (girls typically marrying soon after menarche while boys marry in young adulthood). While acknowledging the compelling and internally coherent nature of the "just-so stories" told by evolu- tionary theorists, Berk expressed concem over what he considered to be the deterministic implications of evolu- tionary psychology. Drawing on his own model of uncer- tainty in the social sciences, he questioned whether we have any way of determining whether an observed be- havior represents an adaptation or "noise" (accidental or haphazard variation). He argued for the development of statistical buffers to prevent the investigator from be- ing seduced by such "noise" and suggested that stories need to be told in terms of distributions rather than point estimates (something that had not been attempted in papers such as Symons's). At the same time, he stressed that statistics cannot solve the problem of un- certainty. Inferential statistics represent little more than a language for talking about uncertainty-a language that is often ill-spoken because data are typically not drawn in such a manner as to warrant the claims made for them. He asserted that uncertainty is everywhere, cannot be avoided, and needs to be built into the design and analysis of research. Finally, he challenged the con- cept-seemingly necessary to the scientific enterprise- that every phenomenon has an explanation or at least an explanation that can be found. He expressed concern that many of the questions being asked during the con- ference may fall into the category "interesting but unan- swerable." A critical portion of the symposium involved the comparative ethnographic record. It is in comparative ethnography that questions of sexual nature vs. sexual culture have traditionally been addressed. Gregor began this portion of the proceedings by reviewing what is known about sexual universals, among which he counted mother-son incest avoidance, sexual jealousy, shame, and fear, the correlation of love and sex, the so- cial use of sex as metaphor to express a portion of cul- tural world view, and the absence of "neutrality" toward sex (the one seeming exception to this last being the sexually "indifferent" Dani studied by Heider [I976]). He went on to point to the ubiquity of sexual or "roman- tic" love in non-Western societies, a finding contrary to the often repeated contention that "love" as a construct is specific to Western societies. He argued that, like sex- uality, love may be socially repressed. He offered a poi- gnant and effective evocation of the ecstatic experience of passionate love and then reviewed psychological and sociological theories related to this emotion. These the- ories ranged from the pragmatic economics of Randall Collins's "wine-press" theory through Freud to Stern- berg's (I986) and Lee's (I973) classification schemes for love styles and Bowlby's (I958) work on attachment- work that Shaver, Hazen, and Bradshaw (i988) have ex- tended to explore the notion that infant attachment styles are templates for adult love relationships. The case-study method Gregor used for portions of his work came under challenge from Berk, who again wondered exactly what enterprise was being repre- sented. In response, Herdt and Abramson defended case studies from an anthropological viewpoint, and, when used inductively, from the point of view of a traditional</page><page sequence="6">90 I CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Baconian model of science. Schlegel suggested that methods such as the case study may help to identify patterns that can be correlated with known statistical facts. Herdt reviewed his groundbreaking work on ritualized same-sex behaviors among the Sambia of New Guinea (cf. Herdt I987). He explained why he had dropped the use of the term "homosexual" for the ritualized fellating of older Sambian men by boys. Because this behavior, founded as it is on the belief that insemination is essen- tial for the boy's sexual growth and passage into adult- hood and heterosexual marriage, emphasizes symbolic or biological reproduction, use of the term "homosex- ual" to describe it may distort the meaning of the term as a categorical construct. Nevertheless, he pointed out, pleasure, lewdness, and lasciviousness are also involved in this ritual. In attempting to explain this apparent par- adox, he identified the "extremist" positions typically taken to explain it-on the one hand as a universal expe- rience of same-sex desire couched in ritual and on the other as a culture-specific practice that cannot be com- pared in any way to Western notions of homosexual- ity-and argued that neither position is adequate. Con- sistent with the former position are bonding and fantasizing about one's ritual partner, gift giving, protec- tion of the boy by the older male, and frequent continu- ance of a "special" friendship-minus the fellatio-after the boy has achieved manhood and marriage. Consistent with the latter position are the absence of same-sex be- haviors among equal-age-paired partners, the fact that the sexual aspect of the "relationship" is never continu- ous throughout life (indeed, boys are discouraged from maintaining the same insemination partner for too long), the absence of a "gay" category in Sambian cul- ture, the limitation of same-sex behaviors to males, and the fact that the acts of oral sex are strongly linked to the growth of the boys and only relatively weakly linked to pleasure. Thus, Herdt concluded that what occurs among the Sambia is the fusing of a set of desires with an emphasis on growth and socialization of the young, a practice distinct to time and place; whereas compari- sons with other cultures and practices may be made, it is important to be aware of the limitations of such comparisons. Issues of data measurement and modeling were ex- plored by Berk and Kaplan. Berk reported the findings of a study coauthored by Abramson and Okami that at- tempted to measure error in self-reports of sexual behav- ior. Undergraduate students were asked to keep diaries of their sexual experiences and then subsequently asked to recall the number of times they had engaged in vari- ous activities during the diary period. The emergence of specific clusters of recall problems called into question the reliability of sexual "histories" that survey research- ers generally take for granted. Kaplan explained to the uninitiated the difference be- tween statistical models, which try to construct unbi- ased estimates, and policy models, which attempt to "build in" every known bias. Uses of policy modeling in AIDS research and sexual behavior in general were delineated. Kaplan explained how policy modeling re- duces the amount of evidence that needs to be collected in attempting to structure questions regarding sexually active populations and briefly reviewed some newer uses of modeling in exploring issues of pleasure-for exam- ple, Abramson and Pinkerton's (i992) use of such tech- niques to explore the notion of "rationality" in "risky" sexual behaviors. The remainder of the conference was devoted to at- tempts at synthesis, with the critical question being whether theoretical integration was possible or even de- sirable. The discussion centered once again on the oppo- sition between empirical data gathering and hypothesis testing and postmodern, postpositivist constructionist scholarship/science. Whereas several participants at- tempted to resist such dichotomies, they were generally unsuccessful, as the fundamental contradictions be- tween the two approaches resurfaced repeatedly. The more extreme view of them was articulated by Fout, who considered communication across this opposition almost impossible. Tuzin, in contrast, painted an opti- mistic picture-one that was probably not shared by a majority of participants. He identified a "family of ge- neric categories of problems" emerging from the confer- ence: (i) measurement, (2) biomedical issues related to the existence or nonexistence of "sexuality" as an entity suitable for study, (3) evolutionary mechanisms in repro- ductive and nonreproductive sex, (4) regulative dimen- sions of sexuality such as how state societies regulate, control, and dominate in spheres of sexual life, and (5) humanistic concerns for human beings' "deep and abid- ing interest in sexuality as a topic." He contended that a "meta-problem" emerged from the synergism of the five "problems" just mentioned: What are our choices for the future? Ultimately, Abramson reflected, we would either grow closer together or become more cognizant of our differences. Herdt noted that whereas we had not gone beyond the categories that dominated the conference chaired in the mid-ig6os by Frank Beach-probably the last major attempt to convene a symposium integrating multidisciplinary approaches to the study of sexuality- at least we had looked at categories that had not been on the table since that time. He echoed Abramson in wondering if we could simply accept our differences or at least live with them. A book based upon revisions of a number of the con- ference papers is in preparation for publication by the University of Chicago Press.
