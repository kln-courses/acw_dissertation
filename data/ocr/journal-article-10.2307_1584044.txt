<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS b) "Geradamas" does not mean "Adam the stranger" but gerai(os) adam, the translation of Adam Qadmon, archetypal Adam (the term is also attested in Mandaean literature); c) Adamas is rightly translated as "the Human" but the author fails to see that his Gnostics combined the divine, heavenly Adam, the male Glory of Ezekiel 1,26, with the Platonic idea of Humanity. The background of the "Perfect Human" is a thrice male, incredibly crude anthropomorphism; d) "Paroikesis" in Zostrianos and mentioned by Plotinus does not mean Transmigration, but Exile, galuth; e) Williams denies that the two "races" in the Acts of Andrew in- dicate two "natures" that are radically opposed to each other. He forgets the Utrecht fragment of these Acts ("you see your physis expos- ing you"). And he ignores the established fact that according to the Essene Manual of Discipline there are two toledoth, "natures", the children of light and the children of darkness, both predestined to be so (Gershom Scholem, Sefer Asaf, Jerusalem 1954). Against this perspective it is probable that the "immovable race" is also predestined to eternal bliss, whereas the children of Cain are predestined to eternal damnation. Williams tries to introduce a free will into this consistent model. It is regrettable that a book so well researched, thorough and readable, contains such obvious flaws. There is some danger that Gnosis again, as in the past, will be interpreted as if it were a Greek philosophy, not an Oriental mythology. But image always precedes concept, mythos antedates logos. 3722 BR Bilthoven, N. Houdringelaan 32 G. QUISPEL Sven Lundstrom, Die Uberlieferung der lateinischen Irenaeusuberset- zung, Uppsala 1985, 165 pages. The author of this book, one of the most gifted and prolific scholars from the school of Einar Loffstedt, published his dissertation on the Latin translation of Irenaeus in 1943. This was followed by a new work on the same subject in 1948 as well as by textcritical contributions on Irenaeus Latinus in 1955 and observations on the fourth book of the bishop of Lyons in 1969. If anybody can express a considered opinion 412</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS on the new edition of Irenaeus in the series Sources Chretiennes (1952-1982), it is this meticulous and very able philologist. And he is not enthusiastic. Again and again he proves that the editors of this text on the one hand were not familiar enough with Late Latin and on the other hand overrated the very free Armenian translation. He proposes at least a thousand plausible corrections of the S.C. text. One of them is very important because it is related to Gnostic origins: Tales quidem secundum eos sententiae sunt, a quibus, velut Lernaea hydra, multiplex capitibus fera de (deleverunt editores S.C.) Valentini scola generata est (I, 30, 15) "There are the views of those by whom the many headed beast, sort of Hydra of Lerna, was generated that arose from the school of Valentinus". The different teachers, Theodotus, Ptolemaeus, Heracleon, which arose from the school of Valentinus, are here said to go back to the sects de- scribed in I, 29 (= the Apokryphon of John) and I, 30. And yet it would seem that Lundstrom has been too harsh with the editors of this text, who after all terminated a work which others promised and announced for decades and failed to produce. Unwittingly the learned Swede is a witness for the defense, when he says that the doctrine of I, 29 reflects the views of the Barbeliots and I, 30 those of the Ophites. The names are of later date and inadequate, based upon the reading in 1, 29: multitudo Gnosticorum [Barbelo] ex- surrexit. Rousseau and Doutreleau, the editors of book I, prove convin- cingly that Barbelo here is a gloss (S.C. 263, p. 296). The sectarians to whom Valentinus was indebted called themselves: Gnostikoi. They were the only ones in Antiquity to do so. All talk about Ophites, Barbeliots, Sethians in this context is unfounded. It is certainly true that those who want to edit Irenaeus must know Late Latin, but they must also be familiar with the vexed problem of Gnostic origins. Rousseau and Doutreleau were. They sometimes even went as far as to prefer the Latin translation when a stupid monk had corrupted the Greek. Basing themselves in 1, 6, 4 on the Latin (ut ei con- iungatur) exclusively, they restored autei krathenai (to become one with her) in stead of kratethenai (to rape her), which is without all shadow of a doubt the original reading, though it is not attested in any Greek text (ib., 206). So they uncovered the remarkable view of the Valenti- 413</page><page sequence="3">nians that love is not to be condoned, but is valued in its own right, because it unites the opposites and achieves wholeness. Lundstrom is right, but so are his opponents. 3722 BR Bilthoven, N. Houdringelaan 32 G. QUISPEL Ioan Petru Culianu, Gnosticismo e pensiero moderno: Hans Jonas. Bretschneider, Rome 1985. 155 pages. The author of this book gives a sympathetic and moderately critical survey of Jonas's influential theories and suggests that these positions can be held even now, after Heidegger and his impact have passed out, after the Iranian myth of the saved saviour, naively accepted by Jonas and his mentor Bultmann, turned out to be a hoax, after the Alexan- drian, Jewish origins of Gnosticism have been uncovered. According to the present reviewer Jonas was right when he saw that Valentinus, Origen and Plotinus were in the same boat, though he failed to see that the theologian and the philosopher were effectively influenced by the mythologist. Culianu ends with an interview about Jonas's life and career. He mercifully conceals that the habit of his hero to play the man in stead of the ball cost him the friendship of Gershom Sholem. 3722 BR Bilthoven, N. Houdringelaan 32 G.
