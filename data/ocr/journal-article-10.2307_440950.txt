<plain_text><page sequence="1">WAS HARDY ANTHROPOMORPHIC? GILBERT NEIMAN The popular opinion of Thomas Hardy is well expressed in the first sentence of Samuel C. Chew's arti- cle on him in A Literary History of England: "The ideas and emotions which Hardy cautiously termed his 'tentative metaphysic' took shape so gradually that no point in his career can be indicated where the fatalism of his youth gave way to the final determinism of his old age."' First a fatalist and then a determinist-such are the back- grounds of most articles discussing the earlier and the later Thomas Hardy. And it would not be un- just to say that these articles con- tain much more of the cloth of their backdrop than they do of the vitality of the victim set up before them. Yet there is a certain strain of ambiguity running throughout Hardy's works which lends itself to a semblance of corroboration of the above view, and I think it could be termed a mystical strain in Hardy which forever eludes his attempts in prose to state it in a "tentative metaphysic." It is ap- parent in the character of Pierston in The Well-Beloved. He is attract- ed to more women than the two main ones, but sex is never the basic reason for his attraction to them. As Mr. Webster says in his study of Thomas Hardy, "the at- traction of the women is neither rationally explicable nor satisfy- ing in the results it produces. It is 'the traction of some mystic mag- net which has nothing to do with reason.' " Each succeeding woman is " 'the exponent of the Long-pur- sued-as one who, by no initiative of his own, had been chosen by some superior Power as the ve- hicle of her next debut.' "2 And Mr. Webster goes on to call this book important for being the full- est expression of "Hardy's belief in the unrealizability of man's high- er desires, one of the primary rea- sons why he lamented the antilogy involved in giving man conscious- ness. ... "3 I think we can dis- cover, upon further examination of a few aspects of Hardy's thought, that this problem of not finding a rational explanation for the mag- netic attraction which women have for Hardy's heroes is at the root of his eternal search for some meaning in the universe. I consider a fairly early poem of Hardy's, called "The Lacking Sense," as a basic statement of this mystical strain which has confound- ed critics, and which continued throughout Hardy's life.4 A typi- cal Hardy scene is stated as a stage direction at the beginning of the Ioem: "A sad-coloured landscape. Waddon Vale." The first stanza goes: "O Time, whence comes the Mother's moody look amid her labours, As of one who all unwittingly has wounded where she loves? Why weaves she not her world- webs to according lutes and tabors, 86</page><page sequence="2">With nevermore this too remorseful air upon her face, As of angel fallen from grace?" Fatalism is a form of determin- ism, particularly in its theological aspect which asserts that all human activities are predetermined by God. Determinism is the doctrine that every fact in the universe is guided entirely by law. In psychol- ogy, determinism becomes the doc- trine that the will is not free but instead determined by psychical or physical conditions. Let us look closely at this poem for evidence of either fatalism or determinism. The second stanza continues: -"Her look is but her story: con- strue not its symbols keenly: In her wonderworks yea surely she wounded where she loves. The sense of ills misdealt for blisses blanks the mein most queenly, Self-sinitings kill self-joys; and every- where beneath the sun Such deeds her hands have done." Notice that the poem is in the form of a dialogue with Time re- sponding to the questioning man. In the first stanza we have the poet comparing Nature to a Mother who has the moody look in the midst of her labors of having thoughtlessly wounded the ones she most lovles. In the second stanza we have Time agreeing and adding that her face is rendered blank by the sense of having dealt ills where she had intended to mete out blisses. Now, we must ask ourselves if fatalism, or the as- sertion that all human activities are predetermined by God, is pres- ent here. As so often happens in Hardy's poems, here he has equated Nature with God. And, further- more, though this is often denied, he has given a distinctly anthropo- morphic character to both Nature and God, for what could be more anthropomorphic t h a n calling them Mother? Yet the Mother deals out ills where she meant to strew blisses, the result is haphaz- ard, and what is less predeter- mined than the haphazard? In the third stanza, the questioning man asks of Time the reason for this haphazard creation, one might al- most say destruction: -"'And how explains thy Ancient Mind her crinies upon her creatures, These fallings from her fair begin- nings, woundings where she loves, Into her would-be perfect motions, modes, effects, and features Admitting cramps, black humors, wan decay, and baleful blights, Distress into delights?" Here Time is addressed as "An- cient Mind," is personified as a source of eternal wisdom which hlolds the answers to man's ques- tions. Time, or Ancient Mind, re- plies: -"Ah! knowest thou not her secret yet, her vainly veiled deficience, Whence it comes that all unwit- tingly she wounds the lives she loves? That sightless are those orbs of hers?- which bar to her omniscience Brings those fearful unfulfilments, that red ravage through her zones Whereat all creation groans. We see that Nature is sightless. The "red ravage" which this sight- lessness of Nature causes is highly reminiscent of Tennyson's evolu- tionary disillusionment with Na- ture "red in tooth and claw." We are also reminded of tile "purblind 87</page><page sequence="3">doomsters" of "Hap," of "crass Casualty and dicing Time," who could as readily strew blisses around man's pilgrimage as pain. But is all as totally helpless and hopeless as it would seem? Time goes on with its description of Na- ture's sightlessness, "the lacking sense": "She whispers it in each pathetic strenuous slow endeavour, When in mothering she unwit- tingly sets wounds on what she loves; Yet her primal doom pursues her, faultful, fatal is she ever; Though so deft and nigh to vis- sion is her facile finger-touch That the seers marvel much. Let us note here that a glimmer of hope is seen creeping into the dismal picture, and for the first time. Not all is necessarily lost, because the Mother's "facile finger- touch" is "so deft and nigh to vi- sion" that "the seers marvel much." There are seers to whom this Mother, or Nature, is almost akin. That also is a hopeful sign, and upon it Hardy erects the magnifi- cent close of this majestic poem, which close is the end of Time's rejoinder to man's petulant queries about the cruel injustice of Na- ture's handiwork: "Deal, then, her groping skill no scorn, no note of malediction; Not long on thee will press the hand that hurts the lives it loves; And while she plods dead-reckoning on, in darkness of affliction, Assist her where thy creaturely de- pendence can or may, For thou art of her clay." We must return to the psycho- logical definition of determinism, which is the doctrine that the will is not free but determined by psy- chical or physical conditions, and ask ourselves if this advice which Time, or Ancient Mind, gives to man could be given to a creature who was inescapably in the grip of determined cause and effect. The answer can only be in the nega- tive. If man had no will of his own, how could he assist the blind Mother in her "strenuous slow en- deavour," how could he choose to deal "her groping skill no scorn"? It is difficult to explain why Douglas Brown in his recent book, Thomas Hardy, finds "The Lack- ing Sense" a "scarred and dis- jointed" poem. He finds that it is one of many of Hardy's "dis- tressed readings of life."" The poem is measured, serene, even stately, with none of the wry tele- scoping of diction which sometimes obtrudes in Hardy's verses to the detriment of the poem as a whole. I see this poem as an exquisite statement of the feeling which led Hardy into his position of formu- lating a concept of Immanent Will as an explanation of the enigmatic nature of creation. Let us first have a look at this concept as it is summarized by Mr. Webster: The universe is constantly in the process of change; hence the Imma- nent Will, which is identical with the universe, also changes. As a result of an almost infinite process of change, as an unconscious and undesired re- sult of the Immanent Will's dialectic, consciousness emer ged in man. Through man's conscious awareness he can control and change those parts of the universe which are the products of his consciousness (i.e., society) even if he cannot overcome or change for the present the unconscious portions of the universe or the unconscious (i.e., emotional) parts of himself. Ul- 88</page><page sequence="4">timately, perhaps, consciousness will inform the entire Will, and all things will be fashioned closer to even the heart's desire." Mr. Webster goes on to say that this is the entire Weltanschauung of The Dynasts, that in this con- cept (and with the aid of the Ger- man philosopher Von Hartmann) Hardy has finally reconciled a be- lief in man's actions being deter- mined with a belief in the fact that they can change the world. Yet I must differ from Mr. Webster here, in that I cannot believe that a man who says, as Hardy did to William Archer, "When we have got rid of a thousand remediable ills, it will be time enough to de- termine whether the ill that is ir- remediable outweighs the good,"- it is impossible for me to believe that such a person is convinced that man's actions are determined. Such a conviction was present in the early Hardy of "Hap," per- haps, but it was constantly dimin- ishing throughout his lifetime; and it is not present in "The Lacking Sense," which I take to be an early poem. Mr. Southworth says in his study of The Poetry of Thomas Hardy: "He once dreamed, for example, that a germ of Consciousness from another planet awoke the earth to a realization of the cruelty and misery that here exist hand in hand and of which it had never before taken cognizance."' Hardy's theory of the Immanent Will is insepa- rable from his theory of the evolu- tionary development of conscious- ness. One of the most obvious flaws in this is that as an uncon- scious and even undesired result of the Immanent Will's (or the Ancient Mind's) dialectic con- sciousness emerges in man. Evelyn Hardy has some illuminating state. ments to make about this weakness in Hardy's self-termed "tentative philosophy": When Alfred Noyes corners him by writing that he himself has never been able to conceive "a Cause of Things which could be less in any re- spect than the thing caused," Hardy retreats from the fray by replying that the ways of Providence are in- deed inscrutable, only he does not call it Providence, a name too hack- neyed and too kind, he calls it "The Scheme of Things."8 Yet we must not forget, when we try to attach strict philosophical deductive or inductive principles to Thomas Hardy's many state- ments of what would seem to be an attempt at a great philosophical synthesis of the universe, that, as Evelyn Hardy points out: "His so- called 'philosophy,' the amalgam of his reaction to life is, he says, nothing more than 'a confused heap of impressions, like those of a bewildered child at a conjuring show.' "I Nor should we forget that the poet is often more perceptive than the philosopher, as well as more influential. We should never, either in the role of critic or phi- losopher, underrate the importance of the fact that most of the human race, if not ourself included, is like "a bewildered child at a conjuring show." Even Lascelles Abercrombie in his quite dated work on Hardy de- tects the basic anthropomorphisism in the poet: "Some such objection is unavoidably aroused by Hardy's lyrical attribution to the Deity of the humanly perceived limits of existence . 0. ."o0 It is strange that most critics of Hardy fail to see this aspect. They attribute to him an abstraction-making mind that came to far-reaching conclusions 89</page><page sequence="5">which the practical poet and novel- ist never conceived of. Albert J. Guerard does not reach a contra- dictory conclusion in his study of Hardy's novels: "Less austere and less ambitious than Conrad, Hardy confined himself to our unregen- erate longing for happiness and our common destiny of suffering."'1 I would seriously take exception to Mr. Gubrard's use of the word un- regenerate. (What has become so fashionable, or should I say fouled- up, with our generation that it is unregenerate to long for happi- ness?) But that Hardy deals with our longing for happiness and our common destiny of suffering can hardly be denied. That is his strength and not a weakness. And as Carl Weber has so aptly put it, "there was nothing of Job's curse- God-and-die about Hardy's mes- sage."12 Yet, as William Rutland has said: "There is no writer of the first rank in English literature, not even excepting the author of Lear and Hamlet, who has wrestled in spirit more arduously with [the problem of suffering] than Thomas Hardy."'3 Hardy's questions of the why of existence, as we see in "The Lacking Sense," are always interwoven with his questions about the problem of pain. In "The Lacking Sense" we are told that it is the Mother's blindness which brings about "that red rav- age through her zones / Whereat all creation groans." And still, un- like Job, we should deal "her grop- ing skill .. no note of maledic- tion." Instead, man is exhorted to "assist her where thy creaturely de- pendence can or may." And why should man act thus? He is given the most direct explanation of all as to why such action is befitting. Because he is really at one with the Mother. The poem ends on the unforgettable verse: "For thou art of her clay." Now I would like to propose that Hardy's concept of Nature as Mother-in this poem as well as in another one, "The Mother Mourns"-is much closer to the Hindu concept of the Divine Mother, Mother Kali, than the many critics who call Hardy an agnostic or an atheist would be willing to infer. One image of Mother Kali, or Primal Energy, is described as follows, which will give one a fair idea of the scope of the concept behind the statue: She wears necklaces of gold and pearls, a golden garland of human heads, and a girdle of human arms. ... She has four arms. The lower left hand holds a severed human head and the upper grips a blood-stained sabre. One right hand offers boons to Her children; the other allays their fear. The majesty of Her posture can hardly be described. It combines the terror of destruction with the re- assurance of motherly tenderness. For She is the Cosmic Power, the totality of the universe, a glorious harmony of the pairs of opposites. She deals out death, as She creates and pre- serves. She has three eyes, the third being the symbol of Divine Wisdom; they strike dismay into the wicked, yet pour out affection for Her de- votees. ... She is Prakriti, the Pro- creatrix, Nature, the Destroyer, the Creator. Nay, She is something great- er and deeper still for those who have eyes to see. She is the Universal Mother, "my Mother," as Ramakrishna would say, the All-powerful, who re- veals Herself to Her children under different aspects and Divine Incarna- tions. the Visible God, who leads the elect to the Invisible Reality: and if it so pleases Her, She takes away the last trace of ego from created beings 90</page><page sequence="6">and merges it in the consciousness of the Absolute, the undifferentiated God."1 Hardy implies this duality of destructiveness combined with cre- ative consciousness in his poem when he says: "fatal is she ever; / Though so deft and nigh to vision is her facile finger-touch / That the seers marvel much." And though Hardy certainly does not seem to be a man who has often found the Visible God, he con- stantly is surprising us in his best poems by taking "away the last trace of ego from created beings and [merging] it in the conscious- ness of the Absolute." I can think of no better description of the effect his greatest poems have than just this. Likewise, I would like here to repeat my quotations from Mr. Webster's book on Hardy which I gave at the beginning of this paper. "The attraction of the women is neither rationally ex- plicable nor satisfying in the re- sults it produces. It is 'the trac- tion of some mystic magnet which has nothing to do with reason.'" Each succeeding woman is "'the exponent of the Long-pursued-as one who, by no initiative of his own, had been chosen by some su- perior Power as the vehicle of her next debut.' " The women in Hardy's poems and novels share the dual aspects of the Divine Mother, they create and they de- stroy. Around their necks are gar- lands of human heads. And one can say of each one of his women, we can almost hear Hardy's heroes pronounce the words: "For thou art of her clay." University of New Mexico tSamuel C.
