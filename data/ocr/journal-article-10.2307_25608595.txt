Morris, School of Humanities (Archaeology), University of Southampton, Southamp ton, S017 1BF, U. K. Explore Jamaican prehistory! This is the challenge set by Philip Allsworth-jones in his outstanding publication, which allows us to do just that. From our own desks and computers, we can discover and engage with this Caribbean island's early history simply by reading his sys tematic presentation of a wealth of information in both text and digital formats. My advice to anyone who may be unaware of what Precolumbian Jamaica has to offer the world: do not worry, help is at hand. Start by entering this new world through the CD-ROM (navigation advice is provided in Chapter 1; requires Windows XP, Access 2002 or higher and 100MB of space to run). I left it until last, preferring a more traditional, linear route through the vol ume and quickly realized the error of my ways. This disk, well-secured inside the back cover, holds the keys of entry, first with an 1897 map of Amerindian sites published as part of "Aboriginal Indian Remains in Jamaica" by J. E. Duerden in the Journal of the Institute of Jamaica (1987) and now reprinted in its entirety as Appendix D of the book. This alone shows that Jamaica is rich with prehisto ry and deserves our attention. But don't stop there; click on the buttons for "Picture Gallery" and "Lee Family Collec tion" and feast on the range of complete pots, decorated sherds, worked shell tools, chipped and ground stone arti facts, as well as petroglyphs and pictoglyphs. Get to know the portable material culture of the Late Ceramic Age (post-a.d. 600) of Jamaica before you tackle the text and so ease your passage through this exploration. Why is Jamaican prehistory so understudied? There have been plenty of excavations over the past 100 years or more, but the fault, repeated many times by Allsworth jones, is lack of publication. Too many sites have been in vestigated without reacliing the printed pages or in many cases even attempting to publish seems to have been absent from the excavator's agenda of responsibilities. In the dis tant past, this was due to lack of skills and experience be cause so many investigators were untrained amateurs with one exception, James Lee, a professional geologist. He was someone who realized that much could be done to secure archaeological evidence without digging a single sondage.</page><page sequence="2">Journal of ^ Field Archaeology/Vol. 34, 2009 363 He believed in modernizing the data already held in the archives of the Jamaican National Heritage Trust, first by mapping the location of265 sites (middens and caves) and providing them with grid references and standard identity codes, and then surface-collecting samples of finds to rep resent known sites, visiting caves to record petroglyphs and pictoglyphs before they were damaged or destroyed, and simply being scientifically systematic about his records. He created what would now be known as the first sites and monuments register for the island; the CD-ROM provides details about each of these sites and monuments and also five sites discovered or excavated more thoroughly since 1986. It is to Lee that Allsworth-Jones acknowledges a wealth of gratitude for it is primarily his contribution to Ja maican prehistory that this book celebrates. Lee passed away before the publication date, but marikfully knew it was imminent. Allsworth-Jones, with principal funding from two mineral companies for the analysis of the mater ial, preparation of illustrations, and creation of the CD ROM, and with the help of Esther Rodriques and the Uni versity of Glasgow, has brought Jamaican prehistory to the world stage at an affordable price. The book was created as a narrative that begins with a history of field investigations on the island, briefly provides a general framework for Caribbean prehistory focusing on Rouse's (1992) chronological system and alternative scheme, and gamely introduces us to the Tafnos and the Arawakan language family. Allsworth-Jones does not linger long on these topics, which is a wise move. Far more en ticing, and clearly one of his strengths, is the subsequent Chapter 4 on the environment, flora, and fauna, which takes the reader on a roadshow of geography, geology, and the climatic fluctuations of the late Pleistocene and the Holocene. We learn about the wet and dry cycles evidenced from dated lake cores as well as the significance of older and younger mountain ranges, the variety of climates, and the importance of drainage basins as a backdrop to prehis toric settlements. He introduces the Jamaican coney or hutta which played a major role in Taino subsistence, as did a range of indigenous plants. Chapter 5 gives a feeling for the complexity of the ar chaeological record as it currendy exists. Of the 271 known sites, there are 191 (164 middens and 27 caves) in the in ventory for which artifacts or other remains exist, and these produced 28,149 artifacts, 1221 identified shells, 393 identified animal bones, and 389 human bones all repre sented on the database which can be accessed via the site name. Pottery makes up the majority of the artifacts and these have been analyzed and registered in a straightfor ward recording system adapted from Shepard's vessel form scheme (1956), with many sherds and vessels presented as line drawings and digital photos along with earthenware beads, stamps, plugs, and pendants. Amongst the 538 drawings and 213 photos, a range of stone artifacts is also characterized including celts, pendants, hooks, beads, balls, chisels, and an anthropomorphic figure. Yet, it is Chapters 6 and 7 that show the potential of this wealth of data. Allswdrth-Jones has been able to explore the inventory of mapped sites and material culture and begin the compari son of site locations, topography, distance from the coast, size, and artifacts and food remains to reveal patterns that create questions which beg future investigation. These chapters are an ideal starting point for dozens of research students at all levels to use as a testing ground to practice their skills in data assessment before launching their own research in the field or laboratory. For example, seven sites produced excavated assemblages of vertebrate remains, which were analyzed and reported by Elizabeth Wing and Sylvia Scudder. Leaving out crabs and lobsters not includ ed in six of the reports, one sees that 50-90% of south coast site assemblages are composed of hutia but only 21-22% of assemblages on the north coast are, with the ex ception of one site, Upton. Go to Appendix 43 on the CD ROM to find out why. Allsworth-jones is not using this book to give answers to questions, but simply to present patterns and possibili ties. He has not presented any of his own theories or themes of setdement and social organization, but has shown what can be discovered from the data now available. Some readers may find this frustrating or a weakness of the book, but this was not its stated purpose. I, for example, would have been interested in a fuller discussion about the lack of evidence for Lithic Age (4000-400 B.C.) or Archa ic Age (5000-200 B.C.) activity on this large island of the Greater Antilles. Jamaica is not an insignificant island with its mountain ranges, proximity to other large islands with these flaked and ground stone artifacts, and plentiful chert resources of its own. There is no comment about this ab sence of evidence; is it truly negative evidence or a reflec tion of skills in the field? Allsworth-jones discusses post Pleistocene rise in sea level as a possible problem, but does not use it as a platform for exploring the lack of evidence. Keegan notes that the abundance of Archaic Age sites on Antigua "reflects both easy access to chert, and the intensi ty with which the island has been surveyed" (1994: 267). No systematic surveys exist for Jamaica. If teams of lithic specialists commenced surveys, would these millennia of occupation be revealed? Projectile points from Old Har bour, Jamaica were considered to be similar to points found on Antigua and Trinidad and to Lithic Age points from South and Central America (Harris 1991; Keegan 1994: 264), but this collection does not appear in the com</page><page sequence="3">364 Book Reviews plete list of sites by parish in Appendix B so there may be a problem with the collection. Appendix A provides summaries of the 32 principal ex cavated sites in Jamaica. These entries present historical ref erences to each site with its parish and Lee inventory code (e.g., Cinnamon Hill, St. Ann's Parish, J10), brief descrip tions of what was found (often direct quotations from the archival records), the conditions of the site at last record such as "extant in 1973, when it was reported to be plant ed with vegetables" [p. 137], and the radiocarbon dates, faunal reports, and pottery types where present. This is a quick route into using the database on the CD-ROM which follows the parish system. Allsworth-Jones has provided an excellent introduction to Jamaican prehistory. It achieves his goals of presenting the history of archaeological explorations and discoveries on Jamaica and shows us the wealth of Precolumbian land scape, settlement, cave, artifact, subsistence, and spiritual evidence available from this underexplored island.
