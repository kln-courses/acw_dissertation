<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Meaning of Life. By C. E. M. Joad. (London: The Rational Press Association, Ltd. 1928. Pp. iv -f 60. Price is. net.) This brief volume presents a lucid and concise outline of the author's unqualified Vitalism. He repudiates Theism, Materialism, and Mentalism (which, however, he styles Idealism), in favour of the hypothesis that matter and life are "ultimate principles, neither of which can be resolved into the other." Life itself, still further, is essentially purposive; and its manifestation in all physical organisms is the means that it has chosen to effect its end and to achieve its final "goal in the world of value." This in its turn necessitates the ultimate transcendence of all modes of individuality, including person? ality; for this, like its simpler prototypes, is only one of life's temporary instru? ments, to be discarded as soon as its functions have been fulfilled. Mr. Joad gives a clear and interesting account of the recent developments in theoretical Physics, especially as regards the Principle of Causation, and claims, while fully recognizing the issue to be extremely debatable, that the current concepts of energy and matter go far towards substantiating his own vitalist principles, though many will consider his inferences to be somewhat exaggerated. It is also unfortunate, in my opinion, that he continues to adhere to his stereotyped and seriously inadequate description of Idealism as "the view that only mind is real, and that matter is an illusion." It is highly ques? tionable that this "has been on the whole the dominant view of philosophers," while the ablest and most famous Idealists have at the same time been realistic in their theories of the material world. There is, again, an apparent contra? diction between "an initiative inherent in matter" of p. 17, and "static matter" of p. 21; while to carry out to its logical conclusion his suggestion that, "when we know anything at all external to our minds, it is" an occur? rence in brain matter that we know, would be to invite a hopelessly confused epistemology. My own final impression, however, is of a fundamental vagueness in the concept of life itself. Granting its absolute disparity from matter, and its final equally absolute transcendence of all its known forms, what is its essential nature? Mr. Joad himself expresses this in terms of "attention, contemplation activity," and "purpose." It is obvious that each of these is open to the objection, generally regarded as fatal, of being irremediably anthropomorphic. If this is insuperable, then the essential nature of life becomes, in any real sense, incomprehensible; while if it cannot be sustained, life's attributes must share something in common with the inherent features of even human personality. But this, no doubt, is an issue which will ere long engage the author's further consideration. J. E. Turner. 277</page></plain_text>
