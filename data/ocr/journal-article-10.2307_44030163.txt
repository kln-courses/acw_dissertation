<plain_text><page sequence="1">Drawing on both folklore studies and literary analysis, this essay contends that the figure of the animal para- mour in the Child ballads represents, in objectified form, the inherent animality and duality of human nature. Ballads featuring sexual relations between humans and anthropomorphic animals address the complex human interaction with the natural world.

In what follows, I will be examining one particu- lar group of ballads, which, for convenience I am calling the animal-paramour bal- lads. These ballads all feature a sexual relationship between a human being and an anthropomorphic supernatural animal, suggesting a complex interchange between the animal and the human states, the meaning of which will be my subject here. The ballads I will be discussing all derive from Francis James Child's canonical The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. This collection of 305 ballads, first published in five volumes between 1882 and 1898, has become the standard anthology for English-language balladry. Child was a scholar of mediaeval literature and the first Professor of English at Harvard University. He devoted the second part of his career to compiling as comprehensive a collection as possible of the traditional ballads of England and Scotland. Tragically, Child died two years before the last of his five vol- umes appeared in print. Nevertheless, as Sigrid Rieuwerts notes in her memorial Mosaic 40/1 0027- 1276-07/1 450 1 8$02.00Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">146 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) essay: "Child's industry, judgement and accuracy ensured that ESPB [. . .] became the standard reference point for all subsequent work in the field of English-language tra- ditional balladry" (23). The ballads that Child canonized are now internationally referred to as Child 1-305, and shall be so designated here. Furthermore, because I am treating the ballads as a single generic form, I shall be referring to them as if they were a monolithic creation, rather than distinguishing them by their national or historical provenance. The arship appearance on the ballads of Child's in the collection twentieth in century. the late This 1800s first inspired wave, the while first often wave concerned of schol- arship on the ballads in the twentieth century. This first wave, while often concerned with the insoluble debate over ballad origins - that is, whether ballads were created communally or individually - also focused attention on the folkloric underpinnings of balladry, especially as these relate to the supernatural. This line of investigation, begun by Child himself in his headnotes to the supernatural ballads in his collection, received its most extended consideration with the publication in 1928 of Lowry Charles Wimberly's classic, Folklore in the English and Scottish Ballads. Wimberly's book was reprinted in 1965, a decade that saw renewed interest in folk music and, especially, in balladry. Subsequent trends in ballad scholarship have focused on textual analysis - for instance, Fleming Andersen's important Commonplace and Creativity: The Role of Formulaic Diction in Anglo- Scottish Traditional Balladry - and, more recently, on soci- ology and gender analysis. (Deborah Symonds's Weep Not For Me: Women, Ballads and Infanticide in Early Modern Scotland is a good example of balladry used to illuminate a historical subject from a feminist point of view.)1 At the same time, however, research into the supernatural aspects of the ballads has not been lacking. I will mention here three such studies that have some bearing on my subject: Irene Hansel Wood's essay on the folk medicine of childbirth, Sabine Wienker-Piepho's study of supernatural wives in the ballads, and Vic Gammon's essay on "Music, Charm and Seduction in British Traditional Songs and Ballads."2 However, all of these studies fall within the realm of folklore scholarship rather than literary analysis. That is, they are concerned with the origins and permutations of specific beliefs and customs in the ballads, but they do not explore the literary or thematic implications of these beliefs. It is perhaps for this reason that the theme of the animal paramour in the ballads has received so little scholarly attention. Animal paramours belong, by definition, to the supernatural Otherworld that also contains fairies, revenants, sirens, and other forms of fantastical beings. Because of this, discussion of animal paramours in bal- ladry tends to be subsumed into discussions of the supernatural in general. Yet Child's</page><page sequence="3">Goldie Morgentaler 147 collection features a distinct group of ballads in which the supernatural element is located in an anthropomorphic animal who has a sexual relationship with the human protagonist. While other kinds of animals are present in the ballads - most common- ly horses and birds - these tend to remain within the confines of the natural world, even when they possess magical attributes, such as the ability to speak (for instance, the talking parrot in Child's C, D, and F variants of "Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight" [4]). But ballads that feature supernatural animals as paramours disregard natural species boundaries and define the animal and the human spheres as capable of merg- er through sex. They thus posit a view of human nature that encompasses the notion of animality. These ballads feature both positive and negative examples of animal paramours: In ballads that define animal lovers positively, the animals belong to species that appeal to human beings, such as deer, birds, or seals. In ballads where the animal lover is presented negatively, the animals are often figured as monsters who inspire revul- sion. Monsters tend to blur the line between human and animal by embodying hor- rific exaggerations of both states. The resulting beast is thus more fantastical than real and exists exclusively within the domain of the supernatural. Animal paramours, on the other hand, are clearly recognizable as actual animals and the two states that they incorporate - the human and the animal - are nevertheless clearly differentiated. Animal paramours may be human at one time of day and animal at another, or human on land and animal in the sea or in the air, or they may have animal exteriors inhabited by human souls. Ballads that feature animal paramours define human identity not as multiple, but as dual. The supernatural creature that is half-human and half-animal stands as a reification of human potential, representing the complexity of human nature as split in two between man and beast. The sexual relationship of the human protagonists to such creatures therefore assumes both exogamous and incestuous implications. Barkan writes: "Erotic attraction via metamorphosis defines sexuality with particular force as the unfamiliar or even the uncanny. [. . .] Myths of magical change, again and again, will be stories celebrating the unfamiliar forms of the sexual impulse with all their terror and allure" (13). But magical change into animal form also embraces the familiar by establishing the consanguinity of man and beast, a relationship that may be expressed totemically by tracing direct human descent from animal forebears. Vestiges of belief in the close kinship between human and animal can be found in all cultures, suggesting that tales of sexual contact between the two states are a means of transposing an incestuous impulse into an exogamous one through intercourse with a creature who is simultaneously a projection of ourselves and yet is not ourselves.</page><page sequence="4">148 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) Some erature aspects as to of folklore. the animal Edith paramour Rogers suggests theme in that the the ballads theme may of owe the young as much woman to lit- erature as to folklore. Edith Rogers suggests that the theme of the young woman in the shape of a deer is a descendent of the mediaeval motif of the love-hunt: "One of the peculiar applications of the hunt is that of an allegory of love. The pursuit of a girl is described in the terminology of hunting - originally a learned conceit, but assimilated by the traditional poetry of many European countries" (15). Successive changes led to the identification of the game - usually a hind - with a girl. Several British ballads illustrate this motif. In "Leesome Brand" (Child 15), the identification is explicit. The young woman says to her lover as she sends him off to hunt: "Be sure ye touch not the white hynde,/ For she is o the woman kind" (Child 15A: 28). In "The Bonny Hind" (Child 50), a ballad of incest between brother and sis- ter, the identification is more symbolic. The sister commits suicide after discovering that the man who has raped her is her brother. He returns home to mourn, "But O and O for my bonny hyn [hind],/ Beneath yon hollin tree!" (Child 50: 14). One of the most moving identifications of deer and woman in British balladry occurs in "The Three Ravens" (Child 26), although, not surprisingly, it is missing from the ballad's more cynical Scottish counterpart, "The Twa Corbies." This ballad, set almost entirely within an anthropomorphic world, tells of a knight lying dead beneath his shield. The three black ravens, who function as the ballad's narrators, con- template taking their breakfast on his body, but they are thwarted by the loyalty of the hounds who lie at his feet and of the hawks who circle the air. Finally there emerges a fallow doe, "as great with young as she might goe." She takes the knight on her back, carries him to "earthen lake," and buries him before dying herself. The last verse makes clear that the doe is understood to be both human and animal: "God send euery gentleman,/ Such hauks, such hounds, and such a leman [lover]" (Child 26: 10). The ballad divides its animal figures into two sets of three arrayed around the mortal remains of the fallen knight. The three black ravens would like to tear apart the knight's body, the hounds, the hawks and the doe to protect it. The ballad thus presents in capsule form the dual role of anthropomorphic animals in balladry: On the one hand, they may be the allies of human beings, on the other, they are differen- tiated from the human world and hostile to it. The ambiguous nature of the doe in this ballad allows for a variety of folkloric, historical, and allegoric interpretations, since the ballad makes no attempt to mediate between her animal and her human characteristics. Instead, it presents her so matter- of-factly that it is scarcely possible to say whether she is intended as a woman metaphorically identified as a doe, or whether she is in fact a deer possessed of human traits.</page><page sequence="5">Goldie Morgentaler 149 Wimberly interprets "The Three Ravens" as reflecting the tradition of beast mar- riage, and rejects any more allegorical reading: "The rather symbolical character of the song is a thin disguise of what was actual belief in the animal-soul, the fallow doe in the story being none other than the faithful true-love metamorphosed. [. . .] To interpret this animal form as a bit of allegory is only one way of saying that what was matter of fact for the early mind is for us nothing more than poetry" (55). Antony Easthope reads the ballad in terms of the social relations of feudalism, seeing in the three ravens the voice of the peasantry, and in the hawks, the hounds and the doe, an idealized version of the bond between vassal and lord (83). David Fowler, on the other hand, sees in the ballad as "a secularized chivalric PietÃ " with the doe as the Madonna figure (64). Clearly both animal and human at the same time, the doe's dual identity, like that of the other animal paramours in the ballads, implies the humanity of the animal world and the animality of the human one, with distinctions between the two col- lapsed into one entity. Symbolically, the doe stands as a median not only between ani- mal and human nature, but also between such other opposing poles as birth and death, hunter and prey. The female deer, as she appears in the ballads, is commonly associated with both pregnancy and death. In both "Leesome Brand" and Child's B copy of "Willie and Earl Richard's Daughter" (Child 100) - which recounts the birth of Robin Hood - the male protagonist is sent off by the heroine to hunt "the deer and the roe" as soon as she goes into labour. In both cases, the sight of a white hind is his signal to return to his beloved. But she has died in giving birth and only the child survives. Similarly, the doe in "The Three Ravens" dies while pregnant. The hind or doe is thus associated with the tragic aspects of fecundity, and so incorporates the symbolic extremes of birth and death. The doe's pregnancy is indicative of the stress that animal-paramour ballads tend to place on reproduction. It is this aspect of the sexual relation, usually ignored in other ballads that feature supernatural paramours, that becomes significant when the Otherworld is defined as the animal world. The notion of juncture, which in the other ballads occurs at the moment of sexual intercourse, is here concentrated on the fruits of the union between animal and human, because the offspring of such a union are an amalgam of both states, thus further underlining the consanguinity of animal and human. In "The Three Ravens," the doe's death obliterates the life of her child, sug- gesting that the union of the two states is not viable. But not all of the animal-para- mour ballads are quite so pessimistic about the prospects for successful merger between man and beast, as will be seen presently in the discussion of "The Earl of Mar's Daughter" (Child 270).</page><page sequence="6">150 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) Not only does the doe in "The Three Ravens" incorporate the dual symbols of life and death, but she also functions within another metaphoric sphere, that of the hunt. In this ballad, the presence of hawks and hounds, the usual animal companions of the hunter, suggests that the slaying of the knight occurred while he was engaged in the chase. This points to the fallow doe as the likely object of the hunt. Deer hunting was traditionally considered the sport of the nobility - and the deer, along with the boar, is the most frequently hunted animal in mediaeval epics and romances (ThiÃ©baux 19). The beauty of the deer, as well as its inherent vulnerability, highlights the para- dox of the love-hunt in which the intended prey is also the beloved. The behaviour of the doe to the knight in "The Three Ravens" is full of tenderness and self-sacrifice. The doe is thus victim and redeemer, quarry and lover, animal and human. That the human "The Three in its Ravens" presentation does not of the attempt doe is to somewhat differentiate unusual. between It is the more animal common and the human in its presentation of the doe is somewhat unusual. It is more common for the ballads to distinguish the dual nature of animal paramours by literally divid- ing them into two. This is the case with "The Earl of Mar's Daughter" (270), where the lover is a dove by day and a young man by night. He has attained this double state through the magical skills of his mother, and the purpose of this metamorphosis is seduction: "I am a doo the live-lang day, A sprightly youth at night: This aye gars me appear mair fair In a fair maiden's sight." (Child 270: 13) The Earl of Mar's daughter is enchanted with the dove when she first sees him, takes him to her room, and is only slightly discomfited when he turns into a young man at sundown. She lives with him quite happily for twenty-three years, bears him seven sons, all of whom he carries away to his mother's care. When her father at length insists that she marry, and threatens to kill the dove if she does not comply, the bird flies away to his mother, amasses a bird army - including his seven sons transformed into seven swans - and returns to steal the bride on her wedding day. "The Earl of Mar's Daughter" illustrates the crucial importance of the kind of animal chosen for metamorphosis. The story here differs dramatically from that of such fairy tales as "The Frog Prince," in that the human-animal figure assumes a shape that is intended to be appealing. His metamorphosis into a dove during the day has the added advantage of masking the true nature of the animal paramour's relation- ship to the earl's daughter, so that the two may conduct a love affair right under the</page><page sequence="7">Goldie Morgentaler 151 nose of her father. Thus the innocent attachment of a young girl to a pet bird conceals an adult sexual relationship of many years standing. The animal side of the young man s nature is defined as innocent, playful, and non-sexual; his human side, on the other hand, is defined as mature, concupiscent, and potent. The heroine shares in the double nature of her lover, since her solitary attachment to her pet dove makes her appear virginal and girlish by day, sexual and maternal by night - at least until her refusal to marry arouses the anger and suspicion of her father. "The Earl of Mar's Daughter" tells a tale that ends happily for the supernatural pro- tagonist and his earthly mistress, because they are essentially in accord. She accepts the dual nature of her lover and conspires in it. In fact, it is she who initiates the sexual aspect of the relationship. And in the end, she herself makes a birdlike escape by being carried through the air to her mother-in-law's kingdom. The two lovers thus tacitly acknowledge the duality of man and beast as a tie that binds them to one another. The fact that they have seven sons, who may themselves be transformed into seven swans, underlines the ballad's assumptions about the harmonious possibilities of uniting the human and ani- mal states, and suggests the perpetuation of such possibilities into the future. Metamorphosis of the type found in this ballad, whose purpose is seduction, occurs in Greek mythology as a prerogative of the gods, while the other aspect of metamorphosis, its punitive form, is visited on mortals, so that gods and humans experience metamorphic possibility as active and passive aspects of the same process. In the ballads, the ability to change one's own shape or that of others is defined as an attribute of magical powers - most commonly associated with women. Magic, the ability to wield it, and to be transformed by it, is a power that is democratically dis- tributed. It is not exclusively the property of the Otherworld, but may be practiced by what Wimberly calls the "lay" magician, who "has recourse to the black art merely as a means of gaining her own private ends." (204). Nevertheless, what Leonard Barkan says of the Greek myths applies equally well to the ballads: "In the image of magical transformation there is always the mystery of the divine embedded in the real, the natural, the quotidian. [. . .] Metamorphosis is the moment when the divine enters the familiar" (18). Ballads present the magical as the unexceptional, and, in so doing, encompass the familiar and the extraordinary within one framework of possibility. "The Earl of Mar's Daughter" illustrates this quality of every-dayness by presenting as its central focus the relationship of a girl to her pet bird. The element of magical transformation lurking behind this seemingly innocent attachment undermines its apparent asexuality and transforms the relation- ship between human master and animal companion into something more extraordi- nary and complex.</page><page sequence="8">152 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) The as harmonious Earl of Mar's because Daughter" of the presents willingness the relationship of the heroine between to accept human a lover and animal who is as harmonious because of the willingness of the heroine to accept a lover who is both human and animal, thereby acknowledging the dual propensities of her own nature. When such an acknowledgement is lacking, however, the outcome is tragic. "The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry" (Child 113) moves inexorably towards a tragic end- ing that is dictated by the reluctance of the female protagonist to accept an animal husband. A "silkie" is a seal and Sule Skerry is an island off the northern coast of Scotland. In Britain, seals were commonly believed to have magical abilities similar to those of fairies and mermaids, and they were often associated with the latter (Beck 209). Wimberly cites a tradition that it was considered unlucky to kill a seal because it was a transformed human being (68). More to the point as far as this particular ballad is concerned was the belief among certain families in Scotland and Ireland of a totemie relationship to the seal. Seals in their human form were believed to be the progenitors of the Scottish McCodrum family and the Irish Keneellys (Beck 209). Wimberly men- tions an old Scottish woman who claimed to be the granddaughter of a seal (67). "The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry" functions as a comment on such totemie rela- tionships. The single version printed by Child contains only seven verses, which makes it an excellent example of balladry's great skill at stripping a plot to its essen- tials, incorporating past, present and future into a single narrative moment, while hinting at structural and emotional complexity that belies the brevity of the telling. The ballad opens in the present with an "earthly" nurse singing a baby to sleep with a lullaby. The lullaby makes clear that the nurse is really the child's mother, and that she has no idea who her baby's father is, nor where he comes from. No sooner has the nurse uttered her complaint than the silkie appears at her feet. He introduces him- self as "thy bairnis father," and goes on to describe himself as a creature of two parts, animal and human: 'I am a man upo the Ian, An I am a silkie in the sea, And when I'm far and far frae Ian, My dwelling is in Sule Skerrie.' ( 1 13: 3) To this she responds: 'It was na weel,' quo the maiden fair, 'It was na weel, indeed,' quo she, 'That the Great Silkie of Sule Skerrie Suld hae come and aught a bairn to me.' (1 13: 4)</page><page sequence="9">Goldie Morgentaler 153 In another version of the ballad, not found in Child, the silkie then proposes marriage, but the woman rejects him (see Leach 321). The silkie pays the woman her "nourris-fee" and demands the return of his son. He then prophesies: 'An thu sail marry a proud gunner, An a proud gunner I'm sure he'll be, An the very first schot that ere he schoots, He'll schoot baith my young son and me.' ( 1 13: 7) The dramatic centre of the ballad lies in the nurse's distress that the silkie is the father of her child, and her subsequent refusal to legitimize the union between her earthly self and the sea-dwelling sealman. By bemoaning her fate at having conceived a child by such a father, the nurse implicitly rejects any kinship with the animal world, and so separates human nature from its beastly origins. In doing so, she seals the fate not only of the silkie, but of her own son, who incorporates the qualities of both his parents. Her rejection of the silkie amounts to a rejection of the animal nature lurk- ing in the human. And her choice of a gunner as her human mate underlines the hos- tility to nature that results when the human sphere rejects any kinship with its own animal origins. "The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry" may thus be read as a cautionary tale of the destructiveness that results when man is defined as separate from nature rather than as part of it. The ballad associates the negative qualities of rejection and destruction with the human sphere, and the positive ones of acceptance and nurturing with the animal domain. The female protagonist of the ballad is identified throughout as a nurse, and is never referred to as the child's mother. In this way, the ballad underlines her alien- ation from her own offspring, a distance that is further emphasized when the silkie pays for her services. By contrast, the silkie proudly announces not only his paternity, but the manner in which he will care for his son: An it sail come to pass on a simmer's day, When the sin shines het on evera stane, That I wil tak my little young son, An teach him for to swim the faem. (1 13: 6) The earthly nurse's rejection of her child's father, and therefore of the child him- self, negates the totemie possibilities inherent in a union between human and animal. Because every child represents a merging of the qualities of its parents as well as an extension of those qualities into the future, "The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry" is, in effect, about the extinction of a hereditary line. It projects into the future the consequences of</page><page sequence="10">154 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) the nurse's rejection of her seal lover and his son, implying that the obliteration of such unions between animal and human dooms man and beast to their separate spheres and forever cuts the bonds of kinship between them. It ral is states not necessarily are depicted the as animal inimical. figure The who supernatural suffers when animal the human can be just and as supernatu- deadly to ral states are depicted as inimical. The supernatural animal can be just as deadly to mortals as the other way around, especially if the dual creature is a mermaid. Mermaids are closely associated with seals, and the stories told of seals have fre- quently been subsumed into mermaid lore, and vice versa (Beck 228). Mermaids are supposed to be beautiful and alluring; they love music, live in underwater cities, and have the ability to grant gifts. They are usually considered to be harmful to man, lur- ing him to destruction by means of their beauty or their voices. In the ballads, mer- maids are without exception the harbingers of disaster, appearing in such tragic sea- faring ballads as "The Mermaid" (Child 289) and certain versions of "Sir Patrick Spens" (Child 58). While mermaids in some respects resemble fairies, they may properly be classed with supernatural animals. They are usually depicted as hybrids; the upper part of the body is human while the lower part is fishlike. But they may also be divided environ- mentally, as is the young woman in "Clerk Colvill" (Child 42), who is entirely human while on land and a fish when in the water. The dual physicality of the mermaid and the fact that she is female underlines the dangers of her erotic appeal. It is part of the lore associated with mermaids that their response to sexual rejec- tion is to exact a terrible vengeance. "Clerk Colvill" is the story of such a rejection. The ballad opens with a conversation between Colvill and his wife, during which the wife warns him to stay away from the "well-fared may" who haunts "the wall o Stream" (42A) or "the wells of Slane" (B). Colvill assures his wife of his love for her but insists on visiting the maid. He then rides off to find the mermaid washing a silken shirt. The silken shirt is in keeping with the Northern European tradition of associating mer- maids with magical garments. The flirtatious dialogue which follows Clerk ColvilTs encounter with the mer- maid is a good illustration of the symbolic potential that ballads exploit in their use of formulaic language. He comments on her shirt; she replies that her skin is whiter than the milk. (In B, she says that his skin is whiter than the milk). The apparent non- sequitur is in fact governed by the symbolic significance of the shirt as an indicator of erotic allure. The association of white skin and milk segues naturally into the taking- the-milk- white-hand formula of the next verse. In this case, however, the expectations associated with the formula are reversed.</page><page sequence="11">Goldie Morgentaler 155 As Fleming Andersen has demonstrated, hand-taking in the ballads invariably signals the imminent rape and/or murder of the character whose hand is taken (162). Usually this is the female protagonist, since it is the man who instigates the action of taking the hand, while it is the woman who passively has her hand taken. But in this case, the formula signals the undoing of the male protagonist. This is because the impetus for the use of the formula comes from the mermaid, who is the first to allude to the traditional comparison of white skin and milk. In "Clerk Colvill," it is clear from the beginning that the mermaid is the initiator of both the narrative action and its formulaic equivalent. She thus verbally and symbolically begins the sexual drama that will end in Clerk ColvilTs death. The sexual act in "Clerk Colvill" does not represent an implicit acknowledgement of the harmony between human and animal, but rather defines the relationship in terms of differentiation between the powers of the two states. At the same time, the ballad exploits the dual identity of the mermaid as a reflection of the duality in human nature. This differentiation between animal and human is underlined by Colvill s relationship to his wife, whom he claims to love. The love for the wife falls within the human sphere, but the passion for the mermaid is animal. ColvilTs emo- tional split mirrors the duality of the mermaid. His lust for the mermaid, which over- powers his affection for his wife, is thus a surrendering to his own animal nature, and is fraught with elements of trespass. No sooner has the sexual act been consummated than Clerk Colvill is stricken by a mysterious headache. The mermaid suggests that he cut a piece from her shirt and bind it around his head as a cure. This only makes the headache worse. The shirt, which had at first been an object of attraction, becomes an agent of death. Its double function serves as a warning against dealing with creatures or objects that can be more than one thing at a time, a point which is further illustrated when Colvill tries to kill the mermaid: Then out he drew his trusty blade, And thought wi it to be her dead, But she's become a fish again, And merrily sprang into the fleed. (42: 11) ColvilTs human condition is defined by having no such powers of transforma- tion. He is limited to his single human state in the same way as he is limited to living on the land rather than in the sea. Thus, the ballad defines the human condition as one of constraint and limitation. The contrast to the supernatural variability available to the mermaid can be seen in the ballad's brief description of the wife. Ballads are</page><page sequence="12">156 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) strongly visual in their presentation of abstract notions, so the contrast between the two female protagonists, mermaid and wife, and the respective spheres to which they belong is established through articles of clothing. Where the mermaid has a shirt with multiple uses, the wife is identified by the belt around her waist, which cost her hus- band fifteen crowns. The belt emphasizes the limitation imposed by the earthly sphere, as well as the constraints attached to the marital state. By attempting to break away from the tie that binds him to his wife and to the human norm, Colvill dooms himself. "Clerk Colvill" focuses on the sexual act as the turning point in the action. Because the mermaid embodies the dangerous animality of sex, she represents a supernatural world that is both alluring and hazardous. By opting for the mermaid, Colvill commits the same transgression as the heroine of "James Harris or The Daemon Lover" (Child 243), who forsakes her carpenter husband in order to go to sea with her supernatural lover. But where in the latter ballad the supernatural element represents a search for something that transcends the human condition, because the demon lover is defined as an alien creature inhabiting a world external to the earthly sphere, in "Clerk Colvill" the mermaid s half-human half-animal make-up defines ColvilTs choice of her in retrograde terms. Colvill s forsaking his wife to go with the mermaid cannot be seen as a mystical yearning for transcendence, but rather as a step back into indulgence of the most elemental side of human nature. This is illustrated by the manner of ColvilTs death. Where in "The Daemon Lover" the agency of the wife's retributive drowning at sea is ascribed to the forces of nature, forces that are external to her physical self, in "Clerk Colvill," ColvilTs undoing issues from his own body. He dies, very prosaically, of a headache. The fact that "Clerk Colvill" uses ColvilTs own body as its punitive instrument suggests the extent to which ballads that concentrate the supernatural element in anthropomorphic animals internalize the division between the human and the other- worldly spheres. The half-human and half-animal figures who inhabit these ballads function as objectified forms of the duality of human nature. They represent the pro- jection of the animal side of man. But by virtue of the animals' otherworldly status, they also suggest the possibility that if humans are part animal, they may also be something more than human. The search for transcendence in these ballads takes place within the confines of the human psyche rather than outside it. Thus, the ani- mal-paramour ballads are concerned not only with humanity's relationship to the natural world, but also with its relationship to itself. Another being is kind transformed of magical into anthropomorphism a monster through in the the use ballads of enchantment. occurs when Such a human ballads being is transformed into a monster through the use of enchantment. Such ballads</page><page sequence="13">Goldie Morgentaler 157 define monstrosity as a form of animality exaggerated to horrific proportions. In "Allison Gross" (Child 35), the male narrator rejects the advances of an ugly witch and is himself transformed into a worm and made to "toddle" about the tree. Similarly, in "The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea" (Child 36), a brother and sister are turned into "a laily [loathsome] worm" and a mackerel, respectively, by a cruel stepmother. In the monster ballads, human and animal are not depicted as existing simulta- neously in one entity, as they are in the animal-paramour ballads, but are placed in a before-and-after relationship to the element of transformation. The monster - who is almost always female - begins as a human being, is enchanted into her terrifying beast- like state, and then must be disenchanted back into human form. And that disen- chantment must be effected through a sexual encounter with a desirable human male. The bestial hideousness of the monster's form stands as a test for the male dis- enchanter, and the ballads in which these female monsters appear define the sexual act as a heroic endeavour. In a context where the potential partner awakens repug- nance rather than attraction, sexuality comes to stand for the trial of the hero, involv- ing the suppression of disgust for altruistic purposes. Sex as a point of juncture is here distinguished by its moral quality. Self-sacrifice on the part of the male permits the deformed beastly woman to resume her former shape. Sexuality in these ballads is thus replete with redemptive connotations. "King Henry" (Child 32) opens with King Henry resting alone in a hunting lodge after a successful day at the chase. Hunting, a common activity in European ballads, is often used as a means of indicating certain important facts about the hunter, such as his rank, bravery, callousness, or state of mind. In "King Henry" the successful kill of "the fattest buck" is used primarily to establish Henry's virility, an important consid- eration in light of his ensuing experiences at the hands of the monster. As in "The Three Ravens," the hunting motif here is connected with the idea of the love-chase. The ballad's opening stanzas make the association between hunting and wooing explicit: Lat never a man a wooing wend That lacketh thingis three: A routh [plenty] of gold, an open heart, Ay fu o charity. (32: 1) As this I speak of King Henry For he lay burd-alone [solitary]; An he's doen him to a jelly [jolly] hunts ha [hall], Was seven miles ffae a town. (32: 1-2)</page><page sequence="14">158 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) Marcelle ThiÃ©baux writes that in literary depictions of the hunt, the period of the hunter's repose after the chase is has more significance than the chase itself. "The hero's exertion in the hunt, to which he has been drawn by the quarry, induces a state of dreaming receptivity. He beholds a vision that shapes his life" (19). Here is the "vision" that King Henry beholds: Her head hat the reef-tree o the house, Her middle ye mot wel span; . . . Her teeth was a' like teather stakes, Her nose like club or meli [wooden hammer]; An I ken naething she 'peared to be, But the fiend that wons [dwells] in hell. (32: 5-6) But the real measure of the monster's repulsiveness lies not in her lack of pleas- ing features, but in her appetite, which is gargantuan. That outer loathsomeness should be equaled by unbridled appetite further underlines the repellant animality of the monster - and locates her squarely within the tradition of voracious, gluttonous women that begins with the biblical Eve (Valdes Miyares 199-200). Her repeated cry to King Henry is for "mair meat." To accommodate her, he must kill first his steed, then his greyhounds, and finally his goshawks, all of whom she consumes skin and bone, leaving nothing but the hides. When thirst succeeds her hunger, Henry is told to sew up the horse's hide and bring her drink in that. In this way, the monster devours all the animals associated with the hunt, these being the outer manifestations of Henry's masculinity. She then turns to Henry himself, sexual appetite being but another form of hunger. She asks him to make her a bed, and when he has done so, she insists that he take off his clothes and lie down by her side. This is the first time that he objects: 'O God forbid,' says King Henry, That ever the like betide; That ever the fiend that wons in hell Should streak [stretch] down by my side.' (32: 17) Nevertheless, he does as he is told, and when he wakes in the morning, he finds himself lying next to "the fairest lady that ever was seen," who assures him that she will stay beautiful forever now that she has met with "a courteous knight that ga me a' my will" (32, 20: 80). The fact that the monster requires King Henry to grant every one of her wishes, no matter how repugnant, defines the war between the sexes as a contest</page><page sequence="15">Goldie Morgentaler 159 of wills. King Henry, who has been engaged in the masculine activity of hunting, is suddenly forced into a passive role by the "fiend." Her ravenous attack on his animals, followed by her sexual rapaciousness with regard to Henry himself turns the monster into a hideous exaggeration of aggressive femininity. Henry the hunter becomes Henry the quarry. The monster eats everything without distinction, and in the end attempts to "devour" King Henry himself. He remains meek throughout the ordeal, giving in to all her demands, objecting only when he is required to perform sexually. Yet he gives in to this demand as well, and by doing so ironically reasserts his man- hood and obtains the object of his desire. The ballad's opening association of hunting and wooing is expanded by its later conflation of eating and being eaten. The hunter becomes the victim of another's rapaciousness, and, by succumbing to this situation, reasserts his mastery over it and wins what must be understood as the real object of his chase - a beautiful wife. Hence the irony inherent in the notion of will. To willingly give up one's will is to get what one desires. But to submit willingly is still a manifestation of will and so, paradoxi- cally, of mastery. As for the "fiend," she cannot revert to proper human shape until all her desires have been satisfied, but her desires cannot be satisfied until she meets someone who desires to satisfy them. The paradoxes inherent in the situations of both Henry and the monster are thus entirely complementary, and suggest a balance of need and ability to fulfill the need. The juncture between opposing states that sexuality represents allows the "fiend" to cross over from the animal world of the monstrous to the idealized world of the human, at the same time as it defines both the animal and the human spheres in terms of physical extremes. If hideousness is the characteristic of the animal state, then beauty signifies the human one. Unlike the animal-paramour ballads which tended to view the animal and the human states as complementary, the monster ballads define animality as the exact opposite of the human. The union implied by the sexual act can transform a creature from one extreme to the other. In father "Kemp marries Owyne" an (Child evil stepmother 34), the heroine who has has powers lost her of mother enchantment. at a tender The age. young Her father marries an evil stepmother who has powers of enchantment. The young woman waits on her stepmother "with foot and hand." But it does her little good, and she is changed into a monster: Her breath grew Strang, her hair grew lang, And twisted thrice about the tree, And all the people, far and near, Thought that a savage beast was she. (34 A: 12).</page><page sequence="16">160 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) She cannot return to human shape until one particular man - Kemp Owyne - comes across the sea and gives her three kisses. Kissing the monster requires of Kemp Owyne the same mastery over his own fear and physical revulsion as did King Henry's more intimate act. In both ballads, physical contact becomes a flirtation with death and acts of physical intimacy usually associated with the pleasures of love-making become tests of self-sacrifice and bravery. In Child's A version of the ballad, the monster bestows three presents on Kemp Owyne in order to entice him to kiss her. The three presents will prevent Kemp Owyne from ever shedding any blood; they are the counterpart of the three kisses that will restore the heroine to physical integrity. The course of that restoration is marked by another bodily feature - the hair that had been twisted three times around the tree releases a loop with every successful kiss until it "twisted nane about the tree" (34A, 10: 5). Everything in this ballad, its theme, plot, imagery, and dramatis personae are all defined in terms of their physicality. Only the evil stepmother is given a moral tag, and of her we know only that she was "the warst woman that ever lived in Christendom" (34A, 1:4). The ballad itself is not concerned with moral qualities except as these are embedded in physical traits. The story it tells is of a falling away from physical integri- ty and a restoration to it. Thus we can see that the monster ballads idealize the human by defining it as beautiful in its feminine aspects; heroic, virtuous, and self-sacrificing in its masculine form. The animal element in these ballads threatens this definition by underlining the vulnerability of the ideal human state to transformation into its opposite. Sex is here defined by its restorative and redemptive function. It is, on the one hand, the mystery that disenchants, and on the other, a human act that reaffirms and restores the humanity of both its participants, thus invalidating the corruptive powers of evil. Monster ballads construe the sexual act as ordeal and trial, rite of purification, and symbol of the healing potential of human love. Sexuality in these ballads functions as an expression of man's ambivalence towards his own erotic nature by depicting a coming together of the loathsome, the bestial, and the grotesque with the most highly regarded human qualities - bravery, self-sacrifice, altruism. In ballads dealing with animal paramours, however, the notion of merger implied by sexual union is focused on reproduction. These ballads locate the philo- sophical ideal of union in offspring rather than in the sexual act itself, and in so doing objectify the consanguinity of man and beast. They define the inner make-up of human nature as an amalgam of the beastly and the human. When these two quali- ties are divided from each other and presented as antagonistic components, the</page><page sequence="17">Goldie Morgentaler 161 inevitable result is destruction, either of the human side of the equation as in "Clerk Colvill," or of the animal, as in "The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry." These ballads there- fore tend to define human nature in its ideal form as a harmonious acknowledgement and acceptance of the animal qualities in man. Animal paramours function as mirror reflections of human nature. If they personify the animal side of mankind, their other- worldly status also suggests the transcendent potential in human nature.
