A Classification of Recent Birds. Ernst Mayr and Dean Amadon. 1951. American Museum Novitates, 1496. 42 pp. Using as a basis the weI- estab'ished sequence of Wetmore, which is used also in the Peters Check-list, the authors have incorporated such changes which, in their opinion, are clearly indi- cated by recent evidence. The older ordinal names of Stresemann are used. The bulk of the paper consists of discussions, by systematic groups, of problems on which recent evidence has shed additional light. This is followed by the revised "Systematic List" (pp. 32-38), annotated with numbers referringf to the discus- sions of the preceding pages. Among the interesting changes are the elevation of the flamingoes to ordinal status, the placement of the Cuculi (Cuculiformes) near the galliform birds primarily because of the similarity of the turacos and galli- form birds, reduction of several shore-bird families to subfamilies, and rather extensive revision of the families of passerine birds and their sequence including the placement of the crows and "Australian crow-like" families at the end of the list. Numerous interesting comments are made on controversial relationships which are not changed in the list. It should be emphasized that this is a paper which can be studied with great profit and interest by many ornithologists other than those primarily interested in taxonomy and systematics. The previous num- ber of species oompiled by Mayr is revised downward from 8616 to 8590.- D. S. Farner. EVOLUTION (See Numbers 32, 34, and 40.) BOOKS AND MONOGRAPHS 33. Sexual Behavior in Penguins.

This book summarizes, in part, one of the most remarkable series of investigations in the history of ornithology. For more than ten years Mr. Richdale has studied closely a colony of Yellow-eyed Penguins, Megadvptes antipodes (Hombron and Jacquinot). on the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand. By means of foot-marking and banding it has been possible for him to know individually a very substantial portion of the individuals in the colony. His voluminous and painstakingly de- tailed notes have allowed the development of an understanding of the behavior of these birds to a degree scarcely realized for any other species. This treatise is confined to those aspects of behavior observed ashore which involve birds of the same or opposite sexes and which may be "aggressive" or of a "love-habit n,ature." To attempt to summarize in any way the enormous quantity of informa- tion in this attractive book is patently impossible. Few books in the field of orni- thology contain as much new information and as many new ideas. The author has refreshingly avoided anthropomorphic interpretations and conclusions although the terms employed, e. g. "divorce," "unemployed," etc., may have connotations in this respect unless the reader makes careful note that the author's definitions carefully divorce any connotations of anthropomorphism. There are chapters dealing successively with the scope of the study, an analysis of types of behavior, pair formation, sex differences, sexual behavior in winter, pre-egg stage, unem- ployed birds, incubation, chick stage, and molt. Several appendices give some of the detailed data. There are indices to subjects, authors, and bands, The photo- graphs are excellent and form an integral part of the presentation. The text is replete with comparisons with other species; particularly important are the com- parisons with other oceanic birds such as petrels, prions, and albatrosses which the author knows well from his other investigations. Perhaps the only shortcom- ing might be the failure to draw extensive comparative information from con- tinental Europe; this is to be explained primarily by the inaccessability of certain journals to the author.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXII Recent Literature 1951 RcnLieaue101 One of the most interesting masses of information is that on the duration of the pair. The author records 40 individuals whose status was known for seven to ten years. If the two members of a pair return to the colony there is a strong probability that they will remain mated. The probability of "divorce" is about 18 percent. The chapter on unemployed birds is also of great interest in that it may have implications in the studies of population dynamics in many species. The author recognizes no less than twelve classes of unemployed birds not including juveniles. The observations on their behavior are particularly interesting. These are only two isolated examples from the great wealth of information contained in this book. No ornithologist interested in any aspect of behavior can afford not to study it with the greatest of care. The University of Kansas Press is to be congratulated both for recognizing the value of publishing the manuscript and for an excellent job in the production of the book.-D. S. Farner. 34. The Hawaiian Honeycreepers. Dean Amadon. 1950. Bulletin Ameri- can Museum Natural History, 95(4): 151-262. This interesting family of birds first came to scientific notice as a result of reports by Captain Cook in 1778. There are or have been 39 distinct forms, all restricted to the Hawaiian Islands. They are here regarded as requiring only 22 species and nine genera, although earlier accounts divide the group into about twice as many genera. In contrast there were in Hawaii only six other genera, forming only seven other species of nat.ve passerine birds. An excellent brief account is given of the geology, geog- raphy and ecology of the Hawaiian archipelago. The family Drepan:idae shows relationship rather to American than to Asiatic birds, although the plant life of Hawaii is quite the opposite. Among the closest other families are the Parulidae (wood-warblers) and the related Coerebidae (South American Honeycreepers). These are passerine birds with only nine primaries, the tenth being vestigeal. The Drepaniidae usually have a tubular tongue. The nostrils are more or less covered by dorsal and ventral opercula, the bill lacks serrations or notches, palato-maxillary bones are absent and both skin and plumage possess a distinctive musky odor which persists in specimens even for decades. The first species treated is typical. It is the Ainakihi, Loxops virens (Gmelin). This is a little bird which looks and acts like a wood-warbler of the orange-crowned type, and is still fairly common in the native forests, even near Honolulu. Another interestinz species. still common, is the Apapane, Himatione sanguinea (Gmelin). This little, warbler-like beauty has black wings and tail, white undertail, but all the rest vivid crimson. The type genus, Drepanis, was represented by the "Mamo," an oriole-like bird with golden yellow rump, flanks, and bend of wing, wing coverts whitish, but all the rest glossy black. Most of the species of Drepaniidae have long been extinct, and are rep- resented by few or no specimens. What specimens do exist are commonly in bad condition, partly due to their original collection under rain-forest conditions, and occasionally due also to poor preservation. Many of the best are in the American Museum in New York. Tables of measurements of very numerous specimens are given. It has been suggested that species of such extremely isolated distribution should show very little genetic variability, but this was not found to be true for the Drepaniidae. The sexes are usually alike or very similar, but the adults differ strikingly from the immature. There is a complete post- breeding molt, often in August. The red color (Himatione) is considered to be the primitive one, that of the ancestors who first colonized the islands. Consider- able diversifications of color, shape of body, and bill, have evolved since the first immigration. The nectar-feeding habit is clearly primitive for the Drepaniidae, with their tubular tongues. A principal food plant is Metrosideros collina (Myr- taceae), the "Ohia," which is the dominant tree in most of the native Hawaiian forests. It has abundant, nectar-rich red flowers during most of the year. The songs or notes of the Drepan;idae are not as useful for their field identi- fication as is true of the songs of many mainland birds. This may reflect their comparatively recent common ancestry. Each species may give a trill or sustained song, also a plaintive whistle, and also a variety of squeaks. Their nests and eggs also indicate common ancestry; they are commonplace open nests of the wood-warbler type. with spotted cream-white eggs. The nests, as noted by Howard Cogswell, are built of rootlets, moss, and similar material, in twigs of trees or bushes, at greatly varying elevations.</page></plain_text>
