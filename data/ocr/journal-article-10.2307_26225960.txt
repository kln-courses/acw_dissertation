The best way to read and enjoy this volume is as a supplement to, and a comment on, Jerome Namias's own opera omnia (Namias, 1982). It represents, as well as cold print possibly can, the proceedings of the warm celebration organized at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California at San Diego, on 22 October 1985, for Na mias's 75th birthday (which actually occurred on 19 March). The volume starts, after the editor's brief preface, in a most appro priate way with Jerry Namias's scientific autobiography, which outlines the succession of research themes taken up and developed by the other contributors. The autobiography makes it clear how Namias stayed ahead of his time by making five-day forecasts before numerical one day forecasts were made, and proceeding to make one-month and seasonal forecasts while it was being proven that deterministic forecasts beyond two weeks were impossible. The former forecasts relied heavily on the best observational data, analysis methods, and dynamical prin ciples gathered and developed in the 1930s by C.-G. Rossby and his group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The latter forecasts rely mostly on Namias's own intimate, profound, and argumentative knowledge of the actual atmosphere and its real or imagined workings, accompanied by his sound, but not complacent, ignorance of the rel evant or irrelevant mathematics, which eventually will bear out his pioneering intuition. This chapter is completed in a useful and pleasant way with a list of Namias's 186 publications (up to 22 October 1985, I imagine, and still furiously being poured forth) and by 12 pages of photographs. The main body of the volume is made up of 10 invited contributions from leading meteorologists and oceanographers active in areas of research initiated by or of great interest to Namias. These fall naturally into three groups, relating to (1) Namias's early work on isentropic analysis, air-mass study, and jet-stream modification; (2) his research in the middle and latter years on the atmosphere's interaction with snow cover, soil moisture, and sea-surface-temperature (SST) anomalies; and (3) his enduring, true work of love in long-range forecasting (LRF). The contributions are arranged in approximately this order, and I shall review them in the published sequence. Only references not listed in the respective chapters are given here. In "The Long Range Eye of Jerry Namias," J. Smagorinsky focuses on Namias's early perception of and emphasis on the interactive in fluence of the atmosphere's lower boundary on its long-term behavior. Fourteen papers by J. Namias on this topic, published between 1948 and 1963, are discussed. Smagorinsky outlines the role of these papers in shaping our current understanding of the topic, as well as in stim ulating our continuing endeavors to improve this understanding, such as the World Climate Research Program. "A Method Pioneered by Jerome Namias: Isentropic Analysis and its Aftergrowth" is discussed by A. Eliassen, starting with Namias's pioneering papers of 1934 and 1939. The utility of isentropic surfaces and of the related Montgomery potential and potential vorticity, in the synoptic-descriptive context as well as the dynamic-stability context, are masterfully reviewed. A recent review by Hoskins et al. (1985) addresses the descriptive importance of isentropic maps, and of Elias sen-Palm fluxes on isentropic surfaces. Andrews (1984) establishes connections between the Charney-Stern stability criterion of nonvan ishing potential-vorticity gradients on isentropic surfaces and a general fluid-dynamical stability criterion by V. I. Arnol'd (1965). Even the statistical theory of quasi-geostrophic turbulence is better understood in isentropic coordinates (Sadourny, 1985). The chapter called "Residence Times and Other Time Scales As sociated with Norwegian Air Mass Ideas" is taken up by D. Fultz. He notes that the air-mass concept has somewhat fallen out of favor be © 1988 American Meteorological Society cause, I suspect, of the greater importance given over the last 30 years to detailed numerical models of the atmosphere. By contrast, in physical and chemical oceanography, water masses are still central objects of study (Ghil et al., 1987, and references therein) and have been related to potential vorticity as an identifying tracer (Rhines and Young, 1982). Fultz's careful estimation of air-mass residence times with modern data can serve as an example of such a study for slower climatic subsystems at the atmosphere's lower boundary. The third chapter in this group of contributions related to Namias's early work on "purely atmospheric" phenomena is "Global Circulation to Frontal Scale Implications of the Confluence Theory of the High Tropospheric Jet Stream," by C. W. Newton, who concentrates on two Namias papers from 1947 and 1949 (the latter with P. F. Clapp). The temporal and zonal variability of upper-level jets is related to ageos trophic, largely meridional flows in ways that are central to our current understanding of low-frequency atmospheric variability (Simmons et al., 1983; Weickmann et al., 1985). With J. E. Walsh's "Surface-Atmosphere Interactions Over the Con tinents: The Namias Influence," we proceed to a group of four con tributions related to the second major theme of the volume and of Namias's work: short-term climatic interactions between the atmo sphere and its lower boundary. Walsh treats data-based and empirical investigations, drawing heavily on the case-study approach that is Na mias's hallmark, and showing how in recent years quantitative, statis tical studies have confirmed or extended earlier insights on the interaction between snow cover and soil moisture, on the one hand, and the atmosphere, on the other. R. A. Anthes and Y.-H. Kuo use a numerical mesoscale model to study "The Influence of Soil Moisture on Circulations over North America on Short Time Scales," to wit, three days. They show the crucial role of moisture availability in generating regional features of the monsoonlike circulation over North America during summer. An interesting recent determination of interaction time scales between ground hydrology and the global circulation is that of Serafini (1987), who essentially confirms Namias's argument from the late 1950s that anomalous spring moisture can seriously influence summer drought conditions over North America and Eurasia. R. L. Haney addresses, in "Some SST Anomalies I Have Known, Thanks to J. Namias," the generation of SST anomalies (SSTAs) by atmospheric forcing. He reviews the simple stochastic-forcing models of K. Hasselmann and associates, and specific forcing mechanisms for SSTAs, including heat fluxes and momentum fluxes across the ocean surface. Atlas et al. (1987) computed these fluxes using satellite data and an atmospheric general-circulation model (GCM). Coupling be tween an oceanic mixed-layer model like the one used by Haney and an atmospheric GCM is studied by Karaça and Müller (1987). Low frequency atmospheric effects of midlatitude SSTAs are reviewed by Wallace (1987). The effects of tropical SSTAs on the tropical atmosphere are widely accepted and well understood; their effects on the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are somewhat more variable and less understood (Namias and Cayan, 1984). (It is unfortunate that the complete Namias bibliography on pages 52-59, mentioned earlier, has many references without dates, of which this is one). But the interactions between SSTAs in the Southern Hemisphere and other aspects of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are least well documented. This is the topic of H. van Loon's contribution, ' 'The Characteristics of Sea Level Pressure and Sea Surface Temperature During the Development of a Warm Event in the Southern Oscillations." Connections with Namias's work, in 1976, are made and the phenomena are described in a style more reminiscent of Namias's than in any other contribution. D. L. Gilman, now responsible for the official US National Weather Service (NWS) one-month and three-month forecasts that were initiated and conducted for many years by Namias, cautiously deals with "Ex pressing Uncertainty in Long Range Forecasts." Gilman describes the assignment of probabilities in the three classes associated with mean surface temperature—warm, near normal, and cold (or above, normal, Namias Symposium. John O. Roads, Ed. 1986. 202 pp. $6.75. Pa perbound. University of California, San Diego.</page><page sequence="2">Bulletin American Meteorological Society and below)—and with total precipitation (light, moderate, and heavy) in long-range forecasts for the continental United States. He mentions the imminent contribution of numerical extended forecasts to the cur rently still subjective and statistical LRF activity at the NWS Climate Analysis Center, and the role of lagged-average forecasting in assigning probabilities to these numerical-forecast products. A different approach to combining dynamics and statistics with synoptic intuition in LRF is the Markov chain of multiple planetary-flow regimes of Mo and Ghil (1987). E. N. Lorenz, who could unfortunately not attend the actual cele bration, writes that "The Index Cycle is Alive and Well," and that it might actually have much to do with Namias's original 1950 expla nation. He shows that the cycle, while irregular rather than truly pe riodic, is a typical manifestation of nonlinear, deterministic chaos, rather than of a linear random process (Lorenz, 1963a, b; Ghil and Childress, 1987, chapters 5 and 6). In fact, according to Lorenz, much longer-term variations of the climatic system might be caused by mech anisms similar to those associated with the two-to-four-week index cycle. The volume concludes with A. D. Hecht's award of a "Certificate of Achievement" to Jerry Namias on behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the US Department of Commerce, and contains three more pages of photographs of the participants of the 22 October 1985 symposium. The editor, John Roads, deserves our thanks for his efforts in or ganizing the celebration and for producing this interesting and useful volume. I recommend it to all libraries with atmospheric, oceanic, or climatic collections, and to any reader with research interests in these fields. At $6.75, it's a steal. But in order to learn to truly love the atmosphere and all that influ ences it the way Jerome Namias does, to understand it on a personal, anthropomorphic basis, and to write about it the way Namias does, you have to turn to his own writings. Please keep at it, Jerry; we need your example and your inspiration if you want us to make your dream of long-range forecasting come true.—Michael Ghil Michael Ghil is a professor of atmospheric sciences and geophysics at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the director of its Climate Dynamics Laboratory.
