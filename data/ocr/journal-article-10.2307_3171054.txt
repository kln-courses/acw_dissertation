Jorge Silvetti Four Public Squares in the City of Leonforte, Sicily Initial Remarks The practice of introducing one's own projects in an attempt to "orient" (to bias, to control, to persuade) the viewer's reading and interpretations, to produce a frame around the projects so they are seen in their best profile, and to do all those things that characterize such presenta- tions, to me has become very suspect. I prefer only to di- gress about some issues I believe my projects may raise and that I hope interest the viewer. But this mode of exposition (aside from the obvious constraints of space), is better left for a chat than a piece of writing. In the particular case of the project presented here, such uneasiness is compounded by the fact that my only over- riding intention in writing about it would have been to persuade the reader not to see this project as site or context bound, as the products of my Sicilian sojourn, or as a particular response to a particular place with a particular history. Rather, I would prefer to convince the reader that it is about something else more general in architecture - that whatever issue it may raise, this project is not just concerned with its locale and particular history. But then, how does one avoid such a reading when looking at it from thousands of miles away, in the center of an island profoundly marked by the history of all great Mediterra- nean civilizations and that ostensibly displays a most idio- syncratic and distinctive culture? I suppose I would have aimed at this impossibility, not because the relationships that this project has with the Sicilian context and history 55</page><page sequence="2">.... ......i .... . .... ......... :... .... ... ............................... ........... iiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiii~ iii i~iii. ..  iiiiiiiiiii~ i. .. ... ....................... i iiiii~i~i!iiiiii~i~ ~iii~ iiiiiiiii~~i~~ii~iiiiiii~~i~~i .....ii . . ...ii~i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~mxiiy</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 1 are unimportant, but precisely because I believe that in the general picture - in any project - such relationships are inevitable, and I feel that concern about the nature of such relationships has in the last decade unduly dominated the discussion about architecture at the expense of other themes and ideas. It is time, then, to recognize this fact and to concentrate on other, more intricate, complex, and interesting issues. But then, that being a suspect task com- pounded by an impossibility, allow this project to be a Sicilian Project and the drawings and model to speak for themselves. What I can do, however, is provide a parallel discourse that points out my preoccupations by asserting some be- liefs, some of which are contemporary with the project and some of which are not. First let me say that I have lost interest in the discussion about style, about classicism, and about iconography as moral issues. They are not. Insofar as we have understood the somewhat arbitrary relationship between architectural forms and ideas, issues concerning iconographic motives and the appropriateness or validity of a particular style ver- sus another have for me become purely technical issues. While a few years ago some of us accepted the notion that architecture is typologically indifferent to function (via Rossi), we may now have to recognize architecture's stylis- tic indifference to typology. Second, at the same time, while we recognize that struc- tural arbitrariness, we must still insist that choices are motivated, that the production of architectural form recognizes an origin and has a purpose, and that it is goal oriented. Current architectural nihilisms for me are conceptual impossibilities. Just to make sure, let me reiter- ate that architecture happens in things external to the mind, in artifacts that we call, more often than not, build- ings, which are the result of a decision to make them and to make them do some things defined a priori irrespective of whatever new things, purposes, or discoveries one may find in the process of making them or in experiencing them. And third, on mentioning process, while it is still crucial to emphasize that architects do not build buildings but do drawings (in order to prevent the erasure of the actual locus of the creative moment and to avoid its repression), I need to add that drawings are not an end in themselves but rather a delirious, pregnant, and intermediate step that addresses something that does not exist yet. In an architec- tural drawing, I continue to see through the paper and into the imagination. Which is to say that these drawings are about a project, and most of all, they are two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional things that want to ex- ist, that are concerned with space and its occupancy, with materials, dimensions, and the human body, with gravity, and with the fact that they will be seen by the eyes of many, moving about them in a particular location, that is, the town of Leonforte in Sicily. This brings us back, fourth, to Sicily, history and context. In relation to this project, and, I should hope, for all proj- ects after it, my encounter with Sicilian culture - mar- ginal and immense, profound and original, hybrid and projective - helped me if anything to free myself from the burdens of history and context. Confronted with the unre- pressed, creative excesses and antidogmatism that charac- terize its artistic enterprise, as manifested today in the silence of the monuments that crowd its land and that collapse millenia of bold figurative experimentation in one view of simultaneous tableaux, the only thing I felt obliged to respect, abide, and follow was its attitude of exploration and inquiry (about architecture, about form, about culture) without inhibition. 56</page><page sequence="4">Silvetti 1.

Leonforte In 1983 the city of Leonforte, Sicily, commissioned us to prepare a proposal for the redesign of four "piazzas" in the present-day center of the town. Leonforte is a paradigmatic Mediterranean "citth di fondazione" (new town) of the seventeenth century that displays a remarkable urbanistic idea and a strong individual character. Founded by the en- lightened Prince Nicol6 Placido Branciforti by permission of the King of Spain, its layout of 1610 reflects a learned intellect and the humanist concerns of the times behind its planning. Structured along a linear axis that corresponds to a natural valley, it is anthropomorphic in its tripartite organization of Head: Palazzo Branciforti, piazza, stables, and cathedral. Umbilicus: Piazza del Mercato (today Piazza Margherita). Feet: Gate to Catania. These three characteristic points along the axis are exactly determined by golden section ratios. Toward the west, the city overlooks its own agriculturally productive valley, the gate and antique road to Palermo and the rival towns of Enna and Calascibetta. Toward the east, the old city walls and the gate open to the "Piano della scuola" (equestrian school's fields) and the road to Catania. During its first two centuries, Leonforte owed its wealth to an unusual abundance of water from natural springs, which allowed not only excellent irrigation but also the operation of many water mills that provided energy for industries. Indeed, the humanist Prince Branciforti made water a theme of the town and built its most memorable monument, La Gran Fonte, and, adjacent to it, one of the first botanical gardens, both directly below the imposing mass of the palace. The Gran Fonte is a complex, monu- mental, multifunctional artifact that acts as a public fountain with its twenty-two continuously running spouts organized in a line; as a trough for beasts; as an optical device with twenty-two windows whence to observe the valley and the cities beyond from the most dramatic point in the city; and as the first monument encountered by the visitor when entering the city from the gate to Palermo. This unusual functional juxtaposition of providing water, of viewing, framing, and organizing the landscape, and 57</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 1 3. The Gran Fonte. 4-7.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Leonforte grew outside its walls according to typical and pragmatic European expansion patterns. This particular moment established some unstructured open spaces that are the concern of this project, the leftovers of the great equestrian school ("Piano della Scuola") that the Prince ran and that added to the fame of the town in seventeenth century. Coinciding with the loss of power and economic base at the turn of this century, the modern expansion followed an indifferent planning strategy, which resulted in the shift of activities and services to the new areas, with a new center developing around Piazza Carella and the subsequent de- cay of the historical center. The Project Programmatically, the city asked only for the "sistema- zione" (reorganization and redesign) of the four existing public spaces, and very little was specified other than that all civic and recreational meetings of importance take place today in the major square, Piazza Carella. Also it was pointed out that the weekly market of produce takes place in the vicinity of the piazza adjacent to the small church of San Francesco (southwest of Piazza Carella) and that it will continue to do so, but that no permanent structure should be provided for it as the market works perfectly with 58</page><page sequence="6">Silvetti 8.

It was also suggested that an outdoor space for performing arts be considered. In addition, on our part the intention was to propose an intervention, with the modest architectural means at our disposal, that would help initiate a process of reintegration and regeneration of the old center. We proceeded by elaborating and structuring a plan based on visual and formal characteristics of the existing condi- tions, which followed not from an analysis concerned with abstract operations on a two-dimensional pattern but rather from an analysis of the visual sight lines of actual signifi- cance for the understanding and reading of the town as well as of the architectural and urban attributes that we found already active or implicit. This analysis left us with a net of interrelated axes and nodes that constitute the armature of the project. Parallel to this, an analysis of the typology and iconogra- phy of the architecture of the city provided guides for the figurative choices we were to make regarding the architec- ture of the four piazzas. The simplest and most memorable forms that inform the symbolic and iconographic program of Leonforte are unmistakably: The Square: Cube (Palazzo Branciforte) The Rectangle: Prism (Piazza Branciforte and tables) The Circle: Cylinder (Piazza del Mercato, today Margherita) 59</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 1 10-13.

Dimensions and rhythms of existing building typology as generators of urban form. 13. The structuring armature and nodes of the proposed intervention. In this new Leonforte of the twentieth century that is char- acteristically two dislocated cities (the historical center and the modern expansion), those forms are reintroduced in the proposed intervention as counterpoints or echoes of the existing ones, as emerging volumes built out of red granite (the new Piazza Carella, the Piazza del Piano della Scuo- la, and the Piazza del Mercato Nuovo). As they "emerge" as three-dimensional figures from the ground, they reveal a substratum of water that reestablishes in the modern sector of the town the presence of Leonforte's once most impor- tant resource. Iconographically, the long circuslike piazza of the Piano della Scuola is dedicated to the equestrian traditions of the city, and statues of horses orient the passerby toward im- portant urban nodes. The New Market piazza is a reenact- ment, in both function and form, of the old Piazza del Mercato with its round fountain that serves as head of the weekly market. Its location is determined by the diagonal axis generated by the present-day entrance to the center of town. In Piazza Carella, Leonforte's most important and representative gathering place today, the idea of "public space" is monumentalized in the emerging red granite cube whose precise disposition is generated by the only facade in the area (Palazzo Carella) capable of structuring a public space. As for the Piazza SS. Annunziata, its almost enclosed nature and strong sloping grounds suggested the outdoor space for the performing arts. It is there that our project's most important architectural element is located - The Tower of Leonforte, at a node determined by the intersec- tion of the old baroque axis with another generated by the new focus in the new Piazza Carella. Because of its precise location and configuration, this tower reinvents the city of Leonforte singlehandedly: first, by being a new monument of extraordinary attributes, ever present and visible from key points of the city, and, second, by being a complex and multifunctional artifact from which the city can be known again, understood, and reassembled creatively in the beholders' minds. The remaining pieces of architecture in the piazzas are supporting elements, such as the flanking pavilions of Piazza Carella, the outdoor theater stage, the new com- mercial building in Piazza SS. Annunziata. All are transformations and variations of the historical house/store building type that constitutes the unit of the fabric of Leonforte: a square (approximately eight meters by eight meters), three-story-high unit that can be isolated or aggre- gated in many possible combinations and that marks its angles with an overscaled corner stone pillar. 60</page><page sequence="8">Silvetti" Lii x In .. c d t-em- 14.

It is effectively two cities, and this fact is vividly expressed by the collision of their two grids. In proposing an intervention in the mod- ern expansion we also wanted to deal with this dislocation and to address the issue of the regeneration of the histori- cal center. From early analyses we identified a node of particular im- portance next to the Church of SS. Annunziata. There, the main axis of the old city and a perpendicular axis com- ing from the new focus of Piazza Carella coverged. In this node we plan to locate an extraordinary artifact that is the analogue to the Gran Fonte. Like the Gran Fonte it is a fountain, a viewing artifact, and monument, and like the Gran Fonte, which appears as a city wall, displaced from its more normative configurations, it appears in an unex- pected building type, a tower. The architecture of the tower is concerned with quantity and dimensioning, issues rarely addressed in architecture; having as its overall program that of being a monument, this architecture is required to be typologically clear and to display some extraordinary quality. It is this "extra" that poses the quantitative question, which is here answered by following the internal logic of the building type: if the spe- cific physical attribute of a tower is that of being a building that displays a dominance of the vertical dimension over the horizontal (as opposed to the "wall", i.e., La Gran Fonte), its specific functional attribute is to provide a unique view by positioning the eye at an unconventional location; thus, the Tower of Leonforte becomes "extraordi- nary" by exaggerating its characteristic function and by producing its effects in excess. As one ascends the stair, telescopes and viewing devices that pierce through the walls focus the visitor into specific and important events of the town. So, as the Gran Fonte performed the added task of relating the town with its productive valley and the be- yond by means of its controlled framing of the landscape, the tower reunites a dislocated, twentieth-century Leon- forte by "bringing together" its most important monuments and urban events. Conversely, given its particular location it is also to be seen from the most important parts of the city. Arriving at the summit, the visitor emerges upon the "island" surrounded by water that fills the fountain to the rim (and that at rare times may spill over the main fagade). It is constructed scientifically, according to the laws of op- tics and perspective, and can accept new viewing devices as long as new monuments or memorable urban events are built or recognized. It is made of local tufo stone and cor-ten steel. It measures 24.60 meters, which is the exact dimension of the Gran Fonte, and records this fact by engraving the traces of the fagade of the Gran Fonte in its full size on the surface of the tower's least public side.
