Jim Kenny. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 400 pp ?10.99 pb 0 7171-2673-0. A few years ago Jim Kemmy, a La bour td who died just as this book went to press, produced a remarkably successful Limerick An thology, and there seemed to be nothing omitted on the history, lore, lives and physical features of Limerick. Which just goes to show you should never say "thus far and no further," for this se quel, which draws also on Limerick (county as well as city) in fiction and poetry, offers nearly 250 more varied excerpts and pieces arranged under headings like politics, travellers, the stage, sport, religion and so forth. Who needs Dublin? What possible use is Cork? ** -*&gt; ? * // ART Irish Arts Review Yearbook volum 14 1998. ed. Homan Potterton. Irish Arts Review. 282 pp inc. advertisements ?22.50 pb 30 x 21 cm 0-9523876-7-0; hb ?35 -6-2; ISSN 0791-3540. Who would have guessed that Van Gogh's 'Po tato eaters' was inspired by the work of Aloysius Kelly? It is one of many intriguing lights in this annual with its articles on visual arts, architec ture and craftsmanship, together with book re views, an interview with the new7 Arts Council director, illustrated diary of the art year, and?no doubt all-important to some?auction records and art price guide. Of particular interest to our readers, perhaps, is Bernard Meehan on the ninth-century Book of Armagh, with some fine reproductions, and on present-day artists there are major illustrated articles on Rita Duffy and James Coleman. As we annually remark, it is above all for the collector, amateur and dealer, but no less interesting and valuable for that. * * Modern Art in Ireland. Dorothy Walker. Lilliput Press. 239 pp ?25 hb 28 x24 cm 1-874675 77-5 (de luxe -96-1). A critical and 'political' ac count of the growth and entrenchment of mod ernist visual art in Ireland?and among some exiles?from the 'hothouse' that was neutral Ire land 1939-45 to the present day when "the visual artists are no longer confined to the gate lodge of the literary Big House". Indeed the literary avant-garde are few, while most painters and sculptors are out on limbs that publishers wouldn't dare support. The book is generously illustrated with a reproduction per page on aver age, but it is essentially not a picture book wTith self-justifying or supporting text, but a major il lustrated essay by a major (and involved) critic and historian. Bibliography and index. * Profile 3 - Eilis O'Connell. ed. lohn O'Re gan, Gandon. 48 pp ?7.50 pb 23 x 23 cm 0-946641 87-0. Critique by Caoimhin Mac Giolla Leith and interview with the artist by Medb Ruane, plus colour photographs of the works (mostly in steel or other metals) of a lady born Derry in 1953, who thinks that a beautiful scuplture is a vacuous sculpture, pursues excitement among other things, and lives and works in London. Though most of her solo shows seem to have been in Ire land, her commissioned and collected sculptures are all over the place. *+ * // Profile 4 - Siob?n Piercy. ed. John O'Regan. Gandon. 48 pp ?7.50 pb 23 x 23 cm 0-946641-90 0. A critique by Aidan Dunne and an interview between the artist and Vera Ryan, with twenty colour reproductions (and some monochrome) of her very interesting prints. Born in 1957, she has had a number of major exhibitions and awards, and is represented in many collections. William Blake is mentioned, and Piercy's dreamlike sym bolism does seem to share something of his. You'd think pages with white type on solid gold ink would look precious, but they seem quite ac ceptable. ** ^ // AUTOBIOGRAPHY The New Curate, christy Kenneally Mercier. 142 pp ?6.99 pb 1-85635-199-8. Those who en joyed Maura's Boy (1966 on his childhood) will no doubt leap at his memoir of how, newly or dained and unfamiliar with death, he became chaplain to 'the Incurable' hospital in Cork. Born 1948, Christy didn't stay in the priesthood long and his now a married and familied communica tions consultant. He's certainly a natural commu nicator. ** ?! / Out of Sight. Joe Bollard. Wolftiound Press. 190pp + 8 ofphotos. ?7.99 pb 0-86327-623-7. The story of an inner-city Dublin-born (1930+) man wrho became blind when he was two and whose large family moved to Liverpool when he was four. Though he wTon a scholarship to a college, his family's poverty and the pride of the nuns who ran his school (he kept winning a braille reading trophy) meant he had to be trained as a mat-maker. He returned to Ireland as pianist with a band, from that got into radio and is now a successful and familiar broadcaster. He edits the Irish blind people's audio magazine and has undertaken cycle rides (as back legs of a tandem) for charities all over the world. A nice looking book wThich will surely fulfil his wish to help sighted people understand the blind better, and blind people realise how fulfilled and happy some of their number can be. Lovely cover photo of Joe and his labrador helper. ** -* Special Intentions. Mary Pat Kelly. New Is land. 380 pp ?6.99 pb 1-874597-71-5. Story of the Chicago nun of the sixties who became a media person, and whom Shirley Kelly interviewed in our last issue. *+ &gt;fo ;fc // Vingt ans de jeunesse. Maurice O'Sulli van. Terre de Brume, Kennes. 256 pp 129 francs pb 2-84362-005-8. Labelled 'roman' (novel) this is a translation not directly of Piche Blian ag Fas by Muiris ? S?illeabh?in but of its English transla tion, and following the strange convention that names may be translated, the English co-transla tor becomes 'Georges' Thomson in the foreword by the French one, Raymond Queneau. The pub lishers' 'Bibliotheque irlandaise' (they specialise in Celtic titles) is of exceptionally handsome edi tions in an unfamiliar narrow format. So far it also includes Walter Macken's Et Dieu fit le di manche and a collection of essays Une saison en Mande by Bernard Berrou, with Dunsany and James Stephens on the way. ? / biography Hanna Sheehy Skeffington: a life. Mar garet Ward. Attic (Cork University Press). 392 pp ?45 hb 1-85594-179-1; pb ?14.95 -187-2. A?in deed surely the?major biography of an impor tant and interesting character, "militant republi can, ardent feminist and natural anarchist" as an acquaintance discovered of the elderly lady who "looked like somebody's respectable great aunt". He might have added, as the author does, "avowed pagan". She was married to Frank Sheehy Skeffington (they took each other's names), the pacifist who was murdered by a mad army man during the 1916 Rising. No better qualified biographer could be wanted than Mar garet Ward, who has researched from family pa pers and other such sources. The book itself looks a bit intimidating; though the pages are clean and well margined, the type is small (one does not expect such economy at ?45) and notes are in clogging drifts at the end of the chapters. Most curiously the 12 pages of photographs are also in clusters as if inserted sections of art paper, but they are on the text paper so could have been scattered, and certainly their pages should have been numbered. As we went to press a fax arrived to tell us what we had guessed from this book: that the Attic Press, Ireland's only feminist pub lisher, has died after twenty years and is now an imprint of Cork UP, who have the stock of back titles and will produce new ones. The jacket of this is a shock?an old photograph jollied up with kelly green and lobster pink. You wouldn't fail to notice it. * -* * James Connolly. J. L. Hyland. Dundalgan Press for Historical Assocn of Ireland. 68 pp ?6 pb 0-85221-134-1. No. 11 in the Life and Times se ries. A new look at the much-written-about so cialist and republican martyr, which tends to show his developing ideology as 'original and radical' and his public actions as consistent with it. In putting a 'good value' sign on this and oth ers in the series (Tone and Murphy below) we are making the point that the historians who can pre sent much research and skill into a compact and succinct account are giving better value than their more prolix brethren. * * * / Sean Lemass, the enigmatic patriot. John Horgan. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 436 pp + 8 of photos. ?19.99 hb 0-7171-2079-1. The Taoiseach at the critical epoch between tired, poor old Ireland of the fifties, the Emergency, the economic war and the rest, and the exciting economic turnaround of the sixties, Lemass (1899-1971) had in tact fought in the 1916 Rising. He was Minister for Industry in each Fianna Fail government from 1932 to 1959. Horgan's list of interviews and of manu script sources is impressive, and this big book should do for a big?but essentially modest? man for a long time to come. ++ * Secret Lotto Lives : amazing true stories of Ireland's Lotto millionaires. P. J. Gibbons. Mentor. 236 pp ?5.99 pb 0-947548-83-1. Even those of us who refuse to subscribe are fascinated by the thought of sudden riches and what it would do to our lives. Journalist Gibbons has gone to great lengths to find and interview the (mostly unlucky) winners and gives good value with all sorts of snippets, and a chapter on the whole phenomenon. It's compulsive, unfortu nately, and cleverly got up to look it. *+ n I GANDON for credit card orders of ART BOOKS - same-day despatch I H Oysterhaven, Kinsale, Co Cork - tel +353 (0)21-770830 / fax 770755 I</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND December 1997 349 Theobald Wolfe Tone. Thomas Bartiett. Dundalgan Press for Historical Assocn of Ireland. 97 pp ?6 pb 0-85221-133-3. No. 10 in the Life and Times series. Timely re-examination of the totem figure, placing him firmly in context of time and political movement "while recognising the im portance of his legacy to later Irish history" which is perhaps code for a bit of demythologis ing? Like others in the series (Connolly above, Murphy below) this provides a useful chronol ogy. * * -* * S T. M. Healy. Frank Callanan. Cork University Press. 792 pp ?15.95 pb 1-85918-172-4. A great thumping paperback of the exhaustive study that Tony Canavan reviewed for us only in Sep tember. Healy, ambitious and never really ful filled, was the great traitor to Parnell, and sur vived those days to become the Governor General of the Free State, so his life spans the most critical period of Irish history. Full scholarly paraphernalia and a verv striking cover. * * / Voices of Cork. Vincent Power. Blackwater. 2S8 pp ?14.99 hb 0-86121-936-8. Interviews with eighteen notable Corkonians by an Examiner journalist who was born in Limerick of all places. Invidiously we mention Sonia O'Sullivan, Bren dan O'Brien, Alice Taylor, John A. Murphy, Darina Allen, Noel C. Duggan, Fergal Keane, Fiona Shaw and Ben Dunne but really they're all equally interesting, Bernard Mortell's jacket manages to get remarkable likenesses of all of them into one bit of artwork. An obvious easy gift for Cork people. * -* # / William Martin Murphy. Thomas Morris sey SJ. Dundalgan Press for Historical Assocn of Ireland. 93 pp ?6 pb 0-85221-132-5. No. 9 in the Life and Times series. Murphy (1845-1919), was an anti-Parnell industrialist (and would-be poli tician) who bought the Irish Independent news paper in 1900. As employer and president of Dublin Chamber of Commerce he led the lock outs in response to the strikes of 1911-13, and the Irish Independent was said to have been instru mental in the execution of James Connolly (the subject of another booklet in this series, see above) after the 1916 Rising, though this book is at pains to disculpate Murphy himself, who was strongly agains conscription and later against partition. The author admits that his subject still remains 'two-dimensional' because of lack of material about a very private and reserved public figure. ** BREWING The Murphy's Story : the history of Lady's Well Brewery Cork. Diarmuid ? Dris ceoil and Donal ? Drisceoil. Murphy Brewery, disirib. Mercier Press. 164 pp ?20 hb 26 x 21 cm 0-9531431-0-4. You wouldn't think from Re quiem for a Family Business (below) that any other brewery in these islands had brewed stout in living memory (though the name Mackeson is mentioned once). From this immaculate PR product, in the best modem tradition of colour magazine or album, you wouldn't know Guin ness was more than some minor local competitor. It looks a good and entertaining history of the thick and thin survived by a family business. No expense has been spared, but it's all in very good taste. Bibliography and index. ** / Requiem for a Family Business. Jonathan Guinness. Macmillan. 398 pp Stg?20 hb 0-333-66191-5. The author, the third Lord Moyne, was born in 1930 and was a non-execu tive director (at ?4,000 a year!) of the family brew ery business when the great scandals of which he writes exploded in the late eighties: indeed he was involved in them since he supported the ap pointment of new broom ('deadly') Ernest Saun ders and stood by him rather longer (as he now admits) than he should have?or does he admit that? There is a touch of apres-arriere-pensee in the book which argues that 'artificially' support ing share values was the norm in those days, that it was Margaret Thatcher's over-touchiness about morality in a free market that made whis tle-blowing necessary and that Saunders was simply scapegoat. Though mostly fascinating to the layman, there are places in the book where financial technicalities get out of hand. Do you understand "Boesky , . . unwound a short posi tion in Guinness?" Luckily you get a parenthetic explanation: "he bought back Guinness shares he had sold without owning them in the first place". Ha! Photos, index. % / CONTROVERSY The Amazon Journal of Roger Case ment, ed. Angus Mitchell. Lilliput Press. 534 pp ?20 pb 1-901866-07-6 (hb ?40 -08-4). This and the following book are parts of a collision?or a part ing of the ways?between two scholars. The edi tor of this book became convinced while reading Casement's personal papers in the National Li brary of Ireland?an archive which he says has been almostly totally overlooked?that the Black Diaries were forged as part of a 'brilliant but sin ister scheme hatched by British intelligence to prevent him attaining martyrdom'. But this is not his main purpose in editing and publishing Case ment's day-by-day account of his investigations into the Putumayo atrocities. He points out that the Amazon and Congo basins are still the scene of cruel crimes that are historically related to those exposed by Casement, so there is a present day agenda, as well as the desire to reinstate Casement as a humanist hero. He makes the point too that Britain was implicated in the cru elty of the rubber trade. Angus Mitchell refused to do a double act with Roger Sawyer (editor of the next book) as was first intended, whereby they were to get equal space to put forward the arguments respectively for and against the black diaries being forged, and has gone it alone with this edition of the 1910 journal?much fuller than the one that follows and apparently more care fully edited?on the basis that since he believes the black diaries are forgeries, there is no point in reproducing them. * * A&gt; / Roger Casement's Diaries, 1910 : the black and the white, ed. Roger Sawyer. Pimlico. 288 pp Stg?10 pb 0-7126-7375-X. This repro duces selected entries from both the black and the white diaries for 1910?that is for the same pe riod as is covered more fully in the book above. The black diary has not appeared in print before, having been open to the public only from 1994. Sawyer is the author of Casement: the Flawed Hero (1984), of books on slavery and of 'We Are But Women': women in Ireland's history. His is your book if you want to engage in the contro versy, and it will probably convince you that Casement was simultaneously an immoral or amoral pederast ('gay' doesn't seem quite right) and a moral hero. If you want the white diary in much fuller form, but no significant evidence on the controversy, then the previous book (Mitchell) is for you. * A&gt; * // CRITICISM As the Poet Said . . . ed. Tony Curtis and Dennis O'Driscoll. Poetry Ireland, Dublin Castle, Dublin 2 (British distrib. The Poetry Society). 119 pp ?6.99 pb 1-902121-00-7. From the 'Pickings &amp; Choosings' column in Poetry Ireland Review, a fascinating selection of dicta, quips, bons mots, one-liners etc. on poets and poetry in particular and in general, helpfully arranged by subject like (poetry and) critics, sex, politics, anthologies. Fa mous Seamus gets a chapter to himself. Apart from being diverting reading for waiting room or lavatory, this shows how differently we all regard poetry: how seriously often, and how we are will ing at the drop of a stanza to explain to the world what is and what is not poetry with much more conviction than we bring to ethics or theology.

Collection of essays on differ ent aspects of Bram Stoker's horror classic and tangential themes, including a note on Stoker's life and work, his Dublin connections and vam pire superstitions in general. Also there's the first appearance in print of an Irish translation of 'Dracula's Guest' by our Gaelic Editor?what our staff get up to when we're not looking! There's a bibliography and filmography, and the whole is got up with illustrations, decorations and a transylvanian cover calculated to catch the bookbuyer's eye?incidentally it also repro duces the Dracula stamps issued this year, which feature the fair name of Eire in pseudo-Saxon black-letter for the first (and we trust last) time ever. ** A #/ ECONOMICS International Perspectives on the Irish Economy, ed. Alan W. Gray. Indecon Economic Consultants, Wellington Quay, Dublin 2. 179 pp IR?/Stg?12 I $15 hb 0-9531318-0-7. A sympo sium of eight economists from USA (a majority), Britain, Germany and Spain look for the reasons or explanations for Ireland's recent economic turnaround, what problems remain, and what risks lie in maintaining growth?and of course finally what policies we should pursue. Though clearly a professional job, we think this looks di gestible to the reasonably intelligent and politi cally active. Source notes and index. The jacket is a specially commissioned painting by Tony O'Malley, and?surely unusual for a book of eco nomics??Yeats is quoted up front: "All things hang like a drop of dew / Upon a blade of grass."

A&amp;A Farmar. 280 pp inc. advertisements. ?9.99 pb 1 899047-31-X with separate brochure 'pocket book'', 26 pp. Now a well-established annual with con tributions on every imaginable aspect by experts and 1,200 listings of recommended wines that have been blind-tasted by a panel of connois seurs. It's getting to be a more substantial book than can be easily pocketed or handbagged, so an accompanying booklet is provided which, apart from relisting a few of the selected wines, is sim ply an index to the bigger book, the rationale be ing that you mark in it what takes your fancy and then have it handy as a shopping list or at a res taurant. ** * // Conrad Gallagher's New Irish Cooking.

We're drinking a lot more wine in this country than we used to, and the variety available has increased enormously, but research suggests that our buying habits are essentially conservative and dogged in particular by the no tion that white wine can only be enjoyed with fish, red wine with meat. In addition to shattering that myth once and for all, this book, from one of our leading food and wine writers, shows how the best matches are achieved by combining the wines and cooking of a particular region. There's a table of classic varietals with the kinds of food that best complement them, advice on choosing wines in restaurants, and seventy recipes, includ ing a section on wine-friendly desserts. ** GENEALOGY The Royal O'Connors of Connaught. Patrick O'Connor. Old House Press, Swinford, Co Mayo. 80 pp ?7 pb 0-9529928-1-7. A remarkably detailed account of the holders of the name from the earliest known through the various eminent ones of history and the families of the O'Connor Dons, O'Connor Roes and those of Sligo, distilled from The O'Conors of Connaught (1891) and other later books, with family trees and some notes on their estates. The author confuses crest with coat of arms (a common mistake), so is not too reliable on heraldry. * * * HEALTH Healing Herbs in Ireland. Paula O'Re gan. Primrose Press, PO Box 5582, Blackrock, Co Dublin. 145 pp ?6.95 pb 0-9529878-0-5. A pleas ant and thorough-going book, rather old-fash ioned in style, that provides a history of health lore and instruction on growing and using herbs that grow in Ireland and on essential oils, as well as on diet, with lists of which herbs contribute which vitamins and elements. Part 2 goes the other way about it, illustrating and describing herbs and wild flowers and detailing the uses of each. There are addresses of health-food stores (Republic only), a bibliography and index. A more complete and user-friendly guide would be hard to imagine. ** S*f HISTORY The Impact of the Anglo-Normans on Munster. A. R O'Brien. Gandonfor Barryscourt Trust. 32 pp ?4.95 pb 0-946641-83-8.

Facsimiles of all the main docu ments in the RIC's secret file on Collins from De cember 1916 to April 1920, now released by the British Public Record Office for the first time, and including the reports of undercover police. They are introduced by a 36-page narrative, well illus trated with photos.

A facsimile of the extraordinary set of records published in 1852?only five years after the height of the Fam ine?which in itself is testimony of the diligence and care for detail typical of the Quakers, as well as of what was in some cases and places the only effective relief work. The title verso states this is an 'exact facsimile' but there's a useful new intro duction by Joan C. Johnson and Robin B. Good body and?praise be!?an index, while the title page is modified and the following twenty pages of the original are cleverly replaced and filled by the new material so that the original pagination holds.

Fifteen academics were invited to explore the ways in which women's history chal lenged their understanding of Irish history, and another produced a bibliography of the works of the pioneer feminist, historian and nun to whom the book is dedicated. By way of good example to other producers of symposia, the source notes are all tucked away at the back end, and there's a good index. See also a rather similar book under Sociology below; that strays into history a bit, as this does into sociology. * * &lt;/ HISTORY INSTITUTIONAL The 'B' Specials : a history of the Ulster Special Constabulary.

Ironic that this arrived just as we published (last month) a review7 of four books about policing in Ireland. This was first publish ed in 1972 and is a rather crowded paperback.

In 1876 (no not Boston 1997) a judge suddenly and without apparent reason changed a conviction for mur der to one of manslaughter, and it is said (third hand) that this was because he was haunted by the wrongful hanging?the last public execution in Nenagh?of William and Daniel Cormack eighteen years earlier. Public opinion and lore were certainly persistent that the Cormacks were innocent of the death of a land agent, and in 1910 their remains were dug up and reburied with all the rites of the church and great public demon strations. The case, we're told, has been the sub ject of a play, a radio documentary and a novel, and here is exhaustively researched and re counted?though the evidence for the brothers is by no means convincing. Illustrations, including photos of the 1910 events. ** * // HISTORY POPULAR Arctic Ireland. David Dickson. White Row Press, 135 Cumberland Road, Dundonald BT16 OBB. 93 pp Stg?4.95pb 1-870132-85-8. An excep tional cold snap in winter 1739-40 destroyed po tatoes, and was followed by drought, famine and disease that in ways equalled and even sur passed the horrors of the great famine a century later. From contemporary local and national re cords, Trinity senior lecturer Dickson graphically relates the two-year terror, with imaginative line illustrations by Geoffrey Fulton. One of the main differences between this and the later famine was that the 18th-century medical men were more ig norant. The population was much smaller, but the deathrate was in fact proportionally higher than in the 1840s. Source notes, index. * Atlas of Irish History, ed. Sean Duffy Gill &amp; Macmillan. 144 pp NPG pb 0-7171-2479-7. Six historians set out to recount and illustrate the his tory of the island, using where possible maps to show distribution or occasionally movement (Pa pal legates arriving in the 12th century appar ently by Great Circle routes on helicopter or Aingeal Lingus?). Method of presentation varies even within one map, as for instance one that shows population growth from 1821 to '41 in counties by percentage figures on coloured la bels, but in towns by histograms coloured ac cording to the year. Four pages later population decline in counties 1841-51 is showTn by histo grams to a different scale, and nothing for towns. A commonly used basic map is one with air brushed contours that perpetuates the error on about twelve pages that 500 metres is the same as 3280 feet. The mistake doesn't matter a damn, since nobody could distinguish the difference on the map, but it indicates a universal publishing truth: that while artists like typesetters make mis takes, their work is seldom proof-read as well. At one point Cashell and Clonmell gain letters to make them feel more comfortable to English car tographers, and the province of (Only?) Con necht emerges in the late 17th century, but imme diately disappears again. In such short and special scope, balance and proportion are hard to maintain, but it seems curious that wThile some canals that were then nonexistent or incomplete are shown in a 1783 map, railways seem to be unmentioned anywhere, and shown only in a Dublin street map of 1916. Compression is such that Parnell and J. E Kennedy appear on facing pages. The caption to the pictures on pages 100 and 101 is uniquely uninformative; it obliquely suggests that the masked men and their building are concerned with computers or financial serv ices, but we're unconvinced. In spite of such infe licities, there is much of interest and value here. * * Betsy Gray or Hearts of Down with other stories and pictures of '98. W. G. Lyttle.

Firstpub lished in 1827 (title verso says 1872) the author .ailed this collection of memoirs and anecdotes, mam' of them calculated to appeal to the equiva lent in those days of tabloid newspaper readers, a ' desultory melange, the whim of a winter's eve ning'. Inns, ladies who were perhaps no better than they should be, duelling, wits, intrigues, rcandals?this has a lot of the flavour of the social froth of the late eighteenth century but not too much of its seriousness we guess. It is not a fac &gt;imile, but has been well reset, and as a hand some big flapped paperback it looks pretty well worth the price. ** * A / The Sites of the 1798 Rising in Antrim and Down.

What a good idea for the bicentenary?a pilgrimage to the places from central Belfast to the remotest hills and graveyards where all the troubles of the North?and who knows other bits of Ireland? might have been circumvented if only, if only. Each entry gives the Ordnance Survey reference and notes on how to get there; some have pass able sketch maps; all have useful commentary on what happened to who and how and when and where. Index, too. ** / The Tellicherry Five : the transportation of Michael Dwyer and the Wicklow rebels. Kieran Sheedy Woodfield Press. 190 pp NPG pb 0-9528453-3-4. After 'the '98, Dwyer and his men held out in the Wicklow mountains for no less than five years, until Emmet's defeat forced their surrender. Strangely they were transported to Australia not as convicts but as free settlers (Tel licherry was the ship), but then they had the infa mous governor William Bligh to deal with. Just why RLE collaborated in publishing this (except that Sheedy once worked there) isn't clear, but the effect was that the title got free television ad vertising!

A second serving?after Irish Voices from the Great War (1996)?of personal memories collected by a journalist and broadcaster from interviews, dia ries and letters, to restore the public memory and fill the gap in history about the quarter-million irishmen?many of them nationalists?who fought in the 1914-18 war, many of whom died. The public appreciation of Ireland's part in that horrific, ultimately meaningless war is not the only thing changing. Dungan, having described the 'trials' and executions of many young men, some volunteers, for disobedience, cowardice or desertion (often due to intolerable stress) tells us that the British government may now be consid ering issuing 'pardons', just as they are now get ting slowly round to saying they don't feel en tirely happy about Bloody Sunday.

Peter J. Lu cas. UCD Press. 351 pp ?45 hb 1-900-621-05-3. We're hard to please, aren't we? How many times have we complained that some fascinating study that would interest a much wider readership than the publisher envisaged is in such dull and dreary dress as to repel rather than attract read ers? And now here writh a positively catchy title and a most attractive jacket is a highly technical and scholarly work?a synthesis perhaps, but by no stretch of terms a popularisation?of appeal to the very few academics with a special interest in the homogenising of written English during the fifteenth century and in how authors pro duced and 'published' their books on the eve of the printing revolution. Capgrave (1393-1464) w7as a prolific writer many of whose own auto graph manuscripts survive. Dr Lucas teaches Old and Middle English at UCD and has here brought together various of his papers on Cap grave produced over a quarter century. It wras an epoch in language development, when Latin and French wrere less and less used in the church, law7, business and even literature, and English had very recently lost a lot of its inflexions to become much more recognisably the language we use to day, though still undecided for instance whether to plump for northern kirk or southern cherch. But you have to pay for the delights Lucas has in store for you?laborious statements of the well known or obvious complete with footnoted sources no more reliable than himself. That he overlooks errors like confirmed for confined (p. 250) and were for where (p. 255) shows that five and a half centuries later scribes are still hurried and careless on occasion. * * * fa * Gaelic Nations: politics of the Gaelic lan guage in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the 20th century. Vincent McKee. Bluestack Press, 934 North Circular Road, London NW2 7JX. 137 pp StgflR?10fUS$15pb 1-902147-00-6. Feeling that the rather negative conclusions of Hindley's cold study Death of the Irish Language (1980) should and could be offset by the warm human story of the recent efforts of Gaeilgeoiri of Scotland and Northern Ireland to maintain or re establish their culture?not only linguistic?Dr McKee from county Down, a lecturer in politics in England, is perhaps just the man for the job in that he has the academic's and expatriate's bal anced approach, but is also an enthusiast and ac tivist in Gaelic causes. He cites sources for his sketch of the background history and of the 'bar ren years' 1920-65, and then a detailed studv of the 'mini-renaissance' including gaelscoileanna. There are some statistics provided, including a dubious 12,000 adult learners of Scots Gaelic in the USA in the nineties, and 600 in Australia, ver sus 1 in Hungary! There are some photographs.

Seven essays mostly by academics (of various disciplines) wrho are also activists, though one is an American social anthropologist. Of course the relationship between the language and politics and/or religion tends to be the cardinal point round which most of the material revolves, but these papers seem cool, measured and informed, and the book's pleasant and confident design helps emphasise that impression in contrast with Gaelic Nations (above) which is possibly no less balanced and authoritative but doesn't project that image. This is the first thing we've seen from the Ultach Trust, which is sponsored bv the Euro pean Regional Development Fund and other in ternational institutions, and we're impressed. Lexique etymologique de l'irlandais ancien de J. Vendryes : lettre D. P.-Y Lambert. Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies/CNRS Editions, Paris. 227 pp NPG pb 2-271-05415-X. Six fascicules covering words beginning A through C and M through U have already ap peared, two under the name of Vendryes himself who died in 1960 and four from E. Bachellery, who died in 1988, so this remarkable work is fur ther advanced than is suggested by the appear ance of 'D', and Pierre-Yves Lambert, who now has sole responsibility for it, reports that a new editing technique (he doesn't say electronic) al lows us to expect rather quicker publication of the remaining two fascicules. It is a dictionary historical as well as etymological, in that it re cords usages and their morphology both seman tic and phonetic from the first known examples of Early Irish (8th and 9th centuries) up to the beginnings of Modern Irish (17th century), as well as tracing their roots. Thus this?which is in French, not English?is a very specialised work of reference. * Slanguage : a dictionary of slang and collo quial English in Ireland. Bernard Share. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 345 pp ?10.99 pb 0-7171-2683-8. A very substantial and well-got-up dictionary? much more solid and authoritative than the title suggests?in which the soft lines between slang and colloquialism and dialect are not too strictly observed. It gives part of speech, source, original or literal meaning, slang meaning and example phrases from published or broadcast material (use in print or on air is the criterion for inclusion) with date?often quite recent?but not pronun ciation unless there is special need. Share is par ticularly strong on Irish (^Gaelic) words and phrases borrowed by Hiberno-English, and Ul ster dialect seems to be disproportionately repre sented, but these are random impressions. The chief one is that this has all the marks of a stand ard reference work, and a very long-needed and useful one which should be kept up to date (which academic institution in Ireland, other than the Royal Irish Academy, makes itself re sponsible for lexicography?). We guess that in a hundred years' time 'Share' will be a common name among students of Irish speech?is it in Share?

Muirithe is fed by constant enquiries from people who wonder if particular words are still in use and where they came from and what they meant. He pursues them tirelessly and with wit and erudition. Occa sionally as with 'Between the devil and the deep [blue] sea' we feel he too happily accepts some dubious derivation, but mostly his instinct is surely right, and it makes nice browsing.

It's a long time since there w7ere K as distinct from QC or SCs, and sure enough this book first appeared in 1918 under the famous Maunsel im print.

The first three of a series called Humanstep from this new publisher, these were first publish ed respectively in 1849,1890 and 1777. Emerson's piece, composed in 1837, was an address to 'Mr President and Gentleman' but we're not told on what occasion or who these people were. Hume's appears to be an autobiographical oration for his own funeral. All are set in Monotype Centaur type (one of the few typefaces whose italic has its own name?and a noble one, Arrighi) on a nar row page with rather overly generous head and tail margins.

Lilliput Press. 672 pp + 16 of photos. ?20pb 1-874675-89 9; hb ?40 -29-5. We are forced to use this rather outmoded category since it best expresses the subject. The book's subtitle indeed is quite mis leading. While botany, biology, zoology; geology etc. are sciences, the disciplines that are first sug gested by 'science' nowadays are physics, chem istry and those parts of biology that are a long way removed from the the world of the ento mologist, ornithologist and so on, and they have no place in this book. And culture! Well all these disciplines are of course part of human culture, but only a very distinct and special part. The most interesting tangent with culture here is the promised?but not much fulfilled?considera tion of the effects of traditional and ecclesiastical attitudes on nature study. The editor himself writes on Celtic and other traditional attitudes and one wishes more of the 27 contributors to this massive symposium had joined him and ana lysed their subjects to find the native influences. They stray occasionally into the disciplines them selves (and very interestingly) but their main purpose is the study of such studies: the history of these sciences. No need of apology: this is a useful and neglected subject in Ireland, and sur prisingly the Irish development of these disci plines, and their Irish focus both prove fruitful. In many respects this parallels and overlaps the re cent and magnificent Atlas of the Irish Rural Landscape. Whatever happened to astronomy? Maybe our clouded skies never gave that much chance. A fine big book on a big subject, with a single index. The illustrations are so few and so eclectic as to be a bit pointless. + * // (pb) NORTH Culture and Policy in Northern Ire land : anthropology in the public arena, ed. Hastings Connan and Graham McFarlane. Insti tute of Irish Studies. 154 pp Stg?9.95 pb 0-85389 690-9. Social anthropology is the discipline most in common among the thirteen contributors to this collection of papers which cover culture in public policy, agriculture and country people, Green Party policy, education policy (compared with Israel), the Irish language movement, equal opportunities in the clothing industry, unem ployment and parades. The word ethnography crops up pretty regularly There is also a paper on coping with early miscarriages, and we suppose it is some failure of categorisation in our head that makes it seem like odd man out. The lead paper, by the book's editors, is about modernity and postmodernity in the countryside, and seems to take two pages to remark that nobody is quite sure what postmodernity is. Language-led (as distinct from idea-led) disciplines have al ways terrified us since teachers started classes by chalking words on the blackboard and then spent 40 minutes explaining them. To us it is better practice after 40 minutes of delving into a subject to say: "And hey, we have a name for it?it's loga rithms/reformation/ablative-absolute (or what ever)". Chalking up words and then discovering they weren't much good in the first place is put ting the cart before the clothes-horse. And isn't there something wrong with our sense of per spective and proportion if one part of our past hogs the word 'modern'? Do we have to invent new words for today's and tomorrow's moder nity? Each paper trails its bibliography and there's a single index. ** * Democracy Denied. Desmond Wilson. Mercier. 189 pp ?8.99 pb 1-85635-177-7. Our first reaction was to wonder whether it was a good thing to publish this at a rime when everyone is straining to forgive or at least forget, and to admit there have been wrongs done on all sides. Much of what the famous anti-establishment priest writes is true, we fear, but that doesn't make it useful; at times he seems to veer into conspiracy theory which might be excusable in Ballymur phy, but even the blurb remarks that it "cries for rebuttal". Still, while Ian Paisley lives and rants, perhaps the diametrically opposite voice should be heard. Incidentally an Anglican minister (and Orangeman) calling the Catholic Archbishop a "red-hatted weasel" is made much of in two chapters. Whether it deserved one mention we still wonder. * * * A History of Northern Ireland 1920 1996. Thomas Hennessey. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 363 pp ?9.99pb 0-7171-2400-2 (hb?30-2623-4). Hen nessey is another of those much-published peo ple at the Politics department of Queen's, Belfast. Coffee breaks there must be devoted to compar ing royalties and barbed quotes from our (and other?) reviews. He has also worked at the Centre for the Study of Conflict at Coleraine. And sure enough this does seem to be a political-military history, which might seem a pity, since other things have been happening among those six counties and that million-odd great-hearted peo ple. The mean-hearted ones get the headlines: should they get the books too? In spite of the title, the book starts in 1912. Hennessey is no stylist. "Carson had defined the unionist duty, as citi zens, as to obey the law" should not have got into print, and though he can be crisp and trenchant he can also string out sentences in which the reader can forget how they started.

It was a toss up whether to put this under History, but the author proclaiming that it is based on the 'sound scientific principle that the simplest hypothesis that fits all the facts is usually the right one' con vinced us that this was probably the exception, always supposing that MacDowell knew all the racts in the first place. When we found Moya Llewellyn Davies spelt two different ways in one sentence in the blurb we looked her up in the index knowing (quite rightly) that we'd find a third variation; one of the family was under D, the others under L, incidentally.

Indeed he would have accepted an invitation to stay aboard for the Atlantic crossing if his Provincial had not cabled a veto, "Get off that ship," thus unknow ingly saving his life. Some of his photos were used in newspaper reports at the time, but here are almost all of them, including some technically bad ones that Brow^ne himself rejected?the only known photo of the Titanic's 'Marconi' wireless room was a double exposure he must have kicked himself about. There have been many books on the Titanic, but this is unique and takes one back to 1912 as no other could, with a wealth of fascinating detail and background material.

Playwright, actor and for many years em ployee of the Land Commission, Rutherford Mayne was nom de guerre of Sam Waddell (1878 1967), brother of Helen and by his marriage brother-in-law7 of the poet Joseph Campbell. A short but informative and well-illustrated intro duction by John Killen wTho edited the book out lines his career and his considerable role in devel oping the theatre in Ulster early this century. The text of three of his twelve plays is given: his sec ond, The Drone (1909) and his last two, Peter (1936) and Bridge Head (1939); the latter, perhaps his best, was inspired by his experiences in the Land Commission. This is invaluable as a rein statement of a nearly forgotten writer, as a contri bution to Irish and ?lster cultural and social his tory and as an entertaining period piece. * * -* POETRY Babylon Gaeilgeoir.

Michael Hamburger. Dedalus. 80 pp ?6.95 pb 1 901233-11-1. No. 2 in the Poetry Europe series, this provides the translator's selection of the work of an Austrian 'concrete' poet born 1925, who has himself translated poetry from English. The German originals are facing the translations by a poet in his own right, a year older than Jandl, who has also Englished Rilke and Celan, and who provides an introduction. The front cover painting goes unacknowledged. Is it by Van Gogh or are we ignorant louts? * &amp; // Entering the Mare. Katie Donovan. Bloo daxe. 80 pp Stg?6.95pb 1-85224-429-1. The blurb on the back cover almost amounts to poetry in its own right and rather frightening poetry to a mere man at that; actually we found the contents more interesting and less challenging, though sensitive male readers might be wise to avoid the title poem. It's her second collection and has a bril liant cover. -* A * / The Lost Fragments. James Laughlin. Dedalus. 24 pp ?4.95 pb ltd to 250 copies 1 901233-10-3. Laughlin (b. 1914), an American with Irish ancestry and an education from both Harvard and Ezra Pound (what a combination), founded the New Directions Press and published among others Dylan Thomas, and Vladimir Nabokov. His own Collected Poems were publish ed in 1994. The title of this collection is unex plained, the copyright date given is 1997 and no previous publication mentioned. ++ -* A * / Outside the Walls.

Work of two poets from respec tively Belfast and Newry O'Hare has appeared in The Honest Ulsterman and other periodicals, and won a Co-operation North prize. Sewell was translator of Cathal ? Searcaigh's recent Out in the Open. There's an appreciative introduction by Carol Rumens. ** A A Pennyworth of Rings. Mary Ramsay Neidpath Publishing, 8 Marine Drive, Portballin trae, Co Antrim, tel. 012657 31567. 51 pp Stg?3 brochure 0-9521128-1-7. Although mainly writ ten for children, these verses (which are old-fash ioned in the nicest sense) are offered specifically for our Poetry category so we obediently put them there, agreeing with the blurb that they ap peal to the child in all of us. Mary Ramsay is a retired teacher from Glasgow. John Brown's illus trations are nice too, and the cover gentle and appealing. ** A // The Secret Life of Images. Al Berto, transl. Richard Zimler. Mermaid Turbulence (see also Literature). 64 pp ?11 pb 1-901776-00-X. Originally (1991) in the poet's native Portuguese, this has been translated also into Spanish and French. The poet was born 1948 and died of can cer last June. These are poems about paintings? and some sculptures?by 26 artists from Giotto and Fra Angelico through Zurb?ran, Kandmsky and Chagall to Jose Pedro Croft?which are well reproduced in colour facing the text?indeed it should be noted how acceptably colour repro ductions can be printed on ordinary text paper these days. The queer thing is the artist is not always identified. Mermaid Turbulence sets high standards of book design. ** * A // Selected Works. John Keegan. Galmoy Press, Rath Oisin, Crosspatrick, Co Kilkenny (via Th?r ks), tel. 056-31347. 137 pp ?7.99 pb 0-9531583-0 6. Keegan (1816-49) was a contemporary of Man gan and a leading figure among the Nation writers. His work has been out of print for a cen tury, and here Tony Delaney introduces his selec tion of stories and poems, adding a series of Keegan's letters (hitherto unpublished) to the scholar-publisher John Daly, and some letters that were published in Dolman s Magazine in de fence of Irish priests. In notes Delaney, a native like Keegan of Shanahoe, provides a good deal of information about a writer largely forgotten who was and remained by choice through his short life, a'man of the people'. ** * A # / Thirst. David Wheatley. Gallery Press. 75 pp ?6.95 pb 1-85235-207-8; hb ?12.95 -208-6. The Gallery imprint is not given to discovering new writers under every stone, and the cynical might comment that you have to be rather an old young poet to get in there. Certainly you should be mas ter of your craft and so free to discover whether it constitutes an art as well, and Wheatley (born 1970) we judge qualifies easily on that criterion. He wron the Friends Provident poetry competi tion in '94, edits Metre and does reviews for us among others. We enjoyed a simple thing, 'Metro', about discovering Pans, which we dis covered when we were sixteen too. An under ground station called Goncourt! Maybe on the Luas you'll board at Wilde and, who knows, get off at Wheatley one day? ** A : " &gt;'/</page><page sequence="7">354 December 1997 BOOKSIRELAND POLITICS Nealon's Guide to the 28th D?il &amp; Seanad : election '97.

She writes about childhood traumas and how they can sabotage happiness quite un recognised for what they are. She explains how to go "from the head to the gut" to find what is there and then to allay it with forgiveness, acceptance and love. * * * / REFERENCE Irish Almanac &amp; Yearbook of facts 1998. ed. Pat McArt. ArtCam Publishing, Speenoge, Burt, Co Donegal, tel. 077-68186. 520 pp ?6.96/$14.95 pb 0-9529596-2-3. Very strongly recommended, this has become an institution in one year: the one-look book that you'd fly to first for up-to-date information about Ireland and as a handy annual archive. Having started with the 1997 edition at 300 pages for ?9.95 (which we reckoned good value) it has nearly doubled in size and amount of information given, cut its price by nearly a third and provided a badly needed index. There's even a colour section of the year's news in pictures. We cannot begin to list even the broad spheres of interest for which facts and figures are given. Some of the information for the past year (bestselling books for instance) is given only for January through September, though the main chronology of events starts more logically with October 1995. There are key note articles by key people on different spheres, and the one on arts and entertainment by Tony Clayton Lea deals with literature by mentioning Roddv's Booker and Seamus's Nobel (they were news two years and more ago) and remarking that he could list dozens of authors who are com mercially successful as well as 'integral to the fu ture development of their art'. In as many words, he could have actually mentioned a dozen, or out lined what had happened in the past year. Can you name one who isn't integral to the future, present or past of his art? The book gives incred ible value without looking overcrowded or poky, and D?nal Campbell (designer) deserves a bou quet of his own. + + -&gt; // RELIGION Jesus : the man and the message. Jack McArdle SSCC. Columba. 127 pp ?5.99 pb 1 85607-207-X. To paraphrase the blurb: "Christi anity is not about doing good; it is about a person. His message is so simple that the worldly-wise can easily rubbish it." The book attempts to high light that simplicity and to restate the core ele ments of the message. + * / More Stories for Reflection. Jack McArdle. Columba. 169 pp ?9.99 pb 1085607 202-9. Stories are the unfailing standby of the preacher, and not everyone has the ability to make one up, much less tell it effectively. Here are forty, with a thematic index, a veritable thesaurus of stories. +* A * / Nine Portraits. Peter Hannan SJ. Columba. 392 pp ?12.99 pb 1-85607-208-8. In the gospels, Jesus poses the question 'And you, who do you say that I am?' Here, the author examines what it means to be a Christian by considering nine dif ferent aspects of His personality. Drawing mainly on the gospels, Hannan also makes exten sive use of the divine ideas of the Enneagram as a cognitive framework, linking the reader's per sonal experience with the gospels. + * * % A River of Love: Frederic Ozanam and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. Michael Casey. Columba. 95 pp ?5pb25x 17 cm 1-85607-222-3. The "VdeP" is very much part of modern Ireland, where it became established during the Famine. For many it is the only channel for charitable community aid to the poor. Its chief founder was beatified this year, and this book is about him and the Society and particularly about poverty in Ire land and its remedies as well as its palliatives, and hence the new spirituality which belongs with them. The design is fresh and unusual, us ing vignetted (soft-edge) photographs with inte gral text, and some text in colour, which mostly works well. We can't understand why the book is so underpriced. Surely the Society, which is al ways looking for funds, could have used the dif ference? *+ ** -i-r* // SHORT STORIES Cuid na Trua. Se?n ? Siadhail. Coisceim. 143 pp ?4 pb.

Unscientific, bi assed, and using samples that would turn a stat istician grey overnight, radio journalist O'Gor man nevertheless tells us a good deal about our society in his Qneueingfor a Living programme, which also gave rise to a bestselling book by that title. Here's its sequel, introducing us to new age hippies, Irish welfare recipients in Britain and Belfast, women prisoners, rapists and other sex ual offenders, builders in Germany, prostitutes and drug addicts.

Interviews on what the Gaelic games mean to 28 people, some of them well-known players, but mostly politicians, jour nalists, broadcasters and such, including Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, President Mary McAleese and Archbishop Sean Brady. The GAA's strength in the face of the worldwide soc cer enthusiasm that has invaded Ireland too (yes and rugby) and of the crumbling of the image of an Ireland Catholic and Gaelic, is a marvellous thing, and maybe explains itself here. * Through the Green, Lightly. G. A. Finn. Golfinn Publications, 7Thornbem// Glountlmune, Cork, tel. 021-353464.198 pp ?6.99 pb 0-9531566 0-5. Thirty short stories about golf which after hesitation we categorise by subject-matter. The publisher's name will (correctly) tell you this is a self-publishing job, and it's a good one, with a main-chance cover photo, and no serious marks of amateurism. Aminor one is that first-time pub lishers often go for an unnecessarily expensive (and smooth) paper, and the result is a book no ticeably heavy for its size. Maybe no harm if it suggests good value for money?

Aquite big-format book with easy and inviting typo graphy and photos scattered among the text this is an engaging account by a Carmelite priest (b. 1932) who in his late forties suddenly threw up a fairly comfortable ministry in Ireland to be a mis sionary in the high and remote Andes among the very poor. It is a warm and happy book, about the author's genuine love for his new friends and their way of life, and full of tolerance and hu mour. It makes one think what a loss the 'imperi alism' of our missionaries will be. We think nowadays first of the dark side: of imposing alien beliefs, moralities (and worse) on simple people.
