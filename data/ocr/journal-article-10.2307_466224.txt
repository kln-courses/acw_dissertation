<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comparative Cosmopolitanism BRUCE ROBBINS In the recent, much-publicized backlash against the left's influence in the academy, which is hard to disengage from journalistic cheerleading for the Gulf War, there has been a strange coincidence. On the one hand, literature departments are accused by the right of abandoning "Culture" capital C in favor of multiculturalism, defined by The New York Times Magazine as "the drive to include non-Western materials in every possi- ble course."' On the other hand, in variants of a ubiquitous master-narra- tive of academicization-as-decline, literature departments are also accused of falling from the commonness of "Culture" into the privacy of professionalism - self-enclosed, jargon-ridden, hyper-theoretical, ignor- ing the common reader and lacking any general human concern. Aca- demics as a professional "conspiracy against the laity"; minority constituencies who insist on having their numbers and cultural differ- ences recognized in the curriculum, without concern for the value of their cultural exhibits as judged by some more general standard - in both cases the target is the same: the particular as opposed to the universal, the "special interest" pressing for its own advantage at the expense of the common good. There is some reason to be skeptical about any version of the common good that can ally against it two such unlike terms as "non-Western cultures" and "American professionals." But this is just the alliance I want to examine. My premise here will be that the Right is right: not in its opposition of the universal and the particular, about which more later, but in the (perhaps unconscious) implication that the unprecedented global reach of the Anglo-American humanities, our2 recent reaching out to diverse world written and oral traditions and to colonial, post-colonial, and minority discourse, is somehow related to the local self-interest, the social or institutional being of critics, scholars, and other cultural workers as a group. To this premise must be added, however, the question of whether relating local self-interest and global vision necessarily consti- tutes, as both right and left often assume, an accusation. I will answer that it is not. Cultural criticism in the United States has often claimed to be oppositional by virtue of its unworldliness - its joint appeal to a re- stricted, elevated canon and to Arnoldian or Weberian disinterestedness. Both appeals have been largely discredited in recent years. (Perhaps because it became increasingly difficult to believe, with the increasing 169</page><page sequence="2">170 Comparative Cosmopolitanism academicization of intellectual life, that institutions servicing so many thousands of people a year could be entirely staffed by, and engaged in producing, mavericks and outsiders.) But the brouhaha in the press over multiculturalism and the continuing vulnerability of "tenured radicals" to attack, not least from themselves, suggest that no alternative description of where intellectuals think they stand (especially when they are not being Eurocentrists) or what intellectual activities they engage in (especially when they are speaking about other cultures) has successfully taken the place of the former ideal. This essay is an attempt to sketch out such an alternative description. Now, perhaps, it is time to consider the new brand of intellectual oppositionality that might be emerging from what I call our new worldliness - worldliness in the two senses of 1) planetary expan- siveness of subject-matter, on the one hand, and 2) unembarrassed accep- tance of professional self-interest, on the other. The right is clearly wrong - indeed, it is contradicting itself-- when it suggests that multiculturalism and professionalism are related as parallel versions of particularism. Applied to these two objects, the charge of particularism indicates not a parallel but an intersection. For if profes- sional critics were hermetically sealed in an ivory tower, then why would they respond to "pressure" from "minorities"? If academics were as self-enclosed as we are told (and as some of us appear on occasion to believe), then why would they support multiculturalism? Between these two cases of supposed particularism, there would in fact seem to be some sort of communication, some common language, common interest, com- mon ground. But what ground could that be? When we speak today of "world literature" or "global culture," we are not naming an optional extension of the canon; we are speaking of a new framing of the whole which revalues both unfamiliar and long-accepted genres, produces new concepts and criteria of judgment, and affects even those critics who never "do" world literature or colonial discourse at all - affects all critics, that is, by shifting criticism's whole sense of intel- lectual enterprise. In an unprecedented and somewhat mysterious way, what it means to be an intellectual or a critic seems to have become worldly or transnational or - to use a wilfully provocative word - cos- mopolitan. But this worldliness or cosmopolitanism does not yet seem to have moved forward to the stage of conscious self-definition, self-legiti- mation, or self-defense. If the neo-conservatives have been quick to attack the emergent or perhaps already dominant sensibility which sup- ports multicultural inclusiveness, they have kept the term cosmopolitan- ism for themselves. Contrasting it to particularism or "cultural egocentricity," Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education, for example, cites it with full approval.3 The left meanwhile, groping for a line of defense stronger than "diversity for diversity's sake," has almost completely</page><page sequence="3">Bruce Robbins 171 shunned the term. And this is in large part, I think, because it connects international or global subject-matter with the embarrassingly local placement of intellectuals in relatively privileged institutions. Beyond the adjectival sense of "belonging to all parts of the world; not restricted to any one country or its inhabitants," the word cosmopolitan immediately evokes the image of a privileged person: someone who can claim to be a "citizen of the world" by virtue of independent means, high-tech tastes, and globe-trotting mobility. The association of cosmo- politan globality with privilege is so deeply unattractive to us, I think, because deep down we tend to agree with the right that, especially when employed as academics, intellectuals are a "special interest" group repre- senting nothing but themselves. Why else, I wonder, would we put our- selves through such extraordinarily ostentatious and unproductive self-torment over the issue of "representation," that is, the metropolitan right or privilege of "representing" non-metropolitan others? We have not thereby done anything to remedy the great historical injustices of colo- nialism and neo-colonialism. What we have done is helped to produce the great public relations disaster called "political correctness." And, as Ed- ward Said recently suggested, we have not done even the little we could do to correct the simple, brutal "ignorance" of Middle Eastern culture which permitted the personification of Iraq as Saddam Hussein and the destruction from the air whose casualties are still being counted. Rather than accepting the inescapability of "representation" and making the best use we can of its powers, we have preferred to take it as an unwarranted or questionable privilege, an occasion for repetitive self-questioning. This is not to say that the privileges associated with cosmopolitanism can be, as the saying goes, "left unexamined." The first entry under "cosmopolitan" in the Oxford English Dictionary, from John Stuart Mill's Political Economy, suggests one reason why left-wing critics have re- coiled from it: "Capital," Mill writes in 1848, "is becoming more and more cosmopolitan." Cosmopolitanism would seem to mimic capital in seizing for itself the privilege (to paraphrase Wall Street) of "knowing no boundaries." Which is also the gendered privilege of knowing no bodies: of being, in Donna Haraway's words, "a conquering gaze from nowhere," a gaze that claims "the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation."4 We may also remember that the gendered and classed privilege of mobile observation in a world of tight borders and limited visibility corresponds to a traditional self-image of criticism itself - criticism as disinterestedness, neutrality, objectivity - that the Left rightfully shies away from. The very act of comparison, as in "compara- tive literature," can seem to signal a liberation from insularity and na- tional prejudice into the one true judgment. And when the international range of comparison suddenly and dramatically expands to include the world outside Europe, there is the danger that, under cover of the most</page><page sequence="4">172 Comparative Cosmopolitanism democratic intentions, what will be re-invented is the old "free-floating intellectual" and/or an even older version of privileged impartiality. The most visibly ineligible example is perhaps V. S. Naipaul, who has recently been singing the praises of what he calls "our universal civilization."s5 Naipaul presents himself (in Rob Nixon's words) as "the ultimate literary apatride, the most comprehensively uprooted of twentieth-century writ- ers and most bereft of national traditions" (1). And he does so in order to lay claim to Arnoldian objectivity, to a "secure, reputable tradition of extratraditionalism" (11)- that is, to "detachment" in the geographical, empirical, and political senses of the word (3).6 As an image of criticism, "detachment" is deservedly obsolete. It is an article of our contemporary faith that, like Naipaul, intellectuals and academics are not "detached" but situated - situated, for instance, as metropolitans and/or as professionals. To say this, however, is already to feel some impious stirrings of doubt. What precisely do we mean by the "situatedness" we devoutly claim to believe in? What excess baggage does it carry? How tightly does it restrict access to the other places we may come from, the other places we communicate with? How far can this metaphor of locality be reconciled with the expansive awareness or worldliness that we also aspire to? In an effort to begin thinking through this piece of piety, let us con- sider, for example, Tim Brennan's application of the term "cosmopolitan" to Salman Rushdie. Brennan speaks of the "almost boastful cosmopolitan- ism" (134) of "third world metropolitan celebrities," including Rushdie, who are celebrated at the expense of "the domestic or indigenous artist in the process of an actual anticolonial struggle" (135).7 In another article, he places Rushdie in a group of "cosmopolitan commentators on the Third World, who offer an inside view of formerly submerged peoples for target reading publics in Europe and North America in novels that comply with metropolitan tastes" (63). The message of such cosmopolitans - a cri- tique of Third World nationalism and Third World elites - "is very famil- iar to us," Brennan concludes, "because it has been easier to embrace in our metropolitan circles than the explicit challenges of, say, the Salvadoran protest-author Manlio Argueta...." Thus the metropolis under- stands the Third World in terms of a "disengagement" and a "rootless- ness" that are "not at all characteristic of the 'counter-hegemonic aesthetics' of much Third World writing" (64).8 This argument can be classified as strongly reader- or reception-deter- mined. According to Brennan, the decisive, definitive reality behind Rushdie's writing, a social reality pinpointed with the authority of a lexicon borrowed from market research, is the "target reading publics" of Europe and North America: the "tastes" of the metropolitan consumer. Now the category of the "metropolitan" is clearly necessary here, as it is necessary to Rob Nixon's project of dispelling "the myth of Naipaul's</page><page sequence="5">Bruce Robbins 173 homelessness" (27). But simply to catch an author in the act of belonging to the metropolis, even one who claims to belong nowhere, is a two-finger exercise, given that we believe in advance that everyone belongs some- where, that there is no alternative to belonging. The exercise becomes complicated, unpredictable, and worth doing only when we ask what it means to belong, or how many different ways of belonging there may be. Absolute homelessness is indeed a myth, and so is cosmopolitanism in its strictly negative sense of "free[dom] from national limitations or attach- ments" - as in the doctrine, in George Boas's words, "that nationality is insignificant from every point of view."' But this negative sense of "cos- mopolitan" coexists from the outset in tension with more positive ones: with the scientific sense of "world-wide distribution," and with the more general sense of "belonging" to parts of the world other than one's nation. In any given case, it seems reasonable to try to sustain this tension, valuing the negative relation to nationality (which has its attractions these days, especially since the United Nations voted its support to U.S. war in the Gulf) without giving up an insistence on belonging - an insistence that includes the possibility of presence in other places, dispersed but real forms of membership, a density of overlapping allegiances rather than the abstract emptiness of non-allegiance. After all, we know in other contexts that "grounding," "placement," and "location" are tricky metaphors. Whether mediated by the Marxist global division of labor or the psychoanalytic model of selfhood, the notion that we are where we are not is an equal and opposite constituent of the new common sense. If our supposed distances are really localities, as we piously repeat, it is also true that there are distances within what we thought were merely localities. No localization can be assumed to deter- mine absolutely. If it could, then the charge of "metropolitanism" that falls on "celebrities" like Naipaul and Rushdie would also have to fall crushingly on the metropolitan critic who makes that charge, whatever his or her own political intentions and degree of celebrity.1" Situatedness would indeed be our "faith," in the most dogmatic sense, if we allowed it to suggest the surrogate divinity of a single, absolutely determining cause and if we did so, moreover, largely as a masochistic means of punishing and paralyzing ourselves. Not enough imagination has gone into the different modalities of situatedness-in-displacement. And one of the places where we must learn to see a more complex function or "office" of placement is the university. It says something about the humanities as institutionalized in the univer- sity, for example, that they can both over-appreciate the rootlessness of the world's Naipauls and, for reasons that are no less institutional, feed off what Brennan calls "protest-authors" as well. It says - and this is the beginning of an answer to the Right's charge that professional scholars esoterically ignore the general welfare - it says that critics have to</page><page sequence="6">174 Comparative Cosmopolitanism legitimate themselves to the public, that they do so as transmitters of cultural artifacts whose value to the public is a site of interpretive contest, as the size and limits of that public are also sites of contest, and that those who criticize Naipaul as a metropolitan are simply engaging in that contest, which is to say behaving in no less "professional" a manner, obeying no less "professional" a logic, than those who delight to see their prejudices confirmed by Naipaul's trashing of the postcolonial nations. The political differences that count are not differences about profession- alism as such." Professional self-legitimation can of course proceed by universalizing those values ("Western culture") of which the critic is custodian and transmitter. But professional self-legitimation can also base itself on the premise that all universals are merely particulars in disguise. The anti- cosmopolitan jargon of the authentically particular and the authentically local provides no escape from or political alternative to the realm of the professional. It simply conceals the exemplification, representation, and generalization in which any intellectual work, professional or not, is inescapably involved, its own included. Consider, for example, how the piety of the particular functions within the most basic and apparently neutral of scholarly concepts: that of specificity. In her seminal essay "Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholar- ship and Colonial Discourses," Chandra Talpade Mohanty objected that first-world feminist scholarship has often used the category "woman" in a universalizing way "with little regard for historical specificities" (340)."2 Her objection to "ethnocentric universalism" (336) in the name of specific situations was extremely useful then, and it remains indispens- able now." Nevertheless, it entitles one to inquire into the specific situa- tion in which it itself is formulated and received. What about the (presumably "western"?) logic which values and rewards this insistence on ("eastern"?) specificity? Why should the professional discourse of metropolitan critics greet the call for specificity with such suspiciously unanimous enthusiasm? One answer to these questions appears in Mohanty's counter-example of scholarship that is not "ethnocentric universalism," the example of a "careful, politically focussed local analysis" of lacemakers in Narsapur, India. This analysis leads to the conclusion, Mohanty says, that "There is no easy generalization in the direction of 'women' in India, or 'women in the third world'; nor is there a reduction of... the exploitation of the lacemakers to cultural explanations about the passivity or obedience that might characterize these women and their situation. ... These Narsapur women are not mere victims of the production process ...." I am in full sympathy with what I take to be Mohanty's intent here, but I am troubled by the possible consequences of her phrasing. If we agree that there is "no easy generalization," don't we want to retain the right to difficult gener-</page><page sequence="7">Bruce Robbins 175 alization? Critics other than Mohanty might easily conclude, otherwise, that generalization as such was politically undesirable. Whereas general- izing is precisely what Mohanty is doing. What she uncovers among the Narsapur women is not so much a set of particulars as an instance of a rather general rule: the rule that exploitation will always be met with resistance. As Mohanty herself notes, the finding of active agency among the Narsapur women registers nothing but that specific generalization which symmetrically opposes Orientalist generalizations about women's "passivity" and "obedience." "Specificity," in other words, functions here as an innocuous mask which hides not only a claim to epistemological authority, but also, more significantly, the unnecessarily camouflaged transmission of counter-universals, alternative generalizations.', I am trying to suggest three things. First, that the act of finding "agency" in text after text corresponds to a logic which is as much a part of our "professional" or "metropolitan" situatedness as the act of neglect- ing or denying it would be. Second, that a critic's transmission of the cultural value called "agency" should not disguise itself as a defense of the particular, the local, and the specific, since it involves generalizations that are no less dramatically synthetic - the people united will never be defeated, or the unconquerable human spirit - than the Orientalist ste- reotypes they are marshalled against. And third, that if we do not need "easy generalizations," we do need difficult ones - for example, the more difficult though less pious procedure of not assuming agency to be everywhere present, but trying to explain why it is where it is and why it isn't where it isn't. It is arguable that, as a critical procedure or paradigm, the formulaic recovery of inspirational agency may foster political quiescence, while a more politicized criticism might in fact result from a focus on vaster, less anthropomorphic, less hortatory structures. After all, why do we all value "agency" so highly? As an abstraction that lends itself equally well to the Marxism of Lukacs and the humanism of Matthew Arnold, agency legiti- mates the specific politics of neither one. What it does legitimate is the public representativeness of criticism as such, its responsiveness to the active voice or will of the people. When the academic humanist pulls this particular rabbit from his or her text, the point is both that the people make their own history and also, however implicitly, that the academic who is representing them as so doing, by transmitting this tidbit of the cultural heritage, is himself or herself acting in the interests of the people thereby, including the people who make that academic's own immediate history - the public legislators and private funders who pass judgment on academic legitimacy. However desirable agency may be, there is at any rate no inherent connection between it and the particular, the specific, the local."5 Here an edifyingly unliterary parallel presents itself: the so-called "localities"</page><page sequence="8">176 Comparative Cosmopolitanism debate which has raged over the past few years among radical geogra- phers. The move in geography to study the smaller, sub-regional units known as localities came at a time when the worldwide restructuring of the capitalist economy seemed at once to be increasing the scale of global interconnectedness and, in direct proportion, to be decreasing the power of the human agents concerned to grasp or resist its operations. In scaling down the size of the units studied, geographers were hoping to draw on the empirical authority of the particular, or rather were hoping through that authority to sustain a waning illusion of agency. Hidden away in the miniaturizing precision of "locality," with its associations of presence and uniqueness, empirical concreteness, complete experience, accessible sub- jectivity, has been the nostalgia for a collective subject-in-action that is no longer so easy to localize. As one essay in the debate concluded, "We do not have some privileged access to understanding patterns of human agency simply by studying localities" (187).16 Thinking small is not enough; agency is not to be had so predictably. The unit of coherence where transformative energies have the best chance of seizing hold is not predictable in advance; it might well be larger, not smaller. As Neil Smith writes: "it is not clear in the current restructuring that, in economic terms at least, coherent regions continue to exist as subdivisions of the national rather than international economy.,,17 This suggests the case for a certain cosmopolitanism - not one ob- sessed with embodying a preconceived totality, but one which does not judge in advance the macro-political scale of its units, which sees "world- ing" as a process, to quote Gayatri Spivak, and a process in which more than one "world" may be realized, where "worlds" may be contested.'" "Cosmos" (world) in "cosmopolitan" originally meant simply "order" or "adornment" - as in cosmetics - and was only later extended metaphor- ically to refer to "the world." Cosmetics preceeded totality. Worlding, then, might be seen as "making up" the face of the planet - something that can be done in diverse ways. At the same time, the case for this more modest cosmopolitanism is also a case for a certain professionalism - a professionalism which, without presumption of ultimate totalizing cer- tainty, believes in its own intellectual powers of generalization, abstrac- tion, synthesis, and representation at a distance, and in the process of putting them to use. Which believes, one might say, in its own work. Here, then, is a task: to drop the conversation-stopping, always-reversible charge of "privilege" and instead to discriminate degrees of complacency, degrees of service to the general welfare, within an overarching acknowl- edgement that the professional producers and transmitters of knowledge are of course not motivated solely (if at all) by pure disinterested altruism. This effort can begin where the cosmopolitan's privileges are most grossly accepted. In the new volume Global Culture, there is an essay</page><page sequence="9">Bruce Robbins 177 called "Cosmopolitans and Locals in World Culture," written by Ulf Hannerz, which defines the figure of the cosmopolitan by a series of exclusions. "Anybody who moves about in the world" (238), the author writes, is not a cosmopolitan." Nor is it sufficient to have "a willingness to engage with the Other" (239). Cosmopolitans are not tourists, for whom they are likely to be mistaken, since "tourists are not participants" (242). They are not exiles, since the exile's involvement with another culture has been "forced" (242). "Most ordinary labour migrants are not cosmopoli- tans either. For them going away may be, ideally, home plus higher income; often the involvement with another culture is not a fringe benefit but a necessary cost, to be kept as low as possible" (243). "The perspec- tive of the cosmopolitan must entail relationships to a plurality of cultures understood as distinct entities" (239). At this point, if not before, one becomes aware of how self-serving the process of definition is. Imagining cultures as "distinct entities" makes them into objects of artistic appreciation for the passing connoisseur; it is a way of imagining that all privileges of mobility and comparison inhere in the cosmopolitan observer. As the definition narrows further, it accu- mulates still more privileges. Cosmopolitans, like expatriates and ex-ex- patriates, "are people who have chosen to live abroad" (my italics). They know "that they can go home when it suits them." Today, this knowledge is less often guaranteed by independent means than by their occupa- tions. "Transnational cultures today tend to be more or less clearcut occupational cultures" (243). What occupations? The climactic example of transnational occupational culture is - to no one's surprise - the intellectuals. This more or less shameless use of the new "global culture" to re-in- vent or re-legitimate Mannheim's "free-floating" intellectuals seems to corroborate, once again, the fear that cosmopolitanism is only a tool of privilege and self-aggrandizement. But this is not the precise moral I draw from it. The essay's criteria for true cosmopolitanism share a good deal with traditional aesthetics: in its view, cosmopolitanism becomes an au- tonomous, unforced appreciation of coherence and novelty among distinct cultural entities. The editor of the volume in which this essay appears, Mike Featherstone, stresses the same point when he describes "transna- tional intellectuals" as those who "seek out and adopt a reflexive, metacultural or aesthetic stance to divergent cultural experiences" (9 - my italics). In my own view, it is this aestheticism, with its presumption of inequality and its spectatorial absence of commitment to change that inequality, which disqualifies the essay from representing the new trans- nationality of intellectual work. What we have to object to, in other words, is the particular position that the essay tries to legitimate, and not the effort of self-legitimation itself.</page><page sequence="10">178 Comparative Cosmopolitanism By producing a new, international pedigree for the old idea of the intellectual as autonomous critic, this essay joins the genre of the allegory of vocation. Allegories of vocation are critical works which, while doing whatever other interpretive tasks they set themselves, also perform a second, most often implicit function: they invent and arrange their con- cepts and characters so as to narrativize and argue for the general value and significance of the intellectual vocation they exemplify. Examples include Raymond Williams's Culture and Society, which tells the story of how leftist critics like Williams himself arose from Romanticism to write works like Culture and Society, or Gilbert and Gubar's The Madwoman in the Attic, which turns Jane Eyre into a paradigm for the rise of the twentieth-century feminist critic. (Or, for that matter, Gayatri Spivak's "Three Women's Texts and a Critique of Imperialism," which revises the Jane Eyre paradigm into an allegory of post-colonial criticism.) My point here is that I have not criticized any of these works by identifying the genre they belong to. If we accept the premise that we want to do significant work - that we want the privilege, if you like, of doing work that is more significant than merely earning a living - then we must desire and value texts which help explain, to ourselves and to others, why a particular sort of work is meaningful and valuable.We can criticize the aestheticism of this cosmopolitan, in other words, but not the fact that the essay makes a case for intellectuals. What should be set against it is another case for intellectuals that mobilizes cosmopolitanism differently. As an alternative within the same genre, then, I will take up in conclu- sion the rich and influential work of historian of anthropology James Clifford, work which has been so inspiring to students seeking a sense of intellectual vocation in the confusingly transnational space of contempo- rary knowledge, I think, in part because it has struggled with our ambiv- alence both about cosmopolitanism and about professionalism. Clifford's position on cosmopolitanism seems to be expressed unequivocally in his influential review of Edward Said's Orientalism. There the term "cosmo- politan" is unmistakably derogatory. "Said's basic values," Clifford says, "are cosmopolitan." This statement concludes Clifford's case that "hu- manist common denominators...are meaningless, since they bypass the local cultural codes that make personal experience articulate." "The priv- ilege of standing above cultural particularism, of aspiring to the univer- salist power that speaks for humanity...is a privilege invented by a totalizing Western liberalism" (263). What must always be avoided, Clif- ford declares, even if the concept of culture itself is eventually aban- doned, is "the positing of cosmopolitan essences" (274-75). In this context, "totalizing Western liberalism" seems to name what is wrong both with cosmopolitanism and with professionalism. Clifford's essay "On Ethnographic Self-Fashioning: Conrad and Malinowski," first published in 1985, has thus been taken as an undermining of the scientific</page><page sequence="11">Bruce Robbins 179 model of ethnographic authority that Malinowski did so much to make the professional standard, an undermining carried out in large part by invidi- ous juxtaposition with the messily literary, unsystematic, unprofessional figure of Conrad.2o "By professionalizing fieldwork," Clifford writes, "anthropology transformed a widespread predicament into a scientific method" (95). Conrad, who acknowledges the same (cosmopolitan) pre- dicament without escaping into scientific method, thus seems to embody the literary as an alternative to the professional. If this were all, it would be manifestly insufficient. For, as Paul Rabinow pointed out in his contribution to Writing Culture, it would leave Clifford no way of acknowledging the fact that, however "literary" his style, in relation to the anthropologists who are his subjects, he too is playing a professional role. "There is only one 'professional,' so to speak, in the crowd," Rabinow comments. "For, whereas all the others men- tioned are practicing anthropologists, James Clifford has created and occupied the role of ex officio scribe to our scribblings .... Clifford takes us as his natives" (242). A "new specialty is currently in the process of self-definition," Rabinow says (242). But Clifford's "own writing and situation," which define this specialty, "are left unexamined" (244).21 This sort of tit-for-tat, in which injurious epithets like "specialist," "professional," and "metropolitan" are asked to stand in for substantive political judgment, must always be the result as long as it is assumed that to go ahead and examine one's professional "writing and situation," to open one's eyes finally and painfully to the "situatedness" of a metropol- itan or a cosmopolitan, is ipso facto to judge oneself intolerably contam- inated and self-contradictory. One of the extraordinary strengths of Clifford's work is that this is an assumption he has come increasingly to question. If one looks more closely at the Conrad/Malinowski essay, one sees that in fact neither "professional" nor "cosmopolitan" functions there as a term of opprobrium. A struggle with "cosmopolitanism" (95), we are told, is something Conrad and Malinowski have in common. And the essay is about a "difficult accession to innovative professional expres- sion" (96 - my italics) that they also have in common. And that Clifford himself has in common with them as well. The last line of this extremely moving essay is an ambiguous quotation from Conrad's Marlow: "You see me, whom you know." The point of the ambiguity seems clear: the essay can itself be read as an allegory of vocation describing a "difficult accession to innovative professional ex- pression" shared not only by Conrad and Malinowski, but by Clifford too, along with many of his readers. One might think of the essay, then, as just that act of professional self-examination that Rabinow found lacking in Writing Culture. Much of its power comes from the extra work it does to redescribe and legitimate the work of the historian of anthropology along</page><page sequence="12">180 Comparative Cosmopolitanism with that of the anthropologist, the professional, second-order work of criticism as well as the "primary," "unprofessional" work of the novelist. In Clifford's allegorical reading of Conrad, "Heart of Darkness" be- comes an alternative model of writing that is no less professional than Malinowski's professional ethnography. The decisive difference between them is that Conrad includes the experience of fashioning and self-fash- ioning, the activity of selecting and discarding, that goes into any ethno- graphic writing. His fiction includes the exclusions - the Lie to the Intended, the tearing off of Kurtz's "Exterminate the brutes!" from the official report - exclusions that are inevitable in all professional dis- course. Professional discourse, the moral would seem to go, cannot be purified; it can only be saved by its ironic self-consciousness of its impurity. We may or may not feel that this solution "works" - that it rises above, say, irony as a mode or style of living with exclusion too comfort- ably. But in fact this is only one of two resolutions to the dilemma of professional exclusiveness that the essay explores. After all, why is ex- clusion inevitable? On the one hand, Clifford suggests that, like fiction, even the most scientific discourse selects and fashions and invents. Here only self-consciousness will help. On the other hand, however, he also suggests that the Lie to the Intended and the tearing off of "Exterminate the brutes!" are exclusions produced not by representation in general, but more precisely by the writer's or professional's deliberate act of loyalty to the arbitrary limits of his chosen culture. Marlow, Clifford says, "learns to lie - that is, to communicate within the collective partial fictions of cultural life" (99). Clifford tries to restrict the damage this will do as a paradigm of professional ethnography: the "ethnographic standpoint" is better represented, he adds, not by Marlow but by the second narrator, silently listening to him, who "salvages, compares, and (ironically) be- lieves these staged truths." But this distinguishing of narrators does not seriously affect the result: professional writing seen as "local, partial knowledge," or more strongly (but relegated to a footnote), as "a positive choice for the 'lie of culture"' (99). "[L]ike Marlow's account aboard the Nellie, the truths of cultural descriptions are meaningful to specific inter- pretive communities in limiting historical circumstances" (112). The ar- bitrary, exclusive cultural wholeness that Malinowski imposes upon the Trobriands results from an arbitrary, even absurd act of self-defining allegiance to the professional community of English anthropologists. The ethnographer lies about his cultural objects, presenting them as more "local" than they are, in order to make himself a member of the "local" culture of his fellow professionals. This is a dead end of professional self-definition from which ironic self-consciousness offers no hope of rescue. But Clifford does find a way out of it. The logic of self-rescue goes from "culture" to the "post-cul-</page><page sequence="13">Bruce Robbins 181 tural" and finally back to the "cosmopolitan." If it is no longer feasible to think of the cultures studied by ethnography as distinct entities, as Clif- ford repeatedly suggests, then why assume that the professional culture of ethnographers is a distinct entity? If we must learn to see other cultures not as distinct, different wholes, but as mobile, fluid, hybrid, and inclu- sive, then why insist on a necessary and absolute exclusiveness in study- ing the culture that studies those cultures? In writing himself out of "culture" as an absurd but necessary (and necessarily exclusive) order, Clifford also writes himself out of "the profession" as a similarly neces- sary (and exclusive) absurdity. Instead of a dichotomy of professional describers of culture, on the one hand, and their non-professional objects of description, on the other, Clifford now assumes a "post-cultural" space where the subjects and objects of description are at least potentially reversible, where the mobility required for observation and comparison is not monopolized by one side, where the word "local" has lost much of its contrastive force. His name for this space - a space that is not exclu- sively professional - is "cosmopolitanism." In the work that has followed The Predicament of Culture, Clifford has radically revised his opinion of cosmopolitanism.22 Rather than speaking in the name of the local, as in the review of Orientalism, he has been pointing out the manifold abuses of "thinking local," the distortions involved in taking "the field" and "the village" as localizations of culture. He has been calling on anthropologists to bring back into their ethnographies the "cosmopolitan intermediaries" who intervene in and help constitute them, and "to focus on hybrid, cosmopolitan experiences as much as on rooted, native ones." Clifford can approve of cosmopoli- tanism because he has been seeing it, and teaching others to see it, as neither the consequence nor the prerogative of "totalizing Western liber- alism"; he has been seeing it as something he himself shares with his subjects. It is not only gentlemen travellers, but the people of color who were the servants of those travellers, who have "specific cosmopolitan viewpoints." Even the organized coercion of migrant labor produces "cosmopolitan workers." "The notion that certain classes of people are cosmopolitan (travellers) while the rest are local (natives)" is only "the ideology of one (very powerful) travelling culture." Questions of power aside, "they" and "we" can no longer be divided as "local" and "cosmo- politan." Thus the latter term becomes available again for general use. Instead of renouncing cosmopolitanism as a false universal, one can embrace it as an impulse to knowledge that is shared with others, a striving to transcend partiality that is itself partial, but no more so than the similar cognitive strivings of many diverse peoples. The world's particulars can now be recoded, in part at least, as the world's "discrepant cosmopolitanisms."</page><page sequence="14">182 Comparative Cosmopolitanism A final few words about how comparative attention to "discrepant cosmo- politanisms" can and cannot help us respond to the current backlash. In a article in The New Yorker which does its bit for this backlash, Cynthia Ozick comes to her conclusion on multiculturalism: "I would not wish to drop Homer or Jane Austen or Kafka to make room for an Aleutian Islander of lesser gifts, unrepresented though her group may be on the college reading list."23 I take Clifford's reversal on cosmopolitanism as a hint that one of the various moves we might make against this use of the Aleutian Islander as an empty figure for pure particularity, and against the label of cultural particularism in general, is to fill the figure in, not just as a particular (worthy of the same respect as every other particular), but also, perhaps, as the carrier and embodiment of a certain cosmopolitan- ism. One might for example bring forward an essay by Claude Levi- Strauss on the "cosmopolitanism" of native Americans along the Pacific Northwest coast. Apropos of the putative Westernness of the Great Ideas, one might emphasize the word "Egypt" on the first page - unfortunately, only on the first page - of an article called "The Greek Origins of the Idea of Cosmopolitanism," which reads as follows: "The earliest recorded formulation of this idea is supplied by modern archaeological discovery at Tell el-Amarna, in Egypt. Inscriptions have been found there, written by Akhnaton (pharoah of Egypt from 1375 to 1358 BC) .... ,24 Or one might counter ethnocentrisms both right and left with cosmopolitanism like that of the last page of I, Rigoberta Menchu: "[M]y commitment to our struggle knows no boundaries nor limits. That's why I've travelled to many places .*...,25 The scholarly project of accumulating instances of cosmopolitanism from around the globe could help us make the point that the concept is neither a Western invention nor a Western privilege. When the Right suggests that after all, there is ethnocentrism everywhere, that is, in the Third World too, the inevitable prelude to the suggestion that, after all, only in "the West" has there been any move away from it, we can then say not just that unequal power has made Eurocentrism qualitatively different in its effects from other ethnocentrisms. We can also say that we value the move away from ethnocentrism - in all the many places, Western and non-Western, where it has occurred. To take an empirical route out of the over-simple binary of universal and particular, rather than performing a merely logical or deconstructive exercise on it, would put the matter across to a broader audience, and it would also have the advantage of distinguishing cosmopolitanism from an abstract, ahistorical universal- ism. For it would bring out many diverse and overlapping syncretisms and secularisms26 for which the term is an umbrella. (The opposition between religion and secularism itself might be one casualty of such a project.)</page><page sequence="15">Bruce Robbins 183 The limits of the term "cosmopolitanism" are also its conjunctural virtues. No one actually is or ever can be a cosmopolitan in the full sense of belonging everywhere. If such a thing were conceivable, it would not be desirable, for as Donna Haraway has pointed out, it could only exist in the form of complete cultural relativism.27 The interest of the term cosmo- politanism is located, then, not in its full theoretical extension, where it becomes a paranoid fantasy of ubiquity and omniscience, but rather (par- adoxically) in its local applications, where the unrealizable ideal pro- duces normative pressure against such alternatives as, say, the fashionable "hybridization." Its provocative association with privilege is perhaps better understood, in this context, as the normative edge that cosmopolitanism tries to add to the inclusiveness and diversity of multi- culturalism - as an attempt to name a necessary but difficult normative- ness.The term is not as philosophically ambitious as the word "universalism," though it does some of the same work. (It makes room for moments of generalizing, one might say, without offering license for uninhibited universalizing.) Nor is it as politically ambitious as the word "internationalism." But it does start us asking what form such an interna- tionalism might best take. The academy-bashing journalists have been suggesting that multiculturalism is nothing but an attempt to revive the naive Third Worldism of the 1960s, with its automatic division between Imperialist Bad Guys and Newly Independent Good Guys. It seems to me that the term cosmopolitanism better describes the sensibility of our moment. Now, as opposed perhaps to two or three decades ago, anti-im- perialism has been and must be newly careful, skeptical, measured in its support of any nation. Recently and paradigmatically, it has had to learn to oppose Bush's war without defending Saddam Hussein. More gener- ally, it has been to school with movements in the name of gender, class, and sexual orientation which, in Jean Franco's words, "have sprung up on the margins of the nation state" and "no longer couch cultural or political projects in national terms" (205).28 Our moment, one might say, is that of the globalizing of such movements - a moment to which there would correspond, ideally, some new, de-nationalized internationalism. If cosmopolitanism cannot deliver an explicitly and directly political program, it is at least a step toward this sort of internationalist political education. By suggesting that there is no uniquely correct place to stand, it can take some of the moralism out of our politics. Better still, by doing so it can liberate us to pursue a long-term process of trans-local connect- ing that is both political and educational at once. And in the midst of the short-term politico-educational crisis where we now find ourselves, it can designate a teaching of culture capable of mobilizing the energy and enthusiasm of a broad front of people who are not all or even predomi- nantly leftists, whatever the right may think. As a practice of comparison, a range of tolerances and secularisms, an international competence or</page><page sequence="16">184 Comparative Cosmopolitanism mode of citizenship that is the monopoly of no one class or civilization, it answers the charges of "particularism" and "loss of standards," insist- ing confidently that multiculturalism is a common program, a critical program, a positive ideal of interconnected knowledge and pedagogy, that elevates rather than lowers existing educational standards.29 If you doubt its power, listen to Sylvia Wynter's critique of California's new, insuffi- ciently multicultural history texts. Wynter calls for a new framework which "seeks to go beyond the model of a nation-state coterminus only with Euro-immigrant America, to one coterminus as a 'world' civiliza- tion, with all its peoples; and therefore, for the first time in recorded history, coterminus (as a land that's not been yet but must be) with humankind."30 The word "cosmopolitan" comes from the Greek for "citizen of the world." In an international context, the model of citizenship is extremely problematic. In the absence of a world state - which at present seems unimaginable, or imaginable only as nightmare - the cosmopolitan can- not be to the globe as the citizen is to the nation, and to suggest the contrary is to create dangerous illusions of global equality, responsibility, and voter-like control. To associate a citizen's rights and obligations with a cosmopolitan's knowledge is also to risk a new slide toward elitism. I'm moved to put it forward anyway, or at least to use it in pointing toward a site that some other term may fill better, largely because of the Gulf War, because of the failure of internationalism that the Gulf War illustrated, and because of my sense that the central task for intellectuals in this particular corner of North America is to do something about the desperate pretensions of this failing, flailing nation to act as world policeman. It seems to me that the knowledge that might have helped stop this war, and that might help stop American citizens from making or approving other wars like it, has a strong claim to be considered, in our own day, "the best that is known and thought." At any rate, to preserve and transmit such knowledge, trying to educate future citizens of the world rather than future world policemen, seems to me a task worthy of any humanist's intellectual curiosity and sympathetic imagination.

As the word "our" suggests, I am primarily interested here in addressing people who, like myself, earn an uneasy living from cultural work in professions and institutions that sometimes seem aimed against the political and ethical principles which give that work such meaning as it has. Those who work elsewhere, or who escape such contradictions between work and politics by sustaining their radicalism without the help of tenure, will I hope pardon what may look like the self-indulgent narcissism of this exercise. Others will hopefully excuse what they may see as my evasion of personal detail.</page><page sequence="17">Bruce Robbins 185 3.

It seems possible that the vocabulary of "celebrity" functions in cases like this to tarnish a given writer obliquely, that is, to do so without invoking the vocabulary of class, which is more seriously contaminating, on the one hand, but also too visibly contaminating for one's allies as well as one's enemies, hence often unusable. 11.
