<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bilolgy Today Telling About the Lure of Science Maura C. Flannery Department Editor Two Nobel Prize winners have given me much food for thought re- cently. It is not only their research, but their descriptions of why they do re- search that I find interesting. They have both written beautiful pieces about what attracts them to their work, about why they do science. Ar- thur Komberg (1989), a Nobel laureate in physiology and medicine, has done this in his scientific memoir, For the Love of Enzymes, and the Nobelist in chemistry Ronald Hoffmann in a series of articles on molecular beauty. They have both fulfilled what Hoff- mann sees as an essential obligation of scientists We have to tell people (not the least among them being our parents and spouses) what it is that lures us back to work nights and Sundays, why it's thrilling to open a new issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Molecular Beauty Hoffmann's quote is from a 1987 ar- ticle; it seems to have haunted him and precipitated the 1988-1989 series of pieces on "Molecular Beauty." In the first of these (1988a), he describes the conversation that prompted him to write them. It happened while Hoffmann was working on a manu- script during a plane trip with his wife. When she asked what the manu- script was about, he replied, "A beau- tiful molecule." She then wanted to know, "What is it that makes some molecules beautiful to you?" To an- swer her, Hoffmann decided to prac- tice what he had preached in 1987, to explain the "lure" of this and other molecules. He refused to accept the idea that only chemists can appreciate the beauty of chemistry, that "out- siders are excluded." The substance which spurred this work is an inorganic compound, NaNb3O6. Hoffmann admits its beauty might not be readily apparent, then patiently describes the crystal's layered structure, the entrapment of niobium (Nb) atoms in octahedra of oxygen atoms and the interplay of symmetry and asymmetry which gives this compound its appeal. Like an art critic analyzing a painting, he moves step by step, de- scribing each facet of this compound's rather complex structure. His writing is patient; he doesn't try to hurry the reader along. Hoffmann really is ex- plaining this molecule to his wife or to anyone unfamiliar with chemical bonds and three-dimensional chem- ical structures. He ends, as any good critic would, by coming back to the whole picture and explaining that this molecule's beauty is in its structure, which is at once symmetrical and unsymmetrical. The beauty is in the incredible inter- play of dimensionality. Think of it: two-dimensional slabs are assembled from infinite one-dimensional chains of edge-sharing octahedra around nio- biums, which in turn share vertices. These two-dimensional slabs interlink to the full three-dimensional structure by bonding with one-dimensional needles of niobium and sodium. Hoffmann uses such careful anal- ysis in each of his articles. In the second (1988b), he discusses a mole- cule that seems to be "plain." He refuses to call it "ugly." Describing himself as a "most prejudiced chemist," he claims that "there are no ugly molecules." The molecule in question is an intermediate in the syn- thesis of a catenane, two interlocking rings of carbon atoms in which the rings are not chemically combined, but are held together like the links of a chain. Here the beauty is not the "static" kind of NaNb3O6, but that of dynamism, movement, change. Making such a molecule is difficult and its "beautifully conceived syn- thesis" requires several steps. Though the entire synthesis is "ele- gant," Hoffmann sees the molecule in the middle of the scheme-the one he cites at the beginning of the article- as most beautiful because it is most complicated relative to the starting materials and the goal, the molecule "most disguised, yet the one bearing in it, obvious to its conceiver but to few others, the surprise, the essence of what is to come." Beautiful "Pasta" The excitement Hoffmann feels for chemical synthesis comes through clearly here. He is indeed describing what lures him to the lab, why he can't wait to read the latest chemical journals. In his third article (1989a), he con- tinues to share with the unanointed his fascination with chemistry. This time his subject, at first glance, "looks like a clump of pasta congealed from primordial soup." This rather unap- pealing description turns out to be about hemoglobin! Hoffmann finds its attraction in its "richness," its intri- cacy, and in the fact that its "bizarre sculpted folding has a purpose: it allows for the reversible binding of ox- ygen." In the process, as oxygen binds to the iron at the center of the Maura C. Flannery is associate pro- fessor of biology at St. John's Uni- versity, Jamaica, NY 11439.

This care- fully orchestrated dynamism is "daz- zling," and stems from the "enabling complexity ... of every bend, fold, or twist." June Goodfield has said that science is like modern music or art: its beauty is not ob- vious; a perceptive critic is needed to guide one to under- standing and hence to appre- ciation. Hoffmann thus makes clear to a nonscientist why this "pasta" of a molecule is beautiful. But his descrip- tion sheds new light on even a biolo- gist familiar with hemoglobin. One's appreciation is deepened as it is for a familiar art masterpiece when ana- lyzed by a perceptive critic. By the time Hoffmann's fourth ar- ticle (1989b) appeared, I was ready for his series to go on indefinitely. After all, there are more than 7 million known chemicals, so he couldn't pos- sibly run out of material. And in this installment, he tackles a totally dif- ferent class of molecules: metal car- bonyl clusters. In these molecules, carbon, which "always" forms four bonds, instead forms six. Here, the at- traction is novelty, surprise, even shock-the full impact of which should hit every maker of carbon com- pounds. It makes these carbonyl clusters . . . beautiful. They are new, interesting, and lovely. The appeal comes from the fact that scientists "are addicted to new knowl- edge." The Aesthetic of Chemistry Just when Hoffmann has whetted the appetite for still more molecular beauty, he writes, "Perhaps it's time to stop here and take a different tack." He ends by summarizing his aesthetic of chemistry and comparing it with philosophers' descriptions of the aes- thetic of art. He agrees with Monroe Beardsley (1981) that intensity is an aesthetic quality. Some molecules seem to possess a large number of in- teresting attributes, and this makes them especially attractive. He gives as an example an organometallic mole- cule in which one and the same tungsten atom forms a singie tuingsten-carbon bond, a double one, and a iiple one. And two bonds to phosphorus, to. good measure. Hoffmann also agrees with the aes- thetic philosophy of Nelson Goodman (1968), who sees both science and art as cognitive processes. Hoffmann notes that we feel that these molecules are beau- tiful, that they express essences. We feel it emotionally, let no one doubt that. But the main predisposition that allows the emotion-here psycholog- ical satisfaction-to act is one of knowing, of seeing relationships. What Hoffmann has done is to let the nonchemist in on this knowledge, to point out relationships between symmetry and asymmetry, between structure and function, between old ideas and new ones. He has done this patiently, giving sufficient back- ground explanations so we know enough to appreciate the beauty. June Goodfield (1981) has said that science is like modern music or art: its beauty is not obvious; a perceptive critic is needed to guide one to understanding and hence to appreciation. Hoffmann is one such guide, and he provides more than a lesson in the beauty of chemistry. His is also a lesson in good teaching. He makes his points clearly, using many illustrations. He guides the reader through unfamiliar terri- tory by starting with basics and care- fully introducing all the necessary points in his argument. Teachers can learn much from his approach. He has the patience most of us lack, he seems to always remember his purpose-to reveal the beauty in his subject-and does nothing to make the reader bridle and give up because the expla- nation becomes too complex or the ar- gument too turgid. It might seem odd that in a journal devoted to biology teaching, I've spent so much time discussing the writings of a chemist. But I've done so for two reasons. First, Hoffmann's ex- planations of molecular beauty are rel- evant to biology teachers because most introductory biology texts begin with a discussion of the molecular basis of life. If we could incorporate his approach into our lessons, we might make this topic, one of the most difficult, more interesting to students. It might also give them a better under- standing of molecular dynamics and of the importance of the molecular level to the higher levels of biological organization. Loving Enzymes The other reason for discussing Hoffmann is that I love molecules! I am a biochemist at heart. While the intricacies of ecosystems fascinate me and the adaptations of organisms as- tound me, it is with the molecular level of biological organization that I feel most comfortable. Among mole- cules, my favorites are the enzymes, and that's why the work of the other Nobelist I mentioned, Arthur Korn- berg, interests me so much. Kornberg has spent most of his sci- entific career studying enzymes- more than 30 of them-and while Hoffmann considers no molecule "ugly," Kornberg claims he has never met a dull enzyme. From the humble hydrolase that uses a molecule of water to split NAD to the glamorous polymerase that assembles vast DNA chains of genes and chromosomes, the feats of enzymes are all awesome. A statement like this would definitely predispose me to like his memoirs, For the Love of Enzymes, but, in fact, I bought the book solely on the basis of its title-it had to be good! But even less prejudiced readers than myself have found the book fas- cinating (Racker 1989). Why this is the case is not readily apparent. Kornberg simply seems to be describing his re- search, telling about the twists and turns it took over the years from his early work on vitamins to his present interest in viral replication systems. He does not reveal much personal background in the process. He wants to tell the story of his science rather than that of his life I wished to use the chronology of my career only to organize the narrative and introduce personal elements where they might leaven and hu- manize the science. And they do just that. They are what make this book so rewarding. They make it the most personal of books because through them, Korn- berg reveals why he loves his work. He does what many scientists are loathe to do, he tells what attracts him as a human being, as well as a scien- tist, to the study of science and to the study of enzymes in particular. Early in the book he says that, after several years of work in nutrition, he found enzymology "intoxicating," because "the momentum of experimental work was breathtaking." Instead of waiting days or weeks for the results of dietary assays, enzyme assays could be completed in minutes, so "many ideas could be tested and dis- 56 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 52, NO. 1, JANUARY 1990</page><page sequence="3">carded in the course of a day." Korn- berg is a man in a hurry. He even admits to being impatient. When a re- search assistant broke a tube of sample, he said it didn't matter be- cause he had more; Kornberg replied that "the hour lost can never be recov- ered." The Rewards of Enzymology But it isn't just the pace of enzyme research that attracts Kornberg; he says that punfying an enzyme is rewarding all the way, from first starting to free it from the mob of proteins in a broken cell to having it finally in splendid iso- lation. Enzymes have a level of complexity that "suits" him. He feels "ill at ease grappling with the operations of a cell, let alone those of a multicellular crea- ture." He also feels "inadequate" in studying the chemistry of small mole- cules. For him, "becoming familiar with the personality of an enzyme performing in a major synthetic pathway is just right." His language is very revealing. Komberg thinks of enzymes as having "personality"; to study one, he must separate it from the "mob" of proteins in the cell. He describes one of the en- zymes he discovered as being more "novel and glamorous" than another. As far as enzymes are concerned, he admits to feeling "like a parent con- cerned for a child's whereabouts and safety." He can't leave the lab at night without knowing in what state of pu- rification the enzyme has been left. This anthropomorphic language re- veals Kornberg's level of intimacy with his objects of study. In a sense, they have become part of him. This is not an uncommon experience for a sci- entist, or indeed for those who enjoy their work and the things they work with. What makes Kornberg unusual is how articulate he is about his feelings. He does precisely what Hoff- mann prescribes: he tells us what lures him back to the lab at night. It is very refreshing to read a scientific memoir with statements like "Holy Toledo! This fraction had the bulk of the enzyme activity," or "Wow! The reaction was explosive, hundreds of times greater than before. The radio- activity counter went wild-one of those rare moments in a scientific life- time." These are very simple, direct statements, yet they clearly convey that science can be a great source of Joy. Hunters in Medical Science But this volume is more than a com- pilation of personal comments. These are, as Kornberg promises, the "leaven" for the science which fills the book. He not only describes his re- search, particularly the work with DNA polymerase which won him the Nobel Prize, but also historical back- ground which puts his work in per- spective. Kornberg sees 20th-century medical science as a series of hunting expeditions. He takes his cue from Paul de Kruif's classic history of bacte- riology, The Microbe Hunters. These re- searchers dominated the field in the first two decades of the century and were followed by the "vitamin hunters." In the 1950s, it was the "en- zyme hunters" who were at the fore, and they have been superceded more recently by the "gene hunters." Though Kornberg would, of course, identify himself as an enzyme hunter, he could be considered a member of all these groups. His first research was on vitamins, particularly folic acid. It was the role of many vitamins as coenzymes which led him to enzy- mology. He studied the synthesis of NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinu- cleotide phosphate), which contains the vitamin niacin as well as most of an ATP molecule. His work with ATP led him to the study of nucleotide syn- thesis. Since others were pursuing purine-adenine and guanine-syn- thesis, he investigated pyrimidine- uracil, cytosine and thymine-pro- duction. Though he originally used liver, kidney and potato extracts, he eventually discovered the advantages of working with microorganisms. He could even be called a microbe hunter, because he searched for and found soil bacteria that thrive on pyrimidines and could be used in the study of py- rimidine biochemistry. In a beautiful example of how re- search interests develop and evolve, Kornberg's work on nucleotide syn- thesis led quite naturally to studies on how nucleotides are joined to form nucleic acid. Again, the work of others determined the direction of his re- search. Severo Ochoa and his col- leagues had just discovered the en- zyme responsible for RNA synthesis, so Kornberg hunt7d for a similar en- zyme in DNA production. The result was DNA polymerase. In 1959, he and Ochoa jointly received the Nobel Prize for their work, but this milestone did not end Kornberg's work on DNA synthesis. He later discovered that his polymerase was more an enzyme of repair than synthesis, and it was his son, Tom, who as a fledgling bio- chemistry student discovered two of the major DNA polymerases. Kornberg's later research has been in identifying and explaining the workings of the many enzymes in- volved in DNA synthesis. The DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is a com- plex of 10 proteins, each with a spe- cific function. The alpha unit is the ac- tual polymerase, the tau unit clamps the polymerase to the template, the epsilon unit has a proofreading func- tion-deleting an improperly paired nucleotide-and other units improve the efficiency of these primary activi- ties. Besides this elaborate poly- merase, there is also a helicase to un- wind the DNA and a topoisomerase to do the untwisting required for the un- winding. Kornberg sees these and a number of other enzymes as joining to form a replisome, a structure-an elaborate factory-which combines all the functions. Gene &amp; Enzyme Hunting Both because of its size and the disruptive forces needed to open a cell, Kornberg has yet to take the rep- lisome "alive," but his research so far points to the plausibility of its exis- tence. In pursuing this work, Korn- berg has become something of a gene hunter. He identified a 245 base-pair DNA sequence that is the origin for chromosome replication in E. coli, and then cloned this sequence in a plasmid. Analysis of this sequence shows it is remarkably conserved in widely-divergent bacterial species and that specific sequences have particular functions in initiating replication. This work with gene sequences is almost inevitable today for anyone working with proteins, particularly with pro- teins that bind to DNA. But Kornberg has not been con- verted from an enzyme hunter into a gene hunter. Enzymes are his first and last love. He criticizes biologists for being dazzled by the power of recom- binant DNA technology. Though he admits that "analyzing and rear- ranging DNA has produced aston- ishing results," he claims that "atten- tion to the enzymes that actually make and operate the cell has not kept pace." To him DNA and RNA provide the script, but the enzymes do the acting. Without knowing and respecting enzymes, better still loving them, answers to the most basic questions of growth, devel- opment, and disease will remain beyond reach. BIOLOGY TODAY 57</page><page sequence="4">In this quote and in this whole book, Kornberg comes across as a man consumed by a love of enzymes and a love of research. But these are hardly his only loves. His book is dedicated to the memory of his late wife Sylvy, whom he calls "my greatest dis- covery." (Being an incurable ro- mantic, this sold me on the book be- fore I had read a single word of text!) She too was a biochemist and worked in the lab with him while raising three sons. These boys played in the lab as children and early learned laboratory techniques. Kornberg took them with him when he traveled. He didn't allow science to separate him from his family, instead making it a family ac- tivity. The result is that the older two, Roger and Tom, now are noted bio- chemists themselves. While the youngest, Ken, did not pursue a ca- reer in science-he became an archi- tect-he specializes in the design of laboratories and research buildings. Scientists are often portrayed as cold, rather unfeeling individuals in- capable of close personal relation- ships. Kornberg's life reveals the fal- lacy of this facile characterization. And in a new melding of the scientific and personal, Kornberg had his second wife, Charlene, do the illustra- tions for this book. Her diagrams of complex molecules such as FAD and NAD are particularly good because they indicate, through different colors, the origins of different parts of the molecules. A Lesson for Teachers I hope that I've conveyed the idea that For the Love of Enzymes is a won- derful book. It is one that almost any biologist would enjoy, and it carries a particular lesson for biology teachers. Komberg, like Hoffmann, shows that science can be made to have a human face, that revealing why scientists like science is not an impossible task. At one point, he describes a conversation he overheard between two students leaving a lecture he gave on DNA polymerase. One said to the other: "How dull it must be to purify en- zymes." This comment "saddened" Kornberg. (It reminded me of my first semester teaching nonscience majors, when I discovered that they did not find protein synthesis nearly as fasci- nating as I did.) He thought that "perhaps I should have tried the mountain-climbing metaphor." This refers to a metaphor he uses earlier in the book. I think quoting from it here is an appropriate way to end this column. I don't know if it would con- vince students how exciting enzy- mology is, but it gives a good indica- tion of how Kornberg feels-as a sci- entist and as a human being-about his work: Enzyme purification . .. often seemed like the ascent of an uncharted moun- tain: the logistics resembled supplying successively higher base camps; pro- tein fatalities and confusing contami- nants resembled the adventure of un- expected storms and hardships. Grati- fying views along the way fed the anticipation of what would be seen from the top. The ultimate reward of a pure enzyme was tantamount to the unobstructed and commanding view from the summit. Beyond the grand vista and thrill of being there first, there was no need for descent, but rather the prospect of even more in- viting mountains, each with the promise of even grander views.
