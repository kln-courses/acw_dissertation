<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND THE NEW EARTH Cecelia Tichi BOSTON UNIVERSITY As an advocate of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote in Common Sense: "We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to the present, hath not appeared since the days of Noah until now. The birthday of a new world is at hand." Paine might have said that the birthday of the New Earth was at hand, for his words ring with the millennial fervor characteristic of much American literature of the time. Writers of the American Enlightenment committed themselves seriously to the idea that the New Earth of Revelation (21:1) could be wrought from American soil. In part their American New Earth was made possible by the eighteenth-century belief not only in social and earthly improvement (the word Puritans so often invoked), but in human progress both in spiritual and material realms. Belief in progress was bolstered by assumptions of plentitude in nature, which alleviated fears of human exhaustion of the world's resources and tended to encourage their exploitation for the betterment of the human condition. Moreover, strong convictions of man's power to effect environmental change, together with English esthetic models that provided a new vocabulary and belletristic prestige to landscape change, gave impetus to themes of environmental reform in the American Enlightenment.1 These factors, however, were subordinate to the one transcendent idea that changed American writers' environmental sensibilities and sanctioned environmental reform in America by placing it in a new epochal context. As influential as were attitudes toward progress and plentitude, the powerful idea that surpassed these others and brought about radical change in the way American writers regarded the environment was that of the American Revolution. Whether one saw it (as Mercy Warren did) principally as a military event or viewed it (in John Adams' terms) as a revolution within Americans' minds in the fifteen years before muskets fired on the Battle Green, the Revolution held one meaning central to American thought of the post</page><page sequence="2">The New Earth 203 Revolutionary and Early National period. By concensus such writers as Warren, Adams, Philip Freneau, Timothy Dwight, Joel Barlow, and the geographer Jedidiah Morse affirmed that with the Revolution, the Golden Age of Liberty had begun. It was no longer in the future, nor even near at hand, but vibrant in the actual present. (The sudden spate of Rising-Glory-of-America hymns in verse and prose marked and verified the Age of Liberty as an article of literary faith.) The Revolution was thus no mere sign of the beginning of the millennial Age of Liberty; for many writers it was the beginning. Rhetorically this inaugural millennium found expression in the Isaiahan phrases that the Puritans had invoked spiritually, but that Post-Revolutionary writers cited environmentally. Timothy Dwight witnessed the transformation of "an absolute wilderness" into or chards and farms and remarked, "Considerable tracts I have traced through the whole progress from a desert to a garden; and have literal ly beheld the wilderness blossom as the rose." "Such sights," he said, "when seen only in prophetic vision, enraptured the mind even of Isa iah; and when realized, can hardly fail to delight that of a spectator."2 David Humphreys hearkened to the same prophesy, emphasizing the power of industry that "changest nature's face-thy force is such,/ Ev'n desarts blossom at thy genial touch."3 Magazine contributors took up the same theme. "Part of yonder western wilderness is now budding like the rose-and her barren wastes are turned into fruitful fields .... We may anticipate the peri od, when the yet uncultivated desert will become the center of this ris ing Empire, and exhibit to mankind the splendid monuments of art and labour; when civilization will tame the untutored mind, and savage cruelty be no more a terror to the human race." One writer exhorted his audience to "remember that the invincible industry of our ancestors caused the desart to change its original unwelcome aspect" and re minded them that the "extended fields" that supplanted sites of Indi ans' war councils "declared the first dawn of civilization." Still an other: "America three hundred years ago was a howling wilderness. Ferocious beasts and unnumbered tribes of savages were its tenants." Now, "The beast and barbarian have fled before the sons of Europe as the dew before the sun. America has risen to the zenith of celebrity. The arts and sciences, philosophy and religion here flourish with im mortal vigour." Moreover, the American "sons of freedom" with their example of "virtue and liberty" have transformed the "howling wil derness" into a "paradise of nature in America."4 "Parson" (Mason L.) Weems provides in his Life of Washing ton (I8oo) an excellent example of the new environmental accept</page><page sequence="3">204 Early American Literature, Volume XI, I976 ance made possible by the Revolution. Concerned as he is to por tray the father of the nation as a pastoral-agrarian patriarch at Mount Vernon (and thus no militarist at heart), Weems addition ally proves in his landscape description that the Revolution, sym bolized in Washington, changed Americans' environmental sensibili ties to make the man-land relationship a harmonious one. Thinking back to 1753, to the beginnings of the French and Indian War when young George Washington was about to travel inland to the unex plored Ohio, Weems's description of the Alleghenies is a baleful cata log: "immeasurable forest," "gloomy haunts of ravening beasts and murderous savages," "awful silence," "dreary woods," "hiss of rattlesnakes," "shrieks of panthers," "yells of Indians," and "howl ing tempests." This passage, wrought for propagandistic effect, serves another purpose when contrasted with Weems's picture of the post-Revolu tionary American continent, a picture that not only encompasses ide alized bucolic scenes, but celebrates those of fearful sublimity. The mythic Washington who explores inland, sires his nation, and is virtually assumed into heaven, so sanctifies the American environment that Weems can now celebrate its geomorphology. The same terrain which in the pre-Revolutionary dark ages had prompted fear and loathing, now in early national America becomes "that greatest Con tinent" rising "from beneath the frozen pole," stretching far and wide to the south, "on her ample sides the roaring shock of half the watery globe." Further, "equal to its size is the furniture of this vast continent ... so far superior to any thing of the kind in the other continents, that we may fairly conclude that great men and great deeds are des tined for America." It is an America whose terrain, imagined to be re pulsive before the Revolution, now, in a messianic early national period, warrants celebration and incites optimism for the future. But what of the actual environment on which this international, millennial "epoch" began? In the inaugural Age of Liberty, what ob tained in a landscape that not only had been the setting for urgent moral regeneration, but had been itself the source of contentious atti tudes and of reformist imperatives for some one and one-half centu ries? To put the case from the viewpoint of the American writer: the prophetic, visionary moment had arrived; the literary task ahead was to enmesh the idea of the New Earth with reportorial images of.the American topography. Within the purview of the New Earth, an in tractable, forbidding landscape filled with topographical obstacles would be conceptually abrasive-worse, contradictory to the very spir it of the new age. And yet there remained ineluctably the same kinds</page><page sequence="4">The New Earth 205 of geophysical features that earlier generations had loathed and felt impelled to change, and that were no more welcome to those of the post-Revolutionary era. Fens, floods, and unrelieved vistas of undulat ing treetops were no more appealing to writers of the American En lightenment than they had been to Puritans more than one century earlier. Moreover, post-Revolutionary writers could not honestly avoid the apparent contradiction between the utopian concept of the American New Earth and the intermittently irksome-worse, peril ous-actuality of its topography. Millennial vision and topographical sight were at odds with one another, not only in tension but in appar ent contradiction. Optics and imagination had thus to be reconciled within some center of conviction. We find writers doing so in two ways: they portrayed the landscape in willing collusion with its hu man reformers, and they displaced the geophysical troubles of the pres ent into the past. For the latter, we find that the Timothy Dwight who travelled so much in the New York and New England outback at the turn of the nineteenth century could not really bring himself to say how discour aging contemporary travel was; instead he displaced his feelings into historical sympathy for the first settlers of New England. "A reflecting traveller passing over these roads is naturally induced to . . . realize some of the hardships those intrepid people endured in settling this country," he writes. Then, listing dense forests, bad roads, dangerous streams, swamps, mires, and a bestiary of wolves, bears, and cata mounts (in addition to Indians), Dwight regrets most of all the colo nists' helplessness before it all: "The forests they could not cut down; the rocks they could not remove: the swamps they could not causey, and over the streams they could not erect bridges. Men, women, and children, ventured daily through this combination of evils; penetrated the recesses of the wilderness; climbed the hills; wound their way among the rocks; struggled through the mires; and swam on horseback through deep and rapid rivers."5 The early colonists may be indomi table, but they are forced to accommodate to natural conditions because they are impotent adversaries of an intractable and overwhelming en vironment. Readily could such attitudes as Dwight's be channeled toward the past. As Joel Barlow said ostensibly of the early colonists, "Their enemies were the elements of nature yet unsubdued." More frequent-and more important-than displacement of en vironmental difficulties from present to past is the literary alternative of representing Americans in creative harmony and partnership with their environment. Anthropomorphic as it is, this mode is the more im portant of the two because it truly reconciles the visionary moment with the optical report contradictory to it. It does not require displace</page><page sequence="5">206 Early American Literature, Volume XI, 1976 ment of present to past, and can subsume topographical enormity with in the millennial epoch. The American continent, sanctified by the Revolution, becomes the spatial manifestation of the New Earth. And its inhabitants (Indians excluded) are the chosen people whose re forms, welcomed by the earth, complement and bring to perfection the original work of genesis. As is, the New Earth is viewed as complete but yet rude, unfinished. As artist-engineers those Americans newly born into liberty are called to their apparent task. As David Humpreys put it, human industry would "mend . . . rude nature's works." Since human industriousness can "turn Nature's wilder growth to human use," Humphreys begs: Give me the music of the sounding axe Let the keen adze the stubborn live-oak wound And anvills shrill, with stronger strokes resound. In all this there is no expression of contention between the natural world and colonial efforts. On the contrary, a "grateful nature, cloath'd in harvests, smil'd" at its transformation. Should that process be viewed as a military conquest of the "hardy cultivator" over "sav age NATURE" (and Colonel Humphreys was often disposed to think in such military terms), still the impact of conquest is softened as the environment plays the part of a coy Cinderella: "NATURE herself, once rustic and rude, now embellished and adorned, appears the lovli est captive that ever fell to the lot of a conqueror!"6 Using the same sexual figures whose meaning Annette Kolodny has recently brought to our attention, Dwight too describes the har monious partnership of Americans with their land. "In a word," he writes, "whatever is rude, broken, and unsightly on the surface will, within a moderate period, be levelled, smoothed, and beautified by the hand of man. Where nature, stripped of her fringe and her foliage, is now naked and deformed, she will suddenly exchange the dishabille; and be ornamented by culture with her richest attire." Then, says Dwight, "The meadow will glow with verdure, and sparkle with the enamel of flowers. Flocks and herds will frolic over the pasture; and fields will wave with harvests of gold."7 In his Columbiad the agnostic maker of myth Joel Barlow re writes Genesis so as to emphasize this reformist partnership between Americans and their continent. For Barlow and Humphreys and others so to render that relationship indicates how the redemptive ideology of the Revolution accommodated the eighteenth-century confidence in man's power to alter his environment and the English esthetic models for artful reshaping of the landscape. More than that, it proves on what basis Americans of the post-Revolutionary and Early National period were able to confront and accept the vastness of the new land, to praise</page><page sequence="6">The New Earth 207 grandeur and to celebrate size and scale that had appalled their seven teenth-century counterparts. This bond of the Revolution with the American environment is instanced elsewhere in the Columbiad in a scene of Homeric imitation. Throughout his epic Barlow was head-on with the vexing problem of severe cold and its hammerlock on vast areas of the New World. Others had proposed forest clearance as the means of changing cold climates, and Barlow agreed. But the magnitude of the required effort moved him to Homeric imitation as an act of faith in future possibili ties for American climate control that might liberate vast continental acreage. Specifically, Barlow elevates frost to the godly status of Frost and vanquishes him in epic battle-though not before his Columbus learns a sober lesson in geography and cryogenics. In South America glacial conditions invade and perennially hide mountain peaks. There fields of ice continuously deflect the sun's rays in a blinding glare ("heaven's perennial day"), while in the northern hemisphere Frost holds in "ice-bound jaws" its victims, these being streams that seek succor in spring neap tides that break the ice into "crystal mountains." Even then, facets of a "million mirrors mock the solar ray," and ice burgs flowing sluggishly downstream pose a threat of "insidious death," one contemporary instance of which Barlow recounts. Even though Barlow's genius of the Western hemisphere, Hes per, distracts the anxious Columbus with more heartening topog raphical features, Barlow returns intermittently to the mythified enemy that seasonally or climatically impedes water transport, itself Barlow's personal sine qua non of America's millennium. While Hesper fairly gloats that "vain proud Frost has no domain" in the Mississippi Val ley, nor over any of its waters, the Hudson's Bay region provides som ber contrast. Snow chokes the vegetation, and human life constricts to a primitive level. Here "joyless seasons hold unequal sway." And here Barlow resorts to Homeric imitation when he writes into his Revolu tionary War passages the epic battle scene in which Frost is put to rout. The scene is that terrible Trenton winter. The Delaware is frozen, though Washington and troops cross it undaunted by the enemy Flood, whom they vanquish with their oars, but who in de mise calls to "Almighty Frost" for aid. True to form, "the monarch mounts the storm" and in a swirl of snow and hail freezes the waters. The very waves "conglaciate," by which Barlow intends that they look at once violent and fixed, like those of an inept seascape. It is Hesper, the continent's guardian genius, who rises to oppose Frost. "I come," the spirit announces, "not to insult the brave, [but to] teach the proud stream more peaceful tides to roll." He adds that</page><page sequence="7">208 Early American Literature, Volume XI, 1976 "this land, these waters and those troops are mine," and vows to dis patch Frost to his proper polar domain. The chill foe lets loose one pine tree javelin, which falls harmless. And though Barlow tries for epic effect with Hesper pulverizing ice chunks, it is really prosaic heat that vanquishes the mighty foe-the very solution that land clearance and cultivation offer on a mundane level.8 The battle is a typical confrontation between contending epic gods, but important in that it occurs in the American Revolution and involves Washington. The battle for liberty is thus joined with the battle for the environment-for the very continent. Poetically the episode is unsuccessful, but Barlow asserts in it a relationship be tween the Revolution and the freeing of vast continental acreage to man's reforming hand. It is a concurrent liberation of the spirit and of the land itself. For Barlow, together with his literary confreres, continued to think of landscape change as reform that must proceed together with the reform of the human spirit. On this point writers like Timothy Dwight, David Humphreys, and especially Barlow part company ideologically from their Augustan models. For English belles lettres offered an esthetic but not a socially inclusive (much less millennial) vision of the reconstructed landscape. Were the extant American literary record on the environment confined to the "improved"' estate, say to Monticello, to Joel Barlow's Georgetown Kalorama, or even to John Adams' Mount Wollaston farm, which in old age he spoofed as "Montezillo" to Jefferson, then we could accede to the long-held notion that on this point as on others the Americans were but Augustans-come-lately. Even Timothy Dwight could be forced into the mold, had he not in addition to Greenfield Hill also written the four-volume work of travels into unsettled New York and New England where "the eye perceives a prevalence of forest . . . in so vast an expansion." The fact is that American writers could not allow the nation to be represented geographically by estates or plantations, those oases of self-sufficiency, nor to be encompassed mimetically by the narrow strip of the civil Eastern seaboard. For the idea of nationality-the ideographic America that descended directly from Winthrop's "City upon a hill"-now assumed specific geographic definition on a con tinental scale. Thomas Paine, more than any other writer, seems responsible for that definition. In the times that tried men's souls, Paine equated American independence with "independency of this continent," and spoke of the Revolutionary era as "the seedtime of continental union, faith and honor" (italics mine). In the more than one hundred thousand copies of Common Sense dispersed through the</page><page sequence="8">The New Earth 209 colonies in the weeks following its January 1776 publication, Paine's readers saw the cause of the Revolution focused in this geographic way: " 'Tis not the affair of a city, a country, a province, or a king dom; but of a continent-of at least one-eighth part of the habitable globe."9 Thus writers of the American Enlightenment reached be yond parochial political geography and beyond national emblems of the enclosed garden. As of 1776 they really had to. Yet in order to feel free enough not only to confront a seemingly illimitable and troublesome landscape, but to impose upon it a thoroughgoing vision of utilitarian and esthetic reform, American writers needed a tremen dous new center of belief. They needed-and found-in the Revo lution the phenomenon of cosmic moment that could encourage their geographic outreaching and validate the new environmental sensibility on a continental (or even bi-continental) scale. Yet these same writers, it must be noticed, bore the burden of proof of this epochal New Earth that by definition prompted accept ance and celebration but additionally compelled validation. By themselves, borrowings from scriptural rhetoric would not do. Super nal visions would not do. Specifically, since the American Revo lution was thought to initiate the millennial New Earth, writers were pressed to substantiate their conviction by citing those parts of the American topography that were, if not blatantly paradisal, at least hospitable to man. Some good evidence was needed to prove that the North American continent had all along been a proper, destined site for the redeemer nation. If for the most part the country had still to be earned by its people, the beginnings of the New Earth required proof of inherent environmental felicity. In this regard the wilder ness, howling or benign, was limited in value. Now gardens were called for-though with the proviso that they be inhabited by re generate Americans. By definition the New Earth must manifest hospitable features, and for the first time, in a manner of speaking, geography was summoned to prove destiny. Now Yankees needed the features of the Southern pastoral Eden to verify their own ideas on America. The spiritual election of America was thus proved in a certain predestination of geography itself. "Have not God and nature done wonderful things for us?" one writer exclaims. Another boasts, "Thus situated, the United States appear formed by nature for a great, permanent, and independent government." In much the same way a third writer urges us to trace the network of Western rivers and to "examine the luxuriant soil which those rivers traverse." "Then we ask, can the God of wisdom and nature have created that vast country in vain? Was it for nothing that he blessed it with</page><page sequence="9">2IO Early American Literature, Volume XI, 1976 a fertility almost incredible? . .. View the country, and you will answer for yourselves."10 This idea of geography as destiny, which suited proponents of the Louisiana Purchase and so nicely fit the concept of manifest destiny, apparently made possible for the first time in American culture the reconciliation of two deeply rooted and opposed conceptions of the American environment: that of the New England howling wilderness and that of the Virginian pastoral Eden. The two would not meet in literary work of uncompromised esthetic achievement until Whitman, but it was this apocalyptic view of the Revolution that enabled the change from the New World to the New Earth in American literature.
