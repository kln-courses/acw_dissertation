<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jersey Devil. By James F. McCloy and Fay Miller, Jr. (Wallingford, Pennsylvania: The Middle Atlantic Press, 1976. Pp. 121, illustrations. $8.00) To my knowledge, this is the first book-length study of the folklore phenomenon known as the Jersey Devil. This short study might well be no longer than it is, for a definitive work is not probable, given the recurrent nature of the Jersey Devil scare. The Jersey Devil legend seems to have originated in 1735 in New Jersey, in what was then a much larger Burlington County than at present. An old woman named Mother Leeds, who already had too many children, wished that if she had another child, it would be a devil. No sooner did she give birth than the new child was transformed into a winged being with horns and leathery skin. It bit its mother on the breasts and flew up the chimney and away. Through the centuries it has returned from time to time, to some as a marauder, to others as a useful harbinger of war. McCloy and Miller's book gives this version, then goes on to recite a goodly number of scare episodes. In the main, it treats the Jersey Devil as a bird-like form, although it does devote some space to anthropoid versions that seem to link the Jersey Devil to Sasquatch. (This is also the view of Gordon R. Strasenburg, Jr., in "Perceptions and Images of the Wild Man," appearing in the Fall 1976 issue of Northwest Anthropological Research Notes.) McCloy and Miller fail, however, to run the full gamut of Jersey Devil forms. There are mammalian forms, such as deer, and anthropomorphic forms-an executed slave and a hatted (because horned) intruder on a dance floor-which fill out the canon of Jersey Devil stories. Further- more, there is not enough attention to detail. The Jersey Devil's tracks, for example, link it to</page><page sequence="2">862 BOOK REVIEWS identical reports from Great Britain, Continental Europe, and the polar regions (see my article, "Claws, Hoof, and Foot: the Devil's Tracks in Devon and New Jersey," in the Spring 1976 issue of Free State Folklore). Thus, the book could be more comprehensive. One quarter of the text is devoted to 1909, the biggest year for the scare. The book as a whole does treat the historical chronology of scares--apparitions, weird cries, curious hoof prints, inexplicable mayhem-but geography tends to be confusing, except for the very fine plates used to illustrate the 1909 occurrences; and the importance of the phenomenon would be better served by inserting in the text a chronological table to show the close continuity of the scares. Three other considerations point to the limited value of the book. Daniel Leeds, the seventeenth-century eccentric whose genealogical line seems to have produced "re-births" of the Jersey Devil in the form of retarded children, appears nowhere in the book. Yet it was this querulous Quaker-turned-Episcopalian whose pamphleteering and almanacking brought upon him the wrath of Benjamin Franklin, who prophesied the death of Leeds in one of his own almanacs; and Leeds incurred such spleen as to be hounded into the woods by the displeased townsfolk. Surely the repercussions of religious, commercial, and political rivalry through the centuries, and even family traits, beginning with the fiery and fantastic progenitor, Daniel Leeds, would go far to explain why to this day the Jersey Devil is alternately called the Leeds Devil. Secondly, the book totally ignores the popular culture aspect of the Jersey Devil, except for mentioning the Jersey Devil cocktail at the Smithville Inn outside Atlantic City. The former mayor of Jersey City whose speedboat bore the name Jersey Devil, a professional hockey team and a semi-pro football team named after the Jersey Devil, the erstwhile Devils and Devilettes marching clubs around Salem, New Jersey, and countless other popular devices attest to the fact that the Jersey Devil is the state mascot. Finally, there is no attempt to tie the Jersey Devil legendry into the art of the folktale. In my own examination of the subject, both in the available literature as well as in fieldwork, I have found nothing beyond the fragmentary episode, whether in print or in oral transmission. Yet it is inconceivable that well-rounded tales, transmitted orally or in writing or in both forms, would not be available to identify "The Jersey Devil" as a folk-art form. We have found that the folklorist can move successfully from fragments to tales when exploring the Indian tales, the deer hunters' yarns, and the strong man legends of New Jersey. The same must be true of the Jersey Devil. Nevertheless, if McCloy and Miller's book were in paperback, it would make a good economical text for use in a folklore class since it leaves much more room for exploration and demonstrates a clean-cut program for examining this phenomenon-or any phenomenon-a fairly sizable body of testimonies arranged chronologically followed by alternative theories to account for the phenomenon.
