<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANT HEAP by Vincent J. Dethier. 1979. The Dar- win Press, Inc. (Box 2202, Princeton, New Jersey 08540). 151 p. $7.95. Charming, even beguiling, this short story concerns a fictionalized account of a rebellion by Ants Against the Matri- archy organized by several dissidents who contrary to genetic consignment, were specialists in doing nothing. Woven from the whole cloth of his own special- ization on insect feeding and behavior, Dethier's tale is a marvelous ploy for con- veying a great deal of good biology-the role of trophollaxis and other scents as communication media; aphid farming and milking; the care, feeding, and pro- tection of eggs, larvae, and the queen (variously called Munificent Multipara, Her Felicitous Fedundity, etc.); the matri- archal organization of an ant society; behavior preceding and during nuptial flight; and yet more. The personification of the leading characters is parfait for linguiphiles (as well as taxonomists): Curtipennis Wheeler, Nigricornis Was- mann, Publicollis Lubbock, Fulminosa Fielde, Hurculeanus Sudd, and many more delightful pairings. There is literary license of some magnitude to be sure in attributing such anthropomorphic attri- butes as scheming, planning, debating, and deliberating and in describing nup- tial-time appearances of lithe, sleek, and athletic males and smooth, soft, and de- sirable princesses. All this adds since Dethier is here not so much pure scientist as whimsy. But, in fact, it is not pure whimsy at all. It is a carefully controlled and contrived commentary on a stereo- typed behaviorist autocracy confronted by an insurrectionist attempt at democra- tization, if not socialism. The plot thickens page-by-page and the last line is in the best of the 0 Henry tradition. To describe the plot would destroy its humor and its seriousness. No question but what this ought to be required reading for biologists and biol- ogy students of any age, and maybe even of would be monarchs in per- petuity. Edward J.
