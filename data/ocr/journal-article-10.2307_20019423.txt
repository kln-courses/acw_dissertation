Stud. 26, pp. 415-426 ROBERT JOHN SHEFFLER MANNING DAVID HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION: OTHERNESS IN HISTORY AND IN TEXT In the autumn of 1915 at Princeton, the graduate student, Charles Hendel, and the professor, Norman Kemp Smith, went for a walk. Hendel thought the time auspicious to announce his desire to write a dissertation on Rous? seau. As happens not infrequently between an adviser and a student, Kemp Smith attempted to dissuade his student from his intention and advised him to look into David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, instead. The professor noted that a 'deadlock' had long existed between those who thought the sceptic, Philo, spoke for Hume, and those who thought the theistic views of Cleanthes most nearly echoed Hume's true opinions on religion. Perhaps through researching the problem, Kemp Smith suggested, Hendel could 'resolve that impasse and establish Hume's position on the religious question'.1 Hendel took his mentor's advice and concluded that what Hume was really doing in The Dialogues was giving vent to the uncertainties in his own mind, so that not any one of the characters, but only the narrator, Pamphilus, who expresses the views of all the characters, can be identified as Hume. As to how Hume actually did finally answer the religious question, Hendel modified the traditional ' Cleanthes is Hume ' argument by stating that we may take Pamphilus' endorsement of Cleanthes to mean that Hume himself agreed with the 'anthropomorphic theism' expressed by that character.2 This clever solution did nQt settle the issue, and the deadlock was not only not resolved, but greatly heightened, when, in the Introduction to his 1935 edition of The Dialogues, Kemp Smith reached quite the opposite conclusion as had his student and declared quite unequivocally, ' I shall contend that Philo, from start to finish, represents Hume'.3 Since then, the view of Kemp Smith has most often prevailed, but as some recent articles illustrate, the deadlock is far from resolved.4 By analyzing the hermeneutical pre? suppositions of both sides of the argument, I hope to show not only why it is more probable to identify Philo with Hume, but I also hope to see in the 1 Charles Hendel, Studies in the Philosophy of David Hume (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1925), p. vii. 2 Hendel, p. 347. 3 Norman Kemp Smith, Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (New York: Social Sciences Publishers, 1948), p. 59. 4 See Jeffrey Wieand, 'Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues', Journal of Religion, lxv (January 1985) ; also H.

My contention shall be that the deadlock that still exists over which character speaks for Hume is a result not only of the ambiguities and the irony within the text, but is also a result of deficiencies in the way we most often view texts, history, and the relationship between texts and their historical contexts. Our resolution of the deadlock can, hopefully, not only help us to better understand Hume and his Dialogues, but it can also help us to perform what Gadamer called the truly critical task of hermen eutics, which is to distinguish 'the true prejudices by which we understand, from the false ones by which we misunderstand'.5 This is to say that the dispute over Hume's Dialogues may make evident to us what our herme? neutical presuppositions allow us to see within a text, and what they prevent us from seeing. Hume's Dialogues are a three-way conversation among Demea, Cleanthes, and Philo narrated by Cleanthes' young student, Pamphilus. Demea repre? sents Christian orthodoxy in that he maintains that although God's existence is obvious to all, his essence and his attributes are so far superior to those possessed by humans that we would never know of them were we not aided by revelation: 'The essence ofthat mind, his attributes, the manner of his existence, the very nature of his duration; these and every particular, which regards so divine a Being, are mysterious to men' (p. 141). To Cleanthes this is mere mysticism, for his faith is not in revelation but in the power of human reason, which regards design in the universe and correctly concludes there? from the existence and nature of the designer. Thus, the basis of his anthro? pomorphic theism is the argument for God's existence from the design in the universe : The curious adapting of means to end throughout all nature resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance, of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble, and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man... By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity and his similarity to human mind and intelligence. It is much more problematic to determine Philo's position. In the first eleven dialogues he voices sceptical views opposed to Cleanthes' argument from design. However, at the beginning of the twelfth and last dialogue he says he is actually in agreement with Cleanthes and gives his assent with great enthusiasm to the argument from design. By the end of the twelfth dialogue, he has changed again and concludes that we can deduce from the universe only the most dubious and nebulous theism which only makes more pro? nounced our need, not for philosophical reasoning, but for revelation. At this point in our discussion, suffice it to say that Philo either is, or pretends to be, 5 Hans-Georg Gadamer, Wahrheit und Methode (Tubingen: Mohr, i960), p. 312.</page><page sequence="3">HUME ON NATURAL RELIGION 417 a philosophical sceptic, and at least in the first eleven dialogues all the rhetorical cleverness he can muster is directed against Cleanthes' use of the argument from design : Is the world, considered in general and as it appears to us in this life, different from what a man or such a limited being would, beforehand, expect from a very powerful, wise, and benevolent Deity? It must be strange prejudice to assert the contrary. And from thence I conclude that, however consistent the world may be, allowing certain suppositions and conjectures, with the idea of such a Deity, it can never afford us an inference concerning his existence. The battle lines seem to be fairly clearly drawn. Hume is either supporting the positive and theistic arguments of Cleanthes, or the much more negative and sceptical arguments of Philo. Since we know The Dialogues to be Hume's last word on religion, this work has always been looked to to provide the secret as to what Hume himself really believed, and this is why for the last 200 years the question has been asked over and over again but always with urgency: Which views did Hume himself really hold, Cleanthes' positive and theistic beliefs, or Philo's negative and sceptical ones?6 Upon a first reading of The Dialogues, we are all but forced to agree with Hendel that Cleanthes expresses Hume's true views. There are four obvious, textual reasons why it is immediately apparent that this must be : ( i ) As The Dialogues are in the form of a letter from Pamphilus to his friend, Hermippus, they are a more elaborate account of what Pamphilus has already discussed with his friend. Since Hermippus has already been exposed to the conver? sation, he has already judged the arguments, and Pamphilus presents to us Hermippus'judgement - Demea's views amount to 'rigid inflexible ortho? doxy', while Philo's scepticism is judged to be 'careless', but Cleanthes' views are said to illustrate his 'accurate philosophical turn' (p. 128). Thus, at the very beginning of The Dialogues, we are presented with Hermippus' judge? ment that affirms Cleanthes' views over those of Philo. (2) Philo's arguments seem to contend not only with the belief in God's nature and attributes, but also with the belief in God's existence, even though Hume himself in The Natural History of Religion and the narrator and both Philo and Demea in The Dialogues have already stated that the existence of God is self-evident and beyond dispute. Since much of Philo's polemic is directed toward questioning what even he has agreed is beyond question, it appears as though Philo is only pretending to be opposed to Cleanthes' position. (3) After his arguments grow to such a pitch of impiety that they send Demea out of the room, Philo admits that he was really just jesting, and he confesses his belief in the argument from design. Even though you know I love to argue, Philo says to his friend Cleanthes, you also know that ' no one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays more profound adoration to the divine Being, 6 James Noxon, for instance, in his essay in Hume, edited by V. C. Chappell, has written than unless the question of who speaks for Hume can be answered, 'Hume's last philosophical testament provides us with no clue to his own religious convictions'.</page><page sequence="4">4l8 ROBERT JOHN SHEFFLER MANNING as he discovers himself to reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature' (p. 214).7 (4) At the very end of The Dialogues, Pamphilus confirms Hermippus' view that Cleanthes' arguments are to be most highly esteemed : ' I cannot but think, that Philo's principles are more probable than Demea's ; but that those of Cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth' (p. 228). In arguments for identifying Cleanthes' views as Hume's own, one or more of these reasons is certain to appear. B. M. Laing, for instance, concludes on the basis of reasons (2) and (4) that there is no difficulty in deciding that Cleanthes is Hume - Hume in an earlier work, The Natural History of Religion, and in The Dialogues says that the existence of God cannot be questioned, and at the conclusion of The Dialogues Pamphilus endorses Cleanthes' views.8 Gabriel Compayre admits that at times Philo sounds like Hume, but even so, 'the last words of the book do not permit any doubt' that Cleanthes is actually Hume.9 Similarly, the conclusion of Charles Hendel and, following Hendel, Rudolf Metz and most recently Jeffrey Wieand, that it is Cleanthes who primarily speaks for Hume, depends to a very great extent on Pamphilus' endorsement of Cleanthes at the end of The Dialogues. It begins to seem like an open and shut case, especially when it is pointed out, as is so often done, that Hume himself in a letter to his very good friend Gilbert Elliot in 1751 wrote : ' You wou'd perceive by the sample I have given you, that I make Cleanthes the hero of the dialogue'.10 However, the open and shut case begins to look like a set-up when we inquite a bit further into the purpose of this letter. Hume admits that he has devised so many sceptical arguments that he desires Elliot's help to shore up the theistic position. Hendel's explanation for why Hume might need help in developing theistic arguments to combat the plethora of sceptical arguments that he apparently had no trouble in devising seems strained at best : ' Though making Cleanthes spokesman for himself he did the part of the sceptic so well that he needed the help of his friend Elliot to strengthen the theistic argument... 'n Hendel's explanation is, at least, better than the one J. Y. T. Greig supplied for the same dilemma : '... Philo proved too strong for his creator. Hume had proposed that Cleanthes should remain the hero of the book... But as luck would have it, Philo grew vigorous and strong and bore Cleanthes down'.12 It is difficult to resist suspecting that perhaps the part of the sceptic came so easily to Hume not merely because of his rhetorical cleverness in devising arguments, nor because of his luck, but because he was of a much more sceptical nature than Hendel and the other ' Cleanthes is Hume ' proponents 7 T. E. Jessop rightly points out in his essay 'The Present-Day Relevance of Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion', in Aristotelian Society Supplement xvm (1939) that Philo's conversion in the last dialogue is the primary problem in explaining the work as a whole. 8 B.

The fact that the great majority of the lines in The Dialogues are given not to Cleanthes but to Philo may undercut the thesis that Hume himself actually believes Cleanthes' positive and theistic views. Our suspicions, however, are in conflict with the four obvious, textual reasons we have already outlined why Hume's views are nearest to those of Cleanthes. Ironically, it is a recent apologist for Hendel's thesis who aids us in seeing the hermeneutical presuppositions underlying the ' Cleanthes is Hume ' pos? ition. In his article entitled 'Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues', Jeffrey Wieand discusses the deadlock over the question of which character expresses the views of Hume, and he presents two hermeneutical methods employed to resolve the deadlock: We may be able to solve the problem by consulting Hume's other writings on religion, or Hume's letters, or the works Hume might have consulted in constructing The Dialogues. Thus, the key to under? standing The Dialogues may be in understanding how they are related to other texts, or, on the other hand, the real clue to understanding Hume and his Dialogues may be entirely within the text itself, a strategy which Wieand recommends when he says that if we 'return to the text', it will become apparent that ' the text supports the view advocated by Charles Hendel... '13 Wieand then argues for Hendel's reading by employing some of the four obvious textual reasons we have already advanced. However, even on the purely textual level which Wieand recommends, we may notice many things within the text which throw the ' Cleanthes is Hume ' argument and the similar ' Pamphilus is Hume in recommending Cleanthes ' argument into serious question. If we are to believe that Hume is championing the views of Cleanthes, then why is Philo's voice so dominant throughout The Dialogues? Is it not true that Philo consistently counters Cleanthes arguments, whereas Cleanthes' responses to Philo often amount to repeating what he has already stated ? And if the last dialogue is decisive for demonstrating that Cleanthes' views are Hume's own, then why is Philo so dominant here to the extent that in the last dialogue Hume gives Pamphilus 8 lines, Cleanthes 66, and Philo 458? And if Philo really does recant in dialogue 12 all of his arguments made in the preceding 11 dialogues, thereby giving Cleanthes' the victory, then why does he express in his concluding statement a very obscure and minimalist theism with which Cleanthes would certainly not agree: If the whole of natural theology, as some people seem to maintain, resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined proposition, that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence : If this proposition be not capable of extension, variation, or more particular explication : If it afford no inference that affects human life, or can be the source of any action or forbearance : And if the analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no farther than to the human intelligence; and cannot be transferred, with any appearance of probability, to the other qualities of the mind: If this really 13 'Wieand', p. 34.</page><page sequence="6">420 ROBERT JOHN SHEFFLER MANNING be the case, what can the most inquisitive, contemplative, and religious man do more than give a plain, philosophical assent to the proposition as often as it occurs ; and believe that the arguments on which it is established, exceed the objections which lie against it? Certainly we can agree with Hendel, Wieand, and the 'Cleanthes is Hume ' proponents that the text itself does support the notion that Hume is recommending Cleanthes' use of the argument from design. In fact, from Hermippus' judgement with which the text commences, to Pamphilus' ver? dict which serves as its conclusion, The Dialogues have created the expectation that Cleanthes' views are triumphant. The problem is, however, that The Dialogues frustrate the expectations they create; the text leads us to expect that Cleanthes will have the better of the argument, and that is precisely what does not occur. That is why in reading The Dialogues we have the feeling of being played with, that unusual experience of having the text both build up and confound expectations which Gadamer so aptly describes as the experience of'being brought up short by the text'.14 Exactly so, it is this experience of'being brought up short by the text' that convinces us that the purely textual method of interpreting The Dialogues which Wieand recommends to us will not, as Wieand believes, lead us to an obvious conclusion, but will only lead us to confusion. If we restrict ourselves to the text alone, the question of which character represents Hume boils down to each person's estimation of how ironic The Dialogues are judged to be. Wieand himself recognizes this when he says: 'Clearly there is some irony in The Dialogues. The question is where and how much'.15 Is Philo really sincere when he says he was only jesting in arguing against Cleanthes, or is this ironic? Are we to take Pamphilus' endorsement of Cleanthes seriously, or is Hume being ironic? A purely textual reading never can suffice to determine the extent to which the text is ironic ; for it is, in fact, much more plausible that our presuppositions about where and how much irony is in The Dialogues determine how we read the text than that our reading of the text determines our judgement of the irony. Even the other possible way of interpreting The Dialogues which Wieand points out, i.e. consulting Hume's letters or his other texts which touch on religion, does not permit us to escape from our inter? pretive dilemma because, for instance, we cannot solve the problem of how ironic are The Dialogues by resorting to The Natural History of Religion until we've solved the problem of how ironic is The Natural History of Religion. The move to other Hume texts may seem like it puts us on more solid footing, and many are the critics who have made this move,16 but in reality it only puts us on ever thinner ice. If both Wieand's possible ways of reading The Dialogues - the textual and the intertextual - have not delivered us from our interpretive dilemma in 14 Gadamer, p. 332. 15 'Wieand', p. 37 n. 8. 16 James Noxon states in his Hume's Philosophical Development (Oxford, 1973) that 'the reservations people have about identifying Philo with Hume are mainly owing to Hume's own endorsement of the argument from design elsewhere'.</page><page sequence="7">HUME ON NATURAL RELIGION 421 that they have not provided us with any solid ground upon which to judge just where The Dialogues are ironic, is it not appropriate to suggest another method? Can we not move from the purely textual, and from the inter textual, to the contextual ? In short, it seems wise to inquire into Hume's own historical situation and ask: Is there something about Hume's own particular place and time whcih might have affected how he wrote The Dialogues? Can we find within Hume's own historical context any reason for why Hume might have wanted The Dialogues to appear as though they are supporting Cleanthes while actually giving Philo the better of the argument? It is not merely coincidental that this third interpretive option does not even occur to Weiand, for in Hendel's work and in the essays of the 'Cleanthes is Hume' proponents, questions about Hume's own historical situation have no place. In fact, the historical situation in which The Dialogues were written is never, or almost never, mentioned by those who think that it is primarily Cleanthes who speaks for Hume, and The Dialogues are treated by them as if they are exactly like any other text. If we look into the historical situation in which The Dialogues were written, however, it is evident that they are not at all exactly like every other text in that Hume during his lifetime was never able to publish them. A text substantially completed by 1761 at the latest but withheld from publication until 1779, three years after Hume's death, because it was judged too subversive to appear during the author's lifetime, is decidedly not like every other text. A fact always to keep in mind when interpreting The Dialogues is that even though there is no agreement about which character speaks for Hume, still they were considered so threatening to the society in which they were written that Hume never dared to publish them in his lifetime. The facts surrounding the publication of The Dialogues are well known but rarely mentioned by those who have attempted to interpret The Dialogues. Hume completed a shorter version of them by 1751 and circulated it among his friends, every one of whom, so far as we know, urged their suppression for fear of the abuse they might bring upon their author. Dr Hugh Blair, for instance, wrote from Paris in 1763 that if Hume in his writings had gone 'one step farther ' and openly declared his lack of religious beliefs, the atheistic French philosophes would have erected a statue in his honour. Blair then shrewdly adds : ' If you showed them the MSS of certain Dialogues perhaps that honour may still be done you. But for God's sake let that be a posthum? ous work, if ever it shall see the light : Tho' I really think it had better not. '17 That same year Hume complained in a letter to Sir Gilbert Elliot : Is it not hard and tyrannical in you, more hard and tyrannical than any act of the Stuarts, not to allow me to publish my Dialogues? Pray, do you not think a proper dedication may atone for what is exceptionable in them?18 17 Raymond Klibansky &amp; Ernest C. Mossner, eds., New Letters of David Hume (New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1983), fn 4, pp. 72-3. 18 John Hill Burton, Life and Correspondence of David Hume (New York: Garland Publishing Company, Inc., 1983), pp. 146-7.</page><page sequence="8">422 ROBERT JOHN SHEFFLER MANNING Hume heeded his friends' advice and refrained from publishing The Dialogues. He did not desire to offend those members of the moderate clergy whom he considered friends, and he did not want to increase the controversy his earlier writings on religion had already caused. 'Scotland is too narrow a place for me, ' he wrote to Adam Smith in 1759, ' and it mortifies me that I sometimes hurt my friends. '19 He hints at the controversy his writings have caused in a letter to his publisher in 1762 : ' I am beginning to love peace very much, and resolve to be more cautious than formerly in creating myself enemies. '20 To ensure that The Dialogues would eventually be published appears to have been one of Hume's primary concerns during the last few years of his life. In 1776, when Hume knew his life to be nearing its end, he stipulated in his will that to Adam Smith ' I leave all my manuscripts without exception, desiring to publish my Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'}1 Smith still maintained his opposition to the publication of The Dialogues, so Hume determined to publish them himself. By this time, however, the illness that claimed his life was too far advanced, and he knew he would never live to see his Dialogues come to light. Anxious to make certain that The Dialogues would not be suppressed after his death, Hume altered his will and left the manuscript to his publisher. Hume had the foresight to stipulate that if The Dialogues were not published within two and a half years of his death, they would become the property of his nephew, ' whose Duty in publishing them as the last Request of his Uncle, must be approved by all the World'.22 If Hume had not made this last stipulation just before he died, we might never have had The Dialogues in our literature, for as Hume suspected, none of Hume's friends nor his publisher would sponsor their publication, and they went unpublished until they became the possession of Hume's nephew in 1779 We may better understand the reluctance of Hume's friends to become associated with The Dialogues if we remember the experiences of Adam Smith. His antipathy toward The Dialogues was such that after Hume died he confessed that if the manuscript had been left to him, ' it never should have been published in my lifetime'. Perhaps to relieve some guilt about this, Smith published the well known 'Letter to William Strahan', wherein he describes the admirable qualities of his very good friend, David Hume. What is not so well known, however, is the great regret the author of The Wealth of Nations expressed for having done so : A single, and as I thought, a very harmless Sheet of Paper, which I happened to write concerning the death of our late friend, Mr Hume, brought upon me ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain.23 19 Quoted in The Life of David Hume by E. C. Mossner (New York: Thomas Nelson and Sons, Ltd., 1934), p. 354. 20 Burton, p. 130. 21 Quoted in Kemp Smith, p. 88. 22 Ibid, p. 90. 23 Mossner, p. 605.</page><page sequence="9">HUME ON NATURAL RELIGION 423 If we consider the controversy Hume caused in his own place and time by his writings on religion, and if we remember that Hume twice applied for professorships and twice was denied because of his unorthodox religious views, and if we note the unusual circumstances surrounding the publication of The Dialogues, it seems quite plausible that Hume may not only have wanted The Dialogues to look like they were making Cleanthes' views tri? umphant, but that he even may have had to do this. Kemp Smith has pointed out that attacks upon belief in God and upon Christianity were not permitted by eighteenth-century British society.24 Thus, when historical considerations are taken into account, it seems fairly certain that Philo's views must be defeated and that Cleanthes' views must be judged 'nearer to the truth' if The Dialogues are to remain dans le vrai as Foucault has it, within the boundaries of what a society permits to be said and written.25 It may not, in fact, be too much to say that The Dialogues are in dialogue form not because Hume liked the genre, but because he had to use it. The dialogue form afforded him the best chance at being permitted to say what he wanted to say. And The Dialogues are ironic not because of some inveterate but ac? cidental trait of Hume's character,26 but because they had to be. Hume could not have said straightforwardly what he said ironically in The Dialogues. Wieand is correct in saying that there is irony in The Dialogues and that two crucial questions are where and how much. But another crucial question is, why are The Dialogues ironic? Historical considerations suggest that the irony in The Dialogues exists not for the literary reason of preserving the dramatic interest, but for the practical, and ultimately political reason that The Dialogues had to be presented ironically if Hume were to have any chance of publishing them without bringing upon himself more calumny and perhaps even criminal prosecution. Even though the historical data concerning both Hume's life and The Dialogues are well known, critics have exhibited a curious reluctance, and at times hostility, towards believing that Hume's historical situation might have influenced the manner in which he composed The Dialogues. James Noxon and Nelson Pike contend that Hume did not craft The Dialogues to conform with social conventions because he had not done it in any other work.27 This is a curious remark in light of some interesting historical facts : Hume omitted his essay ' Of Miracles ' from A Treatise of Human Nature for fear it would offend the religious ; he agreed upon the suppressions of his essays ' On Suicide' and 'On the Immortality of the Soul', which were not published 24 Kemp Smith, p. 39. 25 Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge (New York: Pantheon Books, 1972), p. 224. 26 See The Ironic Hume by John Price (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1965). In an otherwise excellent work, Price explains the irony in The Dialogues primarily as a literary device and as an aspect of Hume's character, at the expence of seeing how the irony was forced upon Hume by the societal constraints under which he wrote. 27 See the Noxon essay in Chappell, p. 375; also, see Pike's commentary in his edition of The Dialogues (New York: Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1970), p. 223.</page><page sequence="10">424 ROBERT JOHN SHEFFLER MANNING until 1783 ; and when he criticized the argument from design in ' Of A Particular Providence and A Future State' he used the oldest trick there is, 'I was lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes... ' Noxon also wonders why Hume would ' pay so much deference to social convention in a work planned for posthumous publication... '28 even though there is no evidence that Hume wrote The Dialogues intending to publish them posthumously. Quite to the contrary, he queried his friends for a number of years as to whether it would be wise to publish them, and three months before his death he wrote to Adam Smith, ' If I live a few Years longer, I shall Publish them myself'.29 Pike provides another very interesting reason for not believing that Hume would craft The Dialogues to make them more acceptable to society. He says that this would amount to ' intellectual subterfuge ' and that it is ' a big step to accuse any author' of this.30 If Hume's historical situation were such that the only way he could publish what he wished to publish was to make Cleanthes, rather than Philo, look like the hero of The Dialogues, it is hard to understand how this necessary action can be taken as 'intellectual subter? fuge'. Even if Hume did in fact make Cleanthes his hero not because he really believed in that character's views but because he had to get The Dialogues published - which is at least possible considering that even so he still never published them - this provides us with no grounds for accusing Hume of anything. If anything, it bestows on us not the right to accuse, but the obligation to restore to Hume the right to say what he truly believed concerning religion. Even those critics who believe that Hume did compose The Dialogues to look like they support Cleanthes even though Philo actually voices Hume's true views have shown an inability to take seriously the exigencies of Hume's historical situation. James Orr, for instance, writes that Hume often included in his writings certain pious passages which certainly did not reflect his own beliefs. He did this, Orr thinks, not because he had to get his work published, but because he had a penchant for mocking Christianity, which Orr calls 'reprehensible'.31 Greig says Hume made The Dialogues look less subversive because 'he was desperately anxious to get the book published'. According to Greig, this amounted to 'weakness' on Hume's part.32 Even John Price, who notes that when one is criticizing a society's most cherished beliefs 'irony is frequently the best method of keeping one's skin', still says quite naively: 'Hume could have easily constructed an ending in which Philo's superiority was announced'. In making Cleanthes the hero of The Dialogues Hume exhibited, Price judges, 'admirable artistic economy', not a desire to keep his skin.33 28 Chappell, p. 375. 29 Greig, ed.

Why have critics been reluctant to believe that Hume made Cleanthes the hero because this was the only way he could even try to get his work published, and why have they preferred to believe either that Hume did this because he was malicious, or weak, or because he really did believe that Cleanthes views are 'nearer to the truth?' We may find an answer to this enigma if we evaluate how we usually view texts, how we usually view history, and how we usually view the relationship between the two. Although the hegemony of New Criticism has long since been overthrown, even the most avant-garde theories of reading, as Frank Lentricchia has recently argued, are still dominated by New Critical notions of the text as an autonomous artefact existing in an aesthetic free space, cut off from the historical situation out of which it comes.34 Even a discourse analyst such as Paul Ricoeur, for example, declares his agreement with an 'anti-historical' view of the text, for a text is 'a kind of atemporal object, which has, so to speak, cut its ties from all historical development'.35 With such an anti-historical view of texts, questions we have asked about The Dialogues, such as the historical circumstances surrounding their publication, the religious and political realities which might have affected how Hume wrote the text, are not asked because they are not thought necessary. The meaning of a text, it is commonly assumed, is not within the relationship between the text and its historical situation, but is entirely within the text itself. If we view texts as autonomous objects cut off from the place and time of their creation, and if we think that the meaning the text bears is entirely within the text itself, then the historical considerations lose their point. This is precisely the indictment of our view of texts and of the relationship between text and history made by Edward Said, probably the harshest critic of our New Critical inheritance. Said serves to make us aware of what our anti-historical view of texts has led us to forget : '... nearly everyone pro? ducing literary or cultural studies makes no allowance for the truth that all intellectual work occurs somewhere, at some time, on some previously mapped-out and permissible terrain, which is ultimately contained by the state. '36 Frank Lentricchia argues that our anti-historical view of texts actually springs from an idealistic view of history. History is not the scene of disruption and change, but continuity and sameness. In viewing history as the repetition of the same, Lentricchia contends, we have forgotten the genuine otherness within the past, that other times and other places have genuine differences 34 See After the New Criticism by Frank Lentricchia (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1980). 35 Paul Ricoeur, Interpretation Theory : Discourse and the Surplus of Meaning (Fort Worth : The Texas Christian University Press, 1976), p. 91. 36 Edward Said, The World, the World, the Text, and the Critic (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983), p. 169.</page><page sequence="12">426 ROBERT JOHN SHEFFLER MANNING which we need texts to tell us of.37 But for texts to tell us of the otherness of the past, we need to see then as connected to and rooted in that history which is other. If we read The Dialogues paying no attention to their historical context, if we think the meaning lies entirely within the text itself, then we must agree that the text supports the view that Cleanthes' views are judged by Hume as the most valid. But in doing so, we implicitly assume that The Dialogues are exactly like all other texts, that all texts are the same because all texts are equally free, equally permitted, that all history is the same in that all times and all places allow all authors to say whatever they wish. However, if we follow our feeling of being 'pulled up short by the text', and if we allow the irony in The Dialogues to disturb our confidence in the way we usually interpret texts, then we may well discover that the best way to interpret The Dialogues is to consider their historical place and time. We may decide not only that historical considerations provide us with the most solid ground upon which to make a reasonable conjecture about Hume's true views on religion, but we may also decide that The Dialogues are not at all like other texts precisely because they are rooted and enmeshed in another time, another place very different from our own. A culture in which Hume was not permitted to say what he wished about religion is genuinely other than our own, perhaps more so than we realize. And The Dialogues are different because they are a product of this otherness. The otherness of the text results from and, if our reading will allow it, testifies to the otherness of the past, the otherness within history. We do not contend that every text should be read this way, or that this is the only appropriate way to read texts. But we do contend that this is the best way to offer an educated guess as to where The Dialogues are ironic, which is, in fact, at the root of that most perplexing question : Which character speaks for Hume? If we are correct, our interpretation not only shows that Philo should be identified as the real Hume, but it also restores to Hume the right to say what he truly thought about the religious question. If this be true, then we may say that in the case of Hume's Dialogues, an historical reading and an ethical reading are one. Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. 37 Lentricchia, p. 109.</page></plain_text>
