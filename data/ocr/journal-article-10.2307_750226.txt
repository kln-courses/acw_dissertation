<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NEWLY DISCOVERED MANUSCRIPT OF OPICINUS DE CANISTRIS A Preliminary Report By Richard G. Salomon O picinus de Canistris (1296 to about 1350), formerly known as the Anonymus Ticinensis, is the author of a description of Pavia which Muratori published in I727.1 About forty years ago, Richard Scholz found a second work of his, a political treatise De preeminentia spiritualis imperii,2 a contribution to the great literary controversy provoked by the conflict between Pope John XXII and Emperor Louis the Bavarian. The identity of Opicinus with the Anonymus Ticinensis was first publicly stated by Faustino Gianani3 in 1927, in connexion with the discovery of a third work which has no title: a collection of rather fantastic drawings, maps and graphic schemes contained in Cod. Vat. Palatinus 1993. The collection is supplemented by notes in a peculiarly crabbed Latin which however helped to explain, at least partly, the meaning of the pictures. An edition of the whole collection, with com- mentary, was published in 1936 as Volume I of the Studies of the Warburg Institute.4 By far the most interesting part of this manuscript is a plate containing very full autobiographical notes covering the first forty years of the author's life (P1. I2), a rare piece from an age not rich in autobiographies. The notes are presented in a most peculiar arrangement: they are inscribed into a scheme of forty concentric rings each of which corresponds to one year in the author's life. A calendar ring surrounding the whole system gives every single day its fixed place within the scheme. With remarkable precision, often veri- fied by documentary material available elsewhere, the author has registered the events of his life in their chronologically correct place. The treatment which Opicinus gives to his life betrays an amount of interest in his own personality, which has few parallels in mediaeval literature. There is not much between Salimbene's recollections and Petrarch's Epistle to Posterity that compares in any way with the close self-analysis in which he indulges in these notes and, even more so, in the other plates of his collection. He goes so far-and this seems to be unique in his period-as to illustrate his autobiography with a series of four self-portraits representing him in various stages of age. 1 Anonymi Ticinensis Commentarius de laudibus Papiae; Muratori, Scriptores rerum Italicarum, XI, I727, pp. 1-48; replaced by the admirable edition of Rodolfo Maiocchi and Ferruccio Quintavalle (Muratori, Rac- colta degli Storici Italiani, nuova edizione, XI, p.

Opicinus himself quotes it in his later works as Libellus de descriptione Papiae; it seems however advisable to keep the traditional name. 2 Richard Scholz, "Unbekannte politische Streitschriften aus der Zeit Ludwigs des Bayern" (Bibliothek des Kgl.

SALOMON In its outer events Opicinus' life is not exceptional or conspicuous. It is the career of a lower clergyman, typical of the time, it seems, in its hardships and vagaries.' Born in 1296 at Lomello, the son of a Pavese family, he was early destined for an ecclesiastical career. A listless student, he compensated himself for the boredom of the school curriculum by reading poetry, studying French and Italian books and by drawing. At twenty, he worked as a tutor in a noble family. Political changes drove him and his family out of Pavia to Genoa where he learned book illumination in order to make a living. Return- ing home in 1318 he received a chaplaincy at the Cathedral and entered holy orders; in 1323 he was elected rector of the humble parish of St. Maria Capella which he kept until five years later political and financial difficulties forced him to leave the city again. At this time he had already started to write: among his early products, of which none has been conserved, he mentions a poem on the parables of Christ, a treatise on the ten commandments, and a booklet on the poverty of Christ. Reduced to beggarly circumstances, a homeless vagrant in Lom- bardy, he tried to build a new career on his literary capacities. He wrote the political pamphlet mentioned above, De preeminentia spiritualis imperii. Though poor in original ideas, the booklet dealt with a subject of topical interest for the day and served his personal purpose: Pope John XXII accepted the dedication and rewarded the author with the appointment to the position of a scriptor in the office of the Poenitentiaria Apostolica, in which he remained, a permanent resident of Avignon, at least until 1348. Shortly before he entered into his new position, he had finished the most attractive of his writings, the De laudibus civitatis Ticinensis. Stylistically this book is very different from the pedestrian dissertation on the Preeminence of the Spiritual Empire: it gives an uncommonly vivid picture of life in Pavia, drawn with a loving hand and showing an astonishing familiarity with the topography, the history and the usages of the city. Muratori's com- pliment is well deserved: "the author draws old Pavia so beautifully and exactly that we believe with pleasure that we see it with our own eyes." Jacob Burckhardt also has a kind word for the book. The inner life of the author, as reflected in his autobiographical notes, was full of difficulties. He reports on early religious experiences; at twenty- five he finds himself involved in "intricate scruples"; in his years of parish work and later on his conscience is perturbed by a feeling of his own insuf- ficiency, professional as well as social, and darkened by the reminiscence of early sins. His physical condition is not too good; he mentions a breakdown at the age of thirty-two, from which however he recuperated. A more serious attack of illness came a few years after his appointment to the Poenitentiaria Apostolica. The medical report which he gives deserves translation: "On March 31, 1334, I fell sick. I received the sacraments and was near death through the first third of April. When I came to, I found my limbs out of action. About this time I dreamed that I was in Venice, a city 1 For the following see the text of the autobiographical notes in Salomon, IA, pp. 205-219.</page><page sequence="3">12 li -4- ril i4? ?4 Wii!!!ii ......;iiN4N i't TA xzii~i C lot Opicinus de Canistris, Autobiographical Scheme; Vatican Library, Cod.

When I opened my eyes, I be- lieved myself to have awakened from eternal sleep and to have been re-born into this world. I had forgotten everything and could not even remember how the world looked outside of our dormitory. On June 3, after Vespers, I saw a vessel in the clouds. In consequence of the disease I was mute, my right hand was lame (debilis) and I had lost in a miraculous way a great deal of my literal memory (= positive knowledge). In the night of August 15 I saw in a dream the Virgin with the Child in her lap, sadly sitting on the ground; and through her merits she has given me back not the littera (knowledge) but a double spirit. Since February I, I335, I began to retire, bit by bit, from my work in our office (the Poenitentiaria) because of the weakness of my hand. In a spiritual work however this same hand proved stronger than before: since then it has drawn all these pictures (the plates of Pal. 1995) without any human help. At present [i.e. June 1336] my lost literal knowledge is replaced twofold by spiritual knowledge; my right hand is weak in worldly work, but strong in spiritual endeavours." The product of this period of illness is the collection of drawings in Cod. Pal. 1993: fifty-two on twenty-seven parchment sheets of very large size (between 28 in. and 36 in. in length), most of them made between February 1335 and June 1336, only a few added at a later time.1 On all of them the basis is neatly and exactly worked out with ruler and compasses; and a host of figures, representing the Church, Christ, the Virgin, the Zodiac, the animal symbols of the Evangelists and many others, is drawn on such a geometrical background. A certain artistic talent is evident, for instance in a beautiful Crucifixion group2 or a very original drawing of the Zodiac ;3 but its free display is limited by a hankering for symmetry and adaptation to the given geometrical schemes. The margin is often filled with jottings more &amp; propos of the drawings than explaining them. The only connecting link between the very disparate subjects treated in the individual drawings and notes is the author's own inner life. In some way everything in these improvisations and graphic experiments is connected with his anxieties, self-reproaches, hopes and fears. If this unorganized agglomeration of pictures has a general theme, it is Opicinus himself. Thrown back on himself in consequence of his illness, desperately miserable and lonely, and dominated or almost enslaved by the trend of his time towards symbolism and allegorical interpretation, he sees his own problems symbolized everywhere: in constellations, in place names, in Bible words, in events -of his own former life, literally in everything in heaven and on earth. He is painfully aware of his own sinfulness; he sways between ambitious, even megalomaniac dreams of possible high preferment and longings for a sinless life in humble station; helplessly groping for a way towards salvation, yet tortured by forebodings of inevitable damnation. Symbolical interpretation, moralizatio, of the visible world was nothing new in Opicinus' world; any mediaeval handbook from Physiologus to 1 All reproduced in Salomon, IB. 2 Salomon, pl. XII. 3 Ibid., pl. XXX. 4</page><page sequence="6">48 RICHARD G. SALOMON Thomas of Cantimprd gives examples of this. It was however Opicinus him- self who applied this method to a new field: to the new map of the world which since the end of the thirteenth century began to replace the old circular mappa mundi of the Ebstorf and Hereford type. The famous earliest specimens of this new type, representing the Mediterranean area in a style more similar to a modern atlas than to the mappa mundi-the so-called Carte Pisane, the Carignano map and the various maps of Petrus Vesconte-were in existence already when Opicinus began to work. On some such map Opicinus, who had for a long time been interested in geography and topography, discovered what every schoolboy has since discovered for himself: the boot form of Italy. But he saw a little more: that if one sees the map with the west side up, Europe looks somewhat like a crippled human being, with Spain as its head; and that with some good will one can discover the outline of another human being in the configuration of the coastline of Africa. Furthermore, if the map is turned the other way, with the east on top, the Mediterranean Sea can be taken as the figure, also crippled of course, of a seated man with a huge beard. The result of this discovery is shown on P1. I 3b: Europe is a man, Africa a woman whispering into his ear; between them, upside down, a bearded man is enthroned. It is in line with late-mediaeval thought that this observation threw Opicinus into a state of trepidation. Since everything must have a symbolical meaning, the anthropomorphic configuration of the world had to be inter- preted, moralized like the animal kingdom, the Bible or the text of Ovid. Opicinus not only repeated the drawing several times in his collection, directly or mirrorwise; he dabbled with the problem in innumerable passages in his notes and expatiated on it in unending variations. The deep pessimism of his interpretation is not surprising: the sinful world is in itself the symbol of sin; the Europe-man and the Africa-woman are, as it were, Adam and Eve in the moment of the fall; the place where they approach each other, the Straits of Gibraltar, symbolizes the origin of all evil. The Mediterranean- man dominates the whole area from his throne; he cannot be anything else than the Prince of this World, the Devil. And so the Mediterranean Sea becomes, to Opicinus, the mare diabolicum. If this were all, the Opicinus map would be no more than a pictorial appendix to the moralizing handbook of geography written by Opicinus' contemporary Petrus Berchorius.' But Opicinus goes farther. The map has also a personal significance for him; it symbolizes not only sin in general, but his own sins: the man and the woman represent, among other things, his soul and his body. As astrology sees the destiny of a human being written in the stars and tries to decipher the heavenly text, Opicinus sees his own destiny written in the configuration of the continents and tries to understand that script. The painful self-analysis provoked by this attempt culminates in what is perhaps the most personal or intimate picture in the collection, a confessional or psychological self-portrait (P1. I 3a). The drawing shows, under the heading: "The overbearing Pharisee," a priest in eucharistic vest- ments, with the inscription "thus I look outwardly in my pride." The breast of this figure is open and contains, in mirror reversion, the Europe-man and 1 Reductorium morale, bk. XIV.</page><page sequence="7">A NEWLY DISCOVERED MANUSCRIPT OF OPICINUS DE CANISTRIS 49 the Africa-woman, the symbol of sin; and here another inscription is added: "Thus I am inwardly in my pride." Here the tormenting problems are brought into a comparatively simple formula. It is impossible here to follow Opicinus on all the dark paths and count- less by-ways of his meditations and speculations. His expression is often enigmatic, lacking logic and coherence. Involuntary and irresistible associa- tions provoked by a single word or a name cut across the way of his thought and lead his argumentation astray, not rarely into mere verbiage. The indications of some mental disturbance are evident even to the medically untrained reader. Quite recently an experienced specialist in psychoanalysis has studied the case and given his verdict.' He characterized "picinus as a schizophrenic, the victim of an "obsessional-compulsive soul- searching" process and of "delusions" producing (or caused by?) a psychosis. It was just about the time when this psychiatric study of Opicinus was published that the Warburg Institute received word of the discovery of another manuscript of Opicinus, the uncatalogued Cod. Vaticanus lat. 6435. Professor Roberto Almagik had found it while preparing his Monumenta Cartographica Vaticana.2 The notification which he was kind enough to send to the Warburg Institute was unfortunately lost because of bad mail connexions during war- time. Thus it was only in 1952 that the Institute received a microphotograph of the manuscript. Meanwhile Professor Almagia had published a brief description of it.3 The task of analysing the new find has devolved with a certain necessity on the present writer who made the edition of the Palatinus. A few observa- tions, based on a brief and not too thorough acquaintance with the text, are offered here for preliminary information. The Cod. Vat. lat. 6435, entirely written and designed by Opicinus, con- sists of 22 paper quires of 4 double-pages each, a total of 176 pages, of which the first two are almost entirely destroyed and not numerated. A custodian, XXIII, at the end of the last quire indicates that at least some pages have been lost. The book is a continuation of the picture collection; different in form but related in contents. It is a day-book; not a diary in the usual sense, but a collection of Adversaria written down day by day, short notes and long essays as disparate in character as the plates of the older manuscript. They concern the inner life and experiences of the author, commonplace events of the day, reminiscences, complaints, fears, regrets and hopes. Religious meditations, theological dissertations and scholarly exercises are scattered through the whole book, a De omnibus et de quibusdam aliis which is not easy to take. Some- where Opicinus characterizes these endeavours as a studium ad veram scientiam capiendam, a desperate wrestling for higher truth, maior scientia in contrast to what he now calls scientia naturalis, knowledge of facts. Many of the entries are dated. Opicinus has a chronology of his own, 1 Ernst Kris, Psychoanalytic Explorations in Art (New York, International Universities Press, 1952), pp. I18-127: A Psychotic Artist of the Middle Ages. 2Roberto Almagi ", Monumenta Cartographica Vaticana, 3 vols., Citti del Vaticano, 1944- 1951. 3 Ibid., I, pp. 95-98, and pl. 48.</page><page sequence="8">50 RICHARD G. SALOMON using symbolical names for the different years; a system which he had already started in the last part of his autobiographical notes.' He calls 1335 the annus expectationis I336 ,, ,, retributionis I337 ,, ,, renovationis 1338 ,, ,, perfectionis I339 ,, ,, revelationis 1340 ,, ,, coronationis 1341 (?) ,, ,, tranquillitatis Since he adopts these masks regularly at the beginning of a year, they cannot mean more than a formulation of special hopes or expectations. The day dating is normal. So it is easily seen that Opicinus started this new manu- script about the end ofJune 1337, and continued writing until the beginning of November of the same year. In 1338 he went through the whole manu- script, adding a great number of entries on the lower margins of the pages; in the following years, at least up to 1341, he added a few more notes. At some time he provided the individual entries with brief headings in red ink, and tried to systematize the unwieldy mass of material by entering capital letters and arabic numbers on the left margin in order to bring inter- related notes together. The letter I for instance marks entries discussing problems of the calendar, N seems to indicate political subjects, mainly concerning Lombardy and Opicinus' home city, Pavia; T, and especially T6, is used for his personal affairs, and so on. The system however seems to be not quite consistent. Besides the text, the new manuscript contains some twenty full-page map drawings and about a dozen smaller pictures of various subjects. As for the origin of Opicinus' cartographical work, Professor Almagia has corrected the present writer's former assumption that the maps of the Palatinus can be traced back to one model, and has proved from a passage in the new manuscript that Opicinus had various maps, of Genoese and Majorcan type, at his disposal in Avignon.2 Opicinus however states also (f. 53) that it was Genoese material only that made him acquainted with the new type: Ianua dedit viam scientie describendi mundum Papie. "Genoa taught (the man from) Pavia how to design world maps." Two entries (f. 59 and 6o) prove that the technical problems of cartography, especially the treatment of distances, were not unknown to Opicinus; but in general he is as unconcerned with the practical side of cartography in the Vaticanus as he was in the Palatinus. The treatment of the maps is the same in both the manuscripts: they show the Mediterranean basin and the surrounding countries with human features added (P1. I3b); with the difference only that in the new manu- script Opicinus no longer restricts himself to the one formula of Europe as a 1 Salomon, p. 214. 2 Almagia, op. cit., I, p. 97.</page><page sequence="9">A NEWLY DISCOVERED MANUSCRIPT OF OPICINUS DE CANISTRIS 51 man and Africa as a woman. On some maps Europe is the woman, Africa the man; sometimes they are men or women both of them; an unlimited play of fancy which provides the author with material for further bizarre allegorical interpretation. Even more than the Palatinus the new manuscript is dominated by the idea of this human configuration of the map. All through the text of the book Spain is the head, Southern France the breast, Lombardy the abdomen and Italy the right leg of the Europe man or woman. The diction is conceivable only on this basis; formulas like Avinio pectoralis, Lombardia ventralis, Roma tibialis appear on almost every page. The psychical crisis which demonstrated itself in the drawings of the Palatinus evidently continued through the years in which Opicinus worked on the new manuscript. He appears here as persistently self-centred as in the Palatinus, but the method, if the word is admissible here, seems even sharper than before. What he was aiming at in his feverish production is indicated in a remark towards the end of the notes (f. 77v): Unusquisque exponat spiritualiter vitam suam secundum memoriam eorum que gessit. Similiter exponat quid significet genus suum cum omnibus actibus suis. Simili modo omnia sompnia sua que poterit ad mentem reducere. Et omnia conferat cum conscientia sua. Tunc omnibus discussis si repererit ex huiusmodi collatione vel mendacii vel fidei veri- tatem, obtinebit per gratiam dei donum iudicii sue persone non aliene, exemplo mei ipsius. "Let everybody explain in a spiritual way his own life according to what he remembers; let him explain the (spiritual) significance of his family and its deeds, and also all the dreams he can recollect, and discuss all this with his own conscience. Thus he will be able by the grace of God to find the right judgment about his own person, as I am trying to do." For his own person he has followed this advice. To a large extent the notes read like an allegorizing commentary to the autobiography which he included in his older manuscript. There is nothing that escapes this treat- ment; the fact that as a boy he worked for some time in the customs office at the bridge (pons) of Bassignana, "meant" his future entry into the ministry (pontificium); his apprenticeship in the book-illuminating trade indicated the later illumination of his conscience. He even subjects his eating habits-"at breakfast I eat like a wolf, in the evening much less"-to an allegorical exegesis: "when I was young I devoured a great amount of learning, and did not pay attention to the intellectual hunger of others; now in the evening of my life I am willing to share my knowledge with others" (f. 70v). Little commonplace events in his daily life are scrutinized for their "spiritual" meaning: a donkey runs away in his neighbourhood-this must "mean" something; but since Opicinus does not know the answer, he registers the fact and leaves the solution to imaginary readers: "quid ista significent, declaretur per alios sapientes." Things like these are still within the limits of ordinary mediaeval allegoresis and have their parallels in the work of others; but Opicinus goes beyond</page><page sequence="10">52 RICHARD G. SALOMON every tradition in his speculative identification of himself with the Europe- man on his maps: Ego ... ex corpore meo testificor dispositionem Europe (f. 32v). He studies, e.g., the distribution of hair growth on his body and finds that it corresponds to-and consequently "signifies" or even "is"-the distribution of vineyards over the various countries of Europe: Condensitas pilorum colli mei est copia vinearum Wasconie. Similiter spissitudo pilorum pectoris mei significat vineas circa partes Provincie. Pili ventris mei sunt vinee Lombardie. Crura mea pilosa sunt orientalis Italia et Dalmatia cum Sclavonia ut arbitror habundantes in vineis. Tergum autem meum nullos vel modicos pilos habet, id est Germania raras vel nullas possidet vineas (f. 32v-33). Applying such methods of interpretation he is able to explain a constipation which bothers him for some days as "signifying" the political troubles in "venter Europe," i.e. Lombardy (f. 13v). A rheumatic pain in his left hand, which prevents his touching his shoulder, "means" the failure of a planned German attack against France, since France on his maps is the shoulder of the Europe-man. The new manuscript shows that Opicinus considers his discovery of the symbolical meaning of the map as a decisive event in his life. He differentiates between the periods before and after the discovery of "the mystery" (adhuc ignorans misterium; f. 75v). He speaks about it with a certain pride (f. 77v): Numquam vidi fieri mappas maris nec curavi videre fieri eo quod ignorantia mea non permittebat me talia scire. Solus autem deus aperuit mihi intellectum ut ad exemplar alterius illam transcriberem nemine me docente, ignorante me tamen presens misterium nisi postquam a terribili infirmitate convalui usque ad annum expectationis. "I never saw maps being drawn nor was I interested in that because my ignorance did not allow me to know such things. God alone gave me the understanding so that I became able to copy a map without anybody showing me how to do it. I did not know however what mystery was hidden in them until 1335 after I had recovered from my terrible disease." A longer note (f. 83)v, which might be given here as a specimen of Opicinus' style, discusses the interpretation of the map: Asia in similitudine arboris est tota materialis et capax cuiuslibet forme secundum industriam architecti vel sapientis artificis. Europa in simili- tudine animalis indifferentis partim est materialis, que adhibita ratione formantis potest formari in hominem vel in animal brutum. Affrica vero in similitudine hominis potest de facili plus formari in hominem, non in aliud animal, secundum liniamenta membrorum et vestium. Similiter mediterraneum mare non potest formari in aliud nisi in diabolicum mare. Occeanum autem mare a Scotia usque ad verticem Affrice sic potest formari a pectore usque ad lumbos eo quod caret capite et cruribus. Cuius pectus occupant insule purgatorie scilicet Hibernia et Anglia. Ubi enim</page><page sequence="11">A NEWLY DISCOVERED MANUSCRIPT OF OPICINUS DE CANISTRIS 53 est major copia ecclesiasticorum proventuum in argento et auro, ibi est acrius purgatorium cum tormento. Ab insulis illis usque Hispaniam Britannicum mare est stomachus instar mortis que omnia devorat ore suo. Secundum latitudinem Hispanie est venter Occeani, et inter Hispaniam Europe et Mauritaniam Affrice est vulva Occeani, de qua procedit mare mediterraneum. Mare autem rubrum vel Indicum et mare Caspium ceteris relinquantur qui habent scientiam plage orientalis. Insule vero mediterranei maris possunt formari ad similitudines navium vel mem- brorum humani corporis dispersorum aut ossium seu viscerum vel informes relinqui. A translation word for word is hardly possible. The meaning is the following: Asia looks like a tree (as stated several times in Opicinus' notes but not appearing on his maps), but can be drawn in any other form depending on the capacity of the designer. Europe can be drawn as a human being (as always on his maps) or an animal (not in the maps). Africa can easily be transformed into a human being, not into an animal, using the coast- line as the contour of members and garments. The Mediterranean Sea can be transformed only into the Devil. The Ocean from Scotland to north-west Africa can appear as a body without head and legs. In the breast of this body are the islands: England and Ireland. (Then follows one of the derailments characteristic of Opicinus' style: for some reason he considers the British Isles as symbolizing Purgatory and cannot repress the association, although it breaks up the context.) The Britannic Sea between Britain and Spain looks like a lion, the devouring symbol of death ("stomachus" being a mask for "leo," borrowed from the well- known astrological bleeding charts which put the parts of the human body in parallel with the signs of the Zodiac. On several maps both in the Palatinus and the Vaticanus this is carried out; the lion biting into the hump of the Europe man).1 On the geographical latitude of Spain there is the belly of the Ocean, and between Spain and Mauritania the vulva Oceani from which the Mediterranean Sea proceeds. The Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Caspian Sea should be left to those familiar with the geography of the East. The islands of the Mediterranean can be drawn in the form of ships or as dispersed parts of the human body (indeed Sicily appears on many of his maps as the heart of the Mediterranean Devil), as bones or entrails, or be left without a specific form. Beside this playful pictorial treatment of the map Opicinus has another method of using it for his purposes, which appeared already in the Palatinus. He experiments, as it were, by superimposing one map on another and draws conclusions from the resulting coincidences of names and places-a method faintly reminiscent of Raimond Lull's techniques. He draws, e.g., a map of the whole Mediterranean region over a large-scale plan of Pavia (f. 84 and 84v) and points out that under such treatment his old parish church of S. Maria 1 See Pls. 13b and I5.</page><page sequence="12">54 RICHARD G. SALOMON Capella falls on the African section of the other map, "is in Africa," whereas the church of his family which he attended in his youth, S. Tecla, "is in Europe." Africa serving here as a symbol of sin, hypocrisy or the like, and Europe representing purity, salvation or piety, this provides him with further material for his pessimistic self-analysis. A peculiar trait in the drawings as well as in the text is the obvious tendency towards prurience. Some signs of this appear already in the Palatinus draw- ings; the Vaticanus indulges freely in obscenities; certainly a fact which the psychiatrist will not overlook. Opicinus was conscious of what he was doing: on one of his plates which shows a rather fantastic anatomy of the female abdomen (f. 87), he entered the following note: Hora, qua hec agebantur, necesse habui operire quodam folio papiri ventrem mulieris propter superventionem Lombardi presbiteri simplicis, ne scandalizaretur ob hoc. "While I was working on this, a simple priest from Lombardy came to see me, and I had to cover the abdomen of the woman with a piece of paper in order not to shock him." Of course not everything in the work of a psychopath is pathological. The manuscript contains, as to be expected, a considerable amount of sober state- ments of fact. There is some detail supplementing the autobiography. He tells a little more about the development of the disease with which his psychotic condition started in I334, and of the pilgrimages he undertook to various sanctuaries in order to find healing. He also gives some new detail about his work as a scriptor in the Poenitentiaria Apostolica, with some interesting side- light thrown on the unscrupulous business practices of its personnel (f. 35): Tota die possumus videre bestiolam cuiusdam speciei quam nos vulgariter scuriolum appellamus inclusum in tornatili cavea, qui volens ascendere prepediente vertigine cavee numquam pervenire potest ad finem; qui motu suo facit apparere moveri per duas humanas ymagines sculptas et extra caveam stantes, que magis moventur ab ipso.

Sum vere scuriolus, id est animal curiosum. Cor enim meum simile cordi maris in medio Laberinti tota die noctuque laborat per vagos circuitus cogitandi ad mendacia adinvenienda. Sicut Sicilia interpretatur laboriosa, ita Laberintus vere dicitur "labor intus." Again this defies verbal translation. The text is furnished, as usual, with intricate allusions which can be explained only by comparison with similar passages all through the manuscript ("Sicilia laboriosa," perhaps somehow connected with the Terra di Lavoro), plays of words (cura, curia, curiosus, scuriolus), and fragments of unrelated information (Labyrinthus). What he means is this: We keep a squirrel in a turning cage which is in fact moved by the animal itself, but seems to be turned by two little figures of men affixed to the cage on each side. The position of the squirrel is similar to that of Sicily on the map between the two figures of Europe and Africa. Both these things are symbols of Opicinus himself in his position as employee in the Poenitentiaria Apostolica. Like the squirrel he works without end and without result. The cage is the throng of business. The figures are the litigant parties between whom he stands as proctor, advocate or mediator, and it seems as if it were the parties that make him move. In fact however he himself strives to enlarge the amount of business for reasons of filthy lucre, his heart is busy day and night to invent lies. Opicinus' literary horizon appears not much wider here than in the Palatinus. What he quotes are the school authors: Boethius, the Macrobius commentary to the Somnium Scipionis, the Ilias Latina. Traces of more recent literature are, it seems, restricted to quotations from Geoffrey de Vinsauf's Poetria Nova, another school book. His theological knowledge however is broad: he knows Hugo of St. Victor; a long essay De regula sancti Augustini (f. 28v-29) shows familiarity with canon law and ecclesiastical history. He proudly tells that Pope John XXII once called him a philosophus. Some colourful strokes enliven the picture of life in Avignon: for instance a notice on a cardinal entertaining the Pope's guests with magic tricks (f. 58v) or the description of an accident connected with the construction of the papal palace. Even such commonplace pieces of local news are often presented in an oracular style reminiscent of the diction in political prophecies, such as the Sibylla Erithrea or the Liber de oneribus prophetarum. The following entry (f. 77v) is typical: [Anno expectationis] paulo ante subtracto summo pontifice IIIIor de senioribus populi migraverunt, ut incepto iudicio a sanctuario dei iusti principes terre subtraherentur a nobis, et ne nos in desperatione re- maneremus, plures ex eis supersunt nobiscum.

Nunc ab occidente usque septentrionem homo et ab oriente leo superstites hospitium nostrum communiunt. De officio nostro plures circa predicta tempora similiter sunt defuncti. "[In 1335], shortly after the Holy Father had died (John XXII, d. Dec. 4, 1334), four of the elders of the people left us, so that by the judgment coming from the sanctuary of the just God we were bereft of the princes of the earth. But lest we remain in utter despair, several of them are still surviving. In 1336 three of them died after the first group, so that in about two years seven princes died after the supreme shepherd. Out of these seven in 1335 the eagle and in 1336 the ox, animals of the faith, died, the one east, the other north of my abode. Now our living quarters are in connexion only with the man in the north-west and the lion in the east. During the same time several colleagues in our office also died." The "elders" and "princes" are evidently cardinals, and the set of four animalia fidelia -which in Opicinus' style does not mean "faithful animals" is easily understood as the symbols of the evangelists. A look into the chronology of the cardinals1 shows that indeed four cardinals died in 1335 and three in 1336; among them Johannes (the Eagle) Caietani de Ursinis and Lucas (the Ox) de Flisco. Of the surviving two "symbolic animals" the Man is cardinal Matthaeus de Ursinis (d. 1340). The other name, Marcus, required by the Lion does not appear in the list of cardinals as of 1336-1338; but evidently Cardinal Neapoleo de Ursinis (d. 1342) is meant. As far as Opicinus looks beyond the precincts of Avignon, his political interest is concentrated in both the manuscripts on his home city Pavia, for which he has the hate-love of the fuoruscito, and on Lombardy in general. Unending and monotonous condemnation of the Ghibellines and expressions of hope for a final reconciliation between the Lombards and the Papal See are the gist of his political meditations. The greater problems of the day like the conflict between Pope and Emperor or the Italian policy of the Curia are occasionally mentioned or hinted at, but nothing has been found as yet in his texts that would change the existing picture of the period. The local history of Pavia might be able to gain some new material from the Vaticanus. Opicinus evidently consulted his older work on Pavia, De laudibus civitatis Ticinensis, most intensively during his writing, about as intensively as he made use of his autobiography; and elaborated here and there some topographical detail. The maps of Pavia at the end of the manuscript seem to deserve attention. An entirely new feature appearing in the Vaticanus which has no parallels in the Palatinus is a strong interest in the lingua volgare, North Italian as well as Provencal. Occasionally Opicinus makes a note concerning an idiom or quotes a few words. Some of these entries might be useful for the specialist. On the plates accompanying this report some specimens of the drawings in the Vaticanus are reproduced: 1 Eubel, Hierarchia catholica, I, pp. 13-17.</page><page sequence="15">14 4t f'L-10!o4 4.two VV i~wl a-Opicinus de Canistris, Tortoise, Upper and Lower Side; Vatican Library, Cod.

Plate I 4a: The naturalistic sketch of the tortoise is accompanied by a long commentary in which Opicinus states that by careful study of a specimen he found that the tortoise has eleven "teguli" on the under and thirty-eight on the upper side, "non sine misterio": for II + 38 = 49 = 7 x 7. On the lower side he discovered a relief pattern which looks like a human hand, "as if it were made by an artist." "Until now I could hardly believe that pictures of human beings or animals are engraved by nature in many precious stones; now I must believe everything." The "arma Achillis" is a typical case of irrepressible association, the tortoise provoking the reminiscence of the popular tale. The quotation added is Ilias Latina v. 859-862, the passage concerning the weapons of Achilles brought by Thetis. Plate I4b is a morality in three scenes: (i) Two women in the act of giving birth; seen from above, knees drawn up: a lady in costly array lying on a bed with a pillow, and a beggarly woman in tattered clothes, bedded on straw; the naked infants between their feet. (ii) The two children, grown up: the "filius divitis" crowned, sitting on a throne, sceptre in hand. In his breast there is a medallion representing a castle. The medallion is Opicinus' formula for symbolical representation of thoughts (P1. I3a). The "filius pauperis" kneeling, barefoot, in a shabby tunic. In his breast a medallion showing a head (woman?) in profile. (iii) Rich and poor in death, disintegrating corpses in coffins, alike but for the crown of "filius divitis." The commentary states: "The end is the same for rich and poor, just as the beginning." Plate 15 is one of the simpler variations of the map theme. Opicinus' interest for Boethius has patriotic motives: he claims the only martyr of Pavia as a fellow-countryman. In the added notes he identifies himself with Boethius: "What has happened to Boethius, has happened to Opicinus. Boethius went from Old Rome into exile in Pavia; now by the grace of God he (i.e. Boethius-Opicinus) is transferred from Pavia to New Rome (= Avignon)." Three of the inscriptions are quotations from the Consolatio Philosophiae.</page></plain_text>
