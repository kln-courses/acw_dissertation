<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEPARATED SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT Among the greatest services of revealed religion and the Church to man- kind has undoubtedly been the vindicating of the primacy of the spiritual. Scientists and artists whose work is most imbedded in what is fleshly and material will agree that they are absorbed precisely by that which makes man so recognizably different from all other living and material things: his "spirit," however much they dispute what that may mean. The great achievements of culture, philanthropy, and civilization were possible only in proportion as men progressively found a goal worthy of their striving beyond the life of flesh and earth. Valorization of human life itself came with the enlargement of our horizons upon the existence of a "world of the spirit," peopled by beings as unique as man but without his earthy limitations. Man's hope became to share that life as an eventual endless reward, and meanwhile to understand and re-direct his own "spirit" upon the pattern of those "pure spirits" toward which it pointed. Religion itself has been a relentless war for the claims of the spirit against ever-encroaching materialism. Mystery, sacrament, eschatology, merit, and virtue itself, are all aspects of the "primacy of the spirit" in human life. But since all these have their material usefulness too, "eman- cipated religious man" came to find progressively his more perfect symbol in the defense and consideration of those beings whose spirituality is totally uninvolved with the benefits of matter, the Angels. Not that this focus of interest was a new thing. Man's recollection of his most primitive awareness includes a fascination for a fairytale world of spirits about him: elves, sea-sprites, storms ("wind" means "spirit"!), and the oh-not- completely-departed "breath" of our dear ones and our enemies. But since science or rather religion itself inexorably went on excommunicating more and more of these credences from the sphere of admissible reality, our fight for the primacy of the spirit has become progressively a fight to "save what we can." This has brought with it a reluctance to face the similarities between what we have saved and what we have been forced to give up. Yet we know it is more adult to evaluate them dispassionately by the same criteria. We have elsewhere set forth the totality of Church teaching on the soul which made us think warrantable the position of Teilhard de Chardin.1 He endeavored to exalt man's spirit by making it a bridge in uninterrupted continuity between matter on the one hand, and his elusively-divine "Omega" consummation on the other. In the course of our inquiry, we became aware that men's 3000-year 1 R. North, Teilhard and the Creation of the Soul (Milwaukee: Bruce, 1967) 163- 227.

We know that man has a "spirit" or soul differentiated from the soul of trees or earth or animals.2 Because of this we have been able to understand and formulate whatever scraps of information were communicated to us about mys- terious beings somehow midway between God and man. And then in exchange, having attained lucid formulations about the nature and life of these intermediate spirits, the recipients of Semitic revelation went on to draw conclusions regard- ing the nature of man's own imbedded spirit.3 Or perhaps more accurately, they drew conclusions regarding the validity of speculations about the soul and the spirit-world which had meanwhile grown up independently among their Persian and Greek neighbors. Limitations of Our Inquiry Precisely our esteem for the primacy of the spirit should make us eager to retrace and evaluate exactly how and at what points each new develop- ment came in, whether from God directly or from among men, to enrich our knowledge. It seems fair to interrogate the OT. We must not ask tendentious or weighted questions. We must not look "for" something, in the sense of what we hope to find. On the other hand, we must ask some question, and in terms which we of today genuinely have in common with the OT. We are aware that the notion of genuine immateriality is alien to the ancient Semites. It would appear that the word for "spirit," rûah , which occurs in the OT some 76 times in that sense (plus 94 times of God), is never once used for what could be called an angel.4 We are also aware that if the OT uses terms 2 Otherwise Johannes Pedersen, Israel, its Life and Culture (London: Milford, 1926) 1, 479: "We know that the Israelites do not acknowledge any distinction between the psychic and the corporeal. Earth and stones are alive, imbued with a soul." 3 "Scotus could not see a great difference between angel and soul. But he establishes such difference by a highly questionable argumentum convementiae : the higher a creature is, the more subdivisions it must have ; but in order to have more subdivisions in the intellectual world than in the material world, there has to be a specific distinc- tion between angel and human soul. The distinction comes from the fact that the angel constitutes a nature by itself, while the soul is only part of a nature," A. Vacant, DTC (1930) 1, 1231; further 1260: Averroes held intelligences without freedom or matter, intermediary between God and man. The upper ones enlighten and govern the lower. At the top of all is the one sole Intellectus Agens, which moves the moon and enlightens each man's passible intellect. This view was espoused by many at Paris and Oxford, but combatted by Aquinas and condemned by bishops. 4 P. van Imschoot, Théologie de ť Ancien Testament (Paris: Desclée, 1954) 1, 116, holds that rûah has this sense in a single case, 1 Kgs 19,21 : when yhwh called for a volunteer in the host of heaven to tempt Ahab, "a spirit" came forward and said "I (420)</page><page sequence="3">1967] Separated Spiritual Substances in OT 115 which really express an entity of a "nature intermediate between that of God and that of man," then the question of immateriality becomes secondary. The use of the term "heavenly being" seems to be in some authors an escape from focus- ing the realities of the situation.5 But others have carefully-chiseled formulas about "a heaven thickly populated with beings of higher knowledge and greater capabilities than those possessed by men."6 We will not ignore the relevance of these beings which can be called "heavenly." But men also are held to become some day "heavenly beings." And so we have at least some ground for assuming that if there are OT angels with a nature different from that of men, it must be because they are pure spirits. Many who have preceded us in this pursuit, rightly recognizing that escha- tology and magic and morality and immortality and Lourdes and séances and hylemorphism and sacrament are all inseparable aspects of that one reality which we call spirit, have often hopelessly confused the issues by plunging in to solve the whole problem at once.7 It thus becomes imperative to agree that while recognizing the interrelation of the elements, we can solve nothing except by rigidly delimiting inquiry to one thing at a time. Actually anyone who today claims to investigate the origins of our information about angels within the OT, is really claiming to investigate the reality which is today defined "a separated spiritual substance." Such an inquiry cannot be complete, because even the OT conveys its information to us only through lan- guage, and our language itself has progressively evolved under the influence of progressively evolving notions of what the OT meant by what it had to say about angels. But within the framework of that larger inquiry, which we hope to carry through eventually and methodically, it is indispensable that the OT angels should receive a chapter apart, most plausibly as the outset-point. Empirical and statistical evaluation of all OT occurrences of words for angel has already been done, many times. Like the best among those researchers, we too wanted to produce something serene and objective, without polemics or personalities. But we would not wish to ignore two will be a spirit of deception in the mouth of all his prophets." But just as convincingly, L. Hackspill, "L'angelologie juive à l'époque néotestamentaire," RB 11 (1902) 530, says that the "evil spirit" here and in 1 Sm 18,10; 2 Chr 18,18 is "a personification of ideas" ; it is rather arbitrary to exclude the one word rūaķ from the highly meta- phorical heavenly court scene. 6 R. Pautrel, M. Lefèbre, "Trois textes de Tobie sur Raphaël," RechSR 39 (1952) 115, takes as a starting point the fact that the OT knows "heavenly beings" distinct from the theophanic angel and constituting the divine court. 6 Harold B.

One thing is that when many experts have already taken strong divergent positions regarding the same OT data, it is profitless to set forth these data again without pointing out antecedently what to look for as having led to such violent unresolved conflicts.8 The other thing is that no one can evaluate what someone else says about angels without having in his own mind some notion of what angels are, and therefore some notion of what anybody else means when he says angel. Some authors thus unhesitatingly presume that angel means everywhere in the OT that which it means today widely and in the background of the investigator. But let us note that, for better or worse, "angel" is very widely used in America today in contexts which are not theological. Very often it is a term of endearment for unique specimens of either (opposite) sex. Though this usage doubtless preserves some implication of "superiority to normal humanity" (certainly not of immateriality !), what it concretely means is "sweetheart." Orally at least, and perhaps even in print if pulp be included, a statistical tabulation would probably prove that this usage outstrips all others. "Angel" in an entirely different sense is more uniquely American. It means a wealthy man who puts up the money to produce a stage-play. This use is called slang in Webster's otherwise permissive Seventh Edition; but it is really a technical term in an important profession. A Brooklyn or Hollywood shop-girl might quite well have occasion to flip the pages of a Bible to see how many times "angel" occurs. In doing this, if without regard to its context she may assume that it means there what it has come to mean in her own background, then she can assert "From the first page to the last the Bible talks of sweethearts," or of tycoons backing shows. This is es- sentially what an exegete or theologian does when he says, "The Bible from the first page to the last talks of angels." Here is another and more sophisticated exemplification of our problem. One author, by his insistence from the very start of his inquiry that all his predecessors have been misguided by preconceptions of which they were unaware, betrays clamorously that he from the very start is guided by (the contrary) preconceptions which he calls by the name of "rigorous objectivity."0 Another and antithetical Catholic treatment has been shown to fall into the same apriorism.10 It is in German but from Orchard Lake, Michigan.11 It main- 8 See our comment regarding Kings chronology disputes in CBQ 29 (1967) 182. 0 Fridolin Stier, Gott und sein Engel im AT (ATliche Abhandlungen 12/2; Münster: Aschendorff, 1934) 8.

In contrast, the Catholics Lagrange and Touzard are called "wrong but not because of precon- ceptions": their specific contentions, though identical with those of respective rationalists, are fitted into an overall pattern of more indispensably Catholic convictions. From this American colleague we can learn that there are two entirely dif- ferent kinds of preconceptions. I frankly have a preconception that God exists and that whatever he has truly revealed and is taught by the Church is in- errantly true.12 The fact that I and many other people think this is a good and true conviction does not alter the fact that it is a preconception, of the most thoroughgoing kind: one that I am not prepared to abandon, no matter what should be the results of my inquiry into the angels or on any other point. In comparison with that "first-degree" type of preconception, it must be recog- nized that the convictions which various scholars have reached from their study of the angels, and which without any detriment to their whole life-commitment they could readily abandon or alter if continuing research prompted, are here and now genuine preconceptions but of an entirely different "second-degree." In this light, any hundred-percent "objectivity" of research is impossible. Preconceptions, of both kinds delimited above, are here to stay. The only hope is to recognize our preconceptions, chart and evaluate them like all the other empirical data, and give a fair shake to all the rival investigators in determining sympathetically what their preconceptions were and indicating why we never- theless choose to adopt different ones. Our Acknowledged Presupposition Here is the "second-degree preconception" underlying everything which follows. The word angel in English and Latin is a mere transliteration of a Greek word, but in its use and meaning represents a specialization and eventually total alteration of what the Greek word meant.18 The Greek word in its turn was one which had been adopted to render a Hebrew 12 This preconception does not exclude the validity of recent contentions that God envisioned as a doddering authority-figure or as a Greek metaphysical abstraction is "dead," or never existed. Nor does it exclude the claim of Paul Van Buren, The Secular Meaning of the Gospel (London: SCM, 1963) 145: 96, following R. B. Braithwaite, An Empiricist* s View of Religious Belief (Cambridge, 1955) 32, that statements about God convey generally the commitment to a course of action more proximately than the rather obscure informational content upon which that commitment is inevitably based. In Van Buren's jargon, my preconception about a revealing God is a "blik," which could hardly be said for the preconceptions about mal'āk held or rejected by Rybiński, Stier, and myself. 13 This is made gratifyingly clear in the great recent volume of the scholar to whom this essay is dedicated, cited below in footnote 32.

Hence it has seemed to us from the start unwarranted to lay down as "basic" meaning of the Hebrew word rendered by "angel," any sense which does not fit a large number of the contexts. Either we must resolutely hold out for two independent basic meanings without common denominator, as is the case with many Hebrew roots. Or, as is also common amid the caprices of etymology, we can lay down as basic a meaning which fits either or neither of the actual usages, but can be explained as having developed into both. From the start of our present summation it has seemed to us that the basic sense of mal'āk, the Hebrew word rendered ángelos, is "Presence." As applied to God himself appearing to men, this presence may be called "manifestation."15 As applied to messengers sent to men by other men or by God, this praesent-ia can be called re-praesent-atio, a vicarious presence or manifestation of a different type. As implying the "production" of a form or credential under which God makes himself present in a way not normal, the mal'āk is like mHā'ka a form of "work" or operation. Only after having quite independently come to this conclusion by plodding through the Scripture occurrences themselves and a number of modern authors who nowhere mention it, we eventually learned that several German experts a century ago proposed variations of this same root-meaning.16 Hence we feel that it would not be objective, but rather a negation of objectivity, to plunge into the statistics without letting the reader know what brand of allies we have chosen.

Touzard, "Ange de Yahweh," DBS 1 (1928) 242, assumes without discussion that the Arabic, Ethiopian, and Aramaic verbs l'k meaning "send" are not denomina- tives dependent ultimately on biblical mal'äk; see below, footnote 46. 15 Our conclusion is quite independent of a similar sense found in the angelus of some Latin dedications as in footnote 34 below. 16 Otto Procksch, Die Genesis erklärt (Sellin KAT 1; Leipzig: Deichert, 1913) 108, on Gn 16,7: "We can render ' mal'äk , Botschaft' with 'Erscheinung.'

Even in their own day they were attacked.18 The leaders of theological thought have not only ignored them, but firmly and positively laid down contrary antecedent norms. Some Alternatives to What Follows Among the dissenters, one for whom we have most reverence is Briggs in the Gesenius-Brown dictionary. He says unhesitatingly that mďak means three things : an ordinary messenger among men, an angel sent by God, and the "theophanic angel" which is controvertedly an appearance of God himself.19 This is essentially the position of the be.st modern Protestant exegesis. MaTāk is held to "mean," among other things, exactly what is meant and implied by the English word angel. Of course this position is variously reinforced by the mal'äk-t quivalents detected in the NT era Jewish background.20 A rather special interest attaches to the expert Jewish contribution to a recent wide-ranging Protestant enterprise without Catholic cooperation. Gaster yields 17 V. Hamp, "Engel Jahwes," LTK 3 (1959) 879, "manifestation," yet somehow personal: an ambivalence tolerable in view of the simultaneous nearness and remote- ness of God. The sense of "presence," Vergegenwärtigung , seems favored also by Matthäus Ziegler, Engel und Dämon im Lichte der Bibel (Zürich: Origo, 1957). 18 Rudolf Smend, Lehrbuch der alttestamentlichen Religionsgeschichte (Freiburg: Mohr, 21899) 45 : maVãk meant messenger from the start, distinct from yhwh' s appear- ance and not concealing it: yet as a patchwork to reconcile yhwh* s dwelling in one place (Sinai) while working in various places. Vatke and Hitzig also held that maVãk meant originally message-bearer, but as applied to yhwh himself; see footnote 55 below. For Eduard König, Theologie des AT (Stuttgart: Belser, 81923) 190, against Kautzsch, mal'äk originally meant "sending"; against Procksch, the OT had a word for Erscheinungsform, and it was pänim, not mal'āk . 19 In the 1966 Oxford reprint, the supplement on p. 1124 adds nothing to what is said on p. 521 of the 1907 edition. It is not always easy to see the basis on which examples were allotted respectively to the meanings "angel" and "theophanic angel." The alleged meaning "angel" adds no qualification about "pure spirit," and might even be taken as "angel only in the sense of any (presumably human) messenger sent by God," except that Briggs had just rejected the rendition "angel" as too specific for Jb 33,23, "a messenger from God acting as interpreter and declaring what is right." 20 We may note, among numerous treatises of Edward Langton, Good and Evil Spirits : a Study of the Jewish and Christian Doctrine, its Origin and Development (New York: Macmillan, 1942) : Hebrew beliefs in man's surviving spirit are rooted in the animism of Semites and of primitives generally (p. 290) ; Jesus, except as re- gards himself, accepts beliefs current in his time about as they were in the apocrypha concerning departed spirits or heaven and hell. In The Angel Teaching of the NT (London: Clarke, about 1937) 46ff., Langton had spelled out how Jesus maintained a large number of angels, especially guardians; p. 82 cites authorities doubting whether the Sadducees generally denied angels (Acts 23,8).

But he proceeds to find equally convincing examples of such a "reality" in the mythology of Israel's neighbors and the folklore of all nations everywhere.21 He sees the problem in terms of how many extrabiblical resemblances can be found, rather than what the OT word mal'āk meant to those who used it. As against this, recent Catholic treatments exhibit a healthy rationalism which ends up far more conservative. This is commendable even in the DTC article, whose exegetical approach must be deplored. "The existence of angels is af- firmed throughout the Bible."22 As we have seen, the existence of what is called mal'āk is affirmed throughout the Bible, and this is at least partially what is meant by the Greek ángelos. But whether this means, like the modern-language equivalents of Latin angelus , "a separated spiritual substance intermediate be- tween God and man," is not an empirical datum at all, much less an outset-point, but a highly controvertible proposition toward which the inquiry should grad- ually build up. Vacant also says, or premises, "The thought that the angels are distributed in various classes or choirs is manifested already in Genesis where there is question of Cherubim 3:24 .. . Seraphim Isaiah 6:2.,&gt;23 Here again, no one can deny that the Hebrew words kerûb and sãrãp occur, nor that the transliteration of these words has come to have in Latin the meaning of a classment of intermediate spiritual substances. But the exegete's duty is to indicate by chapter and verse the point at which an identity is laid down between mal'āk and k€rûb, within the OT or outside it. On kerûb we are well informed as to what it really meant to the sacred writer and in a far-flung Near East background. It was a composite figure embodying the maximum strengths of various kinds of created reality (bull, lion, eagle, man), as a symbol not of God himself but oí earthy maxima over which God was throned superior.24 The meaning of sārāp is less clear, but in part at least is synonymous with kerûb. Neither word at any point in the OT implies immateriality. Both, however, have wings, which cannot be said of either man or mal'āk .

Is it not strange that the same article which makes so abundantly clear that even a thousand years later what was called explicitly "spiritual" was not truly meant as such, blandly assumed that Scripture without the word really did mean what was meant since the medieval scholastics? "If the OT and the NT represent the angels under human form, they show at the same time by indications getting gradually more precise that these superior beings do not have a material body as does man. Though not expressed by philosophical and ab- stract formulas, these indications are none the less clear." As proofs are cited Gn 18,8 they eat; Jgs 13,16 they don't eat; Tb 12,12 they eat but faking.27 But really if their body is of air or fire-water the question of whether they eat is rather inept.

"The angels are spirits without body" is referred to Wis 7,23, which concerns wisdom, not any angel; also to Heb 1,7.14; where angels are flames, workers; Lk 24,39, a frightening spirit has not flesh and bones like the risen Jesus. But the real reason then given is the negative and scholastic one, "The Bible never speaks of the body or of the soul of the angels."28 The companion article starts out more promisingly, and soon notes that "the belief in beings intermediate be- tween God and men seems to be a common patrimony of human beliefs," but thereupon theorizes "which must perhaps be explained both as deriving from a primitive revelation [ !] and by repeated experience of their actuation, no less frequent than that of demons ... In the OT, angels appear from Gn 3 on."29 Unimpeachable but contrasting in method are four other Catholic dictionary- treatments. Galopin takes as his point of departure the fact that God is often represented in the Bible as an oriental potentate, with his court of retainers varyingly called servants, saints, sons of God: before the exile representing undifferentiatedly the good or evil that happens to men by some kind of will of God. The post- exilic books reaffirm the angels' existence and beneficent operation but "by means of representations and classifications highly symbolical and hence hard to evaluate."30 The angels are said to "escape our ordinary perception and con- stitute a mysterious world," but there is not even indirectly hinted any question as to whether in the OT the mal'āk is either immaterial or intermediate in nature between God and man. John McKenzie says more forthrightly that mďak is "not a spiritual being: the Hebrews did not have an idea of spiritual reality and distinguished heavenly beings from men only in that they were different . . . nothing to suggest that [the messenger] was conceived in any form other than human."31 But McKenzie finds that the "heavenly court" theme is noticeably later ( post but not necessarily propter Persian-Mesopotamian contacts), a development out of an earlier belief in divine messengers, which "wavers between a hypostatization of the divine attributes and a distinct personal heavenly being"; in Is 63,9 md'āk means neither messenger nor angel but "presence" ! Father Hartman's dictionary pleases us by saying that ângelos does not always correspond to mal'āk (where McKenzie perhaps by oversight puts the rendition "messenger" after mal'āk instead of after ângelos ), and more bluntly than Galopin denies that cherubim and seraphim fit into this purview (the wingless mal'āk in Gn 28,10 uses a ladder!); their nature is declared to be in 1 Kgs 28 M.

Thus it paradoxically affords the perfect rendition of nabî', in accord with Westermann's sound analysis of "prophet as Bote" ; this I have shown in detail elsewhere.85 Though meaning strictly "messenger," the Greek ángelos had never- theless a certain religious or "spiritual" connotation quite apart from the 82 W. Grossouw, "Angel," Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Bible edited by A. van den Born2, translation directed and adapted by Louis F. Hartman (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1963) 81.

Stier treats copiously the relevance of such Iris and Mercury figures, but shows more sympathy for a rather identical trend within the Babylonian pan- theon.37 He supposes the equivalence of angel and vizir or prime-minister, and this is vaguely paralleled in Egypt.88 In the Septuagint ángelos occurs 200 times to render the Hebrew mal'āk .89 In eleven other cases, it is the translator's escape for rendering "gods" or "sons of God(s)."40 Oddly, in no one of these 11 cases is the "theophanic angel" mal'āk an alleged synonym of God himself. There are nine other words rendered by ángelos for a total of some 13 occurrences.41 36 Friedrich Andres, "Angelos," in Pauly Real-Encyclopädie (Stuttgart: Meitzer, 1918) 3, 101, thinks possible an etymology of ángelos from Sanskrit angira-s "mythic divine being, divine messenger"; even in profane Greek use it may have had from the start some implication of underworld-demon (p. 114). Andres in Die Engellehre der griechischen Apologeten (Forschungen zur christlichen Literatur 12/3; Paderborn: Schöningh, 1914) 102, gives etymologies of daimõn; and on p. 176 concludes that developments out of the OT data turned out intriguingly similar to end-products of pagan demonology. 37 F.

Then there are 21 occurrences in Tobit alone. Finally there are 21 again in other deuterocanonical books or additions, which we will enumerate below. Meanwhile ángelos is not the only Septuagint rendition of mal'āk . Kircher in fact enumerates only 191 examples of this, as against the 200 we found with the help of Hatch-Redpath.42 Three times it is rendered by the synonym présbys in the sense of legate (Nm 21,21; 22,5; Dt 2,26), and once by the cognate "spy," kataskopeúsas Jb 6,25; twice by the neutral "man" or "boy," (1 Kgs 20,9; 25,42). But in three cases it is "The King" (1 Chr 21,20; Prv 13,18; Is 14,32) ; and in Qohelet 5,5 is "God," reversing the commoner LXX trend to replace 'elõhím by ángeloi . MHā'ka of the Hebrew, though in form an abstract equivalent of mal'āk, is rendered "work," never anything like ángelos . And angelia in Greek, though in structure implying "angel-ness," occurs fourteen times, rendering word, taste, hearing, but never mal'āk ,43 The word mal'āk occurs 212 times in the Hebrew bible.44 It is a noun, in a form which basically means instrument or place.45 a message by the "hand" of a fool; Is 37,24 yad ' ãbãdêkã "by your servants" you insulted Adonai; Prv 13,17 ftr ("goer," envoy) will cover up for a bold king; Prv 25,13, faithful fîr helps his senders; Jer 29(49) : 14, fîr sent to the Gentiles; Dn 4,10.20 'tr "watcher" from heaven to order the tree cut down ; Dn 10,21 ; 12,1 śar , Prince Michael. 42 Conrad Kircher, Concordantiae Veteris Testamenti Groe cae, Ebraeis vocibus respondentes polychrysoi (Frankfurt: Mann, 1607).

Chafer, "Angelology," Bibliotheca Sacra 98 (1941) 412 [99(1942)6+135+ 262+391 mostly about Satan]. Heidt and Dequeker (footnotes 86 and 80 below) dis- cuss angels under numerous names other than mal'āk. We will advert to all the im- portant apparent synonyms; but as a question of methodology we will claim that the equating with mal'āk must be shown within the OT, normally by a passage which includes the term mal'āk. 45 F. Zorell, Lexicon hebraicum (Rome: Biblical, 1964) 438, gives the meaning as "a sending : in Scripture always a person sent with a mandate" ; mHā'ka "primitively a sending to do some work." Hence not structurally unfounded is the proposal of M. Karppe, "Melanges assyriologiques et bibliques," JA 9 (1897) 126-8, to take mal' ak yhwh as God's "striding," though his linking it with hâlak is hard to defend.

This root appears to be known in other Semitic languages only as either equivalent (Ugaritic, Phoenician) or derivative of the Hebrew noun mal'āk ,46 Like the LXX, our Hebrew dictionaries except Zorell suggest no link between their presumed sense of mal'āk and the rather common Hebrew noun mHā'ka which is simply its abstract form. Thus it should mean "send- ing," but in fact it never means this : only work, craft ; service, also in a cultic sense. We will provisionally notice that there is no antecedent reason for excluding "work" or "operation" from the root-sense of I'k . In this light even a term like "demiurge" might be suggested to correspond more non- committally to the implications of mal'āk*1 1000 B.C.: Pre- J Mal'āk Occurrences The OT is not a homogeneous or synchronous book. It is a collection of writ- ings whose literary fixation extends over some 800 years. No text should be given a theological significance apart from its exact sequence-dating, to the extent that this is made possible by the working-hypothesis techniques now available to us.48 The oldest parts of our Bible are some curses or epic fragments, down to and including the presumably Davidic chants and Solomonic reality-listings in the compilations which bear their names. We will note below some rather tenuous grounds for including here Pss 78 and 103 + 4 and Prv 13-17. More assured is the antiquity of Deborah's chant, "Curse Meroz, said mal'ak yhwh, really curse its dwellers."49 Along with this may be considered Jgs 2,1.4, " mal'ak yhwh near Gilgal said, T brought you up from Egypt, 46 Gesenius-Buhl, Handwörterbuch (Berlin: Springer, 171949= 1915) 425, M.-J. Lagrange, "L'ange de Iahvé," RB 12 (1903) 223 emphasizes that mVk in Phoenician means "messenger" ; but he is quite ready to see it as a variant of mlk (king) . 47 Demiurge is defined by Webster: "In Platonic philosophy, the subordinate god who created the world. In some Gnostic systems, an inferior, not absolutely intelligent deity, the creator of the world, identified by some with the creator God of the OT, and distinguished from the supreme God." The OT mal'āk does in fact often seem to be a name of him who is both God and creator; and was often identified as the Lògos (footnote 60 below). 48 As shown by precept and example in (A. Robert-) H. Cazelles, Introduction à la Bible (Paris: Desclée, 1957) 1, 343f. On the drawbacks of a more casual use of this method in de Frame's Adam and even Lys' Nephesh and Ruach, see my CBQ 28 (1966) 499. My own analysis fails (in most cases) to trace and date the origin of the transmitted utterance prior to its fixation in writing (see footnote 58) : partly because no usable consensus is available; and inspired authorship relates proximately to inclusion or re-use in a written composition. 49 W.

Also ancient are the Balaam curse-formulas and their narrative pre- suppositions.50 Precisely the resistance and speech of the donkey are due to mal'ak yhwh ten times repeated in Nm 22,22-35. In verse 22, "the anger of 'elõhim flared, and mal'ak yhwh stood in the road as a satan for him." In verse 23, the donkey saw mal'ak yhwh standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand. To those who have antecedent assurance that Satan is a fallen mal'ak, and that the Cherubim holding drawn swords in [sub- J] Gn 3,24 are mal'ākīm, Jgs 22,22f. seems explicit confirmation. But if we more properly see ourselves here at the very outset of inspired recording of data relevant to angelology, its identification of mal'ak, kerûb, and (fallen) sātan cannot be called obvious. At any rate there are few exegetes today who would not admit that the talking- donkey episode involves a "theological symbolism," expressed to some extent legitimately even if not felicitously by terms like "myth" or "fiction." If a large part of the passage expresses its revealed content by means of creative imagination, it cannot a priori be excluded that this technique extends also to the role assigned to the mal'āk . In verses 28+31, not the mal'ak but yhwh opened the donkey's mouth; also "opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw mal'ak yhwh ." These ex- pressions may be evaluated later in relation to some J and E parallels. Meanwhile in the Balaam story 24,12, as well as in less primitively- imaginative nearby accounts of Israel's passage in East-Jordan 20,14; 21,21, mal'ākīm occur as simple messengers among men. It has been noted that these are regularly in groups, because a human leader cannot trust one alone : at least in the sense that one alone might not suffice to surmount the exertions and dangers of the task. But the mal'ak of God is generally singu- lar. 950 B.C.: Yahwist-Strand Usage The earliest literary fixation of our existing Bible is now commonly linked with the public-relations activities of Solomon in Judah, and with the Pentateuch J-strand. In Gn 16,7.9, mal'ak yhwh encourages Hagar to bear patiently Sarai's bullying. In verse 10 t(mal'ak yhwh says 'I will multiply your descendants' " ; but in verse 1 1 "mal'ak yhwh says ' yhwh has heeded you.' " Thereupon in verse 13 Hagar "gave a name to yhwh who spoke to her," namely, El- Seeing-Me, "for she said, 'Have I really seen 'elõhim and stayed alive ?' " In Gn 22,11 to avert Abraham's slaying Isaac, mal'ak yhwh calls to him so W. F. Albright, "The Oracles of Balaam," JBL 63 (1944) 207-233.

Again in 22,15ff. mal'ak yhwh says, "By myself I have sworn, says yhwh ... I will multiply your descendants."51 Abraham tells his servant that yhwh , the 'elõhím of heaven, will send his mal'ak to help find a wife for Isaac ; and the servant later cites Abraham's words (Gn 24,7.40). This is noteworthy as the first of the rare passages in which the mal'ak yhwh is at all linked with any real "sending" or messenger- functions. But it is equally noteworthy that Abraham's words of pious hope afford no attestation that any mal'ak did in fact intervene or receive such a "sending." In Ex 3,2f. (near Horeb, an E-word), mal'ak yhwh appeared to Moses; when yhwh saw that Moses had turned, he called to him out of the bush. The mal'ak passages about Balaam were noted above as pre-J. Not all would admit the persistence of true J and E strands past the Tetra- teuch into Judges and Kings. Without presuming this (to which we admit feel- ing inclined), we can note in the Gideon and Samson narratives the numerous mal'ak yhwh references interwoven with a rare variant mal'ak 'elõhím, and pro- visionally attribute these to J and E traditions. The English Jerusalem Bible says that in Jgs 6,14.16.23 it is the sacred author himself who identifies yhwh with his mal'āk , while in verse 22 this identification is attributed to Gideon. But Gideon there uses the name "my Lord yhwh " as a call (to someone, i.e., in second person), followed by mal'ak yhwh in third person. Moreover he learns the groundlessness of his fear that he must die, presumably as the fate of those who "look directly on the face of God," whatever that means.52 The apparent casual transit between yhwh and his mal'āk as speaker must be considered as part of a vastly larger problem of why human authors are often careless about their grammatical consistency. But in verse 8 this oscillation embraces also a third subject, an 'is nãbí' or "prophet man," sent by yhwh , not plainly related to or distinct from the mal'ak or thereby yhwh himself.53 Gideon's only mal'ak 'elõhím introduces his subsequent sacrifice. In the Samson annunciation-narrative, the J -mal'ak occurs ten times and 51 Otto Eissfeldt, Hexateuch-Synopse (Leipzig : Hinrichs, 1922) 36, brackets yhwh in all these passages, which he ascribes to the Elohist. 52 Unquestionably a metaphor, it may just as well mean those who "encounter" God, or in some way "experience his presence" in natural catastrophes or in their own opposition to nature's laws. 53 Mal'ak itself is alleged to have the sense of "prophet" in 1 Sm 42,19 ; 44,26 ; Hag 1,3; Mai 3,1 ; 2 Chr 36, 15f. But really in all these it is the name of "messenger" which is applied to a prophet. See footnote 35 above.

The only reason for making this mal'ak theophanic is that after he disappears in flame Samson's father fears to die because he has seen 'Ëlôhîm 13,22. Otherwise the visitor is repeatedly characterized as a man (8.10.11), whom Samson's mother at first finds merely "like" mal'ak ' ëlôhîm . The mďak yhwh, when food is offered to him, says, "Even if I did stay on with you, I would not eat your food; but if you wish to prepare a holocaust, offer it to yhwh (for Manoah did not know that this was mal'ak yhwh)" (13,16). This verse (especially as echoed later in Tb 12,19) is held to warrant regard- ing the angel as an intermediate spirit, no less strongly than verse 22 warrants regarding him as a manifestation of God himself. But really "eating" is a char- acteristic not of corporeity but of animality. A stone does not eat, but it is a body. Light rays and fire and water do not eat, and the angel-nature was by early exegetes variously explained in terms of these, precisely to account for the fact that the angel's nature though subtle was truly material. In any case, the refusal to eat "your" food would hardly be seen as proof of incorporeity apart from antecedent presumptions. Why should even an incorporeal substance not truly eat human food, just as truly as he performs other functions like talking which are purely material and belong to a body which by supposition is not his own? Cannot God himself appearing in a theophany under the form of man truly eat? And if once the angel's possibility of eating be admitted, then his "inability" to do so cannot be taken as proof of his incorporeity. 850 B.C.: Eloihist and JE "Elohim hears" 'ishma'-ēl in Gn 21,17 ; and mal'ak ' ëlôhîm calls to Hagar from heaven " 'Elohim has heard' ... I [ !] will make him a great nation." Apart from various factors which might account for the varying of subject in the last clause, this "angel calling from heaven" seemed to me in a preliminary comparative survey the likeliest of all mal'ak passages to support the notion of a "pure spirit" or at least "superhuman heavenly being." Upon closer scrutiny there seem to be various other suitable inter- pretations too. In Gn 31,11 Jacob narrates a dream in which "mal'ak ' ëlôhîm says to him, 'I am hā-ēl bet-'ēl' Jacob with his hands on Ephraim and Manasseh in Gn 48,16 blesses Joseph and Ephraim: "May 'ëlôhîm, the mal'āk who has saved me from evil, bless the youths." This passage apparently supports the view that 64 Ephraim Speiser, Genesis (W. Albright, Anchor Bible, 1; New York: Double- day, 1964 ) 244, in Gn 31,13 supplies from LXX "hā-'ēl 'who appeared to you in* Beth-El," but adds that Ilu Bayt-Ilu as the name of a god is attested in an Assyrian treaty [AFO Beiheft 9,109/6]. Speiser on Gn 16,7 (p. 118) holds that mal'āk originally meant messenger, "exactly as ángelos " (435)</page><page sequence="18">130 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 29 mal'ak yhwh is in origin an inversion of yhwh mal'āk in the sense of "oracle-giver."55 The mal'akê ' ëlôhîm of Jacob's ladder and of Mahanaim (Gn 28,12; 32,2) are called JE by Briggs, but simply E by Eissfeldt. Briggs seems to class as JE also the Sodom angels of Gn 19,1.5, though Eissfeldt attributes them to a sub- J source.56 To the same sub- J source are due the "sons of ' ëlôhîm , fathering giants by human mothers" in Gn 6,4. This passage repeatedly prevents patristic exegesis from admitting pure spirituality in the angels. No sense other than angel seemed tolerable for a being called "son of god." Today such an equating of these benê ' ëlôhîm with mal'ākīm would be admitted by no exegete: neither those who postulate the pure spirituality of mal'ākīm, nor those for whom mal'āk expresses in some way the beings formerly outside Israel held to be divine, but theologically down- graded to the role of something yhwh sits on. In Ex 14,19, mal'ak 'ëlôhîm goes before Israel in march. According to Couroyer in the Jerusalem Bible, this is repeated in Ex 23,20, the most theologically charged passage of our inquiry.57 "Behold, I send a [Sam G V 'my'] mal'āk before you, to keep you on the road, and to bring you to the place which I have prepared. (21) Be on guard before him, and hear his voice ; do not embitter him, because he will not lift up for your sins, because my name is within him."

But actually we have here no traits of the Catholic belief in guardian angels. The "angel" has no personal-bodyguard function, and there is only one for the whole escaping horde. He is sent to show the road and demand disciplined forward movement. It is not even said that he will avert or protect from any dangers, whether natural or human.

In Nm 20,16, " yhwh sent a mal'āk and [? + he] brought us out of Egypt" : as we have seen, "sent" is not a normal expression ; and the whole "sent a mal'āk " is bracketed by Eissfeldt as an E-insertion in the J context, which twice uses mal'ākīm for ordinary messengers, as in 21,21.

For Lagrange this was often a later interpolation or what we would today call a relecture , to tone down the anthropomorphism of God appearing in person.59 For many Catholics in the wake of the Fathers, the mal'ak was so unmistakably God and yet so unmistakably sent by God that it can be only the Lògos, a view now wholly abandoned.00 For others it has seemed inadmissible that the mal'āk really desig- nates God at all.61 And in fact the abrupt changes of subject, by which the 58 Georg Beer, Exodus (O.

Nevertheless for the more qualified modern exegetes it seems inescapable that the mal'ak yhwh is in some cases an expression for God himself. Yet almost none of the recent experts seem willing to draw the further obvious conclusion that mďak really meant a "presence" or re-present-ation of God, earlier than it meant re-present-ative, or simultaneously. But all this is irrelevant to our search for "separated spiritual substance" in the OT. The theophanic angel is either God himself or it is not. If or when it is God, this fact is known only because it speaks as God, not from any description of its external appearance or activities, or of its nature: it is a superhuman being, but not an angel or messenger at all. If or when the mal'ak yhwh is not God, it is a person, an apparently human person, accompanying a direct communication of God. This is not really a "messenger"-function in any normal sense; though perhaps more tolerably than in calling God "his own messenger." There is no evidence that this quasi- messenger, if not God, is a pure spirit. There is considerable evidence that it is a "heavenly being," but in its activities rather than its nature. Even if the mal'ak yhwh were more plainly "sent" by God than is commonly assumed, or precisely when it is so sent, the "superhuman" power of performing miracles would not of itself imply that the messenger possesses a nature sur- passing the purely human. In many cases where God's agent has already been described as a human being, with family ties and group activities, his perfor- mance of even the most striking miracles is never taken as proving superhuman nature, and almost never as even suggesting that possibility to his associates.62 So we cannot proceed further unless we agree that in the case of a being who performs superhuman feats and is called an angel, we may not utilize in order to determine whether "angel" means "superhuman" the fact that in God's name he performs miracles. To this extent the Briggs division into "messenger" and "angel as messenger of God" does not really face the point at issue. It would have to show a dif- ference in the specific quality of messenger between those who are employed by God and those who are employed by other men. At any rate the mďak yhwh is not normally "sent by God" nor truly a messenger, but an accompaniment or visible form of God's communication. on primitive belief in a "detachable soul," by Adolphe Lods, "L'ange de Yahvé et lMâme extérieure'," BZ AW 27 (Festschrift J.

"Jacob strove with a mal'āk," says Hos 12,5, adapting Gn 32,22, which says rather, "Jacob strove with a man, who blesses him ; then Jacob says, 'I have seen 'elõhím face to face/ " The "angel of the great council" familiar from Vulgate Is 9,6, is a LXX doublet combining, in a proportion which we cannot accurately determine, elements from the adjacent 'ël gibbôr, ' abí ead, sar sãlôm, "divine hero, father of 'yet' [or ? fēd 'counsel'], prince [as Michael in Dn 10,13]." In Is 42,19 and 44,26 it is alleged that mal'āk means "prophet." Doubtless the person to whom it is applied is in fact a nãbí'. But the term "messenger" applied to him is as noncommittal as in 14,32; 18,2; 30,4; 37,9.14; and 33,7. In sum, at the side of the earliest book-prophets' few uses of mal'āk as messenger, we have some highly significant relectures bibliques whereby the name mal'āk is given to a marvelous divine being whose activity had been described in the Bible under other names. 640 B.C.: Deuteronomist- Jeremiah School The book of Deuteronomy, like P, ignores the mal'ak yhwh, though Dt 2,26 once uses mal'āk for an ordinary messenger between men. The passage is perhaps echoed in Jeremiah's sole use, 27,3. Contemporary Na 2,14 refers to human messengers in a negative symbol. "Sons of Israel" in the Masoretic Dt 32,8, given as benê ' ēlīm in a Qumrân fragment confirming the Septuagint-Syriac-Vulgate "national boundaries according to the number of angels of God" is seen as having given rise (along with Dn 10,13) to the belief in guardian angels, at least of nations.68 There is good reason for refusing to admit any traceable Deuteronomic redaction in Genesis through Numbers. We cannot ignore Noth's claim to find it in Ex 23,23 and 33,2, "My mal'āk will go before you, and he will bring you to the Amorite-Hittite-Perizzite-Canaanite-Hivite-Jebusite, and I will destroy him" ; "I will send a mal'āk before you, and drive out the 63 Bousset-Gressmann (as in footnote 66) p. 324.

The history recognized since Noth as deuteronomistic, apart from the plausibly Yah wist or Elohist traditions noticed above, uses mal'ak as men's messenger 9 times in Judges and 52 times in Samuel-Kings. The really unique feature of Samuel usage is the four passages in which the king, as a sort of protocol compliment, is compared to mal'ak yhwh precisely for wisdom, though it is David, not Solomon.65 In Second Kings there are two interventions of mal'ak yhwh, to tell Elijah about Ahaziah consulting Beelzebub, and to order him to accompany the king's captain without fear, 1,3.15; verses 3 and 16 also use mal'āk pejoratively of messengers sent to consult Beelzebub. In First Kings the uses are more peculiar : an Old Prophet says to a Man of God "A mal'āk spoke to me by the word of yhwh" 13,18; and a mal'āk touched Elijah and said "Eat," 19,5. Rightly regarded as a class apart is the Exterminating Angel. The one who killed 185,000 Assyrians (give or take a few zeroes) is called only mal'ak yhwh in 2 Kgs 19,35 = 2 Chr 32,21 = Is 37,36 (= 2 Mc 15,22), and is subject to the same likelihood as elsewhere that mal'āk means "repre- sentation." Ha-mal'āk ha-mashît occurs in 2 Sm 24,16, while in that verse and the next mal'āk alone is also used to describe the same agent of Goďs anger against David's census. We must notice here what is made of this mal'āk by the Chronicler, though at a later date. 1 Chr 21,12 blames David's act on a satan, whereas 2 Sm 24,1 has it instigated by yhwh in his anger. 1 Chr 21,12 allows David to choose mal'ak yhwh mas hit, not as an agent of the plague but as an alternative to either "plague on earth" or "sword of yhwh ." In verse 15, he is once called just mal'āk sent by 'elõhim ; and twice, as stopped by yhwh , called mal'āk mašhit and mal'ak yhwh: variations which we may ascribe to an indifference or theological insensitivity ad- mittedly rare in the Chronicler. In verse 16 David sees (this) mal'ak yhwh standing between earth and heaven with an unsheathed sword in hand: this is a made-to-order description for those who have antecedent assurance that mal'āk means a "heavenly" being, "intermediate between God and man," and identical with the Cherub of Gn 3,24; but truly 1 Chr 21,16 asserts nothing whatever about the "nature" of the mal'āk .

Nevertheless in verse 30 David is prevented from consulting 'elõhím at Gibeon solely by his fear of the sword of mal'ak yhwh ! Returning from our Chronicles digression, we note that the deuteronomist school uses mal'āk 77 times, more than a third of the total, including 64 times as "messenger." The 13 mal'ak yhwh uses all fall into new and special categories : the Exterminator ; the doubtfully-deuteronomic tribe list mal'āk; a comparison signifying regal wisdom ; and a prophet guide along- side pejorative mal'ak. 550 B.C.: Ezekiel, Second Isaiah; ?Psalms Mal'āk as messenger occurs in Ez 17,15; 23,16.40; and 30,9. "Real angels" have been alleged by Gressmann in the executioners of 9,2 (not mashit) and the surveyor of 40,3, and by van Imschoot in the scribe of 9,2 : though all these are called "men" and not mal'ak** The Holiness-Code related to Ezekiel, like the whole of P, contains no example of mal'āk, though 'elõhím reprehensibly cursed in Lv 24,15 has been implausibly rendered as "guardian angel."67 Second-Isaiah's "angel of the face" (63,9) is, as noted by McKenzie, one of our strongest warrants for taking mal'āk as "appearance." On 42,19; 44,26, see "prophet" under First Isaiah above. The Psalter, like the OT itself, is a collection of writings dating over the full 800 years.68 Its eight verses involving mal'āk find apparently no firm 66 P. van Imschoot, Théologie de V Ancien Testament (Paris: Desclée, 1954) 1, 123. On page 126 apropos of Jb 38,7, "sons of elohim and stars" he says that the Hebrews seem to have reduced the stars from their Babylonian role of divinities to mal'ākīm or messengers of God, as the cherubim too were assigned new roles (p. 129). These views seem traceable to W. Bousset, H. Gressmann, Die Religion des Judentums im späthellenistischen Zeitalter (Tübingen: Mohr, 31926) 320; page 322 claims that in the wake of Babylon angels are equated with stars in Jb 1,6 ; 2,1 ; 38,7 ; 1 Kgs 22,19 ; Pss 29,1; 82,1; 89,6ff. The relation of this to Ezekiel is apparently echoed in J. N. Schofield, "Angel," in Alan Richardson's Theological Word Book of the Bible (London: SCM, 1950) 18, "Later Jewish thought (Ezek 40:3) regarded angels as intermediaries between man and God"; earlier "our clear-cut distinction between natural and supernatural did not exist" and yet "there was a belief that there was a rich background of supernatural [ !] beings attendant on God." 67 S. Landersdorfer, "Zur Lehre von den Schutzengeln im AT," Katholik 98 (1918) 114-120. 68 No one has ever had the courage to publish a Psalter consistently chronological by verses, though every biblical theologian who cites any one verse must have in his own mind some presumption as to when that verse was written, and/or when it was inserted with the same words understood in slightly altered sense: Joachim Becker, (441)</page><page sequence="24">136 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 29 defender of pre-exilic date. There is greatest evidence of antiquity for the "messenger" uses. But these are by no means ordinary messengers. They are "messengers of evil," thus perhaps forerunners of the mashìt, in 78,49, one of the Asaph-psalms with very early but also late-P links.69 In Ps 104,4 occurs the famous dogma proof text, "God makes his angels spirits." Despite its influence in developing scholastic angelology, this verse seems to say " yhwh makes his mal'āktm into winds," or as more commonly taken, "makes storms his messengers." Influence of Akhenaten and other Egyptian Creator-hymns seems undoubted in this Psalm, and it also echoes Egyptian "reality-list scholarship."70 It seems to be a part or twin of Ps 103, whose verse 20 is "bless yhwh, you his mal'āktm, and you gibbôrê kôah doing his word." The mal'ak yhwh who in 35, Sf. drives enemies like chaff and pursues along a dark slippery way, is framed in a rīb tribunal scene amid purely metaphorical military terminology; very late dating is favored.71 The momentous 91,11, "he has put his mal'āktm in charge of you to guard you in all your ways," comes from an undatable pilgrimage-psalm. Postexilic and perhaps even dependent on deuterocanonical Dn 3,58 is Ps 148,2, "praise him, all his mal'āktm ; praise him, all his sebã'[ôt: corrupt ending]." Finally "mal'ak yhwh encamping around those who fear him" occurs in Ps 34,8 in an acrostic pattern, presumably therefore very late but thought by Kraus possibly added in reediting an earlier chant. Subject to cautions about their date, the Psalm references are of importance chiefly as reflecting a primeval world-view in which nature-forces like stars and storms once thought divine are degraded to the role of yhwh's "seat" on chariot or Ark-lid cherub.72 Israel deutet seine Psalmen : Urform und Neuinterpretation (Stuttgart: Bibelstudien 18, 1966) 21. «o "Pre-Davidic" : H.-J.

While Haggai uses mal'āk only once, as "messenger" 1,13, and the Zerubbabel memoir Ezra 1-6 never, there are no fewer than nineteen exactly datable occurrences in Proto-Zechariah.73 All are in visions; and apart from this all are devoid of theological impact. 440 B.C.: Malachi; Nehemiah; ?Job; ?Proverbs The covenant-ma/'ā&amp; in Mai 3,1 is a self-contained enigma; the cult- prophet is mal'ak yhwh in Mai 2,7. The Malachi-related Deutero-Zechariah 12,8 retrieves the thread of 2 Sm 14,17, "the house of David shall be like ' ëlôhîm , like mal'ak yhwh " Nehemiah (6,3) from the wall sends "messengers" to decline an inter- view with Sanballat. Under Ezra the P-strand of the Pentateuch doubtless took its final form.74 It contains no example of mal'äk in any sense. This must imply some repugnance in so sensitive a theologian. Yet this is pre- cisely the era in which angels were allowed to become popular within divine revelation because allegedly they no longer contributed to the polytheist threat.75 The "angel exegete,, of Jb 33,23 holds out a fascinating promise which is sans lendemain. "Even in [such superior beings as] mal'ākīm God finds flaws," Jb 4,18 seems to imply. Seven other occurrences of ángelos in the LXX are unrepresented in the Hebrew, and Gregory draws two more into the angel-purview.76 (Leipzig: Hegner, 1935) 1, 142, shows that in the Bible the heavenly beings are wholly in the service of God, and therefore that they are not "autonomous" nature-forces ; he speaks of "the revealed concept of a pure spirit" though under a name which is wholly functional. 73 Zech 1,9.11.12.13.14.19; 2,3.3; 3,1.3.4.5.6; 4,1.4.5; 5,5.10; 6,4.

Chronicle; ?Qohelet Six ordinary messengers of men are called mal'āk in 1 Chr 14,1 ; 19,2.16; 2 Chr 18,12; 35,21. This makes a notably small percentage of the occur- rences in Sm-Kgs. God's prophets are called mal'āk twice in 2 Chr 36,15f. We analyzed the ten occurrences of the Exterminator in C-parallels. The Chronicler is dated by some around 400, by others around 200 : both point to valid factors which warrant maintaining successive redactions. Qohelet is certainly a reaction to the Greek cultural invasion after 300 ; it may well be as late as 150. In 5,6 the mal'āk before whom the validity of a vow should not be denied seems a heavenly warning of some kind (GS "God") rather than merely the messenger sent to collect. 165 B.C.: Daniel, Tobit, Maccabees It is convenient that all deuterocanonical uses of ángelos fall here to- gether. Strangely, mal'āk never occurs in Masoretic Daniel; Michael is "prince" in 10,13; 12,1; Gabriel is "a man" in 9,21; "virile-looking" in 8,15f. The one million and the one hundred million serving the Ancient of Days (7,10) are seen in night-visions and not called mal'āk ; though doubtless they form the "court of heavenly beings" vaguely presumed in many uses of mal'āk elsewhere.78 Geister and Dämonen. Paul Volz, Die Eschatologie der jüdischen Gemeinde im neu- testamentlichen Zeitalter (Tübingen: Mohr, 1934 = Hildesheim: Olms, 1966) on p. 86 treats Satan, and on p. 118 the soul, both briefly and in no apparent relation to angels; see also his Das Dämonische in Jahwe (Tübingen, 1924) ; Heinrich Kaupel, Die Dämonen im AT (Augsburg: Filser, 1930) ; L.

"Watcher" seems to be in some few other places a synonym for maVāk. But qaddîs is certainly not "strength." It serves to recall a veritable hurricane of recent expert contentions that the "Holy Ones of the Most High" in Dn 7,18 mean angels rather than "the saints come marching in."80 There is a paraphrase or doublet of Dn 4,20 in LXX 21, "the Most High and the ángeloi will run down against you." Similarly in verse 29, "the ángeloi will pursue you seven years" is part of the lengthy expansion of Aramaic verse 25, "seven times shall pass over you." And the verse called 30c (really 32), "an angel called to me from heaven," is the happy ending of a doublet putting into Nebuchadnezzar's own speech of verse 34 what Aramaic 33 records in third person. In the three deuterocanonical supplements to Daniel, ángelos occurs ten times. It is the ángelos kyríou in the furnace 3,49.58; helping Susan 13,44 (twice) ; 13,55.59.62; bringing Habakkuk to Babylon 14,34.36.39; Habakkuk in verse 35 seems to speak to the ángelos as " kyrie ho theós " ! Though the intertestamental pseudepigrapha lie beyond our scope, we may note the importance assigned to them, and to Persian and Greek culture- influences, in developing angelic speculation out of Daniel. Kittel sees the OT tradition (set forth for him by von Rad) as developing in three main lines: oriental and Persian dualism especially of the Essenes ; Greek rationalism down- grading the angels, probably less current among the Sadducees than is at- tributed to them; and the Rabbinic angels, "always a naive representation of the omnipresent and omniscient Word and Will of Yahweh . . . simply intro- duced to give color to the OT stories, and never tending to become rival divinities as in neighbor religions."81 79 Louis F.

The name means "God's medicine," and he provides wonder-drugs, both for Tobias's blind father (6,8; 11,11), and against the demon Asmodeus (3,8; 6,16). While young Tobias waits, conveniently distracted by his de-demoned bride, Raphael pursues Asmodeus the two thousand miles to Upper Egypt and "binds" him there. Eventually Raphael reveals himself as "one of the [ !] seven angels who present the prayers of the saints and enter into the presence of the glory of the Lord . . . who all these days merely appeared to eat and drink" (12,15.19). "The seven," otherwise unattested in the Bible regarding mal'ākim , is a pre- cious indication that the Scripture is referring here not to a doctrine revealed either now for the first time or already in the Bible, but presumed from some other existing body of information. No real indication of dependence on Persian Amesha-Spentas may be seen just in the number seven.82 It is indeed significant that an interest in the angels and their activities is more conspicuous within Judaism and even within the Bible after contact with Persia. But though Zoroastrianism had notions of "spirituality" and "heaven" more like our own than like the prior Old Testament's, we will perhaps deem the matter less rele- vant after we have evaluated what exactly the postexilic Scripture asserts about the angels as incorporeal. We may grant that the fact of merely appearing to eat and drink is taken by the sacred author to exclude conclusively, not indeed corporeity, but bodily hu- manity. The Vulgate renditions imply that Raphael did in fact have some kind of food and drink, presumably needed for his (bodily) sustenance, though not visible to "ordinary men." But we must ask how much the sacred writer takes for granted, without asserting inerrantly, in his angelology. The adventures and the very existence of Asmodeus are readily dismissed as a bit of local color to brighten the narrative, even by Catholic commentators who regard the sur- E.

To say these books are "pure fiction" needlessly offends those who feel that there is no place for deception or entertainment in inspired Scripture. Parable of course and allegory are legitimate vehicles of God's revelation: yet it is hard to see how the "apparently historical details" which these genres employ can be distinguished from "pure fiction" other than by their finality. At any rate the presence of some genuinely historical elements is no disproof of "pure fiction." Use of genuine occurrences in the so-called historical novels differs only in degree from such use in the wildest Alice-in- Wonderland fancy fiction. All fiction draws upon a large fund of experiences familiar to its readers, but combines them in ways not historically verified. At least the main purpose of Tobit is theological instruction. Some at least of the apparently-historical details are purely imaginative flourishes. They were borrowed from a background in which they were widely "believed" : not exactly held to be "historical," but held to pertain to that fund of lore which it is not well to question too daringly. Indeed, it can hardly be doubted that the sacred writer also " believed " them in this sense, just as he believed that heaven is up and that the sun moves around the earth. But he did not affirm these things. In any parable, the reader must beware of formulating too categorically just what the writer did "affirm." Sometimes the parables even of Jesus are aimed more at raising problems than at solving them. "The strange and trustworthy workings of God's providence" is a theme worthy of a sacred book. But if that was the theme of Tobit, it is hard to see that what is asserted of Raphael, or specifically of his "not eating" and "being one of The Seven," can confidently be assigned a degree of "historicity" eclipsing that of Asmodeus and Ahiqar. Judith uses ángelos only of ordinary messengers, 1,11 ; 3,1 ; the Vulgate custodivit me angelus 13,20 is not in LXX, Syriac, or Itala.85 Esther (5,2 RSV, called also 15,16 or D:13) says she regards the pagan king as ángelos theoû. In the soberly factual First Maccabees, ángelos occurs only as a messen- ger from one man to another (1,44; 5,14; 7,10.41). In the theologically- glamorized Second Maccabees, ángelos refers only to a miracle-working divine envoy (11,6; 15,22f.), though with no implication of immateriality.86 88 Luis Arnaldich, Biblia Comentada (Madrid: BAC, 1961) 2, 785. 84 In the widely-diffused ancient fable which has survived in Aramaic, Ahiqar is an Assyrian official. In the Vatican codex of Tb 1,21 he is a relative of Tobias; also 11,17; 14,10; see R. Charles, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha (Oxford, 1963) 2, 717. 85 J.-B.

Heidt, Angelology of the OT (Washington: Catholic U., 1949) 25, to be angels (see footnote 44 above) : "For the Oriental, angels were real beings; it sufficed to speak of them in human terms ... if upon leaving [the celestial visitor] simply vanished into thin air, that fact would not imply primarily his incorporeity but merely (447)</page><page sequence="30">142 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 29 In the words by which a Catholic scholar concludes a recent research not unlike our own, "The convinced Christian will today hold fast to belief in the Angels in the sense of the Bible and the Church, but with an awareness that the biblical declarations must be understood and evaluated on the basis of their background as here set forth."87 Conclusions (1) "Angel" in translations of the OT cannot be antecedently presumed to mean what it means today, "separated spiritual substance" or "heavenly being intermediate in nature between God and man." It is not called "spirit" in the OT, even in Ps 104,4. (2) It is wrong to expect from the OT direct information about concepts foreign to it like "nature" or "pure spirit." But "the spiritual" is basic to the religion and theology which has developed out of the OT. Hence it is indis- pensable to probe the extent to which this is already conveyed within the OT itself. (3) Whatever modern theology has to say about angels was always con- sciously attached to the term normally rendering OT mal'āk . The rendition had an independent prior existence in Greek in the sense of "messenger," not necessarily without religious nuances. Earliest Scripture already uses maVãkím as "groups of messengers among men," but oftener mal'āk in a sense for which "messenger" is palpably inadequate. (4) The earlier OT focuses mal'āk as bearer of God's word, representing him but not "sent" by him. Later and deuterocanonical portions see the mal'āk as performing special superhuman actions by the power of, but at a distance from, God. The support which these later writings give to "superhuman spiritual nature" must be appraised in the light of their genre and of "the miraculous." (5) The mal'āk undoubtedly speaks "from heaven" (Gn 21,17; 22,11), or is otherwise suggested to be part of the "heavenly court" frequent in the OT but not under the name of mal'ākīm. But a "heavenly being" may mean like ben 'elõhim or 'ēl gibbôr an unusual being, by special divine influence possessing powers beyond normal human nature, but with no judgment about the nature itself. (6) The mal'āk who seems to speak as God himself either really is God or is a being distinct from God. If it is God, it gives no information about the nature of an angel. But it may show that mal'āk means representation, as a "presence" or manner of rendering oneself present, rather than the specific form of this representative which is messenger. If the mal'āk is not God, then it leaves be further evidence of his heavenly mission." P. 109 discredits Iranian influence on OT angels. 87 J. Michl, "Engel," in H.

(7) The angel's refusal to eat (Jgs 13,16; Tb 12, 19) does not prove that it is incorporeal, because other material objects also do not eat. Nor does it prove superhuman nature, which presumably could perform various human actions by God's power. It proves that for the sacred writer the messenger is not just an ordinary man, but specially related to a divine sphere concerning which the information in his background is not quite coherent on the role of stars and displaced deities. (8) Names like "Prince Michael," "sons of God," and "cherubim" in general express beings more pronouncedly material or sexual than mal'āk itself. But in any case, OT exegesis cannot equate these with the word rendered "angel" unless that equating is set forth within the OT: normally, though not indis- pensably, by a passage in which the word mal'āk occurs. (9) Satan and demon also are names which must be proved within Scripture itself to be equated with "(fallen) angel" before conclusions can be drawn re- garding the nature of an angel in itself. The undoubted relevance of Ap 12,9; 20,2 requires careful evaluation of that book's use of symbol and implicit cita- tion, and lies beyond the scope of an OT inquiry. (10) Not only the latest but the earliest (Balaam, Tobit) references support- ing superhuman nature of mal'āk occur within narratives universally admitted to contain "apparently historical" items fabricated or borrowed from pagan mythology to express a more generic theological truth. We cannot claim for the angels in these narratives a degree of objective reality which we deny to adjacent elements, without presuming these angels' existence and nature to be independently known. (11) Alleged Persian or Greek influence in spiritualizing the concept of mal'āk in postexilic books, though worthy of a serious separate inquiry, leaves unexplained why even these deuterocanonica have less kinship with the pagan angelologies than do postbiblical Christianity and Judaism. (12) Conclusions of a restrictedly OT inquiry like this must perforce remain "open-ended" insofar as the whole subsequent theologies of Judaism and Christianity legitimately pertain to the history of exegesis of the passages in question. But our title was justified insofar as any theology of the angel, for those to whom it is defined "separated spiritual substance," must begin as it always has begun with the OT data.
