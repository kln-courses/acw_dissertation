<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN INTERPRETATION OF POE'S "AL AARAAF" By Floyd Stovall Al Aaraaf is a notoriously obscure poem, but it is not, as some have supposed, unintelligible. It was certainly never intended by its author as a hoax.1 On the contrary, it was a serious and ambitious attempt to produce a great poem. Its obscurity is partly due to imperfections of style. Frag mentary and rambling sentences, ambiguous punctuation, confusion of images, inadequate transitions, and seemingly irrelevant parentheses and allusions conspire to perplex the unwary reader. But imperfections of style obscure only the details. More serious are the defects in structure, because they obscure the whole conception of the poem. Unless sus tained by patience and determination, therefore, the reader may conclude that Poe was not master of his own thoughts? that, literally, he did not know what he was talking about. Such a conclusion, however, if not altogether false, would surely be unjust. Al Aaraaf is not a masterpiece, to be sure, but rather a potpourri of undigested materials and purposes that converge to no focus; yet it requires no clairvoyance to discern, running through it in shadowy out line, the purposive vision projected uncertainly from the poet's mind. Some of the difficulties of style have been eliminated by the diligence and insight of editors and other commentators. What remains to be explained is not of vital importance to the essential meaning of the poem. I do not intend here to deal specifically with such matters, believing, as I do, that the chief problem yet unsolved is one of structure. The primary aim of this paper, then, is to rediscover, as far as possible, the underlying plan or pattern of the poem, reduce this plan to its structural elements, and then analyze and 1Professor Charles W. Kent suggests the possibility that the poem was not meant to be understood. A brief review of opinions is given by Professor Killis Campbell in his edition of Poe's poems, p. 173.

The underlying plan of Al Aaraaf might be illustrated by a chart of the stellar universe, with three slight modifica tions: increasing the relative size of the Earth, adding a prominent star the movements of which are independent of the law of gravity, and localizing God and Heaven in the region without and above this material universe, visible but unapproachable. Through the added star, which is Al Aaraaf, rays of influence flow from God to all parts of the cosmos. The poem is thus a representation, mainly pic torial, of the relation of God to the whole universe, but to the inhabitants of Earth and Al Aaraaf in particular, ex pressed in terms of power and beauty. Professor Campbell has noted that its central idea is "the divineness of beauty."2 Professor Woodberry thinks Poe's purpose was to show that "beauty is the direct revelation of the divine to mankind, and the protection of the soul against sin."3 Similarly, Professor fimile Lauvriere finds in the poem the doctrine of "la Beaute suffisant &amp; I'homme pour Vedairer et le sauver."4 These interpretations, though excellent so far as they go, take no account of the fact, clearly revealed in the poem, that God sometimes manifests His deity in a show of power.6 In its emphasis upon God's rule by power, and in many other ways, Al Aaraaf is not unlike Paradise Lost;6 it is different, however, in being descriptive and fanciful, whereas Milton's poem is in quality dramatic and realistic. Three separate threads, constituting the three structural elements of the poem, are confusedly interwoven to form this general pattern. Each element has its own theme or motif, separately conceived apparently, which the poet has 2Poe's Poems, p. 173. zIAfe of Poe, I, pp. 61-62. 4Edgar Poe, sa vie et son oeuvre, p. 333. 6Power is a form of beauty, too, but terrible rather than fair.

The poem fails to impress the reader with the effect of totality because he loses his way where the threads cross, and finds himself in a maze with no definite goal in sight. Once having dis covered its separate themes and elements, however, and dis entangled its threads of thought, broken in places yet gen erally traceable, we shall find Al Aaraaf not only more in telligible than before, but more significant in the aesthetic development of its author. I The first structural element has a religious motif, being concerned with man in his relation to the authority of God, particularly as that authority is manifested in the fulfill ment of Biblical prophecy. It also has a secondary as tronomical motif designed to explain prophecy in terms of observed phenomena, thus supplementing the religious motif. As conceived in this part of the poem Al Aaraaf is a material star that becomes the instrument of God in the destruction of the world. This religious-astronomical motif, if we may think of the two as one, had its origin in a curious interest in Biblical prophecy. The existence of God Poe never doubted, and he always believed in a life of the spirit in some form after death; but he despaired of ever understanding either by the processes of mere thought.7 He was the more inclined, therefore, to have recourse, as he frequently did, to the imagination. He was an eager, if desultory, student of astronomy, being especially interested in such romantic problems as the existence of intelligent beings in other worlds than ours, or the possible collision of Earth with one of the heavenly spheres. Poe was willing to believe, with some reservations, that the events foretold in the 7Marginalia, in the Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe, edited by James A. Harrison, XVI, p. 135. All references to Poe's prose are to this edition.</page><page sequence="4">An Interpretation of Poe's "Al Aaraaf" 109 Bible would occur literally as described.8 Such a catas trophe, therefore, accomplishing the destruction of the world, might easily appear to him to be the expression of the Divine Will. But he held nature to be the outward expression of the law of God, single and infallible, yet pro viding for every possible contingency.9 How, then, it may be asked, did he reconcile the wandering star with the law of gravity? Though he did not inform us, we may be sure that he could have done so by that specious mode of reason ing, doubtless sincere, to establish a favorite theory, in which subsequently, as in Eureka, he demonstrated his skill. It is unnecessary to explain Poe's interest in the theory of the destruction of the world by collision with a star or a comet, for men have speculated upon that question for cen turies. But his interest was quickened by his having some where in his early reading come across an account of the "new star" discovered by Tycho Brahe in the sixteenth century.10 In a footnote on the title of his poem Poe makes the following statement: "A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which burst forth, in a moment, with a splendor sur passing that of Jupiter?then gradually faded away and became invisible." In the edition of 1845 the note was changed to read: "A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appeared suddenly in the heavens?attained, in a few days, a brilliancy surpassing that of Jupiter?then as sud denly disappeared, and has never been seen since." Both statements are exaggerated. Tycho first saw the star November 11, 1572, when it was as bright as Venus. In December it began to grow fainter, but did not disappear 8See the review of Stephens' Arabia Petraea (New York Review, October, 1837), Poe's Works, X, p. 9; see also the review of Duncan's Sacred Philosophy of the Seasons (Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, March, 1840), Poe's Works, X, pp. 81 ff. ^Eureka, Poe's Works, XVI, pp. 254-255. 10He might have read of Tycho's star in some odd corner of a news paper, or else he might have come across the story in some book about the more famous Kepler, who was a friend and disciple of Tycho.</page><page sequence="5">110 Studies in English altogether until sixteen months subsequent to its first ap pearance.11 The star appeared not to move in the heavens; hence Tycho declared it to be a fixed star, in the eighth sphere.12 In a note on Al Aaraaf in his recent edition of the poems of Poe, Professor Mabbott suggests that the star of the poem is really a comet. That may be true; and yet Poe could not have derived such an idea from Tycho himself, who stoutly maintained that it could not be a comet because it had neither the appearance nor the motion of a comet.18 As an astrologer, Tycho predicted dire disaster following the appearance of this strange star. A similar star was said to have appeared at the time of Hipparchus, about 125 B.C., with terrible consequences. As the star of Bethlehem foretold the birth of Christ, it was generally supposed that the new star heralded his second coming and the end of the world.14 I see no reason for supposing that Poe thought of Al Aaraaf as a comet, since he everywhere refers to it as a star; nevertheless, it may be of interest to introduce here from Poe's later writings an account of what he imagined would happen if the Earth should pass through the tenuous substance of a comet. There would be an unnatural excess of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, the consequence of which must be immediate and omniprevalent combustion. He describes this event as one having experienced it: For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then?let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God!?then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of Him; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.15 ^Dreyer, J. L. E.: Tycho Brahe, Edinburgh, 1890, pp. 41-42. The star seems to have been noticed by others four or five days earlier. 12Ibid., p. 48.

Concerning these prophecies he remarks: We believe there are few intelligent men of the present day? few, either laymen or divines?who are still willing to think that the prophecies here referred to have any further allusion than to the orb of the earth, or, more strictly, to the crust of this orb alone.17 Poe's account of the end of the world, therefore, tallies per fectly with the Biblical prophecy as he interpreted it. Poe also believed in the promise of the millennium after the passing of the old world: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea."18 After its "purification" by fire, the Earth, he imagines, will "clothe itself anew in the verdure and the mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at length a fit dwelling-place for man:?for man the Death-purged?for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more?for the redeemed, regenerated, bliss ful, and now immortal, but still for the material, man."19 These examples of Poe's subsequent speculations on the predicted destruction of the world throw some light upon the obscure allusions in Al Aaraaf.

This mission, though not explicitly stated, is implied in various ways. God is beautiful, of course, because He is harmony, self-consistency; but His beauty has two aspects, the terrible and the fair.23 His power is terrible. We are informed that "the stars trembled at the Deity," and that the angel Nesace hid her face among lilies to escape the fervor of His eye.24 Al Aaraaf has made this visit to Earth by His direction ("Beneath thy burning eye") ;25 it is not strange, therefore, that our world trembled at its approach like "Beauty's bust beneath man's eye."26 Angelo, a Greek, was living on Earth at the time of Al Aaraaf's approach, dying at sunset before the fateful night. He remembered how strangely the light affected him that evening: The sun-ray dropp'd, in Lemnos, with a spell On th* Arabesque carving of a gilded hall Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall?

Sprang from her station, on the winds apart, And rolPd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.28 Except for poetic exaggeration, this passage parallels the one already quoted from the Conversation of Eiros and Charmion. The world was not literally hurled into chaos, because Angelo and Ianthe are gazing upon its light from Al Aaraaf at the moment he is speaking.29 Significant, and yet puzzling, are the last two lines of Angelo's account of the world's end: Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth, A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.30 Al Aaraaf was a "dread star" because of its mission of destruction. Its coming "amid a night of mirth" was in fulfilment of another Biblical prophecy: And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot: they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is re vealed.31 The phrase "red Daedalion" is ambiguous. The adjective implies destructiveness; Mars, for example, gives off a red light. The astrologers of Tycho Brahe's time read disaster in the red light of the new star.32 The noun, evidently derived from "Daedalus," was chosen, I suppose, to suggest the transforming power of Al Aaraaf, as seen in the mar velous change produced on Earth by its coming. One may ask why man and his world should be destroyed. The poem answers the question fully, and in the same way 28J6id., II, 234-236. 29/6id\, II, 194-197.

God created man in His own image, but He formed him out of the dust of the Earth, and He withheld from him knowledge, which is of Heaven. Knowledge is bad for man because his intel lect is incapable of mastering it; misused, it works con fusion. The desire for knowledge on the part of our first parents brought sin into the world "and all our woe," and that sin requires expiation. In the Millennium, after the world has been purified by fire, knowledge will no longer be poison to man's intellect.33 According to Al Aaraaf man has sinned in three principal ways: (1) by misconceiving the true nature of God, (2) by perverting His love, and (3) by misunderstanding the means of His communication with His creatures. We know, says Nesace, that God exists, and we feel that He is eternal, but His true nature has never been revealed.34 Yet some of His creatures (men, of course), seeking truth by reason alone, have come to the false conclusion that God is a Being like themselves? Have dreamed for thy Infinity A model of their own.35 Thus the divine is debased to the level of the human, and man is led astray in his search for God.36 The second sin, the perversion of God's love on Earth ("where all my love is folly"37), is not as clearly defined as the first. It may mean, on the one hand, that men hold love lightly, whereas it should be the guiding principle of their lives, or, on the 33See the passages quoted above, pp. 110 and 111, from the Con versation of Eiros and Charmion and the Colloquy of Monos and Una.

Poefs Works, XI, p. 21. The authorities on anthropomorphism quoted in the note to AI Aaraaf are also quoted here. ^Al Aaraaf, I, 135.</page><page sequence="10">An Interpretation of Poe's "Al Aaraaff 115 other, that God's love is wasted upon the human race be cause they have refused to obey the laws of life that love has dictated; it very probably means both.38 The third sin, as God informs Nesace, is the misunderstanding of His way of revealing Himself? and the crowd Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud, The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean wrath (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?).39 The implication is that men have erred in interpreting God solely by the phenomena of nature, which are inadequate. We are left to deduce the conclusion that God may better be known through the exaltation of the soul. The line in parenthesis seems to contain a threat. The words "angrier path" doubtless refer back to the last lines of the preceding stanza, where God's voice is contrasted with the voice of nature and of the merely ideal: A sound of silence on the startled ear Which dreamy poets name "the music of the sphere." Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call "Silence"?which is the merest word of all. All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings? But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high The eternal voice of God is passing by; And the red winds are withering in the sky!40 The terrible effect of silence was a favorite theme of Poe's. In Silence?A Fable he reveals the fact that of all terrors by which the courage of man may be tried, silence alone is unendurable. He is there thinking apparently of the silence of the tomb. In Sonnet?Silence, however, he hints at a silence more awful than that of the tomb?the silence of total annihilation, or the death of the soul. This silence may be referred to in the threat of an "angrier path" quoted above. 38For further discussion of love, see below.

To Nesace and her subordinates God commits the charge of bearing His secrets through "the upper Heaven," endowing her for this purpose with something of His own resplendency. This time she is to leave her star at its anchorage. Through the new "light" she brings, with its revelation of more of the pure knowledge of Heaven, it is hoped that she may save these beings of other worlds from the guilt of man, and so from his condign punishment.41 II The second structural element is built about the concep tion of Al Aaraaf as an Eden. I adopt the word Eden for lack of a more specific term to denote that abode for which Poe sometimes longed, where, apart from the passions of the heart and the excitements of the mind, the weary spirit may find rest in an eternity of dreams. The term seems the more appropriate because Poe employed it frequently, and because, unlike the word Paradise, it does not exclude the idea of "Lethean peace," which is associated with that abode. Among the spirits of Al Aaraaf, which in the development of the second motif Poe describes as an immaterial world, Nesace, the queen, and Ligeia, her handmaiden, are of a superior order. Like the angels of Heaven they seem to be spirits of original creation, never having had a physical existence. Only two others are specifically named, Angelo, a spirit from Earth, and Ianthe, a spirit coming presumably from one of the numerous worlds to which Nesace and her followers are commanded to bear the secrets of Heaven.42 Among the "thousand seraphs"?which may mean many ^Al Aaraaf, I, 141-150. 42Most scholars, I believe, differ with me on this point. Professoi Campbell says, in his note to II, 178: "Ianthe, apparently, was native to Al Aaraaf." Poe's Poems, p. 190.</page><page sequence="12">An Interpretation of Poe's "Al Aaraaf" 117 thousands?there are doubtless spirits whose material ex istences belonged to widely different worlds ;43 yet they all, like Angelo, arrive on Al Aaraaf through the common gate way of death,44 and belong, like him, to an order inferior to Nesace and Ligeia. In addition to these higher intelligences, there exist also on Al Aaraaf such immaterial things as fairy flowers and the spiritual essences of objects that have their material existence elsewhere. We find there, for example, a fairy flower that drives bees mad, the gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd? Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd All other loveliness;45 there, also, is that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth? And died, ere scarce exalted into birth, Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king.46 These and other "fair flowers and fairy" have the function of bearing Nesace's song in odors up to Heaven.47 Nesace's palace itself, with its "dome by linked light from Heaven let down,"48 seems rather a spiritual emanation than a ma terial edifice.49 About its pillars and cornices seraphs have seen The dimness of this world: that greyish green That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave.50 43In Eureka (1848), he calls mankind "a member of the cosmical family of Intelligences."

In many re spects the one is the exact antithesis of the other. Concern ing al Araf the Koran says in Chapter VII, entitled Al Araf: And between the blessed and the damned there shall be a veil; and men shall stand on al Araf, who shall know every one of them by their marks; and shall call unto the inhabitants of paradise, saying, Peace be upon you: yet they shall not enter therein, although they earnestly desire it. And when they shall turn their eyes towards the companions of hell fire, they shall say, 0 Lord, place us not with the ungodly people! This passage will be more easily understood if we quote a part of Sale's commentary: Before we proceed to a description of the Mohammedan paradise, we must not forget to say something of the wall or partition which they imagine to be between that place and hell, and seems to be copied from the great gulph of separation mentioned in scripture [Luke, xvi, 26]. They call it al Orf, and more frequently in the plural, al Araf, a word derived from the verb araf a, which signifies to distinguish between things, or to part them; tho* some commentators give another reason for the imposition of this name, because, say they, those who stand on this partition, will know and distinguish the blessed from the damned, by their respective marks or characteris tics: and others say the word properly intends any thing that is high raised or elevated, as such a wall or separation must be supposed to be. The Mohammedan writers greatly differ as to the persons who are to be found on al Araf. Some imagine it to be a sort of limbo, for the patriarchs and prophets, or for the martyrs and those who have been most eminent for sanctity, among whom they say there 51It is said, as Poe tells us in a note, that the remains of Gomorrah and other cities engulfed by the waters of the Dead Sea "may be dis covered by looking down into the transparent lake." In a letter to John Neal (December, 1829) regarding Al Aaraaf, Poe explains that he has "supposed many of the lost sculptures of our world to have flown (in spirit) to the star 'Al Aaraaf?a delicate place more suited to their divinity." See Woodberry's Poe, I, p. 59.</page><page sequence="14">An Interpretation of Poe's "Al Aaraaf" 119 will be also angels in the form of men. Others place here such whose good and evil works are so equal that they exactly counterpoise each other, and therefore deserve neither reward nor punishment; and these they say, will on the last day be admitted into paradise, after they shall have performed an act of adoration, which will be imputed to them as a merit, and will make the scale of their good works to overbalance. Others suppose this intermediate space will be a re ceptacle for those who have gone to war, without their parents' leave, and therein suffered martyrdom; being excluded paradise for their disobedience, and escaping hell because they are martyrs."52 The differences between the Mohammedan al Araf and Poe's Al Aaraaf may be summarized thus: 1. Al Araf is a wall permanently fixed to separate Hell from Heaven; Al Aaraaf is a star free to wander at God's direction throughout the universe. 2. Al Araf affords a view of both Heaven and Hell, and its in habitants are able to distinguish both the good and the evil by their respective marks; Al Aaraaf cannot approach Heaven, and is remote from Hell, and its inhabitants know nothing of good and evil, being non-moral. 3. Al Araf, according to Sale, is a sort of purgatory,53 and accord ing to the Koran, its inhabitants desire to enter Heaven but may not; Al Aaraaf is a place of happiness, and its inhabitants are content. Of the wandering habits of Al Aaraaf enough has been said already. The second and third points of difference, however, the happiness of the spirits of Al Aaraaf and their ignorance of good and evil, require further discussion. Happiness on Al Aaraaf is not the high felicity of Para dise, but a pleasurable contentment. It is like the sensuous luxuriance one might find on Earth In dreamy gardens, where do lie Dreamy maidens all the day.64 Nesace is the happiest creature on Al Aaraaf,58 but Ligeia is the most joyous.56 At its present anchorage the star is 52Sale, George: The Koran, London, 1734; Preliminary Discourse, Sec.

Their griefs are so softened that they seem almost pleasurable? Joy's voice so peacefully departed That, like the murmur in the shell Its echo dwelleth and will dwell.62 As Poe explains it in a note: Sorrow is not excluded from "Al Aaraaf," but it is that sorrow which the living love to cherish for the dead, and which, in some minds, resembles the delirium of opium. The passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures?the price of which, to those souls who make choice of 'Al Aaraaf as their residence after life, is final death and annihilation.63 Such happiness as the spirits of Al Aaraaf possess is pos sible only because they have no knowledge of good and evil, for such knowledge, as I have shown,64 is disastrous to all "Ibid., I, 20-21.

Its pure white ray is re fracted as it passes through death into the atmosphere of Al Aaraaf, which is apparently denser than that of Earth, and is there dispersed in its component colors. The "error" is the error of refraction, and it is sweet because it creates on Al Aaraaf a soothing influence that makes life there an unintellectual and unemotional state of dream. Hence, the spirits of this star know nothing of good and evil; they neither desire Heaven nor fear Hell, but find complete satis faction in the tranquil pleasures of dreams and fantasies. With the intellect and the passions they properly have noth ing to do. Beyond that death no immortality? But sleep that pondereth and is not "to be"? And there?oh! may my weary spirit dwell? Apart from Heaven's Eternity?and yet how far from Hell!66 "To be" here implies "to think"; hence there can be no im mortality without intellectual activity. To ponder, on the other hand, as Poe uses the word, is to engage in reverie or day-dreaming,67 which is an activity of the imagination Al Aaraaf, II, 159-165.

Not even in Al Aaraaf, however, is the spirit exempt from duty. Nesace, as we have seen, calls upon her subject spirits to aid her in carrying God's messages to all parts of the universe. They do not themselves reflect, but obey Nesace's commands, or else suffer just punishment; to quote Ianthe's phrase? not to us Be given our lady's bidding to discuss.08 Not even love can excuse disobedience, for Heaven no grace imparts To those who hear not for their beating hearts.69 The fate of Ianthe and Angelo is the fate of all on Al Aaraaf who fail in the performance of their duty. This does not mean that love is wholly forbidden, but it must not interfere with duty, as it probably will if it is passionate. 0! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over) Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known? Unguided Love hath fallen.70 Thought alone can make us partners of God's throne,71 but we may approach it through beauty sufficiently near to find in the effluence of divinity the fulfilment of our soul's highest aspirations. In Poe's earliest poems we find evidence of this conception of beauty as a means, independent of thought, by which we may communicate with God. In Stanzas (1827) he speaks of a "wild light" that had strange power over his spirit; it was perhaps the "urtembodied essence" of thought, given in beauty to those whose passion would otherwise draw them down to Hell. Beauty, or the love of beauty, is consequently of especial Value to those in whom the reasoning faculty is weak, because it is a bar to the degrading pull of the passions. Contrary to the general ?*Ibid., II, 245-246. ?Hbid., II, 176-177. Al Aaraaf, II, 179-181.

Al Aaraaf, the birthplace of the Idea of Beauty,72 is reserved for the spiritual abode of all lovers of beauty, apart from the enthusiasm of Heaven, yet safe from the misery of Hell. Ill Of the more recent interpretations of Al Aaraaf the full est is that of Professor W. B. Cairns.73 He agrees with Professor Woodberry and others in finding in the poem the doctrine that through devotion to the higher beauty one may avoid sin, which, being a passion or the fruit of passion, is antagonistic to beauty. He also points out the fact that both knowledge and passion are denied to the spirits of Al Aaraaf. But his most interesting suggestion is that "the idea of beauty indefinitely bodied forth in 'Al Aaraaf seems to foreshadow the critical theory of poetry" later formu lated by Poe. He thinks, however, that such foreshadowing was not consciously planned. "That 'Al Aaraaf was in tended as a presentation of Poe's view of poetry," he con cludes, "or that he had consciously formulated his critical theories in 1829, is hardly to be believed." It is my own opinion, notwithstanding the difficulty of establishing it, that Al Aaraaf was written by Poe with the conscious purpose of presenting allegorically his theory of poetry, and that this theory, as then conceived, was substan tially the same as later enunciated. The development of this purpose, with its aesthetic motif, constitutes the third structural element of the poem. Poe was himself by no means averse to the use of an un dercurrent of allegory, though he was strongly opposed to pure allegory, and went so far as to remark in one of his 72Al Aaraaf, I, 31. 73"Some Notes on Poe's 'Al Aaraaf / " Modern Philology, XIII, 35 44 (May, 1915).</page><page sequence="19">124 Studies in English essays that "all allegories are contemptible" ;74 he was pro voked to the statement, however, by a poor example of allegorical writing. He read with much interest and par tial approval the Kunstromane, or Art Novels, of Germany,75 which, he explains, are books written not so much in immediate defence, or in illustration, as in personification of individual portions of the Fine Arts?books which, in the guise of Romance, labor to the sole end of reasoning men into admiration and study of the beautiful, by a tissue of bizarre fiction, partly allegorical, and partly metaphysical. In Germany alone could so mad?or perhaps so profound?an idea have originated.76 His own Al Aaraaf is something like a personification of his theory of art; that is, it is pictorial rather than expository. As allegory it is impressionistic, not formal. All of his allegorical poems and tales?and most of the poems are allegorical to some extent?are of the impressionistic type with a few exceptions, such as The Conqueror Worm and William Wilson. Such allegories are of necessity indefinite, and their in definiteness illustrates a theory that was early formulated arid invariably adhered to by Poe throughout his career; namely, that the poem, unlike the romance, has "for its object an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure."77 This theory does not require, of course, that the poem be in coherent or obscure, but an unskillful artist may by attempt ing to follow it produce an obscure poem. That, apparently, is what happened in the case of Al Aaraaf. In one of his later critical essays Poe has said that all that we can understand or feel to be poetic has grown out of 74Review of H. B. Hirst's poems (Broadway Journal, July 12, 1845), Poe's Works, XII, p. 174. 75Carlyle says Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship is the earliest Kunstroman, and is considered by the Germans "greatly the first in excellence."

As thus used, the term "poetry," including painting, sculpture, ar chitecture, and music as well as the poetry of words, is equivalent to the term "art," and Poe has often employed it in this general sense. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us?but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle, by multiform combina tions among the things and thoughts of Time, to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps, appertain to eternity alone.79 The poet, then, is an inspired artist who seeks to reproduce in Earthly forms the Heavenly beauty revealed to him in visions. By the poet's reproductions, others are led to a contemplation of the beautiful, in which, Poe says, is found that elevation of soul?not of intellect or of heart?from which is derived the purest and most intense pleasure.80 The soul is elevated, or excited, in being made to harmonize more perfectly with divine beauty; hence poets become the means of drawing men closer to God. Poe declared beauty to be the sole province of the poem ;81 that is, of art. In our allegory, the star Al Aaraaf is the realm of beauty, and the spirits who dwell there are artists, lovers of beauty, whose duty it is to reveal to men the true nature of God. Nesace is the personification of beauty itself, while Ligeia is the personification of harmony, which is the quality of beauty that induces or stimulates in the artist the poetic sentiment. So it is that through Ligeia, Nesace arouses the spirits of Al Aaraaf to a sense of their duty, and urges them to the performance of it. In con ventional poetry the Muse bears the same relation to the poet 78The Poetic Principle, Poe's Works, XIV, p. 274. lbid., XIV, pp. 273-274. 8*Ibid., XIV, p. 275. 81The Philosophy of Composition, Poe's Works, XIV, p. 198.

The divine harmony, which Poe calls beauty, but which others have named truth, descends from God to men not in its original purity, but as made intelligible to terrestrial senses in perceptible forms of beauty, just as the absolute silence of God's voice is first translated into the material silence of Nesace's spiritual song, and then further translated into the audible music of Ligeia.82 God can be apprehended in only two ways: intellectually, by process of reason, and spiritually, by ecstasy or exalta tion of soul. The former is closed to man because his knowledge is yet imperfect. By the latter, therefore, that is, through feeling instead of thought, he must correct his misconceptions of God.83 The poet arranges the forms of terrestrial beauty in a semblance of the celestial pattern, in the contemplation of which man's soul is exalted to ecstasy and made one with the divine. Thus the poets, like the spirits of Al Aaraaf, are the messengers chosen of God to divulge the secrets of Heaven. Nesace, who, it will be remembered, receives her com mission from God by communication of thought, transfers it in music to her followers. But communication to men must be by other means, and that means is fantasy, or the imagination. As Nesace says, By winged Fantasy, My embassy is given, Till secrecy shall knowledge be In the environs of Heaven.84 Reason sees the pure white light of truth; fantasy sees the same light after it has been broken up into its component colors, that is, after refraction. On Al Aaraaf, it will be observed, the dominant colors are purple, opal, and gold? never pure white, except in the lily, where other symbolic values intrude. The philosopher is concerned with the pure ray, the artist with the component colors; and whereas the *2See Al Aaraaf, I, 124 ff., II, 64 ff., and II, 144 ff. 83See above, p. 114.

Images are created in the mind, then by the technical skill of the artist personified in forms of beauty.85 "Imagination is, possibly in man," says Poe, "a lesser degree of the creative power in God. What the Deity imagines is, but was not before. What man imagines, is, but was also. The mind of man cannot imagine what is not."86 It is, in fact, a kind of "chemistry of the intel lect," its "sole object and inevitable test" being the fabrica tion of beauty.87 Poe identified the human instinct of veneration with the faculty of ideality, which, in turn, he defined as the sentiment of poesy. "This sentiment is the sense of the beautiful, of the sublime, and of the mystical. . . . Imagination is its soul."88 But this faculty of ideality, this sense of the beautiful, has nothing to do with the passions of mankind.89 Even love, if it is passionate, hinders the poet in his devotion to beauty. Nesace, on this account, calls upon her spirits to forego love for duty: And true love caresses? O! leave them apart: They are light on the tresses, But lead on the heart.90 85Every one is familiar with Poe's definition of the poetry of words as "the rhythmical creation of beauty." In a review of Griswold's Poets and Poetry of America (Philadelphia Saturday Museum, 1843) he comments thus upon this definition: "Poetry . . . may be more properly defined as the rhythmical personification of existing or real beauty. One defines it as the 'rhythmical creation of beauty'; but though it certainly is a 'creation of beauty' in itself, it is more prop erly a personification, for the poet only personifies the image previously created by his mind."

They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.91 The artist who, for whatever reason, perverts his art by devoting it to the delineation of passion instead of beauty will "fall"; that is, he will cease to be a true artist. If passion is to be made the subject of poetry, it must be softened, for otherwise it is best suited to prose: True passion is prosaic?homely. Any strong mental emotion stimulates all the mental faculties; thus grief the imagination:?but in proportion as the effect is strengthened, the cause surceases. The excited fancy triumphs?the grief is subdued?chastened,?is no longer grief. In this mood we are poetic, and it is clear that a poem now written will be poetic in the exact ratio of its dispassion. A passion ate poem is a contradiction in terms.92 The sorrow of Al Aaraaf is precisely that softened grief "which the living love to cherish for the dead" that is here described as poetic.93 Sometimes a writer, as Tennyson in Locksley Hall, brings to the aid of passion the "terseness and pungency which are derivable from rhythm and from rhyme." But the effect produced is passionate, that of a "magnificent philippic," not poetic. The same poet's Oenone, on the other hand, exalts the soul to a conception of pure beauty, which "as far transcends earthly passion as the holy radiance of the sun does the glimmering and feeble phosphorescence of the glowworm." Poe admits that the majority of mankind are perhaps "more susceptible of the impulses of passion than of the impressions of beauty"; nevertheless he believes the sentiment of the beautiful to be a "divine sixth sense" which is yet little understood.94 91J6i*d., II, 263-264. 92Marginalia II, from the Democratic Review, December, 1844, Poe's Works, XVI, p. 56.

It is perhaps this divine Love without which the spirits of Al Aaraaf could not be happy? O, how, without you, Love! Could angels be blest?95 The distinction between passionate love and divine Love is clearly made by Poe in his essay on The Poetic Principle: It has been my purpose to suggest that, while this Principle itself is, strictly and simply, the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the Principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the Soul, quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of that Truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For, in regard to Passion, alas! its tendency is to de grade rather than elevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary?Love, the true, the divine Eros, the Uranian, as distinguished from the Dionaean Venus?is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes.96 Divine Love exalts the soul because it is akin to the instinct of veneration and the faculty of ideality, which Poe identi fied with the sentiment of poesy. It is this Uranian Eros who in IsrafePs heaven is a "grown-up God."97 The sonnet To Science, which was intended as a proem to Al Aaraaf, condemns science for destroying the world of romance and imagination. Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car, And driven the Hamadryad from the wood To seek a shelter in some happier star? Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood, The Elfin from the green grass, and from me The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?98 **Al Aaraaf, II, 88-89.

To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy? For what (to them) availeth it to know That Truth is Falsehood?-or that Bliss is Woe?100 It would destroy them by dissipating their illusions, the product of imagination, by which their existence is made calm and happy. In his critical essays Poe often assumes truth to be identical with knowledge and science as here used, opposing it to beauty and imagination. In this sense truth is inimical to art because it destroys the artist's illusions, thereby impairing his imagination and upsetting his values. It is not the function of art, therefore, to give instruction. If the artist must concern himself with morality, it should be only through suggestion. In a review of Lowell's poems, he complains of the "error of didacticism" in the Legend of Brittany. "The story," he adds, "might have been ren dered more unique, and altogether more in consonance with the true poetic sentiment, by suffering the morality to be suggested."101 Elsewhere he says that "didactic subjects are utterly beyond, or rather beneath, the province of true poesy."102 But truth may be properly employed to arouse the poetic sentiment; Coleridge, for example, wished in the Ancient Mariner "to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through "See p. 121 above. 1(x&gt;Al Aaraaf, II, 162-165. 101In Graham's Magazine, March, 1844.

"In fact, while the rhythm of this latter is an essential aid in the development of the poet's high est idea?the idea of the Beautiful?the artificialities of this rhythm are an inseparable bar to the development of all points of thought or expression which have their basis in Truth.

After the destruction of the world, this fact will be known. In the Colloquy of Monos and Una one of the characters says: Occasionally the poetic intellect?that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all?since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to the unaided reason bears no weight?occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condi tion of his soul.105 Here Poe is making an important distinction between the truth that is reached through reason and the truth that is attained by imagination. The former is conformity to the reality of Earth, the latter is conformity to the reality of Heaven, and hence supernal, ideal. Imagination, by which this divine truth is revealed, is the. soul or active principle of the sentiment of poesy, or sense of the beautiful.106 It is a more certain means to truth than reason. Truth is, in its own essence, sublime?but ^/tiest sublimity, as derived from man's clouded and erratic reason, is valueless?is pulseless?is utterly ineffective when brought into comparison with the unerring sense of which we speak.107 Poe goes so far as to express the belief that "all very profound knowledge" originates in a highly stimulated 103Review of The Book of Gems (Southern Literary Messenger, August, 1836), Poe's Works, IX, p. 95.

Kepler "guessed" the laws from which Newton deduced the fact of gravitation; that is, "he imagined them," grasped them with his soul "through mere dint of intuition."109 But it is in the artist that imagination is strongest; his glimpses of the supernal are clearest, and his knowledge of the great secrets is most profound. Through him chiefly must be revealed the divine truths now hidden from man and beyond the power of reason ever to attain. Yet this benefactor of the human race is little esteemed. When shall the artist assume his proper situation in society? . . . How long shall the veriest vermin of the Earth, who crawl around the altar of Mammon, be more esteemed of men than they, the gifted ministers to those exalted emotions which link us with the mysteries of Heaven?110 His answer is, "Not long." The poem Al Aaraaf, written several years before the words just quoted, was, I am con vinced, an attempt to improve the status of the artist in the opinion of the world. No argument is necessary to establish the fact that the poem exalts beauty, or that, in keeping with the sonnet, "To Science," originally printed as a head-piece, it condemns knowledge, or science. Does it thereby condemn truth? I think not; for Poe had in mind precisely that ideal truth, the truth of Heaven rather than the truth of Earth, which, as we have just seen, he later associated with poetry and imagination. This divine truth he identified with supernal beauty. He offered Eureka, as he explains in the preface, to those who feel, not think; "not in its character of Truth Teller, but for the Beauty that abounds in its Truth, con stituting it true." In the poem itself?for he calls it a poem, an "Art-Product"?he asserts that "a perfect con sistency can be nothing but an absolute truth."111 Of the 10*Fifty Suggestions, Poe's Works, XIV, p. 187. ^Eureka, Poe's Works, XVI, pp. 196-197. noReview of Chorley's Conti the Discarded, loc. cit., Poe's Works, VIII, p. 230. ^Eureka, Poe's Works, XVI, p. 196.</page><page sequence="28">An Interpretation of Poe's "Al Aaraaf" 133 Nebular Theory of Laplace, for example, he says, "It is by far too beautiful, indeed, not to possess Truth as its essen tiality."112 Symmetry he calls "the poetical essence of the Universe"; but "symmetry and consistency are convertible terms:?thus Poetry and Truth are one." Hence the con clusion : "Man cannot long or widely err, if he suffer him self to be guided by his poetical, which I have maintained to be his truthful, in being his symmetrical, instinct."113 Thus the spirits of Al Aaraaf, the artists of our human world, reveal through beauty the truth of Heaven. When this truth shall become known?when secrecy shall knowledge be In the environs of Heaven? then man may rise in thought towards God and become a partner of His throne.114 If this study has made Poe's Al Aaraaf more intelligible, my main purpose is accomplished. I should like to think, however, that it has also helped to give significance to a poem often unappreciated. By way of conclusion, I should like to bring two suggestions to the attention of students of Poe. In the first place, I believe we misjudge Poe when we class him as a worshipper of beauty for its own sake. On the contrary, he loved beauty as a revealer of truth beyond the scope of reason. In the second place, I wish to point out what I hope has already become evident; namely, that Poe developed his theory of poetry at the very begin ning of his career, and that to the end of his life it remained substantially as originally conceived. 112Eureka, Poe's Works, XVI, p. 252. 113/6io\, p. 302. 114See Al Aaraaf, I, 110-117.</page></plain_text>
