<plain_text><page sequence="1">* ABSTRACT Darwin's textual representation of the theory of the transmutation of species is a web of evidence, logic, figurative discourse and artful rhetoric addressing the highly diverse philosophical presuppositions of his audience. His metaphors served multiple functions which must be analyzed before his argument can be accurately interpreted. Published versions slyly present a theory in docile and complete conformity to the methodological ideology dominating and legitimating early nineteenth-century British natural and human science. Their ironic rhetorical strategy creates an appearance of conformity to an ideology he opposed to the point of causing the 'whole fabric to totter and fall'. This is true, not only of his methodological views, but also of his positions on larger metaphysical issues: materialism and the relation of the social instincts to the moral sentiments. The cultural circle to whose work Darwin responded included individuals whose opposed positions concerning the cultural and methodological issues raised by his theory freed him from slavish attachment to any school and enabled him to construct a flexible foundation for the human sciences. The terms 'external factors' and 'ideology' here refer only to particular sorts of information used in the construction of a scientific text but not subject to consensual methodological and interpretative criteria. Darwin had to form a new field of inquiry and assemble a new community from competent investigators who did not share a common technical form of discourse: the earliest drafts of his theory were therefore heavily influenced by such factors. 'External Factors' and 'Ideology' in the Earliest Drafts of Darwin's Theory Edward Manier The aims of this paper are to examine the role of a special class of external factors in the development of the earliest drafts of the young Darwin's theory of the transmutation of species, and to show that, in Darwin's hands, these factors facilitated the construction of a novel and empirically fruitful research programme. Careful consideration of such factors transforms standard views of the ideological context of the pre- publication development of Darwin's theory.1 The paper is in three sections: the first clarifies the terms 'external factors' and 'ideology' as I use them in analyzing the materials of this Social Studies of Science (SAGE, London, Newbury Park, Beverly Hills and New Delhi), Vol. 17 (1987), 581-609</page><page sequence="2">582 Social Studies of Science case study; the second discusses Darwin's reaction to and use of prevalent currents in the ideology of science on key issues concerning methodology, materialism and the moral sense; and the third analyzes the role of expository strategies in the development of new fields of scientific inquiry. The section on methodology in the second part covers the young Darwin's views on the relation of induction and deduction; verae causae, or the role of real causal relations in scientific explanation; the uses of historical analysis in biology; teleology; and chance. The Young Darwin and His Cultural Circle In the interval between the centenaries of the publication of The Origin of Species (1959) and the death of its author (1982), a plethora of new studies have analyzed one of the most detailed archives in the history of science - the notebooks, reading lists, correspondence, heavily annotated personal library materials, and unpublished manuscripts of Charles Darwin.2 The result is an increasingly rich account of the stages in his development, from the voyage of the Beagle (1831-36) and before, to the eventual publication of The Origin and its revision, under relatively heavy scientific criticism, through six editions. One conclusion emerging from this quarter century of scholarship is that Darwin's persuasive style lent an appearance of unity to an extremely complex and steadily changing pattern of scientific practice. His published work does not reveal an ideally unified set of theoretical goals and standards independent of the vagaries of time and social context. Although, soon after his marriage in 1839, Darwin removed himself from physical centres of scientific activity in favour of the more peaceful life of a country squire (or 'squarson')3 at Down, scholars of the Darwin archive have found him in touch with a surprising range of the major intellectual currents of his day - from obviously relevant and closely related scientific fields (for example, geology, invertebrate zoology, embryology and general physiology) to a variety of social and philosophical ideas, including such important sources from the Scottish Enlightenment as Adam Smith, Dugald Stewart and the barrister and historian of ethics James Mackintosh. I concentrate on the archival materials from a very brief, but intensely productive, period in Darwin's career, the interval 1837-39, immediately following his return from the Beagle voyage, and immediately preceding his move from London to Down. This period marks Darwin's early commitment to the theory of transmutation of species as an explanation of human evolution, and includes materials addressing wide-ranging</page><page sequence="3">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 583 aspects of the ideology of science raised by such an explanation. These personal documents, for the most part unpublished before 1974, show that issues (such as the nature of consciousness, mind and the moral sense) thought by earlier scholars to have been deferred until well after the original furore over The Origin had subsided, and publicly discussed only in The Descent of Man and The Expression of Emotion in Animals and Man, were focal from the start of his efforts to formulate his theory. Darwin, in other words, thought of his theory of transmutation of species as contributing to the human sciences and dealt with the methodological, metaphysical and moral issues raised by this conception at the start of his scientific career. The archival materials demonstrate that he was thoroughly in touch with a complex and changing cultural scene, and that he maintained effective critical distance from the philosophical views of admired elder mentors from his Cambridge days. His views were subtle, radical, personal. They included the formation of a deliberate strategy for presenting his theory to a definite audience or micro-community (the likes of Herschel, Whewell and Lyell), largely disposed, particularly in the interval 1837-44, to reject his comprehensive account of evolution (and particularly its naturalistic understanding of humanity). His rhetorical strategy seems to have been less influenced by others - whether correspondents and close acquaintances such as J. D. Hooker, or such generally visible figures as Robert Chambers and Baden Powell - who might have agreed with his views. His strategy involved masking the more controversial aspects of his methodology, and deferring and blurring the ontological and ethical implications of his explanation of human origins. Darwin's scientific career included what Dudley Shapere has called 'a process of internalization', by which science gradually achieves 'autonomy from external influences in building its future beliefs, methods, problems, rules of reasoning, explanatory patterns, stanclards, and goals'. 4 But this autonomy was a hard-won, historically and socially constructed achievement. Darwin used material from a great variety of sources in producing his theory, and then in representing it, first to a few close, competent friends and critics, and then to the public at large. The discursive connections making it possible for him to describe and explain the objects of his theory most certainly were embedded within the basic institutions of his society.5 Readers of this journal may ordinarily construe 'external factors' and 'ideology' as referring to the material and cognitive aspects of such institutions. I neither reject nor emulate such usage. I cannot emulate it because I cannot answer the questions. What sort of order is to</page><page sequence="4">584 Social Studies of Science be found in this diverse array of social forms? How is Darwin's relation- ship with them to be established, described and analyzed? The relation of his theory of evolution to the rapid strides in British agriculture, national interests in world empire, the liberal utilitarian secularization of the modern world-view, are all important to his thought. But I am unable to bring either the institutional or the ideological background of his theory into sharp focus by such abstract and general considerations. I seek to establish a method for mediating our understanding of Darwin's relation to such broad currents of thought by a very careful analysis of his relationship with fundamental works in the philosophy of science, ethics, aspects of the philosophy of mind developed in response to early systematic work in neurobiology, and the social sciences. I work with a file of materials which the Darwin archives reveal were read carefully and criticized from a creative and independent perspective unique to the young Darwin. My studies deal with a much earlier stage of Darwin's thought than that dealt with by John Greene's important study of Darwin as a social evolutionist,6 and therefore my conclusions are not in direct conflict with his views on that topic. While my interpretation can be rigorously documented within the period of Darwin's life upon which it is based, it makes no claim to interpret Darwin's public life and published work after 1859. Instead, I reflect upon the very private and personal reading, reflection and writing undertaken by Darwin in the late twenties and early thirties of his own life. I offer no suggestions concerning the processes or stages of his discovery of his theory, however, except insofar as the process of discovery involves articulating the theory's wider philosophic, social and cultural significance. My study of the young Darwin uses a definition of 'social circle' first published by Charles Kadushin.7 The members of a social circle need not enjoy relationships of direct or immediate contact, acquaintance or communication; the connections linking the individuals or groups comprising the circle may be indirect, through third parties, or through correspondence or publication. This network of connections exists because of some interest (for example, cognitive, social, political, or artistic) linking the members of the group. I use the term to refer to the individuals with whom Darwin was in significant direct or indirect communication concerning the scientific form and detail and the ideo- logical implications of his theory. The membership of this group was determined by his interest in each member, either as a source of signifi- cant scientific or ideological information, or as a potentially significant critic, or both.</page><page sequence="5">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 585 Darwin's scientific and cultural circles were not comprised of individuals all of whom had been trained in the same academic disciplines, attended the same professional meetings or submitted to the judgement of a common group of referees for a common group ofjournals. Kuhn's characterization of the relative unanimity among members of sub-disciplinary research fronts is in sharp contrast with situations like Darwin's, in which an indi- vidual or a small group presents a comprehensive new theory which will unite previously diverse fields and create various new problems, if only a significant number of scientifically reputable converts can be made.8 Darwin took evidence, conceptual machinery and 'ideology' (this term will be clarified shortly) from a number of diverse fields, and persuasively and coherently represented a novel integration of that material. To accomplish this, he had first to master a language enabling him to describe and explain the various elements of his theory to a small group of competent critics, and eventually to by-pass these critics by, as it were, going directly to a much wider and diverse set of scientific audiences and educated lay readers. This language was both formed by the membership of his scientific and cultural circles and, in its turn, helped determine the membership of those groups by drastically enlarging their membership. Those groups provided the most immediate, revelatory, and sharply defined bases for the discursive events comprising the presentation, critical scientific evaluation and cultural assimilation of the theory of the transmutation of species. Darwin's task was at once cognitive and social. He had to combine evidence from geology, biogeography, invertebrate zoology, comparative embryology and anatomy, as well as the nascent human sciences (for example linguistics, demography, economics) to create a new field of scientific inquiry. He had to present a theoretical unification of that diverse body of evidence in language which would enable him both to assemble and to communicate with new scientific communities, new audiences of com- petent critics. Since the ideological implications of his views were at odds with the beliefs of many in his audience, including several with whom he was otherwise in closest contact, he made a particularly careful effort to express his own beliefs as precisely, albeit metaphorically, as possible. Darwin chose his metaphors very carefully and the context within which he did so deserves thorough and critical analysis.9 'External Factors' and 'Ideology' It is necessary to clarify the sense in which the terms 'external factors'</page><page sequence="6">586 Social Studies of Science and 'ideology' are used in this paper. In general, I use the term to refer to uses of power and information within specific scientific research areas which have not been legitimated by intra-field consensus. The focus here is on information rather than on economic or other material manifestations of power, and I think of external factors (and ideology) in terms such as the following: beliefs generally or influentially held in adjacent domains or fields of inquiry which cannot be subject to the methodological criteria proper to the research area or scientific domain in question. Unlike LeCourt and the Marxist epistemologists he analyzes, I do not here refer to the institutional frameworks which provide such beliefs with their persuasive force; but that is only because I wish, in this article, to operate within a more restricted domain for the sake of raising a new set of questions. 1Q As I construe the terms here, neither external factors nor ideology need to be considered a source of irrationality in science. There is no reason to think that the methodological consensus of any given research area at a given time defines or limits what could count as good reasons within its developing research programme. It also does not follow that the role of external factors or ideology in science is not subject to critique, both by the scientists within a given research area and by others observing and analyzing their activities. The ideological context of science is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, including at least the following levels: 1. Information from other scientific disciplines which may be part of wider scientific consensus but which cannot be appraised or evaluated by techniques or in terms shared, for instance, by all geologists or all biologists. Darwin and Lyell, for example, had this sort of relationship with various cosmological theories, particularly those having to do with concepts of a gradually cooling earth. Darwin had this sort of relationship with information concerning electricity and magnetism and with the techniques and results of the newly emerging discipline of statistics. 1 l 2. General methodological prescriptions providing putative demarca- tion criteria separating acceptably scientific procedures from non-science or pseudo-science. Darwin, for example, did not subject the views of Herschel, Whewell and Comte concerning verae causae, consilience of inductions, and laws of nature, to explicit, detailed, articulate and sustained scrutiny from his own perspective as a naturalist. He might have done so, but he did not. He reacted to their views succinctly and pungently in the course of getting on with his own work. Such information functioned in his scientific practice without first being subjected to public analysis and criticism of any kind, and a fortiori, none that might have commanded general agreement in his developing field.</page><page sequence="7">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 587 3. Metaphysical beliefs concerning, for example, the adequacy of a materialist ontology; the place of chance in a cosmos perceived to operate as a determined mechanism; the status and function of such important distinctions as those between nature and culture, or the sacred and the profane. 4. Moral beliefs or systems of thought of the sort associated with utilitarianism, Kantianism or romanticism. The topics alluded to in points 3 and 4 are developed below. 5. The social-economic-political beliefs embedded in the dominant institutions of a society. For Darwin these would include views concerning the division of labour in the modern factory system analyz- ed by Adam Smith, the prevalent admiration for the methods and prac- tical successes of British agriculturalists ('artificial selection'), the liberal perspective of the day on such matters as the British empire, the fran- chise, slavery and so on. Such beliefs are undoubtedly significant, but their analysis does not fall within the methodological limits of this paper. 6. The level Foucault labelled the 'microtechnologies of power': the dimension of the power-knowledge relationships built up within the direct and indirect face-to-face exchanges which characterize small group activities ('situations') within the larger scientific community.'2 Darwin, for example, 'cared only' for the opinion of a few eminent men of science. The next section focuses precisely upon Darwin's dialectical relationship with the ideological framework dominating this micro-social environment. This analysis clarifies and supports the claim that the technical practice of specific areas of scientific research is inextricably connected with a wider cognitive matrix (that is, with so-called external factors and ideology). No specific research methodology is rich enough to subject the dimensions of thought listed above to systematic critical evaluation, nor does the practice of science take place in such rarefied, depersonalized, abstract and mechanical situations as to isolate it from the impact of any one of these dimensions. Nor are such inextricable relationships between science and its contexts limited to the great revolutionary episodes in the history of science. These episodes have ideological consequences which set a pattern for a new understanding of the relation of science and society, or of nature and culture. Much of the force and plausibility of Kuhn's distinction of normal and revolutionary science follows upon the fact that 'normal' scientists do not seem to fight ideological wars. 13 But this is only to say that they operate in contexts the ideological dimen- sions of which have been determined by their predecessors, not that they operate in ideology-free contexts.</page><page sequence="8">588 Social Studies of Science Scientific results may be represented in ideologically loaded language even if the author of the language is unaware of, or in opposition to, the ideology. Ideologically loaded representations can result from an effort to communicate scientific results to a particular audience. Such efforts typically include, and even emphasize, non-technical language: colloquialisms, idiomatic forms of speech, or metaphorical patterns reflecting the characteristic ideology of the intended audience. Identifying this language (or the information, beliefs and attitudes which it represents) as 'ideological' rather than 'scientific' means simply that its representative functions are not subject to standards which could result in unconstrained consensus among the members of a given research area. The inherent ambiguity of the term 'ideology' reflects the real and significant diversity of factors significantly affecting scientific practice, the representation of scientific results, and scientific judgements of plausibility, adequacy and accuracy. Connections between ideology and theories of evolution are unusually strong and inextricable because of a basic human tendency to search for, and find meaning and significance in, deep similarities of natural and cultural forms. Nature becomes more familiar and man can more readily be included within the scope of the natural sciences to the extent that scientific knowledge of nature is represented by symbols highlighting the analogies between natural and cultural forms. In turn, the readiest form of cultural legitimation is the claim that particular institutions are natural and necessary, or that they have natural and necessary roots in an historical or evolutionary past.'4 Neither 'external factor' nor 'ideology' is used here with the pejorative connotations ordinarily associated with 'irrationality', 'propaganda' or 'bad faith'. The intent is to facilitate the rational critique of their role in the development of science. This is done by expanding the criteria already familiar to philosophers of science to the analysis of the impact of a wider range of topics upon the actual practice of science and the representation of scientific results. The following questions require a perspective only slightly larger than that of orthodox philosophy of science: 1. To what extent can external factors function to enlarge and enhance the empirical adequacy of a scientific theory, its semantic precision, its heuristic significance, its explanatory capabilities? 2. Under what conditions are such functions most effectively realized? Under what conditions are such functions likely to remain unrealized and what are the remedies for such failure? Given the proposed analysis, it is for the historian of science to decide whether or not external factors have or have not affected the explanatory</page><page sequence="9">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 589 power or semantic adequacy of a given representation of scientific activity. Success in such respects may well generate disciplinary consensus after the fact. Such consequent consensus should not draw attention away from its ideological antecedents or its concurrent ideological milieu. Studies of science which ignore or delete (by rationally reconstructing) the ideological roots of successful scientific practice beg the first of the two questions in this paragraph (in the face of considerable historical evidence in favour of the opposite view) and are inadequate to deal with the second. Ideological Aspects of the Work of the Young Darwin In what follows I will sketch the young Darwin's views in three key areas: methodology, metaphysics and his theory of the moral sense. There is no novelty in the thesis that much of what we think of as 'Darwinism' is an ideological blend of the theodicy, economics, moral philosophy and philosophy of his day. The view for which I claim some novelty is that, during the period of his greatest youthful creativity, Darwin was neither the slightly muddled Cartesian John Greene discovered almost three decades ago, nor a pale prototype of twentieth-century philosophical naturalism. Few Darwin scholars have noted the importance for Darwin of the aesthetic and epistemological works of Dugald Stewart, the emi- nent proponent of Scottish Realism. Darwin took an account of concept formation from Stewart which provided him with more than enough philosophical ammunition to reject Cartesian criteria for mathematical clarity and distinctness in biological concepts. An essential portion of Darwin's auto-pedagogical experience in the crucial interval 1837-44, was the elaboration of a set of tropes for the expression of concepts of spontaneity, novelty, creativity and purpose. Stewart's philosophy of metaphor provided legitimacy for such discourse, and critical inter- pretation of the resultant uses of language in the prepublication drafts of The Origin enhances our understanding of the full range of possible relationships of science, society and culture. 15 Methodology Careful analysis of the unpublished materials from the interval 1837-39 has demonstrated that, in the earliest drafts of his theory (1842 and 1844), Darwin used the received methodology of the day (that developed</page><page sequence="10">590 Social Studies of Science by J. F. W. Herschel and William Whewell) to organize and present his views, in spite of the fact that his own scientific practice was at odds with that methodology in fundamental respects. His differences with Whewell and Herschel include (1) his rejection of Whewell's thesis concerning the role of teleology in biology; (2) his rhetorical simulation of Herschel's criteria for verae causae in the basic outline of his arguments for the transmutation of species, in spite of the fact that his own position did not conform (and could not have conformed) to those criteria; (3) his conflation of the inductive basis of his theory with its deductive implication; (4) his insistence upon the importance of studies of the history of living organisms as a means of arriving at the underlying laws of biology; and (5) the central role played by the concept of chance in his theory. We will discuss these in turn below. The rhetorical strategy embodied in the earliest drafts of his theory, and continued through all its published versions, muted these differences with Whewell and Herschel by presenting his views as conforming to the received methodology when that was possible, and by avoiding direct, sustained, explicit discussions of those concepts (chance, teleology) and criteria (mathematical precision and deductive rigour) where the appearance of conformity was out of the question. For the most part Darwin's explicit metaphors are intended to close the gap between nature and culture, and the harsher uses of irony seem alien to his style. To the contrary, the central thesis of my interpretation is that Darwin's rhetorical strategy is basically ironic, that it involves constructing an appearance of conformity to an ideology which he understood himself to oppose, even to the point of causing 'the fabric to totter and fall'.'6 The fabric he undermined was the ideology forming and legitimating early nineteenth-century British natural science. My discussion of Darwin's rhetorical use of Herschel and Whewell does not address the adequacy or inadequacy of his methodology or his expository strategy. Rather, it shows that the published versions of the theory misrepresent its underlying methodology in interesting and subtle ways, and that the significance of the theory can only be understood through a careful analysis of the processes of negotiation and social construction leading to his public rhetorical strategy. 1. Whewell's teleology The notebooks, manuscripts, and marginalia of 1837-39 show a clear preference for Comte's critique of scientific uses of teleology, and a combination of rejection and extensive working of Whewell's Kantian</page><page sequence="11">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 591 views on the subject. His reaction to Whewell is clear in his marginal comments in his personal copy of the latter's History of the Inductive Sciences.'7 Where Whewell wrote 'That the parts of the bodies of animals are made (*) in order to discharge their respective offices (**) is a conviction which we cannot believe to be otherwise than an irremovable principle of the philosophy of organization', Darwin replaced 'made' with the words 'born, altered', and inserted 'under changing circumstances' after 'offices', indicating a strong interest in distinguishing his transmutationist perspective in biology from Whewell's philosophy. Darwin naturalized the notion of final causality, characterizing adapta- tion as a topic for scientific description and analysis. He did not reject Whewell' s claims concerning the heuristic advantage that could be made of naturalized analogues of the concept of design, but he opposed those over- tones of 'design' which suggested that every aspect of every organism had its adaptive use. Darwin marked the passage in which Whewell outlined Kant's account of the necessity of a regulative teleological principle in biology, 'All this reasoning is vitiated, when we look at animals, in my view', objecting to a regulative function for the principle of teleology because it put the problem of adaptation beyond analysis. Adaptation was not to be regarded as a necessary condition for a certain sort of inquiry, but a fact to be explained like other facts. Darwin was given to ironic comments on the topic: 'When a man inherits a harelip, or a diseased liver, is this adaptation . .. doubtless it is in one sense, but not in that which these philosophers mean'. He preferred Comte's determinism: Now it is not a little remarkable that the fixed laws of nature should be universally thought to be the will of a superior being, whose nature can only be rudely traced out. When one sees this, one suspects that our will may arise from as fixed laws of organization. M. Lecomte argues against all contrivance. It is what my views tend to.18 His published comments, on the other hand, finessed this issue by using general references to the Creator of the sort used to conclude The Origin: There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved. 19 2. Herschel and verae causae J. F. W. Herschel was a leading member of the British scientific com- munity during the period in question, and Darwin's espousal of his</page><page sequence="12">592 Social Studies of Science general methodological position was genuine enough.20 Herschel's criteria for establishing true causes (verae causae) dominated the structural outline of the earliest complete drafts of the transmutation theory as well as all its subsequent published versions.21 This outline divided Darwin's argument into two basic parts. The first part established the possibility or plausibility of a theoretical core of propositions stating the occurrence of heritable variability in organisms, the non-random distribution of chances of leaving fertile offspring as a function of the relative adapted- ness of some of those variations (natural selection and the struggle for existence), and environmental conditions leading to the reproductive isolation and continued accumulation of particular variations within subgroups of organisms, leading, in some instances, to the formation of new species. The second part claimed to test this theoretical core by trying it in the explanation of large and independent classes of facts from biogeography, paleography, comparative embryology and anatomy, and taxonomy. This latter claim, however, was glaringly inappropriate. The second part of Darwin's argument contains no detail relevant to a test of the crucial theses concerning adaptation, the struggle for existence, or natural selection. Darwin provided no empirical evidence concerning the process of natural selection or the details of adaptation for any of the types of phenomena discussed in the second part of his argument; and, in general, was not satisfied with the available information concerning conditions favouring the survival and reproduction of members of naturally occurring populations.22 Although the logical structure of Darwin's total argument appeared to conform to the explanatory practice recommended by Herschel (broadly speaking, that of the nomological-deductive method complicated by requirements that a 'truly causal hypothesis' would explain many indepen- dent classes of fact, lead to the discovery of important facts previously unknown, and resolve apparent counter-examples to its validity by offering satisfactory explanations of them as well), the logical vocabulary Darwin used to state the relations between the core theory and various 'test' phenomena exhibited considerable vacillation. The inferential relations suggested by such diverse expressions as 'necessarily follow', 'might a priori have been expected', 'throw light upon', and 'instead of being metaphorical becomes plain' were confused and run together. Such expres- sions were used by Darwin interchangeably and indiscriminately. The result, from a purely logical point of view, was a verbal smokescreen confusing the effort to evaluate evidence for and against the theory. As a bare, literal, logical skeleton, the theory had serious logical shortcomings.</page><page sequence="13">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 593 3. Conflation of inductive and deductive aspects of inquiry Moreover, the distinction between evidence which could count toward the possibility of the theory (Part One of the argument) and that which could count as positive evidence for or against it (Part Two) was not one for which there was any evidence or argument in the archival materials dating from 1837 to 1839. Such a division certainly did not mark the chronological path of the investigations recorded in the Transmutation Notebooks, nor do those Notebooks analyze or even mention this methodological distinction. On the contrary, the laws of geological and geographical distribution (identified as part of the testing evidence in the second part of all the complete versions of the theory) were among the very first to be considered in the Notebooks, as one might well expect from the relevance of the recently completed Beagle voyage to Darwin's grasp of their importance. From the start of the Notebooks Darwin was working with a rough outline of a general theory of the transmutation of species, and used that theory in a decidedly heuristic fashion to open up new areas of investigation and lines of inquiry.23 This intermingling of inductive and deductive aspects of theory construc- tion was explicitly reflected in a passage written around the time the implications for his hypothesis of the Malthusian scissors became clear (October 1838). 'I, from looking at all facts as inducing towards law of transmutation cannot see the deductions which are possible'. 24 Departure, in published work, from the straightforward chronology of investigation is commonplace. Why emphasize it here? Because the putative tests invoked in the second part of Darwin's presentation have nothing to do with the key theses of the struggle for existence and natural selection. As evidence, the phenomena of biogeography, bio- geology, comparative embryology and anatomy, and organic classifica- tion pertain to an earlier, more general theory of the transmutation of species, a theory lacking the distinctive Malthusian mechanism of the published versions.25 Darwin's rhetorical use of Herschel's methodology, therefore, not only did not conform to the chronology of his own scientific investigation, it was called into question by the details of that chronology. 4. History and the laws of life The investigative strategy expressed in Darwin's unpublished materials, with its combination of natural history, the laws of (historical, or evolu- tionary) change and the general (physiological) laws of life, conformed to no (currently) received philosophical model of adequate scientific</page><page sequence="14">594 Social Studies of Science explanation.26 Darwin's investigative practice was instructively at odds with Comte's distinction of fundamental and historical laws, and Herschel's distinction of empirical laws and laws of nature.27 Darwin identified the investigation of the 'primary forms of life', the 'laws of life' and the 'laws of change of organic form' as among the goals of natural history, seeing a complex, sequential interaction between the natural historian and the developmental physiologist. A sketch of the organism's evolutionary history and the history of its environment would be necessary for the formulation of the laws of the 'corelation of parts', which would in turn be necessary for any law-like statements concerning the variation of races. Eventually, knowledge of the 'laws of specific change' would make it possible to identify the 'primary forms' of living things - that is, the small number of different ancestral forms from which all living things have descended. Darwin thought it possible to establish the laws of life (for example the laws of reproduction, embryological development, social behaviour) only in this evolutionary context. Once this goal was approximated, a second stage of analysis could accomplish a more perfect and general statement of the formal laws of correlation of parts and organs, of the types and limits of variation, and of the gaps to be anticipated between races or species of the same ancestry. A revised evolutionary history would then set the stage for more conclusive study of the 'physical causes' and conditions of reproduction, development and metabolism. Far from mere applied physiology, natural history was portrayed as an indispensable element in the design of basic physiological inquiry and the generalization of the fundamental laws of life.28 The expository strategy Darwin employed in publishing his findings, on the other hand, was modelled on standards and criteria of scientific adequacy appropriate to investigations (primarily in experimental physics and physical astronomy) quite unlike the one upon which Darwin had embarked. Neither Herschel nor Comte countenanced a role for the natural history of living organisms in establishing the basic laws of life. While Darwin's effort to conform to these received philosophical models was an understandable effort to place his views on a recognizable and solid foundation, it resulted in his theories being judged by standards fundamentally at odds with the goals of his enterprise. 5. Darwin's ambivalence about 'chance' Similar comments are appropriate concerning Darwin's use of the concept of chance. His opinions on the topic fall into two opposed categories. On</page><page sequence="15">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 595 the one hand he held it wholly incorrect to speak of chance as the cause of anything, and insisted that such language could only be understood to acknowledge ignorance of an actual cause.29 And each organic variation must have its own distinct, precise and sufficient cause, which if it occurred a hundred times in a hundred comparable circumstances would have a hundred identical effects.30 In such passages Darwin wrote as if his new field of inquiry could meet the standards of adequacy (for example determinism) demanded of an experimenital science. This new field, however, was anything but experimental. Claude Bernard's views about determinism in biology apply to a quite distinct sort of inquiry, having little or nothing in common with biogeography in the first half of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, Darwin clearly stated that certain events may, in the strictest possible sense of the word, be termed accidental. Acci- dental events result from the haphazard intersection of two or more lines of causality - for instance the quite separate and independent lines of causality accounting for the origin of organic variations and those accounting for the interaction of organisms with the changing environmental circumstances which biases the chances of leaving fertile offspring.31 Of the two positions, the first is expressed much more frequently in the published works, but the second occurs throughout the early notebooks and manuscripts and the concept clearly played a cogent, controlled and central role in his investigations from their inception. The first use of 'chance' in the Notebooks was in the context of a geneological explanation of the gaps to be found between such large taxonomic groups as the vertebrata and the articulata.32 If we ... go very far back ... to the source of the mammalian type of organization, it is extremely improbable that any of the successors of his relations shall now exist. In same manner, if we take a man from any large family of 12 brothers and sisters in a state which does not increase it will be chances against any one of them having progeny living ten thousand years hence because at present day many are relatives, so that by tracing back the fathers would be reduced to small percentage therefore the chances are excessively great against any two of the 12 having progeny after that distant period. Hence, if this is true... the greater the groups the greater the gaps... of continuous structure between them. For instance, there would be great gap between birds and mammalia, still greater between vertebrate and articulata, still greater between animals and plants. Darwin offered rough and approximate statistical inferences. Assuming common parentage at some distant point in the past, a fairly high rate of extinction after a period of 105 to 107 generations would explain the</page><page sequence="16">596 Social Studies of Science elimination of intermediate forms and the production of great gaps in what might have been a structural and functional continuum if every organism replaced itself, generation after generation. The low chances of leaving fertile progeny after such great lapses of time explained the hierarchical pattern of phylogenetic classification. The pyramidal hierarchy was a consequence of the fact that as one traced lineages into the past one encountered increasing numbers of extinct organic types. Darwin's Notebook references to 'chance' verged on an awareness of the importance of statistical explanation as an alternative to various causal hypotheses, often with vitalist overtones, which might be offered to explain the geographical distribution of organic types.33 Did each element or dominant structure adapt itself to as many situations as possible? Darwin rejected the 'so-called progressive tendency law' as vitalistic. He made a serious effort to connect the concepts of dominance, adaptation and chance. 'Chance - in causal contexts - signalled that an irreducible plurality of otherwise distinct forces had intersected to produce the phenomenon in question: for example, the dominance of a particular group would be explained by the intersection of its distinctive characteristics and relatively transient meteorological and geological circumstances. This attributed no causal force to chance itself. Birds were blown to new volcanic islands by gales; amphibians or small land animals were carried by floating debris and sea currents, plant seeds could be transported in any of these ways, or in or on the bodies of animals so transported. To say that migration was a haphazard phenomenon was to say that chances of colonization would fall off with distance or with the average height of an isolating barrier, or that they would be greater for the members of an already numerous group. For Darwin, statistical inference consisted of statements of such inequalities, rather than quantita- tively precise prediction, but the ubiquity of implicit and explicit forms of such inference in the archival materials is more than sufficient evidence of the central role of the concept of chance in his theory. Herschel's sympathetic review of Quetelet in 1850 signalled a slow and partial growth in the general philosophical acceptance of the validity of statistical explanation in the nineteenth century.34 Comte's unremitting and total rejection of Quetelet's use of statistics in the social sciences, and his denunciation of the theory of chance as 'offering our own ignorance as the natural measure of the degree of probability of our various opinions', however, was more representative. The climate of opinion Darwin faced was one in which the use of any form of statistical inference risked contemptuous dismissal as an appeal to the 'law of</page><page sequence="17">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Dar-win 597 higgledy-piggledy' (Herschel's personal comment on Darwin's theory soon after its publication in 1859). Darwin publicly defended the concept of chance only by stressing the general unacceptability of theses concerning evolutionary progress. As he saw it, only rare and unusual and randomly occurring circumstances prevented the extinction of even the most fit of organisms. The relativiza- tion of the notion of adaptation to an organism's situation vis-a-vis transient competition in a transient environment took the place of explicit methodological defence of the concept of chance or of the role of statistical inference in his theory. Darwin's Materialism Darwin's references to materialism had a self-mocking tone: 'Oh you materialist'",3 but he invented a strategy for publicly avoiding any admission 'how far I believe in materialism'. 36 The varieties of materialism held by members of his cultural circle help explicate this aspect of his ideology. First, it should be emphasized that no member of Darwin's circle could be termed a materialist in the strictest reductionist sense. That is, no one, not even the notorious pioneer of neurophysiology, Dr William Lawrence, not August Comte, not Lamarck, held the thesis central to the manifesto of the German biophysicists at the end of the next decade, that all organic processes were to be explained by means of physical, molecular and atomic mechanisms.37 Lawrence and Comte were particularly aware of the difficulties in a uniform application of the conceptual and mathematical apparatus of Newtonian physics to biological phenomena. Lawrence was critical of the loose analogies in Lamarck's account of nervous and caloric fluids whose agitation co- ordinates the movements of animals and plants and constitutes the emotions and sensations of animals. But neither was Lamarck a prophetic voice straightening the path for the German materialist manifesto in physiology, insisting, as he did, upon the unbridgeable differences involved in the four systematic gaps dividing (1) living and non-living bodies, (2) plants and animals, (3) animals with and without feeling, and (4) animals with and without intelligence.38 In its native British setting, Darwin's concern over the materialistic implications of his theory was natural given the heated polemic associated with the pioneering neurophysiological work of William Lawrence.39 But the label is much less interesting than the details of the struggle he wages to come to grips with the implications of a theory implying the</page><page sequence="18">598 Social Studies of Science evolution of mental phenomena. He rejected the familiar move espoused by Dugald Stewart, and reiterated by Hensleigh Wedgwood: mental and physical phenomena are ontologically distinct because we have distinct means of observing them - for example introspection and sensation, respectively.40 Darwin thought the distinction of 'inner' and 'outer' awareness lacked metaphysical significance. It certainly did not justify a negative answer to the question, 'Does the brain think?' Since he did not think of organisms as pieces of clockwork, however, his perspec- tive blurred the contrast between mental and physical phenomena. The Cartesian dichotomy of mind and matter meant little or nothing when the processes of sexual fertilization, heredity, embryological development and digestion were as paradigmatically 'material' as any- thing associated with inertial motion or simple machinery. Moreover, he followed J. F. W. Herschel in mingling psychological evidence concerning volition with the explication of the concept of force in physics.41 In general, his insistence that every human capacity had developed within the process of evolution by natural selection shifted the meaning of 'matter' in the direction charted by Hartley, Priestley and Erasmus Darwin in the eighteenth century: (a) interpreting matter as a centre of force and activity; (b) insisting that all thought could be given bodily expression; and (c) holding that all the higher powers of human beings had been generated from the social instincts found in lower animals. This was the context within which Charles Darwin could say, 'The brain thinks' and 'The brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile' .42 Social Instincts and Moral Sentiments Darwin's dedication to the task of providing an adequate scientific explanation of the origin of 'intellectual man' led him to trace the 'higher' emotions (for instance, love) to an evolutionary ancestry in the social instincts of animals. He freely used both moral language (such as 'obligation' and 'ought') and mentalist language (such as 'recognition' and 'pleasure') in describing patterns of animal behaviour. An ontology of socially structured groups of organisms is in the background of everything he said about instincts and sentiments. He regarded sexual reproduction as necessary for significant evolutionary change.43 The unit of evolution was a group of organisms related by the capacity of its members to contribute to the next generation through the process of sexual crossing. Such populations might be comprised of plants or the</page><page sequence="19">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 599 simplest proto-organisms exhibiting no social behaviour and yet be really structured as groups because of the processes of sexual recombina- tion. Only if populations of interbreeding organisms were the units of evolutionary change could variations occurring in some fraction of a population be tested against its complete environmental range. The rate of change would be slow, but the population as a whole would be less vulnerable to extinction. His use of the Benthamist expression 'law of utility' has to be read carefully against the background of his own assimilation of Mackintosh's history of ethical thought. Law of utility. Nothing but that which has beneficial tendency through many ages could be acquired, and we are certain from our reason, that which (as we must admit) has been acquired does possess the beneficial tendency.44 'Beneficial tendency' referred either to the prospects of leaving fertile progeny or to an advantage, measured only retrospectively, to 'the whole past race'. For Darwin, the law of utility simply provided a sanction for behaviour which had determined the survival of a sub- population whose size and structure were adequate to ensure evolutionary continuity. He found important links between the phenomenon of sexual dif- ferentiation and the social instincts of animals, and between the social instincts and 'all that is most beautiful in the moral sentiments of animated beings'.45 Universal feelings of right and wrong were natural consequences of 'man, like deer, etc., being a social animal'. Since 'friendship' among animals in a social flock was 'necessary for long generation', it was good and in some sense obligatory, and a sense of pleasure would evolve in association with such action. Human religious sensibility could develop in the same way. May not moral sense arise from our enlarged capacity/yet being obscurely guided/ (acting) on strong instinctive sexual, parental, and social instincts, giving rise 'do unto others as yourself', 'love thy neighbour as thyself'. Analyse this out, bearing in mind many new relations from language. The social instinct more than mere love, fear for others, acting in unison - active assistance, etc., etc.? May not idea of God arise from our confused idea of 'ought', joined with necessary notion of 'causation', in reference to this 'ought', as well as the works of the whole world?46 Towards the close of Notebook N Darwin connected the sense of beauty with the need to identify and communicate with those to whom the social bond was particularly strong.</page><page sequence="20">600 Social Studies of Science Does music bear any relation to the period when men communicated before language was invented - were musical notes the language of passion and hence does music now excite our feelings? How does social animal recognize/ and take pleasure in other animals? (especially as in some insects which become in imago state social) by smell or looks, but it does not know its own smell or looks, and therefore there must be some instinctive feeling which is pleased by other animals smell and looks - no doubt it may be attempted to be said that young animal learns parent smell and look and so by association receives pleasure. This will not do for insects - if this view holds good, then man, a socialist does not know other men by smell, but by looks hence some obscure picture of other men, and hence idea of beauty.47 This theme was reiterated in the Sketch of 1842 and then developed in the Essay of 1844 to the extent that sexual struggle was seen to play a role equal to that of the struggle for life itself. This is more than adequate evidence of his increasing confidence in a basically monistic view of the relation of mind and nature, and in the general adequacy of the metaphor of 'struggle' to express the wide range of selective forces covered by his theory. On 12 March 1839 Darwin wrote in Transmutation Notebook E that 'it is difficult to believe in the dreadful but quiet war of organic beings, going on [in] the peaceful woods and smiling fields'. 48 Somewhat later in the spring of that same year, he wrote a ten-page manuscript com- mentary on a Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy, Chiefly during the 17th and 18th Centuries, written by the famous barrister, philosophical disciple of Dugald Stewart and admirer of the non- individualist social ethic of Bishop Butler, Sir James Mackintosh.49 This manuscript stressed the foundation of man's sense of right and wrong in several social instincts which consisted of a 'feeling of love and sympathy or benevolence' to the object in question. There was no indication that Darwin perceived any incompatibility or tension between the uses of 'war' in his theory of the transmutation of species and the centrality of 'love' in his ethics. The manuscript admitted that man was the last in a series of animals in which instincts were increasingly less determinative of behaviour, but it also took the evolution of human behaviour from 'parental, conjugal, and social instincts' as a basic premise. Darwin asserted that these instincts involved the animal 'in such active sympathy that the individual forgets itself, and aids and defends and acts for others at its own expense'. He also stipulated, without further analysis of the evolutionary significance of pleasure and pain, that action in (accordance to an instinct gives great pleasure, and such actions being prevented by (necessarily) some force give pain'. Moral approbation or</page><page sequence="21">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 601 disapprobation of others was attributed to associated experiences of pleasure and pain contingent upon their conformity or nonconformity to these same instinctive patterns. Darwin was confident that Mackintosh's account could be adapted to demonstrate that his own system was not selfish.50 Darwin's Dialectical Relationship with his Cultural Circle Darwin's cultural circle included individuals with highly diverse and often opposed positions concerning all the fundamental methodological and cultural issues raised by his theory. In 1838 his central hypothesis concerning the transmutation of species was at odds with the views of Lyell and Cuvier on the same subject. His work did not conform to the methodological standards of Herschel and Whewell.5' In practice he combined the views of Herschel and Whewell with the conflicting positions of Auguste Comte, Dugald Stewart, Charles Lyell and William Paley. He did not accept any of the prevailing views concerning the scientific investigations of man's 'higher' powers. He rejected the dualism of mind and body represented by Hensleigh Wedgwood, and infected his own materialistic monism with animistic and anthropomorphic themes in flat contradiction to the mechanistic tradition of Descartes and Boyle. He developed an ethical position which subtly modified the individualism dominating British ethical and political thought. His religious views were neither deistic, positivist nor agnostic. His methodology, metaphysics and ethics were an original, dialectical advance over those of each member of his cultural circle, as well as any consensus that might have been ascribed to that circle apart from his membership in it. Looking back at the practice of the young Darwin, we find a scientist who combined the various ideologies of his day in a fashion partially liberating him from slavish attachment to any one of them, and enabling him to construct a new synthesis offering a strong but flexible foundation for the human sciences. Regardless of the uses to which his theory was put by those who followed him, and in his own scientific practice during almost forty more active years, the archival record clearly shows that, during the time he was first articulating his theory, Darwin constructed an original philosophy of scientific practice not limited by the dominant ideology of his day. His construction and dialectical interpretation of the works of various members of his cultural circle enabled him to overcome the ideological obstacles to the development of his theory and to transform the biological and human sciences, causing the old cultural</page><page sequence="22">602 Social Studies of Science 'fabric to totter and fall' [Darwin's expression], replacing it with a new vision of man's relation to nature, and to other men in society.52 Darwin assembled and actively considered an unusually rich and diverse array of ideological positions in the development of his own views. He not only considered a wide variety of opposed biological, geological and philosophical views, but his cultural circle included cosmologists, agriculturalists, physicians, lawyers, political economists, philologists, novelists, poets, physiognomists and painters, a group whose structure and thought I have discussed elsewhere.53 I would argue that the tension resulting from his vigorous consideration of this full range of dialectically opposed ideological alternatives must be analyzed if we are to understand the motivation and structure of Darwin's continuing scientific inquiries. Expository Strategies and the Development of New Fields of Scientific Inquiry Michel Cloitre and Terry Shinn have recently argued that, in the general case, there is no clear line of demarcation between specialized scientific texts and mere popularizations of science for a lay public.54 Instead, they find an expository continuum linking different sorts of texts intended for a graded series of increasingly different sorts of audiences: specialist texts addressed to audiences using similar methods to investigate similar topics; inter-specialist texts communicating the problems and findings of a particular research area to an audience made up of specialized experts in related areas; pedagogical texts intended to provide basic instruction concerning the techniques, background theories and current problems of a field for students, grant administrator or funding officers; populariza- tions intended to inform either scientists or non-scientists of recent discoveries against a background of non-scientific interests and concerns. Cloitre and Shinn have also argued that since the process of transferring knowledge from one expository frame to another can cast light on its strengths and weaknesses, expository practices themselves play a significant role in the production and testing of new knowledge. The archival material considered in this paper not only confirms the Cloitre-Shinn continuity thesis, it displays an even more intricate weaving together of specialist, inter-specialist, pedagogical and popularizing goals and achievements. While Darwin had projected a three-volume, specialist version of his transmutation theory, the reception of A. R. Wallace's sketch of a similar view spurred the publication of The Origin of Species.</page><page sequence="23">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 603 The Origin, in ways which I have analyzed elsewhere, was dominated by the metaphorical presentation of its key concepts in a carefully orches- trated ensemble of terms and related phrases - 'selection', 'struggle', '.wedge', 'chance', 'tree', 'coral', 'contrivance' and 'economy' ." While these expressions came under rather heavy positivist criticism at the time, Darwin persisted in their use, and there is more than adequate evidence to the effect that he would have employed them in the full three-volume account of his theory, if that had ever been published.56 In his hands they functioned as a highly 'graphic' means of verbal communication, in effect communicating graded series of ideas whose unity was too important to the theory to permit their expression in completely separate, rigidly defined terms from a technical vocabulary. Since Darwin under- stood himself, in effect, to be creating both a new field and the audience or community of scientists who would judge work in that field, he could not possibly have relied on such a technical vocabulary. Joske Bunders and Richard Whitley have commented on the role of metaphors in inter-specialist communication.5 But they emphasize the difficulties of interpretation metaphors can present outside the special field in which they have originally been developed. Specialists often need to translate their ideas and results into the languages of other specialties so that they can gain assistance from members of those specialties in the resolution of their problems. Neurophysiologists, for example, need the assistance of endocrinologists, pharmacologists, electron microscopists and so on. Therefore they need the translating skills required to transcend specialist boundaries and clarify the 'dominant metaphors used to express the central concepts of their field'. Shinn, Whitley and their co-workers are right to note the importance of the variability of expository practice in science as a function of a continuum of graded differences in the types of audience to be addressed, and to insist that this continuum undermines claims concerning the strict demarcation of scientific and non-scientific texts. These implications of their work, moreover, provide a welcome context within which to reflect upon the Darwin case. Nevertheless, there are aspects of that case which raise important questions not dealt with by this group. First, the Darwin case permits the critical, analytic comparison of a massive and comprehensive unpublished personal archive with the scientist's published work. In spite of Darwin's close and supportive relationships with a 'few eminent men of science', the pre-publication assembly and organization of information supporting his transmutation theory was for the most part a personal, almost private, affair rather than a public, co-operative enterprise. The Darwin papers provide an unusual opportunity to watch</page><page sequence="24">604 Social Studies of Science an individual develop his ideas and decide how to present them so as to attract the requisite numbers of co-workers to what he hoped would become a common enterprise. Those decisions, at times, involved methodological and conceptual compromises of the sort analyzed in the second section of this paper. The published texts, as a result, can only be effectively interpreted against the background of the personal archive. To the extent that the published texts contribute to the appearance of a gradual internalization of factors lending greater autonomy to future developments of evolutionary theory, that appearance cannot be properly assessed in the absence of the careful analysis of its social construction which the personal archive makes possible. Second, since many of Darwin's methodological and conceptual innovations, to say nothing of the cultural implications of those innova- tions, were at odds with major features of the dominant (scientific and cultural) consensus of the day, his expository practice had to achieve effective communication and persuasion while minimizing the risk of outright rejection. In this and similar contexts, metaphorical expression which insinuates and persuasively implies what it does not directly state can be an important tool for inter-specialist communication. Darwin's use of the metaphor of 'selection', for example, invoked the familiar (technological) imagery of animal husbandry and horticulture in a way which Darwin hoped would soften the bold challenge the theory offered to traditional views concerning the origin of species. But the metaphor of 'selection' was more than the popularizing fiction this might suggest. The analogy with artificial selection effectively represented the wide variety of internal and external properties of organisms effecting their chances for survival, mating and leaving fertile progeny. Darwin's use of this imagery infuriated his critics, of course, much as Thomas Kuhn's uses of 'revolution', 'paradigm' and the like provide grist for philosophers' mills today. But in the Darwin case, at least, such metaphorical expression played a major role in the gradual construction of a new field of scientific inquiry and the assembly of an appropriate community of specialists to pursue it.58 Conclusions Although 'external factors' and 'ideology', as the terms are ordinarily used in science studies, refer to a broad array of entities, forces and processes, including social power used to acquire the material resources required for scientific investigation, its primary use in this paper has</page><page sequence="25">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 605 been to refer to particular sorts of information. Here it refers simply to information accepted by one or more scientists in a given domain or field of inquiry, even though the information is not and could not be subject to methodological criteria consensually agreed upon by the scientific community investigating the domain or field in question. The earliest drafts of Darwin's theory of the transmutation of species reflect an effort to construct a new field of inquiry from previously disparate types of information (from geology and palaeontology, biogeography, comparative anatomy and embryology, political economy, linguistics and so on). This information included both evidence, problems, goals of inquiry and standards of adequacy. Darwin assembled it at a point in history when the leading commentators on scientific method (for example Kant, Comte, Whewell, Herschel) held views which could not readily be invoked in support of a theory which required the reconstruction of long series of past events, which could not be supported by experimental evidence or confirmed by successful predictions of future events, which could not be expressed with mathematical precision or rigour, and whose central theses were probabilistic in form and required statistical inference for their elaboration. Since the theory, from its inception, was also conceived as transforming the human sciences, and offering a naturalistic explanation of the origins of humanity and of the 'higher powers' of reason and moral and aesthetic sensibility, Darwin had to anticipate serious dissent from his views concerning the biological foundations of consciousness. Since Darwin's task was the formation of a new field of inquiry and the assembly of a new community of competent investigators, the earliest drafts of his theory could only have been heavily investigative practices, reflected in personal and unpublished elements of the Darwin archive, and the identifiable criteria and methodological standards of any available jury of competent critics led to the formation of an expository strategy which, although it had serious logical flaws, was highly effective in opening up a new field of inquiry.59 * NOTES 1.

I am most certainly not suggesting that a highly specialized, technical, systematic, rigorously mathematical version of The Origin should, or could possibly have been, published</page><page sequence="29">Manier: 'External Factors', 'Ideology' &amp; Darwin 609 in 1859. Nor do I mean to say or imply that Darwin lacked a proper understanding of scientific method, or that his expository practice fell short of standards to be expected of scientific specialists. In my view his understanding of the appropriate methodology for a biological theory of evolution was superior to that of contemporary (1830-70) philosophical critics of science, and his expository practice was suited to both its scientific and cultural audiences. 59. These issues are also discussed in E. Manier, 'History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Biology: A Family Romance', Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, Vol. 11 (1980), 1-24, and 'Levels of Reflexivity: Unnoted Differences within the "Strong Programme" in the Sociology of Knowledge', in P.

Edward Manier is Associate Professor of Philosophy in the Program for History and Philosophy of Science, University of Notre Dame. He has published several studies of the social and cultural context of the earliest drafts of Charles Darwin's theory of the transmutation of species, with early encouragement and inspiration from Robert M. Young and his friends, and financial support from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The National Science Foundation supports his current project on the relationship of cognitive and cell biological analyses of associative learning.
