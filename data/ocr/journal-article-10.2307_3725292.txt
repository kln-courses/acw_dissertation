<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNAMUNO-BERGSON: A RECONSIDERATION An appreciable number of critics have noted the grounds for comparison between Unamuno and Bergson. To the conclusions of Julian Marias, Miguel Cruz Hernandez and Francois Meyer about the similarities in the two men's basic outlook little remains to be added, but the comments of Blanco Aguinaga and Ronald Batchelor on the affinities between the theories of duree and intrahistoria may serve as a useful starting point for further discussion.1 Born within five years of one another, Henri Bergson and Miguel de Unamuno both grew up in an intellectual atmosphere dominated by traditional Catholicism and neo-Hegelian idealism, Comtian positivism and evolutionist historicism.2 It is primarily on the question of history that our attention must focus. In the later nineteenth century a radical revaluation of objective time took place. Henceforth history would be conceived of as something dynamic and developmental, to the detriment of the previously held belief in what Stephen Toulmin has termed 'the static framework of the natural world'.3 Bergson himself comments precisely on this revolution in man's thought: 'Our physics differs from that of the ancients chiefly in the breaking up of time' and 'must be defined pre-eminently by its aspiration to take time as an independent variable' (pp. 350, 355). The views of time and history held by Unamuno and Bergson must consequently be seen in the broader context of those held by such figures as Hegel, Schopenhauer, Darwin, and Marx. The theories of duree and intrahistoria were both conceived as an intellectual and spiritual response to the total revolution in nineteenth-century thought of which the re-appraisal of time formed part. Two reservations, however, must be made. Firstly, Unamuno's contemplative creed, from which the vision of intrahistoria derives, is ultimately inseparable from the complementary 'agonic' tendency to interpret reality in religious and metaphysical terms. On the other hand, as Andre Robinet remarks, 'Rien n'est plus etranger au philosophe, selon Bergson, que l'angoisse metaphysique'.4 There is a fundamental difference in outlook which will condition the way in which both thinkers interpret particular questions. Secondly, by choosing to compare Unamuno's theory of intrahistoria with Bergson's system of duree we automatically limit the discussion of his idea of historia. Bergson's all- inclusive theory of time will in fact be compared to only half of Unamuno's corresponding theory. Some marked similarities may be detected between the two men's theories of objective time. Both thinkers refer to the absolute status of an evolving temporal structure in the world. Historical and scientific theory may be said to conceive of the variations inherent in the world process in mechanistic and divisive terms, 1 J. Marias, Miguel de Unamuno (Madrid, I943); M.

In their respective philo- sophies, Bergson and Unamuno look beyond the external, quantitative framework of temporal reality and argue, instead, for the recognition of internal, qualitative structures of society, humanity, and the universe in which a principle of unitary or organic continuity is to be found embodied. For Bergson, time is not the Newtonian context in which an event occurs but it is that very occurrence in the process of becoming. Around this notion of time he constructs a whole cosmology and asserts that 'The Universe endures' (p. I I). Duration, or the cosmic elan vital, is the essen- tial characteristic of 'the evolutionary phenomena which properly constitute life' (p. 2I). Unamuno likewise states that the 'vida intra-hist6rica' is a continuous process, an autonomous 'hacerse' and an 'armonia siempre in fieri' (III, I9I). A number of passages in Paz en la guerra express the idea of a life-force inherent in natural phenomena. Pachico looks down from a mountain summit and reflects on 'el elemento nivelador e igualitario, el que recorre, como el mercader que lo surca, las tierras todas, vivo porque en su seno recobran el calor del Ecuador y el hielo del Polo...' (II, 413). The notions of 'la trama continua de la vida de cada dia' (p. 261) and 'la vida ordinaria, tejiendo en su lento telar su infinita trama' (p. 251) appear frequently in the novel and exemplify Unamuno's concept of continuous world activity analogous with Bergson's principle of 'creation unceasingly renewed' (p. o18). The time of which this force is the embodiment is not susceptible to definition by arbitrary, 'spatial' criteria. That realm of time which is generally denoted 'past', for example, is a permanent and living reality in both duree and intrahistoria. Bergson's assertion that 'duration is the continuous progress of the past which gnaws into the future and which swells as it advances' (p. 5) is complemented by the casticista's sense of the present as 'un momento de la serie toda del pasado' (III, I96), and by Pachico's intuition of'el curso perdurable de las aguas profundas, en corro sin cesar recomenzado' (II, 36I). Time is seen not as a sequence of three separate categories but as a synthetic, continuous present which is the sole basis of reality. Timelessness rather than time, therefore, is the essence of both durde and intrahistoria. The ideas of activity and motion are central to Bergson's philosophy of time. The foregoing interpretation of intrahistoria as continuous cosmic dynamism has revealed two main bases for comparison between the two theories. There is, however, another tendency in the contemplative Unamuno, which is to seek in intrahistoric reality a realm of stability and permanence. Some key differences between the philosophies of intrahistoria and duree derive from this fact. In short, duree is dynamic, extended motion whereas intrahistoria is a paradoxical blend of stasis and motion in a depth dimension. Bergson refuses to admit any ele- ment of stasis in the cosmic impetus and insists on the creative process of duration. Sherman Eoff has pin-pointed the distinction between the two thinkers' appraisal of motion in his observation that in Unamuno's theory 'eternity is better under- stood as durability than as duration'.1 Unamunian quality is thus opposed to Bergsonian process. The mobility of intrahistoria is complemented by a quality of stability. The eternity of that system is perceived as both 'continuo' and 'inm6vil', 'perdurable' and 'invariable', 'incesante' and 'permanente'. The 'tiempo detenido' 1 S.

FIDDIAN 789 may be 'lento' or 'manso' in a synthetic 'pasajera eternidad' (Paz en la guerra, p. 324 and passim). The reason for the opposition between Bergson's uncompromising dynamism and Unamuno's admission of heterogeneous qualities in intrahistoria may be uncovered by examining the dichotomies of essence-appearance, substance-form and quality- quantity in the two philosophies. Unamuno's contemplative vision of intrahistoria may be considered, in general terms, as a re-statement of the Platonic philosophy of Ideas. He states that the substance of history lies beyond or within the form of time (III, I84) and that it is essential, qualitative, and permanent.l This idea of static permanence is certainly contrary to Bergson's principle of the unconditional activity of life. Although the French philosopher asserts that the quality of dure underlies the quantity of scientific time, he adds that that quality itself is creative movement. Similarly, he recognizes the permanence of the past, but only as an organic component of the living present. Unamuno separates the essences from an evolving temporal framework and places them in a hypothetical, pure and static realm of infinite space-time. Two passages from En torno alcasticismo and 'Nicodemo el fariseo' express Unamuno's idea that eternity is actually the substance of the present historical moment: 'Asi como la tradici6n es la sustancia de la historia, la eternidad lo es del tiempo, la historia es la forma de la tradici6n como el tiempo la de la eternidad', and that in that pure realm are to be found 'las verdades eternas de la eterna esencia' (III, I84). Unamuno chides Hegel for not recognizing the fact that 'si dentro de las formas se halla la cantidad, dentro de esta hay una cualidad, lo intra-cuantitativo, el quid divinum' (p. i 80). A later article, 'El tiempo vacio' (192 I), which may be considered chronologically independent of the theory of intrahistoria, reiterates this point. Unamuno revives the Platonic argument of correspondences which Bergson had so earnestly questioned. 'dNo te has asomado nunca a la sima eterna', the narrator inquires of the reader, 'del manana que es manana siempre ? iNo has tocado con la contera de tu animo el fondo inm6vil del tiempo, en el lecho sobre que va la correinte? dNo has probado el sabor del tiempo vacio?' This eternity or void lies 'detras de este cielo' in which, Unamuno claims, 'la pellcula celeste, toda de una pieza, juntos pasado, presente y porvenir' is to be perceived (v, 1024). Such oppositions of the concrete and abstract are a fundamental com- ponent of Unamuno's contemplative doctrine. Nowhere does Bergson undertake this inquiry into the nature of a transcendental, 'noumenal' reality; in fact, he frowned upon metaphysics untempered by pragmatic reason and would have objected as a matter of course to Unamuno's declaration that 'Hay que buscar lo eterno en el aluvi6n de lo insignificante, de lo inorgdnico' (III, I87). This leads on to the question of the relation between cosmic mind, or spirit, and matter. Bergson denies mechanistic dualism, Platonic and Newtonian alike. He opposes the organic and the inorganic in principle but contends that when they are seen in a perspective of duration which focuses on the universe's internal process of becoming, the two, spirit and matter, are to be perceived as joined in a process of interaction and conflict from which there will be no solution. 'Life ... is a tendency 1 Unamuno might well have replaced the word 'sustancia' by a neologism intra-stancia*; for the principal point of interest resides in the fact that the Latin root 'stans' is linked in content and form to the word 'static': 'substance' is that which 'stands below', in a realm of immutability in which the Kantian noumena might also be located.</page><page sequence="4">Unamuno-Bergson: A Reconsideration to act on inert matter' (p. 102), but at the same time 'there is, in reality, only a current of existence and the opposing current; thence proceeds the whole evolution of life' (p. 196). The force/matter dichotomy resolves itself into a simple principle of like versus like, of movement of one grade versus movement of another, less- developed grade. Bergson concludes that '[Life] is the continuation of one and the same impetus, divided into divergent lines of evolution' (p. 56), and thereby defines his own brand of monism sub specie durationis, according to which form and substance, and time and eternity are one; Gilles Deleuze has referred to this as 'un monisme du Temps'.l The dynamic interaction between the organic life-force and theoretically inorganic matter is absent in Unamuno's essentialist theory. Whilst the dynamic intrahistoricist believes in the organism of intrareality, the quietist enthusiast of intrahistoria proposes a parallelist conception of two levels of reality reminiscent of Eastern and Greek philosophy. The narrator of 'Plenitud' (III, 753-70), describes the substantial world of intrahistoria: 'es un mundo en que no hay pasajeras formas de materia y fuerza persistentes, sino que todo lo que ha sido sigue siendo tal como fue, y es como sera todo lo que ha de ser. Y ese es el verdadero mundo sustancial' (p. 757). The true nature of this mysterious, sacred world can only be appreciated through a contrast with its analogue, 'el mundo ... aparencial o fenom6nico' of history. The formal, extensive and transient nature of history is thus complemented and relegated to an inferior category by the substantial, intensive and permanent qualities of intrahistoria viewed sub specie aeternitatis. This idea is close to the Platonic definition of time as 'a moving image of eternity'2 and illus- trates a basically dualistic conception of the world. A fundamental point of divergence between the theories of duree and intrahistoria thus emerges. Bergsonian monism may ultimately be distinguished from Una- munian dualism, whether dynamic or quietist; for, in the first case, the current of intrahistoria flows beneath the surface of transient externals, and in the second the realm of essences remains static but still within the supra-structure of temporal matter. Whereas Bergson discarded any system of quantitative time, Unamuno recognizes history as a necessary factor which serves to counterpoint the reality of intrahistoria. The synthesis of one system thereby differs from the antithesis of the other. From this study of the structure of intrahistoria and duree we may proceed to examine the human implications of both theories. Neither of these cosmic forces exists solely in a pure state. They acquire their fullest significance when applied to the dialectic of human history. For Unamuno the real present is precisely the tradition of history. Viewed from a perspective of dynamism, intrahistoria moves in the direction of a humanitarian goal, a Utopian state of peace consonant with a left-wing political ethic whose concern is the reconciliation of mankind in a fraternal, egalitarian structure. After quoting Rousseau in the second essay of En torno al casticismo, Unamuno proposes that 'hay en formaci6n, tal vez inacabable, un pacto inmanente, un verdadero contrato social intra-historico...', and the narrator in Paz en la guerra muses on 'la atracci6n que, sintiendo los pueblos hacia la vida silenciosa de debajo del tumulto pasajero de la historia, los empuja a su 1 G.

FIDDIAN 79I distribucion natural... , a la redistribucion que permita el futuro libre de agrupamiento de todos ellos en la gran familia humana'. He concludes that the ethnic currents beneath the surface of history tend towards 'el concierto de que haya de surgir la humanidad pacifica' (II, 405).1 The humanized historical principle also appears, though in less passionate and emphatic form, in Bergson's work. 'The whole of humanity', he writes vigorously, 'is one immense army galloping beside, before and behind each of us . .' (p. 286), and he believes that 'the enterprise [of life] is necessarily collective and progressive' (p. 202). In the second of two lectures delivered in the Ateneo, Madrid, on 6 May 9 i6,2 Bergson discussed the theme of the intimate personality of nations, the super- personality, that is, which transcends purely pragmatic, political factors. There appears to be a similarity between this idea and those expressed by Unamuno in the idealistic Hegelian passages of En torno al casticismo and Paz en la guerra. Bergson, however, had rejected the theses of Hegel and Marx (in his critique of radical finalism), and the basis may be perceived here of a contrast between his and Unamuno's concept of a developing structure of history. At the root of this divergence is a widely differing evaluation of the nature of consciousness in the organism of the universe. This will in turn affect the respective attitudes to the subjects of teleology, transcendence, and God. Duration is conceived of as a form of universal macro-consciousness (p. 275), but Bergson insists that this is not to be confused with a form of pure intellect. The consciousness of duree comprises an amalgam of intellect and instinct in which the latter predominates; it is a consciousness which, according to Bergson, must be seen as functioning beyond the limits of mind and as one which 'tends' without 'intending'. Tendency, creation and 'an immensity of potentiality' (p. 272) are the fundamentals of cosmic duree. But if 'before the evolution of life the portals of the future remain wide open' (p. I Io), towards what does duree tend and what is its eventual object of creation? 'The role of life is to insert some indetermination into matter', states Bergson (p. 132). He also argues that 'Progress does not require the conscious or uncon- scious idea of an end to be attained' (p. 102) and consequently rejects a teleological view of history. Admitting that his theory 'will ... necessarily partake of finalism to a certain extent', Bergson insists that his philosophy 'claims to transcend both mechanism and finalism' (pp. 42, 53). Within a scheme of organic duration, any notion of purpose or concept of finality 'charged with anthropomorphic elements' (p. 62) would violate the essential spontaneity and consistent impetus of the world process. The vital supra-consciousness surges onwards, but without the 'technique of forward dreaming'3 which George Steiner, for example, regards as a prerequisite for any theory of history or culture. Bergson's notion of consciousness, while intended 1 F.

'Consciousness is essentially forward-reaching in its nature', argued G. W. Cunningham in a study of Bergson published in I916.1 The truncated consciousness of duree appears in effect to be not only un-conscious but even a-conscious in this respect. Anxious to defend the principle of freedom inherent in his doctrine, Bergson insists that such a theory does not preclude the possibility of transcendence; the reader is urged 'to see in time a progressive growth of the absolute' and to appreci- ate that 'a self-sufficient reality is not necessarily a reality foreign to duration' (pp. 364, 314). But that same reader who cannot make the French philosopher's 'leap of faith' into the metaphysical realm of duration itself may find it difficult to accept his vision of an evolving harmonious whole which nevertheless 'remains inadequate to the work it would fain produce' (p. I32). Sherman Eoff's criticism that 'Bergson's creative advance can justifiably be considered a restless and futile activity moving toward an eternal sameness'2 remains valid. There are also potentially sinister implications, since the anthropomorphic element in the organism of the world is seriously threatened; duree in the end takes on the foreboding aspect of an impersonal transcendent power analogous to a variety of Schopenhaurian Will. Man's position in this cosmic scheme is distinctly vulner- able. 'We are not the vital current itself; we are this current already loaded with matter', Bergson states (p. 252), in a detached and clinical fashion whose determin- istic spirit is reflected in the dehumanizing vocabulary. In spite of his cursory affirmations of a collective, political dimension in world duree, the general tone of Bergson's early works and the thematic insistence on the scientific aspects of his cosmology detracts considerably from its direct human value. It seems that Bergson subordinates mankind to an evolutionary force more instinctive than rational and more objective than personal. This throws some interesting light on his notion of God. Bergson made little attempt to incorporate the idea of God into his system until his late work Deux sources de la morale et de la religion (1932). The sceptic would be entitled to regard this as an eleventh-hour inclusion or merely as an afterthought. Bergson, in fact, appears to have been at pains to reconcile his theory and Christian doctrine. In Creative Evolution he makes only one reference to God, contrasting his interpretation of him with the Aristotelian and Platonic concept of an immutable Supreme Being 'apart from what is happening in the world' (p. 339). Bergson's own God is 'unceasing life, action, freedom' (p. 262). Equally unorthodox is the hypothesis of God as the causa prima that Bergson offered in the Ateneo lecture: 'En el origen, pues, un gran artista creador del mundo, y luego, al cabo, deseados por el, otros pequenos artistas que continuian su obra y son tambien creadores; por un largo proceso en torno a la materia organica, cada dia mas d6cil y maleable, continuan 1 G.

For a different point of view see Angele Marietti, 'Une ideologie bergsonienne ?', Les ttudes Bergsoniennes, 9 (1970), 209 et seq. Miss Marietti recognizes that 'On chercherait en vain, en effet, l'optimisme dialectique du Savoir Absolu hegelien ou celui de la societe libre marxiste: ce que Bergson propose donc c'est l'Action permanente, cr6atrice d'une societe deliberement ouverte...' (p. 2Io). 792</page><page sequence="7">R. W. FIDDIAN 793 ellos la obra de la creaci6n divina'.1 Clearly, Bergson's raising of the elan vital to the status of an impersonal, supra-conscious absolute is incongruous with the ideas of Christian dualism and finality. The concepts of divine control and purpose are both rejected or at least undermined by a theory which claims that Creation is not an established datum subject to external control but a continuous autonomous process.2 Certain key differences between these and Unamuno's conclusions about con- sciousness and God prove to be ultimately beyond reconciliation. Unamuno emphatically insists on the human intention in intrahistoria. For example, he draws attention to the role of 'los silenciosos', the underprivileged intrahistoric folk whom he depicted with such sympathy in Paz en la guerra (pp. I49-63). The contemplative Unamuno identifies himself with their 'anhelo espiritual' and, in Hegelian fashion, he attributes a corresponding measure of importance to the conscious or sub- conscious anthropomorphic element in history. Whilst agreeing with Bergson that the collective ideal and liberal vision ought to be 'mas sentido que pensado' (III, 299), he still considers it to be of the nature of consciousness. He describes the Revolution of 1868 as 'un irrumpir de lo subconciente en la conciencia, de lo intra-hist6rico en la historia' (III, 302). The reality of the intrahistoric process is referred to also as 'lo inconciente en la historia' (III, I85). But to say that it is subconscious or uncon- scious is not to deny its quality of mind, nor does it constitute a refutation of the purposive faculty of that mind. The prospective, conscious sense of intrahistoria is nearer than Bergsonian theory to that Western tradition of teleology which derives from ancient Christian and Hebrew doctrine and reaches its climax in nineteenth- century historicism.3 The status of the future in Unamuno's theory is in a number of cases analogous with the value accorded it in Bergson's scheme. In 1895 he had already stated that 'El universo todo es un tejido de hechos en el mar de lo indistinto e indeterminado' (my stress) (III, 220). In an article entitled 'Sobre la continuidad hist6rica' (1913) (vIII, 474-81), he described the unrestricted nature of life's fundamental tendency, emphasizing at the same time the inadequacy of moulding an historical vision of the future according to preconceptions deriving from acquired experience. Unamuno also claimed that the 'pacto inmanente' of intrahistoric social reality is 'en formaci6n, tal vez inacabable' in an open-ended scheme of development. 'La doctrina del pacto ... es la que ... presenta la raz6n intra-hist6rica de la patria, su verdadera fuerza creadora, en acci6n siempre' (III, I98). This continuous creative 'pact', situated within the 'presente total intra-hist6rico', constitutes an immanent plenitude to which a Bergsonian parallel can again be found. These parallels, however, would have to be qualified in the light of the foregoing conclusions about the nature of world consciousness. In addition to the idea of immanent fulfilment there appears in Unamuno's creed an orthodox notion of transcendence deriving from his experience of God. 1 'Bergson en Espagne', p. 108. 2 Joseph de Tonquedec concludes that Bergson's God, seen as ''Absolu en perpetuel devenir', 'n'est certainement pas le Dieu chretien' ('La conception bergsonienne de Dieu', Bulletin de la Societe Franfaise de Philosophie, 53 (1959), 303-6). 3 Dr J. W. Butt interprets the role of human consciousness in Unamuno's philosophy of history in deterministic and negative terms in his important article 'Unamuno's idea of intrahistoria; its origins and significance', in Studies in Modern Spanish Literature and Art presented to Helen F. Grant, edited by Nigel Glendinning (London, 1972), pp. I3-24.</page><page sequence="8">Unamuno-Bergson: A Reconsideration This is not to be found in Bergson's work. Unamuno conceived an a lo divino version of his theory in addition to the view of intrahistoria as a secular process. His is a more convincing idea of God which accommodates the considerations of consciousness and teleology that Bergson chose to disregard. Secular teleology and Christian eschatology combine in the intrahistoric creed. Unamuno postulates a supreme, ulterior Conciencia. In his semi-pantheistic, semi-Christian vision, Pachico 'recordaba al Espiritu de Dios incubando sobre las aguas, y se fingla que de un momento a otro apareciese en augusta sombra el Omnipotente Anciano . . .' (II, 358). The divine Spirit inherent in intrahistoria is dynamic, as Jesus indicates when he tells Nicodemus that man must communicate 'con Dios que habita en todo y todo lo vivifica' (III, I34). Nicodemus is advised to look for 'la eternidad viva sustentando el movimiento actual... en Dios para quien ayer y mafiana son siempre hoy' (pp. 130-I). Intrahistoric time and reality thus constitute a plenitude which is not virtual, as that of duree might be interpreted, but real as a result of the fulfilment of purpose in a temporal depth-dimension. The infinitely open-ended universe con- ceived by Bergson now proves incompatible with an eternal, permanent state of plenitude similar to a closed circle and metaphorically represented as God's dream. Whereas potential is being inadequately realized in an aimless fashion in the 'devenir perpetuel' of duree, purpose has been fulfilled in the durability of intrahistoria. The dilemmas of teleology and transcendence which Bergson left unresolved acquire satisfactory solution in Unamuno's a lo divino creed. The agonizing problem ' iCual es el fin del universo entero?' (III, 124) is overcome in a realm where the question of direction, in the sense of extension, is immaterial. Whilst duree is onward- going, intrahistoria is directed inwards to infinite depths. Purpose and finality are only applicable within time but eternity, the timeless essence, transcends, or 'intra-scends', these properties of cosmic activity. In conclusion, Unamuno's and Bergson's theories of objective time coincide on two accounts. Both thinkers postulate the existence of an autonomous creative force which is the embodiment of time; the rejection of scientific or mathematical dogma leads both Unamuno and Bergson to assert the prevalence of synthetic timelessness over temporal discontinuity. Some differences derive from a quietist version of Unamuno's creed. The peculiar blend of stasis and mobility which characterizes intrahistoria conflicts with the unqualified dynamism of Bergson's cosmic flux. The underlying dualistic structure of intrahistoric reality, according to which essence and appearance, quality and quantity, and eternity and time stand in opposition to one another, is ultimately irreconcilable with the principle of monism which forms the basis of Bergson's theory of cosmic duration. The history of humanity is accommodated in both schemes but to a more orthodox degree in Unamuno's philosophy. This derives from that thinker's admission of a dimension of teleological human consciousness in the structure of intrahistoric reality for which Bergson does not provide in his 'transcendental' theory of duree. In addition, Berg- son's unconventional idea of the role of God paves the way for a broadening of the gulf between his and Unamuno's scheme. The open-ended structure and resulting immanence of duree are equalled and surpassed by the orthodox transcendence and the plenitude which may be realized in the world of intrahistoria. Neither scheme has withstood the ultimate test of critical acceptability as a coherent explanation of the world. Bergson's theory has enjoyed wider acclaim than 794</page><page sequence="9">R. W. FIDDIAN 795 Unamuno's. It is consistent, both with itself and with the modern conception of life and time. The willing and unrestricted dynamism of duree may be loosely compared to the structures of Sir Karl Popper's 'open society'. On a negative note, however, the non-rational foundation of the world elan elevates the theory to the status of a grand mystique in which confidence would be placed only through the reluctant sacrifice of logic. Similarly, Unamuno's apparent success in finding a solution to the problems of purpose, consciousness and God in the historical world may, perhaps, be interpreted as much as the forced appeasement of agonia which intrudes relent- lessly in the contemplative mind, as it may be considered the triumphant answer to certain perplexing questions. His essentialist-cum-activist creed may ultimately be considered an ambitious attempt to make sense of human history which ended in contradiction and frustration, since either half of the system is incomplete without the other. In spite of the ethical implications of Utopian idealism in the theory of intrahistoria, the fundamental notion of immutable essences now seems at best a fiction and at worst a useless anachronism.' Both theories, therefore, appear to be sharing a common fate in an age which demands more than the metaphysical speculation offered by Bergson and Unamuno.. FIDDIAN R. W.
