How do we read the shape of significance in things imbued with human interest? We can regard the embodiment of something, its objectness, sepa- rately from its physical existence and irrespective of its pres- ence. Fixity is never far from human imaginings, from within the immaterial world we inhabit as the real, but modernity brings into question the solidity and permanence of objects in its own characteristic ways. In modernity's historical trsyec- tory, science investigates atomic structure, and the space between atomic particles debunks the solidity of objects; artists embrace optical theories to produce representational paintings; and gentlemen chemists and others figure out how to fix a shadow, eventually even moving ones, allowing the visualization of units of space/ time divorced from human sensory capacity, and further confronting viewers with the dilemmas of fidelity and the problematic boundary between metaphor and metonymy. Canals, then railroads and planes, free travelers from topography, while messages are sent through wires and then without wires, and other wires carry energy that allows human life to resist diurnal cycles. Attacks from the air, by balloon and then by plane, make death into a visualized abstraction. An artist of the revolution paints a black square over a whited-over landscape, announcing a new reality under construction, a preoccupation shared with members of the Western avant-garde - and all share a fasci- nation with the aerial view. Texts, seeming more and more to be fixed, become unfixed, and the materiality of the text itself could be held to reside in the context of human reception, conferring on it a fluidity of signification despite its concrete realizations. Surrealists doubled the presentation of everyday objects as simultaneously concrete and as significations, sweeping them into the realm of the uncanny; the schizophrenia of critical detachment in the reception of art experiences has been laid at the door of Marcel Duchamp, while perpetually living in the future has been the ordinary condition of everyday life for a century or more in the industrializing economies. The conditions of daily life have been cradled or buffeted by the pace of technological change, pulling the rug of the present out from under us. Heraclitus's aphorism "everything flows, nothing stands still" challenges the fixity of Platonic forms. (Plato's solution was to posit a distinction between the worlds of the sensible and of the real.) The great economic and cultural transformations of the 1960s took place in the context of globalization and antico- lonialisme A new worldwide mass image culture and a huge jump in the capitalization of artworks helped spur the radical redefinition of the work of art. From Fluxus and performance to multiples and Conceptualism, artists took aim at received ideas about visuality, objecthood, ownership, and the very telos of art. Forget authorship! How necessary is it even to realize a work - might a set of instructions suffice? What if the work became the environment in which you (might) stand - as "installation," say? Michael Fried, setting "presence" against "presentness," provided a handy way to frame the artistic chasm between artists' revolt and the expectations of high modernism. Re- acting to Minimalism (or, as he dubbed it, literalism), Fried rejected the "theatricality" and temporal performativity - "duration" - of the work sharing the same physical space as the viewer, championing instead the critical distance he saw epitomized by "instantaneity." Fried's antiliteralism hangs onto the immateriality of the work of art (or to a conception of materiality as that which is in motion toward . . .), a "thing" harboring an essence. In this rigid view, the problem with Conceptualism, another great concurrent movement, lies in its ever-present suggestion that it could as well reside in the collective memory of people as in concrete materiality or in that transcendent space, which - now that God was dead - could remain only immanent. As tempted as I might be by the thought of a wholly immaterial /nonphysical artwork, in my own work I find the world of objects and their apparent impenetrability, their immobility, interesting enough. As a young painter I had tried to answer the question how one locates a visual idiom that goes beyond a formal exercise and becomes a mode of representation. Despite the repressive and isolating doctrines of high modernism, the concerns of "citizenship" (for want of a better word) reasserted themselves; suddenly the "art world" became visible in relation to other social institutions and "systems," which helped enlarge the arena of action. Materiality and objecthood, questions of sedimented labor and the commodities circulating in the art world became matters of intense interest to artists like me. Countercul turai values and social activism pierced Cold War quiescence and acquiescence, giving rise to new social movements. I saw artists seeking greater autonomy from art world gatekeepers, those controlling monetary value and cultural value alike. Women artists were engaging in hermeneutical readings of modernist objects, contesting their reception as wholly gen- derless, while insisting on the deformalization of artistic pro- duction; this was the place for me. I found it useful to reverse Fried's valuations, embracing what he condemned as theatricality; but rather than literal- ism, I moved toward Conceptualism 's deemphasis of object- hood. I considered the familiar passages in Karl Marx on commodity fetishism and its origins in the mode of produc- tion; commodity fetishism, Marx posits, shapes our responses to much of the object world. Here was a more powerful route of inquiry, by my lights, than transcendence or sheer, dumb materiality. It is this fetishism and the vexed status of the work of art to</page><page sequence="3">12 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 which I keep returning. My work puts forward a decoy, some- thing that takes a familiar shape but that attracts people toward something else - an object or event, perhaps - that opens a door to a rather different set of concerns. The decoy challenges a naive concreteness, a common-sense positivist- empiricist view of things. Its thingness may be apparent, depthless while still impenetrable, yet it becomes, in effect, transparent in its wooden insistence on being there in front of you, with you. Looking for meaning, you are forced to look through it. Change the conversation! A "Garage Sale," a messy salesroom of discarded ordinary items . . . why is this array of unworthy objects in the art gallery? Propositions may lurk among the objects of desire and disgust - but where exactly is the work of art? That video of a woman reading the manual for an electric wok; is there something worth consid- ering in an appliance manual? Here is a room full of books, with tables and comfortable seating: a traveling library. The books can be read and pages photocopied; where is the artwork here? If it is the library, is it looking at the artist or at the viewer, or does it make visible a universe of discourse out of which art is made, thought, performed? Photographs of skid-row storefronts are paired with lists of words, while the ostensible subject, the drunks, are nowhere to be seen; portraiture by other means, perhaps, but of whom - "us" or "them"? A partly erased TV newscast is overlaid with snippets of the newsman's words, making that flow suddenly visible, if not material. Images from a theater of war coincide, in the same frames, as anodyne ads for happy homes; we know about them both, but not in the same thought. Or take these flat-footed photographs of airports, ordinary roads, streets: we have been there, but what are they doing here? The decoy, the "as-if'-ness, depends on a materiality that like any text is realized only in the contexts of its reception, which means that while materiality powerfully sets up a work, the thing itself, whatever it is, is not fixed, static, as a gener- ation of audience studies has set out to prove. As Allan Kaprow observed, "Today," thanks to Duchamp, "critical dis- course is inseparable from whatever other stuff art is made of." My work, standing amid the world of cultural objects, also wishes to make propositions and hypotheses for the receiver to make her own. Martha Rosier is an American artist working in diverse media , including photography , video, and installation. Her concerns range from landscapes of everyday life to the public sphere , especially as these affect women. In November 2012 New York 's Museum of Modern Art presented her performance event Meta-Monumental Garage Sale [ roslerstudio@earthlink. net , http: //www. martharosler. net/ ]. Caroline Walker Bynum We have long been told that theology in the European Mid- dle Ages attributed to religious images a threefold function of teaching doctrine, preserving memory, and triggering a turn toward the divine. Or, as the titles of two important recent volumes put it, they induced "looking beyond" or "spiritual seeing." Yet we are coming to realize that medieval devotional objects - panel paintings, three-dimensional sculptures, winged altarpieces, relics in their reliquaries, books of hours, altar furnishings, and so forth - should be understood as the immediate presence of the holy more than as indexes, icons, or symbols pointing to something else. They are not merely Lorraine Daston's "things that talk" but vibrantly active stuff, a locus of divine agency.1 Although sacraments, relics, and images make the holy present in different ways, they were far less distinct to the medieval devout than modern studies suggest. And in the later Middle Ages, they all demanded of the viewer/ recipient responses that were tactile, sometimes even gustatory, as well as visual. Pietàs and manuscript pages as well as relics and reliquaries were grasped, stroked, even kissed and tasted. We hear of devout persons who bit into relics or who, while praying, felt the stone of a statue become living flesh under their hands. I focus here on the subset of religious objects modern scholars usually characterize as "images" or "art," although it is important to realize that the word imago in medieval dis- cussions more often refers to a textual image, such as an analogy or concept. I want to argue that medieval images call attention to, indeed, thematize, materiality in ways art histo- rians have not fully understood. First, medieval images refer to their specific stuffness as what it is. The point of the leather that is pasted onto the robe of a wooden Madonna or the oval crystals inserted into the stomachs of Mary and Elizabeth in a Visitation group is not illusion or naturalism. The added materials call attention to themselves as such. The crystal is a crystal as well as a womb; its material announces it to be a valuable container parallel to a reliquary. In a Renaissance painting where the damask backdrop of a Madonna is painted to convincingly mimic cloth, the illusion calls attention to the painterly skill that produced it; exactly by tricking our eyes, it announces that it is not what it appears to be. When a medieval Madonna is literally clothed in brocade, the viewer admires not the skill of the execution but the actual stuff, which remains, to our eyes, stuff. Second, medieval images thematize their materiality not merely by making crystals, brocade, and so forth apparent as such but also by referring explicitly to themselves as material. In an example I discussed in my recent book, Christian Ma- teriality , the artist depicts on a manuscript page (that is, on parchment) Christ's body as a charter offering salvation. The image presents Christ as skin (body) becoming skin (docu- ment) that is on skin (parchment). Or to take another ex- ample, images of the side wound of Christ announce in rubrics written inside the wound that it is a length that can be</page><page sequence="4">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: MATERIALITY 13 multiplied to obtain the real measure of Christ's wound or of his height; such images were also reproduced on girdles tied around women to ease the pain of childbirth. Thus, the image of an opening speaks explicitly (by means of a text written on it) of itself as a physical measure; it also speaks metonymically of another opening (vagina or womb) parallel to Christ's, because, as a mother gives birth to a baby, so Christ gives birth to the world. The image refers to itself both as what it represents (an opening) and as what it is (a mark of a certain length on the page). Third, the stuff these images thematize is paradoxical. By its nature, it sublimates what it depicts. For example, winged altarpieces (which emerged in the European north about 1400) tend to be flat and sometimes even painted in grisaille on the outside; when opened (in the feast-day position), the side panels, although more highly colored, are also usually flat; the inner shrine tends, however, to be sculpted in high relief or in the round. Therefore, the closer the viewer comes to the central encounter with the holy, the more tactile and three-dimensional the scene. Space is left for viewers in their imaginations to move into the central shrine among the figures. Yet the inner scene is usually not so much painted as gilded. More tactile, it is also more heavenly, sparkling in gold. In this way, the inner shrine both emphasizes and sublimates its stuffness. Paradoxically, then, it displays earthly, mutable, malleable stuff as lifted into heavenly changelessness. Art historians have spent much time puzzling over the reaction of medieval Christians to the Second Command- ment: "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing ... in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or ... in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not adore them nor serve them" (Exodus 20:4-5). 2 How could such vibrant, three-dimensional religious art emerge in a tradition so suspicious of graven images? The very materiality of medieval objects is, oddly enough, a partial answer. For medieval believers understood another book of the Hebrew Scriptures, Genesis, to assert that the entire universe is God's creation and manifestation, or as Bonaventura said, God's footprints. Hence, the thirteenth-century nun Mechtild of Hackeborn could see, in a vision, that all earth's flora and fauna down to the smallest fleck of dust are caught up in the humanity of Christ, and the mystic Nicholas of Cusa could argue that Christ not only leads all creation back to God but also gives God to the world in creation. What medieval paint- ers, sculptors, visionaries, and pilgrims encountered in churches was not so much images or "likenesses" as God in his handiwork. When statues and altarpieces, like relics and sacraments, called attention to themselves as material stuff, they asserted themselves to be creation, the expression of the divine.

Natasha Eaton Holi - the coming of the Hindu New Year (Fig. 1) - is asso- ciated not only with the love between Radha and Krishna but also with the bravery of Holika, who, to save her devout nephew Prahlad from his evil father, sacrificed herself by immolation. Holi, as either Krishna's water play - the spray- ing of colored liquid at revelers - or as an instance of the royal carnivalesque, may have been a subject much cele- brated by Indian artists, but it was avidly avoided, perhaps even feared, by European painters. The chucking, rubbing, or mixing pigments that take place at the beginning of the Hindu spring month of Phalguna during Holi, with their tactility, enact their own kind of painting, while to throw dry and wet colors at the paper is to perform painting as a kind of Holi - that is, to partake joyously in sanctified games of playing with color. Although once ground from flowers (also used for medicinal purposes), today many of Holi's pigments are toxic. Color as sacred waste is noxious, even contagious.1 Vertiginous and disorienting, color wreaks havoc with the conventions of its gendered coding and its engendering of what Edward Said has famously termed the colonial power politics of Western attempts to dominate the "East" - "Orien- talism." Maybe we can view the chromatic materiality of the artist's palette as one force field for approaching anew the visual cultures of colonialism. European artists and collectors imi- tated to appropriate the enchanted, color-filled technologies of Indian miniatures, which they deemed desirable rarities but which also carried the threat of becoming waste. The Haps- burg empress Maria Theresa ordered her court artists to cut, paste, and, in places, supplement the colors and composi- tions of precious Indo-Islamic images for their display in the Millionenzimmer of her palace in Schönbrunn, Vienna. With exposure to direct sunlight, their colors soon atrophied, giving them the appearance of sepia drawings - an art form viewed by her court as even more singular than painstakingly colored miniatures. This is just one of many instances where the mechanism of chromatic waste became an object of im- perial desire: waste operates as the defining principle in affluent societies driven by the anxiety of scarcity.2 Waste is not only nonproductive expenditure, it also inhabits a theory</page><page sequence="5">14 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 1 A Holi Festival, Lucknow, Avadh (Oudh), India, 19th century, opaque watercolor and gold on paper, 11% X 7lA&gt; in.

Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., Gift of Charles Lang Freer, Fl 907.255 (artwork in the public domain) of imperial rubbish dependent on ambivalence and the pol- itics of affect.3 To espy neglected, affective materials like pigments in South Asia is to account for the context-making effects of color. These effects smash divisions between objects and subjects, humans and things. After one of his opium-fueled hallucinations, nineteenth-century English writer Thomas De Quincey describes how he morphed (or anthropomorphized anew) into gold and an ancient Egyptian mummy, both of which constituted the mysterious substances of the colonial paint box.4 For architect and arts administrator Owen "Al- hambra" Jones, Oriental color promised respite from and inspiration for industrial design, as well as promising a rem- edy against the proliferation of dreary or garish synthetic dyes. But Jones's rigorous, isolated swatches of Eastern fab- rics, reproduced as sumptuous, aniline plates in his tour de force publication, The Grammar of Ornament (1856), also ex- pose the Victorian phobia of the groundbreaking potential- ities of unregulated color. Maybe even today we in the West "are nonsensuous creatures who are frightened of passions and the body. . . . The combustible mix of attraction and repulsion towards color brings out its magical qualities."5 Here Michael Taussig conjures up modernity's shamanism as a threatening, enchanting mimesis, which he associates with color's etymology as crime or deceit, as in Plato's pharmakeus as the grinder and mixer of multicolored drugs. To be chromophobic is nonetheless to be chromophiliac, precisely because of our (un) certain obsession with color. Taking his inspiration from Roland Barthes's subtle musings on color as a kind of bliss, as a tiny fainting spell, David Batchelor claims that color causes us to fall into a state of grace.6 But there would also seem to be a more forceful and affective politics at stake, since color, as figure (that is, what Jean-François Lyotard refers to as that space beyond speech where intensities are felt) , induces a sentient blindness: aporia as becoming is then the space of color.7 British colonial officials deemed the "obdurate" figure of the Indian dyer to be marginal, poverty-stricken, or else entirely absent from those communities under the purview of the later nineteenth-century ethnographic state.8 Their nu- merous surveys of dyeing across the Indian subcontinent conclude that colored cloth was infrequently worn and only then by liminal groups - Muslims, prostitutes, or tribais. Color is in, of the margins at that point where it might either lose its vitalism or gain an indeterminable currency. Perhaps it was this that made its nuanced recognition by colonial officials almost impossible. In the eugenically inflected thought of the ethnographic state, Indian use, abuse, or shunning of color registered a "primitivist" or degenerate inability to detect chromatic thresholds - a position that can be seen at its most polemical edge in the ambiguous case of elusive blue. The redemptive/violent dimensions of color are best at- tested to during states of exception and moments of crisis. Blue - actual, virtual, and spectral - perhaps had the potency to destroy the critical, material realities of empire. Bengali indigo laborers physically fought and symbolically performed a massive rebellion against the British in 1860 in order to cast blue in terms of the specific identificatory criteria of both the evil eye ( nazar ) and the mirror ( nil darpan).9 Revolutionary and sometimes revolting, the ingredients of the colonial pal- ette - human/cow urine, wine, opium, beetles, arsenic, in- digo, bulls' blood, and stinking human remains (mummy brown) - challenged those Indian artists who fought to reg- ister, recuperate, or remake its quasi-alchemical and ambiv- alent "sauvage/savage" of paint's materiality.10 In the first three decades of the twentieth century, nationalist artist- writers Abanindranath and Rabindranath Tagore and Nan- dalal Bose injected color into the heart of their reactionary pedagogy, practice, and aesthetics by variously favoring Jap- anese wash, Buddhist mural techniques, or German inks. Then the Bengali painter Jamini Roy, possibly inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's advocacy of the curative powers of ingest- ing village soil, which was intended to anticipate the corporal, sub- grassroots level of an independent Indian political con- stitution, ground pigments from the rich red earth of Bankura, his home.

Michael Ann Holly The most recent National Geographic (June 2012) arrived yes- terday as I began to write this "note from the field" and now lies on my desk open to a fascinating cover story on solar storms and the dangers they pose for this planet's technol- ogy. Replete with stunning ultraviolet photographs of the "seething turmoil" in the sun's atmosphere, the report speaks of "planet-size prominences [that] rise into black space like glowing jellyfish, only to loop and slither back hours or days later, as if enthralled by some unseen force" (Fig. I).1 The history of art may possess neither the power nor the threat of a "titanic thermonuclear furnace," but clearly something is seething in this not-so-quiet corner of the humanities. Mate- riality, a concept long relegated to the dark fringes of the art historical universe, is bouncing back from a variety of direc- tions. Might this renewed attention be, in part, an antidote, a reaction to digitalization? Before I wrote a word, I had been envisioning my assigned topic of materiality as a rising sun with various rays both bombarding and shooting out from it (Fig. 2). Armed with the cosmic enticements of the recent photo-essay, I have been emboldened to carry on, if only metaphorically. To be sure, this illustrated attempt to stock my intuition with names, concepts, and categories that "loop and slither back" with each passing work of "hot" new schol- arship could never be coolly accommodated in a mere note. A working definition is in order. I regard materiality as the meeting of matter and imagination , the place where opposites take refuge from their perpetual strife. This characterization, of course, lies in the background of many other slippery distinctions: surface/ depth, vision/ touch, subject/ object, ab- sence/presence, visibility/invisibility, meaningfulness/mean- inglessness, image/medium. Several "weighty" synonyms are perhaps unavoidable: corporeality, physicalness, substance, voluminosity, texture, tangibility, thingness, touchability. A primary issue, it seems to me, is that the history of art has frequently sacrificed an attention to the material presence of works, and, by that, I certainly do not mean an attention to the materials of which they are composed. The obdurate physicality of things has often been repressed in the disci- pline because of its eagerness to energize some kind of meaning production, whether configured as social contexts, stylistic developments, iconographie precedents, artistic ge- nealogies, traces of gendered identities, psychoanalytic symp- toms, and so on. At the other extreme, aesthetics long ago seduced the attention of philosophers of art away from ob- jects so that they might dwell not so much with the stuff of the world as in an abstract, rarefied realm (Hans Belting).2 Con- sequently, it is quite refreshing to consider this rejuvenated fascination with the objectness of the object, maybe even the thing in its thingliness (to paraphrase Martin Heidegger).3 Yes, it comes down to a matter of phenomenology and</page><page sequence="7">ļg ART BULLETIN MARCH 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 1 NASA/SDO/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio, wispy "plasma dancer" on the limb of the Sun, 2012 (photograph in the public domain) embodied perception, emblematized by Maurice Merleau- Ponty's ode to the "flesh" of the world: "things and my body are made of the same stuff. . . . The eye lives in this texture as a man in his house."4 Why not take "physicality as seriously as possible" (James Elkins)?5 Works of art are wrapped round by their own materiality, to which embodied spectators respond. The exchange need not be about locating meaning. Materi- ality (even virtual?) is something that gets in the way of certain kinds of thinking, sometimes even looking - if look- ing involves seeing through to something that lies before or behind or beyond. Materiality is that which halts transpar- ency. At one time or another, anthropologists seemed to come to art historians' aid, at first through studies of material culture (culture comes from stuff; things make people) and eventu- ally through concepts of agency (Alfred Gell).6 If not pre- cisely animate, objects are viewed as enlivened by their ma- terial passage through the lives and loves of people. And then there is an allied claim. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, distinctions among humans, animals, and other forms of life, from microbes to marigolds, no longer seem as clear-cut as they once did in the aftermath of the Enlighten- ment. "Quasi-subjects" and "quasi-objects" (Bruno Latour)7 are made of the same stuff, the stuff of this planet (maybe even its stars), so as inquisitive humans we do not so much work on this world as within it (shades of Heidegger) . "After all, the world is around me, not in front of me" (Merleau- Ponty).8 As embodied spectators we can - and often do- animate material works of art as though they are living things, capable of communicating novel ideas and principled com- mitments back to us. Thing theory has lent a suggestive "as if' quality not only to significant physical objects but also, and especially, to powerful works of art. Materiality is more than a medium. A medium is that which carries a visual message, and together - structure and im- age - they result in the thickness, the sensuous materiality of a work of art, a thing among other things. Yet in its physical vibrancy, its affect and effect, this special thing possesses a certain kind of agency. "Art historians may 'know' that the pictures they study are only material objects . . . but they fre- quently talk and act as if pictures had feeling, will, conscious- ness, agency, and desire" (W. J. T. Mitchell) .9 And, finally, a note on this note. What if works of art are 2 Michael Ann Holly and Julie Walsh, Materiality , 2012 (photograph provided by the author) not material objects at all but instead are seen through their representations? Not only digital and video arts but also many performance arts, some conceptual arts, and so on, would seem to possess a medium without corporeality. As Bill Brown has recently maintained, "no matter how variously the term may be deployed, materiality has come to matter with new urgency" because of the "threat" that digital media pose in a wide range of disciplines from film to the history of science.10 I would argue, nevertheless, that because these digital images manifest themselves as presences, that is, even though many of them are regarded as disembodied, they exist in the form of "as if' presences with different ontologies made real in the material world. They enrich our perceptions, fill our con- sciousnesses, add to our experiences "as if' something sub- stantive has transpired. New media extend and expand our optical capacities, exceed our visionary capacities. They have a "texture" and character all their own. The National Geo- graphic writer unwittingly offers us a synonymous phrase for this immaterial, material universe when he characterizes the solar magnetic fields as composed of plasma, what he calls the "fourth state of matter,"11 neither liquid, solid, nor gas. As Belting would assert, the fact that the image is neither here nor there does not mean it is immaterial. It is an event in the world, a substance that occasionally is substanceless, evinces tangibility sometimes without physical touch, and even might cunningly illustrate materiality without being material.

Amelia Jones On an obvious level, art history is constrained to address materiality as a primary concern. After all, the discipline de- veloped in response to the rise of capitalism and industrial- ism and the concurrent invention of the notion of the work of "art" as a painting or object that could be commissioned, bought, sold, and/or experienced in a physical way, in spaces materially formatted to accommodate the work. Art in this framework, substantiated by the influential philosophers of aesthetics in the eighteenth century such as Immanuel Kant, was defined as a special kind of object (image, building, sculpture) produced through human agency and tending to call forth an aesthetic response by means of its particular material , thematic, and formal qualities. As has long been acknowledged, however, Kant's aesthetics in particular identified a fundamental contradiction precisely in relation to art's materiality. For art is material (otherwise we could not experience it through our subjective senses) and yet immaterial: for Kant, it must confirm universal, tran- scendent values, or it cannot move beyond the status of the everyday or the natural.1 Kant articulates this contradic- tion with great finesse in the 1790 Critique of Judgment , where he invents the complex concept of "subjective uni- versality," which, however, does not resolve the problem. Through the notion that the art interpreter must claim "disinterest" while making an interested (subjective) judg- ment (that is, must not "need," "want," or "use" the object to meet an end) , Kant keeps in play the tension between our need in art history and aesthetics for art to be static and material and for it to be immaterial in its value and potential meanings.2 This contradiction, however, was disavowed in dominant discourses of modernism in the visual arts in the twentieth century, and the productive quality of the tension spuriously resolved in favor of the immaterial through subjective asser- tions of truth value. Throughout the last century, Kantian theory was increasingly attenuated such that claims of abso- lute value could be made by theorists, including, most fa- mously in the United States, art critic Clement Greenberg and his followers such as art historian Michael Fried. For influential modernist formalists such as Greenberg and Fried, value, though subjectively proclaimed, was stated as a fact, the hidden presumption being that the value and mean- ing emanated from the material object (that is, the tradi- tional art historical canards that the interpreter should let the object "speak for itself' or should simply absorb the artwork's "presentness as grace").3 The trick, of course, was that the value and meaning were in fact being "revealed" in their truth by the critic, whose "interest" in the interpretation was disingenuously glossed over or denied. In his method, Greenberg epitomized this sleight of hand by which the materiality of the artwork was both glancingly acknowledged (Greenberg had to have en- gaged with the things themselves) and simultaneously dis- avowed through value-laden interpretations relying on ab- stract concepts of form. Greenberg could not, for example, foreground his "material" possession of some of Jackson Pol- lock's paintings without delegitimizing his claims for their supposedly inherent value.4 Art's materiality is, depending on the context, both ac- cepted in art history and perennially disavowed.5 It is fore- grounded when interpreters profess to be letting the forms and materials of the work "speak." It is disavowed by critics and art historians when assertions of value come into play. Curators and gallerists and auctioneers, of course, must grap- ple more directly with this contradiction as they traffic in things .6 The great paradox of art value systems, as developed in the discipline of art history and related fields such as art criticism and curating, then, resides in precisely this tension between the transcendently secured value of the work of art and its obdurate materiality. Even in the case of performance art - a genre now finally being admitted into art history and the hallowed halls of modernist art institutions such as the Mu- seum of Modern Art, New York - the materiality of the body tends to be both reified and ignored. In this light, performance art becomes the limit case for art history. With the recent resurgence of interest in perfor- mance art we have tended, still, to make the fluid, durational vicissitudes of live art into fixed objects - per the Museum of Modern Art's recent display in vitrines of the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Collection of Fluxus "works"; or, even more strik- ingly, its mounting of reenactments and documents securing the privileged history of Marina Abramovič's past perfor- mances in the retrospective of her work in 2011, The Artist Is Present? This exhibition was crowned by the installation of the artist's live body in the klieg-lighted, camera-surveilled atrium of the museum, proclaimed via the title of the show as "present." Abramovič's body was "material," to be sure. One</page><page sequence="9">ļg ART BULLETIN MARCH 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 could experience the "thereness" of the body, witness its living functions (breathing, eyes blinking, swallowing on oc- casion). At the same time, its placement in the museum atrium as an object of visitors' gazes (she sat, immobile, before a stream of individual spectators sitting across from her) reified it as spectacle. The experience of Abramovič's "presence" epitomized the dangers of concretizing all processes and creative flows into singular, viewable "moments" or "works," of maintaining presen tness as the grace of the art experience, without ac- counting for the vicissitudes of the subjective senses, according to Kant a crucial aspect of the aesthetic experience. For the presence of Abramovič functioned at the expense of the participation of the visitor. The visitor was forced simply to confirm the disavowal of the materiality of this "transcen- dent" art experience. Attempting to have our materiality or "presentness" while claiming transcendence or "grace" at the same time keeps us tied to modernist structures of belief and, paradoxically, subordinated to late capitalist, fluid materialities against our will, participating in marketplaces and exchanges in ways that compromise our assertions of value. By acknowledging the historic contradiction built into models of interpretation in aesthetics, we can move beyond the hypocrisy of determining inherent value for things we call art and perhaps engage with them in ways that change us by putting ourselves in motion. This might be a new way of "letting them speak" - not for themselves but in dialogue with particular interpreting sub- jects. Amelia Jones is Professor and Grierson Chair in Visual Culture. Her recent publications include articles on performance art histories , feminist art, and curating. She recently published Seeing Differ- ently: A History and Theory of Identification and the Visual Arts and Perform Repeat Record: Live Art in History, co-edited with Adrian Heathfield [Art History and Communication Studies Department, McGill University , Montreal , Quebec H3A 0G5, Can., amelia.jones@mcgill. ca ]. Notes 1. Art in this model functions as a specific case of "thing," possessing mate- riality; because we call it art, the artwork calls forth a particularly charged response from a viewer, who will inevitably relate to it as the expression of a subject who presumably made it. I address this constella- tion of forces defining "art" in the Euro-American context at length in Amelia Jones, Seeing Differently: A History and Theory of Identification and the Visual Arts (London: Routledge, 2012). In this discussion here, one could open the door to "thing theory" or "actor-network-theory," the latter as articulated by sociologist Bruno Latour; see his Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005). In relation to art in particular, see also the anthropologist Alfred Gell's Art and Agency: An Anthropological Theory (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998). 2.

This is the case even with supposedly purely conceptual works of art. There are legendary cases of artworks that supposedly did not exist ex- cept as concepts by artists and curators from Marcel Duchamp to Robert Rauschenberg, Yves Klein, and Seth Siegelaub to, most recently, Tino Sehgal and legions of performative artists challenging our tendency to turn the live act into something material However, the fact that we have some knowledge of these works indicates that materiality - usually an object (readymade) or text and/or photographs or digital files or video clips (in Rauschenberg's, Klein's, Siegelaub's, and Sehgal's cases) - ex- ists somewhere. 7.

Michael Kelly The turn to materiality in contemporary art and theory in- vokes the profane (for example, sensation, affect, empathy, desire, neuron, evidence, thing - or power), regardless of whether the materiality at issue concerns the artist, partici- pant, or work of art. Yet this turn is accompanied by a countervailing turn to the sacred in art (for example, pres- ence, alterity, vitalism, the sublime, the transcendent, the immaterial, the spiritual - or power), which is imagined to be beyond materiality and even art. The connection as well as contrast between these turns should not be surprising if we remember that materiality implies not only the tangible phys- ical world but also its structure, which is immaterial and sometimes associated with the sacred or sublime (such as chaos or complexity) . We can see echoes of these divergent but connected turns in several developments in contempo- rary art. For example, conceptualism in art since the 1960s (not just Conceptual art) entails both the ¿^materialization of the art object and the materialization of art experience (as in installation, performance, and participatory art). And as tech- nology from photography through digital media increasingly shapes the production, reception, and archiving of art, art assumes an immaterial appearance (that is, virtual, cyber) , yet theorists recognize that digital media depend as much as traditional art media on material support (Fig. 1). Are the turns to the sacred and to materiality as rivalrous as the classic form/ matter distinction from which they likely originate? Does the tension between them represent the contemporary defiance or confirmation of Marx's critical</page><page sequence="10">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: MATERIALITY ļg 1 Francis Alys, in collaboration with Cuauhtémoc Medina and Rafael Ortega, video still from When Faith Moves Mountains , 2002 (Lima, Peru) , vidfco (36 minutes) and photographic documentation of an action (artwork © Francis Alýs; photograph provided by David Zwirner, New York) insight about modernity in the Communist Manifesto that "All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned"? Or are these turns reflective of various attempts to counter or extend the limits or successes of contemporary art theory? Alternatively, are these turns (also) complementary, if con- flicting strategies for critiquing the (overly) subjective con- ception of modern art, namely, that the artist's agency (un- derstood as autonomous creativity, representational powers, expressive needs, and the like), whether affirmed or resisted, has generated the logic (s) and meaning (s) of modern art? If so, there is a shared motivation between these turns to re- conceive artistic agency without a primary focus on the agency of the artist. One way to recognize what is driving this Janus-faced cri- tique in art is to look at how technology and art are related to materiality. Technology is, in part, a set of practices and artifacts emerging from subjectivity's attempts to endure, understand, and control materiality. Over time, these prac- tices and artifacts appear to acquire independence from the very materiality that engenders them, to the point that tech- nology seemingly renders subjectivity autonomous and itself immaterial. Similarly, art is, in part, a set of practices and artifacts enabling subjectivity to differentiate itself from ma- teriality, culminating in art's as well as the subject's apparent autonomy (from society and nature) . When technology pro- gressively shapes the production, reception, and archiving of contemporary art, these two forms of subjectivity are com- pounded, making the break from materiality seem realizable, if not realized. In this light, art's turn to materiality in the digital age is a resistance to the subjectivization of technology and art alike. At the same time, because such subjectivization entails a disregard of the sacred, the turn to the sacred complements the material turn. In short, the turns share an object of critique - the (over) subjectivization of art (and technology) - even though they pursue different strategies of critique (Fig. 2). However, the underlying issue here is not merely technol- ogy, the various iterations of materiality and the sacred, or even subjectivity. What is at stake is artistic agency, for the more art has become subjective and autonomous over the course of modern history, the more it seems to have lost agency (that is, power, aura, purpose, or function). One way to counter this loss - in an effort to ensure that art matters (again) - is to reconceptualize artistic agency, starting with a relative decentering of subjectivity and a measured disavowal of autonomy. Sometimes this reconceptualization involves a conflict be- tween the material and the sacred, as we have seen, but sometimes the conflict is within the concepts of materiality or the sacred. For example, "materiality" can mean the "pure" or "base" materiality that alludes to art's Other as the source of artistic agency, which cannot be attributed merely to the artist but which is also not attributable just to the materiality of the artwork or the historical materiality of society. While this allusion leaves space for the sacred in the material, there is a similar conflict regarding the sacred, because part of its essence is to be materialized in art, it is argued, yet no artistic materialization is adequate to the sacred. In both instances of conceptual conflict, what is invoked is an agency that cannot be reduced to human artifice, whether art or technology, though neither artifice is possible with- out it (Fig. 3). The reconceptualization of artistic agency is complicated. Although modern artists reasonably imagined they would acquire more agency once art became autonomous (as au- tonomy is equated with freedom), they eventually realized that subject-based artistic agency has lost efficacy because autonomy implies distance (whether as withdrawal or exclu- sion) from the world stage on which agency can be enacted. So modern artists gradually, if unwittingly, ceded autonomy by relinquishing subjective agency (considered as authorial control) to the unconscious, desire, affect, sensation, neu-</page><page sequence="11">20 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 2 Lynn Hershman Leeson, image of Roberta Breitmore, Screenshot from Life2, 2007, an ongoing artwork in Second Life (artwork © Lynn Hershman Leeson; image provided by the Kunsthalle Bremen, the Paule Anglim Gallery, Waldburger Gallery, and Bitforms Gallery) 3 Marina Abramovič, The Artist Is Present , 2010, The Museum of Modern Art, New York (artwork © 2012 Marina Abramovič; photograph by Jonathan Muzikar, © 2012 The Museum of Modern Art, New York, provided by Sean Kelly Gallery) rons, and other modes of materiality that sometimes, how- ever, are couched in terms of the sacred (for example, play or chance) because it, too, is beyond the autonomous subject. In effect, because the various iterations of materiality and the sacred embody art's heteronomy, modern artists exchanged autonomy for heteronomy (Fig. 4) . Put in more positive terms, we are now in a position to avow the heteronomy of contemporary art, albeit with a critical eye (granted, once the link between autonomy and critique is reconceptualized) , and to understand artistic agency as a function of the conflicting and converging modes of agency in the artist, participant, work of art, and their shared, if disjunctive, worlds. As such, artistic agency may dethrone the artist as an autonomous agent, but it also secures the avowal of heteronomy as a condition for art's relative autonomy; it may deconstruct the subjectivity of the participants as well, but it occasions and anchors their collective participation in art; and it provides objective credentials beyond subjectivity for the work's historical roles as evidence, witness, or the like. The turn to materiality, especially if interpreted in connec- tion with the turn to the sacred, allows us to recognize the avowal of heteronomy as a way to understand artistic agency in contemporary art. Art is practiced in the heteronomous spaces between the sacred and the material, turning one way, then the other, sometimes simultaneously. For art is the enactment of a composite agency inspirited in the material processes of pro- ducing, experiencing, and conceptualizing works of art. A major task of aesthetic theory today is to make better con- ceptual sense of this composite artistic agency in relation to particular forms of contemporary art and their various aspi- rations, operations, and effects.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: MATERIALITY gl 4 Doris Salcedo, For Hans Haacke and Edward Fry , 2009, framed archival pigment inkjet print on Hahnemûhle Photo Rag, 29 Vè X 39% in.

Robin Kelsey A photograph that Timothy H. O'Sullivan took for a geolog- ical survey in the American West led by Clarence King depicts a miner wielding a pickax against a rocky tunnel wall (Fig. 1 ) . The photograph speaks to the durability of this geologic matter, which gives way to the hammering iron only chip by chip. It thus speaks as well to the hard labor of the miner, whose material existence a ruthless industry has cramped. O'Sullivan has composed the photograph around these un- yielding matters. The arm and the pickax occupy the center, directing our attention to the act of striking the rock, which concentrates the miner's bodily force on a single point in the shallow depression he has hewn. The rocky slab rises between two posts, while two boards extend toward us from below, giving the composition an internal frame and a rough sym- metry. The miner sits on one board, and the wheel of a cart rests on the other. The pairing reminds us of the mechanical motions of the miner, who must trace arcs with his pickax time and again, as his labor grinds on. This description of the photograph suggests that it is all about materiality, and in a sense it is. But then again, this description has treated the photograph as an image, which is to say, as something immaterial. My description would apply to a glass negative in the National Archives, Washington, D.C., an albumen print in the collection of the George Eastman House, Rochester, New York, a duotone reproduc- tion in a magazine, or a digital reproduction on a computer screen. It focuses on issues of iconicity and composition that the image retains from one material instance to the next and ignores the reproductive economy itself. Although art history is thought to celebrate originality and uniqueness, it has always trafficked heavily in reproductions and shaped itself intellectually around the aesthetic qualities that thrive in its reproductive chains. When I treat O 'Sullivan' s photograph as if it were an image all about materiality, I am implicitly insist- ing that the particular materiality of the photograph - in all its instances - does not in fact matter. On this score, O'Sullivan is ahead of me, because his photograph recognizes its materiality as a photograph through analogy and trace. The position of the miner echoes that of the photographer: each is an agent of western enter- prise who brings a light into darkness to work a silver-bearing surface by framing it up, taking aim, and hoping for a lucky strike (O'Sullivan made the picture in a silver mine and used plates coated with a silver emulsion). Even as this analogy wheels us back to the labor of photography, traces in the photograph recall the light and time that this labor requires.</page><page sequence="13">22 ART bulletin march 2013 VOLUME xcv number 1 1 Timothy H. O'Sullivan, At Work - Gould àf Curry Mine , January-February 1868, albumen print, 7 X 7% in. (17.8 X 19.4 cm). George Eastman House, International Museum of Photography and Film, Rochester, N.Y. (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by George Eastman House, International Museum of Photography and Film) The glare on several surfaces and the two threads of light that drop in from the left are remnants of the ignition of magne- sium powder that O'Sullivan used to illuminate the tunnel. Although we associate flash photography with crisp depic- tions of moving bodies, his flash lasted too long to catch the miner in the act of swinging his pickax. The labor we see is staged: we can detect the miner's static pose in the placid muscles and tendons of his arm. In the moment of produc- tion, an expenditure of one precious mineral, magnesium, illuminated a search for another, silver, which was being expended along with time to make the photograph. In this way, O'Sullivan deposited many signs of the material econ- omy of his labor. These signs survive the translation from photograph to image but always remind us of what does not. The photograph of the miner offers us an occasion to rethink the relation of materiality to modernism. There is much caricaturing of modernism these days that cabins its reflexive ambitions within the confines of a rarified concern for medium specificity or vague drivel about purity or pres- ence. But so much great modernist work vitally addressed the material conditions of its production far beyond arty issues of medium, and in so doing plunged headlong into impurity and absence. To me, O'Sullivan is a modernist of the first water not because he anticipated or influenced later photog- raphy (most practitioners who have claimed him as an inspi- ration have not followed his example in any meaningful way) but because his work so trenchantly recognizes its material demands and implications. This kind of modernist reflexivity was always directed against the making of objects into images, a principal function of commodification. Remembering the material dimensions of modernist re- flexivity is particularly important now, when our desire to make the world into images has attained such spectacular and dismal fulfillment. The museum without walls and the commercial arcade have given way to the humming streams of cyberspace, which disseminate digital imagery to seemingly every purse and pocket. Where the flaneur once roamed in search of modern delights, earbudded pedestrians text and tweet. When it comes to visual culture, our fluid screens are hegemonic, and everything else is on the margins: odd, inert, and quaint. Analogue photography, which once, in compar- ison with older pictorial media, seemed de-skilled and dema- terializing, now appears difficult, tactile, and dense. Anything fashioned by an individual without keyboard or mouse has an aura of lost artistry and reminds us, however briefly, of the real. Photographs might as well be paintings. Although this may not be cause for nostalgia, it is certainly grounds for reconsidering what kind of materiality matters most now. The dialectical materialism of Karl Marx insisted that social life is essentially practical. As Slavoj Zižek has perspicaciously suggested, this axiom implies that the place of ideological illusion is not in the knowing but in the doing.1 If, for example, my belief in a crisis of human-induced cli- mate change and other impending ecological devastations does nothing to change my practical habits, my belief is immaterial. Being aware and informed offers no protection in itself against ideology. This reconsideration of materiality brings up the question: Which of the matters that are lost in the making of images are most vital to remember now in the course of taking practical action? In light of the climate</page><page sequence="14">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: MATERIALITY 23 problem, our energy woes, and the plight of the working class, mining may be as good a place to start as any. As we proceed, we might remember the inexorableness with which materiality leads us back to tautology. To write that O 'Sullivan' s photograph speaks grimly of its materiality in ways that we can reconstruct from a reproduction is not to enter into the materiality of his photograph per se but rather to write about it. Today, writing means tapping on plastic keys, staring at a screen, and establishing a pattern of distrac- tion. This in turn requires a material substrate that we rarely think about. A personal computer commonly contains alumi- num, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chro- mium, cobalt, copper, gallium, gold, iron, lead manganese, mercury, palladium, platinum, selenium, zinc, and even sil- ver, in a trace amount. The fluorescent bulbs in most offices contain rare earth phosphors, tungsten, and mercury vapor. The massive servers that handle Internet searches run on electricity, the leading global source of which is coal. Mate- riality never arrives in an argument any more than it arrives in an image. But if we are ever to act on what we know, then we ought to know what we do, which means seeing our materiality in the work of another. As I labor through my paragraphs, this is what I am aiming at: somewhere else, someone is mining.

Alisa LaGamma Over the last century, "African art" in Western consciousness has become synonymous with wood sculpture. This reflects the fact that wood sculpture is the dominant form of material culture from the region represented in museum collections. Yet sub-Saharan Africa's legacy of material culture is actually distinguished by the sheer variety of media harnessed by its artists. This diversity of materials sometimes reflects prag- matic choices based on what has been most readily available. More often, a work's medium has been selected for concep- tual associations calculated to enrich its content. In African art, form and material are inextricably linked in the defini- tion of a work's aesthetic and intended meaning. Local resources such as gold, copper, and ivory, identified with life force and physical might, were drawn on to create artifacts of great prestige, which were exported globally through trans-Saharan and coastal trade (Fig. 1). While the gold regalia of Akan notables in Ghana were recast every generation, north of the Limpopo River at the thirteenth- century site of Mapungubwe, elites were buried with distinc- tive gold artifacts conceived to define them for eternity. Of equal importance has been the inspired translation of ordi- nary matter, such as mud or clay and stone, into sculptural and architectural landmarks. At Djenne, in present-day Mali, generations have resurfaced and reshaped the ever evolving form of its Great Mosque, the world's most monumental adobe structure. In contrast, the incalculable labor required to produce the pilgrimage site of Lalibela in northern Ethi- opia is so beyond contemporary imagination that angels are credited with its miraculous apparition. There in the twelfth century an epic excavation of living rock transformed the lithic landscape into a complex of thirteen churches.

Expanding the repertory of matter that defines major forms of expression has been a priority for ritual specialists in West and Central Africa, who have mined the natural world for potent ingredients, such as porcupine quills, bird skulls, antelope horns, termite mounds, and earth. Exactingly cus- tomized blends of such esoteric matter are added to the surface of Komo headdresses or to the interior cavities of power figures carved out of wood by Senufo, Bamana, or Kongo sculptors (Figs. 2, 3). Each of these collaborative creations is essentially defined by its unique composition. Artists have also exploited imported matter for its rarity, exoticism, or novelty. Access to European brass fueled the casting of a diverse repertory of sculptural genres at the court of Benin; glass beads from Asia and eastern Europe inspired the proliferation of forms of personal adornment across the continent; and the aluminum detritus of beverage botding companies in eastern Nigeria has been resuscitated in the contemporary handwoven sculptural panels and installation pieces by El Anatsui. An incisive appreciation of the material creations of Afri- can artists provides a critical point of entry into their world- views, ideals, aspirations, and concerns. This is especially the case for cultures that have undergone profound transforma- tions and for which few other documentary sources survive. The relatively small fraction of Africa's precolonial material culture that is preserved in institutional collections in the West was itself for the most part minimally documented before it was dispersed internationally. The sudden and wholesale uprooting of this heritage by Europeans from the end of the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries has made it challenging to form a coherent vision of the artistic legacy of particular communities. Science is increasingly al- lowing us the means to analyze the physical composition of such precious primary sources in great detail. Tools such as polarized light microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction are affording exhaustive descriptions of individual artifacts. In order to interpret those data, however, it is necessary to relate them to an understanding of the culturally specific qualities ascribed to particular materials. For all its fragmentary nature, Africa's scattered material culture is especially precious in light of the fact that its precolonial creations constitute the only direct points of historical engagement between us and their authors. In soci- eties that relied on oral traditions for the transmission of information, the artistic record remains the only fixed pri- mary source concerning the past. In A History of the World in 100 Objects , Neil MacGregor foregrounds our reliance on the interpretation of material culture as the primary means of obtaining insight into the chapters of human experience without texts.1 This past year I gathered together a diverse corpus of works produced in eight distinct artistic centers across West and Central Africa as the focus of the exhibition Heroic Africans : Legendary Leaders , Iconic Sculptures , which considered the over- arching significance of an array of sculptural traditions con- ceived as material markers for influential men and women.2 As enduring material surrogates for their subjects, those cre- ations embodied the aspirations of individuals to define and extend their legacy beyond their lifetime. The artists charged with their creation afforded their influential subjects a lasting physical presence within their communities. These land- marks filled the void that was the inevitable result of their mortality and provided important points of reference through which they might be invoked. In many instances, it was possible to relate specific works to their original subject</page><page sequence="16">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: MATERIALITY 25 3 Power figure ( Nkisi N'Kondi: Mangaaka) , Kongo peoples, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of Congo, or Cabinda Province, Angola, mid- to late 19th century, wood, paint, metal, resin, ceramic, height 46V£ in.

For the vast may ori ty, however, it was clear that although the impetus for their creation had been an important individual, the works themselves constituted the only surviving trace of the very existence of those figures who can no longer be specifically identified. Often such works were themselves the concrete site of veneration through which their subjects were petitioned on an ongoing basis. Both the forms of representation and the rites and customs developed to activate these material points of engagement took many different forms. Often the surfaces of sculptures that acted as living shrines were altered through the accretion of layer upon layer of applied libations (Fig. 4) . Also striking is the often emphatic density of accumulated material culture assembled as the point of connection with revered ancestors. For example, at the court of Benin in Nigeria, altars dedicated to the memory of particular kings featured an array of carved ivory and brass, artifacts in addi- tion to brass commemorative heads associated with that par- ticular leader (Fig. 5). Outside Akan communities of Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, rites celebrating the passage of distin- guished individuals culminated with the deposition of cere- monial terra-cottas at dedicated groves defined by enormous piles of sculptures accrued over generations (Fig. 6) . Among the most sublime sculptural creations are the figures carved by Hemba masters in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to commemorate exceptional members of a chiefly lineage (Figs. 7, 8) . These monumental wood sculptures gave mate- rial expression to a leader's claim to a particular territory and allowed him to petition his ancestors on behalf of the com- munity in times of crisis.

The choice of the media for such monuments was cultur- ally determined - costly locally harvested ivory and imported metals were favored by the kings of Benin, common clay closely associated with Creation was harnessed by Akan and Yoruba notables, while various locally available hardwoods were the choice of ambitious patrons in other centers across West and Central Africa. Ultimately, their shared imperative was to furnish these elites with a material landmark. In each instance, the representations were conceived as tributes that afforded influential individuals a concrete locus as an exten- sion of their ephemeral bodily being. The form of material expression that most blurs the boundaries between physical bodily presence and evocative representation is that of the many distinctive reliquary traditions sponsored by extended families across equatorial Africa. Those of the Kota from Gabon and the Republic of the Congo and of the Fang from southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon are the best known for the sculptural elements that have survived (Fig. 10). These were the profane accessible dimension of portable shrines within which relics drawn from distin- guished ancestors were preserved in attached hide bundles or bark containers. The sacra assembled within, crania and bones relating to as many as nine different generations of familial ancestors, were identified with exceptional individu- als conceived as especially effective advocates with the divine. Their highly abstract figurative sculptural corollaries were, in contrast, associated with the entire extended family. The physical immediacy of carefully composed reliquary ensem- bles allowed the experiences of past generations of an ex- tended family to remain vivid.

Across Africa, material works of art were crucial to keeping their subjects alive and their example relevant in the memory and imagination of members of their community. They sur- vive from earlier periods as far more than footnotes that provide insights into broader historical narratives. Instead, in the absence of contemporaneous written diaries, journals, or any fixed literary texts and musical scores, they constitute the only direct expressions relating to major societies. At the same time, this material culture represented but one dimen- sion of forms of expression that were originally integrated into dynamic contexts in which song, dance, and ritual per- formances expanded on their significance. Conceived as tan- gible bridges with the past for members of their own com- munities, these enduring physical creations now serve that role for all of humanity. The material record, MacGregor notes, gives back to their creators a voice through which history may be told.3 Alisa LaGamma, curator of African art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , has overseen since 1 998 an ambitious program of exhibitions and publications, recognized for its outstanding scholarship in 2012 by the Bard Graduate Center.

Monika Wagner Dust Literally as well as metaphorically, dust appears as the sediment of time. Dust is found everywhere, at first invisible, but constantly accumulating and sooner or later becoming visible. Dust is the entropie material; it permanendy confronts us with the end of all things and forms. As the decompositum of former objects, materials, or living beings, dust is the paragon of deformation. Though it is persistently and uncompromis- ingly fought in the daily routine, in art dust has acquired the status of vanitas. In the hierarchy of materials, dust ranks as useless resi- due - literally, as having dropped to the lowest level - and is considered to be an extremely poor substance. This is already verified in the patristic literature, with its scaling from dust to gold. From the middle of the nineteenth century, the sci- ences began to study dust systematically, as one can see in the micrographs of Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (Fig. I).1 Such illustrations were popular enough to prompt caricatures, be- cause the microscopic forms of dust, invisible to the human eye, seemed intriguingly unreal. Dusting - a project of modernism: Walter Benjamin character- ized plush, the material epitome of the late nineteenth-cen- tury historicist interior, as "dust traps."2 These traps were dusted and purified by the avant-garde's uncluttered sur- faces. To dust the masterworks of traditional museums, which is like dusting a neo-Baroque interior, was Robert Filliou's concern in the 1970s: the fluffy dusting cloth in a cardboard box, together with a photograph of a famous museum's exhibit being dusted by the artist with a cloth exactly like the one in the box, claim that the fabric physically preserves the dust of the masterwork, like a contact relic (Fig. 2). 3 More-</page><page sequence="20">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: MATERIALITY 29 1 Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, Dust from Scirocco , engraving, from Passat-Staub und Blut-Regen , Berlin, 1849 (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Universitäts- bibliothek Augsburg) 2 Robert Filliou, Poussière de Poussière de l'effet Frans Hals, La Bohémienne , 1977, box with duster and photograph, 2Vè X 6V2 X 45á in.

Andersch Collection, Neuss (artwork © Marianne Filliou; photograph provided by Andersch Collection, Neuss) over, the duster provides the owner of the work with an instrument for literally participating in the dusting project. While Filliou in a witty gesture demonstratively blew off dust, Marcel Duchamp - like many later artists - virtually cele- brated it in an objection to the overall purifications of the early avant-garde. Getting dusty : Duchamp contaminated the modernist clear- ing by allowing the dust to settle as a visible trace of passing time on his uncompleted Large Glass (Fig. 3).4 Already in 1875, John Ruskin had praised "the ethics of the dust" as "golden stains of time." In doing so, Ruskin defended the patina of stone surfaces of centuries-old buildings.5 By con- trast, Duchamp's "dust breeding" took only half a year, with the dust accumulating on the glass panels of the unfinished picture that the artist had left lying on the floor of his New York studio while he traveled in Europe. The avant-garde ideal of gloss, transparency, and immateriality embodied in glass thus turned opaque, dull, and dirty. Man Ray fixed the ephemeral "dust breeding" in a photograph, the irregular texture of the dust appearing on the glossy surface.6 When the photograph was published in 1921, uncropped and with captions, in the Surrealist magazine Littérature, it provided an extraterrestrial view of a planet made of dust. In Duchamp' s Dust Breeding, the dust, to which Georges Bataille devoted an entry in his Dictionnaire critique in 1929, already appeared to be on the path to victory: When plump young girls, "maids of all work," arm them- selves each morning with a large feather-duster or even a vacuum-cleaner, they are perhaps not completely unaware that they are contributing every bit as much as the most positivist of scientists to dispelling the injurious phantoms that cleanliness and logic abhor. One day or another, it is true, dust . . . will probably begin to gain the upper hand over domestics.7 Refiguring dust During further work on his "definitely un- finished" picture, Duchamp fixed parts of the dust with var- nish. The shapeless stuff was thus refigured as brownish cones, only to be crushed again within the narrative of the picture by the chocolate grinder. Forty years later, Joseph</page><page sequence="21">30 ART bulletin march 2013 VOLUME xcv number 1 3 Man Ray, Dust Breeding , 1920, gelatin photograph, 4V£ X 634 in. (11.4 X 17.2 cm).

Museum Ludwig, Cologne (artwork © VG BILD-KUNST, Bonn 2012) Beuys refigured dust and benefited from the rhetoric of the poor material for Staubbild Magda (Fig. 4) .8 A vaguely shaped figure of fluff glued to paper and kept under glass was five years later, in 1965, mounted on a "halved felt cross [Hal- biertes Filzkreuz ;] ," correlating dust with felt - a material made of waste, such as hair.9 The tide Staubbild Magda refers to Mary Magdalene, the penitent who threw herself into the dust before Jesus and who is depicted in traditional iconog- raphy robed only in her own hair. Beuys saved the dust as Christ had saved the sinner. Dust here evolves from an en- tropic material to become part of an everlasting cycle, in which materials are continually transformed. Raising dust and reading dust Since the 1980s, when mem- ory and the archive became mzyor concepts in the humani- ties, many artists have used dust as the debris of destruction and annihilation.10 While some treat dust as a witness to historic incidents or disasters, such as Xu Bing in his Dust Project referring to 9/11, Claudio Parmeggiani shows in his shadow library traces of vanished books that can be tracked in the dust. In the late 1980s the Austrian experimenter Erwin Wurm also raised lots of dust. Though his "dust sculptures" indicate passing time and change, showing the traces of objects withdrawn from showcases, the artist po- sitioned himself beyond the pathos of authenticity, which is easily invoked by the paradigm of the absent. Instead, he plays with the stimulation of the imagination. Wurm avoids elevating the absent as historically prominent and he keeps the origin of the dust traceable. For, like a conceptual artist, Wurm sells certificates for realizing dust sculptures (Fig. 5). With the certificate for "Dustpiece o.T." from 1990, Wurm gives a demystifying instruction on "how to make the dust": take the dust of a vacuum cleaner and put it into a t-shirt.

I have much more time with the subject as I prepare new lectures, attend those of my col- leagues, and finally write up pieces of research. Gone are the tasks of museum management and administration that even- tually drove away almost all contact with the collections. I note two marked differences from the museum world: entry to the subject is now almost entirely through text and illus- tration, not by seeing or handling the things themselves. As a result, the entry point to discussion and new ideas is not necessarily through the individual object, as it almost invari- ably is for the curator. I am surprised by my slight disquiet at having no collection of my "own" - things that I can play with as I like. Can this really be a hangover from the (rightly) much condemned habit of curators who believed their task was to protect their collections as owners rather than to give access in the manner of librarians? I was long ago described as a "young turk" and had thought myself progressive in these matters. Although progress is surely made in offering access for the noncurator (as in the new ceramic galleries at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, or the Jameel Study Room at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), it remains true that certain types of museum collections are easy of access Cev+i ķ'c+.Ļ 4 č7w(tA lA/um* riattilo, . h obtf&gt;t*et . oí 7 Mú PecteifiJ 7.r * 6 * * 1-0 e*« ^ ') jlacHx -i/uut. ut s Ai ((ô' fr Cik Hu. p f(j^ Ä« /&gt;*/&gt;* Aux/ ( tUltfc TÍU y0&lt;V&lt;K, ř- ¡Mtft {■ b* řplftůf lAůf bfiUsUtjf [ f-loM/ fo Ua#Ai ýfc/r-f ; A-iPt/t* piece òli Wv -ffo O0I/Í4A4 Ï fittCCz ofwoo^f -eo,A 1X7.* 2 co^ ¿«vt/or» fa* (ýú x roeu*) pT ix - A/#-*' /&gt;'«*•&gt; J ^ t; "ép* likt* tf peoPfc-eW*/ L-; H &amp;) ti M" VOJUvuuaa CÙaiaìas i /fťťft fr c) HoUi-k c*t0cu* 0W fW/u. «6t ¿«I &lt;[4* ¡09 ft QU* {4*4 f~(* M Mul« dtetûf li fo *(t tAf+yt fa Çhp wh-et* yo» h+v ofotorr . d[) A/fftv pu ř Ht CAa/Lqm .

It is understandable, perhaps, but nevertheless ironic that direct access is expected and provided through specialist facilities to the most vulner- able and valuable objects but not to those of the more com- mon and cheap materials: it is often much less trouble to gain direct contact with old master drawings or ancient gold coins than with pottery or glass. This does not help the study of a great part of what is covered by the term "Islamic art," nor of decorative arts generally, and as museums come under in- creasing financial pressure, we are bound to see ever shrink- ing numbers of specialist curators who until now have made up the core phalanx of their study. Will universities be willing or able to fill this gap? In unpacking boxes of files built up over the years and waiting to be considered more closely, I came across one of my favorites: awkward objects. This category comprises things whose authenticity is unquestioned but that throw spanners of various sizes at the carefully constructed chronological or geographic frameworks from which our subject is built. The identical type of simple glass vessel found in excavations thousands of miles apart: surely not traded so far? But why so similar? A bronze vessel of a form I discover (from Wikipe- dia!) to be the Archimedean solid a tetradecahedron and not, as impossibly cataloged, having "a dodecagonal body." It has a foot and a tall flaring neck, and twelve of the fourteen faces are engraved (Fig. I).1 The authoritative view of the eminent specialist in the catalog is that the decoration is "typical of Samanid Khorasan," that is, from eastern Iran of the tenth century. But I have a record of exactly the same shape of bottle in pottery: a fritware with turquoise glaze over molded palmettes.2 The ceramic cannot be earlier than the mid- to late twelfth century. Am I to believe that a form as complex as this was made continually for two centuries (es- pecially as no intervening examples survive)? That the potter copied an "antique"? Or is it more plausible that we have our dating schemes very wrong? This possibility is supported by other similarly awkward metal-ceramic correspondences. The metal is dated by stylistic argument alone, the ceramic also by technical. Neither has an absolutely secure basis, though the ceramic framework is more extensive and better buttressed by epigraphic and other evidence. A pottery bowl painted with swirls of colored glaze almost forming a peacock and found in excavations in the ruins of old Cairo is claimed by some archaeologists to be an example of the first Islamic glazed ware found in Egypt (Fig. 2). However, we have accepted for the last hundred years that the glazing of Islamic pottery was a technical revolution inspired by the import of fine Chinese wares into the Persian Gulf in the ninth century. The resulting white-glazed Islamic copies made in Iraq were traded across the Middle East and stimulated local production in provincial styles. But this Egyp- tian dish has no Chinese flavor, is of a late antique shape, demonstrates a different and innovative technique, and is found first in early Islamic layers in Egypt and Syria, and then also in Iraq. I have just submitted an article arguing that our century-old model is back-to-front, that Egypt and Syria have precedence, and that the Chinese wares were, if anything,</page><page sequence="24">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: MATERIALITY 33 3 Colophon of a copy of Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi's Book of Constellations, dated 400 AH (AD 1009-10) and signed al- Husayn ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Umar ibn Muhammad, 10% X 63á in.

A final spanner, this one revealed to us during a seminar last summer given by our distinguished colleague and emer- itus professor of the history of Islamic science Emilie Savage- Smith. It is a privilege of Oxford life to have had such an authority show us one of the most famous of all Islamic manuscripts and a star of the Bodleian Library collections. Marsh 144 is a copy of the famous treatise on the fixed stars by the Persian scholar Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, composed in Shiraz in the 960s. Marsh 144 is of great significance, not only for its splendid set of drawings of the constellations but also for the colophon stating it was copied, possibly by al-Sufi's son, in the year 400 AH/AD 1009-10. This documentary evidence has ensured the prominence of the manuscript, establishing it as the earliest surviving copy of a key scientific text and made within half a century of its composition. It is also (apart from some fragments) the oldest illustrated Is- lamic manuscript to survive, and therefore a keystone in the subject. In a suitably reverent and impressed silence we were shown through the manuscript, until we came to the colo- phon . . . What? This is what its eminence is based on? Dumb- founded, I noted that the final page is a composite with a fragment of medieval paper pasted with later sheets, probably seventeenth-century European, to make up a full page (Fig. 3) . The four-line colophon is in two parts, one giving thanks to God and calling for blessings on the Prophet in a black ink, the second in a red ink giving the name of the copyist and the date. The hand of each seems to differ from that of the main text and from each other, as do the inks. Professor Savage- Smith pointed out that the text on the back of this fragment differs in style and spacing from the text in the rest of the book. She also expressed her unease that the paper of the whole book did not to her feel quite "right" for such an early date, though, as she said, there are few comparanda. Unease expressed by a specialist so experienced in handling such manuscripts should not be lightly discounted. Are we actually dealing with a later medieval facsimile of an earlier text supplied, possibly even later, with a bogus colophon, as was suggested already more than a decade ago by Abolala Sou- davar?4 The experts will no doubt continue to argue, and Savage-Smith will soon be publishing her views in an article on this and the next earliest copy of the text, now in Doha.5 As a nonspecialist, I was struck that so little attention seemed to have been hitherto paid to the colophon as a problematic physical object. Once this documentary anchor had been cut away, our group was able to speculate freely on date and provenance. We followed Savage-Smith on the dating (to the later twelfth century, perhaps?), but on provenance, judging by stylistic considerations of the drawings, we were naturally able to span the Islamic world, from central Asia to North Africa. I myself rather fancied an Egyptian attribution but, more seriously, I hope that further specialist study of this important manuscript will start with a closer examination of the thing itself.

Tristan Weddigen Confronted with postwar movements such as Post-Minimal- ism, feminism, and Arte Povera, which questioned and ex- panded traditional uses of materials, and faced with an al- leged digital dematerialization of contemporary reality, tnaterials have become a field of art historical research, to which Monika Wagner has signally contributed. Textiles are not only part of this new field, but, more interestingly, they also challenge established notions of artistic material. A fab- ric is commonly called a material. Being a technological product and not a raw material, however, the label "textile" is correct only in the metaphoric sense of designating anything, processed or not, that can be used in the manufacture of something else, such as clothes. But, raw material itself being irrelevant to a definition of "textility," and used to designate equally wickerwork, written text, and metal curtains in archi- tecture, textiles should rather be defined by specific tech- niques of production. Then again, the techniques of assem- bly implied in embroidery, in weaving, or in connecting the World Wide Web are so diverse that we need to operate with a vague "family resemblance." Textiles are also often under- stood as a specific medium of art. Yet this definition tends to reduce textiles to material neuters and flattened carriers of visual information - rather the opposite of the meaning con- noted by the materiality of mediums that is the focus of today's scholarship. So, "the textile" is a hybrid under which properties are often strung together - material, technology, medium, and metaphor - and only rarely does it refer to one of these in isolation. The study of textiles consequently re- quires a wide range of methodologies, and it must concern itself with a vast array of objects.1 The history of artists' materials contributes to the study of material culture. Over time, the appreciation and meaning of materials and mediums can drastically change. The textile decoration of sacred and profane interiors in early modern Europe is a prominent case in point. Back then, textiles were arguably the most important and expensive means of repre- sentation, apart from architecture itself. With the end of the ancien régime and the emergence of modernist aesthetics, textiles have slowly withdrawn from interior design. More- over, the textile medium was already marginalized in the aesthetic discourse with Leon Battista Alberti 's rejection of material in favor of pure artistic form, with the rise of Italian idealist "disegno" theory, with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's spiritualization of art, and with the succeeding modernist primacy of painting among the visual arts, which contributed to its fading, in both art and research, until today. Nonetheless, an emerging history of artistic materi- als is not content with technological analysis, iconography, or the history of design, but will probably move toward a more comprehensive iconology of materials and history of objects.2 A more phenomenological approach to late medieval and early modern textile interiors shall be sketched here in order to illustrate the potential of an iconology of materials and, more specifically, the possible relation of materials to some- thing as abstract as space. In order to look back to a vanished textile culture, we might start with its modern reception. In his Arcades Project , left unfinished at his death in 1940, Walter Benjamin critically analyzes the late nineteenth-century French intérieur. Referring to Theodor W. Adorno' s habilita- tion thesis on S0ren Kierkegaard, published in 1933, which portrays the bourgeois flaneur and his inauthentic interiority, Benjamin characterizes the Parisian apartment as the surro- gate of a domes ticized public space, such as an arcade, the- atrically costumed in fabrics. In Benjamin's account, the upholsterer's art fights against modern glass and iron archi- tecture, disintegrates architectural space itself, and trans- forms it into an arachnean cocoon or uterine cave. According to him, the prototype of the historicist dwelling is not the house but the case or container ("Gehäuse"), the silk-lined etui, sheath, or capsule ("Futteral"), which holds the imprint of their occupants and receives the traces of their lives. Benjamin's Arcades Project , an archaeology of the bourgeois culture that amassed and commodified all styles dating be- fore the Restoration, layers a modernist stance onto medieval and early modern notions of interior space. Benjamin might have also been aware of Adolf Loos' s article "Interior," first published in 1898 and again in 1921 and 1931, which adopts Gottfried Semper' s anthropological clothing principle ("Bekleidungsprinzip"), as laid out in his Style of 1860/63, and his notion of "truth to materials." What matters most here is that Loos demands the architect start by imagining the emotional impact of the planned interior spaces that are developed from basic decorative elements, such as carpets. Only thereafter shall the architect conceive of a tectonic structure to sustain or "wear" those interior spaces.3 Norbert Elias's understanding of dwelling structures as socially inflected and of spatial dispositions as materializa- tions of communication structures and social formations, which he expounded in his Court Society of 1969, has been foundational to the sociology of space and to the study of architecture. Still, while he stresses decorum as the expression of negotiated and regulated social distinction, he says little about decoration.

Indeed, in premodern resi- dences, habitable spaces or cubicles are constituted by lining a building's architectural cavities with fabrics. The alcove appears as a mise en abyme of such textile spaces, a phenom- enon that contradicts the Renaissance notion of architecture as transparent geometric space. Thus, Benjamin's analysis of the historicist interior and Loos's conception of architectural space as perceived from within are useful for overcoming two common approaches in scholarship: one that views tapestries as autonomous, decontextualized works of art, akin to paint- ings, and another that considers wall hangings as superfluous froufrou disguising architecture. Instead, textile decor should be understood as a most vital element of a cultural "habitus."4 A close reading of late medieval and early modern visual evidence for textile interiors reveals some characteristics of textile spaces, such as the temporal thickness and aesthetic longevity conferred by narrative tapestries; the ability of tex- tile ephemeral microarchitecture, such as baldachins and balconies, to literally turn inside out, in a manner reminis- cent of the topological model of the reversible "sock" de- scribed by Benjamin; and tapestries' function as portable</page><page sequence="27">36 ART bulletin march 2013 VOLUME xcv number 1 iconographie contexts or symbolic spaces fostering a typolog- ical perception of a doubled reality and creating immersive panopticons. The late medieval tradition of courtly "cham- bres," room-filling and often furniture-covering sets of ver- dures, millefleurs, and genre scenes in landscapes, trans- formed bare architectural interiors into loci amoeni , that is, artificial paradises, as Aby Warburg made clear in his essay "Peasants at Work in Burgundian Tapestries" of 1907. Such verdures powerfully suggest the nonarchitectural, spatially am- biguous depth and texture of nature itself. As places of atemporal pleasures and unlikely encounters, they estab- lished a "heterotopy." In Michel Foucault's "Of Other Spaces," a lecture delivered in 1967 and published in 1984, the het- erotopia is exemplified by the garden as a microcosm and the carpet as a mobile garden. On the one hand, the material and colored flatness of wall hangings was to reemerge later, as the modernist "carpet paradigm" of abstract art. On the •other hand, tapestries undulating in the draft, folded, pulled back, or, especially, hung around the corners of a room created a unique, immersive experience of visual depth by warping an otherwise flat or relieflike picture, which offers an alternative notion of illusion based on the materiality of the textile image in which figure and support merge. This medi- um-specific effect, which outdoes perspectivai panel painting, can sometimes be experienced in museums today, but it was observed and documented already by the Limbourg brothers with the greatest perspicacity in the early fifteenth century (Fig. 1). In their January miniature of the Très riches heures for the Duke of Berry, a War of Troy tapestry is hung around the left corner of the room and wrapped up above the chimneypiece so as to suggest that the turret of the city wall protrudes into the room, that the cavalry enters and storms the real space, and that it crushes the enemy into the tapes- try's folds. Tapestries' incongruous and material spatiality adapts to a plurality of moving eyes looking at nonplanar and multifocal images.5 At the turn of the twentieth century, with August Schmar- sow, Alois Riegl, and Heinrich Wölfflin, an art historical concept of space emerges that is not based on architectural and perspectivai definitions and techniques. In combining the "history of seeing" with the history of representational techniques, Erwin Panofsky's Perspective as Symbolic Form in 1927 still offers a master narrative for the history of visual space. Panofsky describes early and high medieval pictorial flatness as a Neoplatonic repudiation of the Aristotelian to- pological notion of place, in favor of a qualitative, bodily two-dimensionality, conceived as an immaterial fabric made of light, lines, and colored surfaces. Late medieval art then discovers the transparency of the picture plane and creates boxes, niches, and textile baldachins in order to form a pictorial and sculptural space for human figures. The transi- tion from medieval discontinuous space to infinite res extensa , from relational space ("Aggregatraum") to absolute space ("Systemraum"), began with the invention of linear perspec- tive and was later theorized by Isaac Newton. As Wolfgang Kemp remarks, pictorial space from Giotto to Jan van Eyck can be described as a carved-out relieflike cavity, furnished with figures and objects, constituted by their reciprocal rela- tion, both spatial and narrational. Here, textiles follow or replace the walls, fabricate alcovelike spaces, and are lifted to open the view through the missing "fourth wall." Early mod- ern perspectivai space, instead, gives a view through a con- tinuum in which textiles, hung or folded, are reduced to two-dimensional planes symbolizing the opaque materiality and deficiency of pictorial representation.6 The fact that textiles defined the experience and idea of interior space from the Middle Ages well into the nineteenth century, as Benjamin and Loos acknowledge, contradicts a one-dimensional, modernist, evolutionary narrative. The re- construction of a premodern "textile discourse," which has been obscured by the paradigm of perspectivai transparency, can profit from phenomenological and topological ap- proaches, as sketched out in Foucault's lecture and explored by Gilles Deleuze, that emerge with the recent "spatial turn" in the humanities and social sciences. Medieval and early modern textile interiors testify to a notion of space as some- thing material, opaque, sensorial, discontinuous, non-Euclid- ean, folded, polyfocal, social, and topological. For instance, Jan Vermeer's boxlike, furnished, textile intérieurs have been recently associated with a relational understanding of space endorsed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Christiaan Huy- gens against Newton's theory. Instead of a longue durée , bodily understanding of space, art history assumes the break- through and pervasiveness of the perspectivai idea of space since the quattrocento, defined as something transparent, immaterial, neutral, rational, uniform, and infinite. In the history of visuality, the instauration of the perspectivai tableau and the idea of absolute space have eclipsed an earlier, but long-lasting textile spatiality, which contemporary art and architecture, today, help to rediscover.7 Tristan Weddigen is professor of early modern art at the University of Zurich ( PhD Technische Universität, Berlin).
