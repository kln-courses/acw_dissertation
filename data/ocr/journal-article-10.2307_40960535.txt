Generous awards from the Institute for Aegean Pre- history and the Knossos Donated Fund of the British School at Athens helped cover the expenses of vase mending, drawing and photography and the last year of writing up. I was fortunate to receive the Vans- Dunlop Scholarship of the University of Edinburgh to support the first stage of writing up this research into a Ph.D. submitted in 1986. A Junior Faculty Develop- ment Leave from Columbia University in 199 1 allowed for continued study at Knossos. The initial impetus for this study came in 1982 when I struggled to fix the dates for Cycladic pottery in Crete and Mervyn Popham suggested that 'Someone must come to grips with the MM pottery from Evans' exca- vations', in the same way he had dealt with the LM HI pottery from Knossos. Throughout the many years since the first box of sherds was poured out onto a strewing table in the Stratigraphical Museum to their descrip- tion and interpretation in this text I have benefited from the kindness, knowledge, expertise and patience of very many scholars and friends whom I wish to acknowl- edge here with my warmest gratitude. Peter Warren and Petros Petrakis taught me how to study pottery in the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos where Pat Cameron, Christine Morris and Alan Peatfield assisted with the nuts and bolts of working there. Henry Davis helped with the strewing and mark- ing of sherds and Jeff Clarke drew the majority of the examples illustrated in PLATE 130. The typology fig- ures in Chapter 2 are by Alesia Margolis, the patterns are my own. Work in the Herakleion Museum was facilitated by the permission of the Greek Ministry of Culture, the successive Ephors, Professor Iannis Sakellarakis and Dr. Charalambos Kritsas, who provided the assistance of Alexandra Karetsou, Nota Dimopoulou, Giorgos Rethemiotakis and Antonis Papadakis. In the Ashmolean Museum, Ann Brown and Michael Vickers kindly dismantled the pottery display (on more than one occasion) for me and provided the photographs from the Evans Archive reproduced here by kind per- mission of the Visitors of the Ashmolean Museum. Chris Mee alerted me to some surprises in the Mersey- side and County Museum in Liverpool and facilitated their study. Anna Collinge brought to my attention rel- evant material in the Irish collections, as did Leslie Fitton in the British Museum. I benefited from the warm hospitality of Rachael and Sinclair Hood and Jeff Clarke in Oxford, Christa and Chris Mee in Liverpool and Pat Cameron in London. Putting the work together was greatly assisted by Douglas Babbington-Smith and Sheila Raven with the plates and Ann Aertssen who helped compile the con- cordances. During the course of the museum study and subse- quent write-up I profited much from discussions with the 'Knossians' of the School, especially Gerald Cadogan, Nicolas Coldstream, Vronwy Hankey, Sinclair Hood, Colin Macdonald, Nico Momigliano, Mervyn Popham, Hugh Sackett and Peter Warren and with many colleagues who shared their discoveries and ideas over the years, most notably Stelios Andreou, Dorothea Arnold, Maria Avgouli, Robin Barber, Phil Betancourt, Filipo Carinci, Hector Catling, Stella Chrysoulaki, Ellen Davis, Jack Davis, Peter Day, Nota Dimopoulou- Rethemiotakis, Jan Driessen, Doniert Evely, Lisa French, Olga Hadjianastasiou, Robin Hägg, Peter Jablonka, Richard Jones, Athanasia Kanta, Alexandra Karetsou, Bobby Koehl, Manfred Korfmann, Ariane Marcar, Nanno Marinatos, Marisa Marthari, Jean- Pierre Olivier, Angelia Papagiannopoulou, Olivier Pelon, Ingo Pini, Edith Porada, Jean-Claude Poursat, Giorgos Rethemiotakis, Iannis and Efi Sakellarakis, Metaxia Tsipopoulou, Iannis Tzedakis, Lucia Vagnetti, Henri Van Effenterre, Sarah Vaughan, Vance Watrous, Malcolm Weiner, Judith Weingarten, Ian Whitbread, David Wilson and Carol Zerner. To all I am grateful. The relative chronology proposed here owes a very great deal to the Knossos 'Sherd Nerds' who met at Nico Momigliano's instigation in the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos in July 1992 to review pottery groups of the EM and MM periods at Knossos (Cadogan et al 1993). The methods we employed per- suaded me to alter the terminology for certain groups discussed below and, I trust, helped to correct serious</page><page sequence="14">1 4 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS errors in previous versions of this work and relevant publications (MacGillivray 1984a; 1990). Colin Macdonald generously shared his knowledge of the MM pottery from his recent excavations in and around the palace at Knossos. Nota and Giorgos Rethemiotakis kept me informed of their findings in Lasithi and were al- ways ready to discuss the significance of the Knossos- Lasithi link. Ken and Diana Wardle very kindly shared their discovery in 1995 and 1996 of a deposit very simi- lar in context and composition to the Early Chamber beneath the West Court and convinced me that it really does represent a distinct style and period in the Knossian sequence. The absolute chronology owes a very great deal to Vronwy Hankey who provided an advance copy of K. A. Kitchen's latest dates and to Sturt Manning who provided advance copies of his new ideas combining C- 14 and dendrochronology to allow for the ancient his- tory that concludes Chapter 3. The review of Creto- Egyptian relations owes much to Dorothea Arnold, Leslie Fitton, Christine Lilyquist, Vronwy Hankey and Stephen Quirke. The concentrated effort necessary to revise and com- plete this manuscript was made possible by a Visiting Fellowship at All Souls College in Oxford in 1995-96 and I am most grateful to Warden Davies and the Visit- ing Fellows Committee for their confidence. Nico Momigliano and Sturt Manning read and sent detailed comments on the latest draft, which was then whipped into its present shape by Bill Cavanagh, Rayna Andrew, Doniert Evely and Holly Parton. I am deeply grateful to all for their time and energy spent correct- ing my grammar and oversights. Finally, I am most indebted to Robin Barber and Sinclair Hood who supervised the earlier version of this work into a PhD thesis and without whose constant en- couragement (and gentle pressure) it never would have been completed. It gives me the greatest pleasure to dedicate these fruits of my labours to those who planted the seeds and trimmed the branches. Oxford, June 1996</page><page sequence="15">Preface In 1900 Sir Arthur Evans began large scale excavations into the tell site of Tseleve he Kephala at Knossos. Dur- ing the succeeding five years he cleared much of an Aegean Bronze Age structure he identified as the pal- ace of the legendary King Minos. Tests beneath the floors and paved areas of the Late Bronze Age complex revealed a long, complex history of occupation on the tell, much disturbed by the Middle Bronze Age foun- dations and early floors of the palace. Evans, with his field director Duncan Mackenzie, paid close attention to the stratigraphy in the tests. In 1905 he proposed an outline for a chronological scheme of the Bronze Age in Crete that he called Minoan: 'As indicating the prob- able duration of successive dynasties of priest-kings, the tradition of which had taken abiding form in the name of Minos' (1905^). In the absence of written history but in imitation of the Egyptian dynastic sequence, Evans set out three broad periods of Early, Middle and Late Minoan with a further sub-division of three, to reflect historical events and changes as extrapolated from the archaeological record. The MBA walls and floors on the tell became known as the 'Old Palace', the later repairs and newer walls and floors became the 'New Palace'. The most distinc- tive pottery found in Old Palace levels was a finely made polychrome decorated ware very much like that found in earlier excavations in the Kamares Cave (Mariani 1895; Myres 1895), and so&gt; during the early years of excavation, the period of the Old Palace was referred to as the 'Kamares Period' and the fine pottery called 'Kamares Ware'. In Evans' Cretan Bronze Age sequence the Old Palace was seen to belong to the Middle Minoan period, more specifically to MM I B, II A and II B, and the New Palace, constructed late in MM HI, belonged essentially to the Late Minoan period. Evans' Minoan chronological framework soon be- came the standard for all prehistoric sites in the Aegean, and attempts were made to set the historical sequences elsewhere in a similar order, on the basis of ceramic imports from Crete. It was not long before problems in synchronization became apparent and the stratigraphy observed at Knossos called into question. Joseph Hatzidakis suggested that Evans' Early and Middle Minoan periods should be combined because he had found pottery from both periods together at Gournes and Tylissos (191 8, 56-7; 1934, 75). Andonis Zois later re-studied the material and concluded that it belonged to various apparently unrelated deposits and ranged in date from the EM II to MM I B periods (1969, 34). In 1933 Nils Âberg dismissed much of the evidence ob- served by Evans and Mackenzie and grouped the three phases of the Old Palace period into one that he called the 'Kamares Phase' (1933). Àberg's proposal was soon refuted by John Pendlebury who re-affirmed the valid- ity of the stratigraphie sequence at Knossos as he him- self had observed in his own excavations there (1939, xxxi-xxxii). Problems arose again in the 1950's when a previously undiscovered wing of the Bronze Age palace at Phaistos was cleared by Doro Levi. Previous excavations at Phaistos by Federigo Halbherr and Luigi Pernier, car- ried out at the same time as Evans' major work at Knossos, had uncovered a contemporary palace and a sequence of construction and destruction horizons simi- lar to those described by Evans at Knossos (Pernier !935; Platon 19490). Levi's excavations revealed an undisturbed wing of the MBA in which he defined four ceramic phases, none of which appeared to correspond to Evans' MM HI A period. He concluded that the pe- riod did not exist at Knossos either and further specu- lated that the Old Palace at Knossos had been destroyed in MM HI B and not MM II B as Evans and Pernier had suggested (Levi i960). Nicolas Platon (1962; 1968) and Andonis Zois (1965; 1968) were quick to criticize Levi's interpretation of the levels at Phaistos. They suggested that two of Levi's periods, Ib and II, belonged to the same phase and rep- resented upper and lower floors of a single destruction event. They also felt that the newly discovered wing had suffered the same fate as the previously excavated areas of the palace at Phaistos, but failed to agree be- tween them on the date. Zois proposed that the destruc- tion took place during his 'Ripe Classical Phase' which corresponds to Evans' MM II A period. Platon com- pared the material from the final destruction to MM II B at Knossos and suggested that both palaces suf- fered the same fate at the same time (1962, 127). Gisela Walberg has reviewed the Phaistos stratigraphy, for her study of the Middle Minoan pottery from the site, and accepts Levi's interpretation of the stratigraphy so that her 'Classical Kamares' stage may be seen to include three of Evans' ceramic periods (1976, 96-125; 1988).</page><page sequence="16">1 6 PREFACE An alternative to Levi's interpretation of the Phaistos stratigraphy was put forward by the excavation's archi- tect, Enrica Fiandra (1962, 1980). Fiandra also proposed four periods, called 1 to 4, but compared them closely to Evans' Knossos sequence. I have found that Fiandra's architectural and ceramic phasing makes the most sense both in terms of Levi's observations at Phaistos and my own impressions of Knossos, so references to com- parative material and events at Phaistos in the follow- ing pages are given using Fiandra's periods and not Levi's. One of the major stumbling blocks towards a con- sensus on the problem of Middle Minoan chronology is understanding the definitions of Evans' ceramic phases at Knossos. He used less than 100 vases and only a few groups of sherds to illustrate the characteristic ceramics of the Old Palace period, and there are several instances, when he changed his mind on the dating of certain pieces. The resulting discord, then, is hardly surprising. This book presents the first results of over a decade of research, initially conceived to refine the chronology of the appearance of Middle Minoan pottery in the Cycladic islands and Cycladic products in Crete. The first has since been admirably studied and published by Angelia Papagiannopoulou (1991) and one aspect of the other side of the coin by myself (1984a). At an early stage of the research it became apparent that the Cycladic framework I sought to clarify could not be considered without a full re-investigation of the Knossos stratigraphy and a new study of Middle Minoan pot- tery. I changed the focus of the research design from the Cyclades to Crete and began the task of re-group- ing some of the main deposits assigned by Evans and Mackenzie to the Old Palace period at Knossos. The initial aim was to determine their stratigraphie posi- tion, and analyse the pottery groups from these depos- its, to allow for a discussion of such basic issues as the relative chronology and early history of the palace at Knossos. Verification in the form of recent excavations at Knossos (Popham 1974; Catling et al. 1979; Warren 1980; Hood 1994), Archanes (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1 991) and Kommos (Betancourt 1990), and a re- work- ing of the well-published and indexed excavations at Phaistos (Levi 1976, 1980, Levi and Carinci 1988) all suggest that the sequence proposed by Mackenzie and Evans may continue to be acceptable with minor altera- tions. The following re-investigation of their work at Knossos illustrates not only their powers of observa- tion and perception, but also the concern they took over accurate records and conservation with future genera- tions of sceptical scholars in mind. Had they not stored the finds as they did in the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos, the present study would not have been possi- ble. This study has one very limited aim: to place the ceramics from the first major period of the palace's his- tory in a relative and continuous sequence, based on their immediate archaeological context here defined as stratigraphical/depositional, technical and stylistic. The suggested sequence is applicable to Knossos. The deposits and pottery selected for this study re- flect the specific aims stated above. Much material re- mains in the KSM and elsewhere for those who may have other questions to ask of it and are as privileged as I have been to work on it. Oxford, June 1996</page><page sequence="17">I Re-investigation of archaeological contexts INTRODUCTION The early history of the palace at Knossos has been reconstructed on the basis of trials beneath the rela- tively well-preserved renovations of the New Palace period. Disturbances, probably caused by an earthquake and the subsequent re-building activities at the end of the Old Palace period, have made an overall understand- ing of the structure's initial appearance quite difficult. Nonetheless, Evans was confident about the early date of many of the foundations and included them in his schematic plan of the palace in its first phase, repro- duced here in FIG. i.i. Fig. i.i.

The primary aim of this re-investigation is to re-evalu- ate the early history of the palace and its relation to contemporary sites in central Crete. For this reason, only pottery is considered here and used as an indica- tor of relative date, interaction and change. The pot- tery, from a selection of the main deposits, assigned by Evans to the Old Palace period, is assembled into Groups A to P and used to suggest the relative dates of those groups. Deposits which had been assigned by Evans to the MM I period, and thus thought to be ear- lier than the first palace, were not included in the present study. Recent research by Momigliano (1991), however, has shown that many of these should have been treated. As these are published in detail by her, they will be re- ferred to in summary and her conclusions incorporated into the discussion. Likewise, other relevant groups at Knossos not treated in detail are referred to only when considered to be relevant to the limited aims of this work. The 16 groups of pottery discussed in detail below come from deposits excavated by Evans, Mackenzie and Pendlebury between 1901 and 1930. In the absence of detailed plans, photographs and true stratigraphie sec- tions, it is not possible to know for certain how these deposits were formed. Some seem to represent primary deposits on floors, for example the Early Chamber be- neath the West Court (Group A) and some floors in the rooms of the Royal Pottery Stores (Groups F to I). Oth- ers are cumulative deposits, that is an accumulation of material withdrawn from use over time, for example the North- West Pit (Group D), while others may com- prise re-deposited material used as fill, for example the West and South Polychrome Deposits (Groups E and N). Given the additional possibility that the finds may have become contaminated during subsequent study and storage, or even during excavation, caution of the sort advised by E. French (1987) is exercised here and the material is re-assembled to form 'groups' rather than deposits or contexts. The pottery groups are re-assembled by means of three sources of information: • publications, the excavator's notebooks and photographs, and • the pottery itself. The first source includes detailed preliminary reports of the early campaigns (Evans 1 900-1 9050), summa- ries of the pottery from the same years (Mackenzie 1903, 1906), and the final reports (Evans 1921-35). The second source includes the excavation notebooks, or Day-Books (DB) kept by Evans and Mackenzie, cur- rently stored in the Ashmolean Library, Mackenzie's pottery notebooks (PB) in the library of the British School at Athens in Athens, and the photographs of groups of restored vases and sherds in the Evans Ar- chive of the Ashmolean Museum. Mackenzie described a number of individual pieces in his pottery notebooks which can be identified in the material studied. Also, he and Evans occasionally wrote contexts on vases and sherds in a hard lead pencil, which remain legible and help to suggest the find spots for a number of vases, which otherwise would have been considered without provenance. Pendlebury also wrote on most of the whole vases. The relevant inscriptions are given in the cata- logue entries in APPENDIX I and listed separately in AP- PENDIX III. In all cases the graffito confirms the sus- pected or published context of the inscribed piece. Evans' photographs of the pottery are useful in re-as- sembling groups, because many vases in a group pho- tograph can be shown to come from the same deposit, and so allow for the suggestion that the others in the same photograph most likely come from the same con- text and should be included in the group. In the case of some vases, the photographs are the only record of their existence as they can no longer be traced. As the interpretation of Evans' and Mackenzie's notes and publications has become rather like debating the meaning of holy scriptures, the third source, the pot- tery itself, is perhaps the most valuable. It was kept in separate lots in the storerooms of reconstructed areas of the palace and surrounding buildings, and formed the nucleus of the Knossos Stratigraphical Museum (KSM). Some of the pottery was mended for publica- tion and sent to the Herakleion (then Cândia) Museum. Some vases and a great number of fragments were sent to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (Lamb 1936), the British Mu- seum in London (Forsdyke 1925), the Liverpool Mu- seum (Mee and Doole 1993) and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Subsequent exchanges have dispersed fragments to public collections in Swe- den (Aström and Holmberg 1985), Ireland (Johnston 1973) and the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels (Laffineur 1976). The remaining vases and fragments were boxed by Pendlebury and arranged into the ordered system listed in his guide to the Knossos Stratigraphical Museum (1933). These were moved to the new Stratigraphical Museum near the Villa Ariadne in 1963-5 and re-boxed, labelled and shelved in Pendlebury's order, allowing them to be consulted with much greater ease than before (Popham 1970a, 12). None of the deposits of the Old Palace period had been strewn or studied in detail, so this was the first step in the present re-investigation. As with Fur ness (1953) and Popham (19700), it was found that there were errors in labelling, but that these could be corrected, when a complete deposit was studied. Some boxes were found to be unrelated to the others assigned to a given Group and had to be put aside. Others were found to join with Groups assigned to other areas. The contents and labelling of boxes has not been altered, but what are believed to be the correct groupings of boxes are listed in APPENDIX II.</page><page sequence="19">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 1 9 Once the labelling problems were overcome, many 'new' vases were mended and fragments in the boxes were found to join published vases in other museums, either confirming a known context, or suggesting a likely find spot for some well-known pieces hitherto without exact provenance. A list of joins between museums is given in APPENDIX VI. It should be noted that these joins are suggested on the basis of photographs, draw- ings and tracings made of the sherds in the various museums. None of these joins has been physically ex- ecuted. Mackenzie began to inventory the pottery in 1902 with vases K.i to K.29 (1902 PB (2), 68-76, 79-80). The present study takes on where he left off; vases and sherds have been marked with a series of numbers end- ing with K.1078. The inventory numbers were used to facilitate the cross-references of joins and parallels dur- ing the re-investigation. They are superseded here by the catalogue sequence in APPENDIX I; a concordance between catalogue and inventory numbers is given in APPENDIX IV. In the following chapter the most complete and use- ful Groups from the Old Palace are described. Frequent reference to the types, wares and stylistic groups set out in Chapter 2 is necessary here, to allow for discus- sion of the likely relative date of each Group. The full catalogue of inventoried pottery is in APPENDIX I. It was not possible to catalogue all of the pottery. Some deposits are treated in full but others, that were con- sidered to be badly mixed, have only a selection of vases in the catalogue. Some examples that could not be lo- cated but appear in Evans' photographs are included here because of their close resemblance to known types. Many examples could not be included because of the uncertainty of their find context. A number of pieces were selected for drawing (PLATE 130), because of their form or because they did not reproduce satisfactorily in photographs. The majority of the pottery is illus- trated in photographs in PLATES 31-156. Only a very small percentage of the inventoried pottery is not illus- trated, in most cases because close parallels could be cited among the other vases from Knossos, or because they have been well-illustrated elsewhere. The likely contexts of the Groups are discussed and relative dates are suggested on the basis of their stratigraphie context, the analyses in Chapter 2, and comparison with reliable deposits at Phaistos. The meaning of the Groups can only be alluded to in some cases, because most were sorted by Mackenzie who re- jected great quantities of both fine and coarse fragments, so that the true nature of the deposits cannot be known. PART 1. THE EARLY HOUSES BENEATH THE WEST COURT The West Court was identified and the S end partially cleared in 1900. It was then said to comprise 'Consid- erable remains of irregular paving', and an altar base (Evans 1900, 9-10). In 1904, Mackenzie supervised a series of stratigraphie trials including what Evans described as a 'Section beneath the court', in an area 6.50 m to the W of the first altar base, where the tops of walls had become visible, through weathering, since the area had first been opened four years earlier (Evans 1904, 6). The stratigraphie sequence revealed here was to become an important part of the standard framework for the rela- tive chronology of the Cretan Bronze Age, and the notes kept were particularly detailed. The area of the tests has been filled-in and no de- tailed plan survives. However, it is possible to suggest their approximate location using four sources: • Mackenzie's description of the trials and his sketches (1904 DB, plans opp. 18, 32, 34), • Pendlebury's sketch plan (1933, Plan 4), • a photograph of the later trials in the West Court taken from horse-back shortly after 1930 (Pendlebury 1939, pl. XVI. 3; Evans 1935, 61 fig. 36) and • an aerial photograph also taken some time after 1930 (Evans 1935, opp. xxvi). The information from these sources is used to place the likely locations of the trials as suggested in the sketch plan in FIG. 1.2. The first test pit was sunk in an area about 15 m from the West Facade of the palace, FIG. 1.2, no. 1. The material from the upper levels contained mixed MM and EM pottery, but a floor at 1.60 m from the surface produced pottery of EM II A date (Wilson 1984, 31). A trial in this area in 1969 uncovered an EM ter- race wall, FIG. 1.2, CC (J. Evans 1972, 1 16-17 fig- l Tr. 1). A modern fill was observed to the W of the wall and it was suggested that the fill may have been deposited m I955&gt; perhaps during N. Platon's programme of re- construction work in the palace (Hood 1955, 16). It seems quite likely, then, that the W end of the 1969 trial cut into part of Mackenzie's first test pit of 1904, that had been backfilled in 1955. The location of the early TP suggested in FIG. 1 .2 is partly based on this assump- tion. TP 2 was located about two or three metres to the NE of TP 1, FIG. 1.2, no. 2. Here Mackenzie found a mixture of EM II and neolithic pottery. In the W side of the test there was a wall, on a roughly N-S axis, con- tinuing to a depth of 0.70 m from the surface of the court, and built on top of an earlier wall on the same alignment. The later wall was probably EM II to judge from the associated pottery and may have been a con- tinuation of the EM II A terrace wall found in the 1969 trial. This would explain why TP 2 entered EM II strata immediately below the surface of the court. The ter- race was probably levelled and filled-in at the end of</page><page sequence="20">20 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS nrzzzz.1 ■ r 1 /"«"TI »i |ALTAR ■ r 1 1 »i i fi raft n / • / ¡~--j ""!

It then seems to have served as an open space throughout the subsequent life of the site. This post-EM II A terrace may be the earliest ancestor of the West Court and suggests an open area in the EM II B period similar to, and contemporary with, that ob- served at Vasiliki (Branigan 1970a, 44). TP 13 was located to the W of the altar base, prob- ably to the N of TP 2, FIG. 1.2, no. 13. Here Mackenzie found EM II pottery in the first and second metres. This has since been more specifically assigned to the EM II A period and associated with the EM West Court House (Wilson 1984, 177). This test, like 1 and 2, seems to have entered the area of the EM terrace as no MM levels were found. Most of the 1904 trials were located to the Wof 1,2 and 13, and produced quite different results. The sug- gested locations are given in FIG. 1 .2. It was the results of these W trials that formed the basis for Evans' hypo- thetical West Court Section, reproduced here in FIG. 1.3. The aerial photograph of the West Court (Evans 1935, opp. xx vi) shows that the trials in this area were eventually merged. Rather than try to discuss the re- sults of each separately, it may be more useful to sum- marize the sequence of phases observed as a whole. Three phases of the MM period were noted with three associated architectural phases, which are referred to here as Structures 1 , 2 and 3 in order of appearance from top to bottom.</page><page sequence="21">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 2 1 ORIGINAL SURFACE Of GROUND .. :.*. •„•-.• ,atl, |V, i NOAN Stratum . • •■. . ;. : " :ily .. l'-l viy *&gt; _ ¿ •_. •• .

Sketch plan and recon- structed section of building phases observed in 1ÇO4 trials beneath West Court (after Mackenzie 1Ç04 DB (i), opp. 32). Structure 1 The latest building, here called Structure 1, consists of two rectangular rooms 2.40 m wide and 5.00 m long with a common long wall and two separate doors at the N end, not E as reported (Evans 1904, 6). The E wall of the structure appears to continue S beyond the corner shown in Mackenzie's 1904 sketch, which is the basis for the sketch plan in FIG. 1.4 (1904 DB (1) opp. 32). The S continuation and apparent return to the E may have come to light in the 1905 trials, discussed below with Structure 2. This E wall seems to have remained visible until quite recently and is probably the wall shown in J. E vans' plan of the West Court in 1 969 ( 1 972, fig. 1). Only a trace remained when Hood and Taylor (1981) planned the West Court, but enough to allow it to be linked to Mackenzie's sketch plan and to suggest the location of Structure 1 as shown in FIG. 1.2. The walls of Structure 1 begin at the surface of the court, and go down to a depth of 1 .00 m below the level of the court, stopping at a floor at this level. The floor levels associated with the structure were found at a depth of c. 1 .00 m below the surface of the court in a number of tests. The absence of fine 'Kamares' pottery and the tendency toward monochrome decoration in the material led Mackenzie and Evans to date the build- ing to the MM III period (Mackenzie 1906, 266-7). This was supported by the discovery of a group of large, coarse, spouted jars, which they compared to similar shapes from the North-East Magazines. However, the jars were found at a depth of 1.35 m below the court</page><page sequence="23">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 23 and should be associated with Structure 2, discussed below. The pottery from the first metre of deposit in TP 3 and 12, stored in the Knossos Stratigraphical Museum, is almost entirely plain wares and crude types of the MM II B- III A periods. The pottery from the first two metres of TP 1 1 is for the most part very fine and can be conclusively assigned to the MM II B- III A periods, because it joins with ma- terial from elsewhere and forms part of the West Poly- chrome Deposits Group that belongs to the final phase of the early houses beneath the West Court (see below, Group E). The exact location of TP 1 1 is uncertain. Pendlebury places it to the S of TP 9 (1933, Plan 4: B I 14). It was probably somewhere in the area NE of Kouloura 1 and SE of TP 9 against the S wall of Structure 1, as sug- gested here in FIG. 1 .2. As there is no pottery later than the MM II B- III A periods associated with the build- ing, it seems most likely that Structure 1 went out of use in MM III, probably early in the period at the same time as the filling operations that took place in the West Court, discussed below p. 33. Structure 2/ House C Traces of an earlier structure, on the same alignment as the latest, were found in the 1904 TP 3, 4, 7, 9 and 12, FIG. 1.4. The tops of the walls of the lower building, here called Structure 2, appeared immediately beneath the floor of Structure 1 at 1.00 m and continued to a depth of 1.50 m below the court with associated floor levels found at depths of 1.35 m, in TP 7 and 12, and 1 .50 m, in TP 4 and 9. Structure 2 consisted of a rec- tangular room, c. 2.00 m wide and 4.15 m long with a door on the W side. The floor at a depth of 1.50 m be- low the court in TP 9, to the S of Structure 2, was asso- ciated with wall 7, which is aligned with the structure and which Mackenzie felt belonged to it. The 1904 report makes no mention of the finds from this building. No date was suggested and Evans referred to it as 'Some intermediate walls of no importance', which lay beneath the first building and above an im- portant deposit at a depth of 1.75 m below the court (1904, 14 n.i). In his description of the pottery, Mac- kenzie lists a group of large spouted jars from the floor at 1.35 m in TP 12 and compares them with similar jars from the North-East Magazines (1904 PB (1), 47- 8). Presumably because of the suspected late date for the pottery, Mackenzie associated it with the most re- cent structure, even though the deposit came from be- low the floors of Structure 1 . On present evidence it would seem best to assign the Group to Structure 2. In 1905 TP 9 was extended to the E as TP 14 and a deposit of MM I pottery was found on a floor level at a depth of 1.20 m below the court (Mackenzie 1907 DB, 1-6; Evans 1905a, 16 fig. 9). On the basis of the MM I deposit Evans subsequently called the walls House C, Houses A and B being the MM I A houses below the Koulouras found by Pendlebury in 1930 (Evans 1935, 85 n.4). Andreou in his study of House C confirms Evans' MM I date for the deposit in TP 9/14 and dem- onstrates that the floor level, at 1 .50 m below the court in TP 1 5 and TP 4, also contained contemporary ma- terial which he assigned to his Kouloura Group or the MM I A period (1978, 28). Momigliano recently re-in- vestigated the 1904 and 1905 trials and speculated that the floors between 1.50 m and 1.20 m in TP 4, 9, 14 and 1 5 belong to within the EM IH-MM I A periods (199 1, 187, 191). To the same Group should be added the floor at 1.35 m in TP 12; the large spouted jars as described by Mackenzie are very similar to examples from Houses A and B below the Koulouras, which can be assigned with confidence to the EM III-MM I A periods (Momigliano 1991,216 p!. 43.15, 226 pls. 51.65, 53.79-80). Structure 2 and House C, therefore, seem to be the same building and belong within EM III-MM I A. The pottery from the floor deposit for the most part com- prises types that are found in the EM III repertory, but there are at least two vases which indicate a later date. The first is a miniature angular bridge-spouted jar deco- rated with thick orange and thin white bands on the body and alternating white and orange vertical strokes on the rim, in a manner very similar to the decoration on a footed goblet from the area of House B (Momigliano 1991, 213 pl. 54 no. 121); this has close parallels among the sherd material from what is reported as the lowest level in the Monolithic Pillar Basement (Mackenzie 1906, pl. 7 nos. 14, 15). The second vase is a large jug with an elaborate design comprising a thick orange wavy line with vague diagonal motifs resembling double-axes outlined in white and red and filled with white dots on the shoulder (Evans 19050,0^9.1; 1921, 174 fig. 123a). There are no exact parallels for the de- sign, but the method of filling in a motif with carefully spaced white dots is found on sherds from the Mono- lithic Pillar Basement, in a style that might be called 'Polychrome Geometric', and which should be taken to represent the fine decorated pottery of the late MM I A period (Mackenzie 1906, pl. 7 nos. 3, 4; Evans 1921, 177 fig. 125 no. 5) (for a discussion of this style and its implications see Chapter 2, Part 4). Momigliano points out that the jug was lifted and partially restored before being set back into place for a photograph of the floor deposit (1991, 190-1 pl. 32). This certainly seems to be the case and suggests that the location and exact context of the jug was 'fudged' for the photograph. However, the same cannot be said for the miniature bridge-spouted jar which appears un- washed and still filled with soil in the same photograph. The jug may have been encountered at an earlier stage of clearing the room, perhaps at the end of the previous day, and Evans felt justified to recompose it and set it in place when the full extent of the floor deposit had been cleared. In any case, the miniature jar alone con- firms a terminus post quern late in the MM I A period for the deposit.</page><page sequence="24">24 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS Structure j Traces of a third building, here called Structure 3, ap- peared in a few places under Structure 2. It consisted of one long N-S wall about 9.00 m in length with a door- way at the N end. The lower E-W wall at the N end of TP 3 was seen to belong to this building as well as wall 6, an E-W wall under wall 7 in TP 9, FIG. 1.4. The tops of the walls lie immediately below the floor of Struc- ture 2 at a depth of 1.50 m and continue to an associ- ated floor at a depth of c. 2.00 m from the court. Mac- kenzie described the pottery from the floor at 2.00 m as 'The early Minoan geometric pottery' (1904 DB, 42), a description frequently applied to the decorated wares of the EM III period. Structure 3 seems to be the build- ing described by Evans in the 1904 report, although again he appears to have confused the points of the com- pass (1904, 18-20). Andreou in his study of the material from the early floor encountered in TP 14 and 15, which seems to be associated with this structure, assigned it to his Upper East Well Group, which he regarded as characteristic of the EM HI period (1978, 14). Momigliano's re-in- vestigation concluded that there was no distinction be- tween Andreou's EM HI and pre-polychrome MM I A pottery groups and that they probably belong to one period, which she tentatively called EM HI/MM I A (1991, 268). The most recent re-appraisal of Knossian ceramics of this period suggests that Andreou's Upper East Well Group should be regarded as stylistically ear- lier than groups with the first use of polychrome deco- ration, and may thus be equated with EM III (Cadogan et al. 1993,24-5). It is interesting to note that Structure 3 is aligned very closely with the walls of Houses A and B below the Koulouras. The floor level in the E room of House B is only 0.23 m higher than the floor in House A. The steps, leading to the E from the room with the central depression in House A, are preserved to a level less than 1 .00 m apart from the floors in Structure 3; they may have continued for the necessary four steps to arrive at the same level, but were cut off when the second Kouloura was built. As Momigliano has shown that the pottery deposits from all three structures are contem- porary, and the alignments are quite similar, Structure 3 and Houses A and B may be part of the same archi- tectural complex. In any case, Structure 2/House C post-dates the EM III deposits in Structure 3 and in the Houses below the Koulouras. Group A. The Early Chamber Beneath the West Court Context As luck would have it, the largest and most important group of pottery from the 1904 trials did not come from any of the floors encountered in the three structures described above. It came from a deposit at a depth of 1.75 m below the West Court inside the W room of Structure 1 in TP 4, but could not be linked with any of the architectural phases. The deposit consisted of over a hundred vases stacked and piled in order, as shown in the drawing in FIG. 1.5. It continued under the middle dividing wall of Structure 1 into the area of the E room, and was thus shown to be earlier than Struc- ture 1. It also continued to the S under the S wall of Structure 2, and so seemed to be earlier than that build- ing as well. At the time, the pottery was compared with that from the Royal Pottery Stores and assigned to the MM II period. The problem with the date was that it failed to explain how a MM II deposit might pass un- der the wall of a MM I house. Mackenzie resolved the problem by suggesting that the MM II floor cut into the earlier floor (1906, 256). Evans later revised the date of the deposit and called it MM I B, presumably on sty- listic grounds (1921, 186 n. 3, 187-9). The change in thinking may have been possible because the wall that lay over the deposit was described as 'Consisting of rough foundation' (Mackenzie 1904 DB, 32), and Mac- kenzie later may have thought that it was not a wall but rather a line of tumble, which he had taken for a wall because of its alignment with Wall 4 in TP 12. How- ever, it should be possible to accept it as an early wall that was undercut when the later floor was dug into the room. A further problem arises with the material said to come from the second metre in TP 3. The pottery from this test stored in the KSM joins completely with the pottery from the floor 1.75 m from court in TP 4. It seems most likely that the pottery from the two tests comes from a single floor, cut into the earlier floor at 1 .50 m, within the area of the room that is part of Struc- ture 2. This would explain why the floor anticipated at 1.50 m was not observed in most places in the two tri- als, although it was shown to have existed by a frag- ment which remained in situ against the W wall N of the door. Outside the room the sequence fits nicely with the architecture and the three major floor levels associ- ated with the structures described above. The MM I B deposit, within the room at a level lower than the MM I A floor, may have belonged to a cellar or pit cut into the earlier floor of the building. The MM I A floor at 1.50 m was found in one corner inside the room and immediately outside the room on the other side of Wall 4 in TP 12. It may be that the post-MM I A occupants of the area required more storage space, or may have been trying to hide the store of fine pottery that was stacked in this basement. Re-assembly This Group comes from the deposits from the floor at 1.75 m below the court in TP 3 and 4. The pottery from the two trials joins so completely, that they are considered here to belong to the same deposit. The Group was re-assembled by means of published illus- trations (Evans 1904, 15 figs. 4, 5.2; 1921, 187 fig. 136;</page><page sequence="25">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 25 On CO</page><page sequence="26">26 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS Pendlebury 1933, pl. 17 2c, 3 and 4) and one unpub- lished photograph in the Evans Archive, reproduced here in PLATE 32. There is also a sketch of the deposit, which is sufficiently detailed to allow for pottery in the KSM to be identified and assigned to the Group, FIG. IS- Most of the whole vases could be traced. The pub- lished pieces are in the HM and were probably sent as a group and inventoried as such, because they all belong within a close range of numbers in the HM catalogue. Some pieces from the Royal Pottery Stores, Groups F- J, seem to have been inventoried at the same time, but the numbers are generally earlier than those of Group A. The pottery illustrated in PLATE 32 can be included in this Group for the following reasons: • the finds are identified in the top right hand cor- ner as coming from the North- West House indi- cating that they come from the West Court area, • strainer 97 joins the rim of a cup from boxes in the KSM assigned to and joining Group A, and • three of the vases shown, 50, 74 and 145, are in- scribed with 'K.04 W Sq. T.P.3', or 'T.P.4' which records that they come from the same trenches as Group A. The remaining pieces are all of types represented by other examples in the Group and thus most likely be- long to it. Though some of the pieces could not be lo- cated, they are included in the catalogue because they are in recognizable types and are most likely of Fine Buff Fabric. The relevant boxes of pottery from TP 3 and 4 in the KSM (APPENDIX II, B I 6 and 7) were strewn and sorted and in some cases mended. A total of 152 exam- ples were inventoried, 1-152, and are illustrated here in PLATES 1-6 and 31-47. Relative date The poor publication and changing attitudes towards this Group, more than any other at Knossos, are re- sponsible for most of the confusion, that has arisen over the chronology of the early Old Palace period in cen- tral Crete. Mackenzie's first impression of the materi- al's date was that it should be placed with the early floors in the Royal Pottery Stores and the North- West Pit and thus within the MM II A period (1906, 250, 256). Evans revised the date to the MM I B period (1921, 186-9), which was accepted by Pendlebury who used much of the material in this Group to illustrate the typical de- signs on MM I B pottery (1939, 109 fig. 17 pi- 17&gt; 2"4)- Warren and Hankey accepted the MM I B date and treated the Group as representative of the period (1989, 50). Walberg, however, assigned it to her Classical Kamares phase which she equated with Evans' MM II A-II B- III A (1976, 1 19). In recent work, I have fol- lowed Mackenzie's first instincts and placed Group A in an early stage of the MM II A period (MacGillivray 1990), but now believe this must be revised. Much of the pottery is handmade or proto- wheelmade and monochrome coated. The forms in Fine Buff Fabric are the Rounded Goblets of Type 1 (1-7, 15-16) Type 2 (no) and Type 3 (m), Straight-sided Cups of Type 2 (20, 26-30, 37-41, 56-67), Tall-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 1 (31-4, 43 and 70), Short- rimmed Angular Cups of Type 2 (99-101), Rounded Cups of Type 3 (109, 125-6) and Type 4 (108), Angular Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 1 (36) and Type 2 (75), all of which may be taken as typical of the MM I B period. There are also examples of Pared, Barbotine, Shallow Grooved and Early Printed Wares and pottery in the White-banded, Diagonal Red and White and Woven styles, all characteristic of the MM I B period. In Gritty Soft Buff Fabric there are Hand Lamps of Type 1 (148- 51) which also occur in Groups G and L and may be- long to both the MM I B and MM II A periods. There is a noteworthy lack of the characteristic Egg-shell Ware of the Royal Pottery Stores, Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 4 most common in Group L, and the early Crude Types that are so numerous in the MM II A de- struction deposits in the E wing of the palace. A large percentage of the pottery is handmade and there is a possibility that some pieces were manufac- tured in the MM I A period. For example, large spouted jar 146 is very similar to those we now assign to Struc- ture 2/ House C. This may be regarded either as a sur- vivor or as a mixture from the MM I A floor, into which this Group was cut. There are also handmade types such as the Shallow Bowls of Type 1(18, 24) and Convex- sided Cups (42 and 69) which are found only in this Group and could belong to a late stage of MM I A or early MM I B. It is quite certain that the deposition of Group A belongs to a period later than MM I A. As we must as- sign a date using the latest material in the Group, it should be considered MM I B, as concluded by Evans. It seems to belong to a time when there is evidence for a first horizon of destruction by fire in the palace, best demonstrated by the deposit in Early Magazine A at the SW Palace Angle (Catling 1974, 34; 1988, 68; Cadogan et al. 1993, 26) and before the second destruc- tion by fire in the palace, which are taken here to mark the end of the MM II A period. A comparable phase at Phaistos is Fiandra's Period 1 which contains the clos- est comparanda for some of the examples in this Group. It is suggested below (Chapter 3, Part 3) that the term MM I B be retained at both sites. Comment The 1904 TP were designed to recover the earlier stratigraphy of Knossos and did so, although not per- haps as clearly as had been hoped for. The results of the 'section' through the West Court were presented as a reconstructed section showing MM III stratified above MM II which was above EM III, FIG. 1.3 (Evans 1904,</page><page sequence="27">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 27 18 fig. 7). A revised version, based on the observations outlined above, is suggested in FIG. 1.4. It shows MM II B- III A stratified above MM I A and EM III with a cutting into part of the MM I A floor during the MM I B period. Given the complexities of the stratigraphy and problems involved with the manner in which the levels were excavated and the finds stored, this re-as- sessment must be treated as provisional until new trials may be undertaken in the West Court. PART 2. THE NORTH-WEST TREASURY In 1 90 1 the clearing operations in the West Court were extended northward and the large, irregular structure which came to be known as the 'North- West Treasure House' or 'North- West Treasury', FIG. 1 .6, was uncov- ered and a second altar base found nearby (Evans 1901, 5). The main floors of the house were seen to belong to the 'Mycenaean Period' but it was also observed that there were lower floors that were 'Of the pure Kamares Period' (ibid.). Excavations were concentrated on the E slopes of the palace in 1902, but in 1903 were resumed in the North- West Treasury. Evans reports that the upper layers were found to contain pottery of 'the decadent style', char- acteristic of his period of 'partial occupation' (1903, 115). This could be a reference to the LM III B period, for which there is evidence of occupation in the form of two bowls and some sherds (Popham 19700, 60-2).

About 1. 00 m below these was an earlier series of clay floors with 'Kamares' pottery, especially on the W side of the building, where the effects of later level- ling were presumed to have been less destructive (Evans 1903, 115). Mackenzie, in his record of the excavation of the building, noted the sequence of strata, but also the general lack of good floor levels (1903 DB, 64-6). In one room the early floor yielded a 'Spouted two- handled jug' with 'obliquely arranged parallel systems of tooth-bands in relief alternating with similar bands in lustreless cream white and red on a lustrous glaze slip' (ibid. 64). The location is marked 1 on the plan in FIG. 1.6. The vase has not been identified, but the de- scription is reminiscent of the bridge-spouted jars found on the early floor beneath the Room of the Olive Press and assigned to the MM II A period (Group L, 930- 58). The presence of the vase suggests the existence of a MM II A floor beneath the later room. Group B. The Area of the Polychrome Jug Context In a small area to the W of the previous early floor a clay floor at a similar level produced a deposit of cups and jars including one large jar (165) which Evans regarded as 'The most elaborate vase of the polychrome style.' (1904, 18; 1921,247 pl. III). The small room where the vase was discovered became known as the 'Area of the Polychrome Two-handled Spouted Jug'. Mackenzie identified the room as that shown in FIG. 1.6, no. 2. The location given by Evans and Pendlebury is the next room to the S, FIG. 1 .6 B. The present study uses Mac- kenzie's location and, in any case, the exact location is of little importance. Re-assembly This Group has been re-assembled using two photo- graphs published with Evans' report for 1904, repro- duced here in PLATE 48. Four of the published vases could be found. Most of the others belong to recogniz- able types and so are included in the Catalogue. Six- teen vases were inventoried for this study: 153-68 il- lustrated in PLATES 48 and 49. Two cups (155-6) are in boxes #92 and #93 in the KSM along with published jugs (154 and 164) and numerous fragments of fine pottery. The large bridge-spouted jar (165) from which the deposit takes its name is in the HM along with 157. Relative date Mackenzie's first impression was that this Group was contemporary with the Royal Pottery Stores (1906, 256). This was repeated by Evans who assigned jar 165 to the MM II A period (1921 , 247). This date is re-affirmed by the present re-investigation. The pottery includes Rounded Goblets of Type 2 (162-3) and Straight-sided Cups of Type 2 (153, 155- 6) which are found in groups of the MM I B and MM II A periods. The small angular jug (164) is similar in profile to a jug from the floor in West Magazine 2 (Brown 1983, 68-9 AE 977), and may be related to the MM I B jugs with butterfly patterns on the shoulder from the Vat Room Deposit and the Area Encircling the Middle Kouloura, although these are in Fine Buff Fabric (Momigliano 1991, 171, 236). The large bridge-spouted jar (165) is quite similar to early products in a similar tempered fabric from Phaistos, and may originate from there (Pernier 1935, pl. XVIa, b; F 1400). The Phaistos examples belong to Fiandra's Period 2 which marks the end of the MM II A period. Jar 165 and Crude Goblets 158-60 are the latest objects in the Group and provide a likely date in the MM II A period for the deposit. Group C. The Porcelain Deposit Context Pendlebury lists a group of material in the KSM as com- ing from the 'Porcelain Deposit' of the North- West Treasury but does not give a more detailed provenance (1933, 4 B I 17). There is no mention of this deposit in notebooks or publications, so nothing can be said of its context. However, it may be assumed that the pottery most likely comes from an early floor level beneath the North- West Treasury. Re-assembly The contents of the two boxes in the KSM are listed as coming from the 'Porcelain Deposit' in the area of the North- West Treasury (Pendlebury 1933, 5: A II 17). One box, #107, contains mixed pottery ranging from neolithic to LM III. The other, #106, contains numer- ous fragments of fine cups and bridge-spouted jars with polychrome decoration. Two vases whose profiles could be restored (169 and 170) are included in this study and illustrated in PLATE 50. Relative date 170 is a Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 4 with a close parallel in 656 from the Royal Pottery Stores. The decoration on 170 is very similar to that on a Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar of Knossian Type 4 from Phaistos, which belongs to Period 2 (F. 426). Group C, then, should be assigned to the MM II A period and may rep- resent the contents of an early floor deposit similar to Group B. Group D. The North-West Pit Context A large circular pit, filled with fragments of fine MM pottery, was discovered beneath the W rooms of the North- West Treasury and excavated in 1903. It became known as the North- West Pit and a small selection of finds was published (Evans 1904, 16-17 figs. 5Ì, 6; Mac- kenzie 1906, pl. VIII).</page><page sequence="29">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 29 A preliminary examination of the pottery from the area of the pit, now stored in the KSM, shows that finds from the North- West Pit (A II 1, 2) join material from the West Rooms (A II 21) which were built over the pit, the Area S of the Polychrome Jar (A II 10), the West Border of the Area (A II 1 1) and the Area of the Walls (A II) to the W. These deposits are all in the immediate vicinity of the North- West Pit, and suggest that the pit may not have been a regularly shaped feature of one period, but rather an area to the W of the early house beneath the North- West Treasury. Here pottery could have been dumped over an extended period or perhaps thrown against the Western Enceinte Wall, which seems to have come into being at roughly the same time as the earliest pottery found in the North- West Pit (see below pp. 30-2). The area seems to have been used as a pot- tery dump up until the time of the major levelling op- eration in the West Court. It was then built over by the E rooms of the North- West Treasury in the neopalatial period. Re-assembly This Group is a selection of diagnostic fine decorated pieces from among the great quantities of sherd mate- rial kept in the KSM, HM, AM and BM, described by Evans as having come from the North- West Pit. The catalogue includes 90 examples: 171-26 1 illustrated in PLATES 7-8 and 51-60. The Group has been re-assembled using the photo- graph published with Evans' 1904 report, reproduced here in PLATE 51, the colour drawing of fragments of decorated pieces used in Mackenzie's report on the MM pottery - the original photograph of which is repro- duced here in PLATE 52 (1906, pl. VIII), and an unpub- lished photograph in the Evans Archive showing pieces said elsewhere to have come from the North- West Pit, PLATE 53. Also useful was Mackenzie's pottery note- book for 1903, that allowed for the inclusion of bridge- spouted jar 247, still without catalogue number or prov- enance in the HM, but almost certainly the vase de- scribed as having come from the 'N. W. Kamares Area' (ibid., 1903 PB, 3 vase 8). A number of fragments in the AM were said by Evans to come from the North- West Pit; many of these join vases stored elsewhere, for example spouted jar 21 1, of which most fragments are in the AM, has joining fragments in the BM, HM and in three boxes in the KSM. Cross-museum joins are most frequent within this Group, because Evans took it to represent the typical pottery of the MM II A pe- riod, and could illustrate the high quality of 'Kamares Ware' with samples removed and sent to the teaching collections of museums in Great Britain. Most of the joins confirm known attributions, but some produce new and useful information, for exam- ple cup 239 is made up of fragments which had been illustrated as having come from the Gypsades Well (Evans 1921, 595-6 fig. 437a, b), but which join other fragments from boxes assigned to the North- West Pit in the KSM, shown in PLATE 58. This effectively re- moves the only MM II B evidence from the otherwise neopalatial deposit in the well {contra Warren and Hankey 1989, 56). Relative date Mackenzie assigned the North- West Pit to the MM II A period, contemporary with the deposits on the early floors under the nearby North- West Treasury (1906, 256). The material illustrated by Evans could all be con- sidered to belong to the MM I B and MM II A periods as defined in Chapter 2. Group D comprises much ma- terial of those periods, including Straight-sided Cups of Type 2 (173-4, 178-88) decorated in the Woven Style, and numerous fragments in a reserved style with added red and white, e.g. 203-20, that are quite similar to a style common in periods 1 and 2 at Phaistos, but not later (E 85, 1919, 1923, 2082, 2238, 2327, 3685, 5214a, 5330, 5957c; Pernier 1935, 378 fig. 226; Levi 1976, pl. LXIIIc, k, 1). However, stored together in the KSM are also fragments of MM II B wares, styles and types such as 237, a Rounded Cup of Type 5 in Precision Stamped Ware, 239, a Rounded Cup of Type 6 decorated in the Wavy-line Style, and 240-1, Rounded Cups in the Heavy Spiral Style, as well as many fragments of neopalatial pottery. Whether the pit had been a closed group prior to excavation, it is impossible now to know. The MM II B and later material may indicate that it was in use for a long time, perhaps for the duration of the Old Palace period and beyond. Comment In summary, there are at least three floor deposits of similar date and most likely at a similar level beneath the North- West Treasury. They indicate the existence of a building of the Old Palace period at the N end of the later West Court, although, until further excava- tion is conducted to the S, it remains to be seen whether the building was separate or part of an architectural continuum that stretched from the Koulouras to the later Théâtral Area; the latter suggested in a sketch plan of the West Court following the 1930 excavations (Evans J935&gt; 51 fig- 30)- What is clear is that the floor deposits point to a destruction in the area of the North- West Treasury at the end of the MM II A period contempo- rary with similar destruction in the Royal Pottery Stores, as suggested by Mackenzie (1906, 256). The majority of the material in the North- West Pit is contemporary with the destruction groups and could include the rub- bish from the early house. The later rubbish may be associated with the levelling operations that took place in the West Court at the end of the Old Palace period, for which there is evidence from the S part of the court (see Group E below). It is also possible that the pit was not a pit at all, but re-deposited material from occupa- tion and destruction levels within the building cut away when it was re-modelled in the early neopalatial pe-</page><page sequence="30">30 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS riod. This would explain the presence of MM III B and LM I A pottery in the boxes in the KSM. PART 3. THE KOULOURAS, SOUTH FRONT AND NORTH-WEST ACROPOLIS HOUSES The Koulouras Immediately S of the area of the 1904 TP a stone lined circular structure which Evans called a 'Kouloura', was discovered and cleared in 1907 (Karo 1908, 120-1). It was found full of fine pottery sherds assigned by Evans to the MM HI period (1921, 554). An extended excava- tion campaign by Pendlebury in 1930, in the area to the W of the 1904 trials, revealed two more Koulouras and other important structures both contemporary and ear- lier (Payne 1930, 250-1). The two additional Koulouras were laid out in a line to the W of the first, FIG. 1 .7. The Central and Western Koulouras were built over West Court Houses A and B. Both houses were founded on neolithic levels, indi- cating that occupation in EM I and II either didn't ex- ist here, or had been removed prior to construction. The lowest floor deposits have been re-examined by Momigliano who, by means of clever detective work, has rejected much later material previously thought to come from these floors and re-assembled their most likely contents (1991, 206-35). The remaining pottery belongs to the EM III or early MM I A periods. In rooms 1 and 2 of House B, Pendlebury noted two distinct floor levels 0.50 m apart (1930, 58). While it was concluded that both floors belonged to the same ceramic phase, the upper floor was reported to contain polychrome decorated pottery while the lower floor did not (ibid., 60). Momigliano is unable to separate the sherd material which could have come from the upper floor, and rehearses a number of possible scenarios to explain the presence of later material among the stored pottery, finally suggesting that both floor levels belong to the 'EM HI/MM I A' period, as Pendlebury had done (1991, 215). However, the polychrome pottery illus- trated by Pendlebury and said to be from the upper floor, finds close parallels in the 'Polychrome Geomet- ric' pottery from the lowest level in the Monolithic Pil- lar Basement which is characteristic only of the late MM I A period (Cadogan et al 1993, 25-6). The second and final floor, then, may represent occupation late in the MM I A period contemporary with the floor at c. 1.50 m in Structure 2/House C to the E (see above p. 23). This would place the construction of the Koulouras at a late stage of the MM I A period or soon after. The material identified by Momigliano as having come from the 'Area encircling Kouloura IP may provide a con- struction date early in MM I B (1991, 236-8). The cuttings for the Koulouras were all made to a uniform depth of c. 3.00 m below the level of the later West Court, presumably so that they would all have similar internal capacities. As the earlier architecture had been terraced down the slope from E to W, the East Kouloura cut through and removed any prior struc- tures, that may have existed. The Central Kouloura was cut down to a level that removed the E area of House A, but stopped before reaching the lower, S rooms. The Western Kouloura left House B, whose floors were 0.50 and 1 .00 m lower than those preserved in House A, rela- tively undisturbed. When the East Kouloura was built it must have stood at least 1 .00 m above the contemporary floor and ground levels of the houses to the N of it, which at the end of the Old Palace period were still 1.00 m below the level of the later court, as shown by Structure 1 (above, p. 22). The Central and West Koulouras probably also stood partially above ground level and perhaps even more so than the East Kouloura, if the contemporary buildings to the N continued to be terraced during MM II. It is likely that during the Old Palace period all three structures stood higher than the 3.00 m preserved, but were cut off at the level of the West Court, when they were filled in and the court extended, early in the New Palace period. The function of the Koulouras at Knossos and else- where has been much discussed. They have been inter- preted as cisterns, as suggested for the eight similar round structures at Malia (Chapouthier et al 1962, 17- 19) and for the North-West Kouloura at Knossos (Evans 1935, 65-6), or as rubbish pits (ibid.), and granaries (Graham 1962, 134-5 nlI5 Levi 1976, 352). Whatever the original purpose, the Koulouras were found filled with re-deposited rubble and pottery sherds. Evans observed two stages of use in the East Kouloura. The later stage comprised material dumped in during MM III, the earlier use he put in MM II. He concluded that the Kouloura was cleared out at the end of MM II, or a slightly later date contemporary with the material in the other two. It was then used as a dumping place in MM III (1935, 64). Pendlebury tested this hypothesis by excavating the Central Kouloura stratigraphically. He dug the E half first in order to pro- vide a section within the structure but concluded that 'The contents had been tipped over from the N-E cor- ner' at one time (1930, 55 n.i). Pendlebury regarded the pottery as primarily MM II in date, but with ad- mixtures of MM I B and MM HI. This re-investigation of the pottery suggests that the latest material can be assigned to the MM HI A period, but there are numerous examples of MM II B types (see below, Group E). It also shows that the material from the three Koulouras joins so thoroughly that it should all be regarded as having been deposited at one time and coming from the same source. There is no late MM HI material preserved from the East Kouloura. The Western and Southern Enceinte Walls Among the most important features to come to light during the 1930 season were the enclosure or 'Enceinte' walls, FIG. 1.7 (Evans 1935, 49-59 fig. 30). These walls enclosed the area of the later West Court. The Western</page><page sequence="31">RE-INVESTIGATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 3 1 ZUjM^1^ tB^^ ^AVMiyAVD 3DNV31N1 OVOÍs"""] L y i^fc tk^ n &gt; ^? ~i 'HLjJ 2: - q ^ ^ f.

The wall, therefore, was taken to be earlier than MM II A and so Evans placed it in the MM I A period (ibid., 54). The South- ern Enceinte joins the W wall, at an abrupt angle at the SW corner of the court, and runs eastward to the area of the later West Entrance Porch. The S section was con- structed with huge blocks apparently set on virgin soil (ibid., 57-9 fig. 35). There was no stratigraphy men- tioned with the S wall, but it was assumed to be part of the same construction as the W wall and assigned like- wise to the MM I A period. The problem with a MM I A date for the Enceinte walls is that the W wall was built over the SW rooms of House B (ibid., 70 fig. 42), which seem to have gone out of use as late as the end of the MM I A period. Therefore, the wall's construction must post-date the MM I A period. Momigliano points out that rooms 5- 8, previously assigned to the MM I phase of House B and whose construction appears to be contemporary with the Western Enceinte Wall, are stratigraphically later than the MM I house and contained pottery of what is considered here to be the MM I B period (1991 , 210-2; see below. The argument for the early date is weakened further if we consider the section of raised paving, that intersects the Enceinte wall to the S of the Théâtral Area, as part of the building programme that included the construction of the Théâtral Area in MM III A, when the steps were built over the MM II paving and a new route to the N entrance of the palace was required (Damiani-Indelicato 1982, 60). The Western and Southern Enceinte walls, then, seem to belong to the period after MM I A and before MM III A. A date in MM I B may be suggested on the basis of the W wall's connection with rooms 5-8 of House B. This would imply that the walls formed part of the programme of re-organisation in the area of the later West Court which may also have included the con- struction of the Koulouras. The Southern Enceinte goes out of use following its destruction by earthquake (Evans 1935, 58). Although no stratigraphy or pottery is mentioned in connection with the destruction, Evans states that the South- West House, directly to the S of the wall, was built soon after the earthquake that 'Overthrew so much of the MM HI Palace' (1928, 672; see also 390). Elsewhere he places the event in the MM III B period, but it is clear that he is referring to end of the Old Palace (ibid., 1930, 88). This may provide further evidence of the earthquake that marks the end of the Old Palace period, which this study places at the end of the MM II B period. The Early South- West Houses Excavation by C. E Macdonald beneath the South-West House (abbreviated P/92) has revealed two successive buildings of the Old Palace period. The earliest is a rec- tangular structure with white plaster floors. The de- posit on the floors was accompanied by substantial traces of burning. Material recovered includes a large quan- tity of pottery, horn cores cut from the skulls of bovid and ovicaprids, one nodulus, one possible basket seal- ing and one fragment of a clay tablet inscribed in the Linear A script (French 1993, 68; Weingarten 1994, 177-8). The pottery from the early floor has been as- signed to the MM II A period. The event suggested by the burnt destruction could, therefore, be linked with the burnt deposit in the nearby West Magazine 2. A more substantial structure than the first was erected over the fill of the MM II A debris, during the MM II B period. The second building was also destroyed by fire, apparently at the end of the Old Palace period in MM II B (French 1994, 68). The South Front D. Wilson and N. Momigliano in 1993 conducted exca- vations on the South Front to help elucidate the his- tory of settlement in the area prior to the construction of the palace (French 1994, 74-5). To the E of a house of the EM III period, called the 'S Front House', they found a level of paving, that sealed a large fill of the MM I B period. The paving may be associated with a ramp leading up the slope towards the South Front and so may be part of an early access to the palace. The sealed deposit, when fully studied, could help define the con- struction period of the earliest phase of the South Front. The North-West Acropolis Houses The Western Enceinte Wall enclosed a number of build- ings known as 'the private houses of the inner city' or 'the North- West Acropolis Houses', FIG. 1.7 (Evans 1935, 51 fig. 30). There is no detailed report of these buildings, cleared by Pendlebury in 1930; no notebooks kept during their excavation have come to light and the walls are shown only in schematic plan. It is clear from the visible remains that there were at least two archi- tectural phases (Hood and Taylor 1981, Plan, Early Houses). Evans assigned the earliest material from this area to the MM I B period; there was also said to be a rich de- posit of MM II pottery in one room, and later houses, contemporary with the New Palace, were constructed over the tops of some of the earlier ones on the W side and over the Western Enceinte Wall (Evans 1935, 76). Momigliano has shown that rooms 5-8 of House B are later than the MM I A period and so should also be included among the early houses of the Old Palace pe- riod (1991, 210). The rich deposit of MM II pottery was called the 'West Polychrome Deposit', FIG. 1 .7. The location given by Evans corresponds to that given by Pendlebury to a group of material from the 'Trench E. of later houses' in KSM boxes B III 8 (1935, 7 plan 4). The study of the</page><page sequence="33">RE-INVESTIGATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 33 pottery from this test shows that it joins with the pot- tery from the Koulouras and 1904 TP 11, and seems to be part of the large-scale filling operation that took place in the area of the West Court at the end of the Old Pal- ace period. All the material from these deposits has been joined to form Group E, here called the West Poly- chrome Deposits, after the name given by Evans to the deposit in the North- West Acropolis Houses. Group E. The West Polychrome Deposits Context Pendlebury's observation, that the pottery and rubble in the Central Kouloura had been tipped in from the NE corner, suggests that the structure was intention- ally filled-in (1930, 55 n. 1). Given the fact that the pottery from the three Koulouras, the area to the N of the East Kouloura, 1904 TP 11, and from the room in the North- West Acropolis Houses (B HI 8) joins and, therefore, is from the same source, its most likely inter- pretation is that the Koulouras were filled in with pot- tery and building materials re-deposited from destroyed structures nearby. A similar and contemporary re-depo- sition group in the area of the House of the Fallen Blocks, Group N, may also be interpreted as a filling operation and the nature of the destruction there sug- gests that it followed a major earthquake (see below p. 46). The North- West Acropolis Houses may also have been destroyed in the same earthquake, and the result- ing debris pushed S into the Koulouras and used for levelling operations throughout the area. Shortly after- wards, the paving of the West Court was extended over the Koulouras and some of the early houses. This Group, then, comes from the time of the cleaning up and re-modelling of the area. Re-assembly Some of the pottery from Kouloura 1 was illustrated by Evans (1935, pls. XXIX, XXX), but only very little in relation to the amount recovered and photographed. This Group was re-assembled using photographs in the Evans Archive, reproduced here in PLATES 61-7, which illustrate vases and sherds recognised among the mate- rial from the Koulouras in the KSM. Most of the pots in the archive photographs could not be located, and could not be included in the catalogue because of un- certainty over their fabric and manufacturing tech- niques. The 347 vases included here, 262-608 illustrated in PLATES 9-21 and 61-99, are for the most part frag- ments from boxes in the KSM assigned to B I 14, 19, 20 and 21 and B III 8. Some are in the HM, and were recognised in the Evans Archive photographs, and oth- ers are fragments in the AM that join vases in the HM or KSM. The material, found to be mixed with the EM III- MM I A pottery from the Houses below the Koulouras, but comprising primarily MM II B and MM HI A types, and recently published by Momigliano, should be con- sidered as part of this Group (1 991, 210, 235-6). Relative date The Fine Buff pottery is all wheelmade and in types, wares and styles that are not found in Groups A-C and the Royal Pottery Stores. There are many examples of the characteristic types of the MM II B period, as de- fined in Chapter 2, including Straight-sided Cups of Type 7 (274, 303-5, 323, 329, 433), Type 9 (280, 284, 319-21, 326, 332, 335-7), Type 10 (273, 277, 293-8, 315-17, 322, 327-8, 331, 338-9); Short-rimmed An- gular Cups of Type 3 (409-12); Rounded Cups of Type 6 (340-68); Baggy-shaped Bridge-spouted Jars (390- 1) and Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Types 5 (379- 88) and 6 (389). Many types seem to span the MM II B and MM III A periods, including Straight-sided Cups of Type 8 (275, 279, 300-2, 333 and 408), Type 1 1 (423- 6) and Type 12 (404-7); Rounded Cups of Type 5 (285- 6, 37^-6, 417-21, 436-44) and Type 7 (413-6); Rhytons of Types 1 (395-7) and 2 (398-9). The single MM III A type is Straight-sided Cup of Type 13 (403). Examples of the characteristic wares are Precision Stamped (433-4, 436-45) and Late Printed Ware (293- 8) of the MM II B period; and Precision Grooved (408, 41 1-21, 430) and Ridged Ware (401-12, 423-6) of both the MM II B and MM III A periods. Examples of the distinctive styles are in the Sunrise, (280-4, 336-7, 385-7)&gt; Starburst (274-7, 338), Wavy- line (340-68) and Spiral Band (306, 309-31, 333, 372, 379-84, 390, 400) styles of the MM II B period; and the White-spotted, (299-305, 403-7, 409-16, 419-20, 423-6, 428-9) and Heavy Spiral (311, 332, 334) styles of the MM II B and MM HI A periods. The Fine Buff pottery from the West Polychrome Deposits, then, consists for the most part of forms, tech- niques and styles of both the MM II B and MM IH A periods, with no evidence of later material. Pottery sherds and a sheep-bell of the MM I A and possibly MM I B periods, grouped with some of this material, appear in the lower half of one of the Ashmolean Ar- chive photographs, reproduced here in PLATE 67. These fragments may have been part of the fill, but may also have come from either the construction phase of the Koulouras or from the late MM I A floors in House B. Evans regarded White-spotted Style pottery as char- acteristic of the MM III A period and assigned the lat- est use of Kouloura 1 to MM III on this basis, while suggesting an earlier use in MM II to explain the pres- ence of polychrome decorated pottery which he felt should be earlier (1921, 554). The presence of great quantities of polychrome pottery in the second and third Koulouras caused him to place them earlier than the first. The present study suggests that much of the poly- chrome pottery should be regarded as MM II B in form and style, based largely on comparison with material from Phaistos. The two phases suggested for the East</page><page sequence="34">34 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS Kouloura, then, are not necessary if it is accepted that the majority of the material is of MM II B date with some MM III A pottery mixed in during the Group's deposition. Comment There seems to have been a large-scale re-organisation of the West Court at the beginning of the MM I B pe- riod. The EM III-MM I A houses beneath the Koulouras were sacrificed for the large stone-lined Koulouras. Apparently at the same time the Enceinte walls were built, again cutting through earlier build- ings. The collapsed rows of gypsum blocks from the S wall allow for the suggestion that both it and the W wall had impressive and high courses of gypsum blocks on their external facades, which had been removed or largely decayed by the time of their discovery. The walls must have been designed to control access to the Koulouras and associated buildings, and may have served as a boundary or defensive wall for the palace which came into being at this time. The area was again re-modelled on a grand scale, following what appears to have been a seismic event. The debris created by the earthquake includes a great deal of fine pottery of the MM II B period, which may have come from nearby buildings or from the clearing out of the palace itself. This second remodelling most likely coincides with the renovations that mark the be- ginning of the New Palace period in MM HI A. Sig- nificant at this time is the expansion of the West Court over the Koulouras, perhaps to enhance the monumen- tality of the newly restored West Façade, and the aban- donment of the Enceinte walls in favour of permitting the 'invasion of parts of the Palace site by private per- sons' (Evans 1928, 672). PART 4. THE WEST WING Little of the early history of the West Wing survives intact, perhaps due to a major remodelling early in the neopalatial period. The reconstructions seem to have affected even the façades, though further re-investiga- tion with new trials may be necessary before drawing any conclusions (Momigliano 1991, 169-71). North Front, West Façade and Early Keep S. Hood and J. Shaw conducted trials in 1973 to deter- mine the construction date of the North- West Platform with its singular make-up of small rectangular stones (Catling 1974, 34). Hood directed further trials by A. Peatfield in 1987 (Hood 1994, 101-2). Both campaigns revealed the same result: the North Front was built during EM III well before the main palace structure. Though a function could not be suggested, Hood ob- served that during the early palace period the North Front continued to be used and there seemed to have been an entrance from the N that went out of use in MM I B or MM II A. Evans' trials in the W wall of Magazine 12 indicated that the West Façade was built during MM I ( 1 92 1 , 1 29 n.2), although Momigliano points out that there is a problem as what he would have called MM I A others now call EM HI (1992, 170). Hood and Shaw's 1973 trials in the walls of Magazines 1 1 and 14 to 18 seem to confirm Evans' early date, but until the pottery is fully published it may be most sensible to reserve judgment on the date of the West Façade, EM III or MM I A. Either way, the North Front seems to be the earliest architectural element to have been a part of the palace, perhaps followed soon after by the monumental West Façade. To the E of the North Front, Evans discovered an early structure built of small stones, similar to those employed in the North Front, that contained six deep rectangular stone-lined cuttings he likened to dungeons (1921, 127-39; Branigan 1992). Evans assigned the con- struction date of the Early Keep to the MM I A period; but Branigan's re-investigation of the pottery from Evans' trials, to date the cuttings into neolithic and EM levels and the construction of the internal walls, shows that the latest forms are Rounded Goblets of Type 2 and therefore MM I B in date (ibid., 158 fig. 2.7-9). He ponders the late date for a 'carinated cup', that he feels should almost certainly be MM II; but this is not in conflict with his desired date as the illustration depicts a Short-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 2, a form that originates in the MM I B period (ibid., fig. 2.5). The Early Keep, then, seems to have been built early in the Old Palace period, but not as early as the North Front and West Façade. The Vat Room Deposit In 1903 Evans conducted a series of trials beneath the floors of the palace, which he felt had been erected on a flattened surface created by levelling the earlier tell. Immediately under the pavement of the entrance to the Room of the Stone Vats, he excavated a 'pit' about one metre in depth (1903, 94-8). Within the pit he reported two layers: a lower deposit of ceramic types he consid- ered to be Early Minoan and a later deposit which he considered to belong at the beginning of the MM I pe- riod. Momigliano's detailed re-investigation of the pot- tery has cast doubt on the stratigraphy within the pit, and shown that its contents belong to what is now re- garded as the earliest stages of the Old Palace period (Momigliano 1991, 167-75). The pottery includes types that are found in both the MM I A and MM I B peri- ods, such as a Shallow Bowl of Type 1 (ibid., no. 14), a Rounded Goblet of Type 1 (ibid., no. 1), a Convex-sided Cup (ibid., no. 9), and a Pedestalled Lamp of Type 1 (ibid., no. 49), but also a Conical Goblet of Type 1 in the Diagonal Red and White Style (ibid., no. 4)- a form</page><page sequence="35">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 3 5 and style of the MM I B period. The small jugs with butterfly pattern (ibid., nos. 17-24), are related in form to 164 in Group B and the small jug from the deposit below the floor in West Magazine 2, both Groups de- posited in the MM II A period. The Vat Room juglets may be the late MM I A or early MM I B predecessors of the more angular forms of late MM I B or MM II A types. The Vat Room Deposit, then, could have been formed at one time. There are pottery types that are found in both the MM I A and MM I B periods, and they allow us to conclude that the deposit was formed after the end of MM I A and during an early stage of MM I B, very early in the period of the first palace. It is tempt- ing to suggest that the material was either the result of clearing up after a late MM I A destruction, in which case the associated pottery and finds would be assign- able to the very end of the MM I A period, or a founda- tion deposit to mark the construction of this part of the West Wing early in the MM I B period. West Magazines During the first excavation season in 1900, Evans cleared the S part of the West Magazines. Beneath the floor of Magazine 2 he found an early deposit consist- ing of a large two-handled jar, the upper part of which had been cut away, filled with small pots and several clay nodules. He then reported that 'The older floor on which this vase stood apparently represents the origi- nal floor level' (Evans 1900, 21; Brown 1983, 68-9). In 1 90 1, Evans found a second early deposit beneath the West Magazines, this time 1.65 m from the W end of Magazine 1 . He reported finding 'A wide mouthed Kamáres jar, broken at the rim, containing smaller ves- sels, among them some cups of exquisitely thin fabric' (Evans 1901, 48). He drew the comparison with the deposit in Magazine 2, and later drew the parallel both for the finds, particularly the tumblers in fine red mot- tled fabric, and the circumstance with the Vat Room Deposit (192 1, 172). But, by 1921 he observed that both deposits 'Were contained in small pits excavated in the superficial neolithic stratum on which the floors of the later Magazines were laid' (ibid.), and concluded that they may have belonged to magazines of an earlier build- ing, an idea later repeated (1928, 663). Both early deposits were seen to belong to the same time as the Vat Room Deposit and thus assigned to the MM I A period. Momigliano's review of the contexts rejected Evans' date and suggested that both belonged in theOld Palace period (1991, 154-5). As the Vat Room Group now seems to have been deposited in MM I B, it may be necessary to consider the pottery in the Group beneath Magazine 1 to belong to the same period and perhaps, like the Vat Room Deposit, to have been a foun- dation deposit; though any further speculation with- out the original finds may be pointless. The Group be- neath Magazine 2, though, seems to be of a later date. The large jar is a handmade amphora decorated in a style reminiscent of the Polychrome Geometric Style of the late MM I A period (Brown 1983, fig. 36a). The contents included a Rounded Goblet of Type 2 (ibid., 36b, c), which can be both MM I B and MM II A, a small jug with angular profile like 164 (ibid.), and sev- eral Crude Goblets (ibid.), a diagnostic form of the MM II A period. This Group, then, could represent an origi- nal floor deposit in Magazine 2, as first suggested by Evans. The large amphora could have been an heirloom at the time of the destruction, which fired the clay nod- ules found inside it. The burnt deposit may relate to that found on the first floor in the nearby Early SW House, that also contained a fired nodulus. The South-West Palace Angle In 1973, S. Hood and J. Shaw opened a trial on the E side of room 17, immediately S of the West Magazines (Catling 1974, 34). They recovered a substantial pot- tery deposit that included burnt clay sealings. The re- mainder of the deposit was cleared by C. Macdonald in 1987, who found many more whole vases and three burned noduli stamped by the same seal (Catling 1988, 68; Hood 1994, 101). The pottery includes a large number of Early Palace forms and a collection of angu- lar cups and bridge-spouted jars in the Diagonal Red and White Style of the MM I B period. Thus the de- posit should be associated with the burnt destruction at the end of the MM I B period elsewhere in the palace and town. PART 5. THE NORTH-EAST INSULA OR ROYAL POTTERY STORES Excavations in 1902 were concentrated on the E slope of the Kephala hill, where Evans was surprised to find that the palace continued for a greater distance than previously thought. Mackenzie supervised the clearing of a long protuberance of land to the E of the North Entrance Passage known as the 'North-East Shoot'. Structures of the later palace period were almost en- tirely absent, for which a lime kiln was thought respon- sible (Mackenzie 1903, 117). At a depth of about 0.50 m from the surface, walls began to appear and sound- ings between them produced some of the finest pottery from the site. By the end of May the walls had become a defined architectural unit, FIG. 1.8. The area became known as the North-East Kamares Area and North- East Insula and finally, because of the high quality of the ceramics found, the Royal Pottery Stores. There are many problems associated with the re-in- vestigation of the Royal Pottery Stores. The absolute levels given by Mackenzie and Evans are from the sur- face, which almost certainly sloped eastward, making the cross reference of levels between the different rooms impossible. Also, Mackenzie recorded that he threw</page><page sequence="36">3Ó RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS away great quantities, at least 93 baskets, of pottery from this area rarely specifying from which deposit (1902 PB (2), 34, 37, 50-8). The following Groups, then, must be taken as pre-selected and treated with extreme preju- dice. I 3 Pm ^M 6 1 Fig. 1.8. Sketch plan oft he Royal Pottery Stores (after Mackenzie 1Ç02 DB (2); Mosso 1Q07, plan; Hood and Taylor ig8i, plan). Group E The South-West Room Context The first deposit encountered was in a small space be- tween two E-W walls, 0.90 m apart and closed off at the W end. The deposit was said to be Tacked with Kamares potsherds some of them of fine quality' (Mackenzie 1902 DB (2), 81). The stratigraphy within the tiny enclo- sure was reported as follows: neolithic levels were encountered at 1.50 m from the sur- face; at a depth of 1 .00 m lay the 'Kamares' deposit which continued to 0.50 m from the surface, above which was surface deposit (ibid.). Along with the numerous ceramic finds reported from the 'Kamares' deposit were four terracotta figurines apparently of bulls. The exact location of this space within the area of the Royal Pottery Stores is problematic, because no fur- ther reference was made to the deposit in the notebook, when other walls began emerging. There is a small space of similar dimensions in the rooms N of the Lime Kiln, but no finds were reported from there. At the S end of the long walls to the E of the Lime Kiln there is a small square space of 0.90 X 0.90 m, which fits Mackenzie's description, FIG. 1.8 no. 1. A Group of very fine pot- tery and four terracotta bulls in the KSM are said to come from the 4SW Room' of the North-East Kamares Area, and some of the pottery from here joins with pub- lished vases from the Royal Pottery Stores. Pendlebury locates the room as the southernmost of the four rooms on the E side of the Lime Kiln, but this does not ex- plain why it was called the South- West Room (1935, 18 L III 1). Mackenzie's description of the room and its dimensions do not allow for it to be put in one of the four rooms E of the Lime Kiln. It seems most sensible to place the deposit in the tiny enclosure to the SW of the other rooms as the name suggests. Re-assembly The Group was re-assembled by means of illustrations published by Mackenzie (1903, 176 fig. 3pls.V, VI. 1-3) and Evans (1921, figs. 178, 181, 184, pl. II) and two unpublished photographs in the Evans Archive, repro- duced here in PLATES 70 and 71. A number of pieces were inscribed to show they came from here (listed in APPENDIX HI). Most useful is Mackenzie's list of pot- tery from the 1902 excavations, which includes descrip- tions of many of the whole vases from this and other groups, and much of the sherd material as well (1902 PB (2), 65-80). The pottery assigned to this Group in the KSM was problematic until it was realized that the contents of boxes #997 and #1197 had become switched. When #1197 was strewn with #996 and #998, L III 1 in the KSM Guide, a number of useful joins were made and the Group could be re-assembled. Joins were also found with material in the HM, allowing for the inclusion of jar 667, and with the AM bringing in the unique cup 669. Joins were also made with box #1 198 which, like #1197, was meant to contain material from the Early Deposit beneath the Room of the Olive Press, Group L. The catalogue includes 62 vases (609-70) illustrated in PLATES 22-4 and 100-10. Relative date There is some handmade pottery, but the majority of the Fine Buff Ware is wheelmade. There are examples of the Diagonal Red and White (609-10, 613) and Wo- ven (61 1-2, 614) styles, which are characteristic of the</page><page sequence="37">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 37 MM I B groups at Knossos, as are Straight-sided Cups of Type 2 (61 1-2). Forms, wares and styles that seem to span both the MM I B and MM II A periods are Coni- cal Goblets of Type 1 (609-10); and Type 3 (651-2); a Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 1 (613); Rounded Cups of Type 3 (618-23, 631, 643-6) and Type 4 (616- 7, 642, 661); Barbotine Ware (613); Early Printed Ware (624-32) and pottery decorated in the White-banded Style (636, 648). Pottery of the MM II A period includes a Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar of Type 4 (665) and nu- merous examples of true Egg-shell Ware (615-23). The latest pottery, then, indicates that this Group was formed in the MM II A period. Pedestalled bowl 647 is of a type well-known at Malia, where it has been as- signed to the MM II period (Pelon and Stürmer 1989). Group G. The Area of the Lime Kiln Context Early walls were observed to continue beneath the later Lime Kiln, which was subsequently removed and the deposit beneath cleared. The result was that 'A good deal of Kamares pottery' was found (Mackenzie 1902 DB (2), 31). There is no mention of stratigraphy. Pendlebury locates the position of a group of boxes in the KSM labelled 'Lot from Area of Lime Kiln (N. E. Shoot)' in the long and narrow N-S passage directly beneath the Lime Kiln (1933, L HI 16), which con- forms with Mackenzie's description and is accepted here, as shown in FIG. 1 .8 no. 2. This Group, then, rep- resents the contents of the only floor deposit reported in the narrow corridor adjacent to the Small East Rooms. Re-assembly This Group comes from a series of boxes in the KSM labelled 'Lot from Area of Lime Kiln (N. E. Shoot)' (Pendlebury 1933: L III 16). The inventoried pottery, 671-753 illustrated in PLATES 121-27, *s aH fr°m the KSM. The context for many of these pieces is con- firmed by their description in Mackenzie's notebook (1902 PB (2), 39-44). Relative date The presence of types such as Crude Goblets (689-97) and Crude Cups of Type 2 (671-707) provide a date at the end of the MM II A period for the Group. Earlier elements that seem to have survived from the MM I B period are a Rounded Goblet of Type 2 (682); Straight- sided Cups of Type 2 (674-5); Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 2 (677-81) and examples of Pared Ware (671) and Woven Style (674-5). Group H. The Small East Rooms Context The next deposit excavated was in an area defined by a N-S wall and two E-W walls 1 .94 m apart. Mackenzie's sketch at the time of excavation shows the first room as being E of the Lime Kiln (1902 DB (2), 18). He reports that 'The space was packed full of Kamares pottery some of it of the very finest typical painted varieties' (ibid.). The stratigraphy observed in the room is as follows: • near the surface was a 'Clayey deposit with com- mon Mycenaean and some Kamares pot sherds', continuing to a depth of 1.25 m from the sur- face, • a dark stratum full of wood ashes 0.12 m thick, 'packed with common Kamares pot sherds', • a pale, 'clayey', stratum 0.20 m deep with little pottery, and • at a depth of 1 .88 m from the surface was a 'dark stratum with wood ashes 0.45 m thick and crammed with Kamares pot sherds some of it of the finest painted varieties' (ibid., 18-19). Evans repeated the description of this sequence in his report on the 1902 season, giving general hints about the relative dates of each level. He said the top level contained pottery as late as the 'Period of Re-occupa- tion', the next layer contained pottery similar to that below the Room of the Spiral Fresco. The pottery from the third level was said to have the same general char- acter as the second, and the lowest level, with a deposit resting on a clay floor, had Minoan vases 'Of the finest fabric' (1903, 118). This was repeated again in 1921 (240-1). Re-assembly There are two boxes of pottery in the KSM said to be from the 'Small rooms E. of Lime Kiln' (Pendlebury 1933, 19: LUI 15). One of the boxes contains a mixture of all periods, and may represent the finds from the upper levels. The other contains a group of pottery typi- cal of the MM II A period, including two examples, 755 and 758, that are described by Mackenzie as having come from here (1902 PB (2), 53). Mackenzie stated that 'There is no admixture of Mycenaean (LM) potsherds in the deposit proper, that is, in the stratum immedi- ately above the floor', presumably the one at 1.88 m (1902 DB (2), 20). The labelling of the boxes in the KSM suggests that it may belong to more than one floor deposit, and could represent a collection of selected pots from the lowest floors of all four rooms to the E of the Lime Kiln, FIG. 1.8 nos. 3-6. The inventoried pottery, 754-87 illustrated in PLATES 1 18-20, is from box #1071 in the KSM. Some of the pottery in Group J is quite similar and probably comes from these rooms, but cannot be included in this Group with confidence. Relative date The pottery is very similar to that from Groups G and L, although there is a marked lack of fine decorated</page><page sequence="38">38 RE-INVESTIGATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS examples. The Crude Goblets (763-5) and Crude Cups of Type 2 (766-71) place the formation of the burnt floor deposits in the MM II A period. Among the sur- vivors from MM I B, or perhaps from an earlier floor, are a Rounded Cup of Type 1 (756) and an Angular Bridge-spouted jar of Type 1 (755). Group I. The Room of the Jars Context East of the middle rooms to the E of the Lime Kiln, is another early room with a floor level at 1 . 1 5 m below the surface. On the floor were twelve large jars lying in rows on their sides with their tops to the S, after which the area became known as the Room of the Jars. Mac- kenzie likened the shape of the jars to an example with an inscription on its shoulder from the South- West Basement, but wrote that 'There is no doubt that the deposit belongs to the Kamares period like that adja- cent W. Some fine Kamares fragments were found in the same deposit' (1902 DB (2), 19). Cleaning of the walls, late in the 1902 season, revealed that there were doors leading from the Room of the Jars into the two middle rooms to the E (ibid., 45). Pendlebury (1933: L HI 8) located the Room of the Jars in a space that cor- responds to Mackenzie's description as being to the E of the Small East Rooms, shown here in FIG. 1.8 no. 7. Evans, perhaps influenced by Mackenzie's suggested parallels for the jars, associated them with the upper level in the Small East Rooms and stated that they were found 'Separated by layers of clay and burnt materials' from the MM II A material below (1921, 571). He sug- gested a MM HI date for the jars and classified them with the 'rustic' ware of MM HI, which included the elongated jars from the North-East Magazines. He also compared the shape with that of the inscribed jar from the South- West Basement (ibid., 572 fig. 416). Re-assembly The pottery from the Room of the Jars presented here represents only a very small selection of whole vases, included to allow for the date of the deposit to be dis- cussed. Much more material from this area is stored in the KSM and will be published by Momigliano in due course. For the present study the jars published by Evans (1 921, fig. 416), and three cups from the KSM are inventoried, 788-94, and illustrated in PLATES 121- 23 including two photographs from the Evans Archive. Relative date The cups are Straight-sided Cups of Type 2 (789 and 790) and a Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type ib (788) which are types of the MM I B period. The large jars are quite different from the example cited from the South- West Basement and are decorated in the White- banded Style, which is characteristic of both the MM I B and MM II A periods. It seems most likely that this Group belongs to the MM I B period and may be earlier than the other groups in the Royal Pottery Stores, and not MM IH B as re- ported by Warren and Hankey (1989, 62). Group J. The Royal Pottery Stores in General This Group is composed of vases, primarily in the HM, that are known to come from the Royal Pottery Stores but cannot be assigned to one of the specific locations described above. It also includes vases published by Mackenzie (1903, 180 fig. 6; PLATE 124), some of which could no longer be found. Most of these examples probably belong either to Group G or H, as they are very similar to pottery in those Groups. 808, however, is much finer than pieces in those Groups and may have come from Group F. It was published by Pendlebury (1939, pl. XVII. 2a) as having come from the West Court Basement, our Group A, but is inscribed with 'K.02 NEKA', which places it in the Royal Pottery Stores. Comment Mackenzie's first impression (1906, 256) was that the destruction deposits in the Royal Pottery Stores were contemporary with those below the later North- West Treasury (Groups B-C), the Early Chamber beneath the West Court (Group A), and the early floor beneath the Room of the Olive Press (Group L), and all be- longed in the MM II period. It is suggested above, p. 26, that Group A was formed toward the end of the MM I B period. Evans maintained that the pottery from the Royal Pottery Stores was characteristic of the MM II A pe- riod (1921, 231-47), and these Groups, F in particular, have become the standard reference for the ceramics of the period (e.g. Pendlebury 1939, 133; Warren and Hankey 1989, 52). The only opposing voices seem to be those of Betancourt, who assigns them to MM II B (1985a, 95), and Walberg, who regards them as part of her Classical Kamares phase which corresponds to Evans' MM II A-II B-IH A (1976, 120-1). This study recommends that the latest pottery from the Royal Pottery Stores should be retained as the stand- ard reference group for the end of the MM II A period. It is primarily through comparisons with these Groups and the pottery of Fiandra's Period 2 at Phaistos that the definition for the MM II A period, outlined in Chap- ter 2, is suggested. Group I, deposited in MM I B, is earlier than Groups F-H, but may be contemporary with early floors be- neath those of the MM II A period. The existence of early floors could account for the intact MM I B pot- tery in the otherwise MM II A groups. Two burnt lev- els are reported in the Small East Rooms, Group H. The finds have not been kept separate, but it might be proposed that the pottery defined stylistically as MM</page><page sequence="39">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 39 I B came from the floor at 1 .88 m and that the MM II A floor was at 1.37 m. Mackenzie (1906, 252-3) mentioned that further excavations, carried out in 1905 below the floors in this area, produced vases and sherds, which he likened to those from the Upper East Well, assigned to the EM III period (Cadogan et al. 1993, 25), but also to the ear- liest floor in the Monolithic Pillar Basement and the deposit from House C, which are taken here as belong- ing in the MM I A period (Chapter 2). Comparison was also made to the Group from the North Quarter of the City, which Momigliano has shown to contain a great deal of EM III pottery, but also MM I A and MM I B fragments (1991, 176-84). Until the material is identi- fied and studied, we are not in a position to be more precise than EM III, MM I A or even MM I B. The MM II A groups from the Royal Pottery Stores belong to destruction deposits, created during an event that left its mark elsewhere in the palace. The burnt layer in the Small East Rooms conforms with evidence from other deposits, and helps characterize the nature of this widespread destruction at Knossos, which is used to mark the end of MM II A period. It is quite likely that the area was re-occupied, if only on a limited scale, after MM II A. Evidence for this may be provided by the upper floor with wood ash in the area of the Small East Rooms. The material from this floor could not be positively identified, but Evans com- pared it to the pottery from the Loomweight Basement, which is of MM II B- III A date. The ravages of the later Lime Kiln may have removed any other evidence for the late Old Palace period here. PART 6. THE EAST CENTRAL ENCLAVE Excavations on the E side of the palace in 190 1 uncov- ered a network of rooms, which included the Corridor of the Bays and associated storerooms, the School Room and the Room of the Olive Press (Evans 1901, 82-90 pl. I). Further investigations in 1902 revealed the ex- istence of basement rooms with earth floors, lying al- most 2.00 m below the ground floor levels. The base- ments were found filled with debris. In some cases the walls continued below the floor levels of the late palace basements to depths of over 4.00 m below the surface. Earlier floor levels with 'Kamares' pottery were found, and so the foundations for the system of walls was as- signed to the Old Palace period and the area became known as the East Central Enclave, FIG. 1.9. The Area of the Spiral Fresco Group K. The Loomweight Basement Context Excavations in 1902, beneath the basements in the Area of the Spiral Fresco and the room to the S, revealed a depth of stratigraphie levels, described by Mackenzie in detail in his excavation notebook for that year. In the area S of the Area of the Spiral Fresco, at a depth of about 4.00 m from the surface, a tumble of rough blocks was encountered. Beneath the tumble was a level of thickly packed 'Kamares' pottery and fresco fragments. Associated with the tumble in the NW corner was a de- posit of loom weights, after which this area was named. Below the level of stone and loomweights, at roughly the same depth, were the fragments of two large spouted jars, reported to be at the top of a deposit of Kamares pottery. At the same depth there was a plaster platform and the remains of what was interpreted as a plaster chest in the SE corner (Mackenzie 1902 DB (1), 75). The plaster platform, or 'dais', continued under the wall to the N, into the space under the Area of the Spi- ral Fresco. Mackenzie recorded quantities of the 'Finer Kamares pottery' from the deposit (ibid., 75). The plas- ter platform, which was 0.19 m thick, was resting on a stratum of pottery sherds above a floor of rough plaster at a depth of 4.50 m below the surface. 'Accordingly', wrote Mackenzie, 'the platform cannot belong to the system of the floor but must be a later construction' (ibid., 77). A test beneath the platform, going down to the level of the floor at 4.50 m below the surface, showed that the earlier level 'Contained large quantities of Kamares pottery some of it of very fine quality' (ibid. 1902 DB (2), 53). In the next room to the N, the Area of the Spiral Fresco, the 'Kamares' deposit was also found at a depth of 4.50 m from the surface (1902 DB (2), 1-2). There was also a floor level, constructed of rough cement, found at a depth of 4.80-4.90 m from the surface. The lower floor was reported to have 'Above it a stratum in which Kamares pottery exclusively occurred' (Macken- zie 1902 DB (2), 1 1). In the NE corner, there were large fragments of wall plaster at depths of 3.40 to 3.60 m from the surface, in a deposit 0.50 m deep. The Kamares floor level was 0.60 m below the plaster level (ibid.). In association with the plaster was a raised platform, like that found in the room to the S (ibid., 14). Evans' first report on the Loomweight Basement did not mention the two distinct levels, observed by Mac- kenzie, but described the finds as having come from a single deposit (1903, 23-7). He stated that hard cement floors occurred throughout the area, at a common depth of about 5.00 m below the datum, which was a triangu- lar block in the wall between the E and W sections of the structure (1921, 249). There are problems with the ab- solute levels in this area because some are given as from the surface, others as from the LM I floor level and others as from the datum. The datum and surface are probably quite close. The LM I floor level seems to be an average of 0.50 to 0.70 m below the surface. This discrepancy might help to explain the difference of 0.50 to 1. 00 m in the floor levels reported by Mackenzie in the Area of the Spiral Fresco and in the room to the S. Evans seems to have understood the problem and ig-</page><page sequence="40">40 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS -SURFACE ''''xv''íxNN EO LITHIC''^STRATUM'''^'O''X SCALE OF I....I....I I I | | | I I I | | METRES H5^B^Ä^^^^;^^^B ' PLASTER 'FLOOR BELOW " ^^^| HHsHSa ■^BBii|Mi^f|#^^H ' WITH MMIIb SHERDS " ^^H IHsubstruc^ureJ uj wO^^Êíf/^//^/y^yyy//^^^K^^ &lt;•...,.*•.-,•. •• wall* plaster • ¿;^^^H » ^^^^^^H ° ^Ht^B^^^^^^^^^^^H ' I :■•■••■/' -1 GOLD IPAItNCC ^^^B' ^^^^^^H ' ^ ^SS^k^^^V/W^^^^^m^^^^ ^Z) MINIATUR^ OVERTOP V ^^^H ^^^^^^H O ° ^^K^B^W^/^^^^^^^^Êm^ JArI' /^rVC0HNROMt t of • ^^^H FRAGMENTS OF ^^^^^^H u_ ^ES^B^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B^"10'1 BASEMEN^Sr ^^ TERRA -COTTA SHRINE^ ^^^^B SHR|NE ^^^^^^^H CONTINUATION TO.

Evans' cement floor, at about 5.00 m below datum, seems to correspond to Mackenzie's level at 4.00 m. The deposit includes the plaster platform or dais and everything above it, including the large amphora with palm tree decoration (Evans 1921, 253 fig. 190) and large spouted jars, FIG. 1.9. Evans also included the fragments underlying the dais in the 0.20 m of fill, that made up the platform (ibid., 251). Mackenzie's rough plaster floor, at 4.50 m, was given by Evans at a depth of 5.30 m below datum, and was assigned to the MM I A period (1921, 251 n. 1), instead of the 'Kamares' period, as Mackenzie had stated. The reason for the change may be due to the findings of supplementary excavations undertaken in 1920. Unfortunately, the material from the 1920 test cannot be checked; the box in the KSM, said to come from this test, contains material which clearly belongs to the Royal Pottery Stores (Pendlebury 1933, 20: M III 2a). There is no material of the MM I A period in any of the boxes at- tributed to the Loomweight Basement (Momigliano 1991,204). Re-assembly This Group is composed of pottery illustrated as hav- ing come from the Loomweight Basement (Mackenzie 1903, 177 fig. 4, 178 fig. 5; Evans 1921, figs. 190, 191, 192a), now in the HM, AM and KSM. Mackenzie's notes on the kept pottery (1902 PB (2), 9, 12, 28, 79) confirm the attributions in published sources, and ex- amples may be recognized from his descriptions of pot- tery in the boxes assigned to the 'Loom-weight Area S. of Area of Spiral Fresco' (M III 2 #1 1 89-1 194) in the KSM. Mackenzie also records that 22 baskets of sherds from this area were thrown out (1902 PB (1), 53). The inventoried pottery, 814-91, is illustrated in PLATES 25- 6 and 126-32. Relative date Unfortunately, the finds from the two levels do not seem to have been kept apart. However, it is possible to sug- gest that the large jars in Tempered Buff Fabric (876- 8) and the amphora with palm tree decoration (891) come from the level above the cement floor, as shown by Evans (1921, 251 fig. 187b and FIG. 1.9) and stated by Mackenzie for 878 at the time of excavation (1902 PB (2) 11). A date in MM II B may be suggested by comparisons with pottery from Group E. 877 is so simi- lar in fabric, type and decoration to 585 that the two should be considered products of the same workshop. The decoration on 876-8 is closely related to the Spi- ral Band Style of Fine Buff Fabric and so Evans' date in the MM II B period should be maintained. Amphora 891 does not have close parallels elsewhere, but has generally been regarded as a late element in the deposit; Hood assigns it to the MM HI A period (1978, 36) while Warren and Hankey draw parallels with Phaistos phase HI (1989, 52). It does not fit the central Cretan fabric groups and its shape is unique, which suggest that it was imported from elsewhere on the is- land. Given its association with 876-8, it seems most likely to belong to the end of the MM II B period. Mixed with the pottery in this late MM II B level, were fragments of painted plaster dadoes, one of which could provide a link between wall painting, the ceramic Spiral Band Style (Evans 1 921, 251 fig. 188), a small juglet of gold and faience (ibid., 252 fig. 189a; Foster 1979, 60-1 fig. 1 pl. I), and a shallow bowl with gold branches set on carbonized remains (Evans 1921, 252 fig. 189b), all of which Mackenzie mentioned at the time of excavation (1902 DB (1), 66-70; (2), 7, 49). Also from this level of fill, and found in all of the basement cham- bers including that below the Enamel Deposit, were fragments of a terracotta shrine with pillars, horns of consecration and birds, which Mackenzie felt belonged to a single shrine model (1902 DB (1), 85; (2) 1-2, 7- 11, 14, 44, 49; Evans 1921, 251-2 figs. 188-9, 306 fig. 225; Schoep 1994). The loom weights, which numbered over 400, seem to have been found throughout the fill from the very top, overlying the first appearance of 'Kamares' pottery, down to just above the plaster plat- form (1902 DB (1), 75; DB (2), 53). Most of the pottery in this Group may, on typologi- cal and stylistic grounds, be assigned tentatively to the level of fill above the cement floor: for example the Crude Cups of Type 3 (826-33) and Type 4 (834-9), the Hand Lamp of Type 2 (887) and Pedestalled Lamp of Type 2 (888) and the examples decorated in the White-spotted Style (818, 873), which are characteris- tic of the MM II B period. It could be suggested that examples of earlier types could have come from the level below the cement floor, or the make-up of the plaster dais: for example the Tum- bler of Type 3 (817), the jug with horizontal spout of Type 1 (825), cups (824 and 818), bridge-spouted jar (874) and the fragments of large jars (871-2) which are very similar to fragments 738-9 in Group G. These examples would suggest that the earlier rough plaster floor belongs within the MM II A period. The material from the upper level became the stand- ard reference for pottery of the MM II B period, which was equated with the destruction of the Old Palace (Evans 1921, 248-60; Pendlebury 1939, 137-8, fig. 23). This has been questioned in detail by Warren and Hankey, who conclude that it belongs within the MM III period (1989, 52-3). The conflict in dates may be averted, if we consider that the fill in the Loomweight Basement may have been deposited early in the MM IH A period, though few of the forms classed as such have been identified from here; instead the Group seems to comprise primarily MM II B material from the de- struction of the area at the end of the Old Palace period. The nature of the upper deposits (which include both vases said to have been found in situ on the cement floor</page><page sequence="42">42 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS and pottery from the deep fill above the floor and be- low the early neopalatial floor with the Spiral Fresco), is quite similar to the West and South Polychrome de- posits, which contain for the most part rubbish and building debris used as filling and levelling material fol- lowing the earthquake, that marks the end of the Old Palace period. The Enamel Deposit The small area N of the Area of the Spiral Fresco was excavated as part of the 1902 campaign and the stratigraphy was found to be similar to that above the Loomweight Basement. Mackenzie recorded a floor at a depth of 4.40 m from the level of the late palace floor (1902 DB (2), 51). This 'cement' floor corresponds to that at a similar level in the adjacent Loomweight Base- ment. The reconstructed section shows a hypothetical continuation of the earlier plaster floor, found in the Loomweight Basement, FIG. 1.9. However, there is no mention of this earlier level in the sources. Evans reported that the Town Mosaic and other frag- ments of faience enamelled plaques, from which the area takes its name, were found in a level of fill from a depth of 0.60 m to 2.10 m below the later floor. The fill was assigned to the MM HI A period, and thus regarded as later than the 'MM II B' fill below and in the Loomweight Basement (Evans 1921, 301-2). Further fragments of the terracotta shrine were found at a fairly low level, in the area of the Enamel Deposit (Macken- zie 1902 DB (2), 44). Evans placed the shrine fragments at the same level as they occurred in the Loomweight Basement, that is the level of the plaster dais 0.60 m above the cement floor. The joins of the fragments of terracotta shrines, found in the lower fill of the Enamel Deposit, with those from above the cement floor in the Loomweight Basement, confirm that both fills are con- temporary. Given the evidence from Group K, they most likely belong to a building operation after the end of the MM II B period. The upper fill, however, is not related, and could belong to a later stage of the early neopalatial period. It has a terminus post quern provided by the floor in the 'Room of Tripod Vases', which Evans assigned to the MM HI B period, but Popham has shown belongs to an early stage of LM I A (1977, 192-3; War- ren 1991a, 334). Evans certainly regarded the upper fill as later than the lower, and we may now state that it post-dates the end of the Old Palace period in MM II B and even the major reconstruction works in MM III A. It could be taken either as contemporary with the de- posits, in which the spiral and bull frescoes were found at the same absolute level in the adjacent rooms to the W, or as part of a filling operation associated with the laying of the floor in the Magazines of the Tripods. In either case, it belongs to the neopalatial period, where the iconography of the Town Mosaic is far better suited than in the Old Palace period. Group L. The Early Floor beneath the Room of the Olive Press Context In 1902, Mackenzie conducted a small sounding be- neath the late palace floor in the NE corner of the Room of the Olive Press. A detailed re-evaluation of the exca- vation by Panagiotaki (19930) outlines inconsistencies in depth and description of the various trials made in this area. I have found it most useful to accept Macken- zie's observations, as they seem to fit best the physical evidence of the pottery itself. At a depth of c. 3.30 m below the later floor level, there was an earlier floor ap- proached by two sloping plaster steps. Wall plaster as- sociated with the early floor was found in position on one wall, preserved to a height of 1 .00 m above the floor (Mackenzie 1902 DB (2), 33). More of the early floor was cleared in 1903, and Evans reported that abundant 'Kamares' pottery and a number of clay sealings were found immediately above the floor level (1903, 19-22; 1921,239-40). Mackenzie referred to the early floor as a 'Landmark in the Minoan Epoch', because he felt it would allow for the differentiation between the pottery found above and below it (1903, 169). He studied the material in detail and recorded it in one of his pottery notebooks for the year (1902 PB (2), 17-28). His notes are sum- marized in his report on the pottery of Knossos (1903, 168-9). The report refers to levels as 'metres' and two sets of levels are described. Below the 'Kamares' floor are four 'metres' which comprise chiefly neolithic material; but in the fourth metre, that immediately underneath the 'Kamares' floor, he mentions the occurrence of wheelmade 'Kamares cups', a likely reference to our Rounded Goblet of Type 2 or Momigliano's Footed Goblet of Type 4, which is found in her EM III groups and in House 0(1991, 247-8 fig. 30). He also mentions the presence of 'painted geometric' sherds in this level 'Immediately underlying the Minoan floor' (1902 PB (2), 24; 1903, 169). He compares the pottery with that from the first floor in the Monolithic Pillar Basement, and cites a parallel with a fragment, published by Hogarth and Welch (1 901, 97 fig. 31), which leaves no doubt that he is referring to our 'Polychrome Geomet- ric' style of the late MM I A period (see pp. 93-4). The 'Kamares' floor, then, was most likely stratified above a level containing MM I A or early MM I B pottery. The second set of levels, as described in the note- book, seems to count in the opposite direction, with the first 'metre' lying directly underneath the neopalatial floor in the Room of the Olive Press. The numbering used in the notes is inverted for the publi- cation of the trial, so the lot, listed as the first 'metre' below the 'Mycenaean' floor in the pottery notebooks, is described as the third 'metre' in the publication (1903, 179)-</page><page sequence="43">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 43 The pottery from the 1903 excavations, below the Room of the Olive Press, is preserved in the KSM (Pendlebury 1933: M II 5). Four 'metres' of deposit are listed and numbered as they were excavated. Thus, the fourth 'metre' is the lowest and should correspond to the earliest use of the 'Kamares' floor at a depth of c. 3.30 m. Re-investigation of the kept sherds shows that the material from the fourth and third 'metres' joins so thoroughly, that they must be taken as part of the same deposit. Mackenzie had also observed this and suggested that the two related levels could represent a lower floor deposit mixed with material fallen from an upper floor (1903, 179). It could also be suggested that some of the material may have fallen from shelves along the walls of this basement room, on which the plaster was found preserved to a height of one metre. The deposit contains a number of almost complete vases, that could be restored, and, when combined with the examples published by Evans, form quite a useful and diagnostic Group. Re-assembly The Group consists of four vases illustrated by Evans, 925-7 and 930, and the pottery from boxes #1171 to #1 182, in the KSM, assigned to the Olive Press Area, box #997 incorrectly assigned to the Royal Pottery Stores, and #1195-6 incorrectly assigned to the Loom weight Basement. Once the errors had been sorted out, it was possible to join together one of the finest groups of pottery of its period from the palace; 892- 974 in the Catalogue, illustrated in PLATES 27-9 and 132-40. A jug in Liverpool is so similar to 928, that it could well have come from here (Mee and Doole 1993, cat. no. 283). Relative date Evans described 926 and 927 as coming from a 'MM Ha deposit 3.20 metres down' (1921, 239-40 n.i; 1935, 134), but referred 930 to 'the earlier part of MM lib' (1921,270). Pottery of the MM I B period includes Rounded Goblets of Type 1 (892-7) and Type 2 (918-9); a Straight-sided Cup of Type 1 (900); Rounded Cups of Type 1 a (902); Angular Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 1 (9°3~5) and examples in Pared Ware (892-7) and the Diagonal Red and White Style (899, 905). Forms, wares and styles that may be both MM I B and MM II A are a Rounded Goblet Type 3 (925); a Conical Goblet of Type 1 (899); a Tumbler of Type 1 (898); Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 2 (909- 17); Rounded Cups of Type 3 (921) and Type 4 (922); Shallow Angular Bowls of Type 2 (926-^7); a Hand Lamp of Type 1 (971) and examples of Barbotine Ware (926- 7) and pottery decorated in the White-banded Style (923-4). The latest pottery in the deposit are the Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 4 (930-58) and the Crude Bowls of Types 2 (959-60) and 3 (961-3), which place the formation of the Group in the MM II A period. Though the decoration on jars 957-8 is difficult to re- store completely, the characteristic pattern of an undu- lating white band with one straight and one 'bumpy' edge with added thin red or orange lines on top is very close to that on a group of sherds from a closed form, most likely a bridge-spouted jar, from the channel be- neath Vano LX at Phaistos (Fiandra 1980, 186-7 pi- 45.1, 10, 13). Also quite similar is the design on a frag- ment of a bridge-spouted jar from Haraga in Egypt (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 299-301 Ha. 16). The Phaistos jar is from a deposit of Fiandra's period 2, which conforms with the MM II A date suggested here for 957-8. There are no examples of material in styles of the MM II B or MM HI A periods. The deposit included a number of sealings, includ- ing some with characters belonging to the Pictorial Script (Evans 1903, 20). A few attributions were made on the basis of similarities in colour, shape and condi- tion (Gill 1965, 84-5). Evans assigned one of the sealings to MM I A because of its 'MM I associations' (1921, 201-2, fig. 151). This early date is not questioned by Yule, in his study of early Cretan seals, despite the close similarities between the sealing with the wild goat from here, and examples from the Hieroglyphic Deposit and the deposits of clay sealings at Phaistos, which he places at the end of MM II (Yule 1980, 122-3). Panagiotaki has convincingly re-assembled the sealings and repeats their association with the 'Thorne-vases' - our 926-7 0993*» 34-5)- When taken as part of the context of Group L, there can be little doubt that the sealings be- long with the pottery, that is, at the end of the MM II A period and closely contemporary with the much larger groups of sealings from the burnt deposits that mark the end of Period 2 at Phaistos (see below, p. 101). The sealings are evidence that the deposit was formed dur- ing a destruction by fire. The room was subsequently filled-in with debris belonging to the MM II B and MM HI A periods. The first and second 'metres' of deposit from the 1903 ex- cavations consist of numerous fragments of plain MM II B and MM HI A pottery, primarily of large jars very similar to those from the South Polychrome Deposits, including similar types of imported jars (MacGillivray 19840, 156 n. 20). Although no material is illustrated, the descriptions of the pottery include references to 'Wheelmade cups resembling the round Mycenaean type but large &amp; more saucer-like' - a likely reference to the bowls with everted rim of the MM III period (Catling et al. 1979, 27 fig. 21 V.61-3), and fragments decorated with 'large spirals in opaque cream-white on purple black lusterless varnish' - surely a reference to one of the most characteristic styles of the MM III B or</page><page sequence="44">44 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS early LM I A periods (e.g. Warren 1991a, 322 fig. 6b pl. 76c, 330 fig. 8a-b pl. 78f-g). This level, then, seems to include material of the MM HI B and LM I A periods, but perhaps also MM II B and MM III A. Mackenzie grouped the level with his deposits of the 'Closing pe- riod of the Middle Minoan Age' (1906, 264-5), which includes the North-East Magazines, Temple Reposi- tories and other groups assigned by Warren to his MM III B/LM I A transitional period (19910, 333-4). The sequence beneath the Room of the Olive Press is similar to that in the adjacent Loomweight Basement, except that the early floor is about 1 .00 m higher in the former and there is no mention of a corresponding floor level in the MM II B period. The early floor here seems to have belonged to the basement of the W room in a building which continued eastward under the North- East Portico. The School Room Area The School Room and adjoining rooms were first cleared in 1900 (Evans 1901, 96-7). Soundings through- out the area in 19 13 produced evidence, that many of the walls were founded during the Old Palace period, FIG. 1. 10. There was also evidence for at least two ear- lier floor levels beneath that of the later palace. Court of the Stone Spout A trial at the base of the S wall of the Court of the Stone Spout showed that the wall was built on top of an older wall, which Evans assigned to MM III A. The older wall was built over the top of the base of a pithos stand- ing on a plaster floor, which Evans put in MM II (1921 , 362 figs. 262, 266). Room of the Stone Pier A trial along the E face of the wall at the back of the Room of the Stone Pier in 1913 produced a clear stratigraphie sequence. Evans described the levels from the top as follows: the first was patchwork gypsum pav- ing, the second was a 'MM HI ET deposit with shallow cups, the third was a floor of white beaten earth 0.70 m below the first, the fourth was a 'MM HI A' deposit with taller cups than the second and fragments of dark- faced vases with white spots and broad plain pans, the fifth was a level of kalderim floor paving at a depth of 1. 17 m below the first level (1921, 366 n. 2). The material from this trial could not be located, but the published illustrations provide some useful informa- tion. The only pottery illustrated from the second level, that is the deposit above the floor at 0.70 m, are two plain cups which Evans likened to the conical cups of the LM I period (ibid., 588-9 fig. 432 bb). The pub- lished drawings do not allow for more specific com- ment on their chronology, although it should be noted that they bear a close resemblance in profile to our Crude Goblet which is a type-fossil of the MM II A period.

Evident in the pho- tograph are a Conical Goblet of Type 1 decorated in the Diagonal Red and White Style of the MM I B pe- riod, but also found in MM II A groups, and Pyxides of Types 3 and 4 which belong in the MM II A period; an open Spouted Goblet similar to 786-7 in Group H; and Crude Bowls of Types 2 and 3 which occur in both the MM II A and MM II B- III A groups. The deposit on the kalderim paving, then, should be assigned to the MM II A period. The East Corridor In the East Corridor, which was blocked off and used for storage in the New Palace period, Evans reported a MM II floor at depth roughly corresponding to that in the Loom weight Basement on the other side of the wall to the W (192 1, 369 n. 2). The level was also said to cor- respond with those of the early floor on the S side of the Court of the Stone Spout, which Evans called MM II, and the kalderim paving from the E borders of the School Room Area, which he assigned to MM III A but, as we have seen above, should be regarded as belonging to the MM II A period. A small 'MM IF pithos with a triple line of handles and rope work decoration is the only vase reported from the early floor. Unfortunately, the vase was not illus- trated and has not been found. Comment The earliest floors in the Loomweight Basement, Olive Press Area, Room of the Stone Pier and, most likely, the Court of the Stone Spout belong to the MM II A period. The presence of sherds of the late MM I A or early MM I B periods mixed with neolithic pottery, be- low the first floor in the Olive Press Area, suggests that the early floors and associated walls were constructed during the MM I B period or early in MM II A. The presence of accidentally fired sealings in the Early Ol- ive Press deposit indicate a destruction by fire during the MM II A period, perhaps related to that in the Royal Pottery Stores. The MM II A deposits were levelled and covered over with a 'cement' floor, found in the Loomweight Base- ment and Area of the Enamel Deposit. Above the 'ce- ment' layers were floor deposits and deep levels of fill- ing material with pottery of the MM II B and MM HI A periods. This upper destruction and filling operation may be linked to the similar filling operations in the West Court (Group E) and houses near the SE angle of the palace (Group N), which mark the beginning of the New Palace period. PART 7. THE SOUTH-EAST KAMARES AREA On the SE slope of the upper plateau, on which the pal- ace was constructed, Evans noticed an area of walls of the late palace period with earlier material between them. This area became known as the South-East Kamares Area, the location is given in FIG. 1.1 'Base- ment of Monolithic Pillars'. Group M. The Monolithic Pillar Basement Context In 1900 Evans carried out a test between two early walls in the South-East Kamares Area. He found that the depth of deposit was 4.20 m and that, from a depth of about 3.00 m downwards, there was an accumulation of early painted pottery including a vase in the form of a dove, after which the sounding became known as the 'Dove Pit' (1900, 7). Further excavations in the area took place in 1902, when two cups with Linear A in- scriptions on the interiors were found. The early build- ing into which the Dove Pit had been sunk was found to consist of deep chambers and cell-like compartments. Again, at a depth of about 3.00 m large quantities of painted pottery of the MM period were found, and a variety of clay sealings, some with pictographic script (1902, 106-7 figs. 63-6, 70). In 1903 the building was cleared and the following stratigraphie sequence observed: the tops of the walls started to appear at about 0.50 m below the surface; at 1 .30 m below the tops of the walls was a floor level with a 'streaked' pithos and pottery of the 'Palace Style'; the two cups with painted Linear A inscriptions were said to correspond to this level (Evans 1921 , 587-8, fig. 43 1 ). Below, there was a second architectural phase, 0.65 m in depth, then a basement chamber with walls preserved to a height of 2.10 m in places. 'Kamares' pottery was found associated with a floor level in the lower cham- ber, but there was also an earlier deposit of polychrome decorated pottery which could be seen to pre-date the fine 'egg-shell' ware (1903, 17-18). Mackenzie described and illustrated the 'Kamares' pottery, which he assigned to MM II, and stated that it was associated with floors (1903, pls. 6.4, 7; 1906, 244, 246). He also described in detail and illustrated the ear- lier polychrome decorated pottery, which he reported lay in an early floor deposit beneath those of MM II (1906, 244, 246, 252 pls. 7, 9). Momigliano's re-investi- gation of the pottery from the earliest floor has led her to doubt the existence of the superimposed floors, and suggest instead that Evans invented the stratigraphy, to support his notions of stylistic development, and that the two groups presented by Mackenzie belong to one period (1991, 163-6). The present study finds no reason to reject Evans' and Mackenzie's statements. While it is true that we are no longer in a position to re-examine the material as closed groups, most of the pottery from the earliest</page><page sequence="46">4Ó RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS floor does not find close parallels with that of the Old Palace period, as stated by Momigliano. Rather, the best correspondence comes from the upper floor in House B, below the West Court. In both cases, the existence of whole vases confirms Mackenzie's and Pendlebury's statements that these were floor deposits, which, be- cause of the quantities of pottery in the 'Polychrome Geometric Style' in both, may be placed late in the MM I A period. The pottery illustrated from the second, or 'Kamares', floor is later in style than that from the ear- liest floor and corresponds with the earliest stages of the Old Palace period, the MM I B period (Mackenzie 1903, pl. VII). That there was a floor deposit of this period is confirmed by a number of fine, almost com- plete vases. On the basis of Evans' statement in 1902, it seems most likely that the sealings should be associated with this floor. This would indicate a destruction by fire. The next floor in the stratigraphie sequence is that at 1 .30 m below the tops of the walls, which belongs to a new architectural phase and contained, along with the two inscribed cups, pottery which Mackenzie placed at the end of the MM period (1906, 266), perhaps now to be assigned to the MM HI B or early LM I A periods. There are many fragments of MM II B and MM III A pottery from the area, which may come from a filling operation below the latest architectural phase, but such a fill is not recorded by the excavators. Re-assembly It was decided to include here only those pieces, inven- toried or described by Mackenzie in his pottery note- books for 1902 and 1904, and those, which appear with them in a photograph in the Evans Archive, reproduced here in PLATE 142. A great deal more sherd material exists in the KSM (O II 3, 4, 7, 8) and in the HM, AM and BM (Momigliano 1991, 164-5), but, as the boxes at Knossos are thoroughly mixed and the examples in other museums are without more specific provenance, further examples would be unlikely to assist with the chronological aims of this study. The inventoried pot- tery is 975-84 in APPENDIX I, illustrated in PLATES 29, H2-3- Relative date The pottery selected to make up this Group include a Squat Rounded Cup of Type 1 (975); a Rounded Gob- let of Type 3 (976) and a Rounded Cup of Type 4 (978); and examples of Early Printed Ware (976) and 'Prickly' Barbotine Ware (977) which are found in groups of the MM I B and MM II A periods. The fragments illus- trated by Mackenzie include examples decorated in the Woven Style of the MM I B period (1903 pl. VII. 1, 7). Although the evidence is not firm, it seems most likely that the 'Kamares floor' belongs in MM I B. The Cypriot Red Polished HI amphora from the Monolithic Pillar Basement (Catling and MacGillivray 1983) cannot be placed with confidence on any of the specific floors within the structure and could equally have been found on the first, late MM I A, or the sec- ond, MM I B. Given Evans' statement that the sealings were found at a depth of about 3.00 metres with large quantities of painted MM pottery, it seems most sensible to associ- ate them with the MM I B material, rather than with the late MM I A material, found below the 3.00 metre horizon. This would provide a relative date for the noduli and seals with Hieroglyphic signs, and a chrono- logical association with the noduli from the S. W. Pal- ace Angle and impressions from the Vat Room deposit (Weingarten 1994, 178-9). Group N. The South Polychrome Deposits Extensive excavations were undertaken in 1922 to the S and E of the SE angle of the palace where a large depres- sion in the earth had been observed. Two small houses separated by a corridor with a drain were uncovered, FIG. 1 . 1 1 . The house on the E side of the corridor had a deposit of large cut blocks in the centre and was given the name 'House of the Fallen Blocks'. The house on the W side contained among other things two skulls with horns and was called the 'House of the Sacrificed Oxen' (Evans 1928, 296-303). At the time of excavation the area was called the South Kamares Area. Context Two architectural periods were noted in the House of the Sacrificed Oxen. The first is represented by three bonded walls, associated with a 'clay plaster' floor be- neath Room 1. Associated with the early walls was a group of pottery, from which Mackenzie described (1922 DB (1), 46, 79-80) and Evans illustrated (1928, 215 pl. IX d-f) a large spouted pithos, a flask and a bridge-spouted jar, our ion, 1003 and 1000. Macken- zie stated that 'Taken together they form one of the most important polychrome groups at Knossos' (1922 DB (1), 80), which he assigned to 'the close of MM II or the very beginning of MM HI A' (ibid., 79). This group from Room 1 was regarded as earlier than the main body of material and second architectural phase in the area. Evans published it as the 'South-East Poly- chrome Deposit' and placed it in the MM II A period on the basis of stylistic parallels with the Royal Pottery Stores (1928, 300). The present study agrees with Evans' date. In Room 5 of the same house, an early deposit, built over by a wall of the second architectural phase, com- prised a large jar and its contents, FIG. 1.11. The jar was not illustrated, but Evans mentioned that a goblet, likened to those from House C, was found inside it (ibid., 300-1). The goblet is not published; it could be a footed goblet of the EM III or MM I A periods, but could also be a Rounded Goblet of Type 2 which be- longs in the MM I B and MM II A periods. The latter</page><page sequence="47">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 47 ^i^m^SSÜ^^íL^^ÍÍL^r, yMí' ^ PALACL^ PILLAR SCALE OF METRES 1 -5 o 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 5 9 10 IINIIHIII I 1- I 1- H •- * H- H 1 .Fí¿. /.//.

The cup is almost certainly the product of the same workshop that produced Bridge-spouted Jars (947-952) in Group L and therefore should belong in the MM II A period. Both early deposits seem to represent layers of the final stages of the MM II A period, which pre-date the construction of the House of the Sacrificed Oxen. Mackenzie recorded that: Some exceptional fragments of egg-shell texture with deli- cate feather-like motives... [were] found in the interval of the cutting made for the drain running East-West in the passage to the N of the House of the Fallen Blocks (1922 DB (1), 60). This may be a reference to our 998, and could indicate that the last use of the drain belongs to the MM II B period. The main architectural period and most of the con- tents of the building belong to a subsequent and final stage. During the course of excavation Mackenzie fre- quently stated that 'There was no stratification in the deposits' (1922 DB (1), 63), and that: at first it seemed puzzling to find that the pottery did not change its character as one went down but it ultimately became apparent that this was not stratified and consisted of filling thrown in at the time the houses got ruined and were abandoned which seemed to be at the end of the Middle Minoan age (ibid., 44), and that: taking the pottery from the different rooms in the 'House of Sacrifice' separately. . .all the different types of vessels domestic and other exhibiting different phases within MM III occur at all the levels and parts of the same vessel occur in different basements, sometimes as far apart as the North and South areas of the house (ibid., 71). The same confusion was found in the House of the Fallen Blocks and the corridor between the two buildings. With regard to chronology, Mackenzie stated that 'No LM I vases were found in these deposits' (ibid., 63), and that some of the decorated pottery pointed 'to the earlier rather than the later MM III period' (ibid.), but finally concluded, on the basis of comparisons with the pottery from the Temple Repositories and South- West Basements, that the filling took place at the end of MM HI (ibid., 58). Evans later assigned the filling op- eration to the MM III B period (1928, 305). Re-assembly The quantity of pottery found in the two houses is enor- mous. Evans restored a large number of vases from the fill which were photographed as three groups, repro- duced here in PLATES 144-5. A selection of these was drawn from the photographs and used to illustrate the domestic pottery from the fill (Evans 1928, 304 fig. 176). Only one of the illustrated vases, 1010, could be lo- cated and included in the catalogue. The others could not be included without information about their fab- rics and techniques of manufacture. However, they can be compared typologically. This Group is composed of pottery selected from boxes in the KSM from the 'House of the Fallen Blocks and Area' (R IV 2-6 #1 527-1 551) and from the 'House of Sacrifice' (R V 2, 4-6 #1553-1560). A preliminary examination of all the sherds from both houses shows that the material joins throughout, a confirmation of Mackenzie's observations at the time of excavation. It is also apparent that the finds from the two architec- tural periods were not kept apart. This Group, then, contains material that represents more than one period. The selected pottery is 985-1021 in APPENDIX I, illus- trated in PLATES 30, 144-50. Relative date The earliest groups, from below rooms 1 (1000, 1003 and ion) and 5 (995) may be assigned to the MM II A period. To the same period may belong 994, 1004 and 1008-9 which find close parallels in MM II A examples from Phaistos (F. 2516, 5291, 6269, 6271). A few pieces may be assigned to the primary floor deposit of the latest architectural phase on purely sty- listic grounds. 996 is in the Starburst Style, 997 is in the Spiral Banded Style and 998-9 are in the Wavy- line Style, and Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 3, 991-2, all characteristic of the MM II B period. Per- haps also belonging to this period is the 'salt container' in PLATE 144, which is very similar to those of Periods 2 and 3 at Phaistos (Levi 1976, pl. 1 50). The position of the blocks, fallen from the SE angle of the palace, on the floor of the House of the Fallen Blocks indicates that the seismic event responsible for the displacement of the blocks took place before the filling operation in the house. A great deal of the pottery assembled and illustrated by Evans was largely complete and so may have belonged to primary destruction deposits, formed within the houses. By the time of their excavation, they had be- come confused with fragmentary rubbish and fill, per- haps following the main destruction event. Evans sug- gested that certain rooms had been intentionally dug out, soon after the main event, in order to place the two skulls he had found in the corners of rooms 5 and 6, that gave the name to the House of the Sacrificed Oxen (1928, 295). Much of the pottery most likely belongs to the post- destruction filling operation in the area, which may be placed in the MM HI A period on the basis of 985, 989, 1002 and 1005. There are also fragments of Straight- sided Cups of Type 12 with horizontal ridges, but none preserved sufficiently to be inventoried. There are no fragments of MM HI B or later pottery from the fill. Comment The preliminary examination of the kept sherds, from both houses and the corridor in between, shows that</page><page sequence="49">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 49 the material joins throughout, and that it is exactly simi- lar to the pottery from the filling-in of the Koulouras in the West Court, Group E. The latest elements in the pottery are MM HI A and it seems most probable that the filling operation took place in that period. The displaced masonry in the House of the Fallen Blocks is startling evidence of the force of the earth- quake that destroyed the building. It is probably the most convincing evidence of the shock that severely af- fected the palace at Knossos. Evans distinguished be- tween the event here and that in the area of the Loomweight Basement, dating them to the MM HI B and MM II B periods respectively. The present study indicates that the two events are related and should be placed at the end of the MM II B period, marking the end of the Old Palace period at Knossos. PART 8. THE EARLY TOWN AND ROYAL ROAD The Town Drain and Early Houses Excavations in 1926 in the area NW of the House of the Frescoes, to the W of the palace, brought to light parts of two houses that Evans felt represented typical town houses of the MM period, and a drainage channel, FIG. 1. 1 2, (Evans 1928, 366-70). Group O. The Town Drain Context The drain was earlier than the town houses, as it could be traced beneath House B and the Royal Road nearby. Evans reported that the drain was found filled with Fig. 1. 1 2.

Re-assembly Evans published one cup which he assigned to the group of pottery from the drain (ibid., 369 fig. 205). The cup, 1033, was photographed together, PLATE 151, with two similar cups, 1030 and 1032, and it is probable that all three were found together. The rest of this Group is early vases in the HM, inventoried at the same time as the three cups and the pottery in Group P. The evi- dence is very circumstantial, but the pottery seems to form quite a coherent chronological group. Relative date Evans first published 1033 as MM I A (1928, 369), but later revised it to MM I B, calling it a transitional piece (1935, 106 n.3). Given the fact that it is wheelmade and decorated with barbotine patterns, the later date seems more appropriate. A similar date could be suggested for 1030 and 1032, on the basis of their crinkled rims and the fact that 1032 is a Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 3. The other pottery which may come from the drain includes Straight-sided Cups of Type 2 (1022-24) and (1026-27) in the Woven Style, and a Tall-rimmed An- gular Cup of Type 2 (1025) which are also characteris- tic of the MM I B period. Hogarth 9s Early Heap At a point SW of the West Court, Hogarth excavated a deposit of early pottery that he found 'Heaped up be- tween two houses' (1900, pl. XII 12; and Welch 1901, 80). Among the illustrated finds are a Straight-sided Cup of Type 2 in the Woven Style (1901, pl. VHb) and a Jug with Cut-away Spout of Type 1 (ibid., pl. Vic). Though little more can be said about the deposit, the published examples suggest it belongs to the MM I B period. Group P. The Early Town Houses Context Little stratigraphical information is given for the con- text of the pottery from the Town Houses, labelled A and B, other than the fact that it was found 'At a depth Fig. 1. 13. Drawing of selected pottery in Groups P and N (Evans 1928, 37ifig- 2&lt;&gt;6): (a) 1048; (b) 1039; (c) 996; (d) 1043; (e) 1046; (f) 1035.</page><page sequence="51">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 5 1 of between five and six metres' below the surface on the basement floors of both houses (Evans 1928, 369). Re-assembly This Group comprises material from the basement floor deposits in houses A and B built over the Town Drain. Evans illustrated some of the finds in a drawing, repro- duced here in FIG. 1.13. There is also a photograph in the Evans Archive that identifies pieces in the HM as belonging to this Group, PLATE 155. The material in the KSM, said to come from the area of the Town Houses and Drain (Pendlebury 1933: P III 5-7), appears to be mixed but contains much sherd material of the MM III A period. One cup (1044) could be mended from fragments in box #1484. The other elements in the Group are vases in the HM, 1037, 1 040-1, and 1047, included because they were inventoried at the same time as the vases illus- trated as having come from the deposits. Evans restoration of the base in FIG. 1.13 a into an elongated amphora may be revised if we compare the preserved base with footed goblet 605 and similar con- temporary goblets from Group N, 1006. The invento- ried pottery, 1035-49, *s illustrated in PLATES 154-6. Relative date The pottery includes a Straight-sided Cup of Type 12 (1037) and sufficient examples of White-spotted deco- ration to suggest that the Group belong in the MM III A period, as Evans proposed (1928, 369, 371 fig. 206). Comment Evans' typical town houses of the MM period could well have been built at the time of Old Palace, but the only evidence of their occupational history can be as- signed to the MM HI A period, after the events that mark the end of the Old Palace period. Hogarth fs Later Heap At a point W of the West Court and most likely to the S of the Royal Road, Hogarth excavated what he regarded as the richest find of Kamares Ware he made in the town (1900, pl. XII 12; and Welch 1901, 80 figs. 7-9, 12, 18, 19). It was found as a 'heap about two metres in circumference' in the corner of a small yard on the S side of a house. The illustrated pottery includes two large jugs, that are quite close parallels for 1046 in Group P (1900, figs. 8 and 9), a juglet with plastic 'corn' deco- ration painted in the White-spotted Style (ibid., fig. 7), and two small jugs, one of which is a Jug with Horizon- tal Spout of Type 3 in the White-spotted Style (ibid., fig. 19). All are quite characteristic of the MM HI A period as defined by Evans, who used this material with Group P to form his definition (1921, 415-6 figs. 299a, 3ooa-b), and suggest that this 'heap' may be part of a similar event. Royal Road South/ Basements M. S. F. Hood conducted a series of stratigraphie exca- vations on the S side of the Royal Road in 1957 to 196 1 (Hood 1962; 1966). In 1959 and i960 he cleared the basement rooms of a structure, that contained three well-stratified floor deposits of the earlier part of the MM period (Cadogan et al 1993, 26). Beneath the ear- liest was a 'deep fill of solid pottery' of the MM I A period (Hood 1959, 19-20; i960, 23). The lowest floor contained numerous fragments of pottery in the Poly- chrome Geometric Style and seems to correspond to our late MM I A period. The middle floor included pottery in the Alternating Red and White, and White Banded Styles, and was compared to Levi's Phase la at Phaistos, thus closest to our MM I B. The latest floor contained Egg-shell Ware and the first appearance of Crude Ware, both of which are characteristic of the MM II A period in the palace. At the top of the latest floor deposit was an Egyptian scarab of late XHth-early XIHth Dynasty type (Hood 1959, 19 fig. 31; CMS II, 2, 34). The precise contents of the three floor deposits should go a long way to filling out the pottery descrip- tions in Chapter 2, as the Royal Road Stratigraphy should be much more reliable than the earlier efforts of Evans and his colleagues. Meanwhile, the preliminary results seem to confirm the earlier part of the sequence suggested for the palace deposits. Further West Extension of Royal Road (SEX) Excavations by Peter Warren in 1979 to 1982 on the site of the proposed Stratigraphical Museum Exten- sion, abbreviated SEX, revealed a long historical se- quence of the town's history beginning in the MM I A period. In 1980 and 1981 he cleared a room in a structure apparently built in MM II. The room was reported to have contained: A substantial pottery deposit of c. 60 vases, mostly undecorated but ranging from large jars to tiny miniatures; there are bridge-spouted jars, a cylindrical pyxis, an imi- tation of a stone bowl, carinated cups and a metal-imitat- ing chalice cup (Catling 1982, 53). Nearby were other 'MM IF rooms that produced about 15 more vases. Warren and Hankey (1989, 57) add the detail that there were at least two examples of Straight- sided Cups in Ridged Ware with added white spots found in the MM II rooms. The Pyxis is very similar to 537 in Group E (Catling 1982, 53 fig. 116). The chalice is a reference to a Short-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 3. Associated stylistically with the 'MM IF pottery are the cups found in F/FG (Warren 1 981, 74 figs. 3, 4). One is a Straight-sided Cup in Precision Stamped Ware, with shells as the motif; above and below are bands of interlocking reversed-S motifs in tiny white dots very similar to those on rhyton 395 (ibid., fig. 3). Another is a Crude Cup of Type 4 (ibid., fig. 4 right). On present</page><page sequence="52">52 RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS evidence it seems that the primary floor deposits in SEX F/FG, assigned by the excavator to MM II, should be given the further precise designation of MM II B and perhaps associated with events at the end of the Old Palace period. Villa Ariadne - North Ken Wardle's excavations in the field to the N of the Villa Ariadne have revealed traces of an early building, beneath the Roman structures that are the focus of the fieldwork (French 1994, 75). A large deposit of over 60 vases or whole profiles, almost certainly signalling one event, contains numerous close parallels for Group A and Hogarth's pits on Gypsades, and thus seems to have been formed late in the MM I B period or early in MM II A. A more recent group with Crude Ware may be distinguished (Tomlinson 1996, 42). Acropolis Houses (KSP 1975) H. W. and E. A. Catling with D. Smyth conducted a rescue excavation on the plot of the Staphylakis family on the E slopes of the Acropolis Hill in 1975, abbrevi- ated KSP 1975, (Catling et al 1979). Despite the ef- fects of deep agricultural ploughing, the excavators suc- ceeded in isolating three architectural phases, which contained six deposits all belonging to the neopalatial period. The earliest deposits, A and B, are associated with the basement room of a structure, the remainder of which has not survived. Deposit A was interpreted as the material left in place, when the building was aban- doned; Deposit B was seen to comprise material gath- ered up by the builders of the subsequent MM III build- ing on the site, and used to level the terrace created by the early basement's walls (ibid., 78). The pottery in Deposit A comprises a large percent- age of Crude forms none of which corresponds to the MM II A and MM II B types described in Chapter 2, see below p. 82-5, but include the Everted Rim Bowl also found in period 4, and thus MM III, at Phaistos (ibid., fig. 16.3; Warren and Hankey 1989, 58). There is a single example of a ridged cup similar to Straight- sided Cups of Type 12 (Catling et al., fig. 16.5), and several more in Deposit B, including five decorated in the White-spotted Style (ibid., fig. 18.49, 95~8; 1952, 114, 116, 119). Deposit B also contains two rounded cups in the Heavy Spiral Style (ibid., fig. 18.91-2). The pottery wares and styles in Deposits A and B were treated together, because of their close similari- ties to each other. Given the correspondences with Phaistos period 4, it seems most likely that the primary deposit A was formed after the end of the MM II B period, though probably after not too long an interval, as the close similarity of cups in the Heavy Spiral Style with those from Phaistos period 3, and the ridged cups of MM II B at Knossos and Archanes would seem to suggest. Deposits A and B fit well with Group P and Hogarth's Later Heap to provide a ceramic definition of the MM III A period. Trial KV In 1969 M. Popham conducted a rescue excavation at a site called Sochara, on the slopes of the Acropolis due W of the palace, abbreviated Trial KV (Popham 1974). The trials revealed the basement rooms of a substantial building, perhaps part of a water system. The deposit in the central room was found in a state, that suggested a primary deposit created during the destruction of the room: some of the cups and bowls were found to have been stacked. Beneath the destruction level was a layer of silt belonging to the room's period of use prior to the destruction. The silt layer contained five vases, including a Crude Bowl of Type 2 (ibid., 185 fig. 5.1), a Crude Pyxis (ibid., fig. 5.2) and a Crude Cup of Type 4; all types that seem to originate in the MM HA period and continue into MM HB. The destruction deposit contained a large number of crude forms including Crude Bowls of Types 1 (ibid., fig. 6. 1-5), and 4 (ibid., fig. 6. 8); a Rounded Bridge- spouted Jar of Type 6 (ibid., 188 fig. 7. 2 pl. 29a), large jars decorated in the Spiral Band Style (ibid., pls. 30e; 32a), a Hand Lamp of Type 2 (ibid., fig. 8. 9) and a Pedestalled Lamp of Type 2 (ibid., pl. 32c), all of which strongly indicate a date in the MM II B period for the formation of the deposit, as suggested by the excavator (ibid., 191). Gypsades Hill In March of 1900, while Evans and Mackenzie began clearing the Kephala, D. G. Hogarth conducted a se- ries of trial excavations in the surrounding valley (Hogarth 1900). On the E slopes of Gypsades, just to the W of the modern road, he cleared two houses of the neopalatial period, which have come to be known as 'Hogarth's Houses' (ibid., pl. XII. 6 &amp; 7 'Early Houses'; Hood and Smyth 1981, no. 297). Trials nearby revealed a number of early contexts, likened to receptacles, num- bered 58. No. 5 was a plastered pit 1.70 m deep (1900, 70 pl. VII 'cistern'). The pit or cistern was found to contain several almost complete vases including a three- handled jug in Barbotine Ware (Hogarth and Welch 1901, 79 pl. VI. 1), and 'Hundreds of fragments mostly unpainted cups of metallic type' (ibid.), a reference to Straight-sided Cups of Type 2. Near the cistern he: Opened three circular excavations, sunk from 3 to 10 feet into the soft rock. They can have been neither wells, for their lowest point is far above the water level of the vicin- ity, nor cisterns, because not being plastered they would not have retained water. Possibly they were originally in- tended for the storage of grain; but more probably they were cut... to contain what was actually found in them namely a mass of broken... vases and other rubbish, evi-</page><page sequence="53">RE-INVESTIGA TION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS 53 dently cleared out of the neighbouring houses when re- stored after the conflagration of which the large house [House A in Hogarth 1900, pl. Ill] shows traces (ibid.). The pottery illustrated from these pits includes a Straight-sided Cup of Type 2 in the Woven Style (Hogarth and Welch ibid., pl. Vila), and fragments decorated in a similar manner (ibid., pl. VII f, g, h). To the N of 'Hogarth's Houses', S. Hood in 1958 excavated a 'Kind of rock-cut basement', in which he found two Straight-sided Cups of Type 2 and a spouted jar, all in the Woven Style of MM I B (1959, 19 fig. 29). The cisterns and pits on Gypsades seem to have been filled at a time close to the formation of Group A and the similar deposit at Villa Ariadne North, all contain- ing pottery of the MM I B period. Mavrospilio Tombs In 1926, Evans excavated six tombs on the W slopes of Ailias below Mavrospilio. John Forsdyke was asked to continue the excavation in 1927, when the total of tombs was brought to 22, and publish the results (Forsdyke 1927). Few of the tombs were undisturbed and there is no single primary burial of the Old Palace period. There is, however, a context that may belong to one period. In Tomb XVII a pit had been dug into the floor at the S end of the chamber. The pit had been used as a recep- tacle, then covered over with pithos fragments and thus not disturbed by later burials. The pit contained skulls, bones, beads and pottery (ibid., 279-81 fig. 34). Among the pottery are a number of pieces that can be placed in both the MM II A and MM II B periods, but also a Crude Cup of Type 3 (ibid., pl. 23.24), and a Crude Jug of Type 2 (ibid., pl. 23.32), which belong only in the latter. The pit seems to have been used during MM II and sealed at some point in MM II B. If the 'cor- roded iron cube' was in fact sealed in the pit, as the report suggests, it would be the earliest piece of iron in the Aegean (ibid., 279, pl. 23.2). The latest material from Tomb VI includes a large jug in the White-spotted Style (ibid., 295 fig. 49 left) and a conical cup with everted rim comparable to those from Deposit B in the Knossos Acropolis Houses (ibid., pl. 23 VI. 7). Though small and insufficiently published, the material from Tomb VI could be included in the groups formed during the MM HI A period.</page><page sequence="54">2 Pottery fabrics, wares and styles INTRODUCTION The pottery of the Old Palace period in Crete has been called 'Kamares Ware' since its discovery in the Kamares cave last century (Mariani 1895; Myres 1895). Unfortunately, the term lacks concise definition and seems to include all Cretan MBA pottery regardless of fabric, manufacturing technique, decoration or origin (Walberg 1976; MacGillivray 1984c, 250). At the turn of the last century, the term was even used to describe an entire period, despite the cautionary statement that it cannot be used for both a period and technique (Dawkins 1904, 192). A possible definition of 'Kamares Ware' might in- clude the pottery of the MM I B- III A periods made with the white clays of central Crete including the vari- ous tempered products; but this would still be largely stylistic, as the white clays of E Crete can only be dis- tinguished from those of the centre with a comprehen- sive programme of pétrographie and chemical analysis. Until there is a new definition of what 'Kamares Ware' might include, it remains an unsatisfactory designation and is not used here. The first studies of the MM pottery of central Crete by Mackenzie (1906) and Ban ti (1940) were the stand- ard introductory works until the analyses of Walberg (1976) and the comprehensive and detailed typology of Levi and Carinci (1988). None of these studies, how- ever, analyses the pottery from a technological view- point and the last three deal primarily with the pottery of Phaistos, which does not include all of the forms, wares and styles that occur in N central Crete. The pottery from the early levels of the palace at Knossos is as plentiful and varied in fabric and decora- tion as one would expect of a cosmopolitan centre. The present study is necessarily selective, as the intention is to define the most common types, and the wares and styles in which they appear, in order to outline a ce- ramic sequence at Knossos alone. The examples used are those which could be assigned with confidence to the Groups re-investigated in Chapter 1 , although ref- erence is made to occurrences of types, wares and styles from relevant contexts elsewhere. The pottery is considered first from a technological point of view, as the first phase in the manufacture of any pot is the preparation of the clay paste. For this reason, the present analysis groups the pottery on the basis of macroscopic observations of its fabric and be- gins with the most common, Fine Buff, and continues with the minority, that is less frequent, fabrics. The period treated here covers a time of major changes in ceramic technology. The most obvious change, but also one of the most difficult to detect and describe accurately, is the experimentation with and wide-spread adoption of the radial potter's wheel, evi- dent in those examples with the grooves and texture of thrown pottery (Momigliano 1 991, 247-9, 264-5; Gillis 1990, 6-7). There could have been a variety of tech- niques in simultaneous use that lie, technologically speaking, between forming a pot from coils and throw- ing it on the well-centred radial potter's wheel, to ex- ploit the full force of a centrifuge. Those pieces that cannot be placed at either end are here classified under the deliberately ambiguous heading of 'proto- wheelmade', pending future analyses focusing on for- mation techniques. PART 1. THE FINE BUFF POTTERY The fabric used most commonly in the MM pottery of Knossos is based on a distinctive light coloured clay in a highly refined state, without obvious temper. Appar- ently dependent on firing conditions, the fabric may vary from light buff to grey in colour. Visually, the clay corresponds to Wilson's Buff Fabric of EM II A Knossos (1985, 3O7&gt; 319) and Momigliano's Fabric I for the EM HI pottery of Knossos (1991, 245). It may relate to the Fine Buff fabric of Kommos, although the Knossos fab- ric seems to be harder and more dense (Betancourt 1990, 5-9). One certain source for the clay is the region around the N, W and S slopes of Mt. Juktas, but similar clay beds are said to occur all the way from Juktas to the Mesara (Day 1988). Once refined, these are virtually indistinguishable to the naked eye, although there seems to be a greater tendency for the Phaistos pottery to fire grey. In the case of Fine Buff, then, we cannot at present give a more precise source than central Crete. This may explain why the fine wares of Knossos and Phaistos can be distinguished only stylistically, and even then, for the present, only in certain instances.</page><page sequence="55">56 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES i. The Fine Buff Wares and Styles The ware groupings proposed here are determined on the basis of techniques in the manufacture and decora- tion of the pottery. The content of designs or repeated use of similar motifs are the criteria for suggesting sty- listic groupings. Pared Ware A distinctive group of handmade pottery is character- ized by signs of paring, or the shaving away of clay with a cutting tool in downward strokes, on the lower exte- rior of the vase. The group includes Rounded Goblets of Type i with plain (1-7, 895), dark-on-buff sprayed (15-16, 892-4, 896-7), and monochrome coated (671) surfaces, Straight-sided Cups of Type 1 with plain sur- faces, (8-14), and Tumblers of Type 1 with dark-on- buff decorated (898), or monochrome coated (17) sur- faces. The examples are in Groups A, G and L, in types that belong in the MM I B period. This manner of fin- ishing a vase is quite common in the MM I A pottery of Knossos where it is found on similar types (Momigliano 1 99 1, 264). The MM I B examples may represent the last products in this ware, which seems gradually to have ceased with the adoption and popular use of the radial centered potter's wheel. Barbotine Ware Small dabs of clay or slurry, applied in relief to the sur- face of a vase to form part of the decorative pattern, characterize Barbotine Ware (Foster 1982). The exam- ples employing this technique in Fine Buff Fabric have 'prickles' (see Betancourt 1985a, 83 fig. 58c), which are used to outline or give structure to the decoration or to accent the angle on an angular form. The barbotine technique is used in both handmade and wheelmade pottery on Tumblers of Type 4 (977), Rounded Gob- lets of Type 3 (226), Conical Goblets of Type 3 (227), Straight-sided Cups of Type 5 (117), Tall-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 1 (613), Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 2 (926-7), and other forms. The examples are in Groups A, F, J, L, M, and O, and in types that belong in the MM I B and MM II A periods. The use of barbotine decoration begins in the neolithic period in Crete, is evident on the MM I A pot- tery of Knossos (Foster 1982, 147-8; Momigliano 1991, 267), but has come to be regarded as most typical of the MM I B period (Betancourt 1985a, 83). It may well be that the manufacture of most examples of Barbotine Ware should be assigned to the MM I B period, as nu- merous examples in Period 1 groups at Phaistos sug- gest (e.g. F. 61, 62, 21 16, 2169, 2170); but it may have continued into MM II A, as the examples in Groups F, J and L and in period 2 contexts at Phaistos (Fiandra 1980, pls. 32.10, 35.2, 44.2, 49.2, 54.10, 55.10) suggest; a date in keeping with the example found at Haraga in Egypt (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, Ha.4). However, a much more detailed study is very much called for, build- ing on the work of Foster by isolating the different types of 'barbs', both technologically and stylistically, within a framework of groups defined by chemical and pétro- graphie analyses. Then the exact dates for the differ- ent classes within Barbotine Ware can be assessed. Eggshell Ware The most distinctive and rarest of the palatial pottery is in 'Egg-shell Ware', so-called by Evans because the walls of vases are comparable in thickness to the walls of small birds' eggs (1921, 241). The term has been used, erroneously, to describe fine polychrome decorated MM pottery in general (for example Betancourt [1985a, 94] wrongly cites 926 as an example of 'Egg-shell Ware') but is restricted here to examples of Fine Buff Pottery with walls less than 0.1 cm thick. The technical feat represented by this ware may have been achieved by the careful shaving of a vase at high speed revolutions, as it would have been almost impossible to throw a pot of such extreme delicacy. Another possibility is that the body was moulded. A very thin sheet of highly refined clay could have been smoothed onto the inside of a mould, in effect taking the place of a metal sheet, as would have been the process for vessels in gold, silver or copper. One problem with this theory is that there are no traces of mould lines left on the vases. We may assume that the aim of the potter, besides the obvious display of virtuosity, was to produce the ceramic equivalent to the fine, and presumably more valuable, metal wares. The only examples from Knossos come from the Royal Pottery Stores, Groups F and J, and are Straight-sided (615, 798), and Rounded (616- 23, 799-801) Cups. There are also examples without specific provenance in the AM (1929.405; 1938.577). The limited repertory and extremely fine workmanship evident in these pieces may indicate that they were the products of a single, highly specialized workshop. True Egg-shell Ware remains a hallmark of the MM II A period. It was certainly the finest pottery of its time and can hardly have been intended for everyday use. Nevertheless, a cup from Kato Symi may belong to this class (Lembesi 1994, 101 fig. 96) and two fragments are known from Palaikastro (MacGillivray, Sackett et al. 1992, fig. 14.3). Two cups were exported to Melos (Papagianopoulou 1991, nos. 348, 358), one to Kea (Overbeck 1989, 183 pl. 85 DG 20) and perhaps an- other to Israel (Yadin et ai i960, 91 pl. 1 15.13). The rounded cup form, mouldings and decoration on this ware link it directly to the cups and bowls of the 'Tôd Treasure', discussed in Chapter 3, Part x. Shallow Grooved Ware A small group of early wheelmade vases has thin hori- zontal incisions or rough grooves cut into the exterior of the body. These are distinguished from the incisions on the later Precision Grooved Ware by their shallow- ness and random displacement on the vase. The tech-</page><page sequence="56">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 57 nique appears on Squat Rounded (106), and Angular (93, 95-7) Cups and a Tumbler of Type 4 (169). Its occurrence in Group A allows the origin of this ware to be assigned to the MM I B period at Knossos and, per- haps, Juktas (Karetsou 1978, fig. 1 1 .2). It may continue into MM II A as examples in similar forms are quite numerous in periods 1 and 2 at Phaistos (F. 397, 626, 2115, 2499, 3490a, 5022, 5273, 5606a, 5644, 6571; Fiandra 1980, pls. 36.4, 37.2, 9) and in MM II contexts at Kommos (Betancourt 1990, nos. 371, 383) and Malia (Stürmer 1993, nos. 2, 8, 9). A related ware occurs in pottery of similar forms and date in Fine Red Fabric, see 14 1-2 below. A clear link to metal originals is suggested by a cup fragment in this ware with spool handle in the AM (AE 839) (Evans 1921, fig. i83bi; Matthäus 1980, pl. 76.5). A stone equivalent to 95 is a cup from Myrtos-Pyrgos (Hankey 1980, pl. 76 MP 73/10). Precision Grooved Ware A number of fine wheelmade vases have distinctive, precision tooled and evenly spaced horizontal grooves cut in groups into their sides. These may represent a carefully measured successor to Shallow Grooved Ware. The technique is used on Straight-sided (408), Rounded (413-21, 430, 987, 1045) and Short-rimmed Angular (41 1-12) Cups and a Jug with Horizontal Spout (1042). Many of the examples are decorated in the White-spot- ted Style which, along with the ware's frequency in Groups E, N and P and its use of late pottery types, indicates that its greatest popularity was at the end of the Old Palace period, perhaps originating during MM II B, as examples from period 3 at Phaistos suggest (F. 783* 3°89&gt; 6248; Fiandra 1980, pl. 42.1), and continu- ing into the MM IH A period. A very similar effect in silver may be seen on a cup from Enkomi in Cyprus (Matthäus 1980, pl. 76.3). Stamped and Impressed Ware A group of early wheelmade pottery has designs stamped or impressed into the side of the vase while still wet. The stamps are generally repeated horizon- tally in a haphazard manner. On some examples grooves are impressed to create a three-dimensional background to painted patterns. This class, called 'Stamped Ware' by Evans (1921, 242), includes rounded cups in Egg- shell Ware (616, 799-801) and an angular cup (233). It is quite distinct from the later Precision Stamped Ware, which uses the stamps to form a coherent and meas- ured decorative pattern and on which stamps are em- ployed quite differently. Its presence in Groups F and J and its coincidence with Egg-shell Ware place this ware in the MM II A period. Other examples from Knossos are without exact provenance in the AM (AE 1627), BM (A528.3) and HM (4342), but may have origi- nated in the Monolithic Pillar Basement or North- West Pit. Examples of a very similar ware are quite common in period 2 at Phaistos (F. 359, 398, 865, 986, 5759; Fiandra 1980, pls. 35.4, 7, 44.13, 46.5, 47.2, 7, 48.4, 9, 49.8, 52.1, 4, 53.5, 11, 54.13, 15, 60.1, 2; Levi 1976, fig. 683, pl. LXII) and in MM II at Kommos (Betancourt 1990, nos. 108, 353, 375, 376, 380, 382, ion). There are also examples from Kato Symi (Lembesi 1994, 101 fig. 96) and Phylakopi in Melos (Papagianopoulou 1991, nos. 347, 348, 358). An example from Haraga in Egypt helps to align MM II A with the middle of the XHth Dynasty (Evans 1928, 211 fig. 119, 228; Kemp and Merrillees 1980, Ha. 5) It is evident, as Evans pointed out (1921, 242), that the stamps used here very likely imitate, or may even be the same as, those used on metal wares, which Egg- shell Ware certainly copies (MacGillivray 1987). The impressed lines could be compared to the chasing tech- nique used in finishing metal products; perhaps the most accomplished examples of which are the gold cups and bowls in the 'Tod Treasure' (see Chapter 3, Part x). Precision Stamped Ware A distinctive class of wheelmade vases, with a meas- ured use of stamps, occurs in some quantity in Group E. This Precision Stamped Ware, like Stamped and Impressed Ware, employs dies, but instead of being pushed into the wall of the vase, the vase is pushed from within (leaving a fingerprint) into a form. The dies are now in the form of circles, star or sun motifs, spirals, concentric circles and shells, arranged in such a way as to be supplemented or connected with painted designs to form well ordered decorative patterns. The technique is used on Straight-sided (433-4), and Rounded (237, 436-44) Cups and on a Bridge-spouted Jar (445). The mixed context of Group E does not allow for a firm date in either the MM II B or MM IH A periods in the palace, though a cup from a group near the North House on the Royal Road, deposited in MM II, sug- gests the former (Warren 1 981, 74 fig. 3). This is firmly supported by a number of almost identical examples from Phaistos period 3 (F. 1041, 1477; Borda 1946, 21 pl. XI, 77406; Pernier 1935, pls. XXIVa, XXXb, XXXV ), including one also decorated in the Sunrise Style (ibid., pl. XXXb), which place this ware in the MM II B period. Similar examples are known from Kommos (Betancourt 1990, nos. 378, 11 59, 1160, 1191, 1209, lZ°li lS%9)y Palaikastro (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 16 fig. 11; Bernini 1995, 7* fig- 1352) and Thera (Papagiannopoulou 1991, nos. 295-6), and a large closed vessel from Kea IV may be a Cycladic imitation (Overbeck 1989, 136 pl. 70 no. 26). A silver cup from Byblos gives a good impression of what the metal inspirations for this ceramic class might have been (Montet 1928, pl. CXI; E.

Early Printed Ware The use of a device, perhaps of clay, wood, leather or sponge, dipped in paint and applied repeatedly, either directly onto the buff surface or a dark monochrome coat, to imprint a continuous pattern may be observed on a group of early wheelmade vases. The motifs em- ployed are a sponge pattern, 114, 1032, a roughly cir- cular sponge or dot pattern, 628-30, likened by Mac- kenzie to 'brush dabs' (1902 PB (2), 69), a crescent or 'maggot-like' pattern, 624-7, 798, 976, which contin- ues to be used in Late Printed Ware, and irregular shapes, 631-2. This ware is represented by a Rounded Goblet of Type 3 (976), Straight-sided Cups of Type 6 (624-30) (Mackenzie 1902 PB (2), 68, mentions the bases of eleven other examples), a Rounded Cup of Type 3 (631), a Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 3 (114), and a bridge-spouted jar (632). Its occurrence in Groups A, F, J and O and on early pottery types confirms that it begins during the MM I B period and continues to be made into MM II A. A similar ware is found in periods 1 and 2 at Phaistos (E 361, 418, 1926, 1941, 2175, 2314, 2315, 5479a; Pelagatti 1962, in and pl. 14 nos. 1 and 2; Fiandra 1973, pl. 23. 1,2), Kommos (Betancourt 1990, no. 1006) and the Porti tholos (Xanthoudides 1924, pl. VI no. 5069). These ceramic prints should be viewed as part of a wider appeal in printed design, as seen in wall painting (Evans 1930, 362), and thus perhaps textiles during the early stages of the Old Palace period. We might wonder if printing and stamping in the design world may not have been inspired by the increase in the use of seals in administration early in the palace period. Late Printed Ware The successor to Early Printed Ware may be seen on a group of Straight-sided Cups of Type 10 (223, 293-8), which have the crescent or 'maggot-like' pattern simi- lar to that used in the early version, although no longer applied directly onto the buff surface of the clay. The patterns are now printed on a cream/ white horizontal band as well as on a dark monochrome surface. The examples of this ware in Group E and its use of Straight- sided Cups of Type 10 indicate that it belongs in either the MM II B or the MM HI A period. As it would be difficult to imagine that much time elapsed between the early and late versions of the ware, it could be sug- gested that the late examples were made during the course of the MM II B period; apparently, printing ce- ramics does not survive until the end. A fragment of a large vase from a Group E context, in PLATE 63 upper right hand corner, appears to show the use of printed patterns on what may be a tempered fabric, though the fragment could not be located for verification. Ridged Ware One of the most distinctive wares is characterized by fine tooling to create evenly spaced, horizontal ridges giving an impression of stacked metal plates. This tech- nique characterizes Straight-sided Cups of Types 1 1 (423-6), and 12 (404-7, 1037, 1044; and numerous un- catalogued sherds from Group E contexts in the KSM) and Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 3 (409-12, 991-2). Fragments of a large bridge-spouted jar (422), are also in this ware. Its frequency in Groups E (401"" 12, 423-6), N (991-2), and P (1037, 1044), in late ce- ramic types, often decorated in the White-Spotted Style, and its appearance in Deposits A and B at the Knossos Acropolis Houses (Catling et al 1979, V. 49, 95-8) places Ridged Ware in the MM IH A period, although it may be unwise to discount an origin late in MM II B (see below, p. 58). Ridged Ware seems to be a Knossian product, as there is only one possible example from Phaistos (Levi 1976, 477 fig. 730). Its export and imitation may be seen else- where in Crete at Gournia (Boyd-Hawes et al. 1908, 38 pl. VI.34), the Trapeza Cave (Pendlebury et al. 1936, 62-3 fig. 14. 548) and Palaikastro (MacGillivray, Sackett et al 1992, fig. 14.2), and in the Cyclades at Phylakopi in Melos, Akrotiri in Thera (Papagianopoulou 1991 , nos. 263, 340), Mikre Vigla in Naxos (Barber and Hadjianastasiou 1989, 107 fig. 22 no. 420) and Ayia Irini in Kea (Davis 1986, 81 pl. 28 U 79-82). A later survival may be seen in cups of the MM III B period from a cave shelter in Poros (Lembessi 1967, pl. 180b; Muhly 1992, nos. 35-7). Pattern Painted Ware A number of styles, defined on the basis of decorative patterns, may be observed in Pattern Painted Ware. Detailed analyses of the decorative styles on MM pot- tery have been published by Walberg (1976; 1983; 1992). However, as her classification fails to account for tech- nical differences such as fabric and surface treatment, and uses broad, loosely defined chronological borders, it contributes little of use to the present study. Instead, I have chosen to describe some of the more striking styles, according to what the decorative motifs or pat- terns may represent. White-banded Style. The simplest decorative style consists of one or more thick, white-painted bands applied horizontally on the dark monochrome surface of wheelmade vases. Single bands appear on Rounded Goblets of Type 2 (no, 162-3, 682, 918-19). Single or multiple bands are found on a Rounded Goblet of Type</page><page sequence="58">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 59 3 (in), Straight-sided Cups of Types 2 (789-90), 5 (1 12-13), and 6 (636), on pyxides (648, 683, 760, 806, 924), and on large jars (791-4). The occurrence of this style in Groups A (1 10-13, 1 15), B (162-3), F (636, 648), G (682-3), H (760), I (789-94), J (806) and L (923-4) place it in the MM I B and MM II A periods. A single example from a period 2 context at Phaistos confirms the Knossian dates (F. 89), as do examples of a related style at Palaikastro (MacGillivray, Sackett et al. 1992, 133 figs, ili, 12.2). A close parallel for 113 is from Porti in the Mesara (Xanthoudides 1924, no. 51 19). The examples in Old Palace contexts may represent the end of a style begun in EM III and/or MM I A at Knossos (Momigliano 1991, 245-9). Diagonal Red and White Style, A small group of handmade vases is decorated with pairs of red or orange lines outlined with pairs of white lines and placed diagonally or, in the case of goblets, spiraling outward from the base to the rim. This pattern is found on Conical Goblets of Type 1 (609-10, 899) and examples from the early floor beneath the Room of the Stone Pier in PLATE 141 (bottom, second from right) and the Vat Room Deposit (Momigliano 1 991, 172 no. 4 pl. 23), a Conical Goblet of Type 2 (55), Tall-rimmed Angular Cups of Types 1 (613 - where it is used on Barbotine Ware) and 2 (71-2), and an Angular Bridge-spouted Jar of Type ib(9O5). The occurrence of this style in Groups A (55, 71-2), F (609-10, 613), and L (899, 905), and its use on early ceramic types, place it for certain in the MM I B period, with the possibility that it continued into MM II A. The fact that the style appears on a restricted number of similar handmade forms suggests that the above exam- ples may all be products of the same workshop, in which case the examples from Groups F and L could be taken either as survivors, or as indicators of earlier, MM I B, floors in the Royal Pottery Stores and Early Olive Press floor. The date in MM I B may be strengthened by ex- amples of this style in the destruction debris at the SW Palace angle, see above Chapter 1 . Woven Style. A large number of handmade vases are decorated with patterns in thick, powdery white, red and orange paint on a thick, lustrous dark monochrome surface. The patterns may be horizontal, diagonal or vertical and employ linear, circular, interlocking and floral motifs in a complexity of designs, whose description lies beyond the scope of the present study; a selection is illustrated in FIGS. 2.1-3. The patterns are those that one might imagine to have been inspired by woven textiles, in that they are regularly laid out in measured, well-defined and geometrically spaced zones, and the colours are made to alternate within the designs; very similar to the Geometric and Deximata styles of traditional Cretan textiles (Charvalia and Antonopoulou 1986). This style is found on Straight-sided Cups of Types 2 (31-47, 56-67, 155-6, 173-4, 178-88, 611-12, 674- 5, 797, 1026-7), and 3 (68, 189-91), a Tall-rimmed An- gular Cup of Type ia (192), a Shallow Angular Bowl of Type 1 (50), Angular Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 2 (75, 193-7), Squat Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars (73- 4), Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 2 (46-7, 76- 7), a jug (200), and large jar (614). The frequency of this style in Group A (37-41, 46-7, 50, 56-68, 73-7), and its occurrence in Groups B (155-6), F (611-12, 614), G (674-5), J (797), and 0 (1026-7), and its use on early ceramic types place it with some confidence in the MM I B period, but with the possible continuation into MM II A. Some of the motifs used in this style are also found on con- temporary wheelmade pottery, for example similar dot rosettes also appear on 655, 662 and 942-4, and the row of white dots with superimposed red line on 183 is also found on 203, 211 and the 'Karmi Cup' (Stewart 1962). This is very much a style of the Knossos region with examples from Juktas (Karetsou 1978, 247-9 figs- ll- 6, 7; 12.4), Phourni Q. and E. Sakellarakis 1972, pl. 5a), and Gournes (Zois 1969, 22 pls. 27 no. 7046, 28 no. 7014a). It is found rarely in E Crete (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, pl. IVg) and the Mesara (Vasilakis 1990, 44 fig. 14e), though there are several examples among the earliest Cretan exports to Phylakopi in Melos (Papagiannopoulou 1991, nos. 337-8, 382, 386). There is a closely related and contemporary style from period 1 at Phaistos (F. 62, 2029, 2171, 2276, 2315, 5398, 5473- 4, 5482, 5939, 5946). A predecessor to this style may be seen in the Poly- chrome Geometric Style of the MM I A period (Mac- kenzie 1906, 246), discussed in Part 4 below. Sunrise Style. One of the most distinctive styles is set around a white design composed of two concentric semi- circles with upright petals or rays above, possibly representing a stylized sunrise. The main motif alternates most frequently with red 'coralline' designs (Walberg 1976, 69) outlined in white, less frequently with vertical strokes and occasionally is represented on its own. Examples are 280-4, 336-7, 385-7. All are from Group E and could thus belong in ei- ther MM II B or MM III A. The earlier date is strongly suggested by the popularity of this style in the destruc- tion deposits of period 3 at Phaistos (F. 341, 441, 445, 801, 950a, 1358; Pernier 1935, 220 fig. 97, 262 fig. 145, figs. 150 left, 177 right; Borda 1946 pls. A top left, 9 second row left; Levi 1976, pl. 179 1). One example com- bines the style with Precision Stamped Ware of MM II B (Pernier 1935, pl. XXXb). 340 combines the de- fining motif of this style with the Wavy-line Style, also arguably MM II B. Two examples from Kommos should probably also be assigned to the MM II B period and not MM III A (Betancourt 1990, nos. 822, 1666).</page><page sequence="59">6o POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES ^^ ^^^^^v^h^^^^^h^f^^^^^b^h r^HTin"^vnivnvnvriHVTHn í^^^^^^h^^^^b^^^i^^^^i^^^^^h ^^^^^^^^^ BfBCTaiSfBBTii ■pjggpji^^g 2 3 ^^^^^P^^^^^^r^^^^^^r^^^^^^F^^^^^^r^^Ê ^ÊF^^^ÃF^^^bF^^^ÃE^F^ÊF^^^AF^^^^M ŒaŒ^^far^^&amp;Œ^^ftmB^Œn^^Sns^^sœ^^Snna lAlAfAfAfAV Ijfl^M^feHJ^fe^J^feHJ^fe^U^fe^l KM^MT^^Rf^7^B■^^^W.■|■^W^JW!v^^KT^ 4 S 6 ^^^^^Wmf W^^^^^^^^^r£''"m^^^m ^^I^V* ^^^Hlf^^^fnf ^^^^H ^ ^ftttr ^ttÈtr ^HÊmT ^^1 ^^^m M m ^^^^^^^^J m':-''m ^^^^^^ ^I^M' .^ ^.^^^^Ha* .^^^^^1 ^^^r ^EÉim ^ÊSÈlm ^Mmtlm ^^^^M ^^m M[ ^ ^r : '^r ^^^^^^^^H ^^ËT ^^^^^^^^^r .^^^^^^^tEr .^^^^^^^^1 ^^r ^El^^M ^B^W^r ^Kt^Ç^r ^^^^^^^Ê ^m f ^f ^^^^^^^^^^^f ^^■'•':'Éf ^^^^^^^^^M ^^f ^^^^^^^^^P ^^^^^^^^^P .^^^^^^^^^1 ^r ^^D^^&amp; .^^CkH^r ^^B^^m ^^^^^^^1 7 5 9 /0 // /2 ■ 'M^pj^^K; V^^^^^l- Ibi^^^^|: I ^^^^^ ^b ^^^1 - ^^A ^v ^^Klt-' i I ^^^^^jj^^^^H ^^^^^j^^^^H I ^J ^ /5 ^^^^^^^^r^P^^^H^ -^^^^^^^^rJ^^^^I^V-lïl ^^^^^HHIfT^ Afilli Uy^^^^^^myfl^ 4mTTTlÉ^^^^B ^^.^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^r ^^^k^^^^r ^1 /6 /7 /5 K^^rj| |p^^ai| |m=Si 79 20 2/ 22 2J 2^ /"í¿. 2./.

Fine Buff Fabric cup K.i 010. Starburst Style. A small number of Straight-sided Cups of types 8 and 10 are decorated with a white-painted star or rosette as the central motif on two sides, with swirls and loops as frames. Examples are in Groups E (274-7, 338) and N (996) both containing material of the MM II B and MM III A periods. The earlier of the two dates may be indicated by the frequency of very similar types in a closely related style from Phaistos period 3 (F. 610, 700, 1040, 4076, 4941, 5083, 5541; Pernier 1935, 267 fig. 150 right, 381 fig. 228.2), and Kommos (Betancourt 1990, no. 1328). Betancourt illustrates the motif as typical of MM II B (1985 a, fig. 70 0). The Type 5 Bridge-spouted Jar from Abydos is deco- rated in a similar manner (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 1 18-19 fig. 38 pl. 13), though the disc at the centre of the main motif is red, unlike those in the Starburst Style. Red discs at the centre of star or rosette motifs are found on a MM II A jar (956) where, however, the motif stands alone. The Abydos jar, then, could be placed somewhere after the end of the MM II A period and before the end of MM II B. It probably comes from the same work- shop as K.1010, in FIG. 2.4. Unfortunately, K.1010 is not from a secure context (KSM box 18 13) and so is not included in the inventory here. Wavy-line Style. A highly distinctive and common style in the late groups is characterized by covering the body of Rounded Cups of Type 6 with either wavy-lines or scale patterns in white paint, and filling the interstices with white or polychrome patterns, often repeated in diagonal lines; a selection showing the variety of patterns is in FIG. 2.5. In most cases, the base of the cup is decorated with elaborate, dynamic polychrome patterns on the bottom and inside of the base, see PLATES 13, 74-5. In some ways, this style could be considered a successor to the Woven Style, as the patterns here could well be seen to reflect woven designs with tiny beads stitched-on in a variety of regular patterns. This style is quite common at Knossos with a number of examples from Group E (340-68) and N (998-9), and others in the AM (AE 826; 832.2; 968.2, 4; 1938.568)</page><page sequence="62">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 63 and BM (A 529). The contexts allow for dates in either the MM II B or MM HI A period at Knossos. A strong argument for the earlier date may be put forward on the basis of very similar cups in this style from Phaistos period 3 (E 527, 1430 Pernier 1935, pl. XXIa; Levi 1976, pl. 124 c, e, f, h), Kommos (Betancourt 1990, no. 517), and the primary destruction deposit at Anemospilia assigned by the excavators to the MM II B period (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1991, 144 fig. 120; Warren and Hankey 1989, 47-52; MacGillivray 1995). Exported examples at Phylakopi (Papagianopoulou 1991, nos. 346, 359, 361), Kea (Overbeck 1989, 182 pl. 85 DG. 16), Ugarit (Schaeffer 1949, 256 fig. 109 A) and Tell el-Dab'a (Walberg 1991; MacGillivray 1995) tes- tify to the popularity of this distinctive Knossian style overseas. A second cup from Ugarit has some of the / 2 3 4 5 6 Fig. 2.5. Selection of designs in the Wavy-line Style on Rounded Cups of Type 6: (i) 343; (2) 344; (3) 352; (4) 353! (5) 355!

XXXVIII bottom); but the main motif, while constructed above and below an undulating line, incor- porates an ivy pattern not seen in Crete until the LM I A period (Bernini 1995, 64 fig. 8E). One wonders if the cup could not have been painted over, at a time sev- eral generations subsequent to its manufacture. A bridge-spouted jar decorated in a wavy-line pat- tern, quite closely related to that on cup 356, was found with the MBA group in a tomb at Byblos (Baramki 1973, pl. IV.i). The group does not provide a firm chrono- logical link, but the form of the jar, with slightly raised and flattened rim and elongated foot, resembles that of 1002 and so helps to confirm the rounded bridge- spouted jar typology outlined below. An early version of the style may be seen in cup 642, with simple scale pattern but lacking decoration on the base. A type of squat rounded cup, found in later de- posits at Phaistos (F. 6018; Pernier 1935, 372 fig. 223; Borda 1946, pl. X. 3, 5), Kommos (Betancourt 1990, nos. 790, 171 5) and Palaikastro (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 16 fig. 10) painted with similar wavy-line designs with simplified motifs and in white only, may be a re- lated style of the MM HI A period. An example from Kastelli in Chania may be a W Cretan version of the early MM III style (Hallager and Tzedakis 1988, 20 fig. 6). It is possible to identify a further successor in the Finicky Style of the MM III B period, examples of which are found in the North- West Pit (PLATE 53), in a deposit near the North House on the Royal Road (War- ren 1 99 1, 330 fig. 10 C, M) and at Palaikastro (MacGillivray, Sackett et al. 1991, 138 fig. 14 centre right). Spiral Band Style. One of the dominant styles on the decorated pottery in Group E is defined by the sub- division of the surface into horizontal zones, and the use of either a spiky foliate band or interlocking S-spirals running essentially unbroken around the vase. Forms are a small bowl (306), Straight-sided Cups of types 5- 10 (309-31, 333, 997), a Rounded Cup of Type 5 (372), Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of type 5 (379-84), a Baggy-shaped Bridge-spouted Jar (390), and a large bowl (400). Very closely related styles are found in Fine Soft Buff and Tempered Buff Fabrics. The Group E context for the majority of the exam- ples allows for a likely range of dates from the MM II B to MM III A periods at Knossos. The earlier date, which is the one suggested by Evans for the large jars 876-8 in a closely related style (1 921, 251), is strongly sup- ported by the frequency of examples in the destruction deposits of Phaistos period 3 (F. 305, 525, 782, 804, 806- 7, !359&gt; 2585, 3059, 6144, 6150; Pernier 1935, 390 fig. 237). Further support may be the use of the spiky foli- ate band on Precision Stamped Ware Cup 433. It is likely that the frequent occurrence of the main motifs in the destruction deposits of Phaistos Period 3 led Betancourt to assign them to the MM II B period (1985 a, 97 fig. 70 K, AG). An earlier, MM II A period, inspiration for the spiky foliate band may be seen in the elaborate bands at the centre of bridge-spouted jars (930-41). There is little evidence for the use of the continuous running band of interlocking S-spirals on pottery prior to its adoption, in MM II B, on two jars from the main Trial KV de- posit (Popham 1974, pl. 30e, 32a). Its use as the only decoration on 157 may be its first appearance at Knossos. It becomes quite common only during MM II B when employed for this style. Variations in the in- terlocking spiral may be seen in the Heavy Spiral Style of MM II B and MM HI A; during MM IH B it be- comes one of the dominant decorative patterns and is enlarged to exaggerated proportions (e.g. Warren 1991, fig. 6B). A link between this style and wall-painting may be indicated by a fragment of painted plaster dado from the Loom weight Basement, with a possible row of cres- cents like those on 326, and jars 876-8 (Evans 1921, 251 fig. 118b). Heavy Spiral Style. A relatively rare but important style, it is distinguished by a heavy or 'weighted' spiral design, created by either thickening the outermost line or Tilling the angle' (Walberg 1992, 93) between the spirals. Within this style, an important distinction may be made between those composed of open running spirals (332, 334), and those with closed spirals resembling crashing waves (240-1, 311). The examples are straight-sided and rounded cups in Groups D and E and, thus, could be either MM II B or MM HI A. The style seems to originate in the MM II B period at Phaistos, where heavy open running spirals are com- bined with precision stamps on a bridge-spouted jar from a destruction deposit (Pernier 1935, pl. XXXV). Another jug from Phaistos combines heavy open run- ning spirals on the body with pendant closed spirals on the shoulder, suggesting that closed spirals first appear at the very end of the MM II B period (Pernier 1935, 295 fig. 172). This is confirmed by a jug with closed heavy spirals from the primary destruction deposit at Anemospilia (J. andE. Sakellarakis 1979, pl. 183; 199 1, fig. 120). Closed heavy spirals continue to appear in the early stages of MM III on cups from Deposit B of the Acropo- lis Houses at Knossos (Catling et al. 1979, 28 fig. 18 V 91-2) and from early neopalatial deposits at Phaistos (F. 354, 387; Borda 1946, 21 pl. XI 77437) and rounded bridge-spouted jars very much like Knossos type 6 at Phaistos (Pernier 1935, pl. XIX a, b). White-spotted Style. This study uses the term 'White- spotted', as employed by Evans (1 921, 417), to describe a style characterized by the use of consistent white spots</page><page sequence="64">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 65 on a dark ground, likened by Mackenzie to 'snow flake dots' (190 1 PB, 51), applied with the tip of a fine brush so that there is rarely an overlap or running downward of the thick white paint. These may have been applied individually, as on 426, or carefully sprayed as on 404- 7. Obviously, this definition can be problematic as sprayed, dabbed or otherwise applied white spots are found on pottery in many periods (Warren and Hankey 1989, 57). However, with caution and careful observation it is possible to distinguish those examples that Evans referred to and present a brief analysis. This style is found on a Tumbler of Type 4 (989), Straight-sided Cups of Types 7 (990), 8 (300-5), 12 (404-7, 423-6, 1044), and 13 (403), Rounded Cups of Types 5 (419-20, 1045), and 7 (413-16), Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 3 (409-10, 412, 991-2), and a Jug with Horizontal Spout of Type 3 (1042). Its fre- quency in Group E (299-305, 403-7, 409-16, 419-20, 423-6, 428-9) and occurrence in Groups K (818), N (989-93) and P (1042, 1044-5) on late ceramic types, taken with its appearance in Deposits A and B at the Knossos Acropolis Houses (Catling et al 1979, V. 49, 95-8) and in the group from an early excavation W of the palace (Hogarth and Welch 1 901, 80 figs. 7-9, 12, 18-19), place this style largely in the MM IH A period, as proposed by Evans (1921, 417). However, the exam- ples from Group K and the Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 3 indicate that the style came into exist- ence before the end of the MM II B period. Rare in the Mesara (Betancourt 1990, no. 1796), ex- amples were exported to Thera and Melos (Papagianopoulou 1991, nos. 278, 332). Earlier pottery decorated with large white dots, (e.g. 630, 641) or carelessly sprayed with white paint (e.g. 686) are also distinct, but not sufficiently numerous to justify their being treated as a style. A possible survival into MM HI B may be seen on three cups from Poros (Muhly 1992, nos. 35-7). it. A Formal Typology of the Fine Buff Pottery A recent attempt at a typology of MM pottery (Walberg 1976) is based on variations in form and is practically useless to the archaeologist; for this reason no refer- ence will be made to those types in this study. It is thought here to be more important to consider the func- tion of a vase, rather than its overall form. Whether it was meant to pour liquids is given more relevance than whether it had a conical-ovoid shape. It has been shown that the variations archaeologists frequently use to sepa- rate types of vases over centuries, can be accounted for in what time of day the pot was thrown. For example, a potter throwing rounded cups will begin with a freshly mixed batch of clay, and the earliest pots in the series will tend to sag and appear dumpy. As the clay dries out, the shape of the vase will become more firm and retain its intended shape (Van As 1984, 136). For this reason, the typology presented here pays little atten- tion to minor variations in the form of a vase, but con- centrates on similarities in production techniques, func- tion and overall shape. The following analysis applies primarily to the Fine Buff pottery of Knossos, although frequent reference is made to similar and related types at Phaistos from sound stratigraphical contexts. The object is to try to isolate 'type-fossils', that is distinctive and easily rec- ognizable ceramic forms that occur most commonly in one archaeological period and can be used with the analyses of wares and styles to suggest relative dates for the Groups described in Chapter 1 . Shallow Bowl (FIG. 2.6) The shallow bowl is relatively rare, occurring in only two types, one handmade the other thrown on the wheel. Both have a similar profile with outsplayed sides, flat rim and base. Type 1 is handmade. The two examples in the catalogue (18 and 24) are 3.2 and 3.8 cm high; diameters are 9.4 and 16.0 cm at the rim and 5.0 cm at the base. One example is plain, the other monochrome coated. Both belong to Group A, which, taken with its occurrence in the Vat Room Deposit, suggests that this type may be assigned to the MM I B period at Knossos (Evans 1921 , 167 fig. 1 1 8a. 1 6; Momigliano 1991, 169, 173 fig. 4 pl. 24 no. 14). Similar bowls at Phaistos are most common in Period 1, contemporary with MM I B at Knossos (e.g. Levi 1976, pl. 36). However, the form originates in the EM II B pottery of Knossos and continues to be produced in EM HI and MM I A and so cannot be taken as characteristic of any single period (Momigliano 1991 , 252 Type 1). Type 2 is a fine, wheelmade variant of Type 1 with slightly larger dimensions. There are two examples in the catalogue (79 and 1 16). Both are monochrome coated and 116 is also polychrome decorated. Both examples Fig. 2.6. Fine Buff Shallow Bowl Types. TLT ^'XJT</page><page sequence="65">66 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES are in Group A and should be assigned to the MM I B period, though the sample is hardly enough to define the type as diagnostic. A common later variation of this type may be the Crude Bowl of Type 2 which begins in the MM II A period (see below p. 82). Small Rounded Bowl with Tripod Feet There are two examples of small, rounded, handmade bowls with a part of the rim pulled out to form a spout, two lugs on the rim and three bosses on the rounded underside that act as pods: 25 and 49. Both examples are 4.5 cm high with diameters of 6.0 cm at the rim and 3.5 cm at the base. Both are monochrome coated and 49 is polychrome decorated. Both belong to Group A, and should be regarded as MM I B. A possible later form of this type may be seen in a small spouted bowl with tripod feet of the MM II B period from the pit in Chamber Tomb XVII at Mavrospilio (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 no. 27). Rounded Goblet (FIG. 2.7) A common form in the early deposits of the Old Palace is the Rounded Goblet, or 'Egg-cup', which occurs in three types. Type 1 is handmade. It is formed by shaving or 'paring' the lower side and then attaching a rough strip of clay to form the base. The sixteen examples in the catalogue (1-7, 15, 16, 671 and 892-7) are 6.0-7.0 cm high with diameters of 8.0 cm at the rim and 4.5 cm at the base. Eight examples have plain surfaces, five are dark-on- buff painted and three are monochrome coated. The type's frequency in Group A, and its use in Pared Ware suggest that it was in use during the MM I B period. This date is supported by an example from the Vat Room Deposit (Evans 1921, 167 fig. n8a.io; Momigliano 1991, 172 no. 1). The examples from Groups G and L could represent continued produc- tion in the MM II A period, or in the case of Group G could have come from an earlier, MM I B, floor. How- ever, given the origins of Pared Ware in the MM I A period, we must allow for the possibility of an earlier date for this type as well (Momigliano 1991, 264). A related form, though lacking a foot, may be seen in some of the Period 1 'skutelia' from Phaistos (Fiandra 1973, 86-8 pl. 21; Levi 1976, pl. 35; Levi and Carinci 1988, pl. 99). Type 2 has a wheelmade upper body attached to a hand- made base. There are six examples in the catalogue (no, 162-3, 682 and 918-19, with heights of 7.4-7.8 cm, and diameters of 7.5-9.0 cm at the rim and 4.5-5.0 cm at the base. All the examples are monochrome coated on the upper part and have a distinctive thick white horizontal band added below the rim. The foot is plain but has drips of paint from the coating of the upper part. This type occurs in Groups A, B, G and L, which suggests that it spans both the MM I B and MM II A periods. Other examples are from the MM II A deposit in Early West Magazine 2 (Brown 1983, 68-9 figs. 36b, c). Type 2 may be the successor to the EM III and MM I A footed goblet of Type 4 (Momigliano 1991, 247-8 n.285). It seems likely that it is the prototype for the Crude Goblet that becomes quite common during the MM II A period, see below p. 83. Type j is the fine wheelmade variant of Types 1 and 2. None of the four examples in the catalogue (in, 226, 925 and 976) is complete, but the average dimensions of this type are likely to be 10.0-1 1 .0 cm in height and diameters of 1 0.0-12.0 cm at the rim and 4.0-5.0 cm at the base. One example is monochrome coated and deco- rated in the White Banded Style, the others are in Pat- tern Painted Ware. There are also other decorated ex- amples in the AM. The presence of two of the exam- ples in Groups A and L and the use of this type in barbotine, 226, and Early Printed Ware, 976, indicate that the type begins in the MM I B period and likely continues into the MM II A period. Two examples from Phaistos were found in what appear to be deposits of Period 2; one was below the floor in Vano CVH (F. 6506), the other below the floor in Room Gamma of Chalara South (F. 4378). Fig. 2.J. Fine Buff Rounded Goblet Types. w W M7</page><page sequence="66">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 67 The immediate predecessor for this type may be seen in goblets from House B beneath the West Court (Momigliano 1990, 483 fig. 1-4; 1991, pl. 54 no. 12) and the earliest floor beneath the Monolithic Pillar Base- ment (Mackenzie 1906, pl. 7 nos. 15 and 16), which may on stylistic grounds be assigned to late in the MM I A period. There is no comparable form from the later deposits at Knossos or elsewhere. The Rounded Goblet is one of the characteristic forms found in the MM I B and MM II A deposits at Knossos. Hood (197 1 ay 38 fig. 14) convincingly traces the devel- opment of the Minoan goblet from the EM I period; re-stated in detail by Momigliano (1990). The imme- diate predecessors of the goblets discussed here are the handmade dark-coated footed goblets of EM III and MM I A (Andreou 1978, 34-5; Momigliano 1991, 245- 8 ). The example Hood uses to illustrate MM I B gob- lets is very similar to our Type 2 and thus could also be used to represent the form in MM II A. Conical Goblet (FIG. 2.8) Three types of goblet with conical profile of the body and pronounced outsplayed foot appear alongside the Rounded Goblets of the early stages of the Old Palace period. Type 1 is handmade, but very fine. There are three ex- amples in the catalogue (609, 610 and 899). The aver- age height is 6.0 cm, and diameters are 6.0 cm at the rim and 5.0 cm at the base. All three are monochrome coated and decorated in the Diagonal Red and White Style. Similar goblets are known from the Vat Room Deposit (Evans 1921, 167 figs. u8a.7, 120; Momigliano 1 99 1 , 172 pl. 23 no. 4), the Early Floor beneath the Room of the Stone Pier, PLATE 141, and there is an unpub- lished example from Knossos in the AM (1909.327). All are so similar that they must be the products of the same workshop. The examples in the catalogue belong to Groups F and L, which are primarily MM II A Groups with some earlier material. Given the relation- ship of this type to the following and the decoration on both, it would seem most sensible to place its manufac- ture in the MM I B period. A single conical goblet from Phaistos, decorated in rough barbotine, appears to be contemporary (F. 3014). Type 2 is handmade and may be regarded as a large variant of Type 1 . The lone example in the catalogue (55) is c. 21.0 cm high with diameters of 9.5 cm at the rim and 10.0 cm at the base. It is monochrome coated and decorated in the Diagonal Red and White Style like Type 1, and may come from the same workshop. It belongs to Group A and may be assigned to the MM I B period. The relative date may be confirmed by the discovery of a very fine goblet, probably of this type but decorated in horizontal zones, in the burnt MM I B deposit from the South- West Palace Angle (Catling 1988, 68 - erroneously reported as MM II A egg-shell ware). Two stone goblets with very similar profile, from Ayia Triada, are assigned to the MM IH-LM I periods, but should perhaps now be regarded as survivors from MM I B (Warren 1969, 97-8). Type 3 is wheelmade and quite fine. The three exam- ples in the catalogue (227, 651 and 652) are monochrome coated, with polychrome decoration. Although no com- plete example survives, the average height may be esti- mated at 1 1. o and 12.0 cm, and rim diameters are 9.0 cm. The presence of two examples in Group F suggest a date within the MM II A period for this type. The Conical Goblet may be taken as a 'type fossil' of the early stages of the Old Palace period, as it has no obvious immediate predecessors or successors. Fig. 2.8. Fine Buff Conical Goblet Types. ^If</page><page sequence="67">68 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES Momigliano suggests an origin for this type in the footed goblets of type 3 in the EM III pottery of Knossos (1991, 247), but the profile and foot construction are so dis- tinct on the MM I B and MM II A examples, that the two types need not be related. Tumbler (FIG. 2.9) A common form in the deposits of the Old Palace pe- riod is the simple straight-sided tumbler, which occurs in four types. Type 1 is handmade, occasionally with traces of shav- ing or paring on the lower exterior. The eight examples in the catalogue (17, 52, 53, 175-7, 673 and 898) are 3.0-7.0 cm high, with diameters of 4.0-8.0 cm at the rim and 2.0-3.5 cm at the base. Examples are dark-on- buff decorated, monochrome coated and monochrome coated with white and polychrome decoration. This type may represent the continuation of the foot- less goblet of Type 1 of the EM III and MM I A pottery of Knossos (Momigliano 1 991, 248 n.288). Its frequency in Group A, the use of the same reversed-3 motif on 53 and a jug from Period 1 at Phaistos (F. 2169), and the presence of an example in the Building 6/Tholos B deposit at Phourni (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1972, pl. 2 a) may indicate that this type was manufactured in MM I B; the isolated examples from Groups G and L being either survivors in MM II A contexts, or indicators of one or more MM I B floors in the Royal Pottery Stores. There are also three small examples from the deposit below the Room of the Stone Pier, but it is difficult to be certain of their fabric, as a very similar form occurs in Fine Red Fabric. Type 2 is handmade and may be taken as the large vari- ant of Type 1 . There is a single example in the cata- logue (54), which is incomplete but may have stood as high as 12.0 cm with a rim diameter of 8.0 cm. The surface is monochrome coated, with polychrome deco- ration. Its occurrence in Group A and its relation to Type 1 suggest that it should be assigned to the MM I B period. Type 3 is the wheelmade version and likely successor to Type 1 . The seven examples in the catalogue (225, 633- 5, 650, 807 and 817) are 3.6-6.6 cm in height, with di- ameters 5.0-6.0 cm at the rim and 2.2-2.8 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated, with white or poly- chrome decoration. Evans assigned 807 to the MM I B period (1935, 98), but the presence of examples in Groups F and J may indicate a date within the MM II A period. This may also be the date for a similar ex- ample from Phaistos, although it comes from a mixed context (F. 4934). Type 4 seems to be the wheelmade successor to Type 2 and the large equivalent for Type 3. The three exam- ples in the catalogue (169, 308, and 989) are 1 1. 0-12.0 cm high, with diameters of 1 1 .5 cm at the rim and 4.0- 5.0 cm at the base. One example is decorated in the Polychrome Reserved Style. The others are mono- chrome coated, with white or polychrome decoration. The example from Group C is MM II A in date. 308 and 989 are from mixed contexts, which contain pot- tery of the MM II A period, but include later material and could represent the continuation of this type into MMIIB. The tumbler has a long history starting in the EM pe- riod (Warren 1972, fig. 53 P223-4). More common in Middle Minoan E Crete, where it was richly decorated (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, pls. I Va, e, X k-m; Betancourt 1983, fig. 19 no. 254; Walberg 1983, 8 form 38, 184 no. 203; MacGillivray, Sackett et al. 1992, 133 fig. 1 1. 1-3; Stürmer 1993, no. 174), the form was sim- ple enough to be copied by Knossian potters, although infrequently. The form also occurs in stone (Hankey 1980, pl. 76). A later development of Type 4 may be recognized in the 'chalice' form of the neopalatial pe- riod, well illustrated by MM HI B examples from Palaikastro (MacGillivray et al. 1991, 135 fig. 12. 6-7). Straight-sided Cup (FIG. 2.10) The straight-sided, cylindrical or 'Vapheio' cup, most often with one vertical handle, is the most common Fig. 2.9. Fine Buff Tumbler Types. w W w¥</page><page sequence="68">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 69 product of the central Cretan potters to be found in levels of the Old Palace period at Knossos. Among the numerous examples from Knossos, thirteen types may be distinguished on the basis of technological criteria and dimensions. Type 1 is 'proto-wheelmade' with a strap handle and, in some cases, finished by shaving or paring the lower side. The eight examples in the catalogue (8-14 and 900) are 4.5-6.0 cm high, with diameters of 9.0-10.0 cm at the rim and 5.5-6.0 cm at the base. Seven exam- ples are plain and one is smeared with dark paint. The frequency of this type in Group A suggests that it be- longs to the MM I B period; confirmed by its frequency in the burnt deposit at the SW Palace Angle (Catling 1988, 68). Therefore, the single example in Group L should be regarded as a survivor in a MM II A context. Type 2 is 'proto-wheelmade', with a slightly convex base and strap handle. There are forty-nine examples in the catalogue (20, 26-30, 37-41, 56-67, 153, 155-6, 173-4, 178-88, 611, 612, 674-5, 789, 790, 797, 1022-4 and 1026-7) and numerous others are known from Knossos. Examples are 3.05 cm high, with diameters of 5.0-9.6 cm at the rim and 4.0-7.0 cm at the base. They are buff-reserved decorated, monochrome coated, and monochrome coated, with white or polychrome deco- ration. The decoration is quite varied: it may consist of simple vertical or diagonal lines, wavy bands, or dot rosettes and floral motifs all in the Woven Style, a se- lection of which is given in FIG. 2.1. The fact that this type is proto-wheelmade, decorated in the Woven Style and found in great numbers in Groups A, I and O, strongly suggests that its period of manufacture was in MM I B. The examples in Groups B, F, G and J may indicate its continued production into the MM II A period. Cups of this type have been found in the West Court (Momigliano 1991, 210 fig. 19 pl. 54 no. 123), the North- ern Quarter of the City (ibid., 181, 184 fig. 6), the 'MM I Oikia' (ibid., 239-40 pl. 57 no. 1) and in Hogarth's Early Heap in the town of Knossos (Hogarth and Welch 1901, pl. Vila, b). There were also examples from the rock-cut basement, to the N of a neopalatial house on Gypsades Hill, assigned to the MM I B period (Hood 1959, 19 fig. 29). Elsewhere in central Crete similar cups are found at Phourni (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1972, pl. 5a) and Gournes (Zois 1969, pls. 27, 28a). The type is rare in the Mesara, there being only one example from Megaloi Skinoi (Vasilakis 1990, 44 fig. 14e) and one similar form, though in Barbotine Ware, from a period 1 context at Phaistos (E 362). An example from Palaikastro had been assigned to the MM I A period (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, pl. IV g), and used to suggest an overlap between E Cretan MM I A and the early stages of the Old Pal- aces in Central Crete (Warren 1980, 491-2; Cadogan 1983, 513), but should now be regarded as belonging to the MM I B or MM II A period at Palaikastro (MacGillivray and Driessen 1990, 399 n. 26). Exam- ples from the Cyclades testify to Knossian products travelling far afield at this time (Papagianopoulou 1991 , cat. 337-8). Type j is 'proto-wheelmade' and serves as the large ver- sion of Type 2. The four examples in the catalogue (68, 189-91) are 6.5-9.0 cm in height, the diameters are 14.0-15.0 cm at the rim and 10. 5-12. o cm at the base. All are monochrome coated, with polychrome decora- tion in the Woven Style, of which a selection is given in FIG. 2.2, resembling those on Type 2 straight-sided cups. The similarity with Type 2 cups and the occurrence of one example in Group A suggest that this type belongs in the MM I B period. Type 4 is fine and wheelmade, with a sharp edge at the base and lower side and no handle. The eight examples in the catalogue (80-6, 228) are 4.5-6.0 cm in height, diameters are 9.0-10.0 cm at the rim and 4.0-5.0 cm at the base. Seven examples are monochrome coated, one is monochrome coated, with polychrome decoration. The frequency of this type in Group A, and its ab- sence in later groups, firmly place it in the MM I B period. Type 5 is wheelmade and similar to Type 4, but has a strap handle added at the rim and lower side. The twelve examples in the catalogue (87, 112, 117, 269, 270, 281- 2, 310-13, 653) are 5.0-7.0 cm in height, diameters are 8.5-12.0 cm at the rim and 5.5-1 1.0 cm at the base. One example is monochrome coated, the others are monochrome coated, with white or polychrome deco- ration. The occurrence of this type in Groups A, E, and F does not allow for a precise date, but indicates that the type came into being in the MM I B period and seems to have persisted without change throughout the Old Palace period. Type 6 is wheelmade and the tall version of Type 5, having a similar strap handle attached at the rim and middle of the side. The 26 examples in the catalogue (88, 113, 118, 119, 229, 230, 263-6, 271-2, 278, 314, 318, 624-30, 636, 638-9, and 654) are 6.0-10.0 cm high, diameters are 8.0-13.0 cm at the rim and 5.0-7.0 cm at the base. Examples are dark-on-buff decorated, mono- chrome coated, and monochrome coated, with white or polychrome decoration. The occurrence of this type in Groups A, E and F, as with Type 5, allows for a long history beginning in the MM I B period to be suggested. Type 7 is wheelmade with a slightly rounded profile at the base and lower side and strap handle attached at the rim and lower side. The ten examples in the catalogue (274. 3&lt;&gt;3-5&gt; 323, 3^9, 433, 990, 994&gt; 1043) are 55-70 cm in height, diameters are 8.0-10.5 cm at the rim and 5-5-7-5 cm at the base. Examples are monochrome</page><page sequence="69">70 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES Fig. 2.10. Fine Buff Straight-sided Cup Types.

As most examples are from the mixed contexts of Groups E and N, the chronological position of this type could be MM II B or MM III A. Examples in the Starburst Style, (274) and the Spiral Band Style (323, 329) and its use by Precision Stamped Ware Cup (433), which also has a spiky foliate band, argue for its place in MM II B. The White-spotted Style decoration on 990 may be in- terpreted two ways: it could be used to argue for the continuation of this type into the MM III A period, though there are no examples among the cups from the early deposits at the Knossos Acropolis Houses, or to suggest that the White-spotted Style originated in the MM II B period. Type 8 is wheelmade and a tall counterpart for Type 7, having a slightly rounded profile at the base and strap handle at the rim and middle of the side. The seven examples in the catalogue (275, 279, 300-2, 333, 408) are 7.5-10.0 cm in height, diameters are 1 0.0-12.0 cm</page><page sequence="70">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 71 at the rim and 5.0-7.0 cm at the base. One example is monochrome coated, the remainder are monochrome coated and white decorated. All are in Group E and thus from a mixed context. However, many examples are decorated in styles that belong in the MM II B pe- riod: 275 is in Starburst Style, 333 is in the Spiral Band Style and 408 is in Precision Grooved Ware. Similar cups from Phaistos appear to come from Period 3 con- texts and thus are contemporary (F. 1426, 1445, 1719, 191 1, 2301a). 300-2 are in the White-spotted Style and can be compared with cups in Deposit B of the Knossos Acropolis Houses, most likely an indication that this type continues into the MM IH A period (Catling et al. 1979, fig. 1 9 V. 53, 115). Type 9 is wheelmade with a strap handle attached at the rim and lower side, and has a distinctive bevelled profile at the base and lower side. The 1 1 examples in the catalogue (280, 284, 319-21, 326, 332, 335-7, and 1041) are 6.0-7.0 cm in height, diameters are 8.0-12.5 cm at the rim and 5.0-6.0 cm at the base. All examples are monochrome coated and white or polychrome deco- rated. Most examples come from the mixed context of Group E. 280, 284 and 336-7 are decorated in the Sun- rise Style most common at Phaistos on similar cup types in Period 2 (F. 441, 445, 801, 950a), but which may con- tinue into Period 3 (E 191 1). 319-21 are in the Spiral Band Style and most likely to be placed in the MM II B period. K. 1010 is in the Starburst Style of MM II B. 332 is in the Heavy Spiral style, which originates in MM II B but becomes popular in MM HI A. This type, then, seems to have been most popular during the MM II B period. It may have been intro- duced during MM II A at Phaistos, as an example from Vano 1 1 shows (F. 443). There are no such early exam- ples from Knossos, though the straight-sided cups, to accompany the Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 4, have not been found. An example from a well-strati- fied sequence of deposits at Palaikastro confirms that the type belongs to the later part of the Old Palace pe- riod in E Crete (MacGillivray et al. 1992, 136 fig. 13). Type 10 is wheelmade with bevelled base and is the tall version of Type 9. The twenty examples in the cata- logue (223, 273, 277, 293-98, 315-17, 322, 327-8, 331, 338-9, and 996-7) are 7.5-9.0 cm in height, diameters are 9.0-12.0 cm at the rim and 5.0-9.0 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated, with white or polychrome decoration. The numerous examples in Group E and the pair in Group N are from mixed contexts. How- ever, 223 and 293-8 are in Late Printed Ware, which is most likely a direct development from Early Printed Ware and should be placed early in the MM II B pe- riod. This type is frequently decorated in styles of the MM II B period, for example 277, 338 and 996 are in the Starburst Style, 315-17, 322, 327-8, 331, 997 are in the Spiral Band Style. It is also a common type in the destruction deposits of Period 3 at Phaistos (Levi and Carinci 1988, 205-1 1 pls. 88-9). The technique of tool- ing the base to create the bevel, however, may persist into the MM IH A period, as examples from the Knossos Acropolis Houses show (Catling et al. 1979, fig. 18 V. 97,19 V. 114,118-19). Type //is wheelmade with strap handle attached at the rim and lower side, and has horizontal grooves cut in the side creating ridges in the centre. The four exam- ples in the catalogue (423-6) are 5.8 cm high, diam- eters are 9.2-9.5 cm at the rim and the base is 7.8 cm. All are monochrome coated and polychrome decorated in a manner very similar to each other and probably come from the same workshop. The four examples are in the mixed context of Group E. However, its close relationship to Type 12 cups and its decoration in the White-spotted style indicate that it belongs near the close of MM II B or early in MM HI A. A possible example of this type from Phaistos, un- fortunately from a mixed deposit, would be the only instance of its occurrence outside of Knossos (Levi 1976, 477 fig- 730)- Type 12 is wheelmade with strap handle attached at the rim and middle of the side, and has a distinctive series of well-spaced horizontal grooves cut in the side at regu- lar intervals, creating ridges. The six examples in the catalogue (404-7, 1037, and 1044) are 5-7-7-3 cm high, diameters are 9.0-1 1 .5 cm at the rim and 5.6-8.0 at the base. All are monochrome coated with white or poly- chrome decoration. The type is very common in Group E, 404-7 represent only a fraction of the fragments from the context in the KSM, and to which might be added one in the AM (1938.458). 1044 in Group P, and the popularity of Ridged Ware and the White-spotted Style in the earliest deposits at the Knossos Acropolis Houses (Catling et al 1979, fig. 18 V. 49 and 95-8; fig. 49 shape 17), place this type in the MM HI A period. At least two examples, in a closed deposit near the Knossos North House, indicate that the type was first produced before the end of the MM II B period (Catling 1982, 53 fig. 116; Warren and Hankey 1989, 57). Some of the Group E examples, then, may be MM II B. A cup very similar to Type 12 was found at Gournia and placed by the excavator 'On the borderline between Middle Minoan and Late Minoan times' (Boyd-Hawes et al. 1908, 38 pl. VI.34). It is curious that this type does not occur in the Mesara - there is not a single example reported, yet the form is imported and imitated in E Crete and in Kea (Davis 1986, 81 pl. 28 U 79-82), Naxos (Barber and Hadjianastasiou 1989, 107 fig. 22 no. 420), Thera and Melos (Papagiannopoulou 1991, cat. no. 263, 340) in the Cyclades. The metallic inspiration for the form may be best understood by comparing a gold cup from Grave Cir- cle A at Mycenae with 407 (Hood 1978, 156 fig. 148 F; Matthäus 1980, pl. 75.9).</page><page sequence="71">72 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES Type 13 is distinguished by a rounded horizontal bulge at the middle. The single example in the catalogue (403) comes from the mixed context of Group E. Its decora- tion in the White-spotted Style allows for a MM II B or MM IH A date. However, its similarity to cups from a period 4 deposit in Vano LXXV at Phaistos (F. 3708) and from the Kamilari Tholos (F. 3202), which pro- duced material of numerous periods including early MM III, make it most likely that the type was intro- duced in MM III A. It is the obvious predecessor to the MM III B and LM I A 'Vapheio cup' with ripple decoration (e.g. Popham 1977, 193 fig. iB; 1984, pls. 128a, 142 nos. 12- 14; Catling et al. 1979, 41 fig. 27 V.186; Warren 1991a, fig. 9 K and L; Levi 1976, pl. 2i2r). Convex-sided Cup There are two examples of handmade cups with slightly convex profile, flat base and strap handle rising above the rim, 42 and 69. They are 5.5 cm high, and diam- eters are 7.5 cm at the rim and 5.0 cm at the base. Both are monochrome coated and white or polychrome deco- rated, 69 with a pattern reminiscent of the Polychrome Geometric Style of late MM I A and 42 with a single closed spiral very similar to that on jug 48. Both are in the late MM I B context of Group A, but may have been manufactured in the earlier stages of the period as sug- gested by examples from the Vat Room Deposit (Evans 1921, 167 fig. u8a.2o; Momigliano 1991, 169, 173 fig. 4 no. 9), the Building 6/Tholos B deposit at Phourni (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1972, pls. D, Ea; 1991, 101 fig. 74), and Gournes (Zois 1969, pls. 27, 34). The form is relatively unknown in S central Crete, there being only one example from the tomb at Tis Chatzinas to Liophyto, which contained pottery from the EM II to MM I B periods (Vasilakis 1990, 64-5 pl. 13b). Tall-rimmed Angular Cup (FIG. 2.1 1) Cups with high outsplayed rim and side, above a carination or angle near the base, are a feature of the earlier stages of the Old Palace at Knossos. Six types may be distinguished. Type 1 is handmade and may be regarded as an angular companion to the Straight-sided Cup of Type 2. Sub-class 1 a has a flat base; ib has a foot. The eight examples of Type ia in the catalogue (31-4, 43, 172, 192, 613) are 4.0-5.0 cm high, diameters are 6.0-8.0 cm at the rim and 2.5-5.0 cm at the base. Examples are buff-reserved, monochrome coated and monochrome coated, with white or polychrome decoration. A re- served-painted example was found by Hogarth (Hogarth and Welch 1 901, 90 fig. 20). The three examples of Type ib in the catalogue (70, 788, 795) are 4.5-6.2 cm high, diameters are 9.0 at the rim and 3.0-4.0 cm at the base. They are monochrome coated, and 70 has polychrome decoration and a pulled out spout at the rim. An example with two handles, from Hogarth's Early Heap in the town of Knossos, shows another variation of this type (Hogarth and Welch 1 901, 91 fig. 21). Type 1 cups are found in Groups A, F, I and J and would appear to belong to both the MM I B and MM II A periods, although the examples in Groups F and J could well be survivors. Examples from Phourni Q. and E. Sakellarakis 1972, pl. 5b) and Gournes (Zois 1969, pl. 28) most likely be- long to the early stages of MM I B, while a very similar type from Phaistos comes from a Period 2, or MM II A, context (F. 3247). Type 2 is handmade and is the large version of Type 1 . There are four examples in the catalogue (19, 71-2, 1025), of which only the last is complete with foot, simi- lar to that on Type ib, perhaps indicating that this type needed such a support at the base. The average height is 7.0 cm, diameters are 11. 0-13. o cm at the rim and are 6.0 cm at the base. Examples are dark-on-buff, monochrome coated, and monochrome coated, with polychrome decoration. The occurrence of examples in Groups A and O, and the decoration on 71-2 in the Diagonal Red and White Style, suggest a date in the MM I B period for this type. A complete, undecorated example was found in the early MM I B deposit at Phourni (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1991, 101 fig. 74). There are fragments of a very large version of the handmade tall-rimmed angular cup, in KSM #94 and HM 5738, but none could be restored to give an ad- equate profile. The fragments are decorated in a man- ner very similar to the Straight-sided cups of Type 3, for which they are most likely angular counterparts. Type 3 is the wheelmade equivalent to Type 1 . The two types are similar in profile, but the lower side of Type 3 is more often concave instead of the straight or convex profile of Type 1 . The twelve examples in the catalogue (89-95, 114, 231-2, 756, and 1032 are 3.5-6.1 cm high, diameters are 7.0-8.5 cm at the rim and 2.4-5.0 cm at the base. Examples are in Shallow Grooved Ware and monochrome coated, and monochrome coated, with white or polychrome decoration; 1032 has a crinkled rim. The form's occurrence in Groups A and O sug- gests that it belongs in the MM I B period. The exam- ple in Group H may be a survivor. An example from a group of sherds, used to date the construction of the Early Keep, was assigned by Branigan to the MM II period (1992, 160 fig. 2.5). However, it may now be ac- cepted to belong with the rest of the material it was found with, and indicate that the cutting, into which the Early Keep was built, took place in MM I B. There is an example in the early MM I B group at Gournes (Zois 1969, pls. 25-6), but similar cups at Phaistos seem to come from Period 2 contexts (e.g. F 186, 405, 424, 430, 434, 695, 1397 a,b, 4935a, 4944a; Fiandra 1980, pl. 43.2) contemporary with MM II A at Knossos.</page><page sequence="72">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 73 Type 4 is wheelmade, and distinguished by its very high upper side and rim as compared with the lower side. It has a strap handle probably rising above the rim and a flat base. The two examples in the catalogue (170 and 656) are 6.5 cm high, diameters are 9.0 cm at the rim and 3.5 cm at the base. Both are monochrome coated and polychrome decorated. The examples are in Groups C and F, and thus most likely belong in the MM II A period. The decoration on 170 is very similar to a rounded bridge-spouted jar like Type 4 from Phaistos (F. 426). Both pieces are probably contemporary and may even originate from the same workshop. Similar cups are most often found in deposits of Pe- riod 2 at Phaistos (e.g. E 398, 429, 435, 446, 447, 1427, 2297a, 2604, 4904, 5063, 5420) which complements the Knossos date and suggest a likely place of origin for 170 and 656 in the Mesara. Type 5 is wheelmade with a distinctive convex profile on the lower side. The two examples in the catalogue (907-8) are c. 6.5 cm high, diameters are 1 1.0 and 13.0 cm at the rim and 4.2 and 5.3 cm at the base. Both are monochrome coated and belong to Group L, which should allow for this type to be placed in the MM II A period. A similar type in E Crete seems to occur at the same time (MacGillivray et al. 1992, figs. 10.1, 12.2-3). Type 6 is a wheelmade counterpart to Type 2. It has an indented base, strap handle, attached at the rim and above the angle in the side, and a concave profile at the lower side. The two examples in the catalogue (657-8) are monochrome coated, with polychrome decoration. The examples belong to Group F, which indicates that this type belongs in the MM II A period at Knossos. Examples of this type at Phaistos appear to belong in Period 2 (e.g. F. 277, 399, 420, 436, 974, 1996, 3423, 5410; Fiandra 1980, pl. 38. 1-4), which conforms with the Knossos date for the type, and again suggests a likely origin for 657-8 in the Mesara, where their decoration would be more at home than at Knossos. The Tall-rimmed Angular Cup belongs to the groups of the MM I B and MM II A periods at Knossos. Types 1-3 seem to belong, for the most part, in MM I B, while Types 4-6 belong to the MM II A period. There are no examples in the later groups, so the type may not have survived the MM II A destruction in the palace. A simi- lar situation may be observed at Phaistos, though largely obscured by Levi's publication of the finds from the SW Block of the palace. The situation may be rem- edied by re-establishing the primary deposits using Fiandra's definitions of the periods (see below, pp. 99- 102). Short-rimmed Angular Cup (FIG. 2.12) Cups, with angular profile and a short outsplayed rim above a high lower side, are found in three types. Type 1 is wheelmade with a strap handle attached at the rim and angle and has a simple foot. The three ex- amples in the catalogue (98, 759 and 804) are 3.7-5.3 Fig. 2.11. Fine Buff Tall-rimmed Angular Cup Types.</page><page sequence="73">74 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES cm high, diameters are 7.2-10.0 cm at the rim and 3.0- 4.5 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated and two are also decorated in white. The example in Group A shows that the type begins in the MM I B period. Those in H and J could indicate that the type continues into the MM II A period, or could be survivors. Type 2 is wheelmade with a strap handle attached at the rim and angle and a high foot. Two sub-types may be distinguished: 2a has a plain foot, 2b has a moulded foot. The twenty-four examples in the catalogue (99, 100, 101, 203-07, 677-81, 802-3, and 909-17) are 4.5- 8.0 cm high, diameters are 7.0-17.0 cm at the rim and 4.0-6.0 cm at the base. The five examples from Group D are buff-reserved decorated, the remainder are mono- chrome coated. The examples in Group A, and the fre- quent occurrence of this type in the burnt deposit at the SW Palace Angle (Catling 1974, 34; 1988, 68), indi- cate that this type begins in the MM I B period. The numerous examples in Groups G, J and L seem to show that it continued into the MM II A period, as does a related form at Phaistos (F. 187, 3520, 4358). Type 3 is wheelmade with a strap handle attached at the rim and below the slight angle, formed by tooling. The six examples in the catalogue (409-12, 991-2) are 8.5-10.0 cm high, diameters are 10.0-13.5 cm at the rim and 4.5-5.0 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated and most are also decorated in the White-Spot- ted Style. The occurrence of this type in Groups E and N does not allow for a firm date. However, the quality of the surface treatment and the fine tooling, to create the ridge below the rim, are quite similar to those on Straight-sided Cups of Type 12; they give the impres- sion of both types having been manufactured in the same workshop. The problems associated with dating the straight-sided cup are shared with this type, however, the mention of an example from a MM II deposit in the Stratigraphical Museum excavations (Catling 1982, 53), suggests that this type belongs in the MM II B pe- riod, contemporary with a closely related form in Pe- riod 3 at Phaistos (F. 534, 4687, 6054). A formal development may be traced in the short- rimmed angular cup. Type 1 is characteristic of MM 1 B. Type 2 spans the MM I B and MM II A periods. Type 3 represents the latest version of the form in MM II B, as there seems not to be a MM III A successor. It would be useful to try to place the Karmi Cup in this sequence (Stewart 1962, 202 fig. 8 pl. VHa-d). None of the Knossian examples has barbotine on the angle, but the barbotine on the Shallow Angular Bowls of Type 2 is very similar, and the decoration on the Karmi Cup is quite similar to that on the fine Type 2 cups from the Group D, e.g. on 203 and 21 1 . It would best fit, then, in either MM I B or MM II A and is unlikely to be later, or earlier. Squat Rounded Cup (FIG. 2.13) Two types of wheelmade cup with squat rounded pro- file are found in the early groups. Type 1 has a simple profile with slightly outsplayed rim, strap handle attached at the rim and lower side and flat base. The six examples in the catalogue (104-6, 12 1-2, 975) are 5.5-8.0 cm high, diameters are 6.5-9.5 cm at the rim and 2.5-5.0 cm at the base. Examples are buff- reserved decorated, monochrome coated and mono- chrome coated, with polychrome decoration. The five examples in Group A confirm that the type belongs in the MM I B period at Knossos. Two very similar examples from Phaistos were found with material of Period 2 under Vano CVH, and may show that the type continued to the end of the MM II A period there (F. 6448, 6485). There is a strong resemblance between this type and one of the cup forms in the 'Tod Treasure' (Bisson de la Roque et al. 1953, pls. XII 70580, XIII 70583), see below pp. 103-04. Type 2 is similar in profile to Type 1 but has a horizon- tal step or flange in the middle. The two examples in the catalogue (107 and 123) are 7.5 and 9.9 cm high, diameters are 7.5 and 8.3 cm at the rim and 4.5-5.5 cm Fig. 2.12.

Both are monochrome coated and 123 also has polychrome decoration. Both examples are in Group A, which shows that the type belongs in the MM I B period. Rounded Cup (FIG. 2. 14) The rounded, semi-globular or hemispherical one-han- dled cup enjoys a long history at Knossos and appears in six general types in the Old Palace period. Type 1 is handmade, with simple profile and a strap handle attached at the rim, rising above it and connect- ing in the middle of the side. There are two sub-classes. 1 a has a simple, flat base, ib has a slightly raised and moulded base. There are three examples of Type ia in the catalogue (22, 44 and 754, that are from 5.2-5.8 cm high, diameters are 8.5-9.0 cm at the rim and 4.0-5.0 cm at the base. They are buff reserved decorated, mono- chrome coated and monochrome coated, with white decoration. Type ib has two examples in the catalogue (45 and 902). They are 5.5 cm high, diameters are 8.0 and 8.3 at the rim and 4.5-5.2 cm at the base. One is dark-on-buff decorated, the other is monochrome coated, with white decoration. Hogarth found a third example of this sub-type in his Early Heap group in the town of Knossos (Hogarth and Welch 1 901, 91 fig. 23). The occurrence of this type in Group A would suggest that it belongs in the MM I B period, perhaps to the earlier part of the period, as suggested by the presence of an example in the Building 6/Tholos B group at Phourni (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1991, 101 fig. 74). However, it is almost indistinguishable from the One-handled Cups of Types 1 and 2 from EM HI and MM I A contexts at Knossos (Momigliano 1991, 249- 51). The examples in Groups H and L may be regarded as survivors from the MM I period, or the last in a long line that saw very little change. Type 2 is handmade, with offset rim, rounded bulge in the profile of the upper side, and a strap handle attached at the rim and widest part of the body. The only exam- ple in the catalogue is 35, which is monochrome coated and belongs to Group A, suggesting a date in MM I B for the type. This type is a direct descendant of the EM IH-MM I A One-handled Cup of Type 5 (ibid., 251) and may be a handmade equivalent to the more common Rounded- cup of Type 3. The form in stone is illustrated by a serpentine cup from the Patema ossuary at Palaikastro (Warren 1969, 40 P227). Type 3 is wheelmade and similar in profile to Type 2, but with a concave profile on the lower side and the base is usually indented. The 19 examples in the cata- logue (109, 125-6, 209, 221, 236, 618-23, 631, 643-6, 805 and 921) are 6.5-8.0 cm high, diameters are 8.0- 14.0 cm at the rim and 3.7-5.0 cm at the base. One example is buff reserved decorated, the others are mono- chrome coated, with white or polychrome decoration. Examples in Egg-shell Ware (618-23) and Early Printed Ware (631) and the occurrence of examples in Groups A, F, J and L indicate that the type spans the MM I B and MM II A periods, but does not continue into MM II B. This may also be the case at Phaistos, where the closest parallels for this type are from a Period 2 con- text in Room XCIV (F. 4817b, 5017, 542ia-d) Type 4 appears to be the wheelmade variant and possi- ble successor to Type 1, but with slightly out-turned rim. It is distinguished from Type 3 by the globular profile of the lower side. The 1 1 examples in the cata- logue (108, 210, 616-17, 642, 661, 799-801, 922, and 978) are 6.0-8.0 cm high, diameters are 8.8-12.5 cm a* the rim and 3.5-5.5 cm at the base. One example is buff reserved decorated, the others are monochrome coated and most examples have white or polychrome decora- tion. The frequency of examples in Groups A, F, J, L and M indicate that it belongs in both the MM I B and MM II A periods, with the finest examples, 799-801, occurring in Egg-shell ware. Type 5 is wheelmade and appears to be a development of Type 3, with a less pronounced base and lower side, but retaining the same offset rim and rounded bulge in the profile of the upper side. The 30 examples in the catalogue (237-8, 240-1, 285-6, 370-6, 417-21, 436- 44, 987 and 1039) are 5.0-8.0 cm high, diameters are 11.0-17.0 cm at the rim and 4.5-5.5 cm at the base. Examples are monochrome coated and monochrome coated, with white and polychrome decoration. The large number of examples attest to its popularity at Knossos. Most are from the mixed deposits of Groups D, E and N, but, as examples are in Precision Stamped</page><page sequence="75">76 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES Fig. 2.14. Fine Buff Rounded Cup Types. UJ 0? QJ Ware (237, 436-44), Precision Grooved Ware (987, 417- 21) and the Spiral Banded (372) and Heavy Banded (240-1) styles, the type can be assigned to the MM II B period, with the possibility of its continued use in the early stages of MM III A. Type 5, then, may be the MM II B successor to Type 3. The striking similarity between 369-70 and cups from the final MM II B destruction in Vano VIH at Phaistos (Pernier 1935, 233 fig. 1 10) indicates that they almost certainly come from the same source, presum- ably somewhere in central Crete. Type 6 is wheelmade and seems to be a development of Type 4. It continues to have a rounded profile on the lower side, but now has a slightly raised foot and wider mouth. The 32 examples in the catalogue (239, 242, 340-68 and 998-9) are mostly fragments. Diameters are 9.0-14.0 cm at the rim and 3.0-5.0 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated and decorated with wavy- lines and polychrome filling elements in the Wavy-line Style. A selection showing a variety of patterns is given in FIG. 2. 5. The numerous examples are from the mixed contexts of Groups E and N. However, very similar cups, with Wavy-line Style decoration, are found in the MM II B destruction deposits at Phaistos, and provide a firm date for both the type and the style (F. 521, 527, 1430, 6018, 6147, 6148; Pernier 1935, pl. 21a; Levi 1976, pl. 64). This is confirmed by an example from Anemospilia near Archanes (Sakellarakis 1979, pl. 183b; 1 99 1, 144 fig. 120). This 'wavy-line cup' may be the successor to the cups of Type 4 in Egg-shell Ware, which do not seem to have been produced after the MM II A period. A possible successor to this MM II B version may be seen in a MM HI cup type from Kommos (Betancourt 1990, fig. 38 no. 790). Later still is the rounded cup, decorated in the Finicky Style of the MM HI B period (Evans 1921, 595 fig. 437C-e), two examples of which are illustrated in PLATE 58. These distinctive cups are one of the most popular central Cretan ceramic products to be exported during MM II B. Examples are found at Palaikastro (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 16 fig. 10) Phylakopi (Papa- giannopoulou 1991, nos. 346, 359, 361), Kea (Overbeck 1989, 182 pl. 85 DG. 16), Ugarit (Schaeffer 1949, 256 fig. 1 09 A) and Tell el-Dab'a (Walberg 1991, 1 17 pls. 1- 2; MacGillivray 1995). Type 7 is wheelmade, has a sharply offset rim and stands on a raised base. The four examples in the catalogue (413-16) are 6.5 cm high, diameters are 9.0-10.0 cm at the rim and 4.0 and 4.6 cm at the base. All are from the</page><page sequence="76">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 77 mixed context of Group E, but are in Precision Grooved Ware and decorated in the White-spotted Style. The form is not found in the Period 3 deposits at Phaistos, but also does not appear in the MM HI A groups from the town and acropolis at Knossos. It seems that this type was produced for a short time, either at the very end of the Old Palace period, or early in MM HI A. Shallow Angular Bowl Two types of shallow bowl, with angular profile, verti- cal handles and spouts at either end, are found in the early groups of the Old Palace. Type 1 is handmade, with loop handles and a raised outward splayed base. There is a complete example, 50, and a rim fragment, 51, that could come from this type of bowl. Both are monochrome coated and polychrome decorated, 50 in the Woven Style, and both belong in Group A, which suggests a date in MM I B for this type. Type 2 is wheelmade with a crinkle rim, cylindrical lambda-shaped handles on the upper side and flat base. The three examples in the catalogue (662, 926-7) are 50-5.5 cm high, diameters are 14.0-16.0 cm at the rim and c. 5.5 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated and polychrome decorated, and 926-7 are in Barbotine Ware. The examples are in Groups F and L, which in- dicates a date in the MM II A period for this type, which may, therefore, be the successor to Type 1 . Pyxis Small open vases, evidently designed to receive lids, are found in six types. Type 1 is wheelmade with a simple straight-sided pro- file and flat base. There are two examples in the cata- logue (648-9); both are monochrome coated, with white decoration, 648 in the White-banded Style, and belong to Group F, which supplies a date in the MM II A pe- riod for this type. Type 2 is wheelmade, with a distinctive out-turned rim, a slight groove in the upper side below the rim and two horizontal handles at the middle of the side. The single example in the catalogue (924) is monochrome coated, decorated in the White-banded Style and belongs to Group L, all of which place it in the MM II A period. Type j is wheelmade and has a distinctive angular pro- file, outward turned rim and two horizontal lugs on the side. The three examples in the catalogue (676, 762 and 806) are 5.5-6.3 cm high, diameters are 8.5-9.5 cm at the rim and 3.0-4.0 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated, with white or polychrome decoration, 806 in the White-banded Style. The examples are in Groups G, H and J and so the type belongs in the MM II A period. A pyxis of this type, found on the early floor beneath the Room of the Stone Pier (PLATE 141), fur- ther confirms the MM II A date. Type 4 is wheelmade, with a wide flat rim, two hori- zontal handles at the middle of the side and a slightly bevelled base. The two examples in the catalogue (757 and 760) are 5.2-5.5 cm high, diameters are 11. 0-12.0 cm at the rim and 7.5-9.0 cm at the base. Both are mono- chrome coated and 760 is decorated in the White- banded Style. Both are from Group H and there is a third example from the early floor beneath the Room of the Stone Pier (PLATE 141), all of which suggest a date in the MM II A period for this type. Type 5 is small and wheelmade, with a flattened, outsplayed rim, two imitation lugs on the side and an indented base. The two examples in the catalogue (287- 8) are 3.3 and 3.5 cm high, diameters are 8.0 and 9.0 cm at the rim and 5.5 and 6.0 cm at the base. Both are mono- chrome coated and decorated with white horizontal lines. Both are from the mixed context of Group E and so difficult to date with certainty. However, the type's general resemblance to the Crude Pyxis of Type 1 , a form of the MM II A period, and with a vase stratified below the MM II B destruction deposit in Trial KV (Popham 1974, 185 fig. 5.2), may indicate that it be- longs near the end of the MM II A period. Type 6 has a pronounced indent below the rim, two horizontal handles on the side and a bevelled base. It may be a developed form of Type 2. The lone example in the catalogue (289) is monochrome coated and deco- rated with horizontal white lines. It bears a resemblance to the Crude Pyxis of Type 2, but both forms belong to the mixed Group E and may not be dated conclusively. As it seems to be a developed form of Type 2, a date in MM II B may be put forward tentatively. Angular Bridge-spouted jfar (FIG. 2.15) Bridge-spouted or Hole-mouthed Jars with angular profile occur in two types in the early groups of the Old Palace period. Type 1 is handmade with two cylindrical lambda-shaped handles on the shoulder. Two sub-types may be distin- guished. Type 1 a has a simple, tapering lower side and flat base. Type ib has a moulded, slightly raised base. The two examples of Type ia in the catalogue (36 and 755) are 10.0-10.3 cm high, diameters are 10.3-11.0 cm at the rim and 5.0-5.7 cm at the base. Both are mono- chrome coated. The four examples of Type ib in the catalogue (796 and 903-5) are 9.8-13.5 cm high, diam- eters are 9.0-12.0 cm at the rim and 4.5-6.0 cm at the base. One is dark-on-buff decorated, the others are monochrome coated and 905 is decorated in the Di- agonal Red and White Style. The occurrence of Type 1</page><page sequence="77">78 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES jars in Groups A, H, J and L confirms that it belongs within the MM I B and MM II A periods. Type 2 is handmade and a large version of Type 1, but with a distinctive thickened and flat rim. The six ex- amples of this type in the catalogue (75, and 193-7) are fragmentary, but the average dimensions may be roughly 17.0 cm in height with rim diameters 12.0-14.0 cm and base diameters 8.0-10.0 cm. All six examples are mono- chrome coated and decorated in the Woven Style, the variety of the decorative patterns is shown in FIG. 2.3. The almost complete example from Group A and the type's exclusive use of the Woven Style place it in the MM I B period. There is a rim fragment from a jar of this type from the North Quarter of the City (Momigliano 1991, 181 fig. 6.36) and three fragmentary examples without spe- cific provenance from Knossos in the Ashmolean Mu- seum (AE 959 and AE 1032. 1) and the British Museum (Forsdyke 1925, A486), also decorated in the Woven Style. This type seems to be confined to the Knossos area, there being also at least one example from Juktas (Karetsou 1981 ¿, 144 fig. 8 nos. 6). Angular bridge- spouted jars are almost unknown in the Mesara; there being only one possible example from Phaistos (F. 264) as well as a stone variant (F 6245). The examples from Phylakopi are, thus, quite likely to be Knossian in ori- gin (Papagiannopoulou 1991, nos. 382, 386). Squat Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar There are two examples, 73-4, of handmade bridge- spouted jars with rounded bulge in the profile of the lower body, giving a squat appearance, two cylindrical lambda-shaped handles and simple flat base. The one intact example (73) is 8.5 cm high with rim and base diameter of 7.5 cm. Both examples are monochrome coated, decorated in the Woven Style and belong to Group A, which places them in the MM I B period. Baggy-shaped Bridge-spouted Jar Two fragments of bridge-spouted jars, with outsplayed and overhanging rims, cylindrical rounded handles and bag-shaped profiles, are in the catalogue (390-1). The shape of this type is reconstructed on the basis of close parallels from Phaistos (E 806). Both Knossian exam- ples are monochrome coated and polychrome decorated, 390 in the Spiral Band Style. They come from the mixed context of Group E, but the close correspondence to the Period 3 examples at Phaistos suggest a date in the MM II B period (F. 499, 806). An example in stone was found in a chamber tomb at Mycenae, where it was surely an heirloom (Xenaki-Sakellariou 1985, pl. 141 no. 4921). Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar (FIG. 2. 16) Bridge-spouted jars with rounded profile occur in six general types. Type 1 is a short, handmade jar with the spout pointing above the rim and cylindrical lambda-shaped handles. The single, well-preserved example in the catalogue (157) is 7.5 cm high with a rim diameter of 7.0 cm and base diameter of 8.7 cm. It is monochrome coated and white decorated and belongs to Group B, which sug- gests that this type should belong in the MM II A pe- riod. Type 2 is handmade, with a tapering lower side, flat base, raised rim and spout rising above the rim. The handles were probably cylindrical and lambda-shaped. The only preserved height is 10.0 cm. Diameters are 8.0 and 10.0 cm at the rim and 5.5 and 10.5 cm at the base. The four Fig. 2.15. Fine Buff Angular Bridge-spouted Jar Types. xu'W</page><page sequence="78">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 79 examples in the catalogue (46-7 and 76-7) are mono- chrome coated and decorated in the Woven Style and, as they are part of Group A, should be assigned to the MM I B period. Type 3 is an elegant, wheelmade equivalent to Type 2, with distinctive pointed handles that are triangular in section. There are two examples in the catalogue (127 and 247). The one restored example, 247, is 12.0 cm high. Diameters are 8.8 cm at the rim and 6.7 cm at the base. Both examples are in Pattern Painted Ware. The fragmentary example in Group A may indicate the type's beginning in the MM I B period, though it seems to belong in both periods 1 and 2 at Phaistos (e.g. Levi 1976, 144 fig. 215; Levi and Carinci 1988, pl. 53) and so may have continued into MM II A. Type 4 is a wheelmade jar, with tall tapering base, rounded shoulder, spout rising only slightly above the rim and thick, rounded handles with a roughly rectan- gular section. There are 33 examples in the catalogue (290-1, 665, 688 and 930-58). They are 13.5-15.5 cm high. Diameters are 7.5-9.5 cm at the rim and 5.0-6.0 cm at the base. Examples are monochrome coated and white or polychrome decorated. The frequency of ex- amples in Group L and its occurrence also in Groups F and G indicate a MM II A date for the type. Among the numerous examples in Group L, work- shop groups may be suggested (MacGillivray 1985). It is quite likely that this type and the next were fitted with lids, as seen on the stone copy from Mycenae (Xenaki-Sakellariou 1985, pl. 97 no. 3050). Lids simi- lar to 684 would fit well on this type of vase. Fig. 2.16. Fine Buff Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar Types. TT~) Vf) ' ^ 1 '_L^^2</page><page sequence="79">8o POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES Type 5 is wheelmade with a bulbous profile, spout ris- ing above the rim, and handles very much like those on Type 4. There are ten examples in the catalogue (379- 88). They are 10.5-12.0 cm high. Diameters are 7.5- 10.0 cm at the rim and 5.6 cm at the base. All are mono- chrome coated and polychrome decorated, and are from the mixed context of Group E. Its use with the Sun- rise, 385-7, and Spiral Band, 379-84, styles indicates popularity during MM II B. A similar form decorated with sunrise motifs, from Context 19 at Kommos, could be a MM HI A development to the type (Betancourt 1990, no. 822). Examples in stone, probably heirlooms and certainly imports, were found in chamber tombs at Mycenae (Xenaki-Sakellariou 1985, pls. 97 no. 3050, 141 no. 4922). Type 6 is wheelmade, with a tall profile tapering to- wards the base, slightly raised rim, spout rising above the rim and handles like those on types 4 and 5. There are two examples in the catalogue (389 and 1002). They are 14.2 and 15.0 cm high, diameters are 9.8 and 16.5 cm at the rim and 6.5 and 6.6 cm at the base. Both are monochrome coated and polychrome decorated, but neither in any of the distinctive styles. The occurrence of these examples in Groups E and N place the type at the end of the Old Palace period, confirmed by a single example from the destruction deposit in Trial KV (Popham 1974, 188 fig. 7.2, pl. 29a). The very similar rounded bridge-spouted jar from a grave in Byblos, decorated in the Wavy-line Style, further confirms a MM II B date (Baramki 1973, pl. IV. 1). In general, the rounded bridge-spouted jar of MM III stands on an elongated foot (Betancourt 1985 ay 106 fig. 77; Levi and Carinci 1988, pl. 58). Miniature jar 377 conforms to the MM HI type and could be one of the latest items in Group E. Jug with Cut-away Spout (FIG. 2. 17) Four types of jug with cut-away spout may be distin- guished. Type 1 is handmade, with a squat profile and flat han- dle. There are three examples in the catalogue (23, 48 and 199). They are 10.0-1 1 .0 cm high, with base diam- eters of 6.5 and 7.5 cm. They are buff-reserved deco- rated and monochrome coated, with white or poly- chrome decoration. The two examples in Group A sug- gest that this type belongs in the MM I B period. This is further confirmed by the presence of an example in Hogarth's Early Heap, S of the West Court (Hogarth and Welch 1901, pl. Vic). Hogarth's group also con- tained a Straight-sided cup of Type 2 (ibid., pl. Vllb). The decoration on Convex-sided Cup 42 and Jug 48 is so similar that they may come from the same work- shop, thus suggesting that this type belongs early in MM IB. Type 2 is wheelmade, with a large opening at the rim. There is one example in the catalogue (1034), which belongs to Group O. Another example was found on the early floor beneath the Room of the Stone Pier (PLATE 141 bottom, far right), which may place this type in the MM II A period. Type 3 is wheelmade with a rounded body, tall spout and strap handle. There is one example in the catalogue (250) and the possible bases of others from the same context are visible in PLATE 51, top left. As the exam- ple belongs to Group D, it cannot be assigned to a spe- cific period, though the majority of the material from the North- West Pit should be taken as MM II A on sty- listic grounds. The decoration on 250 is so similar to that on a Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar of Type 4 from Kahun that they should be regarded as products of the same workshop; in which case the most likely date for the type is in the MM II A period (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 57-9 fig. 22 Ha. 1). Type 4 is wheelmade, with a tall shape, tapering lower body and three strap handles attached at the rim and middle of the side. There are two examples in the cata- logue (687 and 988). The restored example, 988, is 17.5 cm high, base diameters are 3.5 and 4.0 cm. Both ex- amples are monochrome coated and white decorated. They belong to Groups G and N, which provides a date in the MM II A period for its start and the end of the Old Palace period for its finish, the latter confirmed by an example from Anemospilia (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1979, pl. 183). A possible third example, from the con- text of Group N, is shown in PLATE 144 d. Jug with Horizontal Spout (FIG. 2.18) There are three general types of rounded jugs with hori- zontal spouts. Type 1 is wheelmade, with a long, cylindrical neck and rounded handle. There are three examples in the cata- logue (685-6 and 825). They are 9.0-10.0 cm high. Diameters are 3.5-4.0 cm at the base and 2.9-3.8 cm at the rim. The examples are monochrome coated and white or polychrome decorated. The occurrence of this type in Group G suggests that it should belong in the MM II A period. The example from Group K, then, may belong to the early group of pottery from the Loom weight Basement, see above Chapter 1, Part 5. Type 2 is wheelmade with a slightly squat rounded body and rounded handle pushed into the rim. There is one example in the catalogue (928) in Group L, suggesting that this type originates in the MM II A period. A simi- lar jug, with very similar decoration, is known from</page><page sequence="80">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 8 1 Fig. 2.1 7. Fine Buff Jug with Cut-away Spout Types. /n ft? ^^^ 1 ' I- ^r 2 (5 (5 Hogarth's Later Heap in the town of Knossos; it could be an heirloom or may show continuity of the type into the MM III A period (Hogarth and Welch 1901, fig. 18). A third example, in the Liverpool Museum, is from Knossos but without more detailed provenance (Mee and Doole 1993, no. 55.66.77). Type j is wheelmade, with a tapering lower body and rounded handle pushed well into the rim of the spout, causing an indent. There are two examples in the cata- logue (1040 and 1042). They are n.oand 15.5 cm high, with base diameters of 3.3 and 4.5 cm. Both are mono- chrome coated and 1042 is decorated in the White-spot- ted Style. Both belong to Group P which places the type in the MM HI A period. Further confirmation for the date comes from an example in the White-spotted Style, from Hogarth's Later Heap in the town of Knossos (Hogarth and Welch 1 901, 90 fig. 19), and by the occurrence of a very similar form in Deposit C in the Knossos Acropolis Houses (Catling et al. 1979, 35 fig. 23 V.i 54). Fig. 2.18. Fine Buff Jug with Horizontal Spout Types. &amp;. cÏÏ &lt;S</page><page sequence="81">82 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES Rhyton Fragments of two types of rhyton appear in the later groups from the Old Palace. Type i is conical, with a flat rim, strap handle and me- tallic-like rounded additions at the rim. There are three examples in the catalogue (395-7). The height may be suggested by the reconstruction of 395 to be roughly 27.0 cm. Rim diameters are 7.5 and 8.0 cm. All three examples are in Pattern Painted Ware and from the mixed context of Group E. A MM II B date could be proposed because of the similarity of the decoration on 395 with that on a straight-sided cup in Precision Stamped Ware from a MM II floor deposit near the Knossos North House (Warren 1 981, 74 fig. 3). How- ever, very similar forms appear in Period 4 at Phaistos (F. 4263, 5778) and in MM III contexts at Kommos (Betancourt 1990, no. 652; 1985, 105 fig. 77; Koehl 1981, 180 fig. 1). Type 1, then, must be placed at the 'cusp' and regarded as one of the first conical rhytons in Crete. Type 2 appears to be globular, but the examples pre- serve only the lower opening, so that no reconstruction of the middle and upper side is possible. There are two examples in the catalogue (398-9). The former has a well-defined flat, raised opening at the base, like KoehPs MM III A/B type, the later has a simple, pierced open- ing with slightly raised rim like Koehl's MM II B type (Koehl 1 98 1, 180 fig. 1). Both examples are found in Group E and so are problematic. However, an example from Phaistos may give the complete profile for this type and suggests that it belongs in the MM II B pe- riod (F. 1036). PART 2. THE FINE BUFF CRUDE WARE i. Definition A very distinctive class of wheelmade pottery appears at Knossos during the course of the Old Palace period. It consists of simplified versions of some types we have looked at in Fine Buff Ware, that are here 'Mass pro- duced and clumsily made' (Popham 1974, 186), ignor- ing quality but with a view to quick and plentiful pro- duction, perhaps as containers used only once. This class is manufactured by centering a large cone or hump of clay on the potter's wheel and throwing small pots in rapid succession without having to re-centre a new measure of clay (Van As 1984, 150 fig. 5). This innova- tion was almost certainly learned from Egyptian pot- ters and was retained by the Cretans into the MM III and LM I periods, to manufacture the conical cups that are found in such quantities that they have become sub- jects of some derision by Aegean archaeologists (Caskey and Huxley 1978). There are fourteen forms manufactured in this man- ner in the Old Palace period. They are called 'Crude Types' here, meaning rough and hastily made - lack- ing in refinement, in order to distinguish them from the finer varieties of the forms. ii. Typology Crude Bowl (FIG. 2.19) There are four types of bowls thrown off the hump that can be distinguished by differences in shape. Type 1 is a shallow bowl with a very thick section, flat base and rounded rim. There are five examples in the catalogue (446-50), and others from the same context which could not be found (PLATE 61). They are 3.0- 3.5 cm high with rim diameters 9.5-10.0 cm and base diameters 5.0-5.5 cm. All are plain and belong to the mixed context of Group E. A date in the MM II B pe- riod may be proposed, on the basis of close similarities with examples from the final destruction deposit in Trial KV at Knossos (Popham 1974, fig. 6.1-5), and perhaps by its absence from the earliest groups at the Knossos Acropolis Houses (Catling et al.y 1979, 21-5). Type 2 is a shallow bowl, with wide flat base and simple outward splayed rim. There are 30 examples in the cata- logue (161, 451-6, 708-16, 772-6, 854-60 and 959-60). They vary in height from 2.0-4.0 cm; diameters are 8.5-1 1 .5 cm at the rim and 3.5-5.0 cm at the base. Ex- amples are plain or sprayed with dark paint, but never otherwise decorated. The frequency of examples in Groups B, G, H, and L, and their occurrence in the early floor deposit below the Room of the Stone Pier (PLATE 141) suggest a MM II A date for the appear- ance of this type. Its continued production, without ob- Fig. 2.IÇ. Fine Buff Crude Bowl Types. c I ^P</page><page sequence="82">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 83 vious change, into MM II B is shown by its occurrence in Group E, the destruction deposit in Trial KV (Popham 1974, fig. 6. 6-7) and in the pit of Tomb XVII at Mavrospilio (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 no. 23). This type is the most obvious predecessor of the ubiquitous conical cup of the neopalatial period (e.g. Fiandra 1973, pl. 32; Catling et al 1979, 23-4 fig. 21; Gillis 1990). Type J is a shallow bowl, with distinctive, slightly rounded profile and flattened rim, with varying degrees of outward projection. There are 45 examples in the catalogue (457-63, 467-9, 7i7~32&gt; 777-82, 861-70 and 961-3). They are 1.5-3.5 cm high, diameters are 8.5- 1 0.0 cm at the rim and 3.5-5.5 cm at the base. Exam- ples are plain, dark-sprayed, partially dipped in dark paint or monochrome coated. The frequency of this type in Groups G, H, and L, and in the early floor de- posit below the Room of the Stone Pier (PLATE 141), indicate that it begins in the MM II A period. That it continues to be manufactured in MM II B is confirmed by its occurrence in Group E, the destruction deposit in Trial KV (Popham 1974, fig. 6. nos. 8 and 16) and the pit in Mavrospilio Tomb XVII (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 nos. 19 and 20). There are also similar bowls from destruction deposits of Period 3 at Phaistos (Fiandra 1973, pi- 31; Levi 1976, pl. 143). A later development of this type may be the everted rim bowl of the MM III A period (Catling et al 1979, 27 fig. 21 V.61-3). Type 4 is a shallow bowl, with distinctive angular pro- file and slightly flattened, out-turned rim. There are three examples in the catalogue (464-6). They are 3.2- 3.4 cm high, diameters are 8.5-10.0 cm at the rim and 3.3-5.5 at the base. The occurrence of this type in Groups E and N (PLATE 144 w), and in the destruction deposit in Trial KV (Popham 1974, fig. 6 no. 8) provide a date in the MM II B period for the type. Crude Pyxis (FIG. 2.20) There are three examples of a deep, straight-sided form with horizontal groove below an out-turned rim (470- 1 and 735), that are the crude equivalent to the Fine Buff Ware Pyxis of Type 5. They are 3.3-4.8 cm high, diameters are 8.2-8.9 cm at the rim and 5.0-6.0 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated. The example in Group G suggests that this type begins in the MM II A period. A contemporary parallel for 735 may be the ex- ample from the silt layer below the destruction deposit in Trial KV (Popham 1974, fig. 5 no. 2). The form's continued use, perhaps slightly deeper and with a more pronounced groove in the side, into the MM II B pe- riod is suggested by 470-1 from Group E. Crude Goblet (FIG. 2.20) There are seventeen examples of simple rounded gob- lets (158-60, 689-98, 763-5 and 813), that are the rough version of the Rounded Goblets of Type 2 in Fine Buff Ware. They are 4.0-5.0 cm high with diameters of 8.5 cm at the rim 3.5-5.0 cm at the base. All are plain and their occurrence in Groups B, G and H suggests that they belong only in the MM II A period at Knossos; this is confirmed by their presence in the early floor deposit in Early West Magazine 2 (Brown 1983, 68-9 figs. 36b, c). In the Mesara, a related type seems to have persisted into the MM II B period at Phaistos (Levi 1976, 274 fig. 431; Fiandra 1973), and Kommos where they are called 'conical cups' (Betancourt 1985a, 92-3 figs. 65- 6; 1986, fig. 2 12-15). Fig. 2.20. Fine Buff Crude Pyxis and Goblet Types. Crude Cup (FIG. 2.21) There are four general types of cups produced in this class of pottery. Type 1 is a simple, straight-sided conical-shaped cup without handle. There are 22 examples in the catalogue (472-91 and 699-700). They are 5.0-6.0 cm high with diameters of 6.5-9.0 cm at the rim and 3.5-4.5 cm at the base. The examples in Group H suggest that the type was first produced in MM II A. It seems to have been more popular in the MM II B period, as shown by the numerous examples in Group E, the destruction deposit in Trial KV (Popham 1974, figs. 6 no. 10, 8 nos. 1, 4 and 7) and the pit in Mavrospilio Tomb XVII (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 no. 25). Type 2 is a straight-sided cup like Type 1, but with a vertical strap handle. It may be the rough equivalent to the Straight-sided cup Type 5 in Fine Buff Ware. There are 15 examples in the catalogue (701-7, 766-71, 810 and 812). They are 5.0-6.0 cm high with diameters of 8.5-9.0 cm at the rim and 4.4-5.0 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated. The occurrence of this type in Groups G, H and J of the Royal Pottery Stores sug- gests that it belongs in the MM II A period, for which it should be regarded as a type-fossil. Type j is a one-handled straight-sided cup like Type 2, but the handle is smaller and rougher and, in most cases, too small to function as a handle; it is more like a grip in the shape of a handle. There are 17 examples in the catalogue (492-500 and 826-33, and others, that could</page><page sequence="83">84 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES Fig. 2.21. Fine Buff Crude Cup Types. ' U 3 i - Vm* not be found, from Group E (PLATE 6i) and Group N (PLATE 144/) contexts. They are 5.4-6.8 cm high, with diameters of 8.5-9.5 cm at the rim and 4.2-5.0 cm at the base. All are monochrome coated. The occurrence of this type in Groups E and N and the presence of two examples in the destruction level in Trial KV (Popham 1974, fig. 6 nos. 11 and 13) and three in the pit in Mavrospilio Tomb XVII (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 no. 24) place it firmly in MM II B. Type 4 has a roughly angular profile, which in most cases has a small, rough handle or grip like that on Type 3. There are 23 examples in the catalogue (501-16, 811 and 834-9, and there are others, that could not be found, from Group E (PLATES 61, 64) and Group N (PLATE 144 r) contexts. They are 4.5-6.8 cm high, with diam- eters of 7.0-9.0 cm at the rim and 3.4-5.0 cm at the base. The numerous examples from Group E, Trial KV (Popham 1974, fig. 6 nos. 1 1-1 5), the pit in Mavrospilio Tomb XVII (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 no. 26) and a MM II deposit in the town of Knossos (Warren 1981, 74 fig. 4 right) help assign this type in the MM II B period. The single example in Group J is problematic; it could indicate that this type begins in the MM II A period, or 811 may have been incorrectly recorded at the time of excavation. Crude Amphoriskos (FIG. 2.22) There are two examples, 519-20, of small closed jars similar in profile to the crude juglet, but with two false handles represented by arched folds of clay on the sides. (5 &amp; Fig. 2.22. Fine Buff Crude Amphoriskos and Juglet Types. Both are plain and part of Group E, and, in the absence of close parallels, could belong in either the MM II B or MM III A periods. Crude Juglet (FIG. 2.22) There are 22 examples (521-6, 736-7 and 840-53) of small juglets with horizontal spout and arched round handle in the catalogue, and a further three from Group E (PLATE 61). They are 4.7-8.1 cm high, with diam- eters of 2.5-4.0 cm at the rim and 3.4-5.0 cm at the base. Examples are sprayed with dark paint or mono- chrome coated. The two examples in Group G suggest a date in MM II A for the beginning of this type, which becomes quite common in the MM II B period, as shown by the examples from Group E, Trial KV (Popham 1974, fig. 6 nos. 23 and 25), the pit in Mavrospilio Tomb XVII (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 no. 28) and Anemospilia (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1979, pl. 183). The neopalatial successor to this form may be seen in deposits at the Unexplored Mansion (Popham 1984, pls. 131), I37d, 143 nos. 15-17) and Stratigraphical Museum Excavations (Warren 1991a, 323 pl. 77G). Crude Jug (FIG. 2.23) There are two types of crude jug with cut-away spout. Type 1 is a small slightly rounded jug, with rough han- dle or grip like those on Crude cups of Types 3 and 4. There are two examples in the catalogue (527-8). They are 7.0 and 7.8 cm high with base diameters of 3.0-4.0 cm. Both are plain and belong to Group E, which could indicate that they belong in the MM II B and/or MM III A periods. This type also seems to be a late occur- rence at Phaistos (F. 4401; Levi 1976, 500 fig. 771). Type 2 is a large rounded jug, with round handle and raised base. There are two examples in the catalogue (529-30). They are 10.5 and 10.7 cm high with base diameters of 5.0 and 5.5 cm. Both have the body coated in dark brown paint. Its occurrence in Group E and in the pit in Mavrospilio Tomb XVII (Forsdyke 1927, 281 pl. 23 no. 32) suggest a date in the MM II B period.</page><page sequence="84">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 85 iff ffl Fig. 2.23. Fine Buff Crude Jug Types. Comment This class of mass-produced or Crude Ware pottery was introduced to Crete during the MM II A period. There are no related products in the MM I A or MM I B groups at Knossos, nor do they occur in the Period 1 deposits at Phaistos. The typology and chronology proposed here reflects manufacture and consumption at Knossos. Crude Ware seems to be very much a 'domestic' product. The equivalent wares in the Mesara seem to follow a con- sistent but different pattern, as do those in E Crete. For example, Crude Juglets similar to those in the MM II B groups at Knossos do not seem to appear in the Mesara until the MM III period (Betancourt 1985a, 107 fig. 79; Levi and Carinci 1988, pls. 36Ì, k, 1, m, 38f; Betancourt 1990, no. 828). Also, the Crude Goblet, found only in MM II A at Knossos, continues to ap- pear until the end of MM II B at Phaistos and Kommos. Regionalism continues to be a factor with the ubiqui- tous conical cups of the neopalatial period's crude pot- tery (Gillis 1990, 140). An obvious source of inspiration for the manufac- turing technique is found in Egypt, where the radial centred potter's wheel was introduced during the Vth Dynasty and where by the time of XI-XHth Dynasty wheel thrown pottery was in the majority (Arnold 1993, 43). A clear depiction of throwing off the hump may be seen in the paintings, showing a potter's workshop, on the W wall of the Main Chamber of the tomb of the nomarch Amenemhat at Beni Hasan from the end of the reign of Senwosret I, c. 1908 BC, perhaps less than a generation before Crude Ware appears in Crete (Newbury 1893, pl. XI fourth register; Warren and Hankey 1989, 170 note 11). That the Cretans made the technique their own is shown by the forms they chose to produce: primarily bowls and cups, that had already been a part of their repertory. PART 3. MINORITY FABRICS A minority of pottery occurs in fabrics other than Fine Buff. These were sorted on the basis of macroscopic observation of their colour, texture and content. Note- worthy is the fact that the types noted in Fine Buff Fab- ric are not present in any of the minor fabrics. i. Minor Buff Fabrics A significant percentage of pottery was produced with the same hard pink to buff matrix as Fine Buff with varying concentrations of inclusions. Semifine Buff 668, 738-41, 871-3 are in the same hard clay as Fine Buff, but with an uneven texture and reddish-brown flaky inclusions, which do not appear to have been added intentionally as tempering agents. 738-9 and 871-2 are fragments of closed jars, deco- rated with dark-on-buff patterns with added white paint. Although none could be restored, they resemble a class of large jars from the Royal Road at Knossos (Daux i960, 834 fig. 1), Phaistos (e.g. F. 227, 1042, 1959, 4218, 5937) and Kommos (Betancourt 1990, nos. 1254- 5). Gritty Buff 130-6 are in Fine Buff clay but with dark and light rounded pebble-like inclusions giving it a gritty tex- ture. The radiating decoration on large jug 134 is very similar to that on a number of forms from Phaistos (e.g. F. 41 1, 473, 611, 4715, 4796, 5032) and on an amphora from Malia, which may be from central Crete (Pelagatti 1962, no). Many of the parallels are decorated with dark-on-buff patterns, with added white paint, linking this class with Semifine Buff. Tempered Buff 165, 255-61, 558-86, 670, 742-6, 875-9 and 1010-11 are in the same hard matrix as Fine Buff and resemble Gritty Buff, but have dark angular inclusions added as a tempering agent. This may correspond to the Tem- pered Buff fabric at Kommos (Betancourt 1990, 9-10), although the temper in the Knossos pottery is quite angular, as if it had been crushed before being added to the clay mixture. This fabric is indistinguishable mac- roscopically from the tempered buff pottery of Phaistos, where most of the closest parallels in form and decora- tion are found. Two decorative styles are worth mentioning here. One uses the spiky foliate band and running S-spiral motifs, in a manner very similar to the Spiral Banded Style in Fine Buff Fabric, but on large jars (566, 585-6 and 876-8) and on the rims of large bowls (575-9). A second style features a large abstract floral motif in the centre of each side on large closed jars. 583-4 are two examples of large, horizontal-rimmed jugs with abstract floral motif on the shoulder, represented by numerous fragments of similar jugs and oval-mouthed amphorae</page><page sequence="85">86 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES in the same style among the sherd material from Group E in the KSM. A complete example of the type and decoration was found in the destruction horizon at Anemospilia Q. and E. Sakellarakis 1991, fig. 120). Evans published a restored drawing of an oval-mouthed amphora decorated in the same abstract floral style and said to be from the Temple Repositories (1921, 596 pl. VII). If the sherds he based the drawing on were in fact found in the Temple Repositories, they would consti- tute the only vase of the Old Palace period in an other- wise late neopalatial group. A firm date for the charac- teristic abstract floral decoration in the MM II B pe- riod is provided by the Anemospilia jug. 165, 582, 585-6 and 876-7 are large spouted jars of a type well-known at Phaistos (Levi and Carinci 1988, 1 10-16, pls. 49-52). 255 is fragments of a closed jar, most likely a jug of a type best known from Phaistos (e.g. F. 717, 5293) also found at Kommos (Betancourt 1990, fig. 13 pl. 3 no. 64, fig. 43 pl. 54 nos. 959-6o)- 259 and 260 are fragments of cylindrical spouted jars, quite similar to a common type from Phaistos (Levi and Carinci 1988, 137-8, pl. 59). Offering tables (256-8, 670 and 746) find close par- allels in the Period 2 fruit-stands of Phaistos (ibid., 17- 18 pl. io; Fiandra 1980, pl. 38.5), but differ from those of Malia, for which our 647 is a close parallel (Van Effenterre 1980 ay 206 fig. 287). Askoid jug 560 is one of the most characteristic forms at Phaistos (Levi and Carinci 1988, 85-7 pls. 40-1), and is decorated with dark-on-buff patterns outlined in white paint, which links this fabric to Semifine and Gritty Buff. Large bowls 574-80 are closely related in form and decoration to examples from the end of the Old Palace period at Phaistos (e.g. F. 5186). The few parallels cited here make it clear that the mi- nor buff fabrics, like Fine Buff, are most common in central Crete and originate either at Knossos or Phaistos; or, more likely, come from a small number of sources in N and S central Crete, which can only be identified through physical analysis of the pottery, in conjunction with geological prospection and pétrographie analysis of the beds producing the white clays of central Crete. it. Soft Buff Fabrics Pottery in a soft and porous buff coloured matrix, less dense than Fine Buff, follows roughly the same divi- sions into sub-groups on the basis of macroscopically visible inclusions. Fine Soft Buff 129, 252-4, 531-45, 667, 874 and 1004-7 are in a well- levigated soft buff matrix. Large jars 532-4 are decorated in a manner very simi- lar to the Spiral Banded Style of Fine Buff Fabric. 129, 535 and 537 are undecorated, straight-sided pyxides; 536 and 538 are lids that may belong to pyxides. A similar form is found at Phaistos where, however, it also seems to be rare (Levi and Carinci 1988, 158 pl. 69e). 252-3 resemble in form the distinctive loop-handled bowls found at Phaistos (F. 4942, 5099; Levi and Carinci 1988, 172-3 pl. 75g, h), Kommos (Betancourt 1990, 159 fig. 52 pl. 69 nos. 1 28 1 -2) and Plátanos (Xanthoudides 1924, 98 pl. IX no. 6859) in the Mesara, but are deco- rated very much like shallow rounded bowls from Palaikastro (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 11-12 pl. VI B-D). This form is the closest ceramic parallel to the gold loop-handled bowl in the Tôd Treasure (Bisson de la Roque et al 1953, pl. XVIII 70631; Hood 1978, 154 fig. 145 b). Bridge-spouted jars 874 and 1004 are decorated with a similar pattern in a dark-on-buff style with added white paint. In a related style are 667 and 531. Jugs 540-1 are in a dark-on-buff style with added white, but have the additional use of orange paint. Rhyta 539 and 1005 are both decorated with dark- on-buff ripple burnished patterns, anticipating the Tor- toise-shell Ripple ware of the MM III B period (dis- cussed below). 542-5 are a group of jugs, with distinctive beaked spouts, with lugs on the sides and neck mouldings. The spouts are coated in a creamy-white paint and deco- rated with vertical floral designs in red. Evans (1935, 120) referred to these jugs as his 'Creamy-bordered Class' (discussed below). Gritty Soft Buff 148-52, 164, 598-603, 750-3, 886-8 and 971 are in a soft buff matrix with numerous sandy grits and tiny flecks of silver mica. Most examples are slipped red and burnished, and appear to imitate stone vases. This fab- ric was evidently used primarily for the manufacture of lamps, for which a basic typology is proposed here: a. Hand Lamp Types (FIG. 2.24) Small lamps with long handles opposite the opening for a spout or wick occur in two types. Type 1 has an angular profile due to its incurving rim. There are seven examples in the catalogue (148-51, 751- 2 and 971). They are 3.0-3.5 cm high, with diameters of 7.0-12.0 cm at the rim and 4.5-8.0 cm at the base. The occurrence of this type in Groups A, G and L sug- gests that it belongs in both the MM I B and MM II A periods. The early date is borne out by a similar type in a Period 1 context at Phaistos (F. 5321a). Type 2 has an outsplayed profile, with flattened inward sloping rim. There are five examples in the catalogue (598-71 and 887). They are 3.0-3.7 cm high, with di- ameters of 10.0-1 1.5 cm. The examples are in Groups E and K and there is a further example from Group N in PLATE 114, and one from Trial KV (Popham 1974,</page><page sequence="86">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 87 fig. 8.9); all indicate a date in the MM II B period. A similar and contemporary type is found in deposits of Period 3 at Phaistos (Levi 1976, pl. 156 a-e, g; F. 4725, 6142, 1311,4727). Perhaps a later development of this type may be seen in the hand lamps from the MM HI A and MM HI B deposits B and C in the Acropolis Houses (Catling et al 1979, 34-5 figs. 22.138, 23.161). b. Pedestalled Lamp Types (FIG. 2.24) Wide, shallow lamps, with at least two diametrically opposed spouts and standing on tall pedestalled bases, are found in two types. Type 1 has a thick outsplayed profile and rounded rim. There are two examples in the catalogue (152 and 753). The average height is around 20.0 cm; rim diameters are 19.0 and 30.0 cm. Examples are from Groups A and G and the Vat Room Deposit (Evans 1 921, 167 fig. 1 1 8a. 1 2) giving a date in the early part of the Old Pal- ace period at Knossos. The type may have begun ear- lier, as an example in stone found in a MM I A level on the Royal Road suggests (Warren 1969, 52 P292), though the publication of its associated context is pending. Re- lated types at Phaistos seem to appear in Period 1 (F. 2313) and slightly later (F. 54, 381). Type 2 has a thin profile with sharply downturned rim. There is one example in the catalogue (888) in Group K, which may indicate that this type belongs in MM II B. This date is supported by a lamp of this type in Group E (PLATE 3 1 ), a short version in Group N (PLATE 1 14) and an example from Trial KV (Popham 1974, pl. 32.C). Comparable forms from Phaistos (F. 1567) and Palaikastro (MacGillivray, Sackett et al 1992, fig. 12. 10) may be contemporary. The gritty sandy inclusions and burnished exterior link this fabric to the Lamp Fabric of Kommos (Betancourt 1990, 1 1-12, 156, no. 1072) though it is not considered local to the site. The contemporary lamps of Phaistos have been studied by Mercando (1980), Levi and Carinci (1988), and Speziale (1993), but the complexities of the Phaistos stratigraphy have produced typologies not quite compatible with Knossos. Also in this fabric are a small angular jug (164) which finds a close parallel in a jug from Early West Maga- zine 2 (Brown 1983, 68-9 fig. 36), a bowl with internal tripartite divisions (750) and a large shallow tray coated with a thick white paint (886) similar to the Creamy- bordered class. Tempered Soft Buff 546-57 and 1008-9 are ìn a s°ft buff matrix with nu- merous and varied angular inclusions. There is a re- semblance to Tempered Buff, but without the charac- teristic density of dark angular inclusions. 546 and 1008 are amphoriskoi very similar to unguentaria from all stages of the Old Palace period at Phaistos (e.g. E 5157, 5291, 6231). Lid (1009) which may fit the amphoriskoi, also finds close parallels at Phaistos (F. 2693, 6269). Fig. 2.24. Gritty Soft Buff Lamp Types. (~ 1 _5^ 1 c_ L___zÉ* 2</page><page sequence="87">88 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 548-51 are large bowls with stamped, incised or moulded decoration and belong to Evans' Creamy-bor- dered class, providing a link with Fine and Gritty Soft Buff. Similar bowls and stands are known from Phaistos (e.g. E 480, 4928). Large bowls (552-5) and a large jar (557) are deco- rated with dark-on-buff ripple burnished patterns, similar to those on rhyta (539 and 1005), providing an- other link with Fine Soft Buff. 555 also has a zone of featherwave design, as does basin 556 (discussed below). Comment Three decorative styles exist in the Soft Buff fabrics that are not found in Fine Buff. Creamy-bordered Style, Evans' 'Creamy-bordered class' is identified by the technique of coating an extreme zone of a vase in thick creamy-white paint, but which also employs stamped, incised, moulded and modelled decoration, with motifs related to Precision Stamped Ware (Evans 1935, 120-2). Evans assigned this class to the MM II A period, but the Knossos examples are from Group E, and thus are more likely to belong in the MM II B or MM HI A periods. Examples at Phaistos are found in the destruction deposits of Period 3 (F. 480, 1477, 1905). Betancourt assigns a lone example from Kommos to MM II B on stylistic grounds (1990, 162 fig. 53 pl. 71 no. 1341), but the style clearly continues into the MM HI A period, as examples from Period 4 at Phaistos confirm (F. 4928; Pernier 1935, 371 fig. 222 top left). It is quite likely that some of the Knossos examples should also be placed in MM HI A, for instance jugs (542-5) have red painted lugs on the sides of the spouts, very much like those on conical rhyta from Knossos (395-7) Phaistos (F. 4029, 4263) and Kommos (Betancourt 1990, 111-12 fig. 31 pl. 38 no. 652), which are MM III in date. Related to the Creamy-bordered Style, and also in Soft Buff, are the terracotta shrine fragments found in the MM III fill in the Loomweight Basement, see above p. 41. Tortoise-shell Ripple Style. A second decorative style is distinguished by the application, in horizontal zones, of vertical bands of dark paint on a buff ground smoothed horizontally, to create the well-known ripple burnished or Tortoise-shell Ripple Style. Examples are bowls (552-5), a large basin (556) and a large jar (557). Evans illustrated part of a bowl with ripple burnished decoration, as an example of the style's early or MM II occurrence, since specimens were said to have been found in the Loomweight Basement (1921, 592 n.i fig. 435). There were no examples among the sherds kept from the Group K context; the sherd illustrated by Evans may have come from one of the fill levels, above the floor deposit in the Loomweight Basement. As the examples in the catalogue are from the mixed MM II B and MM III A context of Group E, it is not possible to support a firm MM II date for the first occurrence of the style at Knossos. Given its discovery in the early MM III contexts, 1 518, at Kommos (Betancourt 1990, nos. 499-500, 582, 729, 797) and Phaistos (F. 5219; Levi 1976, pl. 2i2r), and what are most likely mixed fills of the late MM II B and MM IH A periods at Palaikastro (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 23-4 figs. 13-14), it seems most sensible, for the time being, to accept that the style first comes into existence after the end of the Old Palace period, perhaps early in MM III A. It then develops into the painted, not burnished, Tortoise-shell Ripple Style, most characteristic of the early neopalatial period (Betancourt 19850, 1 13-14). Feather-wave Style. A third class, related to Ripple Burnished, is the Feather-wave Style. This is created by smearing a thin solution of dark paint on a buff ground in an undulating pattern, looking as though the tip of a feather was used instead of a fine paint brush, 555 and 556. Evans suggested that this style was created to imitate alabaster originals (1935, 122-4 figs- 9I-4)- Rare in central Crete, there being a few examples from Kommos (Betancourt 1990, nos. 590-1), the style may be more common in the E, where it is found in some quantity at Myrtos-Pyrgos (Cadogan 1978 a, 75 fig. 16, and personal communication) and examples are known from Priniatikos Pyrgos (Betancourt 1983, no. 23), Pseira (Seager 1910, 21), Palaikastro (Bernini 1995, 59- 62 fig. 4F) and Kato Zakros (Forsdyke 1925, A692). If the examples in Soft Buff are indeed all from the same source, it is difficult to suggest a likely place of origin. The parallels with similar forms from the Mesara are not as plentiful as with the Buff fabrics. There is a chronological problem as well. The amphoriskoi, lids and lamps belong to all stages of the Old Palace period; while the Creamy-bordered Style appears only at the end, and the Ripple Burnished and Feather- wave styles, after the end, of Old Palace period, during MM HI A; at this time there are fewer comparable deposits in the Mesara. East Cretan links are suggested by the period HI origin of the Feather- wave Style at Myrtos-Pyrgos, and the close similarity of bowls 252-3 with those found at Palaikastro. While one suspects that Soft Buff forms a coherent group, representing the products of one centre of inno- vative potters, little more can be said about its location until the fabric has been fully analyzed. Hi. Red Fabrics Fine Red A number of small, open, wheel-made forms are in a brick red coloured matrix with tiny flecks of silver mica. The surface is often slipped deep red-brown. Exam- ples are in Group A (138-45), Group E (587-90), Group F (669) and Group G (749) and so span the Old Palace period. The fabric is very similar to Momigliano's Fabric</page><page sequence="88">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 89 HI for the MM I A period pottery at Knossos (1991, 261-2). Examples of tumblers and other small, fine forms in this fabric are found in the Vat Room Deposit (Momigliano 1990) and are reported from the early deposit, beneath the floor in West Magazine 1 (Evans 1921, 172). 141-2 are made with a technique very similar to the Shallow Grooved Ware of the early part of the Old Pal- ace period at Knossos. They are quite close in form to examples in a related ware from the Trapeza Cave in Lasithi (Pendlebury et al. 1936, fig. 14). The clay and the forms are very similar to those of the Lasithi region and Myrtos-Pyrgos (Pendlebury et ai 1936, 59-69 fig. 14; Cadogan 1990). Dimopoulou and Rethemiotakis have found a workshop of the Old Palace period, producing a very similar class of ceram- ics at Kastelli-Pedhiada, a likely source for the Knossian pieces (Dimopoulou 1987; Rethemiotakis 1988; 1989; 1990). Coarse Red A small number of open and closed forms are made with a brick red coloured matrix, having inclusions of purple schist and tiny flecks of silver mica. 146 is in Group A and 591-7 are in Group E. 595 is an open bowl coated with a creamy slip and decorated in the Feather-wave Style, also found in Tempered Soft Buff Fabric. The fabric, surface treatment and style are well known from the early neopalatial period at Palaikastro, where 595 may have originated (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 33 fig. 21). 596-7 are hand lamps very much like the Type 2 hand lamps in Gritty Soft Buff Fabric. 592- 4 are curious, disc-shaped juglets without close paral- lel. iv. Fine Orange Fabric 605, 968 and 880-1 are distinctive wheel-made forms, made with a hard but flaking, layered, orange coloured matrix, apparently quite well-levigated, with very dis- creet flecks of silver mica. The pedestalled forms 605 and 880 are quite foreign to Knossos, but there is little evidence to suggest their origin. v. Redi Brown Fabric 747-8 and 785-7 from the Royal Pottery Stores are made from a soft, reddish-brown coloured matrix, with nu- merous sandy grits and tiny flecks of silver mica. 785 is similar to Fine Buff Shallow Bowls of Type 1 . The jugs and goblets are quite distinctive, yet without close par- allel. vi. Gritty Orange/ Buff Fabric 882-5 and 970 are wheel-made forms in a soft, orange to buff coloured matrix with numerous tiny rounded grits, and have a flaking surface. 883 is similar to Crude Cups of Type 4, otherwise this group is without close parallels. vii. Gritty Brown Fabric 137 is made from a soft brown, layered matrix fired dark- brown at the core and with white grit inclusions. The three-handled jar is in every way a singleton, perhaps a survivor from an earlier period. viii. Gritty Orange/ Brown Fabric 147 is made from an orange-brown coloured matrix with rounded red inclusions. Quite distinct from the Knossian pottery in fabric and style, macroscopically it most closely resembles the MM pottery of W Crete. ix. Cycladic Fabrics Cycladic White Ware 606 and 666 are in a fine, soft, light-buff to orange-buff coloured matrix filled with silver mica. At the time of its discovery, Mackenzie likened 666 to the pottery of Melos, with which he was familiar (1902 PB (2), 66). 606 is decorated in the Black and Red Style of Phylakopi (Atkinson et al. 1904, pls. 20-1), also found at Kea (Overbeck 1989, 76 pl. 52 Group AG vase 10a) and Naxos (Renfrew 1972, pl. 13. 1), but regarded as a Melian product by Barber (1978, 376). 607 and 608 are jug fragments in a hard, gritty, white clay, decorated with designs in a matt black paint and in a manner very similar to the Cycladic White style. Though Cycladic White Ware is characteristic both of Melos and Thera, and there are problems distinguish- ing the ceramics products of both islands (Jones 1986, 426, 429-30), Marthari might accept 607, with its quat- refoil disk-rosette decoration, as a Theran product (1993, 253). If so, it would join the MC jug from Lerna and help provide an equivalent Middle Helladic date to correspond to late MM II B or early MM IH A for the Theran style (Zerner 1990, 31 fig. 44). The Cycladic jug fragments from MM HI contexts at Kommos may also be Theran, and contribute to the image of links between Thera and central Crete early in the neopalatial period (Betancourt 1990, nos. 501, 592). The Cycladic vase, from a MM I B level in Royal Road South, seems to be from a jug of similar type to 606 and 666, and so could be from the same source, though of an earlier date (Hood i960, 23 fig. 24; 1966, no). Micaceous Buff 1012-20 are fragments of amphorae in a highly mica- ceous, buff fabric, with plain or self-smoothed surface and, in the case of 1012, with traces of thin, dull, dark- brown horizontal bands painted at the neck, FIG. 2.25 (MacGillivray 1984 #, 1 54 fig. 2).

Micaceous Buff amphora restoration. cate a Melian origin, as Davis has shown for a very simi- lar example from Kea (1986, 43, 108 U-73), though a similar type is found in Thera (Doumas 1983, 107 fig. 13d). Otherwise, the amphorae are of a type quite com- mon in Middle Helladic Greece (Buck 1964, 248 Type c5). Micaceous Brown 890 is a juglet in a gritty, brown, quite micaceous fab- ric, that resembles those of the central Cyclades, but the straight-sided form is unlike anything yet discov- ered in the islands. 973 is a large closed jar in a similar fabric but fired grey at the core. Micaceous Red 974 is fragments of an amphora of the same type as 1012-20, but in a gritty, red, very micaceous fabric. A Cycladic origin, perhaps Naxos or Syros, may be pos- tulated, although this is quite speculative until similar material is identified in the islands. x. Near Eastern Fabric 1021 is the fragments of more than one closed jar in a very distinctive soft and porous pink matrix, with fre- quent rounded sand-like grits. One fragment with a handle comes from a wheelmade jar, with a maximum diameter of roughly 25.0 cm (FIG. 2.26). The exterior has a thin pink engobe and traces of finely incised hori- zontal lines on the body. At the base of the handle three horizontal grooves are incised. The jars are much too fragmentary to be compared with Amiran's typology of North Syrian or 'Canaanite' jars (1969, 140-2 pl. 43), although they are unlikely to have come from angular forms. The incisions near the handle are reminiscent of those on similar jars from the Royal Tombs of Byblos (Tufnell 1969, 15). The Group N context suggests they were imported either late in MM II B or early in MM HI A, at the time Minoan pottery is found in some quantity in the Levant, see pp. 105-06. PART 4. SYNTHESIS There are 'archaeological' events at Knossos that can be linked to architectural periods. Trends in the arts, often reflected in pottery styles, by contrast cannot al- ways be linked to those events responsible for the pri- mary deposits so cherished by excavators. Nonetheless, the deposits can be used to monitor those changes in techniques and tastes across time that we treat as 'sty- listic development'. The boundaries are not firm. In- stead, they must be flexible enough to allow for the long- term popularity of some techniques, forms or designs, while admitting that others may be short-lived. The following conclusions isolate those wares, styles and forms described above within the periods of the Old Palace at Knossos, as first set out by Evans and largely re-affirmed by a century of Cretan excavations. The tables in FIGS. 2.27-30 chart the chronological distri- bution of the wares, styles and types described above. The aim here is to provide hypothetical 'type-fossils', to be used in comparison with other regions so that issues of influence, communication and chronology might be clarified and further tested as well as enhanced at Knossos. i. Diagnostic Pottery of the MM I A Period A number of wares, styles and types may be proposed as diagnostic of the MM I B period, because of their appearance in groups assigned to that stage of the pal- ace's history in Chapter 1 . However, as the line of argu- ment here is necessarily circular, given the lack of cer- tainty regarding their contexts, it is essential to em- phasize the validity of the stylistic evaluation as well as the stratigraphical. In order to do this, the pottery of the periods preceding MM I B needs to be examined, if only to be certain that none of the types classified as characteristic of MM I B are not, in fact, survivors from an earlier stage. Momigliano's re-investigation of the EM HI-MM I A pottery deposits from Knossos dismisses the in- stances of stratigraphy associated with MM I A levels, and in doing so may overlook important evidence for a stratigraphie definition of MM I B.

Chronological distribution of Fine Buff Crude Types. Pillar Basement, see above pp. 45-6. He assigned this earliest floor in the building to the MM I A period. Momigliano rejected this date, and even the floor's ex- istence, on the basis of comparisons with the material of the Old Palace period ( 1 99 1 , 1 63-6). The closest par- allels for the early polychrome pottery, however, are in the material from the upper floor level, reported in House B below the West Court. This was assigned by Pendlebury to a late stage of the MM I A period and used to illustrate the decorated pottery of that phase (1930, 60 pl. 14; 1939, 105 fig. 16). Here again Momigliano dismissed the significance of the upper level, because it could no longer be verified and paral- lels for the polychrome pottery, presented by Pendlebury, were said to be with the Old Palace pottery (199 1, 210-16). A third deposit, that found on the floor in House C below the West Court, was also assigned by Momigliano to the MM I A period even though it is stratified above an EM HI or early MM I A building, see above p. 23. In spite of the fact that the finds from these three areas have been mixed and cannot be verified at present, it is still possible to accept the statements made by Evans, Mackenzie and Pendlebury at the time of exca- vation, especially in view of the fact that much of the material they illustrate from these levels does not fit the stylistic definitions of either the early stages of MM I A or the MM I B period ceramics but may be seen to work as a stylistic bridge between the two. This study proposes to use the three groups mentioned above as a working definition of the ceramics of the late MM I A period, immediately preceding the foundation of the palace in MM I B (see also Cadogan et al. 1993, 25). The most secure pottery groups of the early MM I A period to emerge from Momigliano's study are those from the Upper East Well and the floor deposit in House A below the West Court. There are also vases specifi- cally said to come from the earlier floor in House B. Using these groups as representative of early MM I A ceramics, it becomes clear that much of the pottery found in the later deposits is very similar, and most likely represents close continuity or survivors from the ear- lier MM I A period. However, there are some features that show development toward the styles of MM I B. The most obvious example of development is the footed goblet from House B decorated with horizontal lines on the body and diagonal strokes on the rim in orange and white paint (Pendlebury and Pendlebury 1930, pl. 14.17), which Momigliano rejects as MM I A, and likens to MM I B Goblets of Type 1 (1991, 235-6 pl. 54.121). The goblet cited does not fit the MM I B typology, but is very similar in form and decoration to goblets from the lowest level in the Monolithic Pillar Basement (Mackenzie 1906, pl. 7.11-16). It might be seen best as representing a stage of development be- tween the footed goblets of early MM I A and those of the MM I B period and, given the contexts of the ex- amples, be placed in the late MM I A period. A new form in the late MM I A period is the wide, angular bridge-spouted jar, which is an obvious pred- ecessor to the MM I B Angular Bridge-spouted Jar of Type 1 (Momigliano 1991, 258-60 fig. 36 Types 2-4; Mackenzie 1906, pl. 9.14). The complete examples are often decorated with vertical lines, but one has a zone of barbotine work with fine ridges (Momigliano 1991, 179, 183 pl. 29.16), which is quite different from both the 'rockwork' barbotine of late MM I A and the 'prickle' barbotine of MM I B, but is very similar to that on one of the goblet fragments from the lowest level in the Monolithic Pillar Basement (Mackenzie 1906, 248-9 pl. 7-I3)- Many of the fragments of bridge-spouted jars from the Monolithic Pillar Basement and House B are deco- rated with patterns in orange and white that, following Mackenzie, might be termed the 'Polychrome Geomet- ric Style' (1906, 246). The overall compositions are defined by vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines, and triangles, lozenges and arches, filled with cross-hatch- ing, oblique strokes or dots, are the basic motifs. While there is rare (only two examples) use of polychrome decoration in early MM I A (Momigliano 1991, 265), there is no precedent for the full and somewhat com- plicated use in late MM I A. It is easily distinguished from the Pattern Painted Styles of the MM I B and MM II A periods, which employ abstract naturalistic motifs and rarely use dots or hatching to fill designs. The Polychrome Geometric Style, then, may be taken to represent a distinctive ceramic style of the late MM I A period. With this definition we may include the con- troversial jug and miniature bridge-spouted jar from</page><page sequence="93">94 POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES House C, above p. 23, the rim fragment of an angular jar from the North Quarter of the City (Momigliano 1 99 1, 180 pl. 31.36), and the fragments of jars and shal- low bowls from the Prepalatial Houses to the S of the Palace (ibid., 203-4 pl. 40. 14-18). The MM I A deposit beneath Vano XXV of the first palace at Phaistos may also be linked to this late stage of the period (Pernier 1935, 139-42 pl. XIV). At least one pot in this style was exported to Melos, where it may be one of the earliest Minoan artefacts at Phylakopi (Renfrew 1972, pl. 13. 4; Papagiannopoulou 1991, no. 383). This definition also embraces the dark burnished and incised pyxides and lids from various deposits at Knossos, which, on stratigraphie and stylistic grounds, may now be placed in the late stages of the MM I A period (MacGillivray, Day et al. 1987; Momigliano 1991, 172 n.117). Although the decoration on the pyxides is incised, it very closely reflects the geometric patterns, and use of dots and oblique strokes as filling devices, in the Polychrome Geometric Style. A comparison may also be made with the geometric designs and patterns on the contemporary pottery from Patrikies in the Mesara (Bonacasa 1968; Levi 1976, 747- 56 pl. Vili, 1). Illustrated with the polychrome pottery from House B are a few fragments decorated with abstract floral motifs, composed of a central dot surrounded by other dots of the same size or smaller (Pendlebury and Pendlebury 1930, pl. 14.3, 5, 13). These motifs are simi- lar to those employed in the Woven Style and it would be tempting to see them as an incipient version of the predominantly MM I B style, but the possibility that the level contains later material does not preclude their being examples of the later style. The same may be said of a fragment with white and orange naturalistic sprays, which are very similar to those on 74 (ibid., pl. 14. 1 and 7), and the rim fragments of two cups (ibid., pl. 14. 13 and 1 5). A cup from the late MM I A deposit near Building 6 at Archanes-Phourni (Sakellarakis 1972, pl. Ea; 1 99 1 1 01 fig. 74) comes very close to bridging the interval between the Polychrome Geometric and Wo- ven Styles, as may convex cup 69 in Group A. Although a much more detailed study is required, it is possible at present to suggest that the forms most likely to belong to the later part of the MM I A period are the wide footed goblet and wide, angular bridge- spouted jar; both have polychrome and a type of barbotine decoration. The most distinctive decorative style of the period is 'Polychrome Geometric', and 'ridged barbotine' patterns may also be characteristic. The full publication of the late MM I A group, from near Building 6 at Archanes-Phourni, should provide a wider range of forms and styles, as will the material from the lower floor in the Royal Road South Base- ments. This definition of the late MM I A period ceramics allows for the isolation of type-fossils for the MM I B period to be put forward with some confidence, although further detailed study of the MM I A period may alter the following list, particularly as regards some of the handmade forms which occur only in Group A. ii. Diagnostic Pottery of the MM I B Period The pottery associated with the earliest stages of the palace has some features, which are carried through from the late stages of MM I A, as might be expected. The fact that there is a close progression in styles, such as the Polychrome Geometric to the Woven and in some of the 'proto-wheelmade' forms found in the deposits that we take to mark the end of MM I B, indicates a short time span for the interval from the first construc- tion works in the palace, with which the Vat Room De- posit might be associated, to the events that caused the burnt deposit at the SW Palace Angle. The pottery most diagnostic of the end of MM I B is: Conical Goblets of Type 2, Tall-rimmed Angular Cups of Types 1-2 and Angular Bridge-spouted Jars of Type ib, in the Diagonal Red and White Style, and Straight-sided Cups of Types 2-3, Tall-rimmed An- gular Cups of Type ia, Shallow Angular Bowls of Type 1, Angular Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 2, Squat Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars and Rounded Bridge- spouted jars of Type 2 in the Woven Style. Also charac- teristic are the Jugs with Cut-away Spout of Type 1 and, perhaps, the Tall-rimmed Angular Cups of Types 1 to 3. Forms thrown on the radial centred potter's wheel first appear in some quantity during this period, in types such as the Straight-sided Cup of Types 4, 5-6, the Shallow Bowl of Type 2, the Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 3, the Short-rimmed Angular Cup of Types 1- 2, the Squat Rounded Cup, the Rounded Cup of Types 3-4, the Rounded Goblet of Types 2-3, and the Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar of Type 3. This may co- incide with the appearance of Evely's Type 2 wheelhead or bat made of fired clay found at Phaistos and Malia (1988, 89, 97-100 fig. 3). Additions and corrections to this definition should come with the publication of the groups from the S W Palace Angle, and the Royal Road South Basements - Middle Floor (Cadogan et al. 1993, 25). Hi. Diagnostic Pottery of the MM II A Period During the interval from the end of the MM I B period to the event, indicated by the burnt destruction depos- its in the Royal Pottery Stores and East Central En- clave, a great many innovations may be observed in the techniques and styles of the ceramics. The most appar- ent change is the widespread adoption of the radial cen- tred potter's wheel. Thrown pottery becomes the norm, especially in the case of small forms. With the technical change, came the confidence to experiment with new forms, the unprecedented and wide variety of which is particularly noticeable in the material in the North- West</page><page sequence="94">POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES 95 Pit. The Flywheel disc and collar, Evely's Type 3c, found in MM contexts at Malia, would have served the pur- pose well (1988, 90, 100-1). The most distinctive pottery in use at the time of the destruction is in Egg-shell Ware and Stamped and Im- pressed Ware using Rounded Cups of Type 3. Also di- agnostic are Conical Goblets of Type 3, Tumblers of Type 3, Tall-rimmed Angular Cups of Types 4-6, Pyxides of Types 1-5, Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Types 3-4 and Jugs with Horizontal Spout of Type 2. One of the most striking innovations is the intro- duction and apparently rapid and widespread adoption of the technique of 'throwing off the hump', to pro- duce the limited range of small utilitarian forms here called Crude Ware. Though many of the forms in Crude Ware first appear now, the Goblet and Type 2 Cup seem to belong only in MM II A. It should be possible to identify many more wares and styles, as the wealth and diversity of the ceramics from the North- West Pit demonstrates. For example, a 'polychrome reserved style' could be suggested for 203- 20, for which there is a corresponding style at Phaistos. The problem would be supporting such a stylistic ap- praisal with stratigraphie certainty, currently lacking at Knossos. iv. Diagnostic Pottery of the MM II B Period The pottery in use at the time of the destruction of the palace is not found in secure contexts within the build- ing. In order to construct the following summary it is necessary to rely on comparisons with material from primary destruction deposits in the town of Knossos, at Archanes and at Phaistos, and to accept that the event used to mark the end of the period, a violent earth- quake, was felt throughout central Crete. The wares and styles most diagnostic of the earth- quake horizon are: Precision Stamped Ware and the Sunrise, Starburst, Spiral Band and Wavy-line Styles used most frequently on Straight-sided Cups of Types 9-10, Rounded Cups of Types 5-6 and Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Types 4-5. Also characteristic are the Pyxis of Type 6 and Short-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 3. Many of the Crude types introduced in MM II A seem to continue, but Bowls of Types 1-4, Types 3-4 Cup and both Jug types appear to belong within this period. It is quite likely that Ridged Ware and the White- spotted and Heavy Spiral styles were introduced be- fore the end of MM II B, but they are more common in the next period. v. Diagnostic Pottery of the MM HI A Period As with the previous period, there are no pure MM IH A deposits from within the palace. The pottery in use immediately following the seismic event, that marks the end of the Old Palace period, is best understood from comparison with deposits in the town of Knossos and in the town and palace at Phaistos. The Knossian potters seem to have carried on pro- ducing the fine wares and styles, current at the end of the Old Palace period, for at least another generation, until the event responsible for forming the primary deposits in the Early Town Houses, Group P, and de- posits A and B in the Knossos Acropolis Houses. As the samples from the palaces of Knossos and Phaistos come from contexts associated with re-construction works, Groups E and N at Knossos and Vano 18 and 50 at Phaistos, it is hardly surprising that there be such close continuity from the end of MM II B. For exam- ple, Ridged Ware, White-spotted and Heavy Spiral styles form the bridge between the Old and New Pal- ace periods. New forms seem to be the Conical Rhyton, Straight-sided Cup of Type 13 and Jug with Horizon- tal Spout of Type 3. The Crude Types of MM II have given way to the distinctive conical cup and miniature forms of MM III and LM I. Perhaps the clearest indicator for the end of the MM HI A period is the 'everted rim bowl', absent in Groups E and N, but present at the Knossos Acropo- lis Houses and at Phaistos (Warren and Hankey 1989, 58). vi. The Passage of Time in Ceramics Terms There has been an attempt to link changes in pottery styles with the passage of time, by assuming that each generation will produce its own style and this will be an 'improvement' upon the last (Popham 1990). Cau- tion must be exercised, when attributing a chronologi- cal value to stylistic change. Significant changes in ce- ramic production and design could be placed in an evo- lutionary model, and used to indicate a long interval between archaeological events. The same innovations could equally signify an influx of new ideas and populations, reflecting a very short interval, during which new styles and techniques quickly dominate and force the abandonment of previous trends, thereby end- ing their development. We are limited to what we see. For example, the Polychrome Geometric Style of the late MM I A period may be viewed, on the basis of mo- tifs, paint and forms, as a close predecessor for the Wo- ven Style popular in the MM I B destruction deposits, and so we might suppose a short period of unbroken progression. Whereas the designs and forms of the MM II A deposits seem quite far removed from those of MM I B. For example, the appearance of Fine Buff Crude pottery and the widespread adoption of the radial cen- tred potter's wheel (used to make such fine ceramics as the Egg-shell Ware, characteristic of the MM II A de- struction deposits) could indicate a long interval be- tween major events in the palace. Equally valid, how- ever, would be the suggestion that the innovations were</page><page sequence="95">9Ó POTTERY FABRICS, WARES AND STYLES the result of a rapid influx of new technologies, in this case from Egypt. In contrast, some of the MM II B wares, for example Precision Stamped and Late Printed, may be regarded as the next generation along from the Stamped and Impressed and Early Printed wares of MM II A. This is particularly clear when comparing the motifs on cups 624-6 of MM II A with MM II B cups 293-8. This short interval may be the reason for the continuation of some of the Crude Types, without perceptible change, from MM II A to the end of MM II B, for example: the Bowls of Types 2 and 3, the pyxides, the Cups of Type 1 and the Juglet. Likewise, the interval between the end of MM II B and the end of MM HI A may have been short, as there is little change in the Ridged Ware and Precision Grooved Ware of both periods and the White-spotted and Heavy Spiral styles could also indicate a short period of unbroken stylistic development. The interval that sees the greatest innovation in ce- ramic technique and design is the MM II A period. A detailed study of the pottery from the North- West Pit could show specific stages within the period, though without the stratigraphie framework necessary to con- firm hypotheses that must remain stylistic. The North- West Pit could have held a gradual accumulation of de- bris, withdrawn from use over time, and so could rep- resent a long interval. A similar situation was indicated by a series of well-stratified trodden earth surfaces on the N façade of Building 7 at Palaikastro, also of the MM II A period and most likely indicating a long un- broken interval at Palaikastro (MacGillivray, Sackett et al, 1992, 133).</page><page sequence="96">3 Historical implications INTRODUCTION As histories tend to be written around major events, so too does this historical chronology of the MBA in cen- tral Crete; although in this case the 'events' are archaeo- logical, that is, significant changes as observed and evaluated by the analysis of physical remains. The changes we observe in the archaeological record are dif- ficult to associate, with confidence, to social and/or po- litical change. For example seismic activity of such in- tensity as to bring down a village, may have had little long-term effect upon the village's inhabitants, or, con- versely, could have brought about significant reaction and change. The physical evidence may record a major architectural change, while the indicators of social change, for example burial, ritual practice, choice of styles etc. may seem unaffected. Nonetheless, my duty here is to establish a framework, within which to dis- cuss the more complex issues of Cretan society at the time of the first palaces. The focus is on published sites in N central Crete and their relation to Knossos. I have decided not to include Kommos, Malia and sites to the E and W of the island, as the complexities of their local styles and stratigraphy are much better left in the hands of others. Andreou (1978), Betancourt (1990), Cadogan (19780; 1990), Godart and Tzedakis (1992), Poursat (1987), Stürmer (1992), and Walberg (1983) have be- gun the task of forming the stylistic and chronological relationships, necessary to construct the larger image of Proto-palatial Crete. PART 1 . EVENTS IN THE EARLY PALACE AND TOWN AT KNOSSOS Evans imagined that the architects for the Palace of Minos shaved off the tell, that had formed at the site over centuries of occupation, presumably having evacu- ated the town's occupants and destroyed their dwell- ings. Manteli and Evely observe that there was a thin layer of white material scattered over the top of the neolithic levels, perhaps associated with the first build- ing operations in the area of the Throne Room (1995, 2-3). We might suggest the purely functional 'build- er's plaster' as an explanation, but equally valid would be a process or ceremony to consecrate or purify the ground surface, prior to the construction of an impor- tant monument. Stylistically, the earliest groups within the palace are the Vat Room Deposit and the similar deposit set in the floor beneath West Magazine 1 . Although neither con- text is well defined, they may be foundation deposits set in position after the end of the MM I A period, as marked by the destruction deposits on the latest floors in West Court Houses B (upper floor) and C, both with pottery in the Polychrome Geometric Style of the late MM I A period. The earliest architectural element to be incorporated into the palace is the NW Angle, the support wall of which was built during the EM HI period (MacGillivray 1994)- The description of the Gypsades cistern and pits as repositories, into which pottery was placed at one time, is reminiscent of the Early Chamber beneath the West Court (Group A), Hogarth's Early Heap in the Town and Wardle's deposit N of the Villa Ariadne. The re- positories in the town could have been used as Hogarth suggested and may have contained material from de- struction deposits, such as those at the SW Palace An- gle, the Room of the Jars in the Royal Pottery Stores (Group I), the vases in the Town Drain (Group O). Other contexts, which might be taken as fill of this pe- riod, are the material from the floor at 3.00 m in the Monolithic Pillar Basement (Group M) and the mid- dle floor in the Royal Road S Basements. All certainly suggest an event in the site's history, though the nature of the event is far from clear. Nor is it obvious that a single event is represented. Nonetheless, these contexts have been grouped together here on the basis of ce- ramic parallels, to form a general picture of the pottery at the end of the MM I B period. The presence of MM I B pottery beneath West Maga- zine 1, at the SW Angle, in the Vat Room Area, in the buildings of the Royal Pottery Stores and in the mate- rial from the Early Olive Press floor, seems to indicate that most, if not all, of the architectural elements that make up the W and E wings of the palace existed by the end of MM IB. A significant event in the palace's history is indicated by burnt deposits in W Magazine 2, the Royal Pottery Stores, and the Early Olive Press floor. Similar events in Early S W House 1 and the NW Treasure House may</page><page sequence="97">98 HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS be related and help to define a picture of general con- flagration, that is taken to mark the end of the MM II A period. Evans interpreted the presence of huge blocks from the SE Palace Angle in the House of the Fallen Blocks, and a similar stretch of fallen wall along the line of the South Enceinte, as firm proof of a seismic event of such destructive power, as to require the subsequent rebuild- ing of much of the palace. The process of cleaning and rebuilding effectively obscured the deposits that might have been formed by the event; but it created a number of contexts in and around the palace, where the debris, from the fallen structures and their contents, might be disposed of and used to level off areas for the next build- ing stage. This would account for the filling in the Loomweight Basement and the West and South Poly- chrome deposits. The appearance of pottery in use at the time of the seismic event is best seen in small groups formed in the town, at Trial KV and SEX F/FG, but also at Anemospilia near Archanes and especially in the major floor deposits at Phaistos. The reconstruction following the earthquake, taken to mark the end of the MM II B period, represents the beginning of the neopalatial period, during which the palace at Knossos sees a large number of architectural innovations. Soon into this first stage of the rebuild- ing, there is evidence in the town for an event responsi- ble for creating the primary floor deposits in the Town Houses (Group P) and Acropolis Houses deposit A and the re-deposited context of Hogarth's Later Heap. The event is used here to mark the end of the MM HI A period and set quite soon, within a generation, of the end of the Old Palace period.

Juktas, have demonstrated that there was activity in the area during the MM I A period (1978, 232 pl. 160a). In 1978, she discovered a deposit of fill from the upper terrace, or Terrace I, quite near the 'Chasm' (1978, 247-9; 1981^). While the excavator argues that the earliest pottery is a mixture of MM I A, MM I B and MM II styles, it could equally be suggested, through comparison with Knossos Group A and related material, that the published Juktas pottery could be of one date, the MM I B period. This is indicated by the presence of Angular Bridge-spouted Jars of Types 1 and 2 in the Woven Style of Pattern Painted Ware (1978, figs. 11. 6, 7; 12. 4), and Shallow Grooved Ware (ibid., fig. 1 1 . 2). Even the presence of a cup of MM I A type (ibid., fig. 11. 2) need not be a problem as these seem to continue in use, if not manu- facture, into the MM I B period at Knossos, for exam- ple 145 in Group A. This would indicate that the con- struction of the terrace should coincide roughly with the foundation of the palaces at Knossos and Phaistos. The establishment of the building around the early ter- race and chasm seems to have taken place at the end of MM II - III, according to the results of trials in 1988, and thus belongs to the neopalatial period (Tomlinson 1995,60). ii. Archanes Phourni The low hill at Phourni, immediately N of Juktas, was used for funerary practices from EM II to the end of the Bronze Age. There seem not to have been any pri- mary inhumations during the Old Palace period, but there is one context that seems to have been formed early in the period and remained undisturbed. A deposit comprising hundreds of small vases was found between Funerary Building 6 and the W outer wall of Tholos B (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1972). The pot- tery had been re-deposited, perhaps from the predeces- sor to Tholos B, Funerary Building 7 of the MM I A period. While some of the forms may be from the MM I A period, a small number of pieces, including a Tum- bler of Type 1 (ibid., pl. 2a), a Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 1 (ibid., pl. 5b), and a Straight-sided Cup of Type 2 in the Woven Style (ibid., pl. 5a) may provide a terminus post quern in the MM I B period, perhaps ear- lier than the groups taken to mark the end of the period at Knossos. Anemospilia The remains of a finely built structure, on the spur called Anemospilia on the N slopes of Juktas adjacent to a cluster of eroded rock shelters from which it takes its name, were cleared in 1979 (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1979, 1 98 1, 1 991). The building seems to have been destroyed at one time and not rebuilt, thereby leaving a very useful collection of finds in primary contexts. Among the types and styles linked to Knossos are a Rounded Cup of Type 6 in the Wavy-line Style (J. and E. Sakellarakis 1979, pl. 183b; 1991, 144 fig. 120), ajug with Cut-away Spout of Type 4 (ibid., pl. 183), a Crude Juglet (ibid., pl. 183), a jug of the same type as 566 in Group E decorated in the Closed Heavy Spiral Style (ibid., 1979, pl. 183; 1991, fig. 120), and a large jug, with abstract floral motif painted opposite the handle, quite similar in form and decoration to 583-4 in Group E (ibid., 1991 fig. 120). There can be little doubt that the primary deposits in the structure at Anemospilia were sealed by an event best explained as seismic. The excavators are quite clear in their reconstruction of events (ibid., 1981). The choice of contemporary events at neighboring Knossos and Phaistos is limited to two: the seismic event at the end of the MM II B period, and the event responsible for the primary contexts that mark the end of the MM IH A period. The effects of an earthquake, observed at Knossos by Evans and at Phaistos by La Rosa, makes a strong case for the events at all three sites to be related in origin, and exactly contemporary. Given the very close similarity of the pottery with that of Groups E and N at Knossos and period 3 at Phaistos, there is a very strong likelihood that the primary deposits at Anemospilia were created at the end of the MM II B period, as suggested by the excavators. Hi. Gournes Hatzidakis cleared what he regarded as a funerary struc- ture at the coastal site of Gournes to the E of Knossos in 1 9 14 (191 5). The detailed publication of the pottery by Zois allows for a series of close correspondences with the pottery of Knossos to be observed (1969, 2-24). There are several pieces that belong in the MM I A pe- riod, for example a group of footed goblets with a type of barbotine decoration (ibid., nos. 7008-9) and a coni- cal goblet in the Polychrome Geometric Style (ibid., no. 7010). A group of juglets is very similar to exam- ples in the Vat Room Deposit (ibid., pls. 1-4; Momigliano 1991, no. 16) and thus early MM I B, but the latest pottery includes a Straight-sided Cup of Type 2 in the Woven Style (ibid., no. 7014a), Convex-sided Cups (ibid., pl. 34 nos. 7015, 7046), and Tall-rimmed Angular Cups of Type 1 (ibid., pl. 28 no. 7015) and Type 3 (ibid., nos. 7012-4), all forms found in the groups that mark the end of the MM I B period at Knossos. PART 3. PHAISTOS The stratigraphie sequence at Phaistos has been the subject of a great deal of discussion since Doro Levi's excavations of the 1950's produced a new wing of the</page><page sequence="99">1 00 HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS Old Palace (Levi 1976; 1980; Levi and Carinci 1988). Levi's synthesis of the results suggested an historical sequence, quite different to that proposed by Evans for Knossos and Pernier for the previous excavations at Phaistos (Levi i960). The debate which followed Levi's proposal questioned the contents of some of his peri- ods (Fiandra 1962; 1980; Zois 1965; Platon 1968; War- ren and Hankey 1989, 47-9). The result is that there are two alternative systems of periods to distinguish the four major sequential phases of the MM period at Phaistos: that of the excavator, who calls his periods la, Ib, II and III, and that of the excavation architect who calls her periods 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Fiandra 1962). Unfortu- nately, the two systems are not compatible. As in Zois' and Warren and Hankey's, so in the present study the periods and their definitions as set forth by Fiandra are recognized as the most convincing for the Phaistos stratigraphy, and also the most relevant for the com- parative material from Knossos and N central Crete. The following definitions are based on the regrouping of stratified deposits, as given in prelimi- nary reports and listed by Levi and Carinci (1988, 353- 79) and Fiandra (1962; 1980). The contexts are arranged in chronological order in FIG. 3.2. The resulting archi- tectural phasing seems to conform with the architec- tural and stylistic periods as originally set forth by Pernier. Therefore, it has been necessary to ignore most of Levi's stylistic groupings (1976), as these are seen to conflict with the stratigraphie evidence. MM I A Pernier illustrates material from below the pavement in Vano XXV including a jug, juglet and the head of a terracotta figurine painted in tones very similar to those of the Knossos Polychrome Geometric Style (Pernier 1935, 139-42 pls. XIV, XV), and a jar from below the pavement in Vano XII (ibid., pl. XIII). He also illus- trates a number of vases of similar date from a variety of locations generally given as below the floor levels of the palace (ibid., 133-8, figs. 58-9, pl. XIII). His con- clusion that the material is from contexts earlier than the palace is significant, as it gives a terminus post quern for the building's construction, confirmed by Fiandra. The group of pottery from Patrikies near Phaistos provides a wider variety of MM I A forms than is avail- able from the palace deposits (Bonacasa 1968; Levi 1976, 747-56). Though the predominant form, the teapot, is rare outside of the Mesara, the decoration is closely related to the Polychrome Geometric Style of late MM I A at Knossos (Levi 1976, pl. VII i, 1). Evans and Pernier had agreed on the MM I A date for the latest material Fig. 3.2. Chronological chart of main Middle Mino an groups at Phaistos.

We may now place it close to the end of the period, when the Poly- chrome Geometric Style was popular at Knossos. Period 1 The beginning of Period 1 is marked by the construc- tion of the South- West Block of the First Palace. Two groups may assigned to this early phase. The first is sherd material from the foundation trench for the Façade (Fiandra 1962, 1 14-15, 117 pl. 19). In- cluded are at least six examples of Barbotine Ware, two fragments of teapots, the shoulder of a closed vessel with remains of circular patterns (similar to F 21 71 from the Period 1 floor in Vano LXV, belonging to a later stage of this period), and a sherd in Early Printed Ware with white S motifs on a dark ground (ibid., pl. 19 top left). The second is the contents of a chest, set into the floor of Vano 1 1 , perhaps as a foundation deposit, that pre-dates the main Period 2 destruction deposit strati- fied above it (Levi 1976, 363-4). The whole vases in- clude two rounded bridge-spouted jars with horizontal barbotine decoration (F 61, 62), a spouted cup with similar decoration (F 353), a rounded bridge-spouted jar in Early Printed Ware, with an S-pattern in white on the shoulder (F 361), and a straight-sided cup simi- lar to Knossos Type 2 (F 362). The painted dot medal- lion opposite the spout on F 62 is quite similar to the motif as employed in the Woven Style at Knossos, see above p. 59; FIGS. 2.2 (3); 2.3 (2). Also belonging to this period, but apparently later, are the earliest deposits in Vani IC, C, CI and CHI in the houses W of the W Court (Levi 1976, 537-55). Pot- tery includes examples in Early Printed Ware (F 5479a), Polychrome Reserved Style (F 5330, 5957c) and in a style closely related to Knossian Woven Style (F 5474, 5482, 5939, 5946). A mature stage of Period 1 may be represented by a destruction deposit on the earliest floor in Vano LXV. The pottery includes examples in Barbotine Ware (E 21 16, 2169, 2170) and an example of Early Printed Ware (F 2175) very similar to Knossos 632 in Group E Fiandra's definition of Period 1 generally conforms to Levi's phase la. A detailed re-examination should make it possible to subdivide the pottery further into early and late wares and styles. Examples from the early stage are closely related to Group A at Knossos and should be regarded as contemporary. Fiandra assigned this material to the MM I B period, as Evans had done for Group A at Knossos. The present study agrees that this period be taken to mark the beginning of the Old Palace period at both sites, and, as the pottery may be distinguished from that of the previous MM I A period and develops without break into MM II A wares and styles (in particular the Printed Ware and Woven Styles), that it continue to be called MM I B. There is no reason why Phaistos Period 1 and Knossos MM I B should be co-terminous, but, until the recently excavated Knossian deposits are fully published and compared with those from Phaistos, it seems most convenient to regard the periods as largely contemporary. Period 2 The end of the second period is defined by the burnt destruction deposits in the early rooms beneath the S W façade of the New Palace in Vani io, 11 and 25; the floors assigned by Levi to his phase Ib in the area of Vani IL, LI-LV, LXV. Also to the period belongs the material from the drain beneath Vani LIX, LX and LXIV, stratified beneath floor deposits of Period 3, the contents of the bench in Vani LXIII, and a group of floor deposits in the houses W of the W Court in Vani LXXXI, LXXXIH-XCV, XCVII-CI and CII-CIH. Many of the pottery parallels between Phaistos and Knossos are cited in the descriptions of the wares and styles in Chapter 2. They are far too numerous to be repeated here in detail. For example, the deposit in Vano 1 1 includes Rounded Bridge-spouted jars of Type 4 (F 414, 415, 428), one which is decorated with the eight- petalled rosette motif of Knossos Cup 617, an angular cup in Shallow Grooved Ware (E 397), a cup in Early Printed Ware (F 418), a Tall-rimmed Angular Cup of Type 1 (E 400), a Pedestalled Lamp of Type 1 (F 381), and an angular cup decorated in stone-like veins (F 396) very similar to Knossos jar 246. In general, the pottery is most similar to that of the Royal Pottery Stores, Groups F-H, and Early Olive Press Floor, Group L, at Knossos. Fiandra used this material to define the ce- ramics of the MM II A period (1980), as Evans had done at Knossos. The present study proposes that it be taken to mark the end of the period. Fiandra places the construction of the N block of the W Wing of the Old Palace to this period and vases pub- lished by Pernier from below Vano XXVII (1935 pl. 16 a, b), Vano XXIV (ibid., pl. 21b) and Vano XI (ibid., pl. 24b) tend to confirm this. The end of this period at both Phaistos and Knossos is marked by burnt destruction deposits which pre- served sealings and tablets in the Hieroglyphic and Lin- ear A scripts at both palaces. The pottery styles from both sites are so similar as to suggest that the events were contemporary. Period j The end of the third period is marked by a severe de- struction in both blocks of the W Wing, which left up- per and lower floor deposits in situ in almost all of the rooms. As Levi had separated these into two periods, Ib and II, it is necessary to combine many of his groups in the S block in order to gain a full understanding of the ceramics in use at the time of the destruction (War- ren and Hankey 1989, 47-8). Deposits are in the Corridoio LIII-LV and Sottoscale LI, LUI, LIV, LV, LVI, LVII, LVIII, LIX, LX, LXIV The NW corner rooms, V-VH, were added to the N block</page><page sequence="101">1 02 HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS of the W Wing during this period and, like the other rooms in the block and under the Grand Staircase, XXXIV, contained destruction deposits. To the SW of the palace, deposits were found in XXVH-XXVIH, XLVII, LXVII and LXVIII. In many areas a layer of 'calcestruzzo' was laid over the levelled debris, apparently at one time but at differ- ing absolute heights (Fiandra 1980, 170-6; Warren and Hankey 1989, 47). The pottery from this final destruction horizon of the Old Palace at Phaistos provides the most compre- hensive definition of central Cretan ceramics at the close of the Old Palace period. Fiandra, following Evans, placed the destruction at the end of the MM II B pe- riod (1962). Comparanda from the palace at Knossos are quite numerous and cited, with the wares and styles, in Chapter 2. They are from deposits formed in the palace during the event and early in the subsequent period, Groups E, K and N, and are thus a mixture of MM II B and MM III A wares and styles. However, the destruction deposit in Trial KV and the contents of the pit in Tomb XVII at Mavrospilio, though meagre, con- firm Fiandra's dating to the MM II B period. Period 4 Fiandra's Period 4 is roughly equivalent to Levi's phase III which comprises the whole of the MM III period and, because it includes material from the Kamilari tholos, extends into LM III. To an early stage of the period may be assigned the small deposit, formed dur- ing the earliest stages of the re-building of the palace in Vano 18 (Levi 1976, 374-7 fig. 586; Carinci 1989, 78). The pottery includes Straight-sided Cups like Knossos Types 8 and 10, decorated in the Spiral Band Style (F 367, 373, 375), a Rounded Cup like Type 5, in the Heavy Spiral Style (F 354) and another cup in the same style (F 387). To this early stage of the period may also be assigned the votive or foundation deposit beneath Vano 50 (Levi 1976, 405-8 figs. 623-30). The pottery includes four Straight-sided Cups like Types 8 and 10, deco- rated in the Spiral Band Style (E 7O7a-d) and a rounded cup like Type 5 in the Heavy Spiral Style (F. 490). The Heavy Spiral Style at Knossos is placed late in the MM II B period and early in MM HI A, see above p. 64; a conclusion supported by its appearance in pri- mary deposits, after the events that mark the end of the Old Palace at Phaistos. The early neopalatial building, S of the W Court, may have come into existence during this period and the floor deposits in Vani LXXXVI and LXXXVII may be earlier than those in the other rooms, which con- tained pottery of the MM HI B period (Levi 1976, 489). The comparanda at Knossos for the pottery from the early stages of this period come from the mixed groups of fill, deposited after the destruction of the Old Palace, Groups E and N, but also from the Early Town Houses, Group P, Hogarth's Heap, and the earliest de- posits, A and B, in the Acropolis Houses, which con- form to Evans' definition of the ceramics of the MM IH A period. This period, then, is very similar in its composition and nature at both sites. The pottery may be distin- guished from the well-known styles of the MM III B period, best illustrated by Deposit C in the Acropolis Houses at Knossos (Catling et al. 1979, 34-9) and the floor deposits in Rooms LXXXIX-XCHI of the house S of the W Court at Phaistos. It is proposed here to retain Evans' designation of MM III A, at both Phaistos and Knossos, to comprise the first stage of re-building following what appears to have been a seismic event in central Crete. The nature of the event that marks the horizon be- tween periods 3 and 4 has been clarified further, in re- cent excavations by La Rosa, who has found traces of a seismic destruction at Phaistos (Tomlinson 1995, 63). This would conform with the evidence from Anemospilia and Knossos and contribute to the hypoth- esis of an earthquake at the end of the MM II B period. PART 4. EGYPT AND THE LEVANT i. Chronology and History of Egypt in the Middle Kingdom The complexities of Egyptian chronology have all but obscured the field in recent years, for scholars reliant on the Egyptian accession dates for the stability of other chronologies. We have arrived at a time when we must decide to support the most convincing argument for the moment, accept a series of dates, and write history to the best of our ability, with the understanding that it could be overturned by the time it goes to press. I have decided to use Kitchen's 'best' dates (1989, 152-3; in press), which have become the most commonly used by Aegean scholars (Warren and Hankey 1989; Warren 1995; Kuhrt 1995, 161). As Kitchen's dates are revised, so too must those employed here. The XI th Dynasty lasts the 143 years from 21 16 to 1973 BC and seems to correspond largely with the MM I A period (Warren and Hankey 1989, 128-30). The XII th Dynasty kings built for their capital the fortress city in the neighbourhood of modern Lisht at Itht-toui, 'The Controller of the Two Lands', between Herakleiopolis and Memphis. The dynasty begins with the accession of Amenemhat in 1973 who ruled until his death in 1944. The last nine years of his reign were shared with his son, Senusret - the Greek Sesostris - who ruled 1 953-1 908. The last three years of his 45 year reign were shared with his son Amenemhat II, who acceded to the throne in 191 1. Amenemhat IPs 35 year reign ended with his death in 1876. His successor, Senusret II became co-regent with his father in 1878 and ruled for 6 years until 1872. On his death, Senusret HI ruled for 19 years until 1853. With his death came</page><page sequence="102">HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS 1 03 the ascendancy of Amenemhat HI, whose 45 year reign marked a high point in the stability of the Xllth Dy- nasty's rule. He was succeeded in 1808 by Amenemhat IV who ruled for 9 years until his death in 1799. Sobeknefru's reign of 4 years ending in 1795 concludes the Xllth Dynasty. What follows in the Xlllth Dynasty is a different kind of administration without the strength of one long rule, but rather a time of internal struggle for power lasting a minimum of 1 50 years from 1795 to 1638 BC, when the Hyksos occupied the Delta. The Egyptian government certainly continued to operate, but the impression is one of a withdrawal from the Delta with consolidation and enlargement at Lisht after roughly 1650/40 BC (Quirke 1991, 123), until Ahmose conquered Avaris over a century later in 1 540 and be- gan the re-unification of the country under the XVIIIth Dynasty. it. Minoica in Egypt The discovery of 'Aegean' pottery by Pétrie in 1 889 and 1890 at Kahun provided one of the most reliable his- torical links between the early Aegean cultures and Egypt even before the Bronze Age Cretans had been re-discovered (Pétrie 1891). The resulting chronologi- cal impact has been the subject of a great deal of de- bate, as the historical sequence for the Aegean Bronze Age continues to rely heavily on links between the Cre- tans and their eastern neighbours. The comprehensive publication of Minoan pottery in Egypt by Kemp and Merrillees (1980) remains the most useful source, as it reviews find contexts and very much facilitates com- parison with the Cretan material. In the following brief re-appraisal of the chronological value of the Cretan exports in Egypt, reference is made to their numbering system wherever possible. Qubbet el-Hawa The small, handmade jug, found with a group of dis- turbed material in a secondary use of shaft IV in Tomb 88 at Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan, is unique in some respects, but has features that allow it to be placed with a great deal of confidence in the early part of the Cre- tan MBA (Edel in Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 176-219). The jug's overall shape has no close parallels, but the foot is quite similar to those on the Tall-rimmed An- gular Cup Type ib, Rounded Cup of Type ib, Shallow Angular Bowl of Type 1 and Angular Bridge-spouted Jar of Type ib, all handmade forms of the MM I B pe- riod at Knossos, though the piece is almost certainly not from Knossos. The decoration belongs to the very characteristic Alternating Red and White Floral Style of E Crete (Cadogan 1983, 515-16; 1990, 172-4; 1994, 65-6), a close parallel to the decoration is found on a tumbler like Knossos Type 1 from Malia (Demargne 1945, pl. IX no. 8658; Cadogan 1983, 516). The plastic flowers may be placed within a 'Plastic Style' of Palaikastro, though birds and animals are more com- mon embellishments (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 12, pls. VI. D, VII). The E Cretan style is contemporary with MM I B-II A at Knossos (MacGillivray and Driessen 1990, 398), and so, it seems, should be the Qubbet el-Hawa jug. The material found with the jug is largely early Middle Kingdom in date (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 217-19), though the latest finds sug- gest a date early in the XHth Dynasty providing for a likely overlap between the MM I B period and the early Xllth Dynasty (Warren and Hankey 1989, 130). Haraga - Cemetery B Tomb 326 at Haraga contained a number of Egyptian pots including two crinkle rim bowls/cups interpreted as local imitations of Minoan pots (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 36-9 fig. 17 Ha. 13, 14). If the cups imitate Cre- tan originals, the prototypes would belong to the ear- lier part of the Old Palace period and it is more likely that they would be from E Crete than the centre; as for example the silver cups from Gournia House Tomb I (Boyd-Hawes et al. 1908, pl. C. 1-3). Davis assigns the Cretan cups to the MM I B period (1979, 37). El Tôd The 153 silver vessels in copper chests bearing the cartouche of Amenemhat II, found at El Tod in 1936, have been compared with Minoan ceramics since their discovery and publication (Bisson de la Roque et al. 1953). The variety of opinion generated may reflect the variety of sources for a collection of vessels and other objects gathered together late in the king's reign, as Porada suggested (1982), recently revised by Maxwell- Hyslop (1995). The date of the context has been dis- puted, but Lilyquist has presented a convincing case for the integrity of its XHth Dynasty deposition (1993). Warren (1980, 495-6) and Warren and Hankey (1989, 13 1-5) summarize the conflicting views, and present a detailed and convincing argument both for a Minoan origin for some of the metalware and for a sound chrono- logical correspondence. The Cretan ceramic examples they cite for the cups, however, are similar to Rounded Cups of Type 5 (ibid. 1989, pl. 5A, C). A more con- vincing parallel might be the Squat Rounded Cups of Type 1. The similarity between Tôd 70580, 70583 and 22, 44 and 45 suggests a chronological link for the sil- ver cups with the end of the MM I B period. The verti- cal arcades on 70593, 70604-5, and rosette patterns on 70623, 70627, 70629 and 70630, however, are quite likely to have inspired the impressed and painted patterns on Egg-shell Ware cups of the MM II A period, for exam- ple 616, 617 and examples cited by Warren and Hankey (1989, 132-5), and so should be contemporary with a stage of MM II A. Some of the silver jewellery and ingots have been shown to originate in the N Aegean, as they conform with the Thasos - Chalkidiki or Troadic fields as de- fined by lead isotope analysis (Menu 1994). Two of the</page><page sequence="103">1 04 HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS cups analysed, however, are not made of silver from the same source and seem to lie outside the known fields, perhaps due to the alloying or mixing of metals from a variety of sources. As there is no source of silver in Crete, the expectation of Aegean scholars has been that Siphnos or the Laurion would have been the likely source for Cretan metal smiths. Matsas' discovery of a Minoan roundel and nodule at Mikro Vouni in Samothrace has done much to alter previous expecta- tions, and provide the firm administrative evidence to support the conclusions of the lead isotope analysis (1991; 1995). They certainly prove that Cretans were active in the N Aegean. The Mikro Vouni documents were associated with material similar to the early sub- period of Troy VI and Matsas proposed a date in late MM II (199 1 ) revised to MM II B- III A (1995). The first published C-14 dates of 2030-1785 and 2030-1876 BC, for bone samples associated with the roundel, may seem early (ibid. 1991, 168). In fact, the second date fits quite well with Kitchen's dates for the reign of Amenemhat II, the exact time that the silver used to create the ingots and bracelets in the Tôd treasure was probably produced and shipped south; this conforms well with a stylistic link between the Tôd cups and Knossian pottery in MM I B and MM II A. The sec- ond set of dates, however, bring the Minoan documents down to c. 1750 BC and beyond the date of Amenemhat II. Lisht Excavations on the W side of the N of the two pyramids at el-Lisht, that of Amenemhat I, produced a number of Minoan sherds from a fill context, that unfortunately cannot be placed with more precision than from the early Xllth to the late XIHth Dynasty (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 5-6). Among the published pottery are a few pieces, for which close parallels may be cited. Li. 1 is part of a handmade composite vase without close parallels in central Crete, but very much at home in the Alternating Red and White Floral Style of E Crete (Cadogan 1983, 515-16; 1990, 172-4; 1994, 65-6), as with the Qubbet el-Hawa jug, above. The upright branch pattern is quite close to that on a MM I B cup from Gournia (Boyd-Hawes et al. 1908, pl. C3), and so the vase's manufacture was probably during the MM I B period in E Crete. Li. 3 is the handle of a rounded bridge-spouted jar of uncertain type. The type of handle, though, is un- likely to be earlier than the MM I B period and, given its similarity to the handles on Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Types 4 and 5, most likely to belong within the MM II period. Kemp and Merrillees point out the likelihood that a seventh sherd, not in their inventory, could be Cretan (1980, 4 pl. 3 middle row, second from right). If so, it finds a close parallel in the decoration of Rounded Cup Type 3, 645, from the MM II A context of Group F. The Minoan pottery from Lisht, therefore, was manufactured during the MM I B and MM II A peri- ods and may have arrived at the site over a period of several generations. Kahun The majority of the twenty sherds of Minoan pottery from Kahun comes from a dump, near the big houses on the N part of the site (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 82-90). A recent analysis of the Kahun sherds in the BM has shown that most were probably manufactured in the same workshops, producing the fine wares for Phaistos and the Mesara (Fitton et al. 1999). The chemical re- sults, though at first surprising, may be confirmed by the following stylistic comparison with pottery from Phaistos and Knossos. Among the numerous fragments of Middle Minoan pottery in Pattern Painted Ware said to be from Kahun are fragments of Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars (Ka. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 1 1). The two most complete, Ka. 1 and 2, are closest in form to jars of Type 4 at Knossos, typical of the destruction deposits at the end of the MM II A period. The decoration on Ka. 1 very closely resembles that on 250 and the two could well be the products of the same workshop. The decoration of a sharp pointed petalled rosette on Ka. 2 is not common at Knossos, but very much a feature of Phaistos Period 2. Ka.6 and 7 are the spouts of 'teapots'; a form not known at Knossos, but quite common at Phaistos (Levi and Carinci 1988, pls. 44-6, e.g., F. 4789, 6187). The white painted pattern of a tiny dot rosette on Ka. 6 is one most often encountered on pottery of the MM II A pe- riod at Knossos, for example 655, 942-6, 994, but is also quite common at Phaistos, the source of the exam- ples above (Fitton et al 1999). The one fragment that may be Knossian, straight- sided cup Ka. 17, is quite similar in form and decora- tion to 637 in the MM II A Group F. Kemp and Merrillees (1980, 87) point out that Kahun became prosperous, because it was well situated for the increased commerce with the Fayum, at a time when it was being developed for agriculture by the Xllth Dy- nasty kings. It has been suggested that the most likely time for the importation of the Minoan pots would have been during the town's floruit in the reign of Amenemhat III or soon thereafter (Fitton et al. 1999). A MM sherd from N Karnak, said to be from a Middle Kingdom level and compared to those from Kahun, may also belong to this period (Jacquet-Gordon 1991, 29). Haraga Excavations in the Middle Kingdom cemetery site at Haraga during the winter of 1913/ 14 produced about 20 fragments of MM pottery (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 6-14). The fragments were found in debris in the area of cemeteries C, C2 and C3. The main bulk of</page><page sequence="104">HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS 1 05 the graves in the Haraga cemeteries date to the second half of the Xllth Dynasty and there has been a ten- dency to associate the imported ceramics with those from Kahun and link the notion of Aegean workers in the town with 'their' pottery (Evans 1928, 210). Among the sherds some are comparable to known types in Crete: Ha. 4 is a body fragment of Barbotine Ware, quite common in Crete in the MM I B period, but probably still produced in MM II A at Knossos. Ha. 5 may be the shoulder of a bridge-spouted jar in Stamped and Impressed Ware of the MM II A period at Knossos. Ha. 1 6 is a body fragment of a rounded bridge- spouted jar from just below the spout. Although the type cannot be ascertained, the decoration is quite simi- lar to that on Rounded Bridge-spouted Jars of Type 4, 957-8, in Group L, and fragments of very similar bridge-spouted jars from Phaistos (Fiandra 1980, 186- 7 pl. 45. 1, 10, 13). The Cretan contexts are both in the MM II A period. Like Kahun, the Minoan pottery at Haraga could all have been manufactured in Crete during the MM II A period, and found its way to the site in the second half of the Xllth Dynasty. Dorothea Arnold dates the depo- sition of the rubbish deposits, that contained the Minoan sherds, to after the reign of Amenemhat HI and decidedly before the middle of the XHIth Dynasty (1990), so the early XHIth Dynasty is the terminus ad quern. Abydos The importance of the Minoan jar in Abydos tomb 416 was recognised in 1907 by Evans, who used it to form a link between Knossos in the MM II period and Xllth Dynasty Egypt (Kemp and Merrillees 1980, 1 18-19 fig. 38 pl. 13). The form of the jar conforms well with the MM II B Knossian Rounded Bridge-spouted Jar of Type 5. The main decorative motif is similar to that of the Starburst Style, but the central disc is red, as on 956, although the motif on the earlier, MM II A, jar stands alone. A white starburst with red centre on a sherd from Kommos is assigned to MM II B (Betancourt 1990, no. 419). The lozenge motif is similar to that on a cup from a MM II A context at Phaistos (Fiandra 1980, 180-1 pl. 36.5,6). The undulating design on a jar from Monastiraki is also similar and includes lozenges, though in white (Godart and Tzedakis 1992, 68 pl. LXXVI.i). However, the overall decoration is so close to that on K. 1010, a MM II B Straight-sided Cup of Type 9, that it probably comes from the same work- shop. Kemp and Merrillees' exhaustive attempt to fix a date for the contents of Tomb 416 concludes with 'The most positive thing that one can say is that had it been found at el-Haraga, it would fit very well indeed into the Mid- dle Kingdom phase of culture there, always remember- ing that the term 'Middle Kingdom' covers the Thir- teenth Dynasty as well' (1980, 174). The Abydos jar, then, was probably manufactured during the MM II B period in central Crete and could have been brought to Egypt and deposited during the early part of the XHIth Dynasty. Tell el-Dab' a The base and lower body fragments of a rounded cup in the Wavy-line Style of MM II B was found at Tell el- Dab'a in the secure context of stratum D/ 1 , which is stratum G/4 on tell A (Bietak 1995, 19; Walberg 1991, 1 1 5-20; MacGillivray 1995, 81-4). The level covers the earliest years of the XHIth Dynasty, c. 1790- 1760 BC in the High Chronology. The cup is almost certainly a product of the workshop, that created the Rounded Cups of Type 6 in the Wavy-line Style, characteristic of the groups at the end of the Old Palace period in central Crete, which must then be placed during the early part of the XHIth Dynasty. in Minoica in the Levant Hazor The body fragment of an open form, suspected to be Minoan, was found in Stratum 3 in Area C at Hazor in 1956 (Yadin et al. i960, 91 pl. CXV.13). Thesherd looks very much as though it could have come from a rounded open form, most likely a bowl, but little more can be said without a more detailed publication. The context is late MB II and so would belong to the time of the MM imports in Egypt and the Levant. Beirut Rescue excavations in the centre of Beirut at Kharji in 1954 uncovered a large MB and LB cemetery. In Grotta 4, chamber 1 , was found a fine MM cup (Warren and Hankey 1989, 134-5 pi- I2a)- The cup is not one of the types defined by the present study, but may be part of the period of experimentation evident in the wide vari- ety of singular forms, that make up the fine wares from the North- West Pit at Knossos (Group D). A close par- allel for the shape, though without the distinctive closed base, might be 234. The Group D material is essen- tially unstratified, but the majority of the fine wares can be referred to the MM II A and MM II B periods. The form is also quite similar to a cup of central Cre- tan manufacture found on a burnt floor of the MM II B or early MM HI A period in Building 6 at Palaikastro (MacGillivray et al.y 1998). The most likely date for the Beirut cup, then, would be late MM II B or early MM III A. Byblos The excavation in 1922 of a large rock-cut chamber tomb or 'hypogeum' of 'Phoenician' type produced a group of undisturbed artefacts including an obsidian jar from the reign of Amenemhat HI and two silver vases</page><page sequence="105">1 06 HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS said to be of Aegean origin (Virolleaud 1922). One, a spouted jug, is not like those of central Crete (ibid., 285 fig. 5 pl. LXIV.10). The other, a rounded cup with em- bossed interlocking spirals, may be recognized as the inspiration for the painted design on Egg-shell Ware cup 620, but even more so for the Precision Stamped Ware of the MM II B period at Knossos. The ceramic copies of the cup should be later than the Minoan pot- tery at Kahun and Haraga and after the end of Amenemhat Ill's reign. A full analysis of the latest pos- sible date in Egyptian and Aegean terms would be nec- essary before attempting to make the link between the obsidian jar and MM II B at Knossos. Rescue excavations in 1955 revealed a tomb first used in the EBA, then re-used in the MBA (Baramki 1973). Associated with the second interment is a Minoan bridge-spouted jar, similar in form to 1002 and deco- rated in the Wavy-line Style, with a pattern very much like 356. The jar is almost certainly the product of the Knossian workshop producing the Wavy-line Style of the end of the MM II B period. In his excavations in the town of Byblos, Dunand reports the discovery of seven fragments of MM pot- tery from a depth of about 2 metres in 'levée X' (1939, 191 pl. CLXXVII no. 2986; Schaeffer 1948, 66 fig. 74. 2-4). The fragments all belong to a rounded bridge- spouted jar, most similar in profile to Knossos Type 6. The decoration is difficult to decipher, but seems to be related to the Heavy Spiral Style with closed spirals. Form and decoration, then, indicate that the vase was manufactured in the late MM II B or early MM HI A period, most likely at Knossos. The Minoan pottery seems to indicate a link between Knossos and Byblos at the end of the Old Palace pe- riod. Ugarit The rim fragment of a Minoan cup was found in the ossuary tomb XXXVI (Schaeffer 1949, 256 fig. 109A). The fragment belongs to a rounded cup decorated in the Wavy-line Style and is almost certainly a Knossian product of the MM II B period. A second Minoan cup from Ugarit was found in the dromos of Tomb LXXXVI (Schaeffer 1949, 256 fig. 109 pl. XXXVIII bottom). It has some of the features of the Wavy-line Style, including the pattern-painted base decorated in and out, the use of tiny white dots in the patterns and the cup's form, but the main motif, while constructed above and below an undulating line, incorporates an ivy pattern not seen in Crete until the LM I A period (Bernini 1995, 64 fig. 8E). One wonders if the cup could not have been painted over, at a time several generations subsequent to its manufacture. In 1937 Schaeffer cleared a particularly rich group of finds from a built Tomb LVH of Middle Ugarit 2 date (1938, 222-50). While none of the pottery is obvi- ously Minoan, two vases certainly imitate Cretan pro- totypes. One is a rounded bridge-spouted jar of similar size and form to Cretan jars of the same type, but in- stead of the arched handle of Crete, the same position on the shoulder is occupied by double handles of Syro- Palestinian type (ibid., 242 fig. 35I pl. XXIV). The other is a red burnished jug, quite out of place in the local sequence and suspected of being imported, but very similar to 591 in Group E and examples from the con- text of Group N in PLATE 144 (ibid., fig. 35H pl. XXIV). A third vase in the tomb is a 'local' jug of a type very similar to the Dolphin Vase from Tomb 879 at Lisht, now known to have been manufactured in Gaza (ibid., fig. 35D pl. XXIV; McGovern et al. 1994). Qatna Excavations at Mishrifé-Qatna in 1924 produced the rim fragment of a Rounded Cup of Type 6 in the Wavy- line Style (Du Mesnil du Buisson 1926, 324 fig. 41). Unfortunately, the context at 'la falaise' is not recorded, but the MM II B cup's presence at the site of ancient Qatna provides evidence for Cretan ceramic products being traded in the interior of Syria, at the time of their popularity on the coast (Schaeffer 1948, 117). PART 5. SYNTHESIS Cretan relations with Egypt in the Middle Kingdom may be viewed as a society very much under the influ- ence of the dominant power of its time. For this reason, I have decided to link the Minoan periods to specific Egyptian reigns where possible, both because I believe that significant changes in the rule of the most power- ful state in the region must have had some effect on neighbouring states, but also because the shifting sands of Egyptian time seem to play less havoc with the Cre- tan periods, if they are linked to royal accessions. Thus, it can be suggested that the foundation of the palaces at Knossos and Phaistos be linked to the accession of Senusret I in 1953, 20 years into the Xllth Dynasty, allowing for the rule of Amenemhat I to overlap with the latest stages of the MM I A period. The Cretan pottery in Egypt may indicate a shift in regional influence within the Cretan Old Palace period. The Lisht composite vase (Li. 1) and Qubbet el-Hawa jug are stylistically the earliest Cretan imports and both almost certainly products of E Cretan workshops of the MM I B period. The crinkle-rimmed cups from Haraga Tomb 326 would best be seen as imitations of metal or ceramic vases of the MM I B period in E Crete. A rela- tionship between Palaikastro and Zakros and early Xllth Dynasty Egypt may be hypothesized, though little can be offered in terms of reciprocal goods until the Old Palace period levels are more fully explored at the Cre- tan sites. The distinctive styles of late MM I A and MM I B Knossos are found in the Cyclades and Greek main- land, but not in the Levant or Egypt.</page><page sequence="106">HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS 1 07 The ceramic forms inspired by the silver wares in the Tôd treasure are found in MM I B and MM II A deposits at Knossos and Phaistos, and so the MM II A period should have begun by the end of the reign of Amenemhat II in 1876. As it seems that the Cretan pottery styles undergo a relatively minor development between the end of MM I A and the end of the MM I B period, I have chosen to place the events that mark the end of MM I B at the end of the reign of Senusret I in 1908. This would allow forty-five years, or between one and two generations, from the foundation of the major palace structure at Knossos to the time of the first ma- jor archaeological event at the end of MM I B. A significant percentage of the Cretan ceramics found at Kahun and Haraga have been shown to have origi- nated in the Mesara in the MM II A period, perhaps indicating a strong link between Phaistos and Egypt during the middle and later half of the Xllth Dynasty. As this was a period of well documented diplomatic ties between Egypt and her neighbours, it would be in- teresting to speculate on the influential role Phaistos and the Mesara might have played during this long pe- riod of stability in the eastern Mediterranean, especially during the reign of one of Egypt's strongest rulers, Amenemhat III, 1 853-1 808 BC. Knossos at this time seems to have continued to look N, as the Minoan pot- tery in the Cyclades again seems to resemble most closely that of Knossos. The death of Amenemhat III initiated a time of weak rule and may have led a certain amount of instability, that may have encouraged the Hyksos conquest of the Delta, and enlargement of Lisht in the XIHth and XlVth Dynasties (Kuhrt 1995, 176-7). The changes in the Delta must have had serious effects on the coun- try's foreign diplomatic and trading relationships, and could be one of the factors responsible for the decline in the influence of Phaistos by the end of the Old Pal- ace period, in favour of Knossos. The shift to N central Crete is suggested by the Abydos jar and Tell el-Dab'a cup of Knossian MM II B origin, both in late Xllth or early XHIth Dynasty contexts after the reign of Amenemhat III. For this reason I have chosen to place the events that mark the end of the MM II A period, after the end of the reign of Amenemhat III and before the XHIth Dynasty context of the el-Dab'a cup. The most suitable horizon is where Kitchen places the end of the Xllth Dynasty, in 1795; though anywhere within a range often to fifteen years after Amenemhat III could be argued. I propose to place the end of the MM II B period close to the time of the deposition of the el-Dab'a cup, roughly 1760. The relatively short stretch of 35 years would help explain the minor changes in Cretan ceramic technique and design from the end of MM II A to the end of MM II B. The major changes in technique, form and design in Minoan ceramics from the end of MM I B to the end of MM II A could be accounted for by the 1 13 year interval proposed here, thereby allow- ing for perhaps four to five generations of craftsmen and clients. The nature of the events at the end of the MM II A period in Crete could indicate the end of a period of conflict on the island. The most convincing evidence for this is the sudden proliferation of fortifications and administrative posts and the improved military tech- nologies, as suggested by the dagger types being pro- duced in Crete (Wiener 1991; MacGillivray 1993). Cretan exports to Egypt may be seen to fall away during the frequent changes of the rulers in the Xlllth and XlVth Dynasties and subsequent Second Interme- diate Period. It may be that the lack of a strong figure- head in Egypt left the Cretans without a clear trading partner or diplomatic ally in the Nile. At roughly the same time, Knossian products and their copies began to appear on the Levantine coast, perhaps signalling the direction that the new balance of power in the east- ern Mediterranean was taking. Sixteen years after the death of Amenemhat HI, Hammurabi rose to power in Babylon and set about consolidating his realm. Hammurabi's accession in 1792 and his period of ex- tensive conquests crowned with the capture of Mari in 1760, coincides quite closely with the proposed dates for the MM II B period in Crete (Kuhrt 1995, 108-9). This is also the date of the Dolphin vase, a Syro-Pales- tinian product of MB II A-II B date in the early to mid- dle XHIth Dynasty context of tomb 879 at Lisht, but partially decorated with Aegean-like dolphins (McGovern et al. 1994). The Knossian exports to Byblos and Ugarit, the imitation of Minoan forms and the addition of Aegean design motifs to Syro-Palestinian vase forms, may now be placed against the background of the Mari letters. The Cretan products and their local imitations may be linked to the Kaptarite interpreters who lived at Ugarit and were paid in tin (Wiener 1 99 1 ; Neimeier 1991,191). In one letter, Zimri-lim offers to Hammurabi the gift of a weapon (kakkum kaptaru) partly covered with gold and the top inlaid with lapis lazuli (Dossin 1939, 1 1 1- 12; Astour 1973, 19-20; Durand 1983, 258-61). We may now offer as examples the swords from the palace at Malia (Chapouthier and Charbonneaux 1928), and es- pecially one from the Quartier Mu (Detour nay et ai, 147-9, frontispiece, fig. 219). The palatial context has been clarified by Pelon and placed at the end of MM II or beginning of MM III (Pelon 1983, 701-3). The Quartier Mu context is the major destruction at the end of MMII. Both contexts are near or at the end of the Old Palace period at Malia, which Cadogan and Poursat equate roughly with the end of MM II B at Knossos, and thus exactly contemporary with the last years of Zimri-lim, whose career ends in 1760. The Cretan link is further supported by the 'Canaanite' jar fragments, 1021, from Knossos. The associations out- lined above are charted against the background of Egyp- tian chronology in FIG. 3.3.</page><page sequence="107">IO8 HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS The fall of Mari in 1760 saw the closing off of the routes to tin and copper sources for the W, and thus the collapse of what may have been a major part of the eco- nomic basis for the Cretan traders on the Syro-Pales- tinian coast. This could explain why the next area we find Minoan ceramics is at the SE Aegean sites of Trianda in Rhodes, the Seraglio in Kos, Miletos and lasos (Furumark 1950; Davis 1982; Papagianopoulou 1985). The earliest stylistic dates for the pottery is MM II B or, more likely, early MM IH A (Papagianopoulou 1985, 87 fig. 1). The Cretans, perhaps now under the central authority of Knossos, were forced to establish new trading posts near the sources of copper and tin but far from the reaches of the emerging Babylonian dynasty. The MM IH A jug in the Creamy-bordered Style, found in a Period V tomb context at Troy, may reflect the Cretans' explorations of the NE Aegean coast- line at this time (Korfmann in press). The date of the Minoan finds from Samothrace is relevant here, as they also could be part of the pattern of the search for new trade routes in the early neopalatial period (Matsas 1995)- Evidence for exchange between the Aegean and Egypt on a significant scale does not re-appear until Ahmose founds the XVIIIth Dynasty in c. 1540 BC thereby restoring order and stability. The Cretan pal- aces respond by re-opening communications, as re- flected in the discovery of LM I B ceramics at Abydos and Amarna (Warren and Hankey 1989, 14i~4),and the numerous Egyptian alabaster vases that begin to ap- pear in and around Knossos (Warren 1991^). While history may be a continuum it should not be treated as a linear development. Relations between towns, states, or regions at any given time must be ex- amined within the context ofthat time, and not as logi- cal steps towards the conclusions historians long to make. The influences apparent in the Old Palace pe- riod at Knossos may have been due to exchanges with a variety of regions, that altered over time. The many changes apparent between the Old and New Palace period in Crete, then, may have been due less to the earthquake in central Crete around 1760 BC, than to a move away from the dominant political and social power of Egypt following the weakening of the central authority's control over the ports at the end of the Xllth Dynasty. The time of the XIH/XIVth Dy- nasty finds the Cretans exploring the Levantine coast, and setting up new trading relationships with the emerging powers in North Syria and Babylon. These come to an abrupt end with the violent campaigns of Hammurabi and the new frontiers being established in North Syria, very close to the end of the Old Palace period in Crete. The combined effects of the Cretan earthquake and the renewed search for raw materials that brought the Cretans into contact with the SW Anatolian cities at the time of Anitta, King of Kussara, in what may have been the formative years of the Hittite Old Kingdom (Kuhrt 1995, 225-8), must have had a profound influence on how the Minoans viewed their world. These factors could account for significant changes in art and architecture, as well as religion and philosophy; but this is more than sherds can tell.</page><page sequence="108">HISTORICAL IMPLICA TIONS 1 09 Year Dyn.
