<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROCK ART IN ARID LANDSCAPES: Pilbara and Western Desert petroglyphs Jo McDonald and Peter Veth Abstract This paper develops a testable model for understanding rock art within archaeological phases of the arid northwest Pilbara and Western Desert bioregions. It also presents the first multivariate analysis of foundational recording work undertaken almost 50 years ago, and deploys more recently recorded assemblages from the Burrup Peninsula (Murujuga) and the Western Desert. It establishes a framework for testable hypotheses about how art production in these adjacent bioregions through deep-time reflects information systems, emergent territoriality, group identity and signalling behaviour against a backdrop of climatic oscillations, including the LGM (23-18 ka), Antarctic Cold Reversal (14.5-12.5 ka) and intensification of ENSO (3.8-2 ka). The Pilbara piedmont has clearly defined gorges with major water sources; the Western Desert has uncoordinated drainage punctuated by well-watered but subdued ranges. We argue that rock art has been used to negotiate social identity in both contexts since each was first colonised. The role that art may have played in the formation of social networks in these different landscapes through time is the key focus of this paper. We hypothesise that the episodic use of art as signalling behaviour in the Australian arid zone can be linked to behavioural correlates and major archaeological phases with discrete signatures that can be tested from myriad sites. Introduction The Pilbara-Western Desert nexus involves contrasting landscapes which, in the recent past, had disparate language groups and different territorial arrangements. There is a dynamic contrast in the social relations within and between these two fundamentally arid environments. The rock art in these landscapes provides us with insights into the nature of these social dynamics through time. We describe an engraved (petroglyph) art province from the Western Desert and compare this with a number of Pilbara petroglyph style provinces (following Wright 1968) (Figure 1).

Two Distinct Arid Landscapes The Pilbara is a mountain and piedmont desert with well defined river systems draining into the Indian Ocean. It contains numerous gorges, many of which retain abundant and year-round supplies of water, which form habitable corridors throughout a desert uplands landscape. These habitable corridors have provided a territorial basis for the social organisation of their inhabitants. It is likely the deep pools in these gorges and wetlands, such as the Fortescue Marsh, have provided a focus for people since the initial settlement of the Pilbara. The Western Desert lies inland and east of the Pilbara Uplands. This vast lowland comprises a series of sandy and stony deserts, with internal and uncoordinated drainage. Amongst the extensive dunefields are numerous subdued ranges—many of which contain permanent water. As described by Tindale (1974), desert people classify the different types of waters found across these regions, graphic representations of which often appear in rock art and contemporary acrylic paintings (Figure 2): • Soak waters—trapped in deep sands; • Claypan waters—where shallow supplies form after rain; • Rock holes (both permanent and semi-permanent); • Permanent waters {jila)—often springs—sometimes located in these isolated ranges; and, • Creek and river pools. Knowledge about waterholes is curated as social geography through Dreamtime narratives and this knowledge has allowed for seasonal and ritual use, the planning of journeys, and, in times of drought, retreat. Veth (1993, 2005; Veth et al. in press; and see Smith 2013 for a recent recasting of this same model) has identified that throughout the Western Desert the more permanent and reliable water sources, and their associated biota, would have functioned as refugia, and has modeled human settlement behaviour during fluctuating climatic conditions. We have previously suggested how Western Desert rock art can be modeled as part of this settlement behaviour (McDonald and Veth 2006,2010). In this paper we build on recent developments in understanding Pilbara settlement patterns to present a model with art correlates for occupation across these two adjacent but different arid landscapes. We provide an initial analysis of several Pilbara style provinces, following Wright (1968), and examine how Mulvaney's (2010) chronology developed for the Dampier Archipelago fits into this broader model of the arid Pilbara piedmont. Ethnography and Linguistics Ethnographic and linguistic information help illustrate how people were arranged across these landscapes, and the nature of their social interaction in the recent past. In the Pilbara, 21 socio-linguistic groups were recorded at contact (Tindale 1974). The area of particular interest to our analysis has been defined linguistically as the Ngayarda subgroup of the Pama Nyungan family (McConvell 1996, pers. comm. 2007; O'Grady 1966; O'Grady and Laughren 1997). At least 15 of Tindale's 21 socio-linguistic groups fall into this classification, and notably these are surrounded on all sides by distinctly different language subgroups. Linguistic stratigraphy suggests that the distinctive Ngayarda subgroup is at least 4000 years old (McConvell 1996). The Pilbara language groups had well-defined territories, with boundaries being the relatively waterless watersheds of river catchments (Peterson 1976; see Figure 1). Territorial ranges varied in size from 500 square kilometres for the Yaburara on the coast (Dampier Archipelago [Muruguja]), up to 42,400 square kilometres for the Nyamal, whose territory included the Coongan and Shaw Rivers, and the headwaters of the Yule and Turner Rivers. Tindale (1974) noted significant movement between groups just prior to contact and suggested that Western Desert lores and customs were highly influential in the period just before European contact. Social influences at this time were moving from east to west—from the arid lowlands to the arid piedmont. In this paper we focus on a small portion of the Western Desert: 200,000 square kilometres at the western interface between the Pilbara and the Little Sandy Desert. Tindale recorded six dialects of the Wati language here, covering territorial ranges of between 16,000 square kilometres for the Wirdinja (Warwula; Horton 1994) and 78,000 square kilometres for Kartujarra/Putijarra (Martu; Horton 1994). Territorial ranges were large and included a series of ranges, waterholes and other water sources of varying permanency. Territorial boundaries were based on dialect rather than language boundaries, and these were not necessarily Figure 2 Map of the Natatjara group's storage wells, pools and sand soaks, also showing tracks made between the various water sources.

Given that population sizes for the defined groups in both the Pilbara and Western Desert were ca 300 people, population densities were all extremely low, but varied markedly across these two landscapes: on the Pilbara coast, in Ngarluma territory, population density was 1 person/29 square kilometres; in Panjima territory, in the Pilbara piedmont, the population density was 1 person/57 square kilometres; and in the Western Desert, in Putijarra territory, the population density was 1 person/173 square kilometres. In summary, the Pilbara represents a dissected arid landscape centred on well-watered gorges, with relatively smaller territories, distinctive languages and comparatively higher population sizes. Western Desert territoriality is more loosely arranged across a wider area, with reliable but more amorphous water sources often shared by neighbouring groups speaking different dialects of the same language. Information Exchange in the Desert Information exchange theory (IET) has been mobilised into rock art analyses through the notion of style as social strategy. Following Wobst (1977), this has been used to correlate stylistic information with the nature of prehistoric social networks and broad environmental parameters. Where social networks are closed and kinship, language and territoriality are relatively rigid, stylistic information will demonstrate distinctive group identifying behaviour (and rock art styles will be perceived as being stylistically heterogeneous); where social networks are open (with language, kinship and territoriality being shared), rock art will be stylistically homogeneous and function to provide broad scale intergroup cohesion. We have written previously on this fertile/arid dichotomy, arguing that aggregation behaviour can explain the high levels of stylistic heterogeneity which are sometimes encountered in the desert (McDonald and Veth 2006, 2010, 2012). What we are interested in here is the fact that arid zone rock art appears to demonstrate changing levels of stylistic heterogeneity across the Pilbara-Western Desert interface, and that these levels of heterogeneity change through time. We suggest this can best be explained by contextualising rock art production into a broader suite of behavioural correlates which can be understood against the canvas of changing environmental conditions through time. Rock Art and Mythology Across the Pilbara it is believed that petroglyphs were not created by people but by Marga (Ancestral Beings) who lived in the Dreamtime (Juluwarlu Aboriginal Corporation 2008; Palmer 1975:155). Petroglyphs are seen as mnemonic devices to recall songs and invocations learned during initiation or for use in hunting (Palmer 1975:157). Mythological narratives link features in the landscape and rock art provinces, e.g. Ganya (near Gregorys Gorge), Depuch Island and the Port Hedland petroglyph sites. These are linked by Ancestral Beings, including Kangaroo (marlu), Two Men (Wati Kutjarra) and Seven Sisters (Minyiburu) (Palmer 1977). Where mythology has been ascribed to particular glyphs, as part of the regional narrative of Ancestral Beings, the sites are usually incorporated into larger geographic features (e.g. Depuch Island). Specific motifs on Depuch Island were identified as representing these beings: ... the petroglyphs were thought not only to have been made by the Dreaming ancestors, the marlu or the Minjiburu, but also were regarded as symbols of the deeper meaning and reality of their mythology. And so they are seen as representations of the myth and ritual adornments through which the body of traditional belief is expressed (Palmer 1977:45). The Western Desert petroglyphs are similarly perceived. The Martu distinguish between pictographs—created by humans and depicting both every day and sacred themes—and petroglyphs, which were created in the Dreamtime and left behind by creator-beings (McDonald and Veth 2008, in press; see Gould 1969; Tonkinson 1974). The creator-beings are said to have had great magical power, which included the ability to assume animal forms at will. Pilbara Petroglyphs The Pilbara region possesses a 'dazzling array of Complex Figurative styles' (Maynard 1979:107 following Dix 1977; Petri and Schultz 1951; Worms 1954; Wright 1964, 1968, 1977). Various distinct style regions have been described, including Port Hedland (Franklin 2004; McCarthy 1962), the Upper Yule River (Woodstock-Abydos, Figure 3), Cooya Pooya (including the Fortescue River, Figure 4), and the eastern Hamersley Gorges and Ophthalmia Ranges (Figure 5). The art of Depuch Island (Berndt 1964; Crawford 1964; McCarthy 1961), extending up the Sherlock River, is another style province—as is the spectacular Dampier Archipelago (Murujuga) (Figure 6; and see Bednarik 2002a; Green 1982; JMCHM 2005, 2006, 2009; Lorblanchet 1992; McDonald and Veth 2009; Mulvaney 2009, 2010, 2013; Turner 1981; Vinnicombe 1987,2002). It has been noted that the art provinces in the Pilbara piedmont are 'separate styles (which) seem to be quite distinctive and there does not seem to be any evidence of the gradual evolution of these figures' (Wright 1977:115-116). The examples given here show the stylistic heterogeneity demonstrated by anthropomorphic depictions in a few of these style provinces. We have no absolute or relative dates for the regional engraving provinces of the Pilbara, except for suggestions through the micro-erosion technique (Bednarik 2002b:Figure 9) and, more recently, through erosion rates calculated from cosmogenic nuclide measurements (Pillans and Fifield 2013:105), that the slow weathering rates mean that they could be between 27,000 65,000 years old. While some have argued that the development of regional styles may be a Holocene and perhaps even more recent phenomenon (Ross 2013, following Rosenfeld 1993), others suggest that regionalism can be demonstrated much earlier in the occupation of Australia (e.g. Balme et al. 2009; McDonald and Veth 2010; Mulvaney 2013). Indeed, Maynard's (1979) tri-partite sequence recognised (following the earlier work of many, e.g. Edwards 1968) that the pan-continental Panaramitee1 likely started in the Pleistocene. The complex Pilbara engraving styles were interpreted by Maynard (1979:100) as more recent manifestations than the Panaramitee and Simple Figurative styles. The problem with Maynard's model was that this generally saw art evolving from simple to more complex: an assumption which has been found to While recognising the problems and connotations which derive from this name, we still consider that this is a pan-continental style which represents the earliest art form in most regions (cf. Mulvaney 2013). We are referring to the (primarily) geometric and track assemblages that have the archaic face as a late phase addition focused across the arid zone (Edwards 1968; McDonald 2005; Mulvaney 2010) 68 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 77, December 2013</page><page sequence="4">Jo McDonald and Peter Veth Figure 3 Upper Yule petroglyphs (from Wright 1968:Figures 16-20).

For this paper we utilise the art of a single Western Desert art province: that of the Calvert Ranges (Kaalpi), where 32 individual petroglyph sites in two major valley systems have been recorded in detail. The petroglyphs represent only 20% of the rock art in this province: most of the art is produced with pigment. The petroglyphs here are incredibly diverse in terms of style and subject matter, with the following general categories recorded: • Cupules; • Intaglio bird and kangaroo tracks, with circles and small pecked dots (interpreted as animal scats; Clegg 1987) art: classic Panaramitee style; • Archaic Faces, as recorded elsewhere in the arid zone (McDonald 2005); some complex bodies and headdresses which are unique to the Western Desert are found here (Figure 7); • Large decorative infilled anthropomorphic figures; • Pecked anthropomorphic figures, small to medium scale with sinuous arms and dot infill (Figure 8); • Small infilled terrestrial animals; • Abraded outline, lightly pecked infill figurative motifs mostly life size animals and birds (Figure 9); and, • Battered figurative motifs. It is assumed that stylistic variability in the petroglyphs can be explained by their having been produced over a long period of time; the different characteristics described here are given in best-guess chronological order, based on rare superimpositions, patination and weathering states. Some engraved art has stylistically contemporaneous pigment analogues, but most of the engraved Western Desert art predates the pigment art styles from this region. None of the engraved art is yet dated, but our model for settlement patterns provides a temporal scale which we hope to test by various dating methods in future research. An Arid Zone Settlement Pattern with Rock Art Correlates Occupation of the Australian arid zone commenced more than 45,000 years ago (Veth et al. 2009) by, we assume, small highly mobile groups of people (Williams et al. 2013). By the Holocene, occupation patterns demonstrate phases of dynamic social and economic transformation. We have previously modeled how rock art may fit into a more general occupation model for the arid zone using IET (McDonald and Veth 2006,2007). This modeling has been based on environmental data, regional occupation indices as derived from excavations (O'Connor et al. 1998; Smith 2006; Veth 1993,2008; Veth et al. 2000,2011; Williams et al. 2013) and direct radiocarbon (AMS) dating of the most recent phases of pigment art in a number of Western Desert style provinces (McDonald et al. in press). From the plethora of recent mitigation excavations, the earliest Pilbara published dates lie at ca 41,000 cal. BP and there is increasing evidence for occupation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Law et al. 2010; Morse 2009; Ryan and Morse 2009; Sinclair and Wright 2012; Slack et al. 2009).

Conclusions Comparing social networks and art production across the Pilbara with those found across the Western Desert has great research potential. More detailed analyses (both recording and dating) will allow us to test our models of changing art production through time in both of these regions. By identifying varying social and physiographic landscapes within the arid zone we have further explored a contradiction previously identified with information exchange theory: i.e. the precept that arid environments and open social networks will produce stylistic homogeneity, while fertile environments generate stylistic heterogeneity (e.g. Gamble 1982; Smith 1989). Extreme stylistic heterogeneity across the arid Pilbara cannot easily be related to social organisation based on contact language boundaries. By exploring how physiographic parameters in the arid zone influenced social landscapes we are developing a more nuanced view of both style as social strategy, and perceptions of how rock art was used in the complex network of personal and social identifying behaviours through time in these landscapes.
