<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAKISTAN - 3 Excavations of a Bronze-Age Ceramic Manufacturing Areas at Lai Shah, Mehrgarh At the invitation of the director of the Mission Archeologique de lTndus, Dr J.F. Jarrige, I went in February 1985 to take part in the excavation of a ceramic manu? facturing site dating back to the third quarter of the third millennium B.C. and lying about one kilometre west of the Mehrgarh site (fig. 1). Evidence of craft work, which can be seen over a large part of the southern slope of the Lai Shah hill, had already been spotted during the previous excavation campaign carried out by the French Archaeological Mission. In the spring of 1984 R. Wright dug a trial trench on the southern slope of the hill where unauthorized excavators had caused some damage; the dig brought to light two double-chamber up-draught kilns, one of which in an excellent state of preservation, separated from each other by a later burial. The February 1985 excavation was designed to cover more extensive exploration of the area and verification of a number of queries that had arisen from the particular type of archaeological deposit. Excavation over an area of 120 square metres revealed three main settlement periods in a deposit little more than a metre deep at its thickest. The main evidence for these three periods consisted in the very different functions for which the area was used at different times. The first period identified, dating back roughly to the first half of the third mil? lennium ( = Mehrgarh VIIa-b; Jarrige and Le chevallier 1979) is documented by only slight traces on the gravel and sand of the sterile substratum upon which the archaeological deposit rests. The only primary evidence belonging to this period comes from a small trench dug on the southeast side of the site (fig. 2, sq. GH 6). It consists of a double row of large pebbles joined by a surface bearing clear signs of regular activity and some small pits containing ashes. No evi? dence was found of pottery-making activities in the area for this period. The most substantial evidence may be referred to the second period when, with the previous structures of the first period partially removed, the area was reorganized Fig 1 - Location of the Lai Shah hill at Mehrgarh. (Jarrige and Lechevallier 1979). 458</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2 - Layout of the area examined at the end of the excavation period (March 1985). The kilns, from left to right, are: nos. 1 and 3, superimposed, belonging to two different structural phases; no. 4, north of the previous two, the smallest among those found; no. 2, found by R.

On the basis of pottery comparisons, the use of the area for such a manufacture can be dated to the third quarter of the third millennium, corresponding to Mehrgarh period VIIc (Jarrige and Lechevallier 1979; Jarrige n.d.). Finally, the third period, which is separated from the previous periods by a gap of several centuries, includes the last function for which the area was used, i.e. a burial place. The pits of the many identified burials penetrate the underlying levels of the first and second periods down to the grave itself where the bodies were laid in the sterile ground and covered with large mud bricks. By concentrating mainly on the evidence of craft activity, and thanks also to the particular conditions of the archaeological deposit, it was possible to obtain much of the information that the excavation was intended to yield while removing a minimum of the deposits belonging to the third mil? lennium. In fact, most of the data were collected just by emptying the pits of the later tombs as far as but no further than the covering of the bodies, as well as through pickling up to the top of the deposit that had not been disturbed by traces of surface erosion. By cleaning the surfaces and ex? cavating with horizontal cuts into the pits of the later tombs it was possible to compile extensive stratigraphic interpretation while reducing to a minimum disturbance of the remaining evidence of activities involving the kilns. In limited sectors of the 3rd millennium deposit, however, excavation also involved the removal of stratigraphically significant units. Our work resulted in the finding of more kilns (as well as more extensive examination of the two found by R. Wright in 1984) and afforded further proof of an area special? ized in pottery firing. The six kilns brought to light were of the double-chamber type (up-draught kiln) with the two chambers arranged one above the other {combustion chamber and firing chamber) separated by floor (grate) in which a series of holes (flues) had been cut for the circulation of hot air. The combustion chamber was formed by a hollow cut into the side of the hill while the firing chamber, of which only one kiln retains the base (kiln 1) (fig. 3), originally stood out above ground level. The state of preservation varies from the first kiln found, with its grate still in position, to mere traces of the base of the combustion chamber of kiln 6 (fig. 2, sq. D 8). All the kilns show signs of having been regularly restored inside (restoration of the chaff tempered clay lining on the walls of the combustion chamber and of the calcareous coating of the grate) and outside (lime-like paving of the area around the kilns). Waste products from firing (mainly shards of cracked or over-fired pottery, setters and supports for earthenware jar manufacture) were found in varying degrees of concen? tration across the whole excavated area. The highest concentration of kiln wasters was to the north, where access to the firing chamber probably used to be, while waste from clearing out the combustion chamber was mainly to the south, below the stoke hole of the combustion chamber itself. More waste material was found in the combustion chamber of the first kiln discovered (Jarrige, personal communication), and in a ditch about one metre deep found in the south? east corner of the excavation area. The pottery, for which the considerable amount of waste found afforded ample docu? mentation, places this complex in a period falling within the third quarter of the third millennium. A dating of no earlier than 2500 is suggested, above all, by the links with the last Mehrgarh phase (= VIIc, Jarrige and Lechevallier 1979), and with the end of the pre-Harappan levels at Kot Diji (for dating, see Mughal 1983: 14). Diagnostic elements for attribution include the dishes with pat? terns of parallel lines round the rims (fig. 4a-d) and in one case with the type of pattern (fig. 4a) found at Mundigak (period IV 3) (Casal 1961: pi. XXXIVb), the carinated cups (fig. 4d-e) whose shape recalls that of the bowls found at Kot Diji 460</page><page sequence="4">..? ... , ? . . *r&gt;.?V.-. Fig. 3 - Kiln no. 1. This is the first and best preserved of kilns to have been found. Like all the kilns in the excavated area, it showed signs of damage caused by burials on all exposed sides. The pit for one of these burials, lying to the south, cuts the fire tunnel in two. (Khan 1965, fig. 17 no. 1, fig. 18 nos. 1-6, fig. 22 no. 3, fig. 24 nos. 3-5, fig. 26 1-6) and in period lib at Amri (Casal 1964, fig. 69 no. 273), the jars of the late Quetta wet type (fig. 4f) comparable with the ones found on sites in the Quetta valley (Fair servis 1956: 269, fig. 59) and, finally, the jars with semi-lunate rims and Black-on Red Slip type patterns (fig. 4g-h), also found in the Quetta valley in the Damb Sadat III period (Fairservis 1956: 315 no. 518, 326) and at the end of the pre Harappan levels at Kot Diji (Khan 1965: fig. 13 no. 5, fig. 14 no. 6, fig. 15 no. 6, pi. XVIII nos. 2-4, 6). Documentation of the artefacts found also refers to fragments of female terracotta figurines of the Zhob type (fig. 5) (Jarrige and Lechevallier 1979, figs. 38-39), the figurine of a bull in unbaked clay (fig. 6), many setters (fig. 7), some incised conical stands used for jar forming (fig. 8) (cf. Tepe Rud-i Biyaban, Vidale 1983: figs. 7-8) and two smoothers fashioned from sherds (fig. 9) (for Balakot cf. Dales 1974: fig. 14; for Tepe Raikes and Tepe Rud-i Biyaban in Sistan, Vidale 1983: figs. 1-6). The existence of a sub-urban factory at Lai Shah seems to be linked with a steady process of urbanization, the most striking signs of which can be observed in many centres of the Indo-Iranian area around the middle of the third millennium (Tosi 1984: 27). As well as a tendency for firing installations to be located in outlying areas because of the pollution caused by a manu? facturing process wherein pyrotechnology and large-scale production play decisive roles (Bi scione and Tosi 1979), there was also a tend? ency to concentrate installations in limited areas to maximize productivity when required by socio-economic conditions (Feinmann 461</page><page sequence="5">A E T F ^ B ^ 7 H I Fig. 4 - Pottery forms most often found in the second period, a-d, h-i: Brown-on-Buff Ware; e-g: Buff Ware; j: Quetta Wet Ware; k-1: Black-on-Red Slip Ware.</page><page sequence="6">^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^H ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1 Fig. 5 - Anthropomorphic figurines of the Zhob type.

Fig. 8 - Engraved conical base used while jars were being fashioned.</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 9 - A smoother made from a recycled sherd. 1982: 181-82). The endemic tendency to decentralization and concentration of several installations within a restricted area reached a logical conclusion in the creation of extra urban factories, probably working at a sub regional level and extremely specialized in the type of raw material to be transformed. Analysis of the traces of minerals on sherds of Buff Ware from Shahr-i Sokhta and Tepe Rud-i Biyaban 2 shows considerable differ? ences in the types of clay used in the two centres during phase 3 (c. 2400-2300 B.C.), suggesting that supplies arrived from two separate areas despite the vicinity of the two sites, which lie at a distance of only 30 km. from each other (Reindell and Riederer 1983: 229). Whatever links there may be between types of craft work and the societies that produce them (Rice 1981), there still remains the problem of the links between the com? plexes where the crafts were performed, the type and quantity of material remains orig? inally produced and the remains that are to be observed (for a theoretical formulation of the problem cf. Schiffer 1976). Little research has been carried out so far on this problem in protohistorical craft activity areas. In the past the existence of pottery kilns in excavated areas has generally been dealt with rather summarily, rarely receiving more than a bare mention. In other cases the kind of criterion adopted for considering installations involved in craft work has been the number of kilns and their location. For areas containing remains from pottery work, the various types of organization can be summed up according to TosFs classification of craft areas (1984: 24): sub-urban factory with a great many kilns, like Tepe Rud-i Biyaban 2 (Tosi 1970), Tepe Dash and Tepe Raikes (Mariani 1984: 122; Biscione and Tosi 1979: 41); craft quarter in the urban area, as at Hissar and Altyn Depe (Biscione and Tosi 1979: 37-45); single production unit ? the most commonly found type. The use of this classification affords an initial parameter to identify one of the variables in the urbanization process that took place during the third millennium. Closer analysis of these areas, which formed part of a programme that was carried out by an IsMEO research group and focused on the study of areas where crafts were performed (for bibliography cf. Vidale n.d.), showed on the one hand the scope for further classification of the types of activi? ties, and on the other the error risk inherent in interpretation of evidence based on the empirical criterion of quantitative assessment. As was observed during research at Moenjodaro (Pracchia n.d.), the cumulative effects of prolonged activity in a single installation and the subsequent effects of erosion can, at first glance, give a very similar picture to that of an extensive craft area where various kilns were in operation at the same time. When error occurs in such cases it is the result of an overall assessment of the evidence without suf? ficient space-time distinction of the various components of the archaeological deposit. Our activities at Lai Shah therefore focused on achieving the most precise space-time interpretation possible, aiming both at quan 465</page><page sequence="9">titative assessment of remains from craft work and at determining the modifications under? gone by the various features in the course of time. However, the quantitative parameters, which are reliable in proportion to the degree of accuracy employed in ascertaining depositional and post-depositional patterns, present a further obstacle to research in that there is no absolute reference point for the potential quantity of waste product that a craft area can produce. Even if an extremely accurate space-time interpretation of the units could be achieved, the problem would never? theless remain of how to deduce from the quantities observed for each unit an esti? mation of, for example, the intensity of production and relations with the community it is destined for. Given the impossibility of observing the total waste product originally deriving from one or more production cycles, quantitative parameter research must necessarily apply to something rather more complex than the mere assumption of a direct proportionality between the volume of waste observed and the volume of the original productive output. Research in terms of relative quantitative parameters was therefore one of the ap? proaches borne in mind during the initial stage of work at Lai Shah. Relative quan? titative parameters have so far been indi? viduated: number of firing installations in operation at the same time, degree of con? centration of kilns per area unit, number of type products and extent of standardization of the artifacts. Research work started out from the study of this type of evidence, which was considered to be a significant source of information on the features of production in relation to the socio-economic context determining them. The application of relative quantitative parameters and the control of the spatial aspect of the 'syncronic slices of a dynamic system' (as defined by Schiffer 1976: 43) offer the basis for dis? tinguishing the characteristic and the modi? fication of the evidences in the course of time. This excavation at Lai Shah provided an opportunity to explore the problems involving the relation between production and the material remains left over, as well as extensive exploration of the area itself. The singularly specialized use of the area provides the ideal conditions for reducing the possible appear? ance of variables due to interaction among various activities to a minimum. The aim of our excavation was, in short, to analyse an isolated ware production context while allowing as far as possible for misleading factors. The most significant of these are the cumulative and reductive effects of natural and anthropic depositional and post-depo sitional events not directly linked with the manufacturing processes. The fact that the archaeological deposit showed a cyclic series of calcareous lime-like pavings that had been laid as periodic restorations gave us the opportunity to draw up a very accurate space-time grid. According to this grid the seven kilns that were found in a deposit varying in thickness from about one metre to just a few centimetres were installed in two successive structural phases, each of which was in turn divided chrono? logically by a series of successive restorations. Moreover, the hypothesis that these resto? rations were seasonal (cf. Audouze and Jarrige 1979: 220 for ethnographical evidence relat? ing to the same geographical area) could provide the basis for an extremely accurate relative chronology for the excavated area (*). i1) For each of the kilns 1 and 2, which were operating simultaneously in the first structural phase, 7-8 restorations were noted; moreover, there were visible signs of at least two restorations on each of the four kilns of the second phase. If each structural resto? ration corresponds to a yearly cycle of activity, the period during which the area under examination was in use could be between 9 and 14 years, with or without a break between the first and second phase. Uncer? tainty about the simultaneous use of some second-phase kilns is due to the almost total lack of stratigraphic accordance, since the structures are very close to the surface. 466</page><page sequence="10">This hypothesis may in the future be put to the test through careful interpretation of the sedimentological features of the deposit. Moreover, correlation of the complex network of stratigraphic accordance has led to the detection of the simultaneous use of at least two kilns for each of the two structural phases identified. On the basis of the quantitative parameter we thus have the opportunity to identify a more structured organizational range of work. The diversifi? cation of the type of kiln noted for the second structural phase (the two simul? taneously operating kilns, nos. 4 and 5, are of considerably different dimensions) could point to a steady increase in craft special? ization. The winter 1985 excavation was carried out on a limited scale and was of an essentially preliminary nature and, apart from the descriptive data collected, many of the findings and interpretations offered here must therefore be considered by and large hypo? thetical for the time being. However, they represent a basis of hypotheses and related lines of research for more extensive explo? ration of the area in the future. Stefano Pracchia REFERENCES Audouze, F. and J.F.
