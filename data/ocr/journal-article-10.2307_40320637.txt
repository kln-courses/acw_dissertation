<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frank X. Ryan The "Extreme Heresy" of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I: A Star Crossed Collaboration? Introduction: Lost Mariners' Chronicles. Hilary Putnam closes his 1994 Dewey Lectures with the warning that the tendency to overspe- cialize in philosophy - to place its various problems in tidy insular com- partments - "is a sure way to lose all sense of how the problems are connected," and thus to lose the thread of philosophy itself.1 And surely John Dewey himself is without peer in his legendary ability to both "see together" what others "see apart" and to channel the philo- sophic impulse toward the construction of successful "life-careers." This knack for building connections has undoubtedly helped re- new interest in Dewey's philosophy in the past decade, a revival now extended to virtually every aspect of his thought. Like banks of lights sputtering to life in a venerable old ball park, recent books and essays have recovered five decades of work, from the foundations of instru- mentalism to the seminal yet neglected Logic: The Theory of Inquiry of 1938; we consequently have fresh new insights into Dewey's meta- physics, theory of knowledge, esthetics, ethics, critique of technol- ogy, and his social, political, and religious thought.2 One area, however, has remained conspicuously dark. Toward the end of his life Dewey was befriended by Arthur F. Bentley, a frustrated academician turned journalist and orchard owner. In a voluminous correspondence spanning nearly two decades, Dewey and Bentley painstakingly hammered out a philosophy of "transaction," a successor to pragmatism Dewey carne to regard as the capstone of his celebrated career. Little, however, has been written about the Dewey- Bentley collaboration, the essays it produced published as Knowing Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Summer, 1997, Vol. XXXIII, No. 3</page><page sequence="2">775 Frank X. Ryan and the Known, or the philosophy of transaction. And what has ap- peared has been largely negative, with Bentley bearing the brunt of the criticism. Thelma Z. Lavine, for instance, suggests that Dewey was naively unaware of "major differences" between himself and Bentley due to which Knowing and the Known not only failed to attain its goals but actually mirrored the logical positivism it purport- edly opposed.3 Herbert Schneider alludes to an even more sinister plot in which "Bentley teased, lured, drove his friend into revising the basic terminology of his thought."4 Paul F. Kress finds Bentley foisting upon Dewey a bizarre process cosmology that dissolves all distinctions of particularity and individuality in a "cosmic flux." For Kress, Knowing and the Known thus chronicles the misadventures of "a lost mariner, a man who has thrown the compass of reason over the side as so much excess ballast."5 While both serious and severe, these charges may be met on two fronts: 1) This essay chronicles Dewey's profound influence on the development of Bentley's thought, an influence subsequently "bor- rowed back" in a collaboration in which Dewey was an active and informed participant. 2) Its sequel supports the conclusion that not just in intent, but in content as well, the philosophy of transaction is a worthy capstone to Dewey's celebrated career. The Obstinate Outlander. Eleven years Dewey's junior, Arthur F. Bentley grew up in the Midwest and received an A. B. in economics from the John Hopkins University in 1892.6 Attracted to European economics and social thought, he pursued graduate work in Ger- many the following year. Here, in what Sidney Ratner describes as an experience "crucially important to his intellectual and emotional de- velopment," (DB: 25) Bentley absorbed the teachings of Adolf Wagner, Gustav Schmoller, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey. Simi- lar to Dewey's "genetic" method, Wagner and Schmoller advocated a historical and inductive approach to economics that opposed the rigid hypothetical-deductive method of English and Austrian thought. Simmel and Dilthey were even more influential, for they inspired a lifelong quest for what would ultimately evolve into a "transactional" world-view. Simmel argued that individuality and personality were</page><page sequence="3">The "Extreme Heresy3" of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I 776 the products of complex group involvements within a social matrix. Dilthey opposed positivistic attempts to reduce the human sciences to the natural sciences. Bentley 's doctoral dissertation, completed at Hopkins in 1895, argues for a Dilthey-inspired behaviorism that re- jects rigid mechanical or causal frameworks. Bentley accepted a one-year position in sociology at the Univer- sity of Chicago, in the Golden Age of Dewey's "Chicago School." James Ward astutely observes that Chicago should have been Bentley's "natural home," for "few of Dewey's colleagues and disciples had a first-hand knowledge of currents in European social theory equal to Bentley's."7 Unfortunately, it seems he was both isolated from his colleagues and frustrated as a teacher.' His contract was not renewed, and with no other academic offers he accepted a job as a newspaper reporter and was soon promoted to editor. Though successful, this pressure-cooker career led to bouts of physical and mental exhaus- tion. In 1911 Bentley retired to the tranquility of Paoli, Indiana, where he operated an apple orchard for the remainder of his years. The one positive outcome of Bentley's ordeal at the University of Chicago was his introduction to John Dewey. Though he did not come to know Dewey personally, he audited lectures on ethics and logic. Bentley regarded this experience as a turning point of his intel- lectual life; nearly four decades later its recollection would motivate his first letter to Dewey: While you were at Chicago, I had a place at the outer edge of one of your courses, where I secured a certain manner of vision which, so far as I can appraise such things, I have long regarded as one of the three or four most valuable aids I have received. (DB: 51) Bentley had been astounded by the fact that Dewey, alone among his American professors, viewed the relation between "self and "world" in terms strikingly similar to the teachings of Simmel. For both philosophers,</page><page sequence="4">777 Frank X. Ryan the "individual" formulation can be developed out of the "social" formulation much more vividly and completely than the purportedly "social" can be developed out of the "indi- vidual." (DB: 27) Bentley was equally impressed by Dewey's attack on dualisms, especially the pernicious failure to see "that subject and object are constructions of the primitive acts of knowledge." (DB: 27-28) This, in turn, fed a hunger for the fundamental pragmatic connection be- tween knowledge and action and the "double-barrelledness" of knowings and knowns (DB: 28; 65).8 In retrospect, Ratner surmises, the headlong plunge into the gritty world of Chicago journalism "was the best thing that could have happened to a young intellectual like Bentley;" (DB: 28) for here abstract theory and the street-level cauldron of vices and virtues, rags and riches, bums and bosses, congealed in a critical mass. The result was The Process of Government, a "classic in political science" that presaged current studies in the dynamics of interest groups and pres- sure politics.9 An early draft honored Simmel and Dewey, along with Walt Whitman and Polish sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz, as "the real writers of this book" (DB: 85). 10 The Process of Government in fact is an ingenious blending of the conflict politics of Simmel's Sociologie and the consensus building of Dewey's The Public and Its Problems. Here Bentley anticipates and warns against what he and Dewey later call "self-actional" thinking, the tendency to character- ize society in terms of causal "powers - " be these ideals, sentiments, or a "general will." Instead, sound scientific methodology must be- gin with an entire social situation - the dynamics of power bases in action and "the streams and kinds of activity that gather among the people and rush into these spheres" (DB: 30). Upon trading Chicago for the tranquility of the Indiana coun- tryside, however, Bentley's writings become more reflective and theo- retical as well. His Linguistic Analysis of Mathematics (1932) em- ploys Dewey's dismissal of subject/object dualism to rehabilitate the foundations of mathematics. Here Bentley rejects both the subjec-</page><page sequence="5">The "Extreme Heresy" of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I 778 tivism of Brower's intuitionism, where naturai numbers and elemen- tary operations are mental "givens," and the realism that demands a correspondence between mathematical symbols and "external real- ity." Instead, he develops Hilbert's claim that the value of math- ematical operations lies wholly in their consistency, a notion Bentley wants to push beyond symbolic notation to the terms, phrases, and conceptions we use to talk about mathematics. Yet Bentley departs from Hilbert's camp, and places himself firmly in Dewey's, in insist- ing that the criteria of consistency are operational or "postulational" rather than formal: they mark "the most general form of linguistic control which we may establish" in a given area of inquiry."12 Such postulations are not cca priori," "necessary," "indubitable," or even "true;" instead, they are observable and revisable generalizations that have proven themselves trustworthy when called upon in inquiry, and as such may be counted as reliable guides to future inquiries. Bentley was also fascinated by contemporary physics, where he saw parallels important to his own evolving social philosophy. Quan- tum mechanics, for example, replaces the "billiard ball" interaction of discrete particles with an integral "field" whereby the "reality" observed depends upon the instruments employed and the interests of the observer. Similarly, Einstein's space-time supplants the Newtonian bifurcation of space and time: no longer the static "box" in which events occur, space-time is a dynamic thread in the fabric of reality. To Bentley, this suggests that the outmoded distinction be- tween man and society should be replaced with "man-society," a theme introduced in Relativity of Man and Society (1926) and fully devel- oped in Behavior, Knowledge, and Fact (1935). The key concept of this latter work is what Bentley calls social "Fact." This postulate is "behavioral" in the sense that its meaning and reference is established on the basis of direct observation, and not by mental operations or by any supposed correspondence to "ex- ternal reality." It further replaces the mechanical causation of Watsonian behaviorism with a behavioral space-time where meaning and reference are established within the context of a social situation. Most significant, as we shall see, is Bentley's insistence that the "be-</page><page sequence="6">779 Frank X. Ryan havioral" is to be regarded as functional, rather than either "physi- cal" or "vital:" Fact, he asserts, must not be confused with the speci- fication oí content that lies within the province of physics or biology; instead, it delimits a general mode of social activity, a "background of expression," that underlies these more specialized inquiries.13 Bentley deploys the formidable neologism "tellurian-sidereal cos- mos" to characterize the Weltanschauung conveyed by Fact. This, however, conveys nothing more ominous than the "double- barrelledness" of experience. Simply put, "tellurian-sideral" means "earth -perspective - " not in a subjective or anthropomorphic sense, but in Dewey's objective sense that a "world" is the functional prod- uct of a matrix of behavioral -linguistic involvements, including scien- tific inquiries into Fact increasingly beyond the range of direct hu- man involvements.14 "Knowings" express the inferential "inward- ness" of Fact; "Knowns" the "outwardness" of achieved content. Both, however, are reciprocal phases of behavior, not ontological primitives that separate "mind" from "matter."15 The Linguistic Analysis of Mathematics zná Behavior, Knowledge, Fact, became catalysts of the Dewey-Bentley correspondence. A copy of the earlier book, included by Bentley with his introductory letter of 1932, remained unread until Ernest Nagel drew Dewey's atten- tion to it nearly three years later. Dewey wrote a belated reply prais- ing the volume as having given "me more enlightenment and intel- lectual help than any book I have read for a very long time"(DB: 51). He subsequently incorporated into his own Logic Bentley's ideas about the interrelatedness of logic and inquiry in contrast to positivism's arid formalism, acknowledging his debt to Bentley in the preface (LW12: 4). Dewey also examined both the galleys and the published edition of Behavior Knowledge and Fact, praising it as "a landmark in more than psychology," for I get suggestions from most of the books I read, but it has been a long time since I got as many ideas as I have from yours. (DB: 54)</page><page sequence="7">The "Extreme Heresy" of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I 780 Although their early correspondence focused on the subject-ob- ject relation and the constructed self, the beckoning horizon of "trans- action" inexorably drew them beyond the "pragmatism" with which Dewey's name was virtually synonymous. In June of 1943, Dewey suggested a joint collaboration to "fix a set of leading words," (DB: 137) and the following seven years witnessed an explosive chemistry Bentley once likened to a "fever ward" (DB: 513). In this period more than one hundred drafts passed between them, from which ensued fifteen published essays collected as Knowing and the Known.16 In his lifetime Bentley produced nine books and some three dozen articles. This output, while modest when compared to Dewey's, is substantial enough to make us wonder why he was so widely over- looked in his lifetime, and would surely be but a footnote today if not for his high-profile collaborator. Three likely reasons may be offered. The first is simply that Bentley was significantly ahead of his time: just as a generation accustomed to weighing national "moods" and "sentiments" was not prepared for his astute prediction of interest groups and power politics, so too were his warnings of psychologism in formal logic and dualism in epistemology unheeded by a generation engrossed with the language and methodology of positivism. In the mid 1940s, Bentley and Dewey stood virtually alone at the end of a road later travelled by Wittgenstein, Schutz, Kuhn, Dummett, and Putnam. The second reason is that Bentley, with two brief exceptions, was an outlander throughout his career, deprived of the professional and institutional ties essential to success in academe. Before he actually met Bentley, Dewey suspected that his associate "might be soured by lack of academic recognition," only to be surprised by "one of the most genial men Tve ever known" (LWÌ6: 489). Dewey's surprise at Bentley's geniality was surely genuine, for the third and perhaps most telling reason for his lack of success was a writing style that could be acrimonious to the point of savagery. By his own admission, "nobody loves me," (DB 388) for I am ruthless, irresponsible, willing to seem absurd, when</page><page sequence="8">781 Frank X. Ryan necessary: I probably would not spare my best friend if his slaugh- ter seemed important for what I was trying to do. (DB: 58) It is indeed unfortunate that a magnificent vision and dazzling techni- cal skills should be occluded by a style that badgered, berated, and bullied. Bentley himself regrets "arousing antagonism" to the point of having "repelled most of the people I ought to have addressed" (DB: 588, 91). His own autobiography and epitaph, he wryly surmises, could well be summed up as "Here Lies Obstinacy" (DB: 605). Despite the havoc Bentley's pugnacious style brought upon his own career, it actually seems to have helped the collaboration. Under its influence, Dewey curbs his tendency to write "atmospherically" and "pull his punches;" (DB: 91; 137) instead, he addresses his crit- ics by name, gets down to specifics, and generally puts key to strikepad with an uncharacteristic boldness. On the other hand, we witness a kinder, gentler Bentley; though still aggressive, he is more fair and balanced - willing to admit strengths in opponents' views and build consensus rather than enmity. In toto, their divergent styles complement and reinforce each another. Like the gentleman farmer who loves the feel of topsoil yet pauses to appreciate the broad panorama of sun and sky, field and forest, Dewey nurtures his transactional seedlings with an almost spiri- tual reverence to the broad currents of Western history, culture, and thought. Bentley, in contrast, is the hired hand who energetically plants, fertilizes, weeds, and prunes, throwing himself into the "close hard work" of dissecting formal systems and developing postulational alternatives.17 As we shall see, this fusion of talents produced a har- vest of extraordinary abundance. But before siphoning the silo we must confront the long-standing rumor that the farmer was indolent as the hired hand poisoned the grain. Life in the Fever Ward. Despite a vaunted firmness of conviction, Dewey took his experimental spirit so much to heart that he was inclined to "suffer fools gladly."18 Indeed, his life-career crossed paths with a schemer, a dreamer, a healer, an irascible eccentric, and even a femme fatale}9 Here our tabloid curiosity must be limited to the</page><page sequence="9">The "Extreme Heresy" of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I 782 claim that the orchard owner from Paoli was but the last molding in this ungainly gaggle. Bentley himself envisions his relation with Dewey as something akin to a system of binary stars. By his own admission, his star was professionally erratic, all over the map. The stress is not on whether / could influence you, but on the fact that in any such contact any participant is apt to move erratically - tem- porary perturbations of orbit, we might say - due to propin- quity of another celestial body. (DB:27S) As we have seen, however, others have measured far more than "temporary perturbations" in this "propinquity." Instead, Bentley 's erratic track is held liable for knocking Dewey's naturalism completely out of orbit, or at least immersing it in a murky holism. In either case, the stars of Dewey and Bentley would not merely cross, but collide in a cosmic catastrophe! As we have seen, even Lavine's intro- duction to the reissue of Knowing and the Known, a golden oppor- tunity to resurrect a lost masterpiece, instead disparages it as a failure. The content of the work itself, of course, will help us decide whether or not this is so; but first we must address the specific charges against Bentley. Lavine's attack is especially trenchant, for she fo- cuses on three counts: 1) instead of a bona fide collaboration, "the entire conceptual apparatus" oí Knowing and the Known "has come from Bentley 's Behavior, Knowledge, and Fact* (LW 16: xxxv). 2) These views not only differ significantly from Dewey 's own, but are 3) wrong-headed to the point of undermining Dewey's instru- mentalism and naturalism: Specifically, Bentley a) embraces a math- ematical formalism that completely breaks with common sense and experience; (LW16: xix) b) extends this to the view that logic, too, is "a formal system meeting criteria of consistency and coherence, nei- ther foundational to inquiry nor 'developed' out of ongoing inquiry;" (LW 16: xxxi) and c) ultimately inflates this logicism into a bizarre "process cosmology" that ultimately dissolves all distinctions between selves and objects, individual "life careers" and natural environments.</page><page sequence="10">783 Frank X. Ryan (LW16: xii; xvii; xix; xx) Let's take each objection in turn. Count 1: Knowing and the Known 'Primarily Advances Bentley Js "Conceptual Apparatus." This claim is simply false. Dewey and Bentley discussed at length both their objectives and the extent of their indi- vidual and joint contributions. In the typescript "Importance, Signifi- cance, and Meaning," Dewey directly confutes the rumor that Know- ing and the Known is mostly Bentley's work; quite to the contrary, it is equally the capstone of his own lifetime of thought and reflection: It is pertinent to note that the positions set forth in the re- cent volume [Knowing and the Known] had been in process of independent maturing for some forty years; the book thus represents a view which, whatever else be said about it, is not casual or improvised but is the outcome of studies carried on over a long period and taking critical account, between them of a large number of traditional and contemporary move- ments. (LW 16: 318) Interestingly, those who actually knew both Dewey and Bentley and had witnessed the dynamics of their relationship, such as Sidney and Joseph Ratner and Jules Altman, corroborate Dewey's assess- ment. As Sidney Ratner sees it, The Dewey-Bentley correspondence shows that K&amp;K is an authentic joint production - a demonstration of the impor- tance of the actual intellectual transactionsDewey and Bentley participated in - each contributing ideas, criticizing and re- formulating the other's position on different issues and ar- riving through a reasoned consensus on a final formulation that satisfied both authors. This is as much a Dewey book as the Dewey-Tufts Ethics! (LW16:489) As Ratner points out, the mere fact of some two thousand ex- changes amply demonstrates the authenticity of the collaboration. Yet the content of the Correspondence further documents this by re-</page><page sequence="11">The "Extreme Heresy" of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I 784 vealing the dynamics of their working relationship. In some instances, as in the entire essay on "Specification" and the middle sections of "A Terminology for Knowings and Knowns," (DB: 514; 362) Dewey composed an original draft subsequently edited by Bentley. Indeed, Dewey 's exhaustive discussion of "terminology" (LW 16: 53- 70; see also DB: 173ff; 179-180) clearly refutes Lavine's charge that the "en- tire conceptual apparatus" is Bentley 's. To be sure, Bentley wrote many of the rough drafts, but in doing so he incorporated input from Dewey he had carefully indexed (DB 499).20 Dewey would subse- quently reply with suggestions and emendations and, as we have seen, in some cases literally dozens of drafts were exchanged until both men were satisfied. For Ratner, this means that even if Bentley did much of the actual writing, "we cannot say that Bentley imposes his views on Dewey, since the ideas presented are all to be found in Dewey 's work."21 Another proof of the authenticity of the collaboration is the scru- pulous treatment of material that was not jointly produced. Bentley agonized over whether Dewey should sign the first paper, "On a Certain Vagueness in Logic," which he estimated at "90 per cent" his own work. He realized that Dewey's "name on it is worth fifty times what mine is," yet did not want to implicate his gentle friend in its "raw" manner of exposition. Dewey sharply replied that he didn't "think much" of either potential justification - the only relevant point being "it assumes work on my part I haven't done" (DB 294-295). Ultimately, Dewey did not sign this paper, and later took the same position on "Logicians' Underlying Postulates," an essay he described as "99.44 pure Bentley, with a few slips and tucks by Dewey" (DB: 443). On the other hand, Dewey did sign the crucial paper on "Trans- action and Interaction." In this case Bentley, who wrote the initial draft, admitted that "about half of the contents is your own sug- gested phrasing or developed in correspondence and approved by you. I could not use it as my own under any circumstances" (DB: 278). This overarching concern for integrity is found in each of the seven other papers they chose to sign jointly. Count 2: Knowing and the Known does not Reflect Dewey's Ac-</page><page sequence="12">785 Frank X. Ryan tual Views. Given that such exchanges uphold Knowing and the Known as a genuine collaboration, one must wonder how Dewey could have been tricked or cajoled into signing his name to views he did not fully endorse. There is no evidence of intellectual frailty of decline - in- deed, in this period Dewey alone produced four major works and some hundred and fifty shorter pieces. He attributed his continued agility to such involvements, writing to Bentley in his ninetieth year that I've often wondered whether the cerebral backwardness that often seems to exist with ageing isn't a product of an un- natural loss of intellectual interest during the earlier parts of life. You and I seem to indicate it isn't inevitable. (DB: 608) Nor does flattery seem to be at issue. The record shows that Dewey and Bentley did not merely rubber-stamp each other's pro- posals or always see eye to eye. They argued, for example, about whether to retain the word "behavior," which Dewey feared might be linked to Watson's causal behaviorism (DB: 220). Bentley, more- over, was initially lured by the bluntness of Moore's "common sense" realism Dewey had long disparaged as the dry rot of "ubiquitous" sense-certainty (DB: 442-448). 22 Conversely, Bentley could not fathom Dewey's "genuine admiration" of Whitehead, whom he saw as offer- ing only a "mentalistic" cosmology (DB: 101). Although these differences attest to the overall health of their working relationship, we must agree with Lavine that in two signifi- cant areas Bentley did in fact press his own views to the detriment of the project: a) One trait Bentley shares with his positivist adversaries is an aversion to metaphysics. Knowing and the Known reflects this by renouncing all "ontological primitives," and further jettisons words such as "reality" and "experience" as unworthy of "bother." After decades of trench warfare with the likes of Bakewell, Santayana, McGilvary, Rogers, Russell, Cohen, and Lovejoy, however, Dewey realizes that this only invites the metaphysician's rejoinder - "Oh lets bother!"- together with the dismissal of instrumentalism as mere</page><page sequence="13">The "Extreme Heresy" of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I 786 "psychology" or "philosophical anthropology." As such, Dewey's in- tent is not to destroy metaphysics but to reconstruct m such a way that the words metaphysics and metaphysical would make sense on experiential grounds, instead of on the ground of ulti- mate Being behind experience serving as its under-pinning. ("Experience and Existence," LW 16: 389) b) Though there is little to the claim that Bentley ignores the importance of inquiry, his mistrust of metaphysics does lead him to overlook the significance of Dewey's famous postulate of immediate empiricism: "what is is what it is experienced as" in primary or nonreflective experience.23 In the Correspondence, Dewey makes sev- eral attempts to expand Fact to include "havings" as well as "knowings." He reminds Bentley that behind any case of knowing is "a case of what is there" (DB: 215). And "what is there" zxt qualita- tive immediacies - "havings on the first and 'lowest,' least-developed stage of name-knowings" (DB: 424). In Experience and Nature, Dewey tells us that nonreflective experience has temporal quality but net temporal order: it has a "feel" and a "rightness," as a comedian's "timing" conveys the meaning of a joke, but no direct consciousness of increments of time that is characteristic of reflective temporal or- der (LW 1: 9 Iff). Space, similarly, has a "rightness of fit" - a chair discovered overturned disrupts settled experience - but no cognitive grasp of spatial extension. As ontologically primitive, qualitative im- mediacy guards "against the view that there is a reality behind what is immediately present. . ." (DB: 144).24 Unfortunately, little of this finds its way into the text. Dewey's pithy postulate gets a cameo bow, but even this is linked to knowing: "what one can investigate a thing as, that is what it is, in knowledge and in Fact" (LW 16: 126). And as we shall see, the "cosmos of Fact" regrettably does not go beyond the reflective "temporally durational" and "spatially extensional" to embrace the qualitative immediacy of having (LW 16: 26). Though noisome, these omissions are easily rectified with no harm</page><page sequence="14">787 Frank X. Ryan to the overall project. For a) Bentley's rejection of "metaphysics" is clearly only a rejection of traditional or non-Deweyan metaphysics. That Knowing and the Known has fully "metaphysical" aspirations is evident in the proclamation that the cosmos of Fact embraces "all that is, or can be inquired into" (DB: 216). b) It is equally easy to expand the cosmos of Fact to include havings-had as well as knowings- known. This is a shift of emphasis instead of an alteration of content, since havings-had are settled knowings -known - reflective consum- mations of inquiry that return to and enrich primary experience. Besides, to admit that Knowing and the Known has its omissions and flaws in no way justifies the conclusion that Bentley flattered Dewey into submission. Indeed, their exchanges could verge upon curtness when deadlines neared; and on one occasion, when Dewey proposed striking a passage his junior partner regarded as "the very heart of our project," Bentley replied "you evidently feel that a lot of my positions are divergent from yours," concluding sulkily: I want you to feel perfectly free - indeed I would urge you - to postpone [this project] or toss it aside altogether. It won't make the slightest difference to me. I am used to it. . . (DB 260-261) To my knowledge this is the only real crisis in their professional relationship, and the way Dewey defused it is especially instructive. He acknowledged "an undoubted difference of background and ap- . proach:" where Bentley pursued of knowledge "as a solid, extensive, sociological fact," his own focus had been upon showing how in- quiry extends this knowledge (DB 263-264). Yet Dewey regarded thiscontrast as complementary and beneficial: I repeat, I don't feel a lot of your positions are divergent from mine. I think our different modes of approach comple- ment each other. I hadn't expected at my age (I'm 85 in October) to get a "refresher course" that really refreshed. I feel I've got it through this contact with you, and that I can</page><page sequence="15">The "Extreme Heresy9 of John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley I 788 restate my own mode of approach and its results with my feet more on the ground than in the past. (DB: 264) Dewey repeated this sentiment on many occasions. Bentley's criti- cisms have helped him correct some "besetting sins," and "I owe too much to them" to regard them "in the least officious" (DB: 98). "I don't know whether there is a difference between us, save that you are more scrupulous in use of words than I am - to my own loss" (DB: 107). "What you write stimulates me to go over my previous position and try to bring it up nearer to date. . .(DB 207). "My approach will continue to be distorted and taken for what it isn't meant to be till something definitive along your line is available" (DB: 244). Quite late in life, Dewey put his entire relationship with Bentley into perspective for Grace De Laguna: "Largely due to him, I've finally got the nerve inside of me to do what I should have done years ago" (LW 16: 489). Although these citations reveal Dewey's debt to Bentley as he expanded and revised his earlier positions, there is no hint that he may have been coerced or deceived into endorsing views contrary to his deepest convictions. Count 3: Bentley's Views Undermine Dewey's Instrumentalism and Naturalism. Despite the lack of either apparent motive or means, we must still admit that if Dewey was indeed deceived into betraying his most cherished beliefs, his protests to the contrary would mean noth- ing. The full continuity of Dewey's "classic" naturalism with transactionism must await the sequel. Here, however, we may supple- ment the earlier biographical sketch by addressing Lavine's specific criticisms. a) Regarding Bentley's alleged mathematical formalism, it is true that the Linguistic Analysis of Mathematics urns for a completeness in mathematical discourse now generally regarded as futile. At the same time, we should recall that his guiding criterion of consistency is pos- tulational rather than formal, and thus thoroughly empirical and fallibilistic. We previously noted that the postulational approach is based upon the claim that the adequacy of any mathematical system</page><page sequence="16">789 Frank X. Ryan is to be judged by its inquiry-derived consequences, an approach cham- pioned in Dewey's Logic?* In many cases such consequences need adhere only to the rules and parameters of the system itself, thus Bentley and Dewey agree that the power and elegance of mathemat- ics may be enhanced by detachment from any purported "correspon- dence" to "external reality."26 This helps explains the attraction of Hubert, who is lauded not for an arid formalism but for a vision that steers between an outmoded rationalistic intuitionism and the view that mathematics must replicate external reality. Recast in terms of problem-solving behavior, what we have got. . . is an advance whereby the rigid play- game, frozen Hubert is brought to life as a going process. [Positivists such as Walter] Dubislav can say that mathemati- cal terms are not names [for external reals]. . . but we can go further and add: "and yet they are alive." We transfer the Hubert process from a third-realm mechanism to a live natural process. (DB:S72) b) The close connection between inquiry and mathematics is, if anything, redoubled for logic. Contrary to Lavine's claim that he sees logic in terms of pure formal relations "neither foundational to inquiry nor 'developed' out of ongoing inquiry," Bentley himself in- sists that he is in complete accord with Dewey's claim that "inquiry is process, process is across time. A logic of inquiry as opposed to one of proof is 100% ongoing"(JD£; 60; 403). In a memo entitled "Dewey's Development," Bentley praises the Logic for identifying "reflective thought with objective inquiry." For Dewey alone makes this identification in a continuum of inquiry, as sug- gested by Peirce, i.e. as a cultured behavior in the lap of biology. He obtains thus the basis for a fully empirical ac- count of logical process. (DB: 494) Bentley 's commitment to a logic of inquiry and sound scientific</page><page sequence="17">The "Extreme Heresy" of John Dewey and Arthur F.

According to Dewey, Bentley's approach was distinctly from the side of science especially as contemporary developments in physical and bio- logical science bear upon the problem of bringing into exist- ence a competent scientific and effective method of inquiry into human relationships as they now exist. (LW 16: 319)27 And Ratner writes that though Bentley recognized the validity of logical operations, [he] insisted that logic had to be seen as an integral part of scientific in- quiry and had to have its assumptions and primary terms clearly related to their empirical sources. (DB: 34) c) Although more will be said about "cosmos" in Part II, we already have ample evidence that Bentley endorses neither a standard "process cosmology" nor a holistic dissolution of all distinctions be- tween self and object, individual life-career and environing society. As we have seen, "tellurian-sidereal cosmos" is merely an inflated name for the double-barrelled "breadth" of inference and "depth" of acquired content that is tht encountered world in Experience and Nature. A cosmos of "Fact" reifies this "breadth" and "depth": as knowing, Fact "cover[s] the entire range from indeterminate situa- tion to warranted assertion - in other words, the entire range of in- quiry. . "(DB: 191). As known, Fact denotes the outcomes of success- ful inquiry - the common-sense and scientific objects and processes we come to know as constitutive of the natural universe. Bentley is thus echoing the genius of the new "Copernican Revolution" from Dewey 's The Quest for Certainty: i) Objects are uniformly objectives of inquiry; once settled, they constitute tools and data for subse- quent problem-solving activities - what is not yet known or beyond the scope of present human affairs denotes potential products of fu- ture inquiry, not things-in-themselves lurking behind a veil of sense</page><page sequence="18">791 Frank X. Ryan data.27 ii) From this it emphatically follows that the rejection of "self as a psychical or physiological entity dwelling exclusively "within the skin" does not "dissolve" all distinctions between self and natural environment. Instead, it means that a self is constructed in ongoing engagements with the world: a "life-career" of continuous threads woven within ongoing "modal patterns of acting" (DB: 75). From this we at least have an inkling as to why Bentley was such a "refresher course" on ideas Dewey himself had been fleshing out for more than a half-century. In addition to the conceptual advance of "transaction," Bentley also routinely brought to his mentor's at- tention benchmark essays such as "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psy- chology," "Does Reality Possess Practical Character," and "A Natu- ralistic Theory of Sense Perception" - some of which Dewey, notori- ous for seldom rereading his own work, had all but forgotten. To- gether they would polish away the "hidebound terminology" to un- cover the luster of transaction hidden beneath, an ever more resinous glow burnished by the new ideas they were developing. If the foregoing establishes Knowing and the Known as a genuine collaboration congruent with at least some of Dewey's long-held views, then we have defeated the case for its preemptive dismissal. Of course, this alone does not refute the charge that Dewey and Bentley fail to achieve their stated goals - to do so we must examine the arguments themselves. Admittedly, no mere essay can hope to do justice to a work in many ways as daunting as the Logic it seeks to extend and advance. Nevertheless, Part II will serve its purpose if it renews discus- sion about this long-neglected final chapter of Dewey's thought. NOTES 1 .

In a famous passage at the outset of Experience and Nature,</page><page sequence="20">793 Frank X. Ryan Dewey characterizes this double-barrelledness as an integral unity of the how and the what of experience - the "stretch" of inference and the "depth" of content disclosed by inference. "Thought" and "thing," on the other hand, are "single-barrelled," for they are "products discriminated by reflection out of primary experience" (LWl: 13- 19). 9. See Lavine (LW 16: xv, and fn.19) for a discussion of the re- newed interest in The Process of Government. 10.

Although several commentators have discussed the conversion of these essays into book form that began in May, 1947, to my knowledge no one has noted Bentley's letter of 5/23/44 (DB: 25 1 ) confirming that he and Dewey were eyeing an eventual book even before the first essay was written. Knowing and the Known thus has a sense of coherence and direction not found in the usual "collection of published essays." 1 7. Representative of this approach is "A Confused Semiotic," (LW 16: 211-241) where Bentley scrutinizes each of 33 terms advanced by Charles Morris. Dewey admits to being "struck practically dumb by your persistence thoroughness" (DB 45 1 ). 18. John Herman Randall, Jr., in Dialogue on John Dewey, Ed.

Bentley apparently collected so much material that at one point he felt "overwhelmed" by it, writing to Dewey that "the 'office manager' has gone dead" (DB: 522). 21. Lavine, (LW16: xxvii) citing observations made by Ratner in conversation. 22. Interestingly, Bentley reverses his view in response to Dewey's argument, admitting he had been "blind" to what Moore had been doing. Unfortunately, some phrasings that suggest "direct observation" find their way into the text. 23. See John Dewey, "The Postulate of Immediate Empiricism," (1905) MW3: 158-170. 24. Also see DB: 137-138 and "Nature in Experience," LWU: 153. 25. For example, Dewey (LW 12: 403ff.) conspicuously discusses the "postulational" approach to mathematical subjectmatter. 26. For Dewey's characterization of mathematics as "free from the necessity of existential reference," see LW 12: 39. See also his late letter to Albert Balz, (LW 16: 321) where he repeats and expands this definition. 27. This passage also counters Lavine's claim that "Bentley viewed science as descriptive only, and not instrumental to the ends of culture;" (LW 16: xix) and that "the moral dimension of Deweyan pragmatism and the melioristic concern for the 'life career' of the individual human being and the society find no reflection in Bentley's Cosmos" (xx).</page></plain_text>
