<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANATOLIA'S EARLIEST ART By EMMANUEL ANATI Since 1938 when the Swiss anthropologist, Pro- fessor E. Pittard, reported the discovery near Adi- yaman of the first cave art known in Turkey, archae- ologists have located prehistoric rock pictures, cave drawing and mobiliáry art (art on small portable ob- jects) in various districts throughout Anatolia. Some of these finds, like those at Palanli, have not yet been described; other discoveries have received only pre- liminary notices and up to now, no summary exists which treats as a whole the earliest phases of Ana- tolian art, dating as far back as Palaeolithic and Epi- Palaeolithic (the final stages of the Old Stone Age). Scientific excavations in Anatolia and recent studies in Near Eastern rock art together with hints of connec- tions with European prehistoric art, enable us to locate the Anatolian discoveries in a general context and to draw inferences about possible relations and cultural parallels with other regions. The role played even in these remote times by Anatolia as a land bridge between the culture areas of Europe and Asia can be observed. Thanks to archaeological stratifica- tion, to the superposition of different styles of rock art on the same surface and to stylistic and typolog- ical studies, a general chronology can be worked out. My purpose is to present a preliminary panoramic view of Anatolia's Earliest Art, to propose a chronological sequence for it, to stress how much this early art adds to our knowledge of the prehistory of Anatolia and its neighbors and to raise the challenge for further research in a field well worth archaeol- ogists' enthusiasm. The caves of Karain and Öküzini are north of Antalya near the road to Burdur, on the lower slopes of the Sam Mountains just above a wide alluvial plain some 600 m. above sea level. Excavations there, di- rected by Professor K. Kokten of Ankara University have revealed, since their beginning in 1947, Palaeo- lithic and later levels. Both sites produced Palaeo- lithic mobiliáry art and at Öküzini, Professor Kokten has recognized a bovine and an anthropomorphic fig- ure in a series of engravings on one of the walls of the cave. Other engravings seem to be present and an accurate examination of the cave's walls should prove rewarding. Both caves have groups of cup-marks near their entrances and as we shall see also in the Palanli cave, prehistoric art is associated with cup-marks and the connections seem to be intentional. The presence 22</page><page sequence="2">Map of Anatolia showing the five principal regions in which prehistoric art has been found: the caves of Karain and Okiizini in the Sam Mountains; four sites around the village of Beldibi southwest of Antalya; Palanli near Adiyaman; the Hakkari Mountains; Kürtün Ini in the Taurus Mountains in southern Anatolia. The stony hill of Karain. The entrance to the cave with its sloping terrace is visible in the upper center. 23</page><page sequence="3">The cup-marks at Karain just below the terrace, on the path leading to the cave are well carved and often quite deep (up to 35 cm.). At Oküzini by the path just before the terrace of the cave is this altar-like natural rock with a large deep cup-mark in the middle surrounded by smaller ones. On one side of the rock a series of oblique marks has been engraved. ANATOLIA continued of mobiliáry art, of wall engravings inside the caves and of rocks with cup-marks near the cave entrances may indicate that Karain and Öküzini were not just simple habitation sites and that they may have been connected with the local cult of later Upper Palaeo- lithic times (between 15,000 and 10,000 B.c.?). At both sites, Professor Kokten has found that objects come from archaeological levels characterized by a rich flint industry he calls "Aurignacian" (a type named from the Aurignac cave in the Pyrénées). The material assemblage resembles a developed phase of the Ahmarian culture of Palestine and may belong quite late in the Upper Palaeolithic chronological se- quence of the area. So far the main finds of mobiliáry art from this district total seven : three from Karain and four from Öküzini. Of the three objects found at Karain, the fragment of a bone tool carved into a schematic human head shows an interesting similarity to the head dec- orating a Natufian bone object from Nahal Oren at Mount Carmel. Both objects have a prominent nose, a groove across the forehead with oblique eyes below it, a well marked lower jaw with what is probably a pointed beard. If the stratigraphie location given by Professor Kokten is correct - and there is no reason to doubt it - the Karain head is earlier than the Mount Carmel carving and should prove to be an important clue in tracing the origins of Natufian art. The frag- ment of a stone tablet from Karain is engraved on both sides. One side is badly damaged, but it is possi- ble to recognize an animal figure, a part of a second zoomorphic outline, series of parallel lines and a tri- angular, probably vulval, symbol. On the other side the engraved figures belong to at least three phases of carving. The most interesting - because it is unique of its kind - figure on this tablet is the rather realistic human profile with a bearded chin and prominent nose. There are, as well, a zoomorphic figure and several groups of parallel lines. The finger-like series of lines has invited varying interpretations, but no satisfactory reconstruction of the entire figure to which they belong has been made. The composition of the series of parallel lines on this side is like engravings on objects from Öküzini and seems to be a design characteristic of southwestern Anatolian mobiliáry art. In some cases, Professor Kokten believes, such series may represent human figures. On a pebble, the third object from Karain, it is difficult to recognize the an- thropomorphic figure with a spear in hand that Pro- fessor Kokten identifies in his publication of this. 24</page><page sequence="4">Prehistoric mobiliáry art from Karain: from the late Upper Palaeolithic period comes the only bone object found at Karain and Oküzini.

In style and technique, this pebble is, of the group of four, the most similar to more archaic phases of Palaeolithic European mobil- iáry art although it seems to have been found in the same level and context as the other engraved pebbles. The largest decorated object of the group is a stone tablet of peculiar natural shape, decorated on both sides by very fine carvings. The one side has a series of parallel lines filled inside by perpendicular marks crossing from one longer line to the other. The entire surface looks like a single abstract composition and is very decorative. The other side has a peculiar com- position based on circles and what appears to be two 25</page><page sequence="5">Prehistoric mobiliáry art from Okiizini (Upper Palaeolithic period) : Animal outline repeated several times as if the artist tried to find the desired shape.

In the handle-like part of this surface the two parallel lines with the series of perpendicular smaller lines between give the effect of the design of the other side of the tablet. A strikingly similar object has been found re- cently in a cave near Bari, Italy in the context of Epi- Palaeolithic flint industry though dated otherwise by the excavator. Similar patterns are known from Ro- manellian schematic art. The other two decorated pebbles from Öküzini are fragmentary: One is carved with a group of parallel lines and the other (not il- lustrated here) shows carved lines forming a criss- cross pattern. The objects of the Karain and Öküzini complex considered as a whole are all of stone except the bone carving, also the single example of plastic art. The others have carvings on flat surfaces and show no at- tempt at modeling. All are small objects which can be handled between two fingers. Their subject matter includes wild animals and human figures as well as symbols and abstract compositions. If we look for parallels with the art of other regions, the bone ob- ject, as mentioned above, suggests a Natufian head from Mount Carmel while the other finds have af- finities with objects more to the west, for the most part Italian assemblages of final Palaeolithic art like those from Grimaldi, Arene Candide, Grotta Roman- elli and Murgie Baresi. Near the village of Beldibi, prehistoric depictions from the sites of Kum Bucagi, Yatak Yeri, Hayatli Lake and Saricinar Spring are known largely through the research of Dr. E. Y. Bostanci, a Turkish prehis- torian with particular interest in art. At Kum Bucagi, engravings and paintings were found, at Yatak Yeri only engravings and at the sites near Hayatli Lake and Saricinar Spring, only paintings. Further exploration in the area will no doubt uncover more prehistoric art. Meanwhile, the most complete series in the region is the art in the rock shelter of Kum Bucagi, first no- ticed in 1956 by a joint Turkish-European- American expedition. The site was not excavated and studied until 1959 when Dr. Bostanci undertook work there. The cave of Kum Bucagi (some fifty kilometers south- west of Antalya) faces the Mediterranean at about one hundred meters from the modern shoreline and some twenty-five meters above the present sea level. It is a rock shelter in one corner of which a small cave penetrates a few meters into the rock. Some ten meters 27</page><page sequence="7">ANATOLIA continued above the present level of the shelter another small cave, four meters long by five meters wide, appears in the rock wall and when visited showed signs of habi- tation by early man. Excavations were undertaken in front of the rock shelter and a wealth of artifacts was uncovered. The pictures are in the wall of the rock shelter which faces the sea. Breccia concretions still visible in several places of the decorated surface prove that part of the surface was once below the earth and that the terrace at some time was much higher than it is today. Since the first surveyors found the surface at the present level and since no figure can be connected with the spots of concretion, there is no way to estab- lish whether the erosion of the higher deposits took place before or after the execution of the pictures - a fact which is an obstacle to establishing chronological sequences. Three main series of figures can be recognized on the surface of the wall : Series I, the oldest, is engrav- ings; Series II and III are paintings. The engravings of Series I consist of lines intentionally incised (pre- sumably by a flint tool) to complete natural grooves. The only clear figure represents a horned animal with head turned back and upraised front legs, apparently running. It somewhat resembles well known figures in Western European Late Upper Palaeolithic cave paintings, engravings and mobiliáry art. Especially instructive are comparisons with engravings upon bone and antlers from La Madelaine, Laugerie Basse (Dordogne) and Lorthet (Hautes Pyrénées), belong- ing to a final phase of Upper Magdalenian ; and cave carvings in the island of Levanzo off the shores of Sicily which belong to a very belated Palaeolithic tra- dition and date probably to the transition between the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Another paral- lel, this time Anatolian, can be found in the cave en- gravings at Öküzini where the general character of the thin, interrupted and uncertain lines which partly reuse the natural cracks of the rocks is quite similar. They may indeed belong to the same general chrono- logical and stylistic framework although the animal figure from Öküzini is better proportioned and more accurately executed. The fifteen figures of Series II and III can be fitted typologically into five basic forms : Series II Type I - Four simple cruciform figures. Type II - Four anthropomorphic crosses, or cru- ciform figures, with a bifurcation at the bottom (legs perhaps ?) and a dot. A circle or semi-circle on top is the head. 28 Type III - Three phi-shaped figures, or figures evolved from the basic form of a cross with the upper part enclosed in a semi- circle. Type IV - Three triangular-shaped figures. Series III Type V - One figure of a horned animal. The maximal size of the figures in these series varies between twenty- three and six centimeters. Lumps of iron oxide found at the spot were probably used to make the paintings. At Kum Bucagi, a clue to the chronological sequence of the figures was found: two of the painted figures of the second series overlap carvings of Series I. These superpositions clearly es- tablish the fact that the engravings are older than the earliest paintings. The latest figure on the wall at Kum Bucagi is the only figure in Series III, a horned animal painted in dark red. It is stylistically isolated from the other figures and it also overlaps one of the geometric figures of Series II. To judge from the style and superposition, the horned animal of Series III should be considered apart from the other paintings on the same surface. It was apparently executed in a different period by people of another artistic and ideological approach. Because similar animal pictures are widespread in time and place, it is difficult to date Type V (Series III) by analogies to other figures. Theoretically it could belong to any period from Early Neolithic to Late Bronze Age. Lack of comparative material earlier than Neolithic is a good hint that the figure is unlikely to be earlier than Neolithic. Another important chronological clue for the Kum Bucagi figures is the discovery of three pebbles with painted figures found in a stratified position: Level C with a flint industry, a level which shows late Epi- Palaeolithic traditions with incipient Proto-Neolithic elements. The paintings on the pebbles bear patterns similar to those of the wall paintings made of iron oxide of the same color. If, as Dr. Bostanci suggests, the painted pebbles are contemporary to the Series II wall paintings, a chronological frame then exists for the wall paintings. The chronological evidence from Kum Bucagi can be summarized as follows : the earliest engravings (Series I) with their parallels to engraved figures at Öküzini may well date back to the end of the Palaeo- lithic or to an archaic Epi-Palaeolithic phase. The sec- ond series seems to belong to a final Epi-Palaeolithic or to Early Proto-Neolithic, while the third series is likely to be Neolithic and can be associated with a very broad range of analogous representations else-</page><page sequence="8">Rock engravings of ibexes as reported by Pittard near Adiyaman in a cave of uncertain location.

Kum Bucagi with its three series of wall drawings and its stratified levels, is a key site for the study of Anatolian prehis- toric rock art and together with the cave at Palanli allows us to propose a general evolution as well as a chronology for the styles of this early Anatolian art. In 1938 when Professor E. Pittard reported on a cave with prehistoric engravings near Adiyaman, he described it as a rock shelter on the road from Adi- yaman to Malatya, with three diversions, two of which contained engravings. All the figures were deer. A tracing of the figures was made and two sections of it published in Pittard' s paper. The tracings show at least seven animal figures, all drawn in contour line and lacking in details like eyes. Their style resembles the figures of Kilwa in the Jordanian Plateau and Style I from the Negev desert. In 1964, we organized a trip to Adiyaman to visit this cave. In the same area where Pittard's cave was supposed to be, we were shown, by an inhabitant of Palanli, a cave with prehistoric engravings which we thought at first was the cave described by Pittard. We did not, however, see any of the figures reproduced by Pittard and the cave we were visiting had different engravings. The location did not fit Pittard's descrip- tion precisely and our doubts increased when we con- sidered that all the figures in Pittard's cave were re- ported traced in less than one day. The cave we visited would require at least ten days of hard work for com- plete tracings! Pittard mentioned depictions only of deer in his cave and specifically reported that no an- thropomorphic figures were present. Yet in the cave we visited, though most figures are of animals, there are several anthropomorphic pictures. Pittard described only linear figures of a single style and phase, while we noticed at least four different phases, two charac- terized by figures in contour line and two made by pecking the surfaces. There are considerable differ- ences in style, and superpositions enable us to estab- lish their relative chronology. We were not able to secure Pittard's original tracings so that this puzzle could not be solved, and we do not know as yet whether the cave discovered by Pittard which we were looking for is the same as the cave we visited. Con- sidering the differences between what we saw and Pittard's descriptions and tracings, we tend to believe that there are at least two caves in the area with pre- historic engravings. The Palanli cave we examined is in the middle of a steep slope about 400 m. west of the path leading from Adiyaman to Palanli, about two kilometers be- fore reaching Palanli. Access is difficult and the use 29</page><page sequence="9">The upper part of the cave at Palanli with Epi-Palaeolithic animal figures. ANATOLIA continued of ropes is advisable. It is located on a turning point of the falaise and has two openings, one on each side of the corner crossed by the cave from south to north. It is some twenty meters long and five to ten meters wide, with all of the engravings on the eastern wall. About the center of the cave, on a higher natural platform of the rock floor, a group of deeply en- graved cup-marks strike the eye as soon as one enters the cave. Other cup-marks are scattered in various spots of the floor and the setting gives the impression of being a holy place. Our guide upon entering the cave fell to his knees and said a prayer to Allah, stating afterwards that this was the proper thing to do when reaching such a place. In the short visit paid, we counted about forty-five figures. A systematic study would probably reveal more. Of the four main phases to be seen, the earliest phase is represented by beautiful figures engraved with sure, clear, sharp, thin and accurate contour lines in a style of undoubted Epi-Palaeolithic type. A few of the animal figures are rather large (almost one meter in length) . Although some of the figures seem to form compositions, we were unable to recognize any real scene. This phase may turn out to be of para- mount importance as a link between well known, though hitherto unrelated finds: on the one hand the earliest phase shows characters very near to those of European Epi-Palaeolithic art, particularly to some Italian cave engravings from Grotta Romanelli (Otranto), Levanzo (Egadi) and Addaura (Palermo). On the other hand it undoubtedly resembles Style I of Near Eastern rock art, as exemplified by engravings from the central Negev Desert in Israel and from Kilwa in Jordan. Minor differences in style and tech- nique occur between the various engravings of this phase - a fact which may indicate the presence of sev- eral hands and possibly also of several subphases. The second and third phases, executed in the peck- ing technique, depict anthropomorphic and animal figures and stylistically resemble the third phase at Beldibi and the rock engravings at Hakkari (see be- low). The style appears to have been widespread throughout Anatolia and shows several similarities to some of the wall paintings from the Neolithic village of Çatal Hüyük. A fourth phase can be recognized on the walls of this cave in the very thin and delicate lines, some- times hardly visible, which in one case at least clearly overlap a pecked figure and thus establish a relative chronology. The thin lines depict solar symbols and other symbolic figures of types already known from Troy and elsewhere and they are likely to be con- nected to Bronze Age ideology. Each of the four rec- ognizable phases of this cave, then, suggests relations to other sites of prehistoric art both in and outside of Anatolia. The most interesting aspect of the engravings in the cave of Palanli concerns the parallel materials of the earliest phase, the carvings of Epi-Palaeolithic character. To the best of my knowledge, no other find so far presents such a clear hint of the possible origins of Near Eastern rock art. Palanli seems to indicate that we must look for European derivation and that Anatolia probably served as a land bridge for the transmission of the concepts and ideology that the fig- ures represent. The areas where Epi-Palaeolithic art has been re- reported so far in Anatolia may be considered periph- eral. Both the Antalya and Adiyaman regions are off the beaten path, hemmed in by mountains, where contacts with the central Anatolian plateau must have been difficult in prehistoric times. Similarly, Style I of Near Eastern rock art is found in the central moun- tains of the Negev Desert and at Kilwa, areas that have been typically peripheral and that had only spo- radic contacts in later periods with the main centers of civilization. Anatolian Epi-Palaeolithic art is no exception to the phenomenon that Epi-Palaeolithic art is usually located in peripheral areas which were apart from the major centers of contacts and zones of active 30</page><page sequence="10">Photograph and tracing of a group of animals from Palatili cavé.

In Italy, Epi- Palaeolithic art occurs mainly at Grotta Romanelli, in the peninsula of Otranto, at Monte Pellegrino, in Sicily and at Levanzo. In Spain, it occurs in sites like La Pileta, near Badaojan, in a remote mountain valley at the extreme south of the Iberian peninsula. Epi-Palaeolithic cave engravings appear to represent the last remnants of Palaeolithic depictions made when monumental cave art was already over in the Franco-Cantabric area and, in the main centers of Palaeolithic art, the religious concepts it embodied had been replaced by new values. Epi-Palaeolithic art may well illustrate, as I have proposed in an earlier study, a prehistoric nativistic movement which devel- oped mainly in peripheral areas among inheritors of the Palaeolithic traditions, at a period when new ideologies, based on more dynamic concepts and il- lustrating the incipient phases of a new way of life, were establishing themselves in the regions of major cultural development and of major human commerce. The last important group of rock engravings 1 shall mention was discovered in 1956 in the Sat Mountains some forty kilometers southeast of Hak- kari. A preliminary report was published in 1957 by W. Frey and M. Uyanik who have carefully surveyed the area. We have been unable to visit the site, but the report indicates a rich assemblage of rock art equal 32</page><page sequence="12">General view of the rock shelter at Kum Bucagi near Beldibi where prehistoric engravings and paintings were discovered. 33</page><page sequence="13">Rock engraving of a hunting scene from Hakkari Sat.

ANATOLIA continued in importance to the assemblages from the various mountain regions of Europe, the Near East and North Africa. The engravings are located about 2600 m. above sea level in a region which can be visited only a few months in the summer since in winter it is cut off by deep snows. The region is stony and only two economic resources are available: game for hunting and summer pastures. The setting resembles Alpine sites like Mount Bego and Toten Gebirge and prob- ably like these other similar sites, Hakkari Sat is re- lated to the cult of a "holy mountain." All around there are high peaks with rather peculiar shapes that could stimulate the imagination of prehistoric man. Resko Mountain, for example, whose summit reaches 4170 m. above sea level has the shape of a man's head framed by a collar and reminds one of the sche- matic faces of prehistoric menhir statues. Surrounded as it is by glaciers, emerging from the setting of hun- dreds of lesser peaks, it could well have been the ob- ject of prehistoric worship. The cult of holy mountains was widespread in late prehistoric and early historic times. The Alpine area has provided data (archaeological and other) about such prehistoric cults. Frequently a rich folklore sur- rounds the peak or "holy mountain." In the Near East both archaeology and ancient mythology hint of prehistoric cults connected with such holy mountains as Mount Sinai, Mount Hermon, Mount Ararat and others. Both in Europe and the Near East these holy mountains often have rock engravings in their vicinity. The rock engravings from Hakkari Sat published so far include in all thirty-seven figures; they are linear and rather schematic. Human figures are more schematic than animals and there are symbolic signs some of the most interesting of which occur also in Alpine and other European sites. Other signs resemble those common in Near Eastern rock art and early pottery decoration. A few scenes describe ani- 34</page><page sequence="14">mal hunting and trapping. Most of the traps pictured are leg-traps of types illustrated in reek art through- out the Near East. From the material available the repertory appears limited: twenty animal figures of which fifteen are deer, one a mountain goat, one per- haps a dog and three undefined. Thsre are seven an- thropomorphic figures and ten signs. Thus over half of the figures are animals and further, chiefly deer. The only probably domestic animal is a dog and the only economic activity described is hunting. A more complete series of tracings may add further data and is likely to show the presence of more than one style. The Hakkari Sat engravings have been attributed to the Early Bronze Age and parallels have been pro- vided throughout the Near East, southern Soviet Union and Anatolia. Yet until more definite informa- tion is added by the discovery of engravings depicting specific tools, weapons or datable patterns, by super- impositions, or by finding a clear archaeological con- text, the Hakkari engravings cannot be dated pre- cisely. Theoretically the chronological possibilities range from Neolithic to the Iron Age. Considering the dating of the art at Palanli and the Beldibi region, we are inclined to believe that the date should be quite early within this frame, but this is only a guess. This panoramic view makes clear the various steps in the evolution of Anatolian cave and rock art from the final Palaeolithic finds at Karain and öküzini to the later rock art in the Hakkari Mountains. Anatolia is a relatively large area and the sites of cave and rock art discovered there are up to now quite few. Most likely, when systematic surveys are undertaken, much more prehistoric art will come to light. Even now, on the basis of the material known it is possible to divide Anatolian cave and rock art into four distinct chrono- logical groups : 1. A Palaeolithic and Epi -Palaeolithic group which includes the late Palaeolithic cave engravings and mobiliáry art of Karain and öküzini, the final Palaeolithic or Epi-Palaeolithic Series I of the wall engravings of the Beldibi region and the Epi-Palaeolithic wall engravings of Series I at Palanli. The early phases of this group show clear stylistic resemblances to final Palaeolithic art from Europe ; while the Palanli group shows affinities to Style I of the rock art from the Negev Desert and from Kilwa (Jordan) . The one bone decorated object from Karain recalls the Natu- fian plastic art of Palestine. 2. A group which we consider as Proto-Neolithic, still showing strong Epi-Palaeolithic traditions, includes the second series of wall figures at Bel- dibi. This group has an approach similar to some Mesolithic European art assemblages. There are indications of parallel concepts and a way of life similar to that of "Mesolithic" European groups, although some new and more developed elements have been added. 3. A group, probably of the Neolithic period, which includes Series III of the Beldibi region, Palanli Series II and III and possibly the be- ginning of the Hakkari complex. Its parallels are with groups of rock art from the Near East and probably also to some of the wall paintings at Çatal Hüyük. 4. A group including the bulk of the Hakkari en- gravings and the paintings from Kürtün Ini which we have not discussed here. This group is post-Neolithic and may have persisted until historic times. It illustrates the continuation of a way of life typical of later hunters and seems to mark the beginning of pastoral life in the pe- ripheral areas of Anatolia. Starting from an assemblage of characteristic final Palaeolithic times, Anatolia's Earliest Art devel- ops into a style of large-sized static, outlined animal figures of typical Epi-Palaeolithic character and evolves further into depictions that are smaller and more sche- matic where the human figure grows in importance and where actual descriptive scenes are introduced into the subject matter. The same general evolution can be seen in other groups of cave and rock art in Spain, Italy and the peripheral areas of the Near East. The series of superposed phases at Beldibi and Palanli find parallel evolutions in such distant sites as La Pileta in southern Spain, Levanzo, the Addaura cave in Sicily and the central Negev in southern Israel. No doubt the discoveries surveyed here are just a small part of what remains to be found in Anatolia. Yet they show that all the main phases of prehistoric cave art and rock art are present in Asia Minor. Further research in this field will shed new light on the de- velopment of man's earliest artistic expressions. Emmanuel Anati was born in Florence, Italy in 1930.
