<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTHOLOGY IN MODERN DRESS By MARJORIE CAMBRON High School. McMinnville, Tennessee A MOST in school mythology recently SUCCESSFUL of was students, - taught not to but in lesson any our in mythology was taught in our school recently - not to any one group of students, but to the entire student body, in a chapel program sponsored by the Latin club, Senātus Populusque Romānus. I had assigned to my Vergil class the writing of a pageant in which all the major Roman deities would appear. This took much time and labor; but when it was finished we decided to have the Latin club stage it for the whole school. We called the finished product "A Lesson in Streamlined Mythology, or A Day on Mt. Olympus." To help those of our audience who had never studied Roman and Greek mythology, we pre- pared mimeographed programs listing the names of the deities, their divine claims, and the names of the students impersonat- ing them. A reader (representing a model Latin teacher of the year 1950) and a pianist (an alumna of the Latin club) furnished the background for what proved to be a very colorful pageant. Twenty-three gods and goddesses ap- peared in the performance, each of them clad in modern dress appropriate to the nature of the divinity portrayed. Jupiter, for example, was impressive in his uncle's full dress suit. Juno's white "formal" was cut on Grecian lines. Mars was in khaki, and wore a helmet left over from World War No. I. The rainbow goddess, Iris, was lovely in a long, trailing, veil- like dress of varying hues. Mischievous Cupid (borrowed from the grammar school) was on hand carrying his bow and arrows, and with his brief satin shorts supported by one criss-cross strap. Vesta, dressed as a nun, was purity itself, as she entered to strains of Ave Maria. Pluto, with his villain's moustache and black shirt, was made even more terrify- ing by a crown bearing a swastika. Bac- chus, with slouch hat and drunken swagger, was a "riot." The pageant opened as Aurora, in a fussy pink organdy dress and matching hair ribbons, ushered in the dawn. She was followed by the sun god Apollo - a Don Juan in tweeds. The pageant proceeded through the day's events. Jupiter and Juno sat on white elevated thrones and ordered the affairs of heaven and earth. Jupiter, true to his reputation, was intrigued by every pretty goddess who came his way, and kept his ox-eyed wife in a jealous frenzy. In proof of their anthropomorphic natures, the king and queen ordered nourishment early in the day. Hebe, cupbearer of the gods, attired as a French maid, proved to be too clumsy» and was forced to yield her position to Ganymede, dressed as a bell boy. Fleet Mercury, accoutered as a messenger boy, hurriedly dispatched Jupiter's urgent messages. Beautiful Venus reluctantly married the limping Vulcan, with Hymen officiating in ecclesiastical garb. Flora, of course, furnished nuptial flowers. Neptune, in beach clothes, was on hand with a pitcher of water to revive Ceres when news came that Proserpina had been kidnapped. Finally, at the close of day, stately Diana, goddess of the moon, resplendent in white net and tinsel, gathered all the deities together, and lulled them to rest around the thrones of their Majesties, Jupiter and Juno. That lesson in mythology is one the boys and girls will long remember. WWW</page></plain_text>
