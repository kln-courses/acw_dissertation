<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRANSLATING THE QUR'?N IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: DYNAMICS AND DISPUTES1 BY ROMAN LOIMEIER (University of Bayreuth) ABSTRACT In the last decades, African Muslim societies have experienced multiple processes of modernization, as, for instance, in the sphere of education. As a consequence, the number of African Muslims literate in African languages has grown tremen dously and so has the number of texts, including religious texts, published in these languages. At the same time, the Qur'?n has been translated into many African languages, and these translations of the Qur'an have triggered disputes among reli gious scholars on the translatability of the Qur3?n as well as the interpretative ori entation of these translations. The disputes over the translation and interpretation of the Qur'?n into African languages might contribute to the emergence, in sub Saharan Africa, of a tradition of scholarly debates that would stress contextualized interpretations of the text. Introduction Some years ago, Lamin Sanneh claimed that, Islam with its nontranslatable scriptures would appear to be at a considerable dis tance from the point at which Christianity engages culture. All this implies that the strength of Islam in generating a spontaneous devotion to its universal teach ings is the weakness of Christianity in its multiple local manifestations, and that, conversely, the strength of Christianity in recognizing the vernacular as a worthy medium for the transmission of the message is the weakness of Islam which excludes the vernacular from the decisive acts of faith and devotion (Sanneh 1989: 234).2 Well-known specialists in African Muslim societies, for example Murray Last, Louis Brenner, David Robinson, Tal Tamari and Dale Eickelman, have shown, however, that Islamic traditions of learning in sub-Saharan Africa were not totally unfamiliar with the 'transmission' of the message into the vernacular and that most Muslims would probably not really object to translations of the Qur5an.3 As Last and Brenner have main tained, they would rather take translations or, better, the translation of ?

This process of translating the Qur'?n and negotiating the faith occurred all over Africa as well as in other parts of the non-arabophone Islamic oecumene and was usually linked with the scholarly discipline of tafsir, the exegesis of the Qur'an.4 At the same time, some Muslim scholars, in particular, Sufi scholars, would regard translations of the Qur'?n as 'fundamentally irrelevant' to what they were seeking to provide, namely 'macrifa', the deeper knowledge {Erkenntnis) of the faith (im?n) in general and the revelation, in particular (Brenner/Last 1985: 439). Trends in 'Muslim' modernity While Islamic traditions of learning and scholarship have arguably been presented, in the past, as exclusivist and confined to small circles of scholars and their disciples, sub-Saharan Africa has been transformed, in the last thirty or forty years, in much more intensive ways than many other parts of the planet. This transformation of sub-Saharan Africa was characterized by multiple processes of modernization, urban ization, mass education, the emergence of modern civilian societies and subsequent changes in the structures of the organization of time and space. Today, sub-Saharan Africa's most prominent place is no longer the shade tree of the village but the central bus station, and time in Africa's Muslim societies is no longer marked by the adh?n, the call for prayers of the local mu'adhdhin, but by the daily programmes of a multitude of radio and TV stations. Also, the khutba, the Friday ser mon, is rendered today, in many sub-Saharan Muslim societies, in the relevant vernacular language and transmitted in national radio and TV programmes (see Tamari 1996: 49), even though Islamic prayers and the ritual are still recited and enacted in Arabic: Africa, including 'Muslim' Africa, has thus become modern in multiple, yet often incon spicuous, ways. African modernity has also become manifest in the development of a multitude of Muslim reformist organizations which express the changing religious aspirations of 'modern' Muslims and legitimize these changing perceptions of the faith in their discourses, texts as well as sermons. These reformist discourses criticize, for instance, established religious practices, such as funeral rites, marriage ceremonies, ecstatic rituals, spirit</page><page sequence="3">Translating the Qur'an in Sub-Saharan Africa 405 possession cults or supererogatory (additional, non-obligatory) prayers, which are rejected as being 'unislamic' innovations (bidac, sg. bidca) or simply dismissed as superfluous.5 Another major feature of Muslim movements of reform are their educational efforts and the emphasis they put on modern (Islamic) education, a process which has been described by Robert Launay as a move from the 'social skills' acquired in the established traditions of Islamic learning, to the 'marketable skills' offered by Muslim reformers in modern Isl?miyya-schools (Launay 1992: 93).6 These processes of transformation in Muslim education have to be seen again, however, in the context of large-scale processes of trans formation in education in post-independence sub-Saharan Africa. To make these changes transparent, some numbers should be sufficient. In Senegal, for instance, the urban population grew, between 1974 and 2004, from approximately 12% (600,000 in a population of five million) to more than 40% (four million in a population of almost nine million), while, in the same period of time, the population of the capital city and metropolitan area of Dakar/Cap Vert alone grew from 400,000 to approximately three million. Literacy also increased, in Senegal, from a level of 20% of the population in the early 1960s, to more than 60% in 2004, and more than 90% in the Cap Vert metropolitan area, an increase in absolute numbers from less than one million to more than five million, not considering literacy in Arabic, which would result in even higher proportions (see Wiegelmann 2002). In the last decades, literacy rates have grown in fact in almost all African countries (except Liberia and Somalia) from rather small percentages of 5% or less at the time of independence, to usually more than 60% of the popula tion. This growth includes countries with sizeable Muslim populations where literacy rates have reached levels of 35%-45%, for example Ethiopia, Benin, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tchad, or even more, as in Eritrea (55%), Ghana (72%), Cameroons (76%), Kenya (82%), Comoros (56%), Malawi (60%), Nigeria (64%), Sudan (58%), Tanzania (75%) or Uganda (67%) (see Hofmeier/Mehler 2004; as well as Marx 2004: 317 ff; for Senegal, specifically, see Wiegelmann 2002). At the same time, Africa has seen a media revolution, not only with respect to vibrant radio, TV and video cultures but also the internet, as well as a multitude of journals and newspapers. These journals may be printed in comparatively small numbers of some thousand or ten thousand copies only, but newspapers have a tremendous ratio of multiplication of readership in many African countries. Bilkisu Yusuf, former editor-in-chief of the New Nigerian, and, today, of The Citizen, has</page><page sequence="4">406 Roman Loimeier claimed, for, instance, that the multiplication ratio for these daily papers in Nigeria could approach a ratio of 1:25 (communication Bilkisu Yusuf, 22.4.2004), while Hamza Zubeir of the Zanzibarian newspaper Dira remarked that sale numbers for this weekly paper rose from 500 copies in early 2002 to 15,000 copies in early 2003 and assumed a multipli cation ratio of 1:6 in late 2003, when the newspaper was interdicted by the Zanzibari government for being too successful and too inves tigative (communication Hamza Zubeir, 28.8.2004). And even if many Africans are not able regularly to buy printed media, they are nonethe less part of extended networks of readers of texts of multiple character: from textbooks, daily or weekly papers, pamphlets, photo-novellas and comics, to internet pages. Muslim movements of reform7 have been closely connected with these processes of modernization, as well as with the movement towards mass literacy and mass education. In fact, most African Muslim movements of reform have been, from their very beginning, movements of educa tion: this is not only true for contemporary movements such as the Jam?cat Iz?lat al-Bidca wa-Iq?mat as-Sunna (Hausa: 5Yan ?zala) in Nigeria and Niger, the Jam?cat cIb?d ar-Rahm?n in Senegal or the different groups of the Ans?r as-Sunna in East Africa, but also for ear lier generations of reform as represented by Shaykh al-Am?n b. cAli al Mazr?c? (d. 1947) and Shaykh cAbdall?h S?lih al-Fars? (d. 1982) in East Africa, Abubakar Gumi (d. 1992) in Nigeria and Cheikh Tour? in Senegal (see Loimeier 1997, 2001 and 2003) or the so-called Wahh?b? movement in Mali and Ivory Coast and the Harakat al-Fal?h as founded by Shaykh Mahmud B? in both Senegal and Mali (see Brenner 2001, Kaba 1974 and Miran 1998). Equally, Muslim reformers have started to write for a mass market and have realized the opportunities pro vided by modern media for the propagation of their ideas (see Soares 2005). Muslim movements of reform have, thus, produced in the respec tive vernacular languages millions of pamphlets, polemical texts, cas settes and videos, as well as homepages and internet chat-rooms. This development has to be seen as a major break with the past when Muslim scholars wrote for a comparatively small audience, mostly other scholars, even if these traditions of learning acquired consider able recognition in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond. On the East African coast and parts of the Sudanic belt of sub-Saharan West Africa as well as in Ethiopia, Muslim scholars have produced texts in Arabic (as well as some few in African languages) since at least the thirteenth century. Most of these texts have been linked, as the volumes of Arabic Literature of Africa show, with religious disciplines (Qur'?n, fiqh/law, tasawwuf/</page><page sequence="5">Translating the Qufan in Sub-Saharan Africa 407 Sufism, cilm al-falak/astronomy-astrology, hadrth/prophetic traditions, tawhrd/dogmatic theology, tafsir/exegesis, and language-related disciplines, as well as tibb an-nabr/prophetic medicine). The only exception to this rule were historical accounts (chronicles, family histories, local histories) as well as geographies and itineraries, in particular, those on pilgrimage routes, which seem to have been an accepted part of sub-Saharan Muslim scholarship since the sixteenth century. From the eighteenth century, the absolute number of texts written in Arabic by African Muslim authors, as well as those written in African languages such as KiSwahili, Hausa and Fulfulde in the respective "ajamf alphabets,8 has increased considerably in the context of the movements of jih?d in the bil?d as-s?d?n of sub-Saharan West Africa as Muslim scholars tried to present and to legitimize their respective religious and political positions in texts (Hunwick 1995: 4; Levtzion/Pouwels 2000: 12 and Robinson 2000: 134). Only in the twentieth century, however, have African Muslim authors started to write and publish texts in African vernacular languages for numerically much larger and predominantly non-scholarly audiences on fundamental issues such as caq?da, im?n, talq?n, i.e. catechisms and confessions, the interpretation of the holy texts, as well as the most banal questions of everyday life, in addition to polemics against Sufi brotherhoods, the Ahmadiyya movement-in-Islam, international capi talism, Zionism, imperialism and crusaderism, or, again, rather specific popular practices such as the celebration of the mawlid an-nabi, the birthday of the prophet, or funeral ceremonies, which are often con nected with local traditions of 'conspicuous consumption' and popular festivities, or finally, a plethora of fat?wa, legal opinions on questions of everyday life. In addition, texts of a non-religious character have become increasingly important. A religious scholar from Zaria, cUmar b. Ibrahim b. Ahmad b. cUmar al-W?lr (b. 1922) has published, for instance, since the 1950s, poems of praise on the achievements of Charles Darwin, William Shakespeare and the astronomer Edmond Halley, while another Nigerian scholar, cIs? Alabi Abu Bakr from llor?n, wrote about rather diverse themes such as the crash of a pilgrims' air plane near Kano in 1977 or the contents of Colonel Mucammar al Qadhdh?fi's 'green book'. Also, cAbd as-Sal?m Alkinla from llor?n (b. 1960) wrote a poem in the 'l?miyya'-verse-style on the work of the BBC, while cAbd ar-Rahm?n cAbd al-cAzfz az-Zakawf (b. 1965) came to write, in 1989, a 'y?'iyya' poem titled 'qasrda cal? l-cutla' on the importance of leisure times and holidays (see Hunwick 1995: 532). This development towards non-religious themes in text production (beyond</page><page sequence="6">408 Roman Loimeier the academic topics mentioned above) started relatively early in East Africa, probably the late nineteenth century, while the first non-reli gious texts (mostly poems) were published in northern Nigeria only in the 1930s (see the volumes of Arabic Literature of Africa, ALA I, II and III as edited by John Hunwick and S.R. O'Fahey). Muslim reformers have thus been in the forefront of 'African moder nity' for some time and have also conquered today the modern media and 'modern (Muslim) audiences'.9 In the process of conquering new audiences, Muslim reformers have not remained confined to urban agglomerations but have also reached the rural areas. Robert Launay was able to witness the impact of a Muslim preacher and reformer in Koko, northern Ivory Coast, in the mid-1980s: One such man passed through Koko in 1985 and delivered a sermon. Local Dyula, particularly those educated in French, were impressed. It was pointed out to me that he could pronounce Arabic in the way Arabs do?the mass media have famil iarized Dyula with 'Arab' Arabic pronunciation?and not with the heavy accent of locally trained scholars. He read texts fluently out loud?rather than reciting them from memory?and could comment readily on the meanings of different words, glossing them in Dyula with greater ease, in the opinion of his audience, than could local scholars (Launay 1992: 192). However, the processes of social, economical and cultural modernization in Africa have not only brought the mobile phone or short-wave radio into the remotest areas of the continent, but also changed the charac ter and outlook of religious movements, Christian and Muslim alike, in urban as well as rural Africa. These changes are brought about not only by the media revolution itself, but by the interface between the media revolution and the movement towards mass literacy and mass education mentioned above. This movement towards mass education is unprecedented in African history, and has had considerable repercussions on religious culture, as it is linked with new approaches to texts and translations of texts, both sacred and secular. Mass production of texts, the diversification of media use, the culti vation of non-religious themes in sub-Saharan traditions of learning in the twentieth century, literacy campaigns and increasing literacy in African vernacular languages have contributed thus to the explosion of text production in African languages as well as the translation of vast amounts of Arabic (religious) texts into vernacular languages, in addition to English and French, and their subsequent commercialization on a mass level. This process has led, in the last decades, to a significant change of the role of Arabic. The well known East African reformer, Shaykh cAbdall?h S?lih al-Farsi (1912-82), has, in fact, argued in this</page><page sequence="7">Translating the Qur'an in Sub-Saharan Africa 409 context that 'Islam does not want colonialism in religion, Arabic is not at all necessary' ('Uislamu hautaki istimaari wa dini, si lazima lugha ya Kiarabu', as quoted in Lacunza Balda 1993: 233). Through the intensification of contacts between sub-Saharan Muslim societies and Arab countries through trade, the increasing number of students in Arab countries and the impact of modern media such as satellite operated TV programmes like 'al-Jazira', familiarity with the Arab lan guage has indeed acquired new notions: Arabic has become in the eyes of many young Muslims in particular a secular language. In the context of increasing literacy in African languages, Arabic has also lost, however, its status as the major language for the production of Islamic religious texts as literacy usually implied literacy in national languages such as Wolof and Bambara or transnational languages such as KiSwahili and Hausa. These languages represent, today, an increas ing market of readers and buyers, while Arabic has remained the lan guage of a small scholarly elite only. Gerard C. van de Bruinhorst was able to point out thus that 30% of the (700) titles he collected in about thirty local (Islamic) bookshops in ten East African urban centers were written in Arabic, while approximately 50% were written in KiSwahili and an astonishing 20% in English (van de Bruinhorst 2001: 6). Similar observations can be made for Senegal and northern Nigeria where an increasing number of 'Islamic' texts is published in either French or English, or national languages of communication such as Wolof or Hausa (see Loimeier 1997 and 2001). Religious scholars who aspire to mass readership (and corresponding commercial success) have conse quently stopped writing in Arabic and switched to the respective local, national and transnational languages. Still, Arabic has retained some vestiges of 'sacrality': Muslims still appreciate the importance of Arabic as an intrinsic part of 'proper' Islamic education and schools that pro vide Arabic language skills are still popular, even in modern urban con texts. In addition, Arabic has retained some of its 'talismanic' usages in modern contexts such as sports, in particular, football, when imams are asked to recite, before a match starts, the 's?rat an-nasr' (the s?ra of victory),10 or when we look at the widespread acceptance of amulets, which are even exported, by African pilgrims, to Saudi Arabia.11 Despite the growth of Muslim reformist movements, established religious schol ars were, thus, able to retain part of their authority in important niches of social development.</page><page sequence="8">410 Roman Loimeier Translations of the Qur'an Processes of modernization and social change have also affected estab lished traditions of Islamic learning and the reception of the Qur5?n, in particular.12 A significant feature of Muslim reform in sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, was that Muslim reformers, as the 'translators' of our times in their respective societies, have claimed that every believer should be able to read the Qur'an and even to interpret the Qur'?n in an autonomous way, not influenced by mediators, the experts of reli gious knowledge or Sufi shaykhs. Muslim movements of reform indeed stress independent access to texts and have supported, as a consequence, since the early twentieth century, the translation of the Qur'?n into African vernacular languages: Abubakar Gumi and Nasiru Kabara have translated the Qur5?n into Hausa, cAbdall?h S?lih al-Fars? into KiSwahili, Oumar Ba into Fulfulde, Ibrahim Niass and Path? Diagne into Wolof and there are a number of further translations into Yoruba, Kikuyu and other African languages, such as Kiganda and Kikuyu,13 Zulu and Afrikaans,14 as well as numerous partial translations of some s?ras only.15 Most of these translations have been presented as being part of the efforts of individual scholars to 'improve' the religious knowledge and the educational standards of Muslims. The East African reformer, "Abdallah S?lih al-Fars?, has commented thus on his translation of the Qur'?n: 'Kama mwislamu, nimeona ya kuwa ni wajibu wangu kuki fasiri kitabu hiki kwa lugha ya kiswahili. Kwani watu wengi wana hamu ya kuyajua yaliyomo ndani yake' ('As a Muslim I am aware that it is my duty to translate this book into kiswahili as many people earnestly desire to know what is inside', quoted in Lacunza Balda 1989: 26). These translations of the Qur'?n have to be seen, however, in an historical context of disputes on the question of 'translatability' of the sacred text as such, and its subsequent interpretation in languages other than Arabic. Disputes concerning the translation of the Qur'?n started, thus, rather early in East Africa. In 1923, Canon Godfrey Dale of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), who lived in Zanzibar from 1889-1925, managed to complete a first translation into KiSwahili under the title 'Tafsiri ya Kurani ya Kiarabu kwa lugha ya Kiswahili pamoja na dibaji na maelezo machache' (Translation of the Quran from Arabic into Kiswahili together with an introduction and some explanations; re-edited in 1931). The chief purpose of the translation was to help missionaries, teachers and Christians to 'understand Islam'. Yet, Muslims quickly rejected this text, and disputes between Muslims and Christians in Tanzania on the issue of this translation occurred as</page><page sequence="9">Translating the Qur'?n in Sub-Saharan Africa 411 late as 1992 and 1993 (see Lacunza Balda 1997: 99; Mbogoni 2004: 87), even though Christian translations of the Qur'an (in contrast to Ahmadr translations of the Qur'an) are not even seen as 'proper' trans lations by many Muslims, as Christian translations, for example the Dale translation, usually fail to include the Arabic text (Lacunza Balda 1989: 53).16 Another major reason for the rejection of the Dale trans lation may have been the fact that Canon Dale had written a number of other texts in Kiswahili including 'Maisha ya Muhammad' (The Life of Muhammad), as well as 'Khabari za dini ya Kiislamu kwa mukhtasari pamoja na maelezo ya ikhtilafu zilizopo kati ya dini ya Kiislamu na y a Kikristo' (Summary of the religion of Islam with an explanation of the differences between Islam and Christianity), a text which sought to provide Christian teachers of religion with arguments against Islam as well as against the Muslim critique of Christian theological positions like the idea of the trinity (Mbogoni 2004: 73-81). As a consequence, Dale's work was seen, by many Muslims, as a polemic against Islam and his translation of the Qur'an was seen as being part of such a polemic. The next translation of the Qur'an, namely, the translation of the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam, did not gain more acceptance. This translation, entitled 'Kurani Tukufu pamoja na tafsiri na maelezo kwa kiswahili', was undertaken, from 1936, by Mubarak Ahmad Ahmadr. He was the r?'is at-tabhgh (head of mission) of the Ahmadiyya in East Africa and had completed the transcript by 1942. After some amend ments, the text was published in 1953 (a second and a third edition were published in 1971 and 1981). The Ahmadiyya translation con sidered the Dale translation, yet criticized it (wrongly) as 'Dale knew no Arabic' (Lacunza Balda 1989: 58).17 With its translation of the Qur'?n, the Ahmadiyya movement wanted to fight against the increas ing presence and success of the Christian missionary movements in East Africa. On account of the rather unorthodox teachings of its founder, Mirz? Ghul?m Ahmad, the movement was regarded, however, by most Muslims as heretical. Consequently, the Ahmadr translation of the Qur'?n did not find broad support in East Africa.18 Eventually, a third translation of the Qur'?n into Kiswahili was started by the first major representative of Islamic reform in East Africa, Shaykh al-Amfn b. cAh~ al-Mazrucr (1891-1947), as a conscious reac tion to the Ahmadr translation. Shaykh al-Amin managed to translate, however, only a small part of the Qur'?n until his death, and his work had to be carried on by one of his students, Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Fars?, who published those parts of the work he had completed, in</page><page sequence="10">412 Roman Loimeier Mwongozi, a weekly journal in Zanzibar, until he was able to present the whole text under the title 'Qurani Takatifu' in 1969 (Glassman 2000: 410).19 Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Farsfs translation of the Qur'?n also did not find undivided support, however. In particular, the scholars connected with the 'Alawf tradition of learning (see Bang 2003) and their spiritual center in Lamu, the rib?t ar-riy?da, under the leadership of the sons, grandsons and nephews of Sharif Habib S?lih (1853-1935), refused to acknowledge Shaykh cAbdall?h S?lih al-Farsfs translation and to thereby implicitly accept his claim to spiritual superiority and right guidance (irsh?d) in Kenya (Lacunza Balda 1997: 113 and 1993: 234): The Kenyan scholarly establishment in fact responded to al-Farsi's translation with a text entided 'Fimbo ya Musa' (Musa's stick) by Ahmad al-Badawi Jamal al-Layl who rejected the theological positions of Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Farsi (Lacunza Balda 1989: 235-7).20 The different Christian and Ahmadr translations of the Qur5?n in East Africa, but also in other parts of the continent, in particular, Nigeria and South Africa, have thus triggered off a series of 'reactive translations' of the Qur'?n into African languages which were justified as providing Muslims with 'proper Muslim' translations of the Qur'?n. These reactive translations of the Qur5?n have led, in a secondary reac tion, to internal disputes among Muslims and a subsequent series of 're-interpretative translations'. Even if they saw the necessity of presenting a reactive translation to Christian or Ahmadi translations of the Qur'?n, followers of Sufi brotherhoods, for instance, were rather unwilling to accept the interpretative orientation linked with reactive translations of well-known reformist scholars such as Abubakar Gumi or Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Farsi as well as their implicit claim to irsh?d which was expressed in their translations of the Qur'?n. Reformist reactive translations such as those of Abubakar Gumi or Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Farsr were consequently answered by re-interpretative translations of religious scholars such as Shaykh Nasiru Kabara21 in Nigeria or 'All Muhsin al-Barwan?22 in East Africa who were often, but not always, linked with Sufi brotherhoods. The business of translating and, subsequently, interpreting the Qur5?n has thus acquired unknown dimensions in sub-Saharan Africa.23 At the same time, translations of the Qur5?n into African languages have found general acceptance among the Muslim populations of sub-Saharan Africa and have been printed in considerable numbers24 with the financial support of the R?bitat al-'?lam al-Islam? (the Muslim World League, as based in Saudi-Arabia), the Jam'iyyat ad-Da'wa al-Islam?ya (the Society for the Propagation of Islam, as based in Libya), the Africa</page><page sequence="11">Translating the Qur'?n in Sub-Saharan Africa 413 Muslim Agency (as based in Kuwait),25 or other 'Northern' Muslim organizations in Egypt, in the Emirates, Iran, in Pakistan and in Turkey. The fact that the number of Muslims literate in African languages (often through the efforts of Christian missions), as well as in French and English, has virtually exploded in the last decades, and that literacy in African languages has spread widely in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and has also transformed the character of approach to the Qur'?n.26 Knowledge of the Qur'?n, beyond the pure mnemotechnical mastery of the text or parts of it, is not restricted any more to a small elite of linguistically and theologically well-trained culam?', but has become 'democratized' in the context of Muslim mass education. At the same time, the established scholars have lost part of their 'Deutungshegemonie', their 'hegemonic power of interpretation and definition', as translators, as well as their exclusive social role as religious experts and intermediaries of religious and sacred knowledge in the processes of modernization mentioned above. Brenner and Last have consequently concluded in the 1980s, that, 'if translation becomes an adequate way for everyone to read the Koran, then grassroots malams are increasingly redundant' (Brenner/Last 1985: 439). Even if we have to concede from hindsight that this prognosis has not yet quite come true, as 'grassroots malams' seem to be rather ingenious with respect to the cultivation of social and religious niches (see above), the rise of Muslim reformist movements has brought about, in the last decades, a relative decline of the social and religious influence of established religious scholars as well as an increasing fragmentation of religious authority. With the translation of the Qur'?n into African languages, the Qur'?n has, in fact, acquired new meanings in different social milieux: it has ceased to be a sacred icon only, a venerated source of blessing (Levtzion 1979: 210), to be recited to audiences, in Arabic, according to the proper rules of tajwrd,27 and has also become a 'secular' text, read and (mis)interpreted by millions of Muslims literate in cajami (non-Arabic) literatures such as KiSwahili, Hausa, Wolof or Afrikaans.28 The different translations of the Qur'?n into African languages have, consequently, generated a heated debate not only on the translatability of the Qur'?n, but also the interpretative orientation of these translations, as they seem to acquire new meanings in the process of translation, as each trans lation is connected with a process of interpretation. This process has again led to theological debates over the question as to what translation actually implies with respect to the sacred character of the text.29 According to established Muslim views, as expressed by the major exponents of the M?likr, Sh?ficr and Hanaf? schools of law, the word</page><page sequence="12">414 Roman Loimeier of God (kal?m Allah) could in fact not be translated at all into lan guages other than Arabic as the sacredness of the Qur'?n rested in the words themselves and not in their meaning. Translations into other lan guages would, consequently, cease to be the word of God, and the sacredness of the text would be lost.30 Yet, the essential translatability of the Qur'?n has always been a matter of dispute among scholars. While arabophone scholars have pointed out the 'inimitable and won drous' (i'j?z) character of the revelation, non-arabophone scholars have stressed the importance of s?ra 12:2 ('We have revealed the Qur5?n? anzaln?hu?in the Arabic tongue so that you may grow in under standing') which shows that 'understanding' ('aq?l, in this case, i.e. intelligent, reasonable understanding) through the medium of an 'under standable language' (i.e. Arabic) is a basic intention of the revelation. Such an interpretation of s?ra 12:2 has subsequently supported early translations of the Qur'?n into languages such as Persian, even if schol ars still claim that translations into other languages than Arabic should be called 'translations of the meaning (and not of the words as such) of the Qur'?n' (tarjama ma'?ni 1-Qur5?n) (see Bobzin 1999: 118 f). In sub-Saharan Africa, the question of the implications of transla tions arises now in a particular pertinent manner, as millions of literate Muslims are perfectly able today to read the Qur'?n in, for instance, KiSwahili or Hausa. However, these literate Muslims are no longer necessarily trained as 'ulam?5 and, consequently, not learned in the dis ciplines of Qur3?nic exegesis such as, for instance, Arabic linguistics. Their approach to the Qur5?n is often scripturalist and prone to mis interpretations and misunderstandings, in particular, when it comes to the proper understanding and interpretation of the meaning of specific ay?t (verses) and s?ras of the Qur'?n. 'Ulam?5 would, for instance, maintain that for a proper understanding of a specific aya it would not only be necessary to know the location (Mecca or Medina) of the rev elation as such, but to be also familiar with the 'asb?b an-nuz?l', the reasons (or 'occasions') for the revelation, and the rules of 'an-n?sikh wa-1-mans?kh', the abrogation of earlier verses by later verses (revela tions). In addition, scholars should be aware of the interrelatedness (mun?saba) of the individual verses and revelations as well as the differentiation between 'unclear' and 'clear' (al-jum?d wa-1-wud?h) or 'general' and 'specific' (al-'?mm wa-1-kh?ss) passages in the Qur5?n. Another important tool for the interpretative analysis and understand ing of the Qur'?n is the idea of the metaphysically manifest (z?hir) as well as the hidden (b?tin) meanings of the Qur'?n.31 Knowledge and interpretation of the asb?b an-nuz?l as well as other methods of access</page><page sequence="13">Translating the Qur'?n in Sub-Saharan Africa 415 and analysis for the interpretation of the Qur'?n are now almost as old as the Qur'?n and their cultivation forms part of a large spectrum of exegetical disciplines. The development of this qan?n of exegetical disciplines (tafsfr, nahw/grammar, lugha/language, etc.) again has to be seen as a scholarly effort to provide a 'narrative situation' into which an interpretation of the Qur'?n could be embodied for exegetical reasons (Rippin 1985: 153). The ultimate aim of these endeavours of interpre tation was to contextualize the meaning of the Qur'?n by linking the text with the context of the revelation and to obtain, thus, a contex tualized interpretation and understanding of the sacred text in Arabic. The majority of 'modern' literate Muslims in Africa (and other parts of the Islamic oecumene) is often not aware, however, of the intrica cies of Qur'?nic exegesis, the different types and styles of exegesis, the rules of mun?saba and abrogation, or the respective asb?b an-nuz?l of specific ay?t of the Qur'?n,32 and many Muslims, in particular, those linked with radical activist organizations, reject contextualized transla tions and interpretations, as a contextualized or allegoric (ta'wil)33 read ing of the Qur'?n opens interpretative spaces for multiple readings of the text. Such an openness of the revelation for many, even contradictory, interpretations is perceived as irritating in a situation of crisis. In such a situation, clear and seemingly simple readings of the revelation are preferred, in particular when they seem to support a specific political reading of the Qur'?n which is important again for the legitimization of radical religio-political positions. A purely literal understanding of the Qur'?n may be instrumental thus for intended misunderstandings and, consequently, for the management of conflict, while contextualized translations, which stress the importance of the asb?b an-nuz?l or the interrelatedness of specific verses as well as the preceding traditions of interpretation and their results, in addition to the importance of proper skills in Arabic linguistics, are rather less prone, though not immune, to the instrumentalization of the sacred text for political means. We should be aware in this context, however, of the danger of over interpretation by reading 'politics' into any kind of theological discussion. Many Muslims in East Africa did, thus, not understand why Shaykh cAbdall?h S?lih al-Farsr, who had come to be known in Kenya, in the 1970s, for his pro-Wahh?bi positions34 and his close links with Saudi Arabia, rejected, in his translation of the Qur'?n, the literalist Wahh?br interpretation of a number of ay?t of the Qur'?n known for their anthropomorphic connotation. The ay?t in question are Qur'?n 7:54 (al-acr?f: Inna rabbakum all?hu alladhi khalaqa as-sam?w?t wa-l-ard fi sitta ay?min thumm? istaw? cal? lJarsh', your Lord is God, who created</page><page sequence="14">416 Roman Loimeier the Heavens and the earth in six days and (then) ascended His throne), as well as 10:3 (Y?nis); 20:5 (T?'h?); 25:59 (al-furq?n); 32: 4 (as-saj dah) and 57:4 (al-hadrd). In each of these ay?t, the verb 'istaw?' (form VIII of the verb sawiya, i.e. crU {Sy**\, 'to sit down') could be trans lated either in a rather literal sense as God actually sitting down on his 'throne' (as in the verb 'istaqarra'), or, in a metaphorical/allegoric (taVfl) sense as God 'settling down, establishing himself in order to rule', as an allegoric expression for God's almightiness.35 Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Fam translated the aya quoted above (7:54) as 'Hakika Mola wenu ni Mwenyezi Mungu, aliyeziumba mbingu na ardhi kwa siku sita, kisha akatawala juu y a Arshi Take\ employing, thus, the verb 'ku-tawala' (to reign, rule, govern) and translating the verse thereby as 'then (after having created the Heavens and the earth) he governed/ruled/reigned on his throne'. Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Farsi repeated this translation in verses 10:3; 25:59 and 32:4 as 'kisha akatawala juu ya arshi yake', except in 20:5, where he translated 'aliyetawala juu ya kiti chake' (then he ruled on/from his chair) and 57:4, where he rendered the verse as 'kisha akakaa katika Enzi (yake) (then he settled down and started to reside in his empire/dominion)' (see al-Farsi 1982: 205), remaining, thus, consistently true to the established consensus, which had always interpreted these verses in an allegoric way (com munications 'Abd al-Wahh?b 'Alaw? 'Abd al-Wahh?b Jamal al-Lail, 2.3.2003 and Yunus Sameja, 27.2.2003).36 Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Fars?'s rejection of the literal translation of these verses and his insistence on an allegoric interpretation was not interpreted, now, by his followers as well as his opponents in Kenya, as a purely (but well-founded) theological choice, but was rather seen, by both his followers and his opponents, as a manifestation of Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Farsfs rejection of a major Wahhab? tenet of faith and, thus, implicitly, as a rejection of Saudi politics, a political turn expressed in a religious code, motivated by Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al Farsr's alleged (and somehow enigmatic) late-life-opposition to Saudi politics and 'Wahh?bl Islam': Shaykh 'Abdallah S?lih al-Farsfs followers (and opponents) were virtually unable to see a theological argument as a theological argument. Conclusion On account of the potential of (mis)understanding and (misinter pretation of the sacred text in political contexts, Muslim reformers, such as Nasr Hamid Ab? Zaid, have come to re-emphasize the importance</page><page sequence="15">Translating the Qufan in Sub-Saharan Africa 417 of linguistics as a precondition to an interpretation of the Qur'?n,37 and they differentiate between the simple reading and the interpretation of the holy text. Some Muslim reformers have consequently modified their position with respect to the approach to the Qur'?n. While they still maintain that all Muslims should be able to read the Qur'?n, even in their own language, these scholars have also realized that a proper interpretation of the Qur'?n should be confined to the culam?' or those scholars who have the linguistic skills (in Arabic) to translate the Qur'?n not only as a text but as a contextualized message.38 These efforts to re-contextualize the translation and interpretation of the Qur'?n could be seen as an important effort to re-establish the 'Deutungshegemonie' of the scholars in a period of time, when scholarly authority is increas ingly threatened by processes of modernization. At the same time, this new stage in the dialectics of religious discussions and disputes on the issue of the translation and interpretation of the Qur'?n might lead to a reassertion of the theological and intellectual dimensions of religious debates. Such a development could be of paramount importance in times when religion is read as a function of politics and consequently instrumentalized for apologetic purposes.

I would like to thank the participants in the section on 'Religion in Africa' of the German African Studies Association meeting in Hannover (5 June 2004), in particular, Abdulkader Tayob and Klaus Hock, as well as the participants in the seminar series on "ulam?5 in society and history' at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, Oxford (24 November 2004), in particular, James Piscatori, Muhammad T?lib, Georg Deutsch and Zulfiqar Hirji, for their comments. Finally, I am grateful for David Robinson's irsh?d. 2. This argument is curious even within a Christian context: the Catholic Church, cultivating Latin as language of ritual until only recently and thus similarily excluding 'the vernacular from decisive acts of faith and devotion', has nevertheless managed to develop on a truly global scale. 3. L. Brenner and M. Last 1985: 439; see also D. Robinson 2004: 12; T. Tamari 1996: 45 if and D. Eickelman 1997: 43 ff. 4. For the presentation of a local tradition of tafs?r in Mali see T. Tamari 1996, 45 ff; for Nigeria see Madigawa 1978; for the development of contemporary traditions of tafsir see Jansen 1980. 5. For a general overview over reformist discourses see Loimeier 2003, for a local example (Ivory Coast) see Miran 1998. 6. For the development of modern Islamic education in Mali see Brenner 2001; for Nigeria see Reichmuth 1998; for Senegal see Loimeier 2001. 7. I would like to define 'reform' here as 'change with a programme'. Such an inclu sive definition of reform has two major advantages: it includes a large spectrum of different movements of reform and does not exclude Sufi-oriented movements and tra ditions of reform which have often been neglected in the analysis of Muslim movements of reform. In addition, the definition of reform as 'change with a programme' includes movements of reform which do not necessarily claim to have a modernizing orienta tion (even if set in 'Muslim modernity') but claim, for instance, to revigorate the faith. In that sense, the term reform would also correspond to the Arabic equivalent of the term, namely tajd?d (renewal) or islah (improvement). For a general discussion of Muslim movements of reform in subsaharan Africa see Loimeier 2003 and 2005. 8. cAjamI alphabets of Arabic for the respective vernacular African languages could</page><page sequence="19">Translating the Qwfan in Sub-Saharan Africa 421 be much older than the 18th century. These alphabets were of particular importance for the esoteric disciplines of Islamic learning, such as cilm al-falak, astrology, astron omy, numerology, geomancy and others (see Brenner 2000: 153 if and Dilley 2004: 178 ff; on the talismanic use of Arabic see Ham?s 1997). 9. For similar expressions of Muslim modernity in Arab/Near/Middle Eastern con texts see Eickelman/Piscatori 1996 or Eickelman/Anderson 1997. 10. In Tanzania, football clubs have started to travel with their own spiritual heal ers, 'sorcerers' and talismanic experts of the Qur'an, and have triggered a nationwide competion of different categories of 'spiritual advisors' (communication Mohamed Saleh, 3.4.2005). 11. See Loimeier 1997 and 2000; see also Robinson 2004: 44 f. 12. For a detailed analysis of these established traditions of Islamic learning in sub Saharan Africa see, for instance; Fortier (1997) for Mauritania; Ciss? (1992), Tamari (1996) and Brenner (2001) for Mali; Ndiaye (1985) and Loimeier (2001, 2002) for Senegal; Reichmuth (1998) for Nigeria; Meunier (1997) for Niger; Santerre (1973) for the Cameroons and Ziddy (2001) for Zanzibar; for a general overview see Wilks (1975), Eickelman (1978) and Grandin/Gaboriau (1997). 13. See Tamari 1996: 46. 14. The translation into Zulu was undertaken by the Islamic Propagation Center of Ahmed Deedat (and based on the Deobandi translation of the Qur5?n by Y?suf cAh~ (communication Goolam Vahed, 11.9.2004). The translation into Afrikaans was under taken by the Ahmadiyya movement (communication Goolam Vahed, 11.9.2004). The first translation of Arabic religious texts into Afrikaans was initiated by an Ottoman Q?dr, Abubakar Effendi, who had come to Cape Town in 1862, in order to mediate in communal conflicts. His major text, entitled Bay?n ud-D?n ('the eludication of reli gion', publ. 1874) was a translation of a major Hanafi legal text, Multaq? al-abhar ('the most magnificent meeting place') by Burh?n du-D?n Ibrahim b. Muhammad al-Halab? (d. 1549). The Arabic script Abubakar Effendi used for his translation of the text into Afrikaans had been developed by the Cape Muslim community in the 1850s (see Loimeier 1999: 92 and Brandel-Syrer 1960). 15. These translations were either published in the respective Arabic script of an African language as developed for Hausa, Wolof, KiSwahili or Afrikaans, or in the Latin script as developed, by Christian missionary organizations, for many African languages, in the 19th and 20th centuries. 16. Translations into Kiswahili, as undertaken by scholars from the mainland, are often seen, from a Zanzibari perspective, as biased on account of alleged Christian mis sion influences on the mainland dialects of KiSwahili (communication Abdul Sheriff, 18.6.2004). 17. In fact, Godfrey Dale held a chair of Arabic studies in both Oxford and Cambridge (communication J. Lacunza Balda, 2.4.2005). 18. Even if the Ahmadiyya was rather successful, as a social and religious movement of reform in both East and West Africa in the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s. Opposition to the Ahmadiyya movement became widespread, however, since the 1960s and 1970s, in sub-Saharan Africa as well as the Islamic oecumene. For a general overview over anti-Ahmadr polemics see Schulze 1990: 362 ff; for a history of the Ahmadiyya in West Africa see Fisher 1963; for anti-Ahmadr campaigns in Nigeria see Loimeier 1997: 159 ff. 19. The introduction to editions 2-7 of Kurani Takatifu was written by a friend of al-Farsi, namely the founder and leader of the Pakistani reform movement of the Jamcryat-i-Isl?mi, Abu 1-?cl? Maud?df, who had started and led the campaign against the Ahmadiyya movement in Pakistan and who had managed, in the 1970s, to get the Ahmadiyya declared a non-Islamic sect in Pakistan (Bakari 1989: 5). 20. For comparable disputes over the translation of the Qur'?n in the Nigerian con text see Brigaglia 2004. 21. Nasiru Kabara's tafsfr was published in 1988. In 1993, a third translation of the</page><page sequence="20">422 Roman Loimeier Qur'?n into Hausa was published by Shaykh N?sir Mustafa, Ust?dh Bello Sacrd and Ust?dh Tij?ni Y?suf (see Brigaglia 2004). 22. cAlf Muhsin al-Barw?nf's translation of the Qur'?n (Qur'ani takufu) was pub lished in 1998. In addition, there exist, in East Africa alone, at least twelve partial trans lations of the Qur'?n, mostly of the s?rat al-fatiha (Lacunza Balda 2005: 1). 23. In this context, it would be interesting to see which works of tafs?r served as models for the respective translations of the Qur'?n into African languages. Recently, Andrea Brigaglia (University of Naples) has been working on this question with respect to Hausa translations of the Qur'?n. 24. So far, Kurani Takatifu has seen, since 1969, six editions of between 5.000 (1971) and 36.000 (1984) and a total of c. 108.000 copies (Lacunza Balda 1989: 104). 25. For the activities of the 'Africa Muslim Agency' see Morier-Genoud 2002, for the 'R?bita' see Schulze 1990, for the Jamciyyat ad-Dacwa al-Isl?miyya' see Mattes 1995. 26. Muhammad Sani cUmar comes to a similar conclusion in his analysis of a poem of Malam Mucazu Hadejia in Northern Nigeria (cUmar 2002: 97). 27. The scholastic discipline for the proper recitation of the Qur'?n in, for instance, the different harak?t (speeds) and pitches. 28. For corresponding processes of 'profanisation' of the Qur'?n in contemporary arabophone Muslim societies see Schulze 2005: 98 ff. 29. A similar debate on the consequences of translation was led in 16th-century Europe, when the Bible, as translated from Latin or Greek into Europe's vernacular languages, became accessible to a wider audience, a development that triggered off com ments like that of John Dryden in England on the business of translations and inter pretations: 'The Book thus put in every vulgar hand/which each presumed he best could understand/the common rule was made the common prey/and at the mercy of the rabble lay' (quoted in McGrath 2003: 157). In Germany, the task and right of inter pretation of the Bible was eventually restricted to the pastors by the end of the 1520s, and only a minority of 'protestants' stuck to the original claim that the interpretation of the Scripure should be possible for all (McGrath 2003: 165). 30. Anne Bang has stressed this point with respect to her discussion of early trans lations of the Qur'?n into Kiswahili (Bang 2003: 184). 31. For a detailed discussion of these approaches to interpretation as well as the dis cussion of the different notions of the term revelation, in the sense of either 'nuz?l', 'the coming down of the revelation', or 'wahy', 'revelation as a process of communi cation between God and man through the Prophet', see Kermani 1996: 64 ff. For an extended and rather recent debate on dynamics of translation and interpretation see Luxenberg 2004 and the contributions in Burgmer 2005. 32. Miran has pointed out the weakness in theological argumentation of Wahh?bi oriented reformist Muslims in Ivory Coast (Miran 1998: 20). 33. The term ta'w?l has been interpreted differently in history: while being under stood to mean 'interpretation' as such originally, it came to depict the allegoric inter pretation of the Qur'?n in later periods of Islamic scholarship and has acquired the notion of arbitrary interpretation of the text, today (see Kermani 1996: 5). 34. At least in his time as Chief Q?di of Kenya, from 1968-1982. Looking at the different periods of Shaykh "Abdallah Salih al-Farsfs life, it is possible to say that he was probably not so radical while in Kenya (1968-1982) and not so moderate while in Zanzibar (until 1967) as is often maintained by both his friends and opponents. Thus, he already led a campaign against 'unislamic innovations' such as the dhikr of the Q?diriyya while in Zanzibar, and continued nevertheless to attend official mawlid-cel ebrations while in Kenya. For Shaykh al-FarsT's biography see Musa 1986. For an excel lent analysis of a Wahh?bi movement of reform in a local context, Ivory Coast, see Miran (1998). 35. On this debate, i.e. the anthropomorphic nature of God and the problems of</page><page sequence="21">Translating the Qufan in Sub-Saharan Africa 423 literal/allegoric translation see Seesemann's work on Wadai (Chad). His work shows that theological debates of the Muctazih~ period, i.e. the 9th century, are still 'present' as an issue of public dispute and theological argumentation, even in seemingly periph erical areas such as Wadai in the 20th century. 36. A similar observation may be made with respect to the tafsir of Abubakar Gumi (Gumi 1978) in Northern Nigeria. He translates s?ra 7:54 as: Lalle ne Ubagajinku Allah ne, wanda y a halitta sammai da kasa a cikin kwanaki shida, sa'annan kuma y a daidaita a kan aParshi. The key word, here, is the verb 'daidaita', which means in Hausa, 'to arrange symmetrically', 'to adapt to', or 'to bring into line', as in 'ya daidaita masar da sauran kasashan dunya' (he brought Egypt into line with other countries). Gumi seemingly sticks, thus, to the allegoric interpretation of the verse, even if he never stressed or clarified that issue. In any case, he did not insist on a literal translation, although he had undoubtedly been Saudi Arabia's closest ally in Nigeria, and even was a found ing member of the R?bitat al-c?lam al-Isl?rm. A number of his students and followers have adopted a much clearer position with respect to these problematic verses by stick ing to literal (anthropomorphic) interpretations (see Loimeier 1997; also communications with Andrea Brigaglia 28.2.2005 and Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, 16.6.2005). 37. As in Nasr Hamid Abu Zaid's text 'Naqd al-khit?b ad-dTm', Cairo, 1994. 38. Communication Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, 16.6.2005. See also Kermani 1996 and his discussion of Nasr Hamid Ab? Zaid's position on this issue.</page></plain_text>
