Pr?face de M. Emile Boutroux de lTnstitut. Paris : F?lix Alcan, ?diteur. 1904. Two royal ladies of good education played an important part in the life of Descartes. In the year 1862 Count Foucher de Careil published an ?dition de luxe, under the title Descartes et la Princesse Palatine, o? de ?in?uence du cart?sianisme sur les femmes au dix-septi?me si?cle. The correspondence of Elisabeth was discovered in 1879 at Arnheim and appeared under the title Descartes, la Princesse Palatine et la Reine Christine. The present author has utilised these works and has rummaged the libraries and archives of France and Germany to fill out all their gaps, and with the assistance of Messrs. Boutroux and Darboux, he publishes the present collection of the literary correspondence of these two princesses with the great philosopher. The book affords a real insight into the influence of two noble women upon a great man and is as such a contribution not only to the history of philoso phy but as it were of the civilisatory influences which are at work in shaping our great men. Descartes's correspondence acquires an additional interest through the dreadful fate of Elizabeth, the wife of the Prince-Elector of Palatine, who was elected king of Bohemia and lost crown and throne in</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS. the battle of the White Mountain near Prague. It was the first stroke of the Catholic powers in Germany to reassert themselves and set a limit to the expanse of the Reformation which ushered in the Thirty Years War so disas trous to Germany. The fate of Christine was happier. She was certainly the equal of Elizabeth in intellectual accomplishments. The book is well written, contains good portraits of Descartes, Elizabeth, and Christine, and also a facsimile autograph of Elizabeth, and a reproduction of an old en graving of the city of Herford.
