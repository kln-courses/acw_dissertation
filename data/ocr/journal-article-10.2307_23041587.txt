<plain_text><page sequence="1">Laughing with Medusa: Classical Myth in Feminist Thought. VANDA ZAJKO and MIRIAM LEONARD (Eds.). Oxford University Press, 2006. Pp. xiv + 445 + 10 illustrations. Price: £58.00. ISBN-10: 0-19-927438-x, ISBN-13: 978-0-19-927438-3. This collection of articles draws its title from Helene Cixous' essay 'The Laugh of the Medusa'. Cixous turned to ancient myth in her critique of patriarchy and contemplation of an imaginary space ('the way things could have been', p. 3), and identified especially with Achilles. The editors of this</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 109 volume, Vanda Zajko (Z.) and Miriam Leonard (L.), acknowledge their disagreement over Cixous' affinity with Homer's 'psychopathic' (p. 4) hero. Their disagreement is of the richly productive sort, and the volume may be read as one strategy by which the editors negotiate their differences over Cixous' choice of a hero/totem; in turn, their particular struggle can be read as representing larger struggles among feminists concerning the best ways to use the Greco-Roman heritage to combat (rather than to confirm, as often) the hierarchies of patriarchal society. The goal of the collection is to 'explore how classical myth has been central to the development of feminist thought', not (as the editors emphasize) to focus on any feminist interpretation of specific myths. M. and L. are also concerned with evaluating feminism as a critical tool used to interrogate how various disciplines have appropriated classical myth. Psychoanalysis, for instance, has used myths to encode sexual difference, but feminists have reclaimed and reread ancient narratives to invert such difference. That this rereading has occurred selectively or has denied the positive potential of some myths is a casualty of a process that the volume attempts to correct without denying that such selectivity is to some degree inevitable. The text is divided into five sections, each of which positions feminist responses to myth in relation to a specific discourse, or logos-. psychoanalysis, politics, history, science, and poetry, though the divisions are (perhaps appropriately) less precise than such rubrics indicate. Rachel Bowlby, Vanda Zajko, and Griselda Pollock comment on the ways in which feminism has questioned the explanatory role that psychoanalysis has attributed to classical myth. Bowlby discusses the distinction that psychoanalysis draws between girls and boys in their orientations toward the future (boys are threatened with castration, girls hope to be boys). She reviews Freud's thinking on separation and sexual development, and, in particular, on how lack and longing thwart the development of Freud's female subjects. B. also uncovers inconsistent treatment of the Cronus myth in Freud's theory of castration, and re interprets castration fear as the threat (felt especially by female subjects) of being denied outlets for personal development. Z. probes the nuances of that relationship formed between readers and literary characters ('identification'), and asks how John Keats, Elizabeth Cook, and Cixous all relate to the figure of Achilles. Z. answers criticism of Cixous' identification with the aristocratic, male Achilles by emphasizing that, for the theorist, the revision of ancient narratives not only weakens their conceptual force, but also transforms historical knowledge (p. 59). Z. also uses Melanie Klein's theories of infantile development as determined largely through object relations (introjection and projection) to confirm how our responses to texts shape human subjectivity. The most densely psychoanalytic piece in the collection is that contributed by Pollock, who begins by exploring Virginia Woolf s reaction to classicist Jane Harrison. Harrison's interest in a feminine principle, active in certain ritual contexts, makes her a suitable icon for Woolf, who imagines her as specter leaping across the masculine enclaves of Cambridge. Commentary of this sort serves as a prelude to P.'s discussion of Ettinger's matrixial</page><page sequence="3">110 Reviews feminine and its relevance to Sophocles' Antigone. Ettinger's work sheds light on the nature of the trauma that Antigone suffers, one of 'tearing away into total separateness' (p. 95). The heroine's relationship with her brother Polyneices connotes a dimension of human subjectivity, the matrixial feminine, that is shaped through encounter, rather than through 'the economy of loss and absence' (p. 96). Ettinger locates the origins of this connected aspect of subjectivity in pre-natal experience, where mother and developing child co-exist. Sophocles' play dramatizes how this co-subjectivity prompts the 'activation of a shared humanity that cannot survive if the other's is abused' (p. 104). Miriam Leonard, Simon Goldhill, and Katie Fleming, maintaining a focus on Antigone, emphasize the political implications of feminism's recuperation of myth. Leonard, drawing especially on the work of Nicole Loraux and Luce Irigaray, challenges Lacan's attempts to remove Antigone from (traditionally Hegelian) political debates and to assign her a role representing the ethics of'pure desire' (pur desir). L. demonstrates that Lacan has insinuated the very impurity associated with incest into his analysis of Jocasta. Thus he has not only overlooked an element of the play that insists on Jocasta's ignorance of her actions, but also replayed the familiar dichotomy between virgin (Antigone) and whore (Jocasta), 'the most classic economy of misogyny' (p. 132). Goldhill turns his attention to Ismene and asks why her silencing is 'itself a revealing and worrying political gesture' (p. 145). He reviews ties of kinship between Antigone and Ismene in the light of a Greek literary tradition that placed emphasis on fraternal ties, to the exclusion of sisterhood, until the fifth century (cf. Aeschylus' Choephoroi, Sophocles' Electro). Antigone's relationship to Ismene is radically transformed within the play ('from intense recognition to no recognition at all', p. 158) in a way that may reveal the logic behind Antigone's notorious defence of her decision to bury her brother (Ant. 905-15): the very opacity of these lines prompts the question of just which kinship ties are important. The last article in this section, the least obviously connected with the imperatives of feminism, is Fleming's study of Jean Anouilh's Antigone. Her review of Anouilh's play and its receptions among French Occupation and Resistance forces ultimately leaves the playwright's Nazi sympathies undecided (though F. cites evidence of his anti-Semitic views, p. 181). F. reminds us that Antigone, in whatever form, will always be impressed with the readings she has historically sustained (cf. Martindale 1993). Thus Anouilh's Antigone (however sinister or benign) has imposed an indelible layer upon the contemporary heroine. Ellen O'Gorman's article is the first of two in the volume that discuss feminism's interest in the slippery binarism of myth and history. In considering Helen's causal role in the Trojan War, O. explains her practice of feminist historiography, a field that counteracts patriarchal discourse '...by configuring the project of writing women back into history as a transformation not only of women, but also of history' (p. 193). O. proposes ways of representing women's roles in warfare (e.g., debate and lamentation) that provide alternatives to traditional historical analysis. The author's efforts</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 111 to correct our understanding of history through discussion of a poetic construct may provoke scepticism. But O. adeptly uncovers various aspects of Helen's depiction that reflect an ancient awareness that women, whether named as 'reviled cause of war' or 'sanctified object of military protection' (p. 207), are only a pretext for the wars men fight. Staley comments on the relationship that feminism has had with America in its guise as the New World. Cixous' (originally Freudian) idea of the 'dark continent' provides a starting point for S., who uses it to emphasize the liberating potential of unknown lands. Cixous' model of woman's self exploration depends on the role that America played for Renaissance Europe: the New World '...offered a model for how those on antiquity's margins could critique the center' (p. 214). S. marshals a wide range of evidence — from the founding fathers' rejection of aristocratically fused Greco-Roman mythology to the appropriation of Amazon myths by American suffragettes - to demonstrate how the New World consciously occupied the perspective of the Other as it explored ancient mythology for its own identity. Part four deals with feminism's role in reshaping narratives of scientific discovery. Duncan Kennedy cites feminist critiques that have exposed gendered language within a field of inquiry that claims to offer universal truths. The proponents of reductionism (a term loosely identified with 'scientific method') have answered such criticism by arguing that it is possible to use ungendered scientific discourse in the search for fundamental causes. K. asks to what extent reductionists can escape the historical legacy handed down from the Epicurean poet Lucretius, whose atoms are highly anthropomorphic bodies (corpora) that are always at war or striking oaths, activities we should recognize as highly masculine. K. finds similar anthropomorphizing tendencies in Lucretius' successors who have made reductionist claims (e.g., R. Dawkins, The Selfish Gene), and stresses that 'anthropomorphism...is always going to be a feature of our descriptions of things whenever agency is attributed to them' (p. 252). Alison Sharrock's article continues interrogating the myths that govern scientific truths, but focuses more intensely on Lucretius. S. identifies those mythical (feminine) elements of De rerum natura that counter the logic of the more scientific (masculine) elements (an effort akin to Patin's anti-Lucrece chez Lucrece, as the author acknowledges, p. 258). S. stresses how the 'female and the metaphorical sit happily together' (p. 261) in Lucretius and allow the poet to represent certain elements (e.g., nature, earth, etc.) as feminine deities. The bereaved mother cow in DRN reminds us of the difficulties facing a reader who, after being told not to fear suffering in death, cannot avoid the suffering that loss brings. If Kennedy and Sharrock accept (while not endorsing) the binary oppositions that shape Lucretius' poem and succeeding scientific narratives, Genevieve Liveley scrutinizes a figure thought to destabilize such oppositions, the cyborg. L.'s discussion centers on the work of Donna Haraway, whose essay, 'A Cyborg Manifesto' (1991), proposed the part-human, part-machine cyborg as a metaphor for human subjectivity in the twentieth century; within this creature 'category distinctions are collapsed...as the possible conditions for any mode of unified subjectivity are denied' (p. 281). L. reveals a</page><page sequence="5">112 Reviews teleology of feminism implicit in the cyborg myth that denigrates other forms of feminism, e.g., second wave and ecofeminism. L. also makes a distinction between the cyborg and the composite figures of antiquity identified as its ancestor: myths of Amazons and Centaurs functioned largely to confirm the identity of the Greek male. Haraway's cyborg, in contrast, '...denies us and our post-human selves the conditions of a unified subjectivity' (p. 293). The contributions of the final section of the volume explore women's appropriation of myth in their creative efforts. Lilian Doherty suggests that such efforts, described here as 'women's traditions' (cf. old wives' tales) might be inferred through a careful reading of the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women. D. criticizes the male biased textual tradition that has handled the Catalogue-. editors have explained it as a genealogy of heroes, rather than being 'about' women, despite traces of female focalization. The author finds comparative evidence for women's traditions in the Odyssey (e.g., the catalogue of women in the underworld, 11.235-332), and surveys the Catalogue itself for signs that a tale might have had particular resonance for a female audience (e.g., wish fulfillment, lack of blame for sexual misconduct). Penelope Murray's article probes the relationship between women and artistic creation through an examination of the Muses, and their later incarnations, especially in the 18th c. English intellectual landscape. Her aim is to consider positive implications of the Muses' gender in ancient texts and '...to highlight some moments in the history of reception when Muse imagery has been used as a means of empowering women rather than oppressing them' (p. 330). The article offers a refreshing alternative to classical scholarship that has focused on the Muses as passive enablers of male creativity. M.'s ancient examples, drawn from Homer, Sappho, and Euripides (among others), challenge the notion that men had exclusive access to the Muses' inspiration. Efi Spentzou is similarly interested in how female poets make use of the icons of antiquity, but takes an approach more sensitive to nationality: 'the stories woven around Helen of Troy. ..represent a microcosm of the troubled and inspired itinerary of classical myth in the cultural mosaic of modern Greece' (p. 356). S. credits Helen's recent transformation in Greek literature to social upheaval, especially the Colonels' dictatorship (1967-74) and the feminist movements of the mid to late 20th century. During the Colonels' regime, political exile Yannis Ritsos created an 'immortal but ageing diva' (p. 368), who dispels the myths of an idealized Greek past. S. also assembles an anthology of Greek women poets (1960s-1980s), whose verses she intends for us to read with Ritsos' Helen in mind. This composite Helen is more comfortable with the minutiae of private life, and less oppressed by the weight of tradition. Rowena Fowler examines responses to the story of Daphne and Apollo, particularly those of poets Jorie Graham and Eavan Boland, and explains the myth's vitality as 'providing] an insight into women's experiences as subjects and makers of poems' (p. 381). Daphne's physical transformation makes her an ideal figure through which women can reflect on the physical changes that mark their lives. Her relationship to poetry is more problematic ('Apollo gets poetry; Daphne becomes poetry'), yet she is saved from becoming another</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 113 version of the passive Muse because her silence 'provides a cue for women poets interested in finding images for the ways language might be renewed by being stalled, or stripped to its essences' (p. 391). At this point the reader, having considered various critical responses to women's poetic recuperation of myth, is prepared to make her own response to Cook's short story, 'Iphigeneia's Wedding', which revives the tale of Iphigenia and concludes the volume, leaving both the heroine's tale and the tale of feminism's relationship to the classics tantalizingly open ended. Iphigenia's wedding, of course, never arrives, though classicists know well how this western master narrative is played out. Or do we? Revising master narratives is as old as antiquity itself — one of the virtues of this collection is that it makes us more aware of the political capital invested in each revision. It is all too easy in reviews of this sort to over-simplify individual contributions. Readers with little experience of feminist textual criticism (especially of the French psychoanalytic sort) will usually find basic premises explained before they are challenged or defended. A certain degree of thematic continuity (e.g., Antigone in the first two sections of the book) also offers welcome, familiar territory to any classicist grappling with new ideas; there is among the contributions a real sense of dialogue and collaboration. Finally, it is worth stating an important (if a bit obvious) by-product of this endeavor: namely, that, in addition to tracing the impact of classical myth on feminist thought, the volume exposes the sorts of things that feminism has done for classics. The discipline can only benefit from critical tools that prompt us to revise our assumptions about ancient societies and the mythological structures so central to their understanding of the world.
