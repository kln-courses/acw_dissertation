Walter HÃ¶lbling With this volume of 22 critical essays, the editors present the harvest of a conference held at Mainz University, Germany, in 1996 - the third in a series of meetings Hoffmann and Hornung organized on postmodern issues. In their preface, the editors emphasize the interdisciplinarity of approaches collected here, and a multitude of disciplines is, indeed, the quality that recommends this anthology of criticism to the interested reader, as it covers the fields of architecture, literature, history, philosophy, sociology, technology, the media, music, drama, and dance. Their common point of reference is - in some of them rather obliquely, though - the (non-) representation of emotion in postmodern productions, from skyscrapers and landscape presentation to (popular) fiction, pop music and talk shows, literary/cultural criticism and philosophy. Given the elusiveness of the subject as well as the range and diversity of ap- proaches, the editors present us with a discordia concors connoisseurs of postmodern texts will highly appreciate, as they can actively engage themselves in the business of establishing connections among and between the multi-coded signifiers of individual contributions. Following the path suggested by the arranged sequence of articles will be the approach of the following comments, but it is certainly not the only possible one. On a different level, to voice some general critique right away, the book also comes across as a representative product of postmodern book- publishing: few (academic) publishing companies today indulge in the luxury of having competent in-house editors and prefer to 'publish' (or rather, simply print) their titles off ready-for-print floppy disks provided by the authors/editors/contributors, who also carry the burden of overall editorial responsibility - from proofreading to stylistic editing, etc. Several of the essays in this volume would have benefitted from a stronger editorial hand that might have cut out rambling asides, tightened and/or supplemented some lines of argument, rounded some stylistic hard edges, and taken care of an irritatingly large number of typing errors and misplaced commas. Such an editor might also have objected to publishing a volume like this without any biographi- cal notes about the 22 contributors.... The books starts out with Linda Nicholson's essay "Emotion in Postmodern Public Spaces," with a focus on the "therapeutic turn" of (publicly) dealing with emotions and feelings and on the importance "feelings" have gained in politics in the U.S. and other industrialized societies ("identity politics", "coalition politics"). Nicholson convincingly argues that the impact of Freudian ideas, postulating a general balance within the individual between socially given ends and individual libidinal drives, was instrumental for this development, which contributed towards making U. S. culture more democratic by extending the range of claims that could be made on body politics. The following contribution, Hans Bertens' "Why Molly Doesn't: Humanism's Long, Long Shadow", provides a counterpoint to Nicholson in so far as it contrasts the publicly emotional and visual quotidian postmodern culture with highly discursive and rather non-emotional postmodern literature (Pynchon) and sees this discrepancy as an example of a classic generation gap: many postmodern</page><page sequence="2">Rezensionen 1 49 writers and critics grew up in the 1940s and 1950s, considered the cleverly designed public displays of emotions since the late '60s as inauthentic and demeaning, and reacted to them in their works by means of irony and other (modernist) distancing techniques. Bertens' argument, if at times a bit elliptical, is quite stringent and also implies that it may be time for a general re-vision of traditional concepts of 'modern- ism' and 'postmodernism'. Focusing on what is aptly called "the commodified celebra- tion of difference" in everyday postmodern culture, Chris Weedon's "Race, Gender, Emotion and the Construction of Otherness" takes a close look at the cyberspace- linked "lonely hearts"-sections of selected British newspapers and points to the ambivalent (ab)use of some aspects of "identity politics": rather than identifying difference it may construct it, perpetuating traditional racist, gender and class stereo- types, as is amply demonstrated here by the wording of samples from the newspaper columns. The fact that face-to-face-communication in postmodern societies has been increasingly replaced by communication through media on the one hand guarantees control over one's emotions and fantasies, yet, on the other, instead of facilitating an encounter with, and a possible understanding of, the 'Other', also makes it easy to be content with the mediated simulacrum and to avoid any serious involvement with a real person. As informative as it is entertaining, Johann N. Schmidt's contribution on "Archi- tecture as Joyride: Postmodern Skyscrapers" compares the essentialist principles of modernist architecture (implying a universally applicable "master narrative") with the eclectic varieties of postmodern styles and discusses the emotions the finished buildings - traditional icons of America's advance in technology - produce in the viewer. Schmidt makes us aware of a number of paradoxical similarities between the two supposedly different appeals of architecture, e.g. the 'postmodern' emotional appeal of Mies van der Rohe's modernist Seagram Building; he also notes that the individual and idiosyncratic effects of postmodern architecture - conceived as a departure from the "dehumanized uniformity" of modernism - in fact depend more than ever before on impersonal modeling procedures (of computer-aided design); likewise, what looks like the result of old handicraft is only made possible by means of advanced techniques of standardization. Using a more natural example of American greatness, David Nye's "De-Realizing the Grand Canyon" investigates the intriguing interrelations of medialized reality, mass society and emotional identification and, among other things, also presents a somewhat disturbing paradigm of media power: Nye shows how, thanks to the popular stereographs of the late 19fh century, the Grand Canyon, discovered only in 1869 and visited by few before 1900, had become a national icon by the turn of the century - like Niagara, Yosemite, or Yellowstone one of the sites to contemplate and experience the natural sublime. Paradoxically, contemporary mass mobility/tourism has led to similar results: only a fraction of the visitors are able to personally experi- ence more than a glimpse of the greatness of the canyon; for most, the postmodern Grand Canyon has become a collage of representations in different media, from educational slide shows and books to audiovisually and emotionally quite appealing IMAX film shows and, soon to come, the Virtual Canyon in cyberspace. "Prosthetic Emotions" (by Kathleen Woodward) is the title of the following essay, and it leads the reader from emotions created by machines to emotions created in and for machines, as illustrated by a discussion of Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey</page><page sequence="3">1 50 Rezensionen trilogy that spans a period of sixty years and traces the emotional evolution of its two main characters, a human male and a computer. In the end, the two are virtually indistinguishable from each other, in a vision of 'technobioevolution' (N. K. Hayes), which Woodward sees as part of our "technological socialization", i.e. the attribution of (anthropomorphic) emotions to computers and their extensions. Somewhat elliptically, the conclusion of the paper suggests that this investment of emotions in an object may cause a psychopathological state in which the self conceives of itself as a material object; a more elaborate argument of this aspect and its emotional results might also have included a discussion of whether there is a categorical difference between the traditional human tendency to anthropomorphize everything (from mountains to plants, pets and machines) and the humanizing view of comput- ers, or whether this is just a well-known human habit extended to a new technology. Sally Banes' contribution "Postmodernism, the Emotions and the Dancing Body" brings us back to earth and discusses the impact choreographers of analytic postmodern dance have had since the late '60s, especially with their refusal of the traditional modernist ideas of strong emotions (like love, passion, despair) being best expressed by dancing (female) bodies. Banes makes us aware that these innovations not only changed the terms of dance theory but also influenced the feminist debate about women's bodies and women's art, challenging the traditional link between mind-intellect-male and body-emotion-female. The next essay also takes us onto the stage, this time to the theater and to John Barth's notorious funhouse of Ocean City; in addition, Jochen Achilles' "In and Out of the Funhouse: Emotion in Postmodernism and Postcolonial Drama" turns out to be an impressive performance of enlightened and enlightening criticism in its own right. Achilles chooses Barth's short story as an example for the early, self-referential phase of postmodernism, and August Wilson's The Piano Lesson (1987) and the South African Athol Fugard's Play land (1 992) as examples for its current post-colonial phase. The choice is, as it turns out, inspired by a common cluster of themes that tie strong (sexual) emotions to racism and violence - a connection not immediately visible in Barth's text but quite convincingly demonstrated by Achilles, whose discussion of the three texts proves that postmodernism has developed from a movement preoccupied with epistemologi- ca! issues to a movement concerned with the specifics of emotionally important demarcations. Without emotional substance, the formal intricacies of self-reflection are in danger of becoming narcissistic. "Feel the Noise: Excess, Affect and the Acoustic", by Steven Connor, is one of two contributions that deal with postmodern sound/noise and emotion. At times rambling, at times elliptical in his argument, Connor nevertheless aptly makes his point that in post-literate societies maybe "emotion in contemporary life has flowed into the acoustic" and diagnoses a "generalised acoustaesthesia, or sonorisation of affect" in which "the ear becomes associated with the pulsions of the lived (as op- posed to the observed, or merely represented) body", which is the domain of the visual and analytical, the eye. Emphasizing that emotion is itself a mode of attention and a way of making the world intelligible, the author suggests that it should be given equal status with the eye's cognitive activities in their common search for making sense of the world. On a different note, Richard Martin's "'Why should I not admit it?': Displays of Emotion in Postmodern Popular Music" explores the supposed absence of emotions in contemporary pop music; he diagnoses the contrary and</page><page sequence="4">Rezensionen 151 furnishes strong evidence for the emotion of love as well as the emotion of deprivai, though at times in the guise of irony and parody, on the textual as well as on the musical level. His findings also support H. Bertens' thesis of the 'generation gap' between emotional public and reserved literary/critical discourse. In view of its encyclopedic and systematic approach one would perhaps have wished that the centerpiece of this collection, Gerhard Hoffmann's almost 50pp. essay on "Emotion and Desire in the Postmodern American Novel" had been more 'de-centered' and moved to the beginning of the book. It is, in spite of its limiting title, the most comprehensive attempt in this volume to contextualize diverse historical definitions of 'emotion', 'feeling', and 'desire' and their (inter-)active functions in the production processes of art in general and postmodern literature in particular. Hoffmann also provides the reader with some criteria towards a definition of 'postmodernism' - something most other contributors do not bother with but rather take their personal idea of 'postmodern' as a (mostly implicit) base for their discus- sions. Hoffman discusses various direct and indirect manifestations of emotion and desire in major postmodern texts and argues persuasively that they are also the central values in all postmodern fiction. In his concluding comparison of modern and postmodern modes, exemplified by Faulkner's Absalom! Absalom! and Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49, he suggests that one of the major differences is that the postmodern lacks a collective and personal frame of history and culture that might provide a sense of directionality and wholeness for Oedipa Maas' emotional, existen- tial, and cognitive balancing act between paranoia and contingency. His diagnosis also seems to imply (though H. does not say so) that, however comfortable a sense of wholeness and closure may be for our (emotional) directionality, it may turn counterproductive if we make it an absolute sine qua non: after all, Pynchon's hero- ine, at the end of the novel, continues with her quest, whereas Quentin Compson commits suicide. Taking issue with Fredric Jameson's dicta of postmodernism's "waning of effect", its "hysterical sublime" and "depthless historicism", Theo D'haen in "Salman Rushdie's The Moore's Last Sigh , or, The Emotional Depth of Postmodernism" criticizes Jameson's idea of "central postmodernism" and presents Rushdie's novel as example for what he calls "counter-postmodernism". In his analysis of the novel, D'haen illustrates how Rushdie's elaborate intertextuality does not lead his protago- nist into the "depthlessness of historicism" but rather back into historicity. The follow- ing essay by Heinz-GÃ¼nter Vester, "Postmodern Emotions: Ein weites Fe/Ä, may have intended to do for GÃ¼nter Grass' novel and the historical event of German reunification what D'haen does for Rushdie's book and the history of the Moors; unfortunately, the piece carries a rather truncated line of argument and reads more like a shortened and simplified statement of theses about postmodernism. The fact that neither footnotes nor bibliography are included does not help much either. RÃ¼diger Kunow's "'Emotion Recollected in Tranquillity'? Representing the Holocaust in Fiction" approaches its delicate subject with great sensitivity and a highly perceptive and differentiating line of argument. While granting that the Wordsworthian dictum in its original meaning cannot be applied to that subject, he quotes Wittgenstein's "What we cannot speak about we must consign to silence" and reminds us that the silencing of all things Jewish was exactly the practice of the perpetrators of the Holocaust. Kunow then goes on to illustrate how second-genera-</page><page sequence="5">1 52 Rezensionen tion authors have moved "from the mimesis to the poesis of the Holocaust" and confronted the Holocaust by using radical aesthetic strategies of what Aharon Appelfeld called enabling obliqueness - displacement, self-conscious limitation of referentiality, dislocation of subjectivity, and the disfiguration of horror through the comic and the grotesque - and thus found a way of being able to "speak for some- thing ... even if it can be located only by carving out a void within what is being said". Dealing not with historical but with contemporary traumata, Hanjo Berressem in "Emotions Flattened and Scattered: 'Borderline Syndromes' and 'Multiple Personality Disorders' in Contemporary Fiction" analyzes two forms of contemporary psychopa- thology and their presentation in postmodern, neo-realistic crime novels and cyberfictions. In a multi-media world of "pure surfaces and mirrors" the borders between reality and simulacrum have begun to disappear, violence is rampant, emotions have evaporated, and cyberspace offers a puzzling world of time-space- simultaneity that merely simulates the boundaries of virtual, perceptual bodies - all of which contributes to a loss/dissemination of the individual's sense of a coherent self. Providing ample (and very helpful) references from current research in psychol- ogy and sociology, the author identifies many of the hero-villains of neo-realistic crime novels as clear cases of borderline syndrome and goes on to discuss Pat Cadigan's cyberpunk novel Fools as an example of multiple personality disorder. Alfred Hornung takes on a different realm of texts in 'The Witchcraft of Fiction/The Fiction of Witchcraft", establishing affinities between the "emotion-based storytelling, or lying, the witchcraft of fiction" of the Salem Witchcraft Trials, Nathaniel Hawthorne's "fiction of witchcraft" for emancipatory purposes in The Scarlet Letter, and Stephen King's and Anne Rice's popular romances. The well-argued, though not totally unexpected conclusion is that while Hawthorne's writing produces an emo- tional effect in the recipient with a potential for catharsis and enlightenment, King and Rice rather practice the original Salem "witchcraft of fiction", in which not the victims but the bewitching of the audience and the spectacle are most important. Developing a theme resonant in some of the preceding contributions, Herbert Grabes in "Aesthetic Emotion" more extensively discusses concepts of "aesthetic emotion" and the "sublime" from Burke to Cassirer and Kristeva and then looks at a variety of postmodern texts. He finds a widespread and often ironical distancing of/from emotions in most of them, except in the texts of ethnic writers, and suggests that the term "aesthetics of the strange" might be more suitable to characterize their emotional quality than that of the sublime. "Emotions in Reading Postmodernism", Evelyne Keitel's essay, takes a closer look at the pleasures of reading and distin- guishes between a set of emotions which originates in the cognitive act of sense- making, and one that goes together with the unconscious assimilation of the text; their interactions are necessary for a comprehensive reading. Interesting as the approach is, the argument turns out to be somewhat inconclusive, partly because of a confusing mixture of nomenclature from Freud to Lacan, partly because of puzzling statements like: 'The two levels of reading are markedly distinct. They do not run parallel. And yet they interact." It might have been easier to follow the reasoning if the author had provided at least one exemplary application of her thesis. A detailed investigation into the nature and varieties of emotions and their relation to affects and feelings as well as to values is the concern of Joel J. Kupperman's contribution 'The Disunity of Emotion". Being a systematic account of one of the</page><page sequence="6">Rezensionen 1 53 central themes of this volume, it might as well have been placed among the first couple of essays, as it also discusses the relations of emotion with central postmodern phenomena, like lack of unity, juxtapositions of different frames, etc., though these relations are not established until the very end of the essay. NoÃ«l Carroll, in "Simulation, Emotions and Morality", starts out with an extensive discus- sion of simulation theory and its possible applications to the act of reading (insofar as we become engaged emotionally with fictions by simulating the emotional states of characters), only to dismiss this theory after eight pages in favor of an assimilation theory derived from R. Wollheim, R. Gerrig and D. Prentice, which considers the reader an outside observer rather than a simulator. The morality aspect receives short shrift in this argument, and one comes away with the impression that this article might better have been placed in a volume on the psychology of narratology. What one might consider another displaced text follows next, Edith Wyschogrod's "Fear of Primitives, Primitive Fears: Anthropology in the Philosophies of Heidegger and LÃ©vinas". The author presents a highly spirited discussion of the function of the primitive in the ideas of these two philosophers, but unless we equate primitive with emotion and recent existentialist philosophy with postmodernism, there is no discern- ible thematic connection to the topic of this volume. The concluding essay by Lothar Bredella, "Involvement and Detachment: How to Read and Teach Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman WarrioÅ¥ , discusses postmodern and sociological readings of this novel and stresses the necessity of being able to identify with characters in reading, rather than, as postmodern episte- mologica! skepticism tends to do, exclude the other as unknowable - an aspect that reminds the reader of Chris Weedon's statement about the construction and ambiva- lent use of ethnic otherness/identity. Bredella's suggestion that one should see cognitive and emotional responses in the act of reading not as binary oppositions but rather as complementary and interac- tive processes also sounds a note many of the articles in this volume have in com- mon. At a time when psychologists have (re)discovered the EQ as necessary com- plement of the IQ, this critical anthology pays tribute to the often widely neglected emotional aspects of postmodernism and reminds us that emotions - no matter how much they may be commodified, branded with irony, repressed, negated, depersonal- ized, or abstracted by contemporary media - remain necessary constituent elements in the production and reception of art(efacts).
