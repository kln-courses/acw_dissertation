<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OLDEST MIDRASH: PRE-RABBINIC IDEALS AND TEACHINGS IN THE PASSOVER HAGGADAH LOUIS FINKELSTEIN JEWISH THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY, NEW YORK THE researches of the last three decades have conclusively shown that toward the end of the third century B.C. a profound change occurred in the spiritual life of the Jews. Literary proph- ecy, which had been declining since the time of Haggai and Zechariah (ca. 518 B.C.), now definitely came to an end. The noble tradition had been in its death throes for no less than three centuries. In vain did the Joels, the Obadiahs, and the Deutero-Zechariahs seek to save it from complete eclipse. Its hour had passed. In the meantime, new forces were arising to contend for its place in the spiritual leadership of Israel. A group of poets, who sought to exert an influence through the liturgy and the Temple ritual, composed and collected the larger part of the Psalter. Writers of wisdom literature, influ- enced in part by Egyptian examples, created the Books of Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, and Ecclesiasticus. Prose writers and novelists undertook to mould the Jewish mind by re-writing the history of the people, and produced the Books of Chronicles, Jonah, Ruth, and Esther, as well as the apochryphal Judith and Tobit. There were individuals, here and there, who combined in themselves various talents and associations, producing Wis- dom Psalms, such as Psalms 37, 73, and 139, as well as Lamen- tations 3; there was one, at least, who attempted to create a direct link between prophecy and psalm-writing, by composing Habukkuk, chapter 3. One gifted novelist, apparently belong- ing to the class which produced the Books of Jonah and Ruth, transformed the Book of Job from a theological disputation into a religious romance. In the midst of this struggle for the succession to prophecy we can dimly discern the beginnings of the movement which was actually to supplant the prophetic tradition; the tradition of the Scribes. Refusing to avow themselves the mouthpieces of God, the Scribes achieved even greater influence than had come to Isaiah and Jeremiah, by demanding recognition as</page><page sequence="2">292 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW exponents of the Law. For a time, as is clear from Psalm 119, they were persecuted; 1 and for a much longer period, they were unrecognized. Nevertheless, they slowly won a large following among the people, and toward the end of the third century B.C., were apparently strong enough to challenge the supremacy of the High Priesthood itself in the spiritual leadership of Judea. The final scene which marked the end of Prophecy and the definitive recognition of the Scribes or Scholars, was, doubtless, the Great Assembly, which was convoked by Simeon II, the Righteous, who was High Priest, toward the end of the third century B.C.2 The confusion which filled the minds of historians regarding the Great Assembly has at last been dissipated through the work of careful and diligent students.3 We now can say with assurance that there actually was such a meeting; that it consisted of the High Priest, other priests, Levites, and lay scholars; and that its epochal importance lay in the fact that for the first time in the history of the Second Commonwealth, these groups deliberated together.4 Among the achievements of the Great Assembly were prob- ably the formulation of daily prayer-services for the Temple and for the synagogues; the establishment of a fixed form for the Grace after Meat; the final closing of the Prophetic Canon; and the transformation of the oligarchic gerousia into a Sanhedrin, in which the lay plebeian scholars sat with the representatives of the priests and other patricians.5 The Scribes were distinguished from all the other groups who 1 See Ps. 119. 161. 2 Concerning the identity of Simeon the Righteous, see the convincing article of G.

They were Scribes only insofar as they wrote copies of the Law; they did not in the main compose new works. The material which they gathered and composed is incorporated in the Talmudic tradi- tion, and is almost entirely anonymous. As a result, it has thus far proven quite impossible to separate their early teachings from those of their followers; and we can rarely say with cer- tainty whether a particular norm arose in the second or third century B.C. or in the first or second century of our era. It is this fact which, primarily, accounts for the difficulty in con- structing a history of Jewish law and theology, during the Second Commonwealth. Only within the last century have there been made fully ac- cessible works like the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Book of Jubilees, the Books of Enoch, and the Document of the Sect of Damascus (the so-called Zadokite Document) which give us some definite contemporaneous information re- garding law and theology in the second century B.c. But each of these books comes from circles which represented special interests, and were apparently of limited influence. None of them is written with the responsibility attaching to authors who had any official position in Judaism. It is, therefore, a most fortunate chance which enables us to discover in the well-known service for Passover evening an an- cient Midrash, which can now be dated as belonging to the last half of the third century or the first half of the second century B.c. The fact that this is three hundred years earlier than the date of the compilation of any similar tract so far identified, would itself make this Midrash significant.6 It happens, how- ever, that the contents of the Midrash are of singular impor- tance, from an historical as well as from a theological point of 6 It is probably inaccurate to describe Megillat Ta'anit, which was apparently com- posed during the first century (or at the latest the first half of the second century), as a Midrash. After that work, the oldest compilations are probably those incorporated in our halakic midrashim; concerning which see Ch. Albeck, Untersuchungen ueber die halakischen Midraschim, Berlin, 1927; cf. also my discussion of the Sifre in Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research, 1931-1983, p. 41.</page><page sequence="4">294 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW view. They assume an especial significance, as will be shown, because they emanate from the circles of the highest temple ecclesiastics, probably from the High Priest himself, giving us for the first time definite information regarding the views of these distinguished circles of Jewish thought. The Midrash (hereinafter referred to as M) has been pre- served in all the extant rituals for the Passover evening, as well as in a number of Genizah fragments,7 in practically identical form, so that there can be little question of the original form of the text. In form, it is a running commentary on the following verses from Deuteronomy (26. 5-8), the passage recited by the pilgrims when they brought the first fruits to the Temple: "A wandering Aramaean was my father,8 and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number, and he became there a nation, great, mighty and populous. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us heavy bond- age. And we cried unto the Lord the God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders." The passage was obviously selected as basis for the Midrash, because it was part of the confession recited each year by the pilgrims, and was, therefore, well known by the people. Even people who could not read every part of Scripture with ease could recall this passage; and those who had no books could recite it by heart.' 7 In addition to the fragments used by I. Abrahams, in J. Q. R., X, 1897, pp. 41 ff.; W. Bacher, ibid., pp. 380 ff.; and J. Greenstone in ZfHB, XV, 1911, pp. 12 ff.; I have consulted the following fragments from the Adler collection in the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America: 2840, 2841, 3214, 3222, 3762, and 3775, all of which contain the part of Passover Haggadah including M. 8 IIeb. 'arami 'obed 'abi, which is interpreted by the Midrash as though it read 'arami 'ibed 'abi, "An Aramaean destroyed my father." See below for the discussion of this difference between the received text and the interpretation. 9 See Deut. 26. 5a; Mishna Bikkurim 1. 1. It is interesting to note that the Karaites also recite the biblical passage, Deut. 26. 5-8 in their Passover Haggadah, though they omit the Midrash (see Ha-Haggadah Shel Pesah 'Im Targum 'Arabi Ke-Minhag Ha- Karaim, Pressburg, 1879, p. 3).</page><page sequence="5">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 295 M itself may be translated as follows: I. 1. Go forth and learn. What did Laban the Aramaean intend to do to our father, Jacob? For Pharaoh decreed the destruction only of the males, while Laban sought to destroy the whole family. Thus it is written, The Aramaean sought to destroy my father 10 and he (my father) went down into Egypt and sojourned there, few in number, and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. II. 1. And he went down into Egypt; compelled thereto by the word of God." 2. And sojourned there. This teaches us that he did not go down into Egypt to settle there, but only to sojourn, as it is said, "And they said unto Pharaoh: To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen" (Gen. 47. 4). 3. Few in number, as it is said, "Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude" (Deut. 10. 22). III. 1. And he became there a nation. This teaches us that the Israelites were distinguished there. IV. 1. Great and mighty, as it is said, "And the children of Israel were fruit- ful and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty, and the land was filled with them" (Exod. 1. 7). 10 See note 8. 11 The passage "Compelled thereto by the word of God" is omitted in the version of the Haggadah found in the Code of Maimonides and in the ritual of the Yemenite Jews. It was probably also lacking in the text of the Haggadah used by R. Saadia Gaon (882-94~ of our era) in composing his famous Seder R. Saadia, since he makes no com- ment on it. It is also lacking in the version preserved in the Genizah fragment de- scribed by I. Abrahams, in J. Q. R., X, 1897, p. 50, fragment no. IX; while the Ms. described by him (ibid., p. 45), as well as that described by J. Greenstone in ZfHB, XV, 1911, p. 123, read 'anush instead of 'anus, meaning, "made to suffer through the word of God." Apparently those responsible for this usage had hesitated to delete the ancient passage, and yet felt the need of changing it somewhat so as to reconcile it to their sojourn in Egypt. A similar need apparently led the copyist of Cod. Adler 3992, in the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (or the group which formulated the version it represents), to add an explanation of the words "compelled thereto by the word of God." Unfortunately, the text is so mutilated that the explanation cannot be reconstructed. It is also to be noted that the phrase, "compelled thereto by the word of God," does not occur in the comment of either the Sifre or the Midrash Ha-Gadol on Deut. S6. 5. With regard to the Sifre, it is possible that its compiler rejected the phrase as he rejected other parts of M, which seemed to him unsupported by Scripture (see below, Appendix II). The omission in the Midrash Ha-Gadol, which transcribes all the rest of M, indicates that, as might be expected, it follows the Yemenite ritual of the Haggadah (see Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research, 1931-1932, pp. 20 ff.).</page><page sequence="6">296 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW 2.

Adler 3775, the passage, "This refers to the forcible separation from marital intercourse" is inserted in the comment on the words, "and our toil," instead of on the words, "and our affliction," taking the place of the phrase, "This refers to the children," which is entirely omitted. In Cod. Adler 2841, there is a similar transpo- sition, except that the words, "This refers to the children," are retained so that the passage reads: "And our toil. This refers to the forcible separation from marital inter- course. This refers to the children, as it is said, 'Every son etc.' " I.

Saadia, the Code of Maimonides, and the ritual of the Yemenite Jews. The view that it is to be omitted is also cited in Shibbale Ha-Leket (ed. Buber, 97a). But it is found in all the other rites; I therefore cannot follow E. D. Goldschmidt, Die Pessach-Haggada, Berlin, 1937, p. 54, in rejecting it. It was doubtless omitted by some rabbis because they were offended by the emphatic denial of the angels, which is implied in it. 15 It is clear that it is only the words, "I am the Lord," which justify the special interpretation put upon the biblical passage. In all the other phrases the personal pronoun is in no way emphasized. The commentators on the Haggadah have, of course, noticed this and remark that the compiler projects the emphasis on "I am the Lord," into the other phrases. 1i The compiler obviously read the biblical text ubemar'eh gadol "and with a great Vision," rather than ubemora' gadol "And with great terribleness," as the Massoretic Text has it. For the evidence that the former was the original reading, see notes 38, 39. The fact that the compiler read ubemar'eh gadol was specifically noted by Geiger, Urschrift, pp. 339 ff.; but his view was partially adumbrated by mediaeval writers. Isaac Abravanel in his commentary on the Haggadah, notes that the consonantal text of the biblical verse can still be read ubemar'eh, since it omits the vav which would natu- rally follow the mem, if the correct reading were ubemora'. The remark is repeated by Jacob Emden in his commentary on the Haggadah. Similarly, Mahzor Vitry, ed. Horowitz, p. 993, Siddur Rashi, ed. Buber, p. 193, Orhot Hayyim of R. Aaron Ha- Kohen of Lunel, 83b, and Kol Bo 51, remark that the words ubemora' gadol are taken by the compiler of the Haggadah as the equivalent of ubemar'eh gadol.</page><page sequence="8">298 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs" (Exod. 4. 17). 6. And with wonders. This refers to the blood, as it is said, "And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke" (Joel 3. 3). The numbers prefixed to the sections and the sub-sections have, of course, been added by me; but they reflect, as can be seen from a close examination of the text, a division inherent in M itself. The compiler of M was obviously a systematic thinker who arranged his work according to a clearly recognizable scheme, which can be reduced to the following outline: I. Introduction, denouncing Laban the Aramaean for seeking to destroy Jacob. II. Protest against emigration from Palestine to Egypt.17 III. Exhortation to the Egyptian Jews to retain their ancestral customs. IV. Reflections on the rapid increase of the Israelites in ancient Egypt. V. Citations of parallels to Deut. 26. 6-7, from the relevant verses of Exodus. VI. Denunciation of the Egyptian bondage. VII. Enunciation of four propagandist views, of which two concern theology, and two politics. The transparent lucidity of M is the more remarkable because the Midrashic style necessarily compelled the compiler to ar- range his material with a view to the basic Pentateuchal pas- sages which he had chosen as his text. That in spite of this he succeeded in keeping a systematic order for his ideas, marks him as master of rhetorical form. In the present analysis of M, an effort is made to demonstrate the following propositions: 1. M was composed no later than the Maccabean Age; and probably before that, in the last decades of the third century B.c. 2. It is essentially a propagandist tract, endeavoring to impress the views of its compiler on the many pilgrims who came to Jerusalem for the Passover. 3. Several of the views it inculcates were opposed to those of the great mass of Hasideans and later Pharisees. 17 Section II, 3, offers, as will be shown below, Appendix I, a reassurance to the Egyptian Jews that the discouragement of immigration to their country will not interfere with their numbers, which depend, after all, on the blessing of God and natural increase.</page><page sequence="9">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 299 4. It is the work of a patrician, probably of a High Priest. 5. Several parts of it were addressed to the pilgrims from Egypt, and sought to stem the tide of assimilation in Alexandria and other large Egyptian communities. I. THE DATE OF M The date of M necessarily falls between the fourth century B.C. and the third century of our era. These limits are set by the following considerations: (a) The Midrashic style used by M as well as its diction and its concepts all belong to the Second Commonwealth, and a period later than Ezra. (b) It cites the Book of Chronicles, which was certainly put into its present form no earlier than the fourth century B.C. (c) On the other hand, M is itself cited in the tannaitic Midrashim which were compiled in the third century of our era.18 Once these limits are recognized, the actual date is fixed more narrowly, in my opinion, by the opening words of M: "Go forth and learn. What did Laban the Aramaean intend to do to our father, Jacob? For Pharaoh decreed the destruction only of the males, while Laban sought to destroy the whole family. Thus it is written, The Aramaean sought to destroy my father." It would under any circumstances seem peculiar that the story of the Exodus, which deals primarily with Egypt, should open with a denunciation of Laban as having been worse to Israel than Pharaoh. It becomes amazing when we consider that the words on which the compiler of M relies to prove his contention, are simply misinterpreted by him. The Hebrew reads: 'arami 'obed 'abi, which can only mean, "My father was a lost Ara- 1s Excerpts from M are incorporated in Sifre Deut. 301, ed. Friedmann 128a, Finkel- stein 319; in Mekilta on Deuteronomy, reproduced from the Midrash Ha-Gadol in Midrash Tannaim, ed. Hoffman, pp. 172-173; and in Sifre Numbers 115, ed. Fried- mann 35b, Horowitz 128. It certainly provided the basis for the remark that no angel participated in the Exodus, cited in Mekilta Bo, chap. 7, Friedmann 7b, Horowitz- Rabin 23, Lauterbach I, 53; and ibid., chap. 13, Friedmann 13b, Horowitz-Rabin 43, Lauterbach I, 97.

Acad. of Jewish Research, 1931-1932, p. 41.</page><page sequence="10">300 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW maean." In order to establish the guilt of Laban, the compiler must read the words, 'arami 'ibed 'abi, "the Aramaean destroyed my father." But this is a clear distortion of the text. The daring perversion of the reading of the Scriptures can be explained only on one of two hypotheses. (A) It may have been an expression of Maccabean hostility toward Syria, which was identified with Aram."1 (B) It may be an effort, made while Palestine was under Egyptian suzerainty, to placate the Egyp- tian government, by denouncing its rival, Syria. It was par- ticularly necessary to do this before telling the story of the Exodus, which recalled unpleasant relations between Egypt and Israel. Of the two hypotheses, the second seems to me the more plausible, for several reasons which will soon become apparent. Of these, the most important is the fact that the Septuagint, which was composed by Jews under Egyptian rule, likewise per- verts the meaning of the words 'arami 'obed 'abi. Its texts render the phrase as though it read 'aram y'obed (or ye'abed) 'abi, which is forced into the sense of "My father forsook Aram." Apparently the authors of the Septuagint, like the compiler of M, hesitated to identify the ancestor of the Jews as an Aramaean. The close relationship between the Septuagint translation and the interpretation put on the phrase 'arami 'obed 'abi in M is a definite indication that the two works were composed under similar circumstances, that is in the third century B.c., and under Egyptian control.20 19 It is true that the Hellenist kingdoms of Syria and Egypt did not consider them- selves identical with the older nations of those countries, but rather part of the Mace- donian Empire, which had been divided. Nevertheless, under the stress of the bitter rivalry between the Ptolemies and the Seleucids for the control of Palestine, it is clear that a statement making Jacob an Aramaean would be definitely pro-Seleucid. For the identification of Laban with Syria, see e.g. Sanhedrin 105a, where Laban is identified with Beor the father of Balaam. Elsewhere, he is identified with Balaam himself and declared King of Aram. See Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, Index, s.v. Laban. The argument presented below remains in general equally valid if the first hypothesis be accepted; the date of M must simply be fixed, in that event, about 150 B.c. instead of between 240 and 220 B.C. 20 The Rabbinic tradition recalls the fact that the authors of the Septuagint fre- quently changed their text out of deference to Egyptian sensitivity (see Megillah 9A; Masseket Soferim 1. 8, ed. Higger, p. 101). Similarly, mediaeval copyists and printers</page><page sequence="11">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 301 A resume of the political conditions in Palestine during the third century B.C. will further demonstrate the validity of this hypothesis. The facts are easily summarized.21 From about the year 301 B.C. to 198 B.c. Palestine was under the control of the Egyptian Ptolemies. The Ptolemies did not, however, govern the country directly. They preferred to entrust as much authority as possible to the High Priests, who thus became the temporal as well as the ecclesiastical rulers of the land. Under these circumstances, it was altogether natural for the High Priests to look upon themselves as representatives not merely of the Temple but of the Imperial Egyptian Govern- ment. They, especially, must have felt that the Passover service ought to begin with a rejection of implication that the Israelites were kinsmen of the Aramaeans or Syrians. It was all the more important to make such a declaration be- cause the Scriptures lay great emphasis on the close relationship of Israel to Aram. Not only does the verse in Deuteronomy 26. 5, which is the subject of the Midrash, describe Jacob as "a wandering Aramaean," but many other passages tell how the patriarchs continually looked toward Syria and Mesopotamia as their home countries.22 And, on the other hand, the prophets were careful to avoid the use of the word Romi for Rome where that might offend the rulers of contemporary Rome, and instead wrote 'aram or 'Edom and the words 'abodah zara "strange worship" are regularly replaced in current editions of the Talmud by 'akum. "the worship of the stars and the planets," so as to avoid giving offense to Chris- tians. In each case, careful consideration of the passages would show that there was no allusion to contemporaries; but there was need of avoiding any possible imputation of giving offense. 21 For the reconstruction of the history given below, see Eduard Meyer, Ursprung und Anfaenge des Christentums, II, pp. 3 ff., 128-137; Tscherikower, Ha-Yehudim ve- ha-Yevanim, pp. 95, 183; Z.

Ptolemy, who had obtained the government of Egypt, had been driven out of Palestine in the year 315 B.c. by his rival, Antigonus. His forces returned three years later, in 312 B.C., when Antigonus was preoccupied with other wars. But they remained for only a very brief period; for Antigonus, having defeated his other enemies, soon turned his attention to Pales- tine and regained the mastery of it. It was only after Antigonus met his death at the decisive Battle of Ipsus (301 B.C.) that Ptolemy's armies once more seized the land.24 But while Ptolemy was now in undisputed possession of Palestine de facto, he found himself denied any share in it de jure. He had taken no part in the Battle of Ipsus; and the vic- tors, one of whom was his former ally, Seleucus, denied him any share in the spoils. Indeed, the victors of Ipsus had agreed among themselves that Palestine was to be awarded to Seleucus, who had become ruler of Syria. Just what happened between Egypt and Syria during the next two decades is uncertain. We know only that by the year 280 B.C. Ptolemy Philadelphus was firmly in control of Pales- tine, although the Seleucids never recognized the Egyptian claim to it. Indeed as late as the year 219 B.c., almost a cen- tury after the Battle of Ipsus, Antiochus III, the ruler of Syria, still formally claimed the right to rule Palestine by virtue of the agreements made in the year 301 B.C. From 274 to 240 B.C., there were sporadic wars between Egypt and Syria. While these were in the main fought far from the land of Israel, the fate of Palestine naturally was continually in the balance. The tension among the people is reflected in the 23 Lev. 18. 3. 24 As indicated below, historians disagree regarding the precise status of Palestine between 301 and 981 B.C. We have no definite information as to whether it was under the control of the Seleucids or the Ptolemies during most of these two decades.</page><page sequence="13">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 303 curious incidents surrounding the rise of Joseph ben Tobiah, about 240 B.C.25 Onias II, the High Priest at the time, had taken advantage of a state of war between Egypt and Syria, to refrain from sending the usual taxes to Ptolemy. When the Imperial Government protested, Joseph ben Tobiah, who was the son of the High Priest's sister, and perhaps the most opulent layman in Judea, interfered to restore peace. In recognition of this service, the Egyptian Government appointed him tax-farmer not only for all Palestine, but also for all the Egyptian possessions in Syria. The importance attached to this incident may be judged from the legends which surrounded it and which have been fully re- corded by Josephus.28 The rise of this lay family into unprece- dented prominence threatened the supremacy of the High Priesthood in Jerusalem, and doubtless was an important factor in the Hellenizing movement which reached such proportions at the beginning of the second century B.c., and which ultimately led to the religious persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes and the Maccabean Rebellion. In the year 219 B.c., Antiochus III undertook another effort to gain control of Palestine. He was defeated at the Battle of Raphia (217 B.c.); but this did not prevent him from renewing his efforts when the death of Ptolemy Philopator in the year 204 B.C. left the Egyptian rule in the hands of the regents of the five year old Ptolemy V. This time Antiochus was successful, and after 198 B.C. Palestine passed into the hands of the Seleu- cids, where it remained until it achieved its independence under the Hasmoneans. We may well imagine with what care the Egyptian govern- ment watched the development of Palestinian sympathies dur- ing this period of continuous wars. The Passover celebration which brought pilgrims to the Temple from all parts of Pales- tine, and also from other countries, was, by its very nature as has already been suggested, reminiscent of an ancient struggle between Egypt and Israel. Clearly it was essential that the High Priests divest the ceremony of any implications which 25Ha-Yehudim ve-ha-Yevanim, pp. 170 ff. 26 Antiquities XII. 3. 3.</page><page sequence="14">304 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW could possibly be interpreted as pro-Seleucidean. And it was above all, important, under the circumstances, to place a suit- able interpretation on so unfortunate a phrase - from their point of view - as, "A wandering Aramaean was my father." The High Priests had no choice but to transform the signifi- cance of the verse; and to interpret it as saying that historically there was even greater bitterness between Israel and Syria, than between Israel and Egypt! II. THE PROPAGANDIST NATURE OF M The study of the Introduction to M has shown that the work was compiled with a view to the influence it would exert on the people who recited it or heard it. This is further demonstrated by the nature of the rest of the text. The second section supple- ments the words "And he went down into Egypt," with the phrase, "Compelled thereto by the word of God." Now, the Scriptures nowhere indicate that Jacob was compelled to go to Egypt "by the word of God." On the contrary, he went to Egypt, because he discovered that Joseph was still living there. Genesis 46.3, simply relates that God assured Jacob of His pro- tection during the sojourn in Egypt; but makes not the slightest suggestion that God commanded Jacob to go down to that land. It is clear that the compiler of M attempts to reinterpret history in the light of contemporaneous conditions; and de- scribes Jacob as being forced to go to Egypt, in order to dis- courage contemporary Jews from following their ancestor's example. Absolute proof that this is the correct interpretation of M is offered by the fact that the later Egyptian Jews omitted this passage from their version of the Passover Haggadah.27 Nat- 27 See above, note 11. The Genizah fragments naturally represent the Egyptian ritual. That the Seder R. Saadia also represents that ritual is demonstrated by Pro- fessor Louis Ginzberg, in Geonica I, p. 167, note 1. It is well known that Maimonides composed his Code in Egypt, and that he followed the ritual of that country. The Yemenite Jews looked to the neighboring Jews of Egypt and especially to Maimonides for guidance in their worship. It must be noted, however, that there are a number of Genizah fragments containing the phrase, "compelled thereto, etc." (See I. Abrahams, J. Q. R., X, 1897, pp. 45, 47, 48, and 49; W. Bacher, ibid., p. 380; and Cod. Adler, in</page><page sequence="15">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 305 urally, they could not recite each year a statement which denounced them as sinful, because they lived in Egypt volun- tarily! 28 The following passage of M continues in the same vein. It insists that even those Jews who are compelled to reside in Egypt, through force of circumstance, must look on their stay as temporary, and should await the possibility of their return to Palestine.29 To emphasize this point the compiler of M stresses the fact that Jacob "did not go down into Egypt to settle there, but only to sojourn." In the third division, the compiler of M denounces the tend- ency of his contemporary Egyptian co-religionists to assimilate, by reminding them that their ancestors, the Israelites, when they resided in Egypt, were distinguished from the other people.30 Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America 2840 and 3222.) Possibly these fragments represent the rituals of localities which had come under the influence of Jews of other countries. 28 It is noteworthy that according to most texts M fails to cite any biblical verse in support of its singular statement. The only verse which is cited in any version is the irrelevant passage, Gen. 46. 3. The famous scholar, R. Elijah Gaon of Wilna, realizing the difficulty of finding some basis for the interpretation in Scripture, explains that Jacob was compelled to go to Egypt in the sense that he was destined to do so. He re- marks in his commentary (Wilna, 1818), "The meaning is that he was compelled to go to Egypt because thus was it ordained for him that he should come to Egypt; and God brought it about that he should come to Egypt through a commandment; as our Sages say, 'Jacob, our father, was fated to come to Egypt in iron chains, but his merit liber- ated him from them' (Shabbat 89b). This is what the author of the Haggadah means by the remark, 'compelled by the word' - his merit caused him to come through the word, and not in chains." Another commentator (Abraham Danzig, in his commentary, in the same edition) explains that Jacob was compelled to go to Egypt through the famine (Gen. 45. 11), which means, of course, that he was compelled by God. A later rabbinic Midrash, the author of which apparently forgot for the moment the explicit statement of M, maintains that Jacob came to Egypt of his own free will (see Mekilta, Beshallah, Proemium, ed. Friedmann 94b, Horowitz-Rabin 80, Lauterbach 1, 181). 29 For the rapid increase of the number of the Egyptian Jews during this period, see S. W. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews, I, 134 ff.; and III, 33. That many of the Jews who settled in Egypt were compelled to do so by the Egyptian govern- ment, is indicated in Josephus, Antiquities XII. 1. 1. 30 The word mezuyyanim as used in this passage of M can only mean "distinguished" in the sense of "distinct." Any attempt to give it an honorific meaning such as "noted" etc., is rendered futile by the fact that the comment is attached to the words, "And he became there a nation." Siddur Rashi and Mahzor Vitry, doubtless reflecting the</page><page sequence="16">306 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW But perhaps the clearest evidence of the propagandist nature of M is offered by the final paragraph which deals definitely with questions of theology and politics. The views expressed in that paragraph are definitely partisan, and patrician; and are clearly intended to win the masses of the pilgrims over to the views of the compiler of M. III. THE THEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL VIEWS OF THE MIDRASH A. The Existence of Personal Angels The emphatic and repeated denial in VII, I, that the angels participated in the Exodus, is the more remarkable because it directly contradicts the statement of Scripture, "He sent an angel and brought us forth out of Egypt" (Num. 20. 16).31 Indeed, the story of the Exodus itself implies that it was an angel of the Lord, rather than God, Himself, who smote the thoughts and circumstances of French Jews of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, ex- plain that the Israelites in Egypt were "distinguished" by being gathered into one locality rather than scattered in many places. Shibbale ha-Leket, however, with far closer approach to the true meaning of M, maintains that the Israelites in Egypt were distinguished by their clothes and their customs. In support of this interpretation of M, Shibbale ha-Leket cites the famous passage of Vayyikra Rabbah, "The Israelites were redeemed from Egypt for four reasons: They had not changed (a) their names or (b) their language; (c) they had spoken no evil of one another; and (d) they had re- frained from sexual impurity." (Leviticus R. 32. 5.) This interpretation is, in general, also followed by Abravanel and R. Elijah of Gaon of Wilna. The tradition that the Hebrews in Egypt did not "change their name, and did not change their language," is recorded also in Mekilta Bo, chap. 5, Friedmann 5a, Horowitz-Rabin, p. 14, Lauter- bach I, p. 34. These passages in the Rabbinic Midrashim are, of course, likewise in- tended as polemics against the assimilationist tendency of the contemporary Jews of Egypt and the other parts of the Diaspora. 31 The Septuagint to that passage, doubtless under the influence of contemporary exegesis, translates "And having sent an angel, He brought us forth from Egypt." Rashi, attempting to reconcile the biblical passage with M, interprets mal'ak in Num- bers 20. 16, as meaning a prophet, and makes the word refer to Moses. Targum Ps. Jonathan explicitly states, "And He sent one of his archangels and he brought us forth from Egypt." Apparently with a similar view in mind, the Septuagint translators of Isaiah, rendered Isaiah 63. 8b-9 not as we have it, "so He was their Saviour. In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them"; but rather, "And He became their Saviour from all their affliction. Not a messenger (apparently punctuating zir instead of zar) nor an angel, but He Himself saved them."</page><page sequence="17">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 307 first-born, for the Israelites were warned to observe every detail of the ritual carefully, that the Lord may not "suffer the destroyer to come" into their houses (Exod. 12. 23). In view of this, the insistence of the Midrash that no angel took part in the miracle of the Exodus can have but one purpose. It is, in effect, an emphatic protest against the belief in angels, as God's intermediaries, a belief which was gaining continually wider currency throughout the period of the Second Commonwealth.32 Not Gabriel, nor Michael, but God Himself, intervened for Israel in the most critical moment in its history. The authority which M gained as part of the Passover Haggadah was ultimately so great, that those who believed in personal angels felt compelled to defend their position against this implication. To achieve this purpose, they inserted, immediately after the passage denying any par- ticipation of the angels in the Exodus, the following explanatory statement, still preserved in several versions of the Haggadah: " 1 The denial that the angels participated in the Exodus is cited, with probable reference to the Passover Haggadah, in Yer. Sanhedrin 2. 1, 20a; ibid., Horayot 3. 2, 47a. Interestingly enough Mekilta insists that the destruction of the first-born did not occur through an angel (Mekilta Bo, chap. 7, Friedmann 7b, Horowitz-Rabin 23, Lauterbach 1, 53; see also parallel passage ibid., chap. 13, Friedmann 13b, Horowitz- Rabin 43, Lauterbach I, 97). The commentators on the Passover Haggadah were, of course, disturbed by the passage denying that the angels participated in the Exodus, in view of the statement in Numbers 20. 16, and especially in view of the fact that Moses was clearly the "messenger" of God at the Exodus. They offer various explana- tions of the difficulty. Abravanel insists that it only means that God redeemed the Israelites, but He made use of "different instruments," in accomplishing His will; R. Yom Tob ben Abraham of Seville maintains that the redemption occurred without any intermediary, and he explains Numbers 20. 16, precisely as does the Septuagint. The same interpretation is cited also in Shibbale ha-Leket. With the various state- ments denying the use of angels as intermediaries, cf. also Sifre Deut. 325 (Fr. 139a), which comments on the verse, "To Me belongeth vengeance and recompense" (Deut. 32. 35), as follows: "I Myself will punish them; I will not punish them through an angel or an intermediary." 33 See excerpts from Seder R. Saadia, printed in Frunkin, Seder R. Amram, Jerusa- lem, 1912, p. 108b; Mahzor Vitry, p. 293; Siddur Rashi, p. 193; according to the rite of Yemen, the Haggadah according to the rite of Bagdad, edds. Calcutta, 1844, and 1889, and Bombay, 1887; and lastly in the appendix to E. D. Goldschmidt, Die Pessach- Haggada, p. 111. The passage is also cited in Midrash Ha-Gadol, on Exodus, 14. 25, ed. Hoffmann, p. 52. But, as Professor Louis Ginzberg surmised (Geonica, 1, p. 167, note 1, and more explicitly in Legends of the Jews, V. p. 433, note 213) this passage is not a genuine part of the Mekilta of R. Simeon. This can now be demonstrated by the</page><page sequence="18">308 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Our teachers,34 of blessed memory, have said: When the Holy One, blessed be He, descended into Egypt, against the Egyptians, there descended with Him nine thousand myriads of beings. Some of them were angels of fire, some of them angels of hail, some of them angels of fright, some of them angels of trembling, some of them angels of trepidation. Trembling and trepidation seize anyone who beholds them. They said to God, "Master of the Universe, When a human king goes to war, his princes and servants surround him. And Thou art the King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He; is it not appropriate " since we are Thy servants, and they are the children of Thy covenant, that we should descend, and wage war against the Egyptians." He answered, however, "My feelings will not be assuaged until I, Myself, in My glory, in My greatness, and in My Holiness, descend against them. I am the Lord, I am He, and no other!" The author of this interpolation apparently did not feel free to contradict the statement of M denying that the angels par- ticipated in the Exodus. He simply endeavors to reconcile it with the views of those who believe in the existence of cohorts of angelic intermediaries. The angels might have intervened at the Exodus; but God would not permit them to do so. This cannot, however, have been the thought in the mind of the compiler of M. On the contrary, he obviously wishes to deny that angels can act as intermediaries between God and man. In so doing, he enters into the long controversy about the existence of angels,"6 which beginning with Haggai and Zecha- riah (ca. 520B.c.) continued until the compilation of the Mishna (740 years afterwards) and even later. Throughout fact that it is lacking in the Genizah fragments of the Mekilta of R. Simeon to the pas- sage (see Jewish Studies in Memory of George Alexander Kohut, Hebrew section, p. 114). Nevertheless the ascription of the saying to R. Meir may be correct. At any rate it is certain that despite the authority of the Passover Haggadah and the Mekilta of R. Ishmael, many later scholars insisted that God descended to Egypt to redeem Israel, surrounded by hosts of angels. Indeed Shemot Rabbah explicitly states, in the comment on the verse, "For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians" (Exod. 12. 23), "Some say through an angel, and some say the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself" (Shemot Rabbah 17. 5). 4 With one slight deviation (indicated in the next note) I have followed the text of the interpolation as found in the Passover Haggadah used in the ritual of Bagdad. 36 Reading din hu, with the other texts, rather than dayyan hu (He is the Judge) with the ritual of Bagdad. 36 See Pharisees, pp. 160 ff. The controversy is described in Acts 23. 8, as sectarian, dividing the Pharisees, who accepted the belief in angels, from the Sadducees, who re- jected it. But as suggested in Pharisees, pp. 181 ff., the controversy is not mentioned by Josephus or the Rabbinic Sages, because there were a considerable number of Phari-</page><page sequence="19">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 309 this time, the patricians of Palestine denied, while the plebeians asserted, the existence of angels as intermediary beings between God and man. No one but a violent partisan would have drawn such a controversial issue into a text intended for universal use. The fact that the author of M did so, stamps him as a patrician, with pronounced factional views. Moreover, since M, in spite of its partisanship, was adopted by plebeians no less than patricians, for the Passover evening service, the author must have been a person of recognized au- thority. We may rightly conclude from this alone that he was a distinguished priest, probably a High Priest. It is improbable, however, that even the authority of a High Priest would have induced the plebeian opposition to accept such a document after the quarrel between John Hyrkan and the Pharisees. It follows, therefore, that the document must have been compiled before that time. This tentative conclusion is confirmed by more cogent evi- dence which we will now consider. B. The Appearance of God in Visible Form The assertion that God appeared in visible form at the Exodus is a second theological statement of great importance. Like the question of the angels, so the question of the possibility of the appearance of the Deity in visible form was long disputed during the Second Commonwealth. In fact, as Leszynsky and Lauterbach 37 have pointed out, the issue was the basis of one of the major controversies between the Pharisees and the Sad- ducees, that regarding the manner in which the High Priest was to perform the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement. The Pharisees, as is well known, demanded that in accordance with the precise order of the biblical verses, the High Priest enter the sees themselves who opposed the highly developed angelology of later times. Perhaps they found support for their views in M. Nevertheless, it remains true that the Phari- sees as a body refused to deny the existence of personal angels; and certainly would not have sanctioned the formulation of a Passover service which implied such a denial. 37 Leszynsky, Die Sadduzaeer, p. 62; Lauterbach, Hebrew Union College Annual, IV (1927), pp. 185 ff., and see Pharisees, pp. 118 ff.</page><page sequence="20">310 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Holy of Holies, with a censer of fire in one hand and the incense in the other; and that only after he had entered the Holy Cham- ber should he put the incense on the fire. The Sadducees de- clared that he should put the incense on the fire before entering the Sacred Chamber. As the scholars mentioned indicate, the Sadducees were moved to their view by their belief that God appeared in visible form in the Holy Chamber. To protect himself from seeing the Vision, the High Priest was to enter the Chamber behind a cloud of smoking incense. The Pharisees, who denied that God could be seen, insisted that the High Priest bear witness to his ac- ceptance of their teaching, by entering the Holy Chamber, and performing the ceremony there. In their opposition to anthropomorphism, the plebeian schol- ars transformed all the passages in Scripture which spoke of "seeing God," into "appearing before God." This involved but a slight change of pronunciation in Hebrew; but it was fundamental to the theology of the plebeians. In fact, there can be little doubt that as Geiger has pointed out,38 the verse ubemora' gadol which is translated "and with great terribleness," was originally read ubemar'eh gadol "and with a great Vision." Only the reading ubemar'eh gadol could justify the interpretation, "this refers to the visible manifesta- tion of God." And it is this reading which is reflected in the Sep- tuagint, the Syriac, and most surprisingly of all, the Aramaic, versions.39 38 Geiger, Urschrift, pp. 339 ff. 39 Similar renderings of ubemora' are found also in the Septuagint, Peshitta, and Targumim to Deut. 4. 34, and Jer. 32.21. It is also found in Peshitta and Targumim to Deut. 34. 12. The Vulgate which in all the passages cited follows the Massoretic readings, translates the phrase in Deut. 4. 34, horribiles visiones, combining both senses. Geiger's view gains curious support from Sifre Deut. 161, Friedmann 105b, Finkel- stein 219, which reads, according to the best texts (Vatican Ms. and commentary of R. Hillel): " That he may learn to fear the Lord his God. This teaches us that the Vision leads to reading the Scripture; reading the Scripture leads to translation; translation leads to study of the Mishna; study of the Mishna leads to discussion; discussion leads to deeds; deeds lead to fear (of God)." In ed. pr. as well as in the texts of the Yalkut, and the Mss. of the British Museum and Oxford, the word she-ha-mar'eh "for the vision" has been altered to she-ha-mora' "for the fear," which makes no sense what- ever, since the series begins with "the fear" and ends with "the fear." It seems clear</page><page sequence="21">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 311 We do not know the precise date when the reading ubemora' gadol (and with great terribleness) was substituted for ubemar'eh gadol (and with a great Vision). Certainly, it was before the year 100 of our era, for Aquila, who translated the Scriptures about that time, renders the phrase as though he had our present Massoretic text. It is evident, however, that no matter how late the change in vocalization was made, the controversy regarding God's ap- pearance in visible form is a most ancient one. Not only was it one of the fundamental controversies between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, but references to it appear in Scripture itself. Under the circumstances, we must assume that the compiler of M, in interpreting the words ubemar'eh gadol as referring to the Visible Appearance of God, had in mind the controversy on the subject, and was endeavoring to clothe his teachings with the authority of an accepted and well-known Midrash.40 This passage, then, like that regarding the angels, would indicate that the compiler was a patrician, and that he lived before the Pharisaic Order had attained sufficient power to prevent an that the later copyists, recoiling from the implication that God might appear in visible form, changed the original mar'eh into mora'. This renders it the more likely that a similar development occurred in the biblical texts. It is interesting to note that the texts of the Sifre in which the reading mor'a has been substituted for mar'eh belong to the French group (see Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research, 1981-1932, pp. 7 ff.). And curiously enough, as we have seen (note 16), it is in the French school that we find the clearest anticipation of Geiger's theory that mora' was originally mar'eh. It must further be noted that apparently the baraita in the Sifre, which is now asso- ciated as indicated with Deut. 17. 19, really is a comment on the similar verse, Deut. 14. 23, which remarks concerning the tithes and the pilgrimages, "that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always." The author of the statement in the Sifre indi- cates the steps by which this fear of God is attained. The pilgrim comes to Jerusalem and sees the Vision of the Glory; this leads him to study, etc.; study leads to deeds; and deeds lead to the fear of God. Perhaps it was an early objection to the association of the Vision of God with the pilgrimage that caused the passage to be transferred in the first place to the verse about the King, where it was considered rather innocuous. 40 It is probable that as with regard to the question of angels, so with regard to the issue of the appearance of God in visible form, the authority which attached to M as part of the Passover-Haggadah helped to preserve its view among patrician scholars.

IV. CONCLUSION We have thus succeeded in showing that M is definitely con- troversial in its theology, presenting forcefully two patrician doctrines, namely the denial of the angels, and the possibility of God's appearance in visible form. Both of these doctrines were opposed by the main body of the Pharisees, viz. the plebeians, though they received some support from the patrician minority of the Order. It is inconceivable that after the organ- ization of the Pharisaic Order, either doctrine could have been included in a tract intended for universal use on the Passover night. Their inclusion in M indicates that it originated before the rise of the Pharisaic Order, and therefore before the Macca- bean period. The subjects of angels and the appearance of God in visible form were already controversial issues, however; and the compiler was trying to use the Passover celebration to foist his opinions on the people. The patrician character of the teachings points to a priest as the compiler. And the fact that the Pharisees, both the plebeian and the patrician wings,4' accepted M in the Passover service, indicates that the compiler was a man of the widest possible recognition. This, together with the consideration that Simeon the Righteous is known for other contributions to the liturgy,42 makes it likely that he was himself the compiler. This conclusion is supported by a consideration of the his- torical background which alone can account for the reference to Aram in the Introduction to M. In the Appendix, further evidence will be presented regarding the propagandist character of M, and for its patrician origin. 41 Concerning the two factions of the Pharisees, see Professor L. Ginzberg, Mekomah shel ha-halakah be-hokmat yisrael, p. 14.

Several passages in M which cursorily read seem to have no special significance, turn out on examination to be quite im- portant. One of these is II, 3, which cites in support of the phrase, "Few in number," the verse Deut. 10. S2. There are at least two other verses in the Pentateuch (Gen. 46. 27; Exod. 1. 5) which tell us that Jacob came to Egypt with a family of seventy souls. Either of them would have been in many re- spects more appropriate to the Midrash than the one cited; for they are direct records of the story rather than citations from the remarks of Moses, as is the verse actually quoted. They are passed over, however, in favor of the verse from Deuteronomy, because the latter stressed what was uppermost in the mind of the compiler: the contrast between the small number of Israel- ites who came to Egypt, and the large number who were de- scended from them. So important does this particular point seem to the compiler that he cites two other verses to prove his point. And we note that these other verses, likewise, stress the rapidity of the increase of the Israelites. Perhaps the compiler is trying to indicate in his Midrashic manner, that while he discourages emigration to Egypt, the Egyptian Jews need have no fear for their numbers. With the Divine blessing on them, their community will grow by natural increase. The fifth section simply cites Exodus 1. 8-10, as illustrating Deut. 9.6. 6. In the sixth section, the compiler of M protests bitterly against the hardships of the Egyptian bondage. This may seem quite appropriate in a Midrash dealing with the Exodus. Yet some parts of the section show that the compiler is thinking of contemporary situations. When he interprets the words, "And He saw our affliction," to refer to "forcible separation from marital intercourse," he cannot be speaking of ancient Egypt, for there is no record that Egyptians inflicted such persecution on the Hebrews. It is a plausible surmise that the compiler of M has in mind the contemporary conscription of Jewish young men into the Egyptian armies, and the consequent interference</page><page sequence="24">314 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW with their family life. This interpretation is supported by the following passage which reads, "And our toil. This refers to the children, as it is said, 'Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter shall ye save alive'" (Exod. 1. 2). Once more the compiler is thinking of the seizure of young men in his own time, and comparing it to the even bloodier destruc- tion of male children by the ancient Pharaoh.43 The commentators on the Haggadah have found perhaps the greatest difficulty with the following phrase: "and our oppres- sion, this refers to the oppression, as it is said, 'Moreover I have seen the oppressions wherewith the Egyptians oppress them"' (Exod. 3. 9). The compiler apparently adds nothing to the meaning of the text. But for some special reason he substitutes for the biblical word ha-lahaz (oppression) the neo-Hebraic ha-dohak, yet, peculiarly enough, cites a verse containing the word to support his interpretation! It was natural for the commentators to suppose that the com- piler was referring to some special form of persecution. But if we accept the third century B.c. as the date of the composition of M, the difficulty disappears. The readers and hearers of M knew well what oppression by Egyptian rulers meant; they suffered it every day. Quite aside from any detailed orders which they had to obey, they were conscious of continual petty oppression by the local Egyptian representatives. The most obscure passages in M are perhaps VII, 2, and VII, 3, explaining the phrases "with a mighty hand," and "with an outstretched arm." The mighty hand is interpreted as the "murrain"; and the outstretched arm as "the sword." Several questions come to our mind as we read these passages. Why should the compiler refer to the murrain rather than any of the other ten plagues? The question apparently occurred also to the talmudic authorities for they interpret the phrase, the mighty hand in Deut. 34. 12 as referring to all the ten 43 It is also possible that the author wishes to avoid the implication that work as such is degrading or an evil to be avoided. He hesitates, therefore, to interpret "our toil" literally; God, in his opinion, would not have been moved simply by seeing the people at labor.</page><page sequence="25">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 315 plagues, and cite in support of their view, Exod. 10. 12 ("And the Lord said unto Moses, 'Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts"'). Others explain, that the mighty hand in that passage refers to the slaying of the first-born.44 But even more difficult is the reference to the sword.45 There is no record in the story of the Exodus of any battle between the Israelites and the Egyptians. Indeed the sword was conspicuously absent as a means of liberation of the Israel- ites. Everything happened through the hand of God. It is clearly a forced interpretation of M to suppose that the sword refers to the Divine sword through which the first-born of Egypt were slain. To escape the difficulty, the later sages in- vented a tale according to which the first-born of Egypt, fearing death because of the threat of Moses, turned in battle against their fathers, and sought to compel Egypt to liberate the Israelites.46 But that can hardly have been in the mind of the original compiler. What is perhaps even stranger than the invention of a battle against the Egyptians, is the citation in this connection of a verse recording the punishment of David and Jerusalem! The sword which the angel held in his hand, according to 1 Chron- icles 21. 16, was directed against Jerusalem, in punishment for David's sin in counting the people. Why should such a memory 44 The first interpretation is found in Midrash Tannaim 34. 12, p. 228; the second is found there as an alternative interpretation, and in Sifre Deut. 357, 150b as the only interpretation. The statement of R. Joshua ben Levi that with each of the ten plagues the Egyptians suffered also from pestilence (Shemot Rabbah 10. 1) may be intended as an explanation of this passage. It may be that R. Joshua could only explain the reference to deber (murrain) as meaning "pestilence" rather than "murrain," and that since it was mentioned so prominently in M, he presumed that it accompanied each of the ten plagues. This interpretation is supported by R. Aaron Ha-Kohen of Lunel (Orhot Hayyim, I, 83A), and the author of Kol Bo. 45 It is particularly difficult to explain this passage in view of the fact that the verse cited in support of the interpretation that "arm" means "the sword," does not contain the word "arm" but only the word "hand." To overcome this difficulty several com- mentators indicate that the word on which the author relies to prove the interference of the "sword" in the Exodus, is Netuyah "outstretched," which occurs in both verses. 46 Pesikta of R.

The answers given to these questions can only be tentative. I believe that in these comments the High Priest was indicating as carefully as he could his real purpose in formulating M. He was in fact trying to arouse the people to resistance against the Egyptians; and it was for that very reason that the tale of the ancient Exodus was to be formulated so effectively. The assem- bled people were to be taught that ancient Egypt had been de- feated in two ways: through the murrain which God sent upon their cattle, and through armed battle.47 That the latter teaching was without support in Scripture was a matter of little concern to an author who did not hesitate to give his own interpretation to an explicit verse. The verse cited from Chronicles may have been especially attractive to the High Priestly compiler because it recalled a sin of David, and thus reflected ill on the Davidic dynasty. We know from Deutero-Zechariah (12. 12) that the family of David played an important r6le in the second century B.c. and indeed remnants of the family were pointed out centuries later. It suited the interests of the High Priestly dynasty admirably to use the occasion of the Passover to cast reflections on the rival House of David. APPENDIX II. THE RELATION OF THE MIDRASH TO RABBINIC LITERATURE The Rabbinic Sages, who accepted M as part of the Passover Haggadah, seem to have felt that it originated in patrician circles. We have noted that M is cited intact by the Mekilta on Deuteronomy,48 which was the work of the patrician school of R. Ishmael; but is rejected, at least in part, by the Sifre on Deuteronomy, which is the work of the plebeian school of 47 This interpretation is apparently put on the passage also by E. D. Goldschmidt in his Die Pessach-Haggada, p. 56, note 1. 48 Preserved in Midrash Ha-Gadol, and printed therefrom in Midrash Tannaim 26. 5-8, pp. 172-173. For the patrician origin of the Mekilta on Deuteronomy see D. Hoffmann, Einleitung in die halachischen Midrashim, Berlin, 1887, pp. 72 ff., and also his introduction to the edition of the Midrash Tannaim.</page><page sequence="27">THE OLDEST MIDRASH 317 R. Akiba.49 Furthermore, its denial that the angels partici- pated in the Exodus is quoted twice in the Mekilta of R. Ishmael on Exodus, another patrician work, but not in the corresponding sections of the Mekilta of R. Simeon on the same book, a ple- beian work. The political passages of the seventh section of the Midrash, dealing with the murrain and the sword, are cited in the Sifre on Numbers, also a patrician work.50 Finally, the ex- pression, "Go forth and learn," clearly a school term at the time of the original of the Midrash, disappeared from the later school vocabulary, and is cited only three times in Rabbinic literature, twice in definitely patrician works,5" and once by R. Jose ben Halafta,52 whose Galilean upbringing made him more inclined than others to patrician speech. 49 See Sifre Deut. 301, Friedmann 128a, Finkelstein 319. (a) The Sifre rejects the interpretation that 'arami 'obed 'abi, means that "the Aramaean sought to destroy my father." Instead of that, it says, "This teaches us that our father Jacob went to Aram in order to be destroyed." The following statement, "And therefore Laban is accounted as though he had destroyed him," clearly contradicts the interpretation that Jacob came to Aram to be destroyed. For why should Laban be accounted guilty for something which he could not control, had it happened; and ultimately did not happen? It is clear that although all the texts have preserved both statements as one, they are really two distinct interpretations. According to the first, Jacob is called a "lost (or wandering) Aramaean," because when he came to Aram, he seemed fated for destruc- tion. According to the second, as in the Passover Haggadah, Laban is accounted as though he had destroyed him. (b) The phrase, "this teaches us that Jacob did not go down to Egypt to settle there, but only to sojourn etc.," is found in the French texts of the Sifre, but is omitted in all the better texts, showing as indicated in ed. Finkelstein, loc. cit., that it is not part of the Sifre. (c) The remainder of the Midrash is summarized in the briefest manner. 5o Sifre Numbers 115, Friedmann 35b, Horowitz 128. 51 Mekilta Jethro, Bahodesh, chap. 8, Friedmann 70b, Horowitz-Rabin 953, Lau- terbach II, and parallel passage, Sanhedrin 86a; and Sifre Numbers 115, Friedmann 85b, Horowitz 128. 52 Sifra, Vayyikra, parasha 12. 10.</page></plain_text>
