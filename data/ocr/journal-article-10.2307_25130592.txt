<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Archaeological Review, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1996 Book Review Editor's Note. Situated in the northeastern corner of Africa, Egypt developed an impressive African civilization. For some, this civilization was a product of an incoming race of Caucasians who intermingled with the indigenous Negroes. They were responsible for divine kingship both in Egypt and elsewhere (Seligman, 1913). Confusing "race" with language and culture, Seligman identified Egyptian religion as a Hamitic import. Breasted (1926) held that the Sahara separated Egypt from the rest of Africa. These theories are no longer credible in the light of more recent work and upon further reflection. Even then, Budge (1911) argued against the prevailing racialist theories, suggesting that Egyptian religion originated from African beliefs rather than those of the ancient Near East or Europe. Frankfort (1949), whose pioneer work on Egyptian symbolism is remarkably insightful, advocated that Egyptian culture arose out of a great East African substratum. In a recent book, B. C. Ray (1991) discusses these views in the light of his work on kingship in Buganda. He suggests that many similarities between divine kingship in Africa and that in Egypt are also shared with divine kingships elsewhere. Nevertheless, he asserts that the roots of Egyptian kingship clearly lie in the prehistoric cultures of the Nile Valley. He also points out that the rise of Ganda kingship in the far distant Lake Victoria postdates that of Egypt by 4400 years. Recent discoveries do show that the emergence of Egyptian kingship was preceded by a long evolutionary process. Chiefdoms seem to date back to at least 4000 Calib BC during the Badarian, and social complexity might have begun earlier in the Sahara among cattle herders (Wendorf et ai, 1992-1993). The Badarian pottery suggests Saharan-Sudanese affinities. Surely, there is a common East African substratum for the Egyptian Predynastic. There are also the continuation of trade relations between Egypt and Africa and the interactions between Egypt and other African civilizations (e.g., Kerma and Meroe). In addition to intercultural transmissions, we should not also discount convergence as a result of similar structural situations. 153 0263-0338/96/0600-0153$09.50/0 ? 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">154 Book Review Egyptologists, as Ray (1991, p. 184) has indicated, have eschewed the question of the connection between Egypt and Africa, perhaps because of doubtful interpretations of Egyptian texts. However, Henri Frankfort [(1948) 1978, p. 6] suggested that African ethnography is useful "to pene trate behind the words of our [Egyptian]" texts (cited by Ray, 1991, p. 198). We may also add that African archaeology and Egyptology have a lot to gain from comparative analysis with meticulous attention to historical con text, plausible connections, and chronological order.

It constitutes at least one-third of the book. One of the two movements is termed "the new solar theology" and is placed within the historical context of the reign of Amenhotep III and Akhenaten (ca. 1420-1360 BC). The second is represented by the theology of the Theban Amun-Re, which he divides into two phases, the first dating from Hatshepsut to Amenhotep II (ca. 1500-1425) and the second in the Ramesside period, with the hymns dating to the Nineteenth Dynasty ca. 1320-1200 BC. The author places his material in three categories: (1) esoteric texts that contain knowledge of the temple cult and have a long transmission period; (2) standard texts, which consist of the hymn pair often found in private tombs, praising the sun god at its rising and setting; and (3) those hymns which have an individual character, which we meet in the "productive" stage, still fluid in their expression. It is the latter texts, found within a historical context, which allow the author to give a chronological analysis to the development of solar religion. The book, divided into an introduction and seven chapters, devotes the first two chapters to the traditional solar theology. The first of these, "The Mysteries of the Sun Cult" (pp. 16-37), deals with the secret knowledge which energizes the cult. The journey of the sun is divided into two aspects: the role of the eastern ba's (which are equated with the divine worshippers of the god found at the eastern horizon to greet him at his rising, and often represented as baboons) and the passage way of the solar journey, with its many stations and dangers. Through recitation of the hymn, the king, or his substitute the priest, clears the way for the sun god by destroying his enemies. The recitation strengthens the god in his daily journey, thus preserving the cosmos, kingship and mankind. The king, through identification with the forces accompanying the sun god, participates in the journey and in this way establishes a connection between the cosmos and society. The second chapter, "The Iconography of the Solar Journey" (pp. 38 66), deals with the mythic aspect of the solar journey and provides some conceptual tools for its interpretation. For Assmann the term "iconogra phy" does not refer to pictorial material but to the literary imagery of the text. He uses the term "icon" as the operative unit of iconography. Given the nonnarrative form in which myth occurs in the text, this imagery con veys the mythological content of the solar journey, "depicting" mythic episodes. The journey is related as a series of events, occurring in cosmic time. It has a four-phase structure: (1) rising, (2) crossing the day sky, (3) setting, and (4) journeying through the night sky. It is related to phases in the life of the god: birth (child), rulership (manhood), death (old age), and trans</page><page sequence="5">Book Review 157 figuration ("deceased"). Assmann sees the correlation between the phases of the journey and the stages of life as the result of "analogical thought," which, in its conceptual integration of parallel events, allows the cosmic and anthropomorphic to merge. The four phases of the solar journey take on a temporal aspect as morning (rising), midday (day journey), evening (setting), and night (night journey). In the morning the god is born, appears, illuminates the earth, and is greeted by the eastern ba's or the group of gods known as the Ennead. The midday journey of the god is associated with the rule and triumph of law and order (Maat). As the sun is at its zenith, the god meets the Apophis-serpent, the representative of disorder and evil, and the boat runs aground on a sandbank. In some versions this is caused by Apophis (or a turtle) drinking up all the water of the heav enly river. Seth punctures the beast, who then releases the water and the bark can travel on. This version indicates the association between disorder and drought/famine, reflected in the expression "the Sandbank of Apophis," used in this context during the First Intermediate Period (ca. 2180-2040 BC). A victory celebration is associated with the defeat of Apophis. The last two phases, the evening setting and the night journey, are grouped together. Assmann discerns five mythic episodes (or icons), in this combined phase as the sun god moves from west to east. Beginning with landing in the west and entering the arms of the western mountain, the night journey culminates as the god reaches the inhabitants of the underworld, the dead, bringing light and joy to them. This last phase is also expressed in terms of different forms of union between the "living" and the "dead," such as the union between the bird-headed "soul" known as the ba and the corpse of the god, or the union between the sun god Re and the funerary, mummiformed god Osiris. The first two chapters provide orientation in the traditional ahisto rical polytheistic solar theology in which the solar journey is enacted by "constellations" of divine beings, and mankind's participation is limited to that which can be accomplished through identification with these be ings. It is against this background that Assmann contrasts the historical development of two new movements. The third chapter ("The Phenomenology of the Solar Journey," pp. 67-101) turns to the solar hymns of an individual character to clarify what Assmann sees as a historical development of the new solar theology. He characterizes it as diametrically opposed to the traditional theology by its "blurring of 'icons,' dismantling of 'constellations,' denial of participation by knowledge and identification, and the replacement of the 'mythic' by the 'cosmic' dimension" (p. 67). He finds the differences between the new</page><page sequence="6">158 Book Review solar theology and Amarna theology in nuances, with the more radical Amarna version failing in the manner of its enforcement and the role given the king; thus the two are not treated as separate phenomena. The term "phenomenology" is applied to the reinterpretation of the solar journey as a physical phenomenon, rather than a series of mythic episodes. Knowledge of the god is limited, in the new solar theology, to that which can be observed by man. The solar disk is no longer an attribute of the god but is the god himself, who has essentially two characteristics: light (including air) and movement. The deities that accompanied him on his journey become aspects of his physical manifestation, such as his fiery heat. And thus the god is alone on his journey. In the polytheistic tradition the events of the solar journey take place within a pattern of interaction with other gods and mankind's perspective is excluded. In the new solar theology, however, it is man's view that domi nates, being the only reference point for divine acts. The presence of the god in the world of man is seen in his radiance, his rays (stwt) being equated with both beauty (nfrw) and love (mrwi). They are also the manifestation of his gaze and represent an "eye to eye" contact as a medium of com munication between creator and creation. The omnipresence of the god is indicated by the light that is found everywhere. The traditional solar theology tends to distinguish between the creator and the life-giver as separate aspects of the god. The new solar theology puts the role of life-giver in the center and equates it with a process of creatio continua. Creation is not a generational production of new deities but the coming into being of biological life and its organization on earth. The sun god is the source of the life-giving elements, of light, air, and time. Creation and preservation are equated. The rays of the sun (light, air) and its movement (time) are regarded as expressions of parental care. In the perspective of the new solar theology, man is created as the child and image of the god and receives life from him in a continuous stream. This is in terrupted only when night falls, and the mythic episode of the night journey is replaced by a description of the absence of light, life, and a return to the precreation state. The last four chapters of the book are devoted to the development of the theology of the Theban Amun-Re. This is divided into two historical periods which frame that of the new solar theology. The material associated with the first period (Hatshepsut-Amenhotep II) is discussed in Chapter 4 ("Amun Theology of the Early Period," pp. 102-132) and consists of eulogies in which the nature of the god is described by epithets. Assmann sees three main themes in these epithets, Amun-Re as ruler, primeval god, and the preserver, the latter coinciding with descriptions of the god as the</page><page sequence="7">Book Review 159 source of light. A smaller group of texts deals with epithets of the falcon headed sun god Re-Harakhty in which he occurs as the sun itself. The image of the god which emerges is one which is related to the Middle Kingdom image of the king, as benefactor, shepherd, and ethical authority. The solar journey is described from the perspective of an an thropocentric cosmology and takes place for the sake of mankind. The number and level of articulation of the texts found in the earliest group indicate a fully developed theological discourse that was dissemi nated by means of the hymns, and that also incorporated what might be characterized as the first wave of personal piety (see below). The culmination of the trends seen both in the new solar theology and in the early period of the Amun-Re theology takes places in the Ra messide period, described in the last three chapters of this study (originally one in the German edition). The first of these (Chapter 5, "Ba. Hiddenness and Oneness," pp. 133-155) begins by delineating eight characteristics of the Ramesside theology. (1) Amun-Re is said to be one and hidden. (2) His manifested forms are designated as his ba's. (3) Despite his oneness he makes himself into millions. (4) The world is tripartite to accommodate his ba in heaven, his image on earth, and his body in the underworld. (5) The god is life-giving in the form of light, air, and water (6) and all per vasive in the form of air. (7) He is a god of time and fate and, as such, (8) has a personal aspect as an ethical authority. Each of these themes has a history but is developed during the thirteenth century BC to create the formulation of Amun-Re as a personal world-god. The oneness of the god is expressed in many ways; he is the primeval pr?existent god and the creator from which the world emanates. However, that which he creates is diversified in its plurality. The reconciliation of the oneness of the god and the plurality of his creation is expressed in terms of his hidden or transcendent unity. His hidden power is manifested by the multiplicity of his ba's which assume form in many gods. Ultimately the god is visible in the entire cosmos. Explication of Amun-Re as latent in all his creation is found in a text describing Amun's ten ba's, of which the first five represent the elements: the sun and moon (time), air, water, and light (named as the goddess Tefnut). The second five represent classifications of beings: humans, quadrupeds (lion), birds (falcon), aquatic creatures (crocodile), and terrestrial creatures (snake). The god, as creator of the world, transforms himself into the totality of the divine forces at work in the creation and maintenance of the world. The sixth chapter ("Cosmic God and Saviour," pp. 156-189) describes the character given the creation in the Ramesside theology. The well-known Leiden Amun hymn is seen as an integration of three gods of the cities of Thebes, Memphis and Heliopolis, with Amun given priority as representing</page><page sequence="8">160 Book Review the first transformation as the eight primeval gods, Ptah-Tatenen appearing as the next phase as the primeval mound, and the third stage involving the Heliopolitan god Re removing himself to heaven. Other versions of Theban creation also reveal a concentration on the self-generation of the god, the organization of life on earth, and the eventual removal of the god to his solitary existence in heaven. The world as created by Amun-Re has three levels: heaven to accom modate his ba, earth for his image, and the underworld for his corpse. He fills each of these levels, extending himself in all directions and thus personifies the cosmos. This three-level system interconnects with Amun-Re's role as life-giver in which he is manifested in air, light, and water, which are in turn associated with the emanations of the physical being of the deity as his breath (air), eye/sight (light), and secretions (water). A fourth element, earth, is added when Amun-Re is represented as a ba with four heads in which four ba's, representing the four Heliopolitan generations, are united: those of (Re-)Khepri (light), Shu (air), Geb (earth), and Osiris (water). The final chapter, "Judge and Saviour: The God of the Individual" (pp. 190-210), addresses issues which are central to the development of Ramesside religiosity, that of personal piety and the role of fate. The term personal piety refers to the emergence of a personal, rather than cultic, relationship between the individual and the deity. It is often regarded as having its origin in the Ramesside period, although there are those that see it as a structural feature not always evident in the surviving documen tation. Assmann takes the position that it is a historical development and suggests the inclusion of "history" as a fourth dimension to the schema which includes the political, cosmic, and mythic dimensions of religious ex perience. He argues that the historical experiences of the New Kingdom influence the introduction of the concepts of divine intervention and ex pressions of divine will, making a distinction between an earlier "theology of preservation" and the Ramesside "theology of will." In this context, life becomes an individual blessing (swt) of god. The experience of instability has made the world unintelligible. The only fixed point is god. Man requires personal contact with god; he needs to put god in his heart and to surrender to his leadership. Piety and devotion become the principle of personal identity and harmony. Success is no longer the inevitable consequence of good deeds guaranteed by the principle of Maat, but is the gift of god alone and is entirely at his disposal. And as the lord of time, the god also controls the future and man's fate. The god who functions as savior and helper of the oppressed is also the dispenser of justice, the punisher of evil. The god has two faces, both creator and destroyer, giver of both life and death. This dual role is close to the Middle Kingdom imagery of king. In the Ramesside theology the</page><page sequence="9">Book Review 161 god has penetrated into the functions of the king as judge and ethical authority. There is no longer a heaven and earth division of spheres of authority. Instead the king is the representative, the mirror image of god on earth. Amun-Re be comes a model both for the kingship and for mankind itself in his role of compassionate benefactor and judge. Assmann sees this change in perception, from an impersonal god who interacts with other gods to a deity who has a personal authority over the individual, as one which involves all aspects of Egyptian life and regards it as the result of an estrangement from the principle of Maat, in which an abstract concept is replaced by the individualized notion of divine favor. Maat is thereby absorbed into the divine will. This concept of a personal world god, who also incorporates a cosmic deity, comes to influence the idea of the divine into late antiquity and the Hermetic literature, which serves as a vehicle for the transmission of this con cept into the Middle Ages and beyond to the nineteenth century. The erudition which the author displays in his structuring and thematic interpretation of the texts is impressive. However, in a broad sense, the picture painted of the development of the characteristics of god in the New Kingdom is not a new one. The "uniqueness" of the god in his increasing association with the primeval/creator god and the status of the Ramesside deity as a per sonal god, ethical authority, and lord of fate are aspects of the theology of the period which are generally recognized. However, the integration of the "natural" attributes of the god (light, air, movement) into a holistic view of the deity's cosmic nature and the development of the theme of the ba as a manifestation of a hidden power contribute in a stimulating manner to the discussion of the "One and the Many,"4 which for Assmann becomes the "One in the Many." However, the hypothesis that places these texts in the context of two historical "religious movements" presents difficulties. The sun hymns are said to have arisen from "a collective debate about the problems and phe nomena relating to Egyptian solar religion" (p. 2) and to "reveal the theological process of solar religion in its temporal, spatial and sociological dimensions" (p. 3). The historical specificity of the texts is clear. The topog raphical distribution of the origin of these texts, to Heliopolis and Thebes, is plausible. The sociological dimension is more difficult to grasp. Accord ing to Assmann, the abundance of tomb inscriptions allows an assessment of the extent to which religious knowlege penetrated nonpriestly sectors of the population. This entails a distinction between the two groups and that the nonpriestly, literate, population developed religious ideas in literary 4This is a reference to Erik Hornung's classic work from 1971, which, in its English version, is titled The Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt. The One and the Many, translated by John Baines, London, 1982.</page><page sequence="10">162 Book Review form for their own benefit: "It was not a particular tradition that led to the production of these texts, but rather a religious process of enormous 'popularity' that created its own tradition" (p. 7). Thus the innovation seen in these texts represents a response to the personal needs of the tomb own ers. At the same time he states in the preface to the English edition that he believes that the term theography "writing about god" is more suitable than theology "speaking about god." This differentiation in terminology emphasizes that the author sees this discourse as primarily a literary prod uct, an "intertextual" dialogue, suggesting the exclusion of all except those with a "critical reference to previous positions." This, of course, points for the origin of these texts, not to the itinerant poet, if he existed, but to the temple ?lite. The question of the relationship between the development of the "theology of will" and the official temple cult requires a more open ended research strategy than is employed in this work. But whatever objections one may have to some of the author's more far-reaching conclusions, the work remains as yet another example of Jan Assmann's masterly command of the textual material of ancient Egypt, add ing yet another stimulating perspective to the question of the interaction between the concepts of polytheism and monotheism. Finally, Geoffrey T. Martin, the editor of the series Studies in Egyptology, is to be congratulated for the choice of this work for translation and, also, for the choice of translator, Anthony Alcock. The depth and complexity of the work of this author do not facilitate its accessibility. It is evident that the translator has devoted great effort to what has become a largely suc cessful transformation of the original. It is unfortunate, however, that a few disruptive errors have crept into the preparation of the text for publication. A few such examples will suffice. The heading on p. 51, "2. The Triumph over Apophis," should have been italicized to avoid confusion as to the structure of the text. A cutoff sentence ends p. 128. The table, lacking in the German edition, occurring on p. 146 in the largely reworked section on the Ba and the Life God, reads under the heading "Second Pentad," as a combination of symbol, class, and name: lion, quadraped, and falcon. The text indicates that the lion-headed ba of quadraped is called "ram of the rams" and not, as in the table, "falcon." And on p. 208 one of Assmann's somewhat notorious diagrams, illustrating the distinction between the indirect causation of the older concept and the direct causation of the new, lacks the guidelines necessary to make it com prehensible (cf. the German edition, p. 284). Given, however, the complexity of the text, these errors are of only minor importance. Much more important are the contributions made by the author in his return to his text, by the translator for the English costume</page><page sequence="11">Book Review 163 it has been given, and by the editor for making it accessible to a larger audience.
