<plain_text><page sequence="1">309 PERSPECTIVES IN POLYNESIAN RELIGION By E. S. Craighill Handy. E first volume of an interpretative history of Polynesian Religion, which more than any other I should like to write, for it would be the key to its psychic lore, its myths, its art and its ritual?a volume, in fact, without which no one will ever reconstruct a clear and true picture of the old worship?this first volume is one which will never be written by anyone. It would be entitled " A Record of Dreams of Polynesian Chiefs, Priests, Seers, Doctors, Warriors, Crafts men, Planters and Fishers, Bards and Dancers, Voyagers, Fathers and Mothers, Lovers and Haters, before 1800 a.d." When the Hawaiian Kepelino, in his Moolelo,1 penned the following simple statement, he said far more than he realized. "Dreams, (na moe uhane) were things seen by the spirit (uhane). They were called revelations (he mea a i ike ia, 'a thing seen') to the spirit and their name was 'doings of the night' (na hana o kapo), or another, the ' great night that provides' (ka po nui hoolakolako) . . . The 'doings of the night ' held an important place in the thought of old Hawaii . . . and these things were called ' the doings [hana, work, activities] of the aumakua [ancestral spirits] of the night' " (Kepelino, p. 114). The " things seen by the spirit," by all dreamers, and by seers in clairvoyant shifts of vision or in trance or coma, 1 " Kepelino's Traditions of Hawaii," Martha W.

The " doings of the night " in the quotation above means specifically what transpires during sleep. But it implies far more, for the Polynesians extended the applications of " night" (po) to mean: (1) the " other world " of spirits of the dead and the realm of gods, who were all directly or indirectly ancestral ; and (2) a primordial condition before the origination of the world and its forms, animate and inanimate, when the " World of Light or Day " (Ao Malwma lama) became manifest. Dreaming was an art in old Polynesia. In Hawaii, " premeditated99 dreaming was an essential part of the practice of their arts by expert craftsmen, healers, dancing masters and poets, planters and fishers. In the Marquesas, the tribal seers communed with their gods by sleeping at night with the head lying on the trunk of a coconut-tree near the place consecrated to the deified chief or priest who was the tribal god. Out of the person and life of the individual as dreamer or seer the religion emerges. The Self as subject, in sub conscious and conscious adjustments to external environ ment (physical and social), creates belief and practice by processes of fantasy, sentiment, reason, and intuition. Dreams and fantasy, extremely active in the sensitive, imaginative Polynesian self, underlie the belief in the existence of the separable soul. The ghost or wraith, as visible non-physical soul, is universal. The spirit-lore involving ancestors, nature-spirits, and demons is an elabora tion of the soul-ghost idea through the psychological pro cesses mentioned above, strengthened by tradition and the interaction of thought in group-life. Lands beneath the earth, to the westward, and in the heavens, inhabited by souls of the dead and deities are thought of with geographical precision characteristic of a voyaging race, the knowledge of their nature being in many instances attributed to visits of persons whose souls after reaching these lands returned to the body on earth. Reincarnation of souls is not Poly nesian ; but ideas of metempsychosis are widespread, though</page><page sequence="3">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 311 not standardized. Prestige, rites, and circumstances affecting death determine destiny in after-life. Ethical considerations are secondary and indirect factors. The soul-idea, projected and elaborated in terms of the social and physical phenomena encompassing the self, pro duces the active cult of the family and the community and the rationalized imaginative lore of the religion. The complication and elaboration of cult and lore appear to bear direct relation to size and density of contiguous population of ethnic area and group. The simplicity of Pukapuka and the complexity of the Society islands are attributable, pre sumably, to these factors rather than to any difference in heritage or endowment. Dream-experiences are presumably the source of most ideas of the nature of the " other world." There is even today living on the island of Maui in the Hawaiian islands a family who await their salvation when the " Hidden Land of Kane," seen by a dreamer and identified with towering masses of cumulous clouds seen over the ocean to eastward, shall roll up to the shore and transport them to eternal happiness in an Elysium of idyllic Hawaiian life. Another source is " second sight." Clairvoyance induced by gazing upon a still, shining liquid surface enabled Marquesan seers to see into the spirit-world. A condition of coma in some instances may account for vivid impressions and stories. Both in Tahiti and Hawaii I have met with remembered instances in recent times of persons who after " lying dead " for days " returned to the body " to tell what had been experienced and seen. The native lore is rich in stories recounting the adventures of persons who gained access to the other worlds and returned.2 Other concepts arise more directly, perhaps, in " wish fulfilment " and rationalization. We can understand how the Maoris, remembering their migration from the father land Hawaiki, picture the land of ancestors, and hence the 2 Te Rangi Hiroa (Peter H. Buck) : " Ethnology of Mangareva."

Other rationalizations are complex fabrications woven out of traditional lore by the imaginations of bards and priests: series of under-worlds and over-worlds, purgatories and paradises, inhabited by demons, gods, and spirits. The conception of soul, in the drama of family life and continuity, finds expression in what is generally called Ancestor Worship, which in Polynesia might better be termed Veneration of Forbears and Progeny, since the wel fare of the living and making the future secure for posterity interested the practical-minded folk of pre-Christian days more than salvation in the world to come. Concern with the well-being of the departed we do find, but the greater interest, even in the worship of Forbears, lies in what they are believed to be able to do for the living ; and we find also the motive of fear of offending by negligence in matters social and ritualistic. In considering family rituals, it is necessary first to view the religion from the angle of lineage, which is the very foundation of both the social and religious systems of all Polynesian peoples. In successive generations, each person is a link in the Forbear-Progeny chain: but it is the First Born in each branch of a lineage that is the primary link, frequently referred to as the Mua, the First. Genealogies are, socially, historic, and ceremonial heirlooms; ritually, they are magical and religious formulae whose recital has binding power. Death of a First-born marks the entry into the company of Grandfathers (Tupuna) of the ranking member of a generation on the genealogical ladder. Birth of a First-born marks the appearance of the ranking member of a new generation. To a varying degree, depending on how much sex affects sanctity in different localities, male first-borns are honoured more than female: father's and mother's lineages bear equal weight, but sex disqualifies a female in many ways ritualistically.</page><page sequence="5">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 313 In discussing religion of the family-group, the word family is used as signifying both household and the extended family, including relatives by blood, marriage, and adoption. Of the family rites celebrating the critical events in the life of individuals, the two of paramount importance in this Forbear-Progeny cult are the Birth rites and the Death rites. The religious aspects of these are quite simple : it is their social aspects that are elaborated. These social con comitants, involving obligations and rights extending through all the ramifications of relationship and status, gift giving, eulogies, feasting and dancing, are properly the province of the sociologist. On the religious side, ritual associated with both birth and death has as its purpose, first, safe-guarding the soul of the person affected, and, second, safeguarding the souls of the family involved. The safe guarding of the individual is accomplished by ritual com bining worship (prayer and offerings) and magic (potent acts, objects, etc.) designed (1) to purify, and to drive away evil spirits or impersonal evil influence; (2) to endow with desirable qualities and powers with the aid of good spiritual agencies. In every part of Polynesia, Birth and Death are occasions not of single rites just following the event, but of a sequence of rites over a considerable period. At the time of a birth the Maori, for instance, performs successive rites: (1) to aid delivery; (2) to endow the new-born infant with vitality ; (3) to purify it ; (4) to release it from tapu when the navel-string is removed; (5) to name it. Series of death-rites in the Marquesas are designed to placate the spirit by violent mourning, eulogy, gifts, dancing and feasting ; to empower it by chanting ; to speed it on its way and enable it to enter the underworld by presenting the proper gifts ; other rites have to do with embalming the body, purifying the embalmers, and finally disposing of the remains ; and long after, when quantities of provisions and goods have been accumulated, a feast or festival whose size is determined by the wealth of the family, elevates the status of the spirit in the other world and the prestige of the family on earth. Puberty-rites are of minor importance in Polynesia, which is curious in view of the importance of procreation and the understanding of its physical aspects-. Marriage is</page><page sequence="6">314 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY ritualized only where the prestige of chiefhood utilizes the occasion for political and social and economic ends. Incidental rites having to do with a boy's transfer to the men's eating house, with subincision, with tattooing, and with sickness, are many and varied. Typical of Polynesia are rites and feasts consecrating a new home, in the process of its fabrication, upon its com pletion, and when the household establishes itself in it. Household shrines are typical of some localities; but generally it is the grave or tomb of ancestors. Erect stones or posts symbolize ancestral spirits and serve frequently as back-rests or seats. Relics of the dead, especially skeletal and particularly skulls, are venerated, in all except West Polynesia serving as active ritual objects. In recent studies of the extended family in Hawaii much new light has come to me on the role of persons, more commonly female, whom we may term psychic-sensitives. One prone to vivid dreaming at times of sickness or other personal or family crises; one subject to that peculiar shifting of visual or auditory perception which we speak of as clairvoyance or clairaudience (but know very little about) ; one affected with or capable of what psychologists term " dissociation of personality " or " multiple personality," which spiritualists call " mediumship," i.e., coma or frenzy followed by speech in a voice alien to the person " possessed " (by a spirit), and acts seemingly induced by another personality; such a one will come to be regarded by the household, and eventually by relatives and the community, as a channel for communication with the spirits of the departed, with demons, or gods. A family medium in Hawaii appears always to become the servant or tender (kahu) of a particular deceased relative or spirit-entity of legendary or mythical fame; commonly the dreamer receives messages habitually from a particular person of the " Night (world) " (Po); the clairvoyant or clairaudient sees or hears a particular deceased relative or spirit or god. Mediumship, at first spontaneous, becomes formally dramatized and ritualized: with chanter to arrange the mat for the sitter and gifts for the spirit, and to invoke the spirit by chanting.</page><page sequence="7">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 315 The whole situation today is, I am convinced, not a revival in new garb but the perpetuation of an old function of psychic sensitive in the role of family spirit intermediary. Here lies the key, then, to that all-important figure in the community cults whom I termed " the Prophet " in my " Polynesian Religion " : earlier writers called them " Oracles " : either term is correctly applied, though " spirit medium " is probably better than either, being simpler, and descriptive. The tau(a of a Marquesan tribe in his tall house on the temple platform, speaking with the voice of the tribal ancestral god (frequently a deceased tau'a or chief), the taura in the Tahitian temple, the Hawaiian kaula speaking from his " oracle tower" on a low platform at the end of the temple-enclosure, the medium of village or island god of Samoa and Tonga, the Maori tribal or village medium. Communities in Polynesia are simply collections of families. Villages in Samoa or New Zealand are groups of households in which lineages intertwine. Marquesan or Maori tribes are complex agglomerations of lineages ex panded out of family-groupings. Nations, in the Society islands and Hawaii, are compound tribes organized under ruling family-dynasties. The patterning of family-worship is extended into group-worship. Some of the communal festivities of villages, tribes, and nations are the celebration of events in the life cycle of the First-born of the community, viz., the First-born of the ranking chief. Birth, marriage, and death of ranking chiefs are occasions when the whole community is united in ceremonial and festivity that is essentially a magnification of corresponding times in family life. The magnified festivities in turn reflect their outlines and glamour on the private festivities of families, so that where dynasties glorify these rites, as in Tahiti, we find imitation on a less lavish scale in lower orders of society. The death of the Chief marks the passage into the other world of a soul whose power and prestige calls for universal mourning and veneration. The rites of passage involve elaborations of offerings, sacrifice, eulogy, culminating in many sections in deification-rites, so that the soul of the communal forbear becomes a god.</page><page sequence="8">316 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Marriage becomes of prime ceremonial importance only in those islands where chiefly families established them selves as ruling dynasties, for there the union of First-borns, properly mated in accordance with genealogical prestige, is the means of perpetuating precedence, and, according to native ideas, affects the well-being of the whole populace, since the First-born-chief is a spiritual medium between the gods, the people, and the land. The community shrine, which under the dynasties becomes a temple, is the counterpart of the family shrine, and it is directly or indirectly an appurtenance of the chief and his family. Chief's tombs and their remains are venerated by all their people, and in most of the islands play their part in ritual affecting community-enterprise. Skeletal remains of chiefs are everywhere venerated, and in most sections are actively worshipped or used magically. Ritual leadership is limited to men, except for the socio-ceremonial role of the village Sacred Maid in western Polynesia and ritualistic functions of a female elder or of chief esses, in some localities. Genealogical (chiefly) or sacramental (priestly ) status determines religious function in the community. Age also affects role: children (except the First-born) have no communal status; young people are mere actors in work, singing, and dancing, while male elders as a body frequently constitute a sacredotal corps responsible for and active in communal rites. One of the most interesting features in the religion is the role of the Sacred Chief, who in the Polynesian socio religious system is : ( 1 ) the First-born in the line of genea logical seniority, and as such, (2) the revered and beloved Head of village, tribe or nation ; (3) whose soul, linking men with gods, is the sacred vehicle and transmitter of spiritual energy; (4) whose loins, by reason of his role, are sacred and symbolic in relationship to procreation as affecting both men and nature; (5) and whose person and all associated with it?name, dress, insignia, and accoutrements, house, canoe, and relatives?is as sacred as if he is a god: in Hawaii he was called akua, god. The sanctity and power of the chief, while deriving from his lineage (theoretically he is the First-born of First-borns in direct line from the</page><page sequence="9">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 317 mythological original Progenitor of his lineage), is increased by rituals adapted to this purpose at birth, marriage, installa tion as ruler; and at death the soul is made a god in the next world. In all its ramifications, the figure of the Sacred Chief in the drama of communal life, in religion and society, is seen as but an extension of the role of the First-born in household and lingeage group. The two Polynesian concepts best known in the study of religions, namely mana and tapu, are epitomized in the Sacred Chief. Both are essentially social expressions of conceptions having their origin in religious ideas. "Spiritual potency" appears to me the best simple definition of mana. The Sacred Chief has mana supremely; priests, doctors, craftsmen, fishermen, and planters have it to the degree their skill and success exhibit it, and these result in part from native endowment and capacity (thought to be largely heredity), in part from prayer and magic, but particularly depend upon favour of spirit-guardians. Objects acquire it through use and prowess (a weapon, a tool), through sanctification (an image), by reason of contact with sacred activities, persons, or things, or perhaps by reason of colour, name, or from suggestive of relationship with a spirit or god. Persons, things, and places that are either sacred or psychically corrupt (all associated directly or indirectly with death or women's menses) are tapu or interdicted. Tapu in Polynesia became universal customary law, a co-ordinated, logical, and completely integrated system governing indivi duals, classes, and functional groups, places, things, times, and circumstances. The mechanics of ritual follow precisely the patterns of social behaviour. An offering is a gift to attract, please, and coerce gods or spirits. The principles of worship and magic fuse in most Polynesian prayer-spells. Prayer-spells become antiphonal and choral chants in the more elaborated island cults. The gift and the words call for a visible medium of the god. When the god is in a person?the chief or a spirit medium?that person is recipient and addressee. Images appear actually to have been substitutes for a person, to represent the god, and it is not unlikely that this was the</page><page sequence="10">318 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY origin of image-worship. But the image becomes a symbol in a way the person cannot: the Marquesan images are definitely phallic symbols, as is appropriate in a cult in which the Progenitor is primarily thought of as procreator. Whale's teeth and erect stones are also phallic symbols. In Tahiti the war-god Oro, whose priests enmeshed the enemy's soul by reciting spells over the first captive foe, is represented by an intricately-plaited sennit-casing (suggestive of the enmeshing bags of Marquesan witches) ornamented with red feathers, upon a short stick (perhaps related to Maori stick-symbols of gods with sennet lashings, and to the stick of black wood in a packet of cloth, in one form of Hawaiian witchcraft). Other symbols are adzes, fish-hooks, clubs, bowls, red feathers, etc., associated through mythology or tradition with the spirit invoked. Animal forms, and to a less degree vegetable and inanimate forms, are associated with particular deities, as " bodies of the god " (i.e., form or appearance). One god might have a variety of forms, which are sacred, give omens, but generally are not worshipped as cult-objects. Dancing, in its religious uses, serves to attract, enter tain, excite, and stimulate the god honoured, exactly as it affects human witnesses. But there are subtler conceptions involved in posturing and gesturing such as that in the Hawaiian hula, which is procreative magic designed to stimu late fertility in nature and in men; and in the war-dances like the Maori haka which inspirited the dancers and dis spirited the enemy. Last, but centainly not least, in the ritualism that reflects social life, is feasting. Every occasion in social affairs of Polynesians is signalized by a feast. Equally, every religious ceremonial of any importance culminates in a feast, whose festivity reached lavish proportions in tribal and national celebrations commensurate with the size of the community, the abundance of nature and the energy and exuberance of the people. Polynesian religion shows most clearly how erroneous is the old-fashioned conception of religion, which views Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Mohammedan ism as the " Ethical Religions," and classifies all others under various categories, all academically " non-ethical," and from</page><page sequence="11">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 319 Christian and Victorian points of view, certainly unethical. Social ethics is the very core of the old institutionalized Polynesian cult. Malice, evil thought, and evil speech toward relatives is one of the commonest causes of sickness, and hence appears the interesting phenomenon of confession as prerequisite to healing. A second source of trouble is dis respect for customary law as exemplified in tapu: tapu breakers are summarily afflicted by spirits and gods with illness or accident in retribution for their misdemeanours. Sin against Posterity or Progenitors is similarly automatic ally punished: souls of infants aborted or killed at birth, and of relatives neglected at death, become ghouls that haunt the sinning survivors. Men who have intercourse with women during their defilement, and persons who in a state of defilement touch sacred things, or men who disregard the sanctity of the head, or anyone who disrespects animal incarnations as embodiments of family or tribal gods, is affected. Failure to fulfil obligations is a source of trouble : the offering of first fruits, the tribute owed to the chief, or the fulfilment of a duty or a promise to a relative. The ethics of work, viz. accuracy of execution, also dominate both social and religious ethics. The Polynesian word for fault or sin, hara, really means an error in the sense of a slip of the tongue or a false stroke with an adze. When a priest recites his prayer or spell, an error either in word or rhythmical recital negatives the effectiveness of his work. A Marquesan bard is believed to suffer psychic death if defeated or proven in error in an inter-tribal contest of wits, while his fellow-tribesman who is an adept in carving will throw away a carving marred by a slip of his tool, for such a slip is a sign of " eye-night," i.e., psychic blindness, indicating some evil due to sin on his part or in his family negativing his mana and foreboding trouble. It seems likely that a " slip " in social behaviour?such as cursing a relative, committing incest, violating a sacred place?in the mind of this race of craftsmen is placed in the same category as " error " in the sense of inaccuracy of execution. As the extension of the worship into the community-life is determined by the nature of that life, which itself is but</page><page sequence="12">320 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY an elaboration of the family scene, so, in the working life of the people another extension exists, conditioned by the circumstances of the work. In planting, the things planted are regarded as having soul and personality. A vegetable or a tree is a descendant of some ancestral Progenitor exactly as is man, in some cases having the same progenitor as man, e.g., taro and man in Hawaii. The Hawaiian planter therefore has to present his first taro to Kane as progenitor of taro, his first sweet potato to Kamapua'a (=Lono). Out of such simple presenta tions arise the elaborate First-Fruits festivals of Tahiti and the great pageant of the New Year (Makahiki) in Hawaii, in which the Supreme Chief receives tribute from all the land in the name of Lono. The culture of the plant affects directly the conception of the progenitor: to the taro's dependence on flowing fresh water may be attributed the poetic characterization of Kane as Kane-of-the-water-of-life. The sweet-potato, cultivated in dry localities and dependent on periodic rain, is responsible for Lono's being in Hawaii the rain-god, visible in cloud-formation. In turn, the god's nature affects the plant-culture : Kane, meaning " male," is god of taro, and consequently men only may cultivate this plant. Seasons and cycles of growth and maturing govern the ceremonial cycle of rituals: planting, first leafing, first fruiting, and harvest are analogous to the stages in the life-cycle of man, and are marked with appropriate rituals to establish rapport with the progenitor, to safeguard and to strengthen the plant. In these simple rituals we see the prototypes of the seasonal festivals in the communal cults. The old planters timed their horticultural cycle by the stars, in particular by the appearance and disappearance of the Pleiades, and even today believe implicitly in the control of moon-phases over plant-growth. Less is known of the esoteric side of fishing than of planting. In Hawaii, fishermen have local shark-patrons believed to be incarnations of deceased relatives; and they also use lucky stones, identified through dreaming with the spirits of particular species of fish. Carved stone fish-gods are typical of the Marquesas. In both Hawaii and the Marquesas, we find shrines near the shore dedicated to fish gods, where the first fish caught are offered. In the</page><page sequence="13">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 321 Marquesas, Tana'oa is god of ocean, and we found that the fishermen of one section had a special shrine dedicated to him. The same is true of Ta'aroa in one locality in Tahiti. In Maori mythology, Tangaroa is lord-of-ocean, and from him are descended all fish and reptiles. Enterprises involving groups of fishermen and boats and nets are typically en compassed with tapu, consecrational rituals including puri fication, offerings and prayer-spells to induce success in the work, comparable to the ritual of war. In warfare is seen communal enterprise involving the whole tribe or nation. Man-hunting, contest, and capture, appear to have been thought of by these seafaring folk as analogous to fishing : thus in Tahiti, the first captive is the " fish of Tu " (war god) ; in New Zealand is found the same figure of speech, while in the Marquesas we find the body of the slain foe slung up in a tree on a great fish-hook by the warriors who call themselves the tribe of Tu. The first of a catch of fish is sometimes offered by being slung up in a tree. War, as the sport of chiefs and as life-and-death work and adventure for the tribe, bristles with rituals, running the gamut from black-magic to superceremonial. In Hawaii, we find the war-lord, Ku, worshipped in the greatest temples where he is served by a special order of hereditary priest hood with a ritual (culminating in human sacrifice) whose rigours are described by David Malo, the native historian, as " accomplished only with fatigue and redness of the eyes." The most highly ritualized of all forms of peaceful industry is the art of canoe-building. Expert shipwrights are organized in guilds in some localities under the patronage of traditional founders of the art. The adze, the tool of the craft, becomes the sacred symbol of the forest-god Tane; and the toki-mana or adze with magic power occurs in many chants and legends. The ceremonial aspects of the work involve prayers and offerings when the tree is felled, consecration of the shed in which the work is done, of the tools, and of the workers. Upon completion of the craft, prayers and offerings remove the tapu ere she is launched, garlanded for her first taste of salt spray, amidst chanting, feasting, and dancing. A great canoe, in Polynesian thinking, is a person with a soul, represented in some localities by a conventionalized figure carved at the prow.</page><page sequence="14">322 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Ceremonial relating to housebuilding varies so greatly that it is difficult to summarize briefly. It will suffice to describe several aspects of Marquesan housebuilding as indicative of the application of Polynesian principles to this important work. One of the many ways of honouring the first-born son is the erection of a new home. Male relatives consecrated for the work, directed by a master-builder (Tuhuna), collect the materials and build the house. The important ritualistic element during the erection is the consecration of all materials utilized, by the chanting (by the tribal priest) of a creation-chant which commences with a description of the origin of the land and then summons to the family gathering the personifications or gods of each type of stone and wood utilized in construction. These progenitors of materials are the offspring of the Sky-father. Presum ably they were believed to share in the feasts that marked the commencement and completion of the work. When the family takes up residence, the same chant is again intoned by the priest standing upon its stone terrace, with the eldest member of the family and a paternal aunt of the child standing by holding leaves of a sacred fern. This removes the tapu, and a feast follows. The final rite is the tying, during the first night of occupancy, of a strip of cloth over the bed-space, termed the " loin-cloth " of the house, while a chant composed in honour of the First-born is intoned by the family. We have seen that every form of group-enterprise had its rituals. Practically every form had its experts or masters known as tohunga. There remains to be considered what is from the point of view of religion the most important form of consecrated labour, namely ritual leadership. In view of the term applied to them, in consideration of their training and fellowship, we must regard the experts in ritual (tohunga) as master-craftsmen in the art and work of priest craft, for so the Polynesians classify them. The Hawaiian priest is kahwm-puley the Tahitian tahu'a-pure, the Marquesan tuhuna-pu'e: Master-pray-er. This role involves mastery of the lore of ritual, hence we find a conjunction of priest and bard, and so the master-lorists are sometimes called rongo-rongo or 'ono-'ono, reciters or resounders (all recital being intoned or chanted). This is a masculine</page><page sequence="15">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 323 function, and the sacredness of such a Master approaches that of the chief as god-born, and the Spirit-medium as the vessel of the living deity. Thus the patterning of priestcraft exemplifies again that of communal enterprise, which is a ramification of the cult of Forebears in group activity. To turn now to mythology in the light of our general theme of the reflection of native life in the religion, we find in the lore not only the anthropomorphic and socio-morphic archetypes in projection, but also imagery based on the plants and animals known in the island world. In creation chants there are in New Zealand and elsewhere terms that connote ideas of the earth as growing like a tree or plant. Quite generally, islands figure as fish, in origin, hooked up out of ocean by the culture hero Maui ; or politically in the Society islands conquered as great fish are caught, and divided up as they are carved. New Zealand is the " fish " of Maui ; " Tahiti-the-Fish " is the characterization of the island in the chants recording its conquest by the Ta'aroa chieftains. The octopus becomes both a ritualistic and geographic symbol. Ta'aroa as creator in Tahiti emerges from a cosmic egg floating in space, as a feathered creature. This bird-theme in myth and cult is perhaps the most wide spread, and still the least understood, element in Polynesian symbology, occuring as the "Sacred Red Bird" (numu-kura), the Bird of Tane, etc. ; seen in the role of red feathers in ceremonialism ; in the well-known bird-cult of Easter island ; and in the role played in myth and ritual by Rupe, the pigeon. We have seen how Tane, Tangaroa, Rongo, and Tu appear in roles in relation to planting, fishing, craf tsmanship and war. With considerable fidelity to function in the cult and role in mythology, these four figures, with one goddess, Hina the Moon, stand out as the Great Forebears throughout Polynesia, although Tane, Rongo, and Tu tend to fade out in the west. There planting is not systematized as in the regions where Rongo is venerated ; and, furthermore, it is unnecessary to pray for rain in Tonga and Samoa. Tiki tiki is there, perhaps supplanting Tane, of whom he was originally an attribute. Also in the west, where village life came to dominate the cultural scene, village war-gods are all important, eclipsing Tu, of early Polynesian fame.</page><page sequence="16">324 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY I concur with Dr. Buck in thinking that each of these major gods, like the eponymous tribal deities of more recent origin, were actually ancestral in the early period of Poly nesian settlement, and that they became first legendary, and later mythical. In central Polynesia tradition preserves the memory of this in references to Ati Tu (Tribe of Tu), Ati Tane, Ati Kongo; and in the Society islands the ruling dynasty of chiefs term themselves the Hui Ari'i a Ta'aroa, the Group of Tangaroa Chiefs. The Maori lore preserves the clearest picture of mythical teachings, and probably is closer than any other to an older " original Polynesian," that is, the mythology as of the era of dispersion dating between the tenth and fourteenth centuries A.D. In this lore is seen quite simply what has already been stressed repeatedly, the projection of the human individual and social ideology upon the scene and drama of nature and cosmos. As in coitus, Earth lies prone in the embrace of Sky. Their progeny, the greater gods, mentioned in the paragraph above, and others, are born, in their turn becoming progenitors of the various phenomena of nature : Tane of the land, its human folk, its rocks, its forests and the denizens of the forest, balanced by Tangaroa as lord of ocean, whose descendants are the fishes and octopus and reptiles, and also the feathered creatures, anciently, I suspect, in view of Tahitian, Marquesan, and Samoan creation-chants associating Tangaroa with bird-myths. Rongo, patron of peaceful arts, taking refuge in earth when war rages between the sons of heaven over his separation by Tane from earth, and Tu-with-eyes-of-rage as war lord, are really secondary to Tane and Tangaroa as elemental deities, since they are distinctly patrons of the arts of man. In consonance with our theme of the creation of the religion by projection, the figure of Tiki deserves especial notice. Peculiar sanctity is attributed to the loins of First borns by the Polynesians, as is exemplified in the loin-cloth's emblematic and actual uses as a medium of mana; in magical chants incorporating direct and figurative reference to the chief's genitals ; and in acts denoting the figurative concep tion of these as ceremonially potent. It has been shown by Elsdon Best and myself, respectively in New Zealand and the Marquesas, that Tiki (whose name means image, symbol,</page><page sequence="17">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 325 representation) is specifically, in myth and art, a figurative persoriification of Tane's (tane means male) organ of genera tion. In the cult of Progenitors in the Marquesas (and pre sumably elsewhere) there is a conjunction or fusion of this conception and theme with the representation of ancestral spirits by conventionally carved erect cylindrical figures in wood ?nd stone: the tiki (image) at one and the same time depicts the human being with conventionalized features, and is a phallus. This development is precisely paralleled in the Unga of the ancient Deva Raja cult of south India, Indo-China and Indonesia, in which kings, regarding themselves as in carnations of Shiva as Procreator, had their portraits carved in conventional form upon the Unga set up in their memorial shrinks. Linga has the same meaning as tiki : mark, token, sign, ?mblem, phallus, image of a god. This brings us to one element in Polynesian mythology that 1 find it impossible to derive by simple, normal processes of setitiment, reason or intuition out of individual psychic experience or local socio-historic processes. It is arguable that there is no reason why Polynesians as well as others may not have arrived at these ideas through their own reasoning. It is also arguable, in view of the fact that this particular theme is peculiar to and fundamental in Hindu religious philosophy prevailing in the region from which the Polynesians must have migrated during the period of their migration, that this theme was not originated in the Pacific but was brought with the colonizers as part of their heritage of lore by priests accompanying some exploring parties that became early Polynesian colonists. The theme I refer to is the idea of the evolution of nature in successive eras out of cosmos conceived as dualistic. This is exemplified most clearly in the remarkable Kumulipo chant of origins in Hawaii, and in the teachings of the Whare-wananga in New Zealand.3 Evolution in successive eras, proceeding within and by means of a dualistic cosmic scheme is the principle of the Sankhya theory of origins in India, which was elaborated into the historical theological works as Puranas, 3 Liliuokalani, An Account of the Creation of the World according to Hawaiian Tradition, Boston, 1897.

This literature is identified with the worship of Vishnu, one of the two great sects of Hinduism carried into Indonesia in the first millenium of our era. The cult of Io or Iho4 as Supreme Being in the teaching of the Whare-wananga also appears to me more likely to have been transported in the memories of priests from the land whence some of the colonists set sail for Polynesia, than to have originated in the Pacific in the minds and lore of these pioneering, rugged, war-loving tribesmen. In the Whare-wananga teaching, Io is the inner " core," unmani fest, but source of all: Tane is the manifest transmitter, who, symbolized as pjiallic Tiki, is divine Procreator. This parallels the teaching of the other great Hindu sect of Shiva worship that prevailed in Indonesia when the Polynesian forebears are suspected of having left the shores of some island in that region. That teaching is that Ishvara is the inner reality or manifestation of Shiva who is represented by the Unga or phallus as manifest symbol. 4 Io was revealed first in New Zealand. There Io is the name, secretly guarded by th? priesthood and known only to initiates, of the Primal Entity. The name has recently been identified as Kiho in the Tuamotus, and as Io in Hawaii. At present no overt reference has been found in Marquesan teachings; but the priestly lore of those islands, some of which has been recorded, has not yet been analyzed. There is no evidence whatever of this concept in the West ; and only fragmentary reference in the Society islands. In Hawaii, it is not known, and probably never will be known, whether Io was a universal esoteric teaching in the priesthood ; on the whole it appears to me now to be in the nature of a private aumakua (spirit guardian) sect or cult treasured within certain families with a secrecy characteristic of such psychic heritages. In the Tuamotus it is by no means certain where and how ethnologists will ultimately classify Kiho in relation to local and neighbouring sacred lore: much still remains to be said on the subject, and Tuamotuan lore is as yet by no means all recorded. There is no justification in the present state of our knowledge for placing Io in the role of Supreme Being at the head of a pan-Polynesian pantheon, as I did in my Polynesian Religion in 1927. Note by Editor : Readers of the foregoing note will not need to be reminded that the existence of the Kiho cult in the Tuamotus is seriously in question, and that several investigative papers on the subject by Kenneth P. Emory have recently been appearing in this Journal.</page><page sequence="19">Perspectives in Polynesian Religion 327 To trace the socio-religious system in its development out of the subjective into family-community expressions is logical, for Polynesian psychic experience was and is that of the Self in Polynesia, while socially their more complex groupings arose out of family archetypes since they colonized their isolated islands in small parties. But to attribute every thing in Polynesian religion to local psychic, social, and historic processes appears to be to be neither sensible nor reasonable. It is hardly likely that the Polynesian colonizers, coming from a region where advanced classical and medieval civilization prevailed, shook from their feet the cultural dust and lore of their homeland when they set sail, or that when they stepped upon the shores of their future Polynesian homes they were washed as clean of heritage and tradition as the decks of their good ships were of the refuse of the ports they had left. Evidence that some of their forebears may have been nurtured in a brilliant Indie civilization detracts not at all from the interest or credit due these Pacific pioneers, though it may conflict with picturesque sentiment which regards them as a neolithic people because they used stone tools in a region devoid of metal. The word neolithic sheds a romantic light of primordialism about them, but I question its being the light of reason. Their stone tools were neolithic, but was their complex mentality?5 5 In the forthcoming memorial volume honouring Professor Roland B. Dixon, my paper on Marquesan rock-carvings presents definite evidence that certain of these carvings are crude characters of a Javanese script belonging to the late period when Hinduism was the state religion, prior to the Mohammedan conquest.</page></plain_text>
