Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at the Royal Anthropological Institute, 21, Bedford Square, London, W.C.I., on Monday, November 4th, 1946, at 8 p.m. I.-TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. By R. B. BRAITHWAITE. IF I had met a friend on the train from Cambridge this afternoon and he had asked me why I was travelling to London, I should have replied " In order to give an address to the Aristotelian Society ". In giving this reply I should have answered his " Why" question with an explanation in terms of the end to be attained by my action in travelling to London; that is, I should have given him a teleological explanation. If I am asked why my cat paws at the door on a particular occasion, I might well reply " In order that I should open the door for him "-another teleological explanation. If an ornithologist is asked why a cuckoo lays her egg in the nest of another bird, and replies " So that the other bird may hatch out and nurture her young ", or if a physiologist is asked why the heart beats, and replies " To circulate the blood round the body " or (in more detail) " To convey oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs " or (in terms of an ultimate biological end) " In order that the body may continue to live ", he will be giving in each case a teleo- logical explanation of the action in terms of the goai or end of the action. The explanation consists in stating a goal to be attained: it describes the action as one directed towards a certain goal-as a " goal-directed activity" (to use Dr. E. S. Russell,'s convenient phrase+)-the word " directed " being used (as I shall use it) to imply a direction but not to imply a director. * The Directiveness of Organic Activities (1945). a</page><page sequence="2">11 R. B. BRAITHWAITE. If we take an explanation (as I think we do) to be any answer to a " Why" question which in any way answers the question, and thereby gives some degree of intellectual satisfaction to the questioner, there can be no doubt that teleological answers of the sort of which I have given examples are genuine explanations. The fact that they all may give rise to further questions does not imply that they are not perfectly proper answers to the questions asked. My answer as to why I came up from Cambridge this after- noon would almost certainly not lead to a further quiestion, unless my friend wished to start a philosophical discussion as to the correct analysis of the motives of rational action. My answer as to why my cat paws the door might lead to the further question as to why the cat (to use common- sense language) " wants to be let out ", to which another teleological answer would be appropriate, or to the question as to how the cat has learnt to paw the door to show that he wants to be let out, which would lead to a description, which might or might not be in teleological terms, of the processes of learning in cats. But all these would be regarded as further and different questions: the first simple teleological answer would be taken as what the questioner was asking for, and if it did not give him adequate intellec- tual satisfaction, he would expect not to repeat the question but to ask another. But, having insisted that teleological explanations are perfectly good explanations, one has to admit that they have one feature which distinguish them from ordinary causal explanations, and that this feature has proved very puzzling to philosophers, whether concerned with philo- sophical psychology or with the philosophy of biology. In an ordinary causal explanation the explicandum is explained in terms of a cause which either precedes or is simultaneous with it: in a teleological explanation the explicandum is explained as being causally related either to a particular goal in the future or to a bio- logical end which is as much future as present or past. It is the reference in teleological explanations to states of affairs in the future, and often in the comparatively distant</page><page sequence="3">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. iii future, which has been a philosophical "problem" ever since Aristotle introduced the notion of " final cause"; and I should not have ventured to re-discuss it had I not felt that I had something to say which I had not found elsewhere, something to say, moreover, which might help to settle the controversy which rages continually among philosophers of biology and (to a less extent) among working biologists as to the legitimacy of teleological explanations in the biological sciences. Now there is one type of teleological explanation in which the reference to the future presents no difficulty, namely, explanations of an intentional human action in terms of a goal to the attainment of Nhich the action is a means. For my teleological answer to the question as to why I travelled up to-day-that I came up to address the Aristotelian Society-would be regarded by my questioner as equivalent to an answer that I came up because I intended to address the Aristotelian Society, my travelling being a means to fulfil that intention; and this answer would have been an explanation of the ordinary causal sort with my intention as cause preceding my journey as effect. Teleological explanations of intentional goal- directed activities are always understood as reducible to causal explanations with intentions as causes: to use the Aristotelian terms, the idea of the " final cause " functions as "efficient cause" the goal-directed behaviour is explained as goal-intended behaviour. I am not saying, of course, that there is no philosophical difficulty about intentional action; there is the problem- fundamental for philosophical psychology-as to the correct analysis of the intention to act in a certain way. But this is different from our problem as to how a future reference can occur in an explanation, unless indeed an extreme behaviouristic analysis is adopted, according to which there is no conscious element in an intention, and goal-intended behaviour is simply what we call goal-directed behaviour in the higher animals. But for this extreme behaviourism psychology reduces to biology, and intentional action falls under biological goal-directed activity and the type of a 2</page><page sequence="4">iv R. B. BRAITHWAITE. teleological explanation we meet in the sciences concerned with life in general and not especially with mind. The difficulty about the future reference occurs then in all teleological explanations which are not reducible to explanations in terms of a conscious intention to attain the goal. Here one cannot obviously reduce the teleological answer, which explains a present event by means of a future event, to a non-teleological answer in terms of a present or past cause. It is teleological explanations which cannot obviously be so reduced which present the philosophical problem ; and the rest of my paper will be devoted to this type of teleological explanations and to the problems raised by them. Now there are two ways of solving this problem which are fashionable to-day. Both are attempts to reduce all teleological explanations to ordinary causal explanations, and thus to eliminate the special puzzle presented by future reference ; but the attempts are made in opposite directions. The first way is to emphasise the similarity between teleological explanations of the type with which we are now concerned and the teleological explanations of intentional actions in which the future reference can be explained away, and to argue by analogy that in all cases the teleological explanation is reducible to one in which an intention or something analogous to an intention in the agent is the "efficient cause", so that goal-directed activity is always a sort of goal-intended activity. My cat's behaviour in pawing at the closed door, it may be said, is sufficiently similar to a man's behaviour in knocking at a locked door for it to be reasonable to infer that the cat, like the man, is acting as he does because of a conscious intention, or at least a conscious desire, to be let through the door. Similarly a neurotic's goal-directed behaviour may be explained by his having an unconscious intention or desire; a bird's nest-building by its having an instinct to do so. When the goal-directed activity to be explained is that of a part of a whole organism, as in my example of the heart's beating, the analogue to the intention-the drive or conatus or nisus or urge-is usually posited not in the separate</page><page sequence="5">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. V organ but in the organism as a whole-an urge towards self-preservation, for example. Sometimes the analogy is pressed so far that a purposiveness similar to that of voluntary action is assumed in all teleological behaviour. McDougall, after explaining that by " purposiveness " in human movements he means not only that " they are made for the sake of attaining their natural end " (i.e., that they are teleological in my sense), but that " this end is more or less clearly anticipated or foreseen",* goes on to speak of a " scale of degrees of purposiveness ", at the lower end of which there is a " vague anticipation of the goal " which may also be ascribed to an animal's goal-directed behaviour. Other writers (e.g., Dr. E. S. Russell) would reject as unduly anthropomorphic the attribution of purposiveness to such activities, and would describe the efficient cause as a conatus or drive. But all writers who deal with the problem of teleological explanation in the first way agree in postulating something in the organism which is present whenever goal-directed behaviour is taking place and which is to explain it in the ordinary causal way, and agree in supposing that this something cannot be analysed purely in physico-chemical terms. The biological orthodoxy of to-day, however, would say that the postulation of this " something ", not explicable in physico-chemical terms, to account for teleological behaviour was an assumption which was either methodo- logically vicious (if the " something " was supposed to have no properties other than those of being the cause of the goal-directed behaviour) or metaphysical and non-empirical (if it was supposed to have additional properties such as McDougall's purposiveness). And orthodox biologists would go on to say that satisfactory explanations had been given of many goal-directed activities in physico-chemical terms, and that as the new sciences of biochemistry and biophysics advance, there is less and less reason to suppose that there will be any teleological action (or at any rate any teleological action in which consciousness is not involved) * W. McDougall, Outline of Psychology (1923), pp. 47, 48.</page><page sequence="6">Vi R. B. BRAITHWAITE. that will not be explicable by means of the concepts and laws of chemistry and physics alone. This attitude is equivalent to an attempt to solve the problem of teleological explanations in a second way, by reducing them to physico-chemical explanations of the ordinary causal sort. It is admitted that biochemistry and biophysics at the moment cannot effect this reduction in the great majority of cases, but it is expected that some day they will be able to. Teleological explanations must be accepted as irreducible into ordinary causal explan- ations at present, but not as in principle irreducible. Thus the philosophical problem presented by the reference to the future in such explanations is a temporary problem only, to be solved by the progress of science. A teleological explanation is to be regarded as a very poor sort of explanation indeed, to be discarded as soon as the real, physico-chemical causes have been discovered. It seems to me that the orthodox biologists are right in rejecting the postulation of a non-physical conatus or drive to explain the goal-directed behaviour which they meet in their biological studies, but wrong in minimising the intellectual satisfaction to be derived from teleological explanations. I believe that we can go on the orthodox assumption that every biological event is physico-chemically determined, and yet find an important place in biology for such explanations. So what I propose to do is to try to give an account of the nature of teleological explanations which will resolve the philosophical difficulty about the apparent determination of the present by the future without either contravening the usual deterministic principles of science or reducing all biological laws to those of chemistry and physics. If we assume the ordinary deterministic principles of science, the apparent determination of the explicandum by a future event in a teleological explanation is not direct, but works by means of a causally connected chain of events between the explicandum and the goal. Even in intentional action the intention does not directly produce the goal: it starts a chain of action whose final stage is attainment</page><page sequence="7">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. Vii of the goal. In non-intentional goal-directed action the goal-directedness consists simply in the fact that the causal chain in the organism goes in the direction of the goal, unless one wishes to suppose that there is always an extra " something "-conatus or drive -involved in goal-directed- ness, an assumption which I do not wish to make. Thus the notion of causal chain is fundamental. Of course this notion is equally fundamental in the non-teleological explanations provided by the physical sciences, where the explaining cause is frequently given not as an event immediately preceding the explicandum but as a preceding event connected with the explicandum by a causal chain. Let us approach our problem, therefore, by asking what (if any) is the peculiarity of the causal chains which are involved in teleological explanations. Lord Russell, in the behaviouristic account of desire given in The Analysis of Mind, approaches our problem in the same way as I do in asserting that the peculiarity of teleological causal chains of actions is that they form " behaviour-cycles ". But the only criterion he gives to enable us to pick out the behaviour-cycles from other repeated series of events in the life of an animal is that the final stage in a behaviour-cycle is "normally a condition of temporary quiesence ". * He illustrates this by an animal falling asleep after it has eaten. But temporary quiescence is quite inadequate to serve as the differentia for which we are seeking. After a bomb has exploded, or a volcano ceased to erupt, a state of temporary quiescence is attained. Here no teleology is concerned in the causal chains. It seems impossible to find any characteristic of the final state by itself of a teleological causal chain which is general enough to cover all the goals of goal-directed actions and yet specific enough to differentiate such actions from other repeated cycles of behaviour. It is necessary, I think, to look at the whole causal chain and not merely at its final state. It seems to me that a distinguishing criterion can be found in one of the characteristics which biologists have * Bertrand Russell, The Analysis of Mind (1921), p. 65.</page><page sequence="8">Viii R. B. BRAITHWAMTE. emphasised in their descriptions of goal-directed behaviour, namely persistence towards the goal under varying conditions. To quote Dr. E. S. Russell: "Coming to a definite end or terminus is not per se distinctive of directive activity, for inorganic processes also move towards a natural terminus . . . . What is distinctive is the active persistence of directive activity towards its goal, the use of alternative means towards the same end, the achievement of results in the face of difficulties ". * Examples of this " plasticity " of goal-directed behaviour will spring to every mind. To give one example only, Lashley's rats who had learnt to obtain their food by running his maze were still able to traverse the maze without false turns in order to obtain food after their powers of motor co-ordination had been seriously reduced by cerebellar operations, so that they could no longer run but could only crawl or lunge. Plasticity is not in general a property of one teleological causal chain alone : it is a property of the organism with respect to a certain goal, namely that the organism can attain the same goal under different circumstances by alternative forms of activity making use frequently of different causal chains. Let me try to elucidate the logical and epistemological significance of this plasticity, in order to see whether it will serve my purpose of preserving the importance of teleological explanations without introducing extra-physical causation. Consider a chain of events in a system b. The system may be a physical system of more or less complexity (a pilotless plane or an electron) or it may be,an organic system (a complete organism or a relatively isolable part of a complete organism e.g., the kidneys). Make the ordinary deterministic assumption that every event in the system is causally determined by the whole previous state of the system together with the causally relevant factors in the system's environment or field (which will be called the " field-conditions "). Then the causal chain c of events in b throughout a period of time is determined by the initial state e of the system together with the totality * Op. cit. p. 144.</page><page sequence="9">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. ix of field-conditions which affect the system with respect to the events in question during the period. Call this set of field-conditions f. Then, for given system b with initial state e, c is a one-valued function off; i.e., for given b and e, the causal chain c is uniquely determined by f- the set of field-conditions. Now consider the property which a causal chain in a system may possess of ending in an event of type F without containing any other event of this type. Call this property the r-goal-attaining property, and the class of all causal chains having this property the r-goal-attaining class G. Every causal chain which is a member of G contains one and only one event of type r, and contains this as its final event. Define the variancy V with respect to a given system b with given initial state e, and to a given type of goal r, as the class of those sets of field-conditions which are such that every causal chain in b starting with e and determined by one of these sets is r-goal-attaining. To express this more shortly with the symbols already used, the variancy V is defined as the class of those f's which uniquely deter- mine those c's which are members of G. According to this definition, to say that a causal chain c in a system b starting from a state e ends (without having previously passed through) a state of type r is logically equivalent to saying that the set of field-conditions is a member of V. The variancy is thus (to repeat the definition in a looser form) the range of circumstances under which the system attains the goal. The variancy V defined in relation to b, e and r may have no members, in which case there is no causally possible chain in b starting from e and attaining a goal of type r. Or V may have one member, in which case there is exactly one such chain which is causally possible. Here the system starting from e has no plasticity ; there is only one set of field-conditions which, together with e, is causally sufficient for the attainment of a goal of type r. The case in which we are interested, in which the system has plasticity, occurs when the variancy V has more than</page><page sequence="10">X R. B. BRAITHWAITE. one member, so that the occurrence of any one of alternative sets of field-conditions is, together with e, sufficient for the attainment of a goal of type P. It is important to note that the variancy may have many members and yet there be only one causally possible chain: it is because the size of the variancy may be greater than the number of possible causal chains that the notion of the variancy has been intro- duced. For it may be the case that there are various sets of field-conditions each of which, together with e, determines exactly the same causal chain. This might happen if the ultimate causal laws concerned are such that each of the events in the chain might be determined by two or more alternative field-conditions. But it more frequently happens when the events in the chain are taken as being events which attribute properties to the system as a whole, and when, although alternative field-conditions determine different part-events in the system or in parts of the system, these part-events are causally so connected that the whole event determined by them remains un- changed. For example, if the causal chain of events with which we are concerned is the chain of body temperatures throughout a period of time of one of the higher animals, a change in the relevant environmental conditions (e.g. external temperature and available sources of food) will produce changes in the activities of the animal (both changes in its total behaviour, e.g., its feeding and migration habits, and changes in its parts, e.g,. its sweat glands), yet these changes wili be such as to compensate for the changed environmental conditions so that the animal's body temperature does not vary. Another example would be the path of a pilotless plane, in which the machine is fitted with ingenious devices so designed that the plane will maintain a straight course at the correct height to the desired goal irrespective of the weather conditions it may encounter. But usually when the variancy has more than one member, there is more than one causally possible chain in the system in question which attains the required goal. An animal can move to get its food in many ways, a great</page><page sequence="11">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. Xi variety of physiological processes can be called into play to repair damaged tissue, a bird can adapt its nest-building to the kind of material available. Nevertheless the essential feature, as I see it, about plasticity of behaviour is that the goal can be attained under a variety of circumstances, not that it can be attained by a variety of means. So it is the size of the variancy rather than the number of possible causal chains that is significant in analysing teleological explanation. Let us now take the standpoint of epistemological or inductive logic and consider what are the types of situation in which we reasonably infer that there will be a goal- attaining chain of events in a system. To predict that, starting from an initial state e of a system b, there will be a causal chain which will attain a goal of type r is, by the definition of variancy, equivalent to predicting that the set of field-conditions which will occur will be a member of the variancy V. So the reasonableness of the prediction depends upon the likelihood that V is large enough to contain every set of field-conditions that is at all likely to occur. Call the class of these sets of field-conditions U. For simplicity's sake I shall for the moment assume that we know that any set of field-conditions that will occur will be comprised in U; that is, that the system will not in fact encounter a very unlikely environment (e.g. the next Ice Age starting suddenly to-morrow). Then the reasonable- ness of the prediction that the system will attain the goal depends upon the reasonableness of believing that U is contained in V. Now there are two ways in which we may have derived our knowledge of the variancy V. We may have deduced V from knowledge of the relevant causal laws, or we may have inferred it inductively from knowledge of the sets of field-conditions under which similar causal chains had attained their goals in the past. In the first case, that in which the members of V have been obtained by deduction, there are two interesting sub-cases in which we take positive steps to secure that U-the class of the sets of field-conditions at all likely to occur-is included in the variancy V. The</page><page sequence="12">Xii R. B. BRAITHWAITE. first is that in which V is small, but we deliberately arrange that U shall be smaller still. This happens when scientific demonstrations are performed for students in a laboratory, when elaborate precautions are taken (e.g., the experiment is done in a vacuum or distilled water is used) in order to eliminate unwanted relevant causal factors (air-currents or chemical impurities) and thus to secure that every set of conditions that may occur will fall within the known variancy V so that the demonstration will be a success. The second sub-case is that in which U is large, but we deliberately arrange that V shall be larger still. This happens when a machine is deliberately designed to work under a large variety of conditions. This object may be achieved by using suitable materials: a motor-car is built to stand up to a lot of rough and careless treatment. Or it may be achieved by incorporating in the machine special self-regulating devices to ensure that the machine adjusts its method of working according to the conditions it encounters, as in the pilotless plane. When our knowledge of the relevant variancy is obtained by deduction from previous knowledge of the causal laws concerned, a teleological explanation of an event in terms of its goal-directedness is felt to be almost valueless. * For in this case, that the causal chain that will occur will lead to the goal-the " teleology " of the system-is calculated from its " mechanism ". To give a teleological answer to the " Why" question would require forming (and suppressing) an ordinary causal answer, which would (if expressed) have given intellectual satisfaction to the questioner, in order to deduce from it a teleological answer. This would be an unprofitable, and indeed disingenuous, way of answering his question. The situation is entirely different when our knowledge or reasonable belief about the variancy V has not been * In the case of a machine or of a laboratory demonstration a teleological explanation can of course be given of the action of a man in starting and controlling the machine or demonstration. Derivatively we can give a teleological explanation of the working of the machine itself. But these explanations are all in terms of intentions as efficient causes ; and the problems they raise are not included in the scope of this paper.</page><page sequence="13">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. Xlii derived from knowledge of causal laws. In this case our knowledge as to what sets of conditions make up the variancy has been obtained either directly by induction from previous experience of goal-attaining behaviour that was similar to the behaviour with which we are concerned, or indirectly by deduction from general teleological propo- sitions that have themselves been derived as inductions from past experience. Neither of these ways makes use of ordinary causal laws. The variancy V is inferred- probably inferred-from knowledge of classes similar to U; that is, from past observation of the conditions under which similar teleological behaviour has taken place. For example, my knowledge of the conditions under which a swallow will migrate is derived from knowledge about past migrations of swallows and of other migrants, fortified perhaps by general teleological principles which I accept about the external conditions for self-preservation or the survival of the species, themselves derived inductively from past experience. It is when our knowledge of the relevant variancy has been obtained independently of any knowledge of causal laws that a teleological explanation is valuable. For in this case we are unable, through ignorance of the causal laws concerned, to infer the future behaviour of the system from causal laws of the ordinary sort ; but we are able to make a probable inference as to its behaviour from knowledge of how similar systems have behaved in the past. It should be noted that in all cases of teleological explanation of a present event by a future event whether reducible or irreducible problematic inferences occur at two stages of the argument. One stage is in the inference of the variancy, whether this is obtained inductively, or deductively from causal laws or teleological generalisations which have themselves been established inductively. The other problematic stage in the inference is that the set of relevant conditions that will occur in fact in the future will fall within the variancy. Every teleological answer, how- ever reasonable, may be in error in each of these two ways. But, of course, as Bishop Butler said, " probability is</page><page sequence="14">Xiv R. B. BRAITHWAITE. the very guide of life" ; and irreducible teleological explanations are not in general less worthy of credence than ordinary causal explanations. A teleological explan- ation of a particular event is intellectually valuable if it cannot be deduced from known causal laws: other things being equal, it is the more valuable the wider the variancy of conditions, and hence the greater the plasticity of the behaviour concerned. It is because we are acquainted with systems-organisms and parts of organisms-which exhibit great plasticity that we make use of teleological explanations. Such an explanation may be regarded as merely another way of stating the fact of the plasticity of the goal-directed behaviour. But to state this fact is to bring the explicandum under a general category, and moreover it enables us to make predictions, with a reason- able degree of reliability, as to how the system will behave in the future. It seems ridiculous to deny the title of explanation to a statement which performs both of the functions characteristic of scientific explanations-of en- abling us to appreciate connexions and to predict the future. So far I have only discussed teleological explanations of particular events e.g., of why my cat paws the door on a particular occasion. But, just as particular causal explanations are instances of laws of nature, of more or less generality, so my particular teleological explanations are instances of teleological laws of nature of more or less generality ; that is, they are instances of laws according to which an event of a certain sort in a system of a certain sort is determined by a later event of a certain sort in the same system. Such a teleological law will be valuable as an explanation if it has not been deduced from non- teleological laws, and it will be the more valuable both intellectually and predictively the wider the range of the variancy associated with it. The special philosophical difficulty about teleological, as contrasted with ordinary causal, explanations of particular events-namely, that in them the present appears to be determined by the future-does not arise in the case of</page><page sequence="15">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. XV teleological as contrasted with non-teleological laws, con- sidered as laws of nature without regard to their applications to yield particular explanations. For many non-teleo- logical laws of nature, e.g., Newton's laws of mechanics, are symmetrical with respect to the earlier and later times occurring in the laws: they state that the present is determined by the future just as much as it is determined by the past. Nor do teleological laws in general differ from non-teleological ones in having a time-interval between the two related events: many non-teleological laws are about what happens during a period of time taken as a whole, e.g., the Law of Least Action. The difference between the two types of law seems to consist simply in the way in which the related variancy is discovered. At this point I think a comparison is worth making which, to my surprise, has not been made by philosophers or biologists with whose writings I am acquainted. This is the comparison with another type of law of a somewhat peculiar nature which occurs in psychology and in biology, and which shares with the teleological type the two characteristics that there is an interval of time between the determining and the determined event, and that the law holds under a wide variety of conditions which have been discovered inductively and not deductively. I refer to the laws governing what Lord Russell in The Analysis of Mind* called " mnemic phenomena ", laws which he called " mnemic laws ". The simplest example of such a law is that of memory recall, in which a present memory-image is determined (partially determined) by the occurrence in the rememberer of an experience of which the present memory- image is an image ; but there are plenty of non-psychological examples in biology. The Mendelian laws of heredity state that sometimes some of the present characteristics of an organism are determined very precisely by the characteristics of its parent or parents at the time when the reproduction process commenced. More frequently the Mendelian determination is only statistical. In all the mnemic laws an earlier event is said to determine a later * Op. cit. pp. 77 et seq.</page><page sequence="16">Xvi R. B. BRAITHWAITE. event without the intervening causal chain being specified or indeed known. We may postulate, if we wish, persistent genes to explain the facts of heredity, and traces in the brain or unconscious ideas in the mind to explain memory; but these are extra explanatory hypotheses going beyond what the mnemic law itself states. Or we may follow Lord Russell's suggestion of supposing that there is a type of causation (which he called " ultimate mnemic causation ") in which a past event directly determines a future event without there being any intermediate causal chain. To suppose this would be almost as alien to our usual ways of thinking as to suppose that the future goal directly determines the present goal-directed action ; and I agree with Lord Russell in being unprepared to accept it if any way of escape is possible. As it is, I confidently expect that the physiologists will soon produce strong independent evidence for the existence of the genes which the geneticists postulate ; and less confidently that either the neuro- logists or the experimental and clinical psychologists will produce satisfactory independent evidence of cerebral traces or of a persistent Unconscious. But in the meantime we have our mnemic laws ; and the best account of them seems to me to be given by treating them in exactly the same way as teleological laws and making the inductively inferred variancy the distinguishing feature. This variancy is frequently large in the case of mnemic laws as it is in teleological: Lashley's rats retained their acquired skill in running his maze after large, and different, portions of their brains had been removed. Both teleological and mnemic laws, then assert that there is a causal chain connecting the determining and the determined events which holds under a wide range of conditions, i.e., that the system in question has a large variancy; and this variancy or plasticity has not been deduced from non-teleological or non-mnemic laws but has been discovered inductively from observation. The difference between them, that in a teleological law the determining event succeeds the determined event whereas in a mnemic law it precedes it, seems unimportant in</page><page sequence="17">TELEOLOGICGNL EXPLANATION. Xvii comparison with their similarity ; and I shall therefore class both types together under what I will for the lack of a better name call " biotic laws." I choose this name because the biotic laws which have struck our attention are those which apply to living systems, but my definition of " biotic law" includes no reference to life. Sometimes both a mnemic and a teleological law can be subsumed under one more general biotic law which is itself both mnemic and teleological: Mendel's laws of heredity state that characteristics of a set of organisms both are statistically determined by those of its set of parents and also statistically determine those of its set of offspring. I offer therefore my general notion of biotic law, of which teleological law is a species, as an attempt to settle the dispute between the biological " mechanists " and the biological " teleologists ". But I fear that my solution will satisfy neither party. The teleologist will say that my whole account of teleological law in terms of causal chains and variancy of conditions presupposes the mechanist assumption that every event is physico-chemically deter- mined, and that to admit teleological explanations faute de mieux is to ignore the essentially irreducible character of teleological law for which he is contending. The mechanist will declare that he has no use for teleological laws unless they are ultimate and irreducible ; and that it is methodologically vicious to introduce new types of law just because we do not know all the laws of nature of the ordinary type. And both parties will join forces in criticising my treatment as being unduly epistemological: the controversy, they will both say, is not as to how we derive our knowledge of general propositions about goal-directed activity, but is about the content of these general propo- sitions : it is a question of the ultimate elements in the biological facts, not of the organisation of our present biological knowledge. All these criticisms, and the joint one particularly, are based upon what I as a philosophical logician regard as a naive attitude as to the function of a scientific law. For this function is just exactly that of organising our empirical b</page><page sequence="18">Xviii R. B. BRAITHWAITE. knowledge so as to give both intellectual satisfaction and power to predict the unknown. Every scientific law is a general hypothesis propounded, together with other such hypotheses, to serve as the premisses of a deductive system, more or less elaborate, in which propositions can be deduced whose truth or falsity is testable by observation. Whether or not the scientific hypothesis is accepted, thus being adjudged worthy of the title of " law of nature ", depends upon the agreement or disagreement of the observable consequences which follow from it in the system with experience. The nature of scientific laws cannot be treated independently of their function within a deductive-system. The world is not made up of empirical facts with the addition of the laws of nature: what we call the laws of nature are conceptual devices by which we organise our empirical knowledge and predict the future. From this point of view any general hypothesis whose consequences are con- firmed by experience is a valuable intellectual device, and the profitable use of such a hypothesis does not pre- suppose that it will not at some future time be subsumed under some more general hypothesis in a more widely applicable deductive system, nor that the facts which it explains will not some time be explicable by a quite different hypothesis in another deductive system. Biotic hypotheses behave exactly like other scientific hypotheses in that they can frequently be subsumed under more general biotic hypotheses. If this happens the old deductive system in which they were premisses is discarded in favour of a deductive system in which they appear as conclusions from the new premisses. The special teleo- logical law about a particular food as goal and a particular species of animal falls under a less special teleological law about food-seeking in general, and this again may be subsumed under a general teleological principle about self-preservation. Frequently one goal-directed activity in an animal (e.g., the building of a nest) is followed by another type (e.g., sitting on the eggs laid in the nest); and the succession of these two types of teleological activity falls under some general principle (e.g., the continuance of</page><page sequence="19">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANAI'ION. X1X the species). Discussions as to the proper classification of instincts are largely discussions as to which is the best general teleological deductive system for explaining the special instinctive modes of behaviour. When Dr. E. S. Russell puts forward the generalisation that " the goal of a directive action or series of actions is normally related to one or other of the main biological ends of maintenance, development and reproduction ",* he is suggesting that a deductive system which starts with premisses about these three ends will be able to absorb all the systems which are in.terms of particular goals. Of course none of these more elaborate deductive systems have been worked out in detail ; but the possibility, of constructing them makes teleological explana- tory hypotheses like the non-teleological ones in another respect also, namely that we can hope to provide further explanations, and a deeper intellectual satisfaction, by incorporating special laws in a unified system. I have given as part of the definition of a biotic law that it is not incorporated in a physico-chemical deductive system. But if such a law, already incorporated in a biotic deductive systemn (i.e. one with biotic laws as premisses), were to be found capable of physico-chemical explanation, we should not by that mere fact be estopped from continuing to make use of its place in the biotic system whenever we found that to be profitable. The chemical deductive system with Dalton's laws of atomic combination as premisses has in recent years been included more and more within the more general deductive system of physics ; but chemists find it far more convenient to treat most of their problems in terms of atoms and molecules than in terms of electrons or wave functions. And there is one feature of both teleo- logical and mnemic explanations which will almost certainly make them continue to be useful (whatever they would then be called) even if they could be superseded by physico- chemical ones. This feature is that usually teleological explanations make no reference to the exact length of time taken in attaining the goal, and mnemic explanations no reference to the exact length of time since the determining * Op. cit., p. 8o.</page><page sequence="20">XX R. B. BRAITHWAITE. event. Indeed the unimportance of the time taken in reaching the goal is implicit in the persistency feature of goal-directed activity emphasised by biologists. * Teleo- logical explanations do not specify the length of the causal chain, only that it attains the goal. So even if the bio- logical mechanists can provide us with a complete explanation of life in physico-chemical terms, we shall probably continue to give teleological (or what would previously have been called teleological) explanations whenever the exact time taken in reaching the goal does not interest us. I will conclude by summarising the biological part of my argument. I have tried to give an account of the distinguishing feature of teleological explanations without assuming that such explanations are ultimately irreducible to chemistry and physics and without requiring any novel concept of causal law. To do this I have followed biologists in emphasising the plasticity of goal-directed behaviour, and have analysed the peculiarity of a teleological explanation in terms of the related notions of the multi- plicity of the causal chains by which the goal may be attained and of the variety of conditions under which the goal-directed activity may occur. These notions I have found to be also involved in mnemic explanation. What I have drawn is only an outline sketch which will need much working upon to make a convincing picture. But I have done enough to convince myself that what I have been trying to do is possible; and that the realm of biology will not have to sacrifice the autonomy proper to it if physics should succeed in establishing the claim, made by many biologists on its behalf, to be the Emperor of all the Natural Sciences. * e.g., E. S. Russell, op. cit., p. 110; " If the goal is not reached, action usually persists ".</page></plain_text>
