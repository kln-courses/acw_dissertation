An enthusiasm for musical extremes is common to all three composers, as well as the other obvious links that two of them are women composers from the for- mer Soviet Union and that two of the works are called symphonies. Certainly the umbrella nature of this hard-worked genre- label has been severely stretched in recent years, but both these particular symphonies have a dialectical basis that makes for a notional link with tradition. And in each case, the opposite states encapsulated by the subtitle is indicative of its respective musi- cal trajectory (the 'Voices ... fall dumb' of the Gubaidulina, and Ruders' 'To heaven rejoicing - cast down unto death'). But there similarity ends. There are four con- ventionally patterned movements in the Ruders, as opposed to Gubaidulina's 12; while for all its explosive quality, the musi- cal statement of the Ruders sounds disci- plined and tightly controlled, whereas the extremes in the Gubaidulina come over as raw subjectivity. Where the Ruders fea- tures the transformation of musical states, Gubaidulina extends and amplifies. This 36-minute symphony by Ruders is also striking for what it reveals about the composer's ability to achieve and sustain convincing musical contrasts. So after the projection of tremendous musical energy that opens the first movement (from which blazes a quotation from Bach's Christmas oratorio) comes the almost static second. Ruders heads it with a line from Milan Kundera, 'the desert of time', a phrase that beautifully char- acterises this movement's slow revolution, like a mobile, about the axis of two chords. Only with the entry of the solo violin is there any slight melodic interest, but its line remains isolated from the orchestral texture, and eventually it becomes frozen into immo- bility. There is again violent contrast with the third movement, a frenzied but brief pas- sage which leads directly into the last, subti- tled 'Maschera funerale', whose musical events turn increasingly barren. The sym- phony as a whole presents an impressively unfolding drama. Rather more one dimen- sional is another work by Ruders, Gong, whose performance-indication 'Throbbing', with its implication of repetitive patterning, gives a good clue as to the nature of this pul- sating representation of kinetic energy. For the eponymous gong is also a reference to the sun, and Ruders calls the piece a 'symphonic drama about the life and behaviour of the sun'. The realisation is enacted with an extraordinary degree of primeval vividness. Gubaidulina's symphony-drama rests on exploiting the contrast between the two musical states laid out in the two opening movements: the changing colours of a D- major chord in the first, and the expression- ist gestures of the second. Characteristic of the latter are the glissando-surges which formed a salient feature of her work for accordion, cello and strings, Seven last words. References to the first movement provide a point of rest that underline the violence of the expanding territory of the second. The repertoire of material sounds anthropomorphic in its sighing, anger and much stirring in the depths, but over time it also seems wearisomely limited. You would have to be something of a believer in Gubaidulina's vision to find the symphony wholly satisfactory, or even for it to sustain the interest; the violin concerto Offertorium would make a better point of entry to those encountering her music for the first time. The massively scored companion piece, Stufen, takes even further the multi-dimen- sional approach suggested by parts of the symphony. Its surprise-end is Rozhdestven- sky's recitation of the poem on which the POUL RUDERS Photo: Malcolm Crowthers SOFIA GUBAIDULINA Photo: Malcolm Crowthers work is centred, a multilayered presenta- tion of the poem's deconstructed text. Except for Ustvolskaya's Trio, the music by these two ex-Soviet composers can seem more revealing about the social and artistic pressures of their society than they are suggestive of intrinsically convincing musical processes. Nevertheless, this disc of music by Ustvolskaya is remarkable in several respects. Firstly, it brings an emer- gence from the shadows of this fabled pupil of Shostakovich, a student whom he had praised in these extraordinary terms, 'It is not you who are influenced by me: rather it The Musical Times I 662 November 1993</page><page sequence="2">_1 ; _ l Reviews is I who am influenced by you'. Indeed, Shostakovich borrows from the Trio pre- sented here for his own Fifth String Quar- tet. (This seems but one aspect of a com- plicated relationship preliminarily sketched in Tempo no. 175 by Louis Blois.) But of the three works on the disc, it is only the Trio which falls within a recognisably Shostakovich orbit, and strikingly effective it is too. For this is a starkly sombre, intro- spective work that, despite the sparsest tex- tures, captures and holds attention through- out its 17-minute length. Extended solo plaints from the clarinet provide a main focus in the two slow opening movements, with a foil in the uncompromisingly bare, layered counterpoint of the final Energico. The overall effect is strangely unsettling, reinforced by the unexpected nature of the conclusion, in which harsh pitch reiteration forms a link with the nightmare world of the other two works. A second reason to remark upon Ustvol- skaya (b. 1919) is as the composer of some of the most turbulent and angry music which it is possible to imagine, and in this respect the Fifth Piano Sonata (1986) and the Duet for violin and piano (1952) are simply astonishing, if hardly pleasurable, experiences. The abrupt switches and the gestural and registral extremes of the ten- movement Fifth Sonata put in mind a more disciplined version of some of Schnittke's music. And contrary to what might seem implied by the work's sonata label, this is non-developmental music which proceeds in a series of contrasting blocks of material defined by a particular sort of event, such as the extended, mechanistic repetition of a single chord. The disruptive force of the Duet also seems a creative lifetime away from the poise of the Trio. Passion does not seem the motivation here, but a violent despair expressed with intimidating brutality which finds some sort of resolution in the quiet repose of the ending. Yet for all this, undoubtedly it is the Trio which is the most satisfyingly accomplished, and (iron- ically, in view of the decibel-shattering fury of the other two) the most powerful in the impression it leaves behind it. DAVID WRIGHT NANCARROW, CARTER, IVES, FELDMAN, LUCIER, YOUNG, CAGE, YIM: WORKS FOR STRING QUARTET Arditti Quartet Disques Montaignes 782010 Here is a neat summary of the American dichotomy: on the one hand those bold, muscular pioneers Ives, Nancarrow and Carter; on the other those unreformed dadaists Cage, Feldman, and LaMonte Young. One a school concerned largely with matters of rhythm and chronometry; the other intent upon destroying all clocks and received notions of musical and tem- poral perception. At least that's the theory, although in fact the works chosen for this recording, such as Carter's warmly romantic Elegy of 1946 and the works by Feldman and Young, tend to blur such obvious distinc- tions. This is an absorbing collection, and the finest thing on it is Nancarrow's end- lessly inventive First Quartet, a small masterpiece suggesting, at a slightly simpler level and within a broadly neo- classical soundworld, tentative comparisons with Carter's own First Quartet of six years later. This is not yet the Nancarrow of the piano-player studies and their extraordinary rhythmic construc- tions, but it is an important marker along the way and further proof of just how far ahead of their European contemporaries these composers were in discovering new worlds of rhythm and counterpoint. Of course the Nancarrow/Carter/ Cage/Feldman split is not the only schism in the American musical church. There's no minimalism on this disc, but there is, in Alan Jay Yim's Autmun music (1985), a passing hommage to the American Campus Composer. Does a composer's working environment affect the quality of his music? While the great American pio- neers have tended to lead lives outside the establishment circuit, whether in exile, in insurance, or even (in Henry Cowell's case) in prison, the work of their comfort- ably tenured university counterparts has tended to prove that a little residence in a seat of learning is a dangerous thing. Perhaps the (as it is generally perceived to be) pejorative Campus Composer tag doesn't quite do justice to Yim's efficient- ly characterised and craftsmanlike piece (and certainly Yim is no Babbitt, although whether this is taken to be an insult or a compliment depends on the state of one's liver), but the end result of Autumn music is just that - efficiency. It succeeds, in something over a quarter of an hour, in creating rather less of an impression than Ives's bawdy and rumbustuous Scherzo, with its misquoted popular songs and fiendish polyrhythms, does in a mere minute and a half. Ives is a perfect proof that composition is essentially a risk business, and certainly there's risk, albeit of a very different species, in the Zen-like worlds of Feldman, Cage and LaMonte Young. These early Feldman and LaMonte Young pieces, however, are not quite what one would expect. Feldman's Structures (exactly contemporary with the eponymous Boulez work) is an exquisite array of muted string sonorities disposed in typically immobile, statuesque patterns. If only, I'm tempted to say, all Feldman were like this. Although the soundworld and Feldman's attitude to his material are entirely charac- teristic, this music gives real evidence of having been composed, rather than simply allowed to happen, as in later works. And the same goes for LaMonte Young's On remembering a naiad: five tiny but per- fectly realised and extremely beautiful miniatures. Proof that here were two very fine composers, at least before it was decided that all the egocentric baggage involved in the act of composing - the exercise of selecting, choosing and order- ing - was a Bad Thing. On remembering a naiad not only has a voice, it also has the cardinal virute of brevity. By contrast, I'm still waiting to be convinced that Cage, except in a tiny handful of works, was even a composer, let alone a great one. Four is an etiolat- ed, 20-minute farrago of slowly drawn-out notes, all essence and absolutely no substance (small mercies, however: it could have been the 30- minute version). Not so much the Amercian dream as the Big Sleep. GAVIN THOMAS The Musical Times November 1993 663</page></plain_text>
