<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greek Poetic Syntax in the Classical Age. By VICTOR BERS. Yale Classical Monographs, 5. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1984. Pp. xix + 218. $20.00. After a preface (pp. ix-xi), a list of abbreviations (pp. xiii-xix), and an introduction (pp. 1-21), the book under review proceeds with six chapters: (1) "Number" (pp. 22-52 + four appendixes, pp. 52-61); (2) "The Terminal Accusative" (pp. 62-85); (3) "The Local Dative" (pp. 86-99 + one appendix, pp. 99-101); (4) "Voice"(pp. 102-16); (5) "Subjunctive, Optative, and 'av"(pp. 117- 65); (6) "Jussive, Optatival, and Exclamatory Infinitives" (pp. 166-86). There follow "Some Conclusions" (pp. 187-94) and three appendixes (pp. 195-203); the work ends with a list of the "Principal Texts and Commentaries," an index locorum, and a general index (pp. 205-18). "The book aims at finding the precise limits and rationale, whether aesthetic or semantic, of certain syntactical phe- nomena in classical Greek poetry . . ." (p. ix), with concentration on fifth- and fourth-century literature. Little can be said objectively regarding the aesthetic appreciation of poetic syntax (say, explaining the aesthetic difference between the terminal accusative Ri'faq and dig OffPaq), whether the opinions are those of others or Bers' own; but the tentative theories offered here are stimulating. The book's preface is obscure and the introduction diffuse. Beginning, however, with chapter 1, the book becomes readable, indeed enjoyable. B. here demonstrates both learning and &amp;yXivota. The book will be interesting to the average classicist on a theoretical level (above all in connection with B.'s review of the extant scholarly theories up to our day) and on a practical level (because of the many passages the author discusses and his sustained effort at presenting syntactical usage with an eye to how it is distributed among genres and authors). Since the book does not cover all topics of Greek poetic syntax in the classical age, its title promises more than the book delivers. The book has other weaknesses, most often apparent when B.'s suggestions prompt the verdict "non liquet." The following are examples, beginning with matters of a more general nature. The book, first, is tied to the theory that the Greeks experienced poetry by consciously observing how it deviates from the "ordinary, conventional, stylistically unremarkable" language, which B. terms "pedestrian gloss" (see esp. pp. 13-21). In support of this view he cites such</page><page sequence="2">344 BOOK REVIEWS passages as Aristotle Rhetoric 3. 1404b5-14 (where Aristotle compares poetry with prose and sees poetry as a departure from and elevation of the ordinary) and Poetics 1458b31-59a4 (where tragedians are said to employ expressions not used in everyday language). B.'s reasoning here will strike many as fallacious. Homo sapiens can compare linguistic products and catalog their differences. This, however, hardly means that he cannot experience each of these linguistic events directly, or at least without conscious comparisons, or that his experience-by- comparison is the most frequent or gratifying one. Further, if we were to suppose that the Greeks reached poetry by moving from a "lower" linguistic level upward, why should we suppose that they had to start from a level as low as the "pedestrian gloss," rather than from, say, the level of Kunstprosa? And, of course, why should we suppose that they had to move upward only, rather than from several directions at once, with their entire linguistic apparatus, omnia secum portantes? Occasionally, entire sections lack systematic and comprehensive exposition. This is the case, for example, in the section pertaining to the middle voice (chap. 4). Here the exposition suffers because B. has not reviewed the middle voice in terms of its meaning(s) and emotive value in the Indo-European family in general and in Greek in particular; and so the reader has no solid basis from which to proceed in the discussion of specific Greek texts. We would have expected a tabulation of the middle voice analogous to the one we find in the chapter on number (pp. 23-24), or else an explanation of why such a tabulation cannot be given and how this might affect the chances of an objective understanding of the middle. As a result, when B. (for example) rejects (p. 116) Kuihner-Gerth's interpretation of a class of middles which they amass at 1:109-10, the reader is helpless to decide whether B.'s rejection represents Wissenschaft or a whims How subjective and rhetorical B. can wax may be gathered, for example, from pages 34-35: As, in music, the character of what precedes and what follows makes quite different things of the same note, so in language the change of immediate context can alter the associations and emotional coloring of a word used twice with the same referent.... An illustration from Soph. OT 960-62...: Oi. r6Tpa 66okointv, i0 vouot 4t)vutk- ,;yi 1 'Ay. cs1Kpt icp6akaat Gdltt' si5v6?et 'oni. / Oi. v6oolt 6o tkXpov, 6; iot1KcV, iKpONto. v6cyou and v6aotg are not different in denotation. Though I could never prove it, I see the change from singular to plural as an appropriate means to follow the contour of Oedipus' emotions as they move from guarded question to relieved restate- ment of the messenger's obliquely worded report. The actor, I fancy, pronounced v6crotq with stronger voice than v6cou. We can now pass to the discussion of specific texts. At page 26, note 5, B. writes: "Jebb calls rupavvwv at Soph. Ant. 60 an 'allusive plural,' which mistakes the nuance. B. Knox explains the plural accurately: 'The word ... emphasizes the absolute power of Creon, conferred on him by the polis in the emergency, and at the same time by its plural form generalizes the expression and thus lessens the suggestion that he is a "tyrant"."' (a) In support of Jebb one can argue as follows: 'cupavvwiv qua plural points to tyrants and only through our logic (upa6vvwv = q xi3pavvo0 = Kp&amp;ov) to the tyrant Creon. The plural TvUpavVwv is then ipso facto an example of "allusive plural," a subclass of the literary technique we call</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 345 "allusion." We may venture to surmise that Jebb did not fish for any "nuance" of Vupdvvowv because he was practicing objective criticism and felt that no such nuance could be established objectively, indeed, that there is no reason to suppose that Sophocles had in mind any such nuance. (b) Against Knox one could argue as follows. We must first question whether through a single word, rUp&amp;vvo)v, Sophocles could have expected his audience to recognize both emphasis and lessening. Moreover, plural for singular constitutes a literary oyKoq which a priori is highly unlikely to lessen the force of a word: T&amp; 1TEk?0UVUtK&amp; Ptcyakop- pTpov&amp;T?rpa .. . .p ToX i ? o&amp; T aptOpov ([Longinus] 23. 2-3). It appears that Knox imposed the job of lessening on cupdvvowv by observing the possibility of a "democratic" sign in Wipov and thereby allowing his interest in variation, polarity, and the like to find a bit of the "democrat" in Creon as well. He writes: "The word 'vote' (x'pov) suggests that Creon's proclamation is no capricious gesture but the expression of a deliberative policy .. . and it also, with its democratic associations, hints that Creon speaks for the whole body of the citizens." J. C. Kamerbeek seems to this reviewer right when he observes: "Wi(pov -cupdVVowV i Kp&amp;L-Tl: it is all one and the same thing to the mind of Ismene. KpaTLf: the power of authority" (Comm. on "Antigone, "ad loc.). After all, why should we suppose that Ismene aims at softening the suggestion that Creon is a tyrant, when her purpose is to convince Antigone to avoid confrontation with him? And if there are other reasons in favor of avoiding such confrontation, why should we suppose that they had to be advanced by "lessen[ing] the suggestion that he is a'tyrant"' (cf. line 47)? Obviously Wipov (= KnpUypa, line 8) is here used sensu latiore as at Ant. 632, OT606, Aesch. Sept. 198, Eur. Andr. 1272. On page 27 we read: "H. L. Jones. . . is not justified in seeing plural-for- singular in Lysias 1. 4 [i.e., in taking ToV5 Talia6 ToV5 jPiot5 = O6v Eail&amp;a O6v .p6v].... Though it is true that the speaker has only one child at the time of the trial, the jury hears about him [= the child] in ?6, after the alleged plural-for- singular. More important, the speaker's extravagant complaint is not that his infant son in particular has been shamed . .. but that all his descendants have been shamed, present and future, from his unfaithful wife and any succeeding wives." Thus B. interprets the plural as plural in form and meaning. It is difficult for this reviewer to say what exactly B. had in mind when he wrote "the jury hears about him in ?6." Nevertheless, we may point out that the plural returns in ?26 (?apap-dveiv ?ist T-JV 7VVaKKa TxV ?P.JV Kati ?i5 TOV5 nal6aq ToV5 cjPio ... and so it makes little difference that in ?4 the plural precedes ?6 since in ?26 it also follows ?6. B. in the citation above calls the speaker's complaint "extravagant." Yet the complaint becomes "extravagant" and indeed illogical only in the light of B.'s interpretation. For if the speaker chooses to father more children with his present wife, the person to be responsible for the shame of these children will be the father, the speaker, who chooses to have them with a potX&amp;q instead of remarrying and begetting them by a wife of good repute. Children from a respectable second wife cannot be disgraced because their father's previous wife turned out to be an adulteress. The "extravagant complaint" disappears in Jones' interpretation, according to which the speaker argues most cogently: the seducer shamed my wife, and, by making her a potXod, he also shamed my child, who thus became stigmatized as the child of a potXaq Even if pluralis pro singulari did not</page><page sequence="4">346 BOOK REVIEWS occur elsewhere in Greek prose, B. still would not be justified in rejecting Jones' interpretation. The textual critic does not reject a di.at~ ipTlptvov for the sole reason that it is a dinat. Why should the syntactician adopt a different attitude in dealing with a Ptcna "pluralis pro singulari" in prose when the dtrnat makes uniquely good sense in the text, while any attempt to transform this plural into a genuine plural produces an inferior text? The plural seems to offer an "affective" O7KO5 perhaps not much different from what a modern Greek parent expresses when, hugging the little son or daughter, he exclaims not only "TO6 nta6i 1tou" but frequently, in the plural, "Ta mcua&amp; ptov," and does so even when there is only one child in the family. For nTal6aq as an emotive plural for singular in Lysias, observe his allusive plurals in 14. 41-42, where oi 6U VpucTpw.t . . = dv6peq (notice ?41 av6p&amp;5v) oi 1t. = &amp;vip [= 'AkKtPt&amp;6flq] OS Pt. Moreover, compare Sophocles Oedipus Tyrannus 1406-7, where we find six substantiva concreta, itcai one of them, in the emotive usage of pluralis pro singulari: irtcpaq, &amp;66k(pobq nal6aq,... vvtpaq yVVaIKCLs PTmpcTFaq - lraTEpa, a6ek(pov IEacla . . vUt(prv 7VvaLKa tfl-Tpa. Perhaps also T&amp; 7Tat6&amp;K&amp; (_ amasius), which occurs frequently in prose, was originally the product of emotive 67KO5, i.e., T&amp; lEat6&amp;K6 pro T6 TEat6tK6v' (the singular is attested in PTeb. 104. 20 [first century B.C.], and the likelihood of its existence in earlier Greek seems to receive support from P1. Symp. 178E cTppa6nEt6ov ?pcnauTdv Kai lat6tK(V, where on account of the genuine plural EpacMdv, the following lEat6lK(V is likely to be a genuine plural rather than a pluralis pro singulari, i.e., uTpaTr6ne6ov ?paWTOV Kati 1TEat6K(OV CTTpaTO6Ec6oV ?p6VToV KcJt Epo"?VWV, rather than uTpaTonC66ov ?pawT6v Kat ?po4I?vou [_ ?poptvuv per distributionem]). That (T&amp;) IEca&amp;K6 in time became a (quasi?) plurale tantum need not exclude an "emotive" origin. On pages 45-46, B. speculates that the plural YKnTETpa pro YKfnETPOV is likely to have occurred because a scepter "is composite, an ornament of some sort mounted on a wand." To him YKfnTipa = wand + crowning member (say, a metallic eagle), just as -6oa = bow + arrows (the type of plural he calls "ellip- tical": see p. 23, category no. f).2 Now, a bow and arrows are two separate items to our eyes, yet the two blend into one when we recognize their interrelation. Is not a composite scepter something different? A pcXatpa, too, is a composite object (it consists of a handle and a blade), but when on page 24 B. classifies pcXatpat (_ p6Xatpa), he does not put it in the same "elliptical" category. Now, extant evidence of the usage YKiE-rpa = TKnlEUpOV does not antedate the fifth century; yet B. overrules the evidence and decides that the usage must antedate the fifth century it "must be an archaism" (p. 46). If we ask why it should be an archaism, the only answer we can find is that "elliptical plurals were not created in the 5th cent." (p. 46), an answer which obviously begs the question.3 1. To tat6tK6v seems to be a substantivized adjective, e.g., tO nltcLKov Kptriou = tO TatcLKov (sc. p?tkqpa) Kpvriou = nal 8; p?k?t KptTia = the boy Critias "cares" about (for ptXo in an erotic sense, cf. Theog. 1319-20, Pind. Pyth. 10. 59, Diod. Anth. Pal. 5. 122, 4 sq.). 2. In his discussion of number, B. makes it axiomatic that T6oa is an "elliptical" plural. Perhaps it is, but did not Witte's suggestion of an analogical formation (T64a like 6ika, B., p. 57) deserve at least a refutation? 3. Many are likely to prefer Jones' view (B., p. 46) that cKmxr-pa (= (mnTtpov) came to be used by analogy: "the king possesses scepters just as he possesses powers (Kpdtfl)."</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 347 On page 105 B. discusses Pindar Olympian 7. 15-16 and argues that -Tu(pavco- cydpevov is probably passive. He notes only two possible interpretations: either the athlete puts the crown of victory on his own head (where the participle is middle in meaning), or the athlete is crowned by an official (where the participle is passive in meaning). He grants that "it is not unthinkable that a Greek athlete crowned himself," but he opts for the second possibility (as, e.g., at 01. 3. 10-16). A tertium quid, however, can be noted. In interpreting aorists in -c6&amp;tliv, we must remember that grammarians agree that these aorists are very rarely (if indeed ever) used passively. B. himself states that Kuihner-Gerth (1:118) "are determined to show that the sigmatic aorist is totally inhospitable to passive uses"; and earlier (p. 103) he recognized that sigmatic aorists with passive meaning are not found in Homer. Plainly, then, when we find an aorist in -cap6iv it is a priori very likely that the aorist is not passive in meaning. At Olympian 7. 15 Pindar calls Diagoras VOVp&amp;Xav ... ekOp6pov 0v6pa. LSJ translates c,v0OpdXaq somewhat obscurely, "fighting openly," but we get the meaning more clearly when we consider LSJ S.VV. Ou~OpaX?o, -ia, as well as the corresponding Ionic iOupaXia, -p&amp;tXoq, where we find "fairly" added to "openly." Diagoras is a FvOuptdXaq in that he fights (and wins) fairly, not with tricks. Diagoras is thus celebrated both for his nOoq (cf. Alexander's ov' K?ET() TiV ViKflV in Plut. Alex. 31. 7) and for his bodily might: he becomes the perfect victor who earns for himself the crown of victory in absolute terms. On the level of a higher (abstract, ideal) reality, this means that Diagoras places the crown of victory on his own head (the participle is middle in meaning), regardless of whether on the level of visible, physical reality some LkkavotiKac or other puts the crown on Diagoras' head. The meaning of the middle thus understood makes good sense (whether or not Kuhner-Gerth had this sense in mind when they analyzed the participle as "coronam sibipeperit": see B., p. 105, n. 12). We may thus reasonably suppose that the middle -uTc(pav6LaTo also has the same complimentary ring in verse 81 of the same ode, and it may further be suggested that it is used in this flattering way even when the poet does not explicitly present the victor in such glorious terms as those of Olympian 7. 15-16 (e.g., at 01. 12. 17). If the middle 'sTc(pav6xwaTo gives excellent sense as a true middle, why should we render it as passive in violation of the rule of -c6ajPrv aorists? Earlier on page 105 B. cites Simonides' poem on the "fleecing" of the athlete Crios (TInt~aO' 6 Kpt65 KTk. [Page, PMG 507]) and concludes that the aorist middle is passive in meaning because Strepsiades at Aristophanes Nubes 1356 "replaces the aorist middle with the aorist passive 'IntOri, which shows that Aristophanes did not think Simonides' verb carried a middle meaning, e.g., 'had himself a haircut."' This is ingenious. Consider, however, the following. From the testimonia Page offers it becomes clear that in TInt~aO' 6 Kpt6q Simonides plays with the athlete's name Kpt6q and the nomen appellativum Kpt6q = "ram" (see Page, PMG 507: Tn ip6 T06 ~4ov Kotvoiaqt ktU eo)q cyvtiT?d ULe a5 KoMiMaq 6 notonyn5). For Kpt6q, the athlete, the proper verb would have been Ktipopat, for the "ram" TETKOpat (according to LSJ, s.v. 1E?K(, the verb, including the middle aorist (?)ni?dp jv, can properly be used of humans only in the sense of "I comb my hair"; this meaning, however, does not seem to suit Simonides' text as long as</page><page sequence="6">348 BOOK REVIEWS the wordplay between Kpt6q and KptOl is maintained). Now, the middle aorist EKiCpa6tljv would mean "I cut my hair off" or "I had my hair cut off." It is here likely that Simonides playfully transferred the middle aorist usage from Kcip&amp;8act, used of humans, to FKFcY0at (see LSJ, s.v. t?K(o 2), used properly of animals (where only the passive F'.mtX0Xv [sc. urco Ttvoq] would have been meaningful, since a ram, or for that matter any KTVOq, "is sheared": it does not "shear itself" or "have itself sheared").4 Strepsiades, on the other hand, in his rusticity switches to the passive aorist: the switch constitutes an Aristophanic joke by which this athlete, whom Simonides through the jocular aorist middle ?:7rtca0' treats as semi-human, now becomes a "ram" tout court. On page 176, citing Plato Cratylus 426B To6To(v o'V (o0tcTa66x'o, av Poio cb 6' av Tt FXq ?kTtOV Io0?EV ka4CIV, nUp50at Kat sPoI PETa6t6ovat, B. takes both etptcn0at and peTa,6t66vat as jussive infinitives. This reviewer believes that ptcta&amp;66vat (an infinitive not in indirect discourse) depends on etpao0atl: the construction is itpdca0at (= jussive infinitive) petac6t66vat Kati t4ioi, the Kaci (= etiam) going with Fspoi (dust as the ordo verborum of Plato's text suggests), not with PFTa6t66vat. In its full implication, the translation of nitp&amp;o0at-PFTa- 660,vat would be something like this: "try to impart it to me as well-please, do not keep it exclusively to yourself!" On page 182 B. offers Demosthenes 21. 51 (the oracle), where he marks the infinitives pu4tviaOat . . . icydvat .. . Kvtav as "jussive infinitives" (that is to say, as infinitives of the same type as d R?1v' aYyFckkV KTX. in Simon. 167P. [see B., p. 166, and cf. Smyth ?2013]). In this reviewer's opinion the three infinitives constitute an indirect command depending on 5u66 (= pooT6ooo, see LSJ, s.v. Waoa 11.2, and Smyth ?1997). Construe: ac66 'EpX0Fi6,1ctv, -o V..i. vate, Kai .. . i0i5vc0' ..., ptpvila. ... i(T&amp;vat ... KvtaYv.... Translate: "I com- mand you E., as many as dwell and . .. direct . . . , to remember.. to set... to fill with the savor of burnt sacrifices.... For auP6 TIvt + infinitive, see Eur. IT 1226. The flow of cPMi 'EpeX0Oi8&amp; I9tv [= indirect object] postulates a direct object. For this reason a Greek would by instinct take the following three infinitives as dependent. Since the jussive infinitive is as independent as the imperative, the three infinitives in this context cannot be easily recognized as jussive, and therefore they were not meant to be jussive. 4. By "meaningful" I mean "logically expected" in terms of realistic (as opposed to figurative) usage. But what of Theoc. 28. 12-13, where the subject of ict.,atVT(O) is tdrEpFs tipVtoV, i.e., "ewes"? Is the middle here passive in meaning? In Theoc. 1. 74-75 06Fi . .. acipot ... 6acdkaXt ... it6pTri, lament for Daphnis anthropomorphically, as the verb d6OpavTo, normally applied to humans, shows. It may well be then that in Theoc. 28. 13 it.luavt(o) is also used in a similar, anthropomorphic way. If so, the poet, treating the ewes as quasi-humans, says that they "would shear themselves" or "would have themselves sheared" (both alternatives are middle in sense), not that "they would be sheared" (in passive sense). After all, since the poet presents Ot6yEvs4 with a distaff, it is quite appropriate that the wool which complements this distaff would come as a gift from willing ewes, rather than as a product taken from exploited KInvq, especially since the donor of the distaff is 6 JiouKokoic6q noi.71'1 par excellence. Theocritus humanizes the ewes with nt,altvt(o) (a middle in form and sense) as much as Simonides bestializes Kpt,g with rtna0'. To quote Smyth ?1715: "The future middle is often, the first aorist middle is almost never, used passively." I wish that B. had cataloged all the instances of middle sigmatic aorists with "passive meaning," so that we might examine them closely and thereby measure the strength of Smyth's "almost never."</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 349 In spite of the criticisms above (the examples could be multiplied),' it is just to repeat that the book is worth reading, for the reasons stated at the beginning of the review.

For example, on p. 1 1, line 13, we ought to have ?1C, since one says eK Hetpatd4 Further, on p. 109, lines 10-13, B. ought to have given us something like 6Tav 6 6aipe)v &amp;MT&amp; elT cpsXo0vea (B.'s &amp;U6pyftat is even extra constructionem).

Or. 667 the adverb ?6 constitutes an instance of "abstraction in the sense of nonparticularity"-?U replaces Tl dpOEotivta (for the participle, cf. dxpsXciv in Eur. Or. 666 and 668). On p. 171, lines 32-33, the participle in Hippoc. Aer. 24 can much better be called a participle of means/manner than be analyzed as TsKpaipou (a monstrous participium pro imperativo); and on p. 103, line 14, the sentence "A typical use is k6youq otoIO6p?vot for tyouotv..." must be rewritten to accommodate XtyoucIv of P1.
