Philosophie et exegese dans le Jardin de la metaphore de Moise Ibn 'Ezra. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1997. Pp. xiii + 459. After a successful career as a Hebrew poet, Moses Ibn Ezra (c. 1055- 1138) devoted two expository works written in Judeo-Arabic to his other interests, including literary criticism, philosophy, and biblical exegesis. The more unique of the two works, Kitab al-Muhiidara wal-Mudhdkara (The Book of Discussion and Conversation), a Hebrew poetics based on the Ara- bic model, has received a good deal of scholarly attention, including two critical editions with modern Hebrew and Spanish translations.2 The less fortunate MaqAilat al-IHadiqa f Ma'na l-majaz wal-Haqiqa (The Treatise of the Garden on Figurative and Literal Language), a philosophical-exegetical treatise, remains available only in manuscript and has not been translated into a modern language, compelling many modern readers to rely on frag- ments of the medieval Hebrew translation (entitled Sefer 'Arugat ha-Bosem) published in the 19th century.3 Paul Fenton first addressed this imbalance 1 This essay was completed while I was a Research Fellow at the Center for Ad- vanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, which provided a stimulating and congenial atmosphere for my research.

Since Fenton has demonstrated his mastery of Moses Ibn Ezra's heretofore neglected philo- sophical-exegetical work in his own impressively wide-ranging study, we eagerly await his forthcoming edition of Maqailat al-IHadiqa with a modern Hebrew translation.5 In his introduction (pp. 3-61), Fenton describes Ibn Ezra's writings, his cultural milieu, and the extant manuscripts of Maqalat al-IHadiqa (including fragments from the Cairo genizah he has discovered). The introduction con- cludes with a valuable table of the contents of Maqiilat al-IHadiqa's two sections. The first section, on philosophy, defines the interpretive concepts majiiz and haqiqa, and analyzes such topics as God's unity, incorporeality, and unknowability, and creation, man's nature, and the commandments. The second section, devoted to exegesis, is arranged like a dictionary in which Ibn Ezra catalogues the literal and figurative meanings of biblical words associated with the human body, and reinterprets anthropomorphic depic- tions of God so that they do not contradict the philosophical tenets estab- lished in the first section of the Maqiila. Fenton (pp. 240-242) composes a detailed outline of this dictionary and shows that it follows an Arabic Aris- totelian medical categorization. The two parts of Fenton's book correspond roughly to the primary division of the Maqiila: in part one he discusses Ibn Ezra's philosophy (pp. 65-234); in part two, his exegesis (pp. 235-388), including an analysis of the majiiz-haqiqa dichotomy.6 Philosophie et exegese includes four important appendices. The first is comprised of twenty-six passages of the lost Arabic original of Ibn Gabirol's small sections of the text, one on the misvot, the other on music, were published with translations: (1) A. S. Halkin, "Moses Ibn Ezra's Conception of the Commandments" (Heb.), Arabic and Islamic Studies 2 (1978) 26-40; (2) A. Shiloah, "The Musical Passage in Ibn Ezra's Book of the Garden," Yuval: Studies of the Jewish Music Re- search Centre 4 (1982) 211-224; repr. in The Dimension of Music in Islamic and Jewish Culture (London, 1993), chap. 4. The 19th century translation is by L. Dukes in Siyyon 2 (1842-43) 117-123; 134-137; 157-160; 175. 4Although Philosophie et exe`gese reflects the hand of a mature scholar, the cau- tious and deliberate writing in Fenton's 1976 Sorbonne dissertation occasionally yields greater precision; see, e.g., below, n. 45. 5Scheduled for publication by Mekize Nirdamim (Jerusalem) in 2004. 6For a more detailed summary, see A. Schippers' review of Philosophie et exe- gese in Bibliotheca Orientalis 58 (2001) 272-277.</page><page sequence="3">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 535 Fons Vitae cited in Maqialat al-IHadiqa.7 Appendix II is an index of He- brew, Arabic and Greek authors and works cited in Maqiilat al-Hadiqa. The lines of medieval Hebrew poetry cited by Ibn Ezra are listed in Appen- dix III, Arabic poetry in Appendix IV. Many of these are cited anony- mously in Maqiilat al-.Hadiqa. Fenton has traced their authorship with the help of Ezra Fleischer (Hebrew), Arie Schippers (Arabic), and Geert Jan van Gelder (Arabic). Unfortunately Fenton has not included an index of bibli- cal references in Maqalat al- Hadiqa, an omission which is surprising, since he did so in his dissertation. The extensive bibliography is divided into three sections: (1) Moses Ibn Ezra: 1'homme et son siecle; (2) Philosophie Juive et Arabe; (3) Exegese et rhetorique. While this division is reasonable and helpful, it is sometimes applied in a confusing manner.8 The philosophical portion of Philosophie et exegese has been reviewed by S. Harvey, who questions Ibn Ezra's acumen in this field and considers the first part of Maqalat al-Hadiqa little more than a patchwork of cita- tions.9 He agrees with Fenton that this eclectic anthology is valuable for the sources cited in it, sources that influenced later thinkers, especially kabbal- ists, a topic Fenton has since revisited in a separate article.10 But Harvey considers it more significant that Ibn Ezra's philosophy was out of date, since Maqdlat al-Hadiqa reflects the Neoplatonic thought of the "Brothers of Purity" (ihwan as-safa') and Ibn Gabirol, rather than the newer Aristo- telian outlook of Ibn Sind (d. 1036) and Ibn Bajja (d. 1138). Although Ibn Ezra cites the great Aristotelian philosopher al-FarTbi (d. ca. 950), Harvey 7Some of these passages have been identified by Fenton, others by earlier schol- ars. See Fenton, Philosophie et exegese, p. 39. 8 The following titles in section one might be better placed in "Exegese et rheto- rique": J. Dana, Poetics of Mediaeval Hebrew Literature according to Moshe Ibn Ezra (Hebrew); D. Pagis, Secular Poetry and Poetic Theory: Moses Ibn Ezra and His Contemporaries (Hebrew); M. Zohari, "R. Moshe Ibn Ezra ke-IHoqer ha-Miqra." The first two of these works deal primarily with Ibn Ezra's poetics; the third with his exe- gesis. I. Efros, Philosophical Terms in Moreh Nebukim, listed in section one, is better suited for inclusion in Philosophie Juive etArabe, as is D. Baneth, "On the Philosoph- ical Terminology of Maimonides," which appears in section three. At times, the bibli- ography's division leads to unnecessary repetition that highlights inconsistencies. E.g., Schippers' Spanish Hebrew Poetry and the Arabic Literary Tradition is listed as hav- ing been published in Leiden in 1994 (p. 421) and also Amsterdam in 1993 (p. 440); Brann's Compunctious Poet in 1990 (p. 418) and 1991 (p. 434). Other small errors crop up in the bibliography: Scheindlin is misspelled as Schindlin (p. 421); Sefer ha- Galui was written by Joseph Kimhi, not David Kimhi (p. 439; cf. p. 437); the refer- ence to "H. Wolfart" (p. 441) should be corrected to W[olfhart] Heinrichs (p. 436). 9 Pe'amim 73 (1997) 147-152 (in Hebrew). lOp.

By con- trast, Maimonides, born at the time of Ibn Ezra's death, fully integrated the work of those Arab Aristotelians in his system of Jewish philosophy. Even Judah Halevi, Ibn Ezra's poetic protege and himself a Neoplatonist, knew enough about that Aristotelian intellectual trend to reject it strongly in his Kuzari, written soon after Maqdlat al-IHadiqa (Harvey, 151). Harvey's sound review of the work's first section frees us to focus on the second part of Philosophie et exegese and to evaluate how it illuminates Ibn Ezra's biblical interpretation, which, in this reviewer's opinion, repre- sents his more profound intellectual contribution. In philosophy, Ibn Ezra may have been out of his element; but as a skilled poet he was well equipped to elucidate the language and literary style of Scripture. To be sure, Ibn Ezra is heavily indebted to his sources, both Jewish and Arab, as Fenton meticulously documents, but this hardly diminishes his importance in the exegetical tradition. 1 " Modern scholarship on other medieval authors- Abraham Ibn Ezra (Moses Ibn Ezra's younger contemporary, but not a relative) and Maimonides come to mind-underscores their debt to earlier sources without questioning their achievements. 12 Moses Ibn Ezra likewise made his mark in three exegetical areas: philosophical, linguistic-philological, and aesthetic. 13 In Philosophie et exegese, Fenton meaningfully addresses all three of these areas. Subsequent scholars of Ibn Ezra's exegesis will be heavily indebted to his ground-breaking contribution. It is in this spirit of indebtedness that I will highlight below what I consider to be the author's most important insights into Moses Ibn Ezra's biblical exegesis and offer some further perspectives, especially on the great poet's unique aesthetic approach to Scripture. 1 Here I take issue with Harvey (p. 151), who suggests in passing that Ibn Ezra's exegesis is a patchwork of citations from his great linguistic predecessors, especially Ibn Janah, a conclusion he seems to have drawn by analogy with the philosophical section of Maqalat al- Hadiqa. Ibn Ezra, in fact, uses the works of these predecessors critically, as Fenton demonstrates (see below, p. 541). 12On Abraham Ibn Ezra, see U. Simon, "Abraham Ibn Ezra," HBOT, pp. 377-387; M. Perez, "The Criticisms of Jehuda Ibn Balaam of Moshe Ibn Gikatila according to New Fragments of their Commentaries on the Psalms (Hebrew), Proceedings of the Twelfth World Congress of Jewish Studies, Division A: The Bible and Its World, ed. Ron Margolin (Jerusalem, 1999), pp. 43-51. On Maimonides, see I. Twersky, "Did R. Abraham Ibn Ezra Influence Maimonides?" (Hebrew), in Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra: Studies in the Writings of a Twelfth Century Jewish Polymath, eds. I. Twersky and J. Harris (Cambridge, MA, 1993), pp. 21-48 [Hebrew section]; S. Klein-Braslavy, King Solomon and Philosophical Esotericism in the Thought of Maimonides (Hebrew) (Jerusalem, 1996). 13 These are delineated in my recent essay, "The Aesthetic Exegesis of Moses Ibn Ezra," HBOT, pp. 282-301.</page><page sequence="5">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 537 1. PHILOSOPHICAL EXEGESIS Even if Ibn Ezra's philosophy was not up to date, he participated mean- ingfully in the medieval "philosophical" exegetical movement that aimed to reconcile Scripture with reason, which was his motive for writing Maqalat al-IHadiqa in the first place. 14 Ibn Ezra argues that the language of Scrip- ture must be taken literally, that is, as haqiqa (truth), unless it contradicts sense perception, philosophical reflection, or beliefs transmitted by tradition, in which case it must be taken as majaz (non-literal language, on which see below) and reinterpreted (Fenton, pp. 299-332). The resulting interpretation is also called haqiqa, since it reveals the "true" meaning of the majiiz ex- pressions. This program was applied especially to anthropomorphic depic- tions of God, about which Ibn Ezra comments: One must treat these majaz expressions delicately and realize that the true matter (al-ma'na al-haqiqi) is too subtle and exalted for us to know it in its true nature. The intelligent person must strip them [the majdz expressions] of these husks ... to reach the desired [matter] ac- cording to the ability of his discernment.15 The interpreter's role is to get behind Scripture's majaz language, which hides its true meaning (haqiqa). Fenton cites a wide range of earlier sources that represent the philo- sophical exegetical tradition Ibn Ezra inherited. After identifying precursors in rabbinic literature (pp. 257-258), Fenton cites Arab (pp. 258-266) and Jewish authors (pp. 266-298) who developed elaborate exegetical theories based on the majaz-haqiqa dichotomy. Fenton goes far beyond the standard references to Sa'adia's well-known four rules of non-literal interpretation, to which Ibn Ezra was clearly indebted. He shows, for example, that Ibn Ezra's programmatic exegetical statement cited above is adapted from a passage in Bahya's philosophical work, Duties of the Heart. 16 Picking up 14 On this school, see R. Brody, "The Geonim of Babylonia as Biblical Exegetes," HDOT, pp. 80-88; S. Klein-Braslavy, "The Philosophical Exegesis," HBOT, pp. 302- 320. 15 Maqalat al-IHadiqa 45-46 (cited by Fenton, p. 118).

Cohen, "'The Best of Poetry': Literary Approaches to the Bible in the Spanish Peshat Tradition," The Torah u-Madda Journal 6 (1995/6) 27- 28; idem, "Radak vs. Ibn Ezra and Maimonides: A New Approach to Derekh Mashal in the Bible" (Hebrew), Proceedings of the Twelfth World Congress of Jewish Stud- ies, Division A: The Bible and Its World, ed.

Rawidowicz cited these two important passages from Bahya and Ibn Ezra separately, without pointing out the connection between them; see "Be'ayat ha-hagshama le-Resag ve-la-Rambam," Hebrew Studies in Jewish Thought (Jerusalem, 1969), pp. 182, 188.</page><page sequence="6">538 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW where M. Zucker left off in his studies of this exegetical school, Fenton places the Jewish tradition of philosophical biblical exegesis within the con- text of Arab studies of the Qur'an (pp. 243-255). He also cites comments, including some from newly identified genizah manuscripts, by the Karaite authors Qirqisani and Yeshu'a ben Yehuda, and the Rabbanite authors Sam- uel ben Hofni and Hai Gaon, whose discussions parallel Ibn Ezra's and may have influenced him. 17 2. PHILOLOGICAL EXEGESIS Although the principles of majiaz-based exegesis were well established by Ibn Ezra's time, there was ample room for him to develop this exegeti- cal mode. He applies the philological style and rigor of Ibn Janah's general dictionary to the philosophically sensitive issue of biblical anthropomorph- ism, which was treated in passing in the broader philosophical and exeget- ical works of predecessors such as Sa'adia, Samuel ben Hofni and Bahya Ibn Paquda. By contrast, Maqailat al-IHadiqa is a thoroughly linguistic work that treats an entire segment of the Hebrew lexicon comprehensively with respect to majaz usage. Its entries span the spectrum of biblical terms asso- ciated with human beings (male, female, heart, child, sister, brother, body, birth, youth, old age, head, face, eyes, tongue, teeth, voice, hand, etc.), and each lists literal, figurative, and idiomatic usages, which Ibn Ezra determines with the help of Rabbinic Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic cognates (Fenton, pp. 309-341). By demonstrating that majaz analysis reflects a typical fea- ture of Biblical Hebrew and is not simply an incidental strategy devised for alleviating ideological dilemmas, Ibn Ezra makes a stronger case for his philosophical exegesis than his predecessors did. It is conceivable that this linguistic format appealed to Maimonides and inspired him to write the so-called "lexicographic" section of his Guide for the Perplexed (1: 1-49). 18 That section, which may have originally been com- posed as an independent work, is likewise arranged as a dictionary of an- thropomorphic terms that includes literal and figurative usages, with the latter being applied to verses about God. 19 Although Fenton (pp. 338-339, citing 17 On the possibility of Karaite influence on Ibn Ezra, see below, n. 33. 18 See M. Cohen, Three Approaches to Biblical Metaphor: From Abraham Ibn Ezra and Maimonides to David Kimhi (Leiden 2003), pp. 202-203. The suggestion that Moses Ibn Ezra influenced Maimonides' project in the Guide was raised by W. Bacher, who had only fragments of Maqalat al- Hadiqa, in Die Bibelexegese Moses Maimuni's (Budapest, 1896), p. vi. 19 See H. Kasher, "Is There an Early Stratum in the Guide of the Perplexed?"

Strauss, "How to Begin to Study the Guide of the Perplexed," Moses Maimonides: The Guide of the</page><page sequence="7">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 539 S. Pines) does suggest that Maimonides was influenced by Maqiilat al- .-adiqa, he points only to their identical explanation for the appellation of Hebrew as "the sacred tongue" (leshon ha-qodesh). But the shared lexico- graphic format is also noteworthy and could lead to a fruitful comparative study of the two dictionaries. In fact, it is interesting to consider the possibil- ity that Maimonides was thinking of Ibn Ezra when he wrote this program- matic statement: When we mention one of the equivocal terms in this Treatise, it is not our purpose to cite all the senses in which that particular term is used, for this is not a treatise on language. Of those senses we cite only such as we require for our purposes and no others.20 Even seemingly superfluous definitions in the lexicographic chapters, Maimo- nides informs us, serve his philosophical program elsewhere in the Guide. 21 With which "treatise on language" was Maimonides contrasting his work? Though Ibn Janah's influential dictionary naturally comes to mind, especially because Maimonides often relied on it, it is conceivable that Maimonides was referring to Maqalat al- Hadiqa.22 By contrasting the lexicographic sec- tion of the Guide with another philosophically oriented philological work, Maimonides could define his own more specialized genre of philosophical exegesis. Like the Guide, Maqalat al-IHadiqa is philosophically motivated, but in Maimonides' opinion it digresses too much and blurs its focus by in- cluding study of language for its own sake, as one might expect from the work of an ardent poet. Indeed, a distinctively digressive and wide-ranging style characterizes the dictionary section of Maqailat al-IHadiqa, reflecting its author's erudition in poetry, philosophy, medicine, art and music. Fenton (pp. 321-332) gives his readers a taste of this discursive style by translating the long entry on the heart (:i) and shorter one on knowledge (nvt). The former (Maqailat al- Ijadiqa 224-233) begins with Hippocrates' medical descriptions of the heart, followed by one poetic view of the heart as "the lamp of the body" and another as its "ruler," with the arteries its provinces and the limbs its ser- vants. Ibn Ezra himself views the heart as fertile land that must be cultivated Perplexed, trans. S. Pines (Chicago, 1963), pp. xxi-xlvii; Klein-Braslavy, HBOT, pp. 312-316. Like Ibn Ezra, Maimonides also draws upon parallels from Rabbinic Hebrew and Arabic, as well as biblical language. 20 Guide of the. Perplexed 1.10, trans.

When ob- serving that :i' means the middle of an inanimate object, as in the BH ex- pression "the heart of the sky" (o)nwin ni; Deut 4:1 1), Ibn Ezra points to the identical Arabic idiom (xNnvz2N n)p)' as well as a similar one, "the liver of the sky" (xNnozvf m)' which does not occur in Hebrew. Digressing, he cites the line of Arabic poetry, "the sun is ill in the midst of the sky," which implicitly relies on this anatomic analogy, as if the sun were the sky's heart or liver.25 To illuminate Ps 12:3, "Man speaks falsehood . .. with heart and heart they speak," Ibn Ezra cites the Arabic saying "he has two hearts and two tongues," meaning that he "says something other than what he thinks." This entry of Maqalat al-IHadiqa illustrates Ibn Ezra's use of Arabic to understand BH. Boldly engaging in a centuries-old controversy, he is an ardent comparativist in many areas-grammatical, philological and literary (Fenton, pp. 341-374). Ibn Ezra uses Arabic to account for anomalous bib- lical grammatical forms and to explain rare or otherwise difficult BH roots and words. Despite the controversy, those strategies were already entrenched in the Hebrew lexicographic tradition;26 but Ibn Ezra also draws on Arabic expressions and turns of phrase to illuminate biblical idiomatic usages, build- ing on a precedent set by Ibn Janah.27 Ibn Ezra's unique contribution to the medieval discipline of comparative semitics is his liberal use of medieval poetry, both Hebrew and Arabic, to advance novel biblical readings.28 Apart from his own engagement in comparative philology, Ibn Ezra was in a position to take stock of this trend. He audaciously argues that the Jews 23 These analogies are called tamthilat in Arabic poetics and generated a type of derivative metaphor; see the discussion of metaphor below, p. 549. 24 The reference here to Eccl 1: 12 (Fenton, p. 326) should be corrected. 25 Instead of rendering xnovx tv1 in this line (see Arabic on p. 407) ". . . coeur du ciel," as Fenton does (p. 326), I prefer to render it literally, i.e., "the midst of the sky," in order to distinguish it from the more vividly metaphorical BH expression osnwn 35 and its Arabic equivalent xnv5x z5p. 26 See A. Saenz-Badillos, "Early Hebraists in Spain: Menahem ben Seruq and Du- nash ben Labrat," HBOT, pp. 103-104; A. Maman, "The Linguistic School: Judah Hayyuij, Jonah ibn Janah, Moses ibn Chiquitilla and Judah ibn Bal'am," HBOT, pp. 261-281. 27 For example, Ibn Janah (Kitab al-Luma' 315; Sefer ha-Riqmah 331) had already noted the Arabic parallels to the BH expression o)nyn 35 (Fenton, p. 326). 28 See A. Schippers, Spanish Hebrew Poetry and the Arabic Literary Tradition (Leiden, 1994), pp. 37-40. To be sure, Moses Ibn Ezra was not the first to cite Arabic poetry to illuminate Scripture (something Ibn Janah, for example, does), but he does so more regularly than other Hebrew linguists. Given the significance of this distinc- tive feature of Ibn Ezra's work, Fenton's Appendices III and IV (see above, p. 535) are especially important.</page><page sequence="9">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 541 did not adequately understand the workings of the Hebrew language until they were exposed to Arabic (Kitab al-Muhaidara 29b; Fenton, pp. 347- 348). He argues that Hayyuj, who (silently) drew upon Arabic grammatical thought, had a better understanding of Hebrew than all earlier authorities, in- cluding Sa'adia, and that he alone was the true father of Hebrew linguistics (Kitab al-Muhc dara 30a-b). On the other hand, Ibn Ezra expresses mixed feelings about Isaac Ibn Barun's Book of Comparison between the Hebrew and Arabic Languages. Although he sees value in the work and uses it himself, he criticizes its wholesale application of the comparative method, which extends to finding alleged Latin and Berber cognates of biblical words (Kitaib al-Muhaidara 21b-22a; Fenton, pp. 346-347). In learned notes throughout Philosophie et exegese and in a chapter en- titled "Sources and Influences," Fenton traces Ibn Ezra's linguistic insights to earlier authors and influence on later ones (pp. 375-388). Ibn Ezra most frequently drew upon Ibn Janah, to whom he refers as the foremost author- ity on Hebrew language.29 Other predecessors whose works Ibn Ezra used include Sa'adia, Ibn Bal'am, and Ibn Gikatilla. As a linguist in his own right, Ibn Ezra critically evaluates their views and is willing to disagree even with Ibn Janah. Of equal importance are reflections in Maqailat al-IHadiqa on the relative impact of these authors in 12th-century Andalusia, an exe- getical landscape that would soon be lost, when the school of Andalusian authors writing in Judeo-Arabic disappeared as a result of the Reconquista. Ibn Ezra's philological exegesis also reflects a variety of cultural tensions that challenged the Andalusian school. As Fenton (pp. 243-352) observes, Jewish authors-among whom he includes Moses Ibn Ezra-were threat- ened by the notions of i'jaz al-qur'an (the stylistic inimitability of the Qur'an) and 'arabiyya (the superiority of Arabic over other languages), and tended to reject them in favor of the Hebrew Bible and its language. Al- though Ibn Ezra expresses this sentiment as a matter of national pride, his overall attitude is more complex, as R. Scheindlin and R. Brann have shown.30 Those scholars worked primarily with Kitib al-Muhddara, in which Ibn Ezra uses Arabic poetics as an absolute literary yardstick appli- cable even to Scripture, a view that has led some modern authors to accuse him of "assimilationism" in comparison with more nationalistic Hebraists like Judah Halevi.31 From the vantage point of his own detailed study of Maqcilat al- Hadiqa, Fenton might have explored Ibn Ezra's tacit acceptance of 'arabiyya further. Another tension that merits further study is Ibn Ezra's attitude towards Karaite thought. As a Rabbanite Jew, he nominally rejects the motto attributed 29Maqalat al-IHadiqa 236; Kitab al-Muhadara 74a (Fenton, p. 377n). 30 R. Scheindlin, "Rabbi Moshe Ibn Ezra on the Legitimacy of Poetry," Medievalia et Humanistica 7 (1976) 101-115; R. Brann, The Compunctious Poet (Ithaca, 1991), pp. 16-17; 69-71. 31 For references, see Brann, Compunctious Poet, p. 16n.</page><page sequence="10">542 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to 'Anan, to "examine Scripture diligently and do not rely upon my view" (Maqailat al-IHadiqa 63), which grants every reader of Scripture inde- pendence from earlier, that is, rabbinic, tradition. This maxim encapsulates the ideology of peshat exegesis, which employs scientific linguistic analy- sis rather than the methods of midrash.32 This motto characterizes Ibn Ezra's exegesis as well, since the very intellectual freedom it implies allows for his novel interpretations, his rejection of rabbinic readings (as noted by Fenton at pp. 257-258; 318-321; 362; 379), and his project of interpreting Scripture through the prism of Arabic poetics. Ibn Ezra thus tacitly accepts an axiom of Karaite exegetical methodology, and it would be interesting to explore how he reconciles this acceptance with his Rabbanite allegiance.33 But since Fenton does not cite Ibn Ezra's rejection of 'Anan's motto, he is not compelled to address the conflict it created.34 One way to do so would be to explore Ibn Ezra's use of rabbinic exegesis35 and how he re- lates it to his philological-historical method, as H. Shy, for example, has done for Tanhum ha-Yerushalmi.36 Ibn Ezra's attitudes on this matter might shed light on later more explicit attempts by Abraham Ibn Ezra and David Kimhi to define the peshat-derash dichotomy. 32 On this so-called "scripturalism" within the Karaite school, and the motto attrib- uted to 'Anan (which may actually be a later development), see H. Ben-Shammai, "The Karaite Controversy: Scripture and Tradition in Early Karaism," in Religionsgespache im Mittelalter, eds. B. Lewis and F Niewohner (Wiesbaden, 1992), pp. 13-24; M. Pol- liack, "The Emergence of Karaite Biblical Exegesis" (Hebrew), Sefunot n.s. 7 (1999) 302-31 1; D. Frank, "Karaite Exegesis," HBOT, p. 112. 33 It is interesting to consider whether Moses Ibn Ezra himself used Karaite exe- gesis. The mere fact that he criticized the Karaites does not exclude this possibility. Abraham Ibn Ezra, for example, did both; see E. Z. Melammed, Bible Commentators (in Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1978), pp. 676-678. Moses Ibn Ezra cites Karaite scholars very rarely, primarily for polemical purposes (see, e.g., Fenton, p. 288). Fenton occasion- ally raises the possibility that he used Karaite scholarship without attribution (see, e.g., pp. 306-308), but he does not reach a definite conclusion. 34The reference to 'Anan alone appears in the list of "authors cited in Maqalat al-Hadiqa" in appendix II (p. 405). 35 Fenton (pp. 136, 320) does show that Ibn Ezra seized opportunities to cite rab- binic literature to support his readings. Of special interest are cases in which he finds precedents for rhetorical figures in rabbinic literature (see, e.g., pp. 337-338). To the examples that Fenton cites, we can add Ibn Ezra's citation (Maqalat al-Hadiqa 251) of "the derash" (with no further reference) on Exod 32:6 that "they arose to play (pn?5)" refers to sexual activity, an explanation he seems to accept, classifying it as an example of euphemism (kinaya; see below). By contrast, Ibn Janah (Kitab al-Usuil, s.v. p-n-s) takes this term literally. 36 Tanhum Ha-Yerushalmi's Commentary on the Minor Prophets: A Critical Edi- tion with an Introduction, Translated into Hebrew and Annotated (Jerusalem, 1991), pp. xxvii-xxx.</page><page sequence="11">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 543 3. AESTHETIC EXEGESIS Ibn Ezra develops his aesthetic exegesis most fully in Kitdb al-Muhai- dara, where he seeks precedents in Scripture for twenty Arabic poetic orna- ments.37 In that work he cites biblical examples of literary devices such as metaphor, simile, hyperbole, ellipsis and word plays, not to interpret them, but simply to demonstrate Scripture's poetic quality. Maqillat al-IHadiqa, on the other hand, is devoted to interpretation, to getting at Scripture's true meaning (4aqiqa), which its majaz expressions conceal. The two works re- flect distinct streams of Arabic learning: Maqalat al-.Hadiqa parallels qur- 'anic exegesis (Fenton, pp. 258-266); Kitab al-Muhaidara draws on Arabic poetics, particularly works devised to define the ornate, so-called badi' (lit. new) style of poetry.38 Accordingly, in Kitab al-Muhaidara the twenty poetic ornaments are classified under the title badi', whereas many of the same ornaments are presented as subtypes of majaz in Maqalat al-IHadiqa. The uniqueness of Kitab al-Muhazdara stems from the fact that Jewish authors did not participate in badi'-inspired scholarship. By comparison, Maqdlat al-IHadiqa is essentially a traditional Jewish work, because the majaz-haqiqa dichotomy, originally applied in qur'anic exegesis, had been embraced by Jewish exegetes in Muslim lands since the 9th century. Yet, as Fenton (pp. 332-341) indicates, Ibn Ezra maintained his unique poetic per- spective in Maqdlat al-IHadiqa, which is replete with references to Scripture's aesthetic qualities and poetic techniques. Fenton describes twelve major sub- categories of majaz featured in Maqdlat al-IHadiqa, listed here with his French translations: Al-majaiz ad-dariiri La me'taphore categorique Al-majfz ar-rtihani La metaphore spirituelle IstiQdra La metaphore Ta?bih La comparison Ghuluww, Ighraq L'hyperbole Ighail L'hyperbole finale Mubalagha L'exageration Badal al-mujdawara La metonymie par association Badal al-guz' min al-kull Hypallage ou la substitution d'une partie pour la toute Maqliib L'inversion Kinaiya Synecdoque Idmdr L'ellipse 37 See Fenton, p. 299; M.

For example, we read in a num- ber of places that Ibn Ezra points to the literary excellence of specific verses: "Death and life are in the hand of the tongue" (Prov 18:21) is a "wondrous metaphor" (isti'ira 'ajiba; p. 333); "your neck is like an ivory tower" (Song 7:5) is "a beautiful simile" (husn at-ta?bih; p. 334); "like a scarlet thread are your lips" (Song 4:3) is a model of "succinctness and eloquence" (ijaz wa- fasaha; p. 340).40 But Fenton does not attempt to explain the literary criteria for Ibn Ezra's judgments, a task one could reasonably perform in light of the literary standards set in Kitab al-Muhadara and perhaps the lines of Hebrew and Arabic poetry adduced in Maqalat al-IHadiqa (listed in appendices III and IV).41 Indeed, Fenton's relatively brief treatment of Ibn Ezra's aesthetic exegesis does not meet the same high standard he sets in the other two areas, to which he devotes the bulk of the second section of his book. Without fault- ing the author for choosing his emphases, the remainder of this essay re- flects my own interest in attempting to add further clarification to the literary techniques Fenton identifies in Maqalat al-IHadiqa. In my opinion, this step is necessary for rightly assessing Ibn Ezra's place in the exegetical tradition, since his aesthetic exegesis represents his unique contribution, as opposed to his typically Andalusian philosophical and philological exegesis. Moreover, as Fenton notes, Ibn Ezra's work can be viewed as a "precursor of modern literary criticism of Scripture" (p. 237), a reason for contemporary readers to take special interest in his poetic perspective on biblical interpretation.42 39Fenton (p. 340) also briefly lists another six subtypes of majaz mentioned in Maq,alat al-Hadiqa that can be viewed as literary embellishments, although they do not correspond to specific poetic techniques listed in Kitab al Muh.ddara. 40 See Fenton, p. 341, for other examples, including a list (n. 309) of references to fasaha in Maqalat al-Hadiqa. 41 As done on a smaller scale, e.g., by A. Schippers, Spanish Hebrew Poetry, pp. 37- 39. To explain Ibn Ezra's praise for Song 4:3, one might turn to the discussion of this verse in Kitab al-Muhadara; see M. Cohen, "Aesthetic Exegesis," p. 289. 42 Fenton's list of three works that illustrate this trend, we should add some other basic references. One important work is The Literary Guide to the Bible, eds. R. Alter and F Kermode (Cambridge MA, 1987). In addition, many introductions to the Bible now include sections on the literary approach, with bibliographies. E.g., C. E. Hauer and W. A. Young, Introduction to the Bible: A Journey into Three Worlds (Upper</page><page sequence="13">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 545 Metaphor A glance at Fenton's list of literary techniques in Maqdlat al-IHadiqa reveals that he uses "metaphore" to render two terms: majaz and isti'dra. But only the latter properly denotes metaphor, whereas majaz is a broader category for designating language that deviates from normal semantic, syn- tactic, or grammatical usage.43 True, Fenton follows other scholars who have rendered majaz as metaphor, most notably M. Zucker; but H. Ben-Shammai has shown this to be an incorrect translation.44 This distinction may be less than crucial in discussing philosophical and philological exegesis, since the labels majaz and istii'ra both connote non-haqiqa language, which requires reinterpretation. But an attempt to explore Ibn Ezra's aesthetic exegesis requires greater precision in rendering his literary categories.45 Thus it is Saddle River NJ, 1998), pp. 389-391, lists over thirty books that illustrate "the ex- plosion of works that reflect the new literary approaches to the Bible." Instead of re- lying on Konig's 1990 work, "the first rhetorical analysis of Bible" (Fenton, p. 238n), we might compare Ibn Ezra with more up-to-date studies on biblical stylistics such as L. Alonso Schockel, A Manual of Hebrew Poetics (Rome, 1988) and W. G. E. Wat- son, Classical Hebrew Poetry: A Guide to Its Techniques, 2nd ed. (Sheffield, 1986). The modern literary approach to Scripture has generated new interest in its medieval precursors; see, e.g., J. Kugel, The Idea of Biblical Poetry (New Haven, 1981); A. Ber- lin, Biblical Poetry Through Medieval Jewish Eyes (Bloomington, 1991). In a more recent essay, Berlin observes that modern literary theory, by virtue of its inherent plu- rality, has made the academic world more receptive than ever before to premodern studies of biblical literature; see A. Berlin, "On the Use of Traditional Jewish Exege- sis in the Modern Literary Study of the Bible," in Tehillah le-Mosheh: Biblical and Judaic Studies in Honor of Moshe Greenberg, eds. M. Cogan, B. Eichler, J. Tigay (Winona Lake IN, 1997), pp. 173-183. 43 Fenton admits this in a footnote (p. 259, n. 63), in which he explains that his translation of majaz as "metaphore" is for the sake of convenience (commodite') and that, in fact, "this term signified any semantic deviation from the normal usage of the word." Medieval Hebrew translators (e.g., Judah Ibn Tibbon and his son, Samuel) rendered majaz as ha'avarah (lit. going beyond, i.e., beyond the literal sense; see be- low, n. 46) and reserved hash'alah (lit. borrowing, i.e., metaphor) specifically for isti'ara; see Cohen, Three Approaches, pp. 42n, 98n, 137n. For an overview of the definition of majaz in Arabic literature, see EI, s.v. See also W. Heinrichs, "On the Genesis of the .Haqiqa-Majaz Dichotomy," Studia Islamica 59 (1984) 112-140. 44"Saadya's Introduction to Isaiah" (Hebrew), Tarbiz 60 (1990) 381. Fenton (p. 273) actually cites Zucker's translation of a key passage in Sa'adia about majaz and adopts his translation of this term as "sens metaphorique." 45 At times, Fenton must render majaiz more broadly as "figurative language," e.g., when faced with a subcategory of majaz clearly unrelated to metaphor such as in- version (maqliib; p. 337), or the compound expression isti'ara majaziyya, which he</page><page sequence="14">546 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW best to reserve the term metaphor for isti'dra alone and translate majaz as unusual or non-literal language. 46 If Fenton had formulated and observed this rule of translation he could have cleared up a confusion in Philosophie et exege'se that may plague readers interested in the theory of metaphor. Not only was metaphor, that is, is- ti'ara, celebrated in Arabic poetics as the basis of the badi' style,47 it is also viewed in modern literary studies as the fundamental ingredient of poetry.48 And as a special linguistic phenomenon, it has attracted attention recently in philosophy and psychology. 49 Readers from all of these fields understand- ably might turn to Philosophie et exege'se dans le Jardin de la metaphore de Moise Ibn 'Ezra for an in-depth study of metaphor.50 Indeed, "metaphore" is the largest entry in the subject index (pp. 454-455), corresponding to dozens of excerpts and citations from Maqalat al-IHadiqa. What readers will not realize-unless they consult the original Judeo-Arabic text-is that most of these references are to Ibn Ezra's discussions of majaz, not isti'dra.51 renders "metaphore figuree" (p. 333). As a result, Fenton's translation of majaz is inconsistent and confusing, at times gratuitously so. E.g., on p. 302, in translating a key passage in Maqalat al-Hadiqa on the definition of majaz (in contrast to haqiqa), Fenton renders it alternatively as "le sens figure" and "la metaphore" I "sens meta- phorique," giving the reader the false impression that Ibn Ezra here alternates his ter- minology. In his dissertation, Fenton was more careful to translate majaz consistently as "le sens figure" (e.g., on pp. 83, 238-245), and reserve the French term "m'ta- phore" for isti'dra (e.g., on pp. 244, 247, 250, 251). 46 This translation is more inclusive than "figurative language." W. Heinrichs, The Hand of the Northwind: Opinions on Metaphor and the Early Meaning of Isti'ara in Arabic Poetics (Wiesbaden, 1977), pp. 18, 45, 63, renders majaz as "that which goes beyond the proper meaning and use of words," in an attempt to reflect the literal sense of this Arabic term ("to pass," or "to go beyond"). 47 As Fenton, on pp. 299-300, notes; see also below, n. 67. 48 A view well represented in literary studies of Scripture; see M. Weiss, The Bible from Within (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 130-240, which includes references to general literary theory; Alonso Schokel, Manual of Poetics, pp. 95-141; Watson, Classical Hebrew Poetry, pp. 263-272; R. Alter, The Art of Biblical Poetry (New York, 1985), pp. 185-203. 49 See, e.g., A. Ortony, ed., Metaphor and Thought (London, 1993) and numerous references cited there. 50 J. Stern, e.g., in his Metaphor in Context (Boston, 2000), writing from the per- spective of the philosophy of language, mentions Ibn Ezra's Maqalat al-Hadiqa and cites Philosophie et exegese in a footnote (p. 355). 51 As it turns out, Philosophie et exegese contains only a very minimal treatment of isti'ara, nine lines on p. 333. Nowhere else in the book is isti'dra discussed. The sections on "me'taphore cate'gorique" (al-majaz ad-daruiri; p. 332) and "mcttaphore spirituelle" (al-maj]z ar-riihani; p. 333) are not about isti'ara. Likewise, Ibn Ezra's lengthy theoretical discussion in Maqalat al-Hadiqa 27-30 (cited in Fenton, pp. 302-</page><page sequence="15">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 547 Given Ibn Ezra's exceptional poetic perspective, it is not surprising that he does, in fact, have much to say about metaphor proper. In Kitab al- Muhadara, he boldly drew upon Arabic literary theory to introduce a concep- tion of metaphor unique in Jewish tradition.52 Though Ibn Ezra was hardly alone in using the term isti'dra (literally, "lending or borrowing"; compare the Hebrew translation, hash'alah) to denote metaphor, he did offer a strik- ing alternative to the better-known traditional concept of this literary tech- nique in Judeo-Arabic literature. Ibn Janah, for example, uses the term isti'iira in a manner defined by Ibn Qutayba (d. 889) in Ta'wil muskil al- Qur'an (Interpretation of the Difficult in the Qur'an): The Arabs "borrow" (tasta'iru) one word and then put it in the place of another word, provided the thing named by it (i.e., the first word) is related causally to the other one, or adjacent to it or similar [to it].53 Accordingly, Ibn Janah frequently speaks of BH words "borrowed" to be used in a new sense. 5 A similar model is attested in Maimonides, who uses the term isti'dra as defined by al-Farabi,55 who himself adapted Aristotle's 304) supposedly devoted to "la metaphore" turns out to be about majdz, not isti'ara. Sometimes other factors account for the term me'taphore in Fenton's translation with- out a basis in the Arabic text. E.g., on p. 300, he refers to Ibn Ezra's supposed re- sponse to critics of metaphor (". . . je fais peu des cas de l 'opposition rependue parmi nos docteurs et nos legistes contemporains contre la metaphore"). But in that text (from Kitab al-MuhMdara 1 19b), Ibn Ezra mentions neither isti'ira nor majkz; he is simply defending his citation of qur'anic material. Fenton (see p. 301n) seems to have relied on the (incorrect) interpolation of metaphor into that passage by R. Brann, Compunc- tious Poet, pp. 79-83. This is surprising because elsewhere (p. 346) Fenton translates the same passage without the interpolation ("Comme je viens de citer le Coran des Arabes, je n'ai pas fait cas de 1 'austirite stupide que les hypocrites parmi les juristes coreligionnaires ont adopte'e a notre e'poque"). 52 See M. Cohen, "Moses Ibn Ezra vs. Maimonides: Argument for a Poetic Defini- tion of Metaphor (Isti'ara)," Edebiydt: Journal of Middle Eastern and Comparative Literature 11 (2000) 1-28. 53 Heinrichs, Hand of the Northwind, p. 30. 54See, e.g., Kitab al-Usiul, s.v., oni ,ovy ,:vv ,nr; Kitab al-Luma' 315 (Sefer ha- Riqmah 331); see also W. Bacher, Leben und Werke des Abulwalid Merwan Ibn Ga- nah (Budapest, 1889), p. 31n. 55 The Farabian model of isti'ira is well attested in Maimonides' Guide of the Per- plexed; see M. Cohen, "Logic to Interpretation: Maimonides' Use of Al-Farabi's Notion of Metaphor," Zutot: Perspectives on Jewish Culture 2 (2002) 104-113; idem, Three Approaches, pp. 100-118, 213. Even more strikingly, a definition of isti'ara al- most identical to al-Farabi's appears in The Treatise on Logic, a work traditionally at- tributed to Maimonides; see Cohen, "Poetic Definition," pp. 4-6, 10-13. Recently, however, H. Davidson has challenged the attribution of the Treatise on Logic to Mai- monides; see his essay, "The Authenticity of Works Attributed to Maimonides," Me'ah</page><page sequence="16">548 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW notion that "metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else."56 According to this model, isti'dra means temporarily "bor- rowing," or "transferring" (the literal sense of Greek metaphora), a word that normally "belongs" to one thing and using it to designate something else. The commonly cited example of this "name transfer" is the term "lion" (Ar. asad) used to denote a courageous man. 5 Ibn Ezra works with a different type of "borrowing" in the chapter he de- votes to isti'dra in Kitab al-Muhadara, as we see in his analysis of a line of verse by the Umayyad poet Dhui r-Rumma, She stayed there until the stalks withered in the soil and the dawn in its white gown drove away the Pleiades.58 Ibn Ezra comments: He lent (fa-sta'ara) a gown to the dawn though it has no gown. (Kitab al-Muhadara 121a)59 Ibn Ezra does not tell us that the expression "white gown" has a new mean- ing; he simply observes that the poet lent a gown to the dawn. W. Heinrichs calls this "imaginary ascription," a conception of isti'tra . .. [that] does not consist in "borrowing" a name from its original "owner" and transferring it to a new one . .. on the contrary, She'arim: Studies in Medieval Jewish Spiritual Life in Memory of Isadore Twersky, eds., E.

On Maimonides' overall debt to al-Farabi's linguistic notions, see A. Hyman, "Maimonides on Religious Lan- guage," Perspectives on Maimonides, ed. J. L. Kraemer (New York, 1991), pp. 177-179. 56Poetics 1457b; PEPP, s.v. "Metaphor." Al-FarabI and Ibn Qutayba represent two branches of Arabic learning (the so-called logical tradition and the tradition of qur'anic hermeneutics) that were normally quite distinct; see W. Heinrichs, "Literary Theory: The Problem of Its Efficiency," Arabic Poetry: Theory and Development, ed. G. E. von Grunebaum (Wiesbaden, 1973), pp. 30-33. It is conceivable, however, that their shared conception of isti'ara reflects some mutual influence; see Cohen, pp. 10- 13, 21-22. 57 See "Maimonides' Arabic Treatise on Logic: Maqala ft $ind'at al-Mantiq," ed.

This construction prompted the typical for- mulas in Arabic literary criticism: "the poet lent A to B" and "B has no A," both used by Ibn Ezra in the gloss of Dhiu r-Rumma's verse above. Imagi- nary ascription also guided him when devising his list of forty biblical examples of isti'dra (Kitab al-Muhadara 119a-b), all in the genitive con- struction. This list includes isti'drat that do not readily lend themselves to Aristotelian analysis, for example, lnrr) 5' ("the dew of your youth"), vn11 nlYWn ("the helmet of salvation"), and nv )o)z ("the wings of the dawn"). Ibn Ezra does not attempt to tell us what these metaphors "really mean"; in fact, he gives no explanations for them whatsoever, relying on his reader to supply the implied gloss, "Scripture lent A to B, though B has no A." Name transfer depends on an implicit simile: Y can borrow the term "x," which normally denotes X, because X is like Y62 For example, the simile, "a courageous man is like a lion" allows us to substitute the term "lion" for "a courageous man." But in Ibn Ezra's type of isti'dra, A is attributed to B, not compared with it.63 This model is based on what Arab theorists call a tam- thYl, a broader analogy between the new recipient and implied original owner of the borrowed thing. 64 In Ibn Ezra's examples, Scripture imagines the dawn as a bird with wings (mnv salvation as a helmet-clad warrior (v31 nlYWM), and youth as the morning accompanied by pleasant dew (In5)t 5,). The Aristotelian metaphor is a new name for an existing entity and is therefore well suited for interpretation: it can be decoded by identifying "that second entity," the Y that borrowed the word originally assigned to X. Qur'anic exegetes such as Ibn Qutayba, followed by their Jewish counter- parts, thus classified isti'ara as a type of majaz and analyzed it by seeking its underlying haqiqa (see above, p. 537).65 But imaginary ascription is not just a creative use of language; it is a mental process that frees the poet from the bounds of empirical reality and allows him to create new entities in his 60 Heinrichs, Hand of the Northwind, p. 9. 61 See Heinrichs, "Isti'drah and Badi'," p. 190. 62This condition is included in Ibn Qutayba's definition of isti'ara; see also Hein- richs, Hand of the Northwind, p. 22. In Aristotle's work, metaphor and simile are linked; see PEPP, pp. 490-491. 63 This explains why early Arabic works on poetics did not link isti'ara and simile (Ar. ta?bih); see Heinrichs, "Isti'arah and Badi'," p. 182. 64 Heinrichs, Hand of the Northwind, pp. 6-8; see also above, n. 23. 65 See Heinrichs, Hand of the Northwind, pp. 14, 31, 41-42; Cohen, Three Ap- proaches, pp. 64-65.</page><page sequence="18">550 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW imagination, a process described in a famous passage by the English poet Sir Philip Sidney (1554-89): Only the poet, disdaining to be tied to any such subjection [to nature], lifted up with the vigour of his own invention, doth grow in effect an- other nature, in making things either better than nature bringeth forth, or, quite anew, forms such as never were in nature ... so as he goeth hand in hand with nature, not enclosed within the narrow warrant of her gifts, but freely ranging only within the zodiac of his own wit.66 This creativity was celebrated by Arab adherents of the fanciful badi' style, of which isti'tra was a key element.67 But it frustrated rational-minded authors, as we can perhaps see from a colorful anecdote about the poet Abiu Tammam. In response to the clever metaphor "water of reproach" (ma' a-l- malamati) that he devised, one of his mockers sent to him a bottle and said: "Put herein some water of reproach." Abii Tammam answered him: "If you send me a feather of the 'wing of humility,' then I will send you some water of reproach."68 Instead of divulging the haqiqa of his metaphor, the poet dismisses such analysis by citing the completely imaginary qur'anic "wing of humility." In Kitdb al-Muhadara, Ibn Ezra likewise mentions unnamed rational- minded authors who eschewed isti'dra and responds by noting the poetic beauty of this creative technique.69 He also invokes an imposing biblical precedent by devising his list of forty biblical isti'trat, much as Arab authors defended the badi' style by turning to qur'anic precedents. Since Ibn Ezra's intent is to validate the license of poets to fabricate imaginary scenes, it is not surprising that many of the metaphors he cites cannot readily be translated into haqiqa. What, for example, are the "helmet of salvation," "wings of the dawn" and "dew of youth"?70 When addressing such meta- 66 "The Defence of Poesy," The Oxford Authors: Sir Philip Sidney, ed. K. Duncan- Jones (Oxford, 1989), p. 216; see also Cohen, "Poetic Definition," pp. 15-16. 67 In early Arabic treatises on poetics, the term badi' itself referred primarily to the imaginary ascription type of isti'ara; see Heinrichs, "Isti'ara and Badi'," pp. 190-200, 202-204. 68 A. Schippers, "The Genitive-Metaphor in the Poetry of 'Abu-Tammam," Pro- ceedings of the Ninth Congress of the Union Eropeene Des Arabisants et Islamisants (Leiden, 1981), p. 258. 69 Kitab al-Muhadara 118b-1 19a; see Cohen, "Poetic Definition," p. 3. 70To be sure, a haqiqa can be found for some genitive metaphors. For example, l1it ozx ("mother of the road") means a fork in the road; inolvx ?zi ("sons of his quiver") are arrows. The type of genitive metaphor without a haqiqa was termed by</page><page sequence="19">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 551 phors, badi' inspired Arab critics would instead explore the fanciful com- binations they imply.7' It was this analytic mode Ibn Ezra applied to Dhiu r-Rumma's isti'ara, as he does to a line of verse by Ibn Gabirol.72 These explicit commentaries suggest that he would similarly analyze the biblical metaphors he lists, although, as mentioned above, they are presented in Ki- tab al-Muhadara without any elucidation. Now we can see the importance of tracing Ibn Ezra's treatment of is- ti'dra in his exegetical work, an investigation that can offer answers to the following questions: Does the poetic analysis implied in Kitab al-Muhadara find its expression in Maqalat al-IHadiqa? And, if so, how does it contrib- ute to Ibn Ezra's exegesis and appreciation of Scripture's poetic qualities? I hope to address these questions more fully elsewhere, but for now we can at least explain the issues they raise and suggest the outlines of likely answers. While we might expect consistency from a single author, we must recognize that his two works have different goals and flow from different streams of Arabic and Jewish learning (see above, p. 543). And indeed, the exegetical focus of Maqdlat al-IHadiqa and the tradition it draws on dictated that Ibn Ezra treat metaphor as a type of majaz and seek its haqlqa according to the name transfer model. Yet at times his poetic interests emerge, revealed as he applies instead the imaginary ascription model, by noting how Scripture poetically lends elements from one realm of reality to another.73 A study of isti'dra in Maqdlat al-IHadiqa can thus be used as a gauge for measuring Ibn Ezra's success in integrating a poetic perspective into his interpretation of Scripture. Metonymy Closely related to metaphor is the concept of metonymy, which is well attested in Maqdlat al-IHadiqa, where it is referred to alternatively as badal (lit. substitution), mujawara (lit. proximity), and kindya (lit. naming). Ibn Ezra defines metonymy as "one thing being called by the name of another that is closely related to it (mujawiran lahu)."74 For example, 1ip (horn) in some Arab theorists as isti'ara takhyiliya, an imaginative or make-believe metaphor; see Heinrichs, Hand of the Northwind, p. 14. 71 See Heinrichs, "Isti'drah and Badi'," pp. 193-198; Cohen, "Poetic Definition," pp. 15-17. 72Kitab al-Muhadara 121b; see Cohen, "Poetic Definition," pp. 7-8. 73 Ibn Ezra also lays emphasis on the imaginative possibilities opened by biblical tamthilat, i.e., analogies that generate imaginary ascription isti'drat (above, nn. 23, 64). 74n x ))o5x I:)' ,,mt v otvci 7 nv )v5x jx:)i; Maqailat al-Hadhqa 253, cited by Fenton, pp. 320, 338.

'aql) and "blood of grapes" for wine. 76 In light of our discussion of isti'ara, we can now see that Ibn Ezra uses the terms badal, mujdwara, and kindya specifi- cally to denote the name transfer model of metaphor. In fact, his definition of metonymy matches Ibn Qutayba's definition of isti'dra.77 Interestingly, some examples of isti'dra cited in Kitab al-Muhddara are classified as metonymy in Maqdlat al-IHadiqa, implying a philological-exegetical, rather than poetic, analysis. In Maqdlat al-Hadiqa 189, for instance, Ibn Ezra comments that the "the doors of his face" (i)n )n5r; Job 41:6) means the lips by way of metonymy (mxnowv5 xv n ); but this same expression is cited in Kitdb al- Muuhadara as one of the forty examples of isti'dra, implying that Scripture poetically "lent" doors to a face, as though it were a house.78 Though Ibn Ezra uses the terms badal, mujawara, and kiniya practically interchangeably, Fenton confuses matters by assigning specific translations to each (see above, p. 543). His translation of badal as "metonymy" is fine, but kindya is not "synecdoche." Synecdoche (i.e., calling a part by the name of the whole or vice versa), a type of metonymy, is what Ibn Ezra has in mind when speaking of badal al-juz' min al-kull ("substitution of part for the whole"; e.g., nvrwv Iimx means a person who listens [MS 179]), a figural category that Fenton lists separately (pp. 336-337). Evidently Fenton rec- ognizes that "synecdoche" does not always fit Ibn Ezra's use of the term ki- ndya, and so renders it "euphemisme" when discussing actual examples.79 But even that translation is too narrow, since kinaya does not always involve euphemism. 80 It is preferable to view badal, kindya, and mujawara together under the rubric of metonymy,81 after which it is helpful to specify the no- tions of synecdoche and euphemism that Ibn Ezra at times expresses. Indeed, as Fenton (p. 338) shows, the notion of euphemism is critical for understanding why Scripture uses metonymy. As Ibn Ezra explains, this tech- 75Maqalat al-IHadiqa 155; Fenton, pp. 335-336. Ibn Ezra goes on to cite Lam 2:10 ("They put dust on their heads") to show that this was a practice of mourning. 76 These examples, cited by Fenton, p. 338, are from Maqalat al-.Hadiqa 125 and 138 respectively. (Fenton's reference to 135 must be corrected.) 77 Derivatives of the term badal (ibdal and tabdil; lit. "substitution") were actually used in the Arab Aristotelian school (e.g., by Averroes) interchangeably with isti'&lt;ra to denote metaphor; see D. Black, Logic and Aristotle's Rhetoric and Poetics in Me- dieval Arabic Philosophy (Leiden, 1990), p. 243. 78 For another example, see below, n. 84. 79E.g., on p. 338; there Fenton evidently intends to differentiate between kindya and mujawara, which he renders "metonymy." 80On kinaya in Arabic poetics, see El, s.v.; see also below n. 82. 81 Fenton's choice to place maqliub (p. 337) between his discussion of badal and kinaya is especially confusing.</page><page sequence="21">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 553 nique is made necessary by the paucity of the Hebrew vocabulary for sexual organs and activities. This quality of "our distinguished [Hebrew] language and pure tongue" (irm xn vii)t') n-'15 5 min5)), he explains, forces He- brew to resort to what the Rabbis call lrrp) pvO ("clean language"), or euphe- mism (Maqdlat al-IHadqa 250). 82 For example: "Your navel is [like] a round cup" (Song 7:3) refers to the sexual or- gan, designated by the term navel that is related to it metonymically (mujawiran lahu; lit., neighboring it), as we have explained in con- nection with other organs spoken of metonymically (al-mutajawira).83 This feature of Hebrew, he argues, justifies its label as "the holy tongue" (wvnpni pvO), the same distinctive explanation for this epithet that Maimo- nides would later adopt (see above, p. 539). While metonymy can sometimes be attributed to linguistic necessity, Ibn Ezra hints at another possible motive in an entry not atypical in Maqilat al-IHadiqa: The majaz expressions for manna [include]: "and the grain of heaven (2)OV )pi)84 he gave to them," for it was a substitute for grain. It is also called "bread of heaven" (o)ov on4). All of these are eloquent metonymies (kindyatfahlia).85 As Fenton (pp. 340-341) observes, Ibn Ezra's use of the termfasih86 in this context implies that a desire for literary elegance motivates Scripture's choice to use a metonymic majaz expression rather than the proper term "manna." Not surprisingly, metonymy played a critical role in the linguistic tradition Maqdlat al-IHadiqa represents. Most notably, Ibn Janah devoted a lengthy chapter of his comprehensive work on Biblical Hebrew (Kitdb al-Luma', chap. 27; Riqmah, chap. 28) to "a word used in the sense of another," a prin- ciple he applies to numerous biblical examples. His liberal stance was criti- cized by later authors, most notably by Abraham Ibn Ezra, who consigned 82n1XA) X )DX N5NH)X -):,n o1 w1)OVnDD &gt;)N r]') f(Fen- ton here translates kiniya as "euphemism" and mujawara as "metonymy.") 83Maqdlat al-.Hadiqa 253.

Here Ibn Ezra labels it as kinaya; see above, n. 78. 85Maqdlat al-Hadiqa 137. 86 On the use of this term, which properly means pure or correct language, in the sense of literary elegance, see E. Goldenberg, "On the 'Egron of Se'adya Ga'on" (Hebrew), Leshonenu 37 (1972/3) 122. This sense is attested, e.g., in Ibn Janah, Kitab al-Luma' 289 (Riqmah 303).

Perez,89 who defines a middle position devised by Moses Ibn Gikatilla (and adopted by Abraham Ibn Ezra) that accurately portrays the balance Moses Ibn Ezra struck: he applies badal pri- marily where it can be justified in literary or stylistic terms (i.e., as fa-saha or rwp) pv5), that is to say, when he can explain why a biblical author chose to use one word in the sense of another.90 Hyperbole, Poetic Fancy, Emphasis In celebrating the imagination, Arabic poetics emphasized the importance of hyperbole, a literary technique referred to alternatively as ghuluww, igh- raq, ighal, and mubalagha.91 Ibn Ezra devotes two of his twenty chapters 87 Fenton (p. 336, n. 290) cites "Proven9al exegetes" who referred to the exegeti- cal strategy of badal as ji5)n. Although this is how Abraham Ibn Ezra and others referred to it, Ibn Janah himself never actually characterized his method as badal, which he reserved for another use (see below, n. 89); see M. Perez, "Substitution of One Word for Another as an Exegetical Method Used by Medieval Scholars" [He- brew], in Studies in Bible Exegesis, ed. U. Simon (Ramat Gan, 1986) 2:207-228. On Abraham Ibn Ezra's view, see U. Simon, "Who Was the Proponent of Lexical Sub- stitution Whom Ibn Ezra Denounced as a Prater and Madman?" The Frank Talmage Memorial, ed. B. Walfish (Haifa, 1993), 1:217-232. 88 Kitab al-Muhadara 134b; see Cohen, "Aesthetic Exegesis," p. 286n. 89 Perez, "Substitution" (above, n. 87), an article which Fenton, surprisingly, does not mention. Instead, he refers (p. 336, n. 290) to J. Derenbourg, Opuscules et traites D'Abou'l-walid Merwan Ibn Djanah (Paris, 1880), p. xcvi, whose discussion of "sub- stitution d'un mot a un autre," based on the above-mentioned chapter of Kitib al- Luma', is helpful but outdated. In the same note, Fenton refers to Luma' 99 (chapter eight); but Ibn Janah. uses the term badal there in the sense of apposition, not metonymy. 90 This pattern of selectivity may explain why Moses Ibn Ezra only rarely uses the term badal by itself (see, e.g., Maqalat al-Hadiqa 135, 160, 174); it is usually accom- panied by the term mujawara (see references in Fenton, p. 336, n. 288), which im- plies an association between the two terms that justifies the substitution. 91 These terms are often used interchangeable in Arabic literary criticism; see EI 7:277, s.v., "Mubdlagha." It is not clear whether Fenton intended to distinguish between ghuluww and mubalagha by rendering one "hyperbole" and the other "exageration" (see above, p. 543). In the course of citing examples, he translates all four terms as "hyperbole et exageration" (pp. 334-335). On p. 334, n. 277, Fenton states that He- brew orn was used by later "Provencal" exegetes-presumably Radak-to denote hy- perbole. The correct term is xnvi), to which we can add n5orn (see Melammed, Bible</page><page sequence="23">A POET'S BIBLICAL EXEGESIS-COHEN 555 on the poetic ornaments in Kitcb al-Muhi.dclara to these techniques, which he defines as depictions that "exceed the domain of the possible and enter the domain of the impossible."92 In Maqdlat al-Hadiqa, as Fenton (pp. 334- 335) documents, Ibn Ezra notes many biblical examples of these techniques, such as the wise counsel "A gentle tongue can break bones" (Prov 25:15), and Joel's description of the locusts "with teeth like teeth of a lion / with the fangs of a lion's breed" (Joel 1:6).93 Ibn Ezra records (Kitab al-MuhMdara 1 37b) that the Rabbis disparagingly called hyperbole Twil IiO ("vain talk"), but he emphasizes the usefulness of this literary strategy in making pro- phetic rhetoric most effective. In so doing, he alludes to an earlier discus- sion (Kitab al-Muhadcara 62a) on the propriety of using hyperbole in poetry in general. While some literary critics, Ibn Ezra notes, disparaged hyperbole because of its inherent "falsehood," the majority maintained that it adds ele- gance, lends power to poetic imagery, and sharpens literary depiction in the spirit of the motto, "the best of poetry is its most false," viz., its most hyper- bolic and fanciful. 94 This parallel between Ibn Ezra's discussion of the role of hyperbole in poetry and prophetic rhetoric illustrates how he applies his literary perspective to Scripture.95 In addition to the usual sense of hyperbole, the term mubalagha also had a more technical usage in Ibn Ezra's poetics, which reveals the fundamental nature of this technique in his thinking. Following Arab experts on poetry such as Qudama b. Ja'far and al-Hatimi, Ibn Ezra defines this technique as a Commentators, pp. 859-861); orn means threat, not hyperbole; see Radak on Amos 4:4 and E. Ben-Yehuda, A Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew (New York, 1960), s.v. oDt. 92This is the definition of ighal in Kitab al-Muhadara 137b; the English transla- tion is from Y. Mashiah, "The Terminology of Hebrew Prosody and Rhetoric with Spe- cial Reference to Arabic Origins" (Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 1972), p. 168. In Kitab al-Muhadara 62a, Ibn Ezra offers an almost identical definition for ighraq and mubalagha taken from the Arab literary critic Qudama b. Jalfar, on which, see Mashiah, p. 164. 93 Ibn Ezra labels the first example as ghuluww and ighrdq (Maqalat al-IHadiqa 196) and the second as ghuluww (Maqalat al-IHadiqa 191-192). For an example that Ibn Ezra classifies as ighal, Fenton points to Isa 1:18, "Be your sins like crimson, they can turn snow white; be they red as dyed wool, they can become like fleece" (Maqilat al-IHadiqa 195). An example of mubalagha is Nah 3:16, "You had more traders than the sky has stars" (Maqdlat al-IHadiqa 210). 94A.yab-a?-?i'r akdhabuhu = Heb. lmD 1W)vl 3u)n. On this motto, see Cohen, "Poetic Definition," pp. 15-17; Brann, Compunctious Poet, pp. 72-76. On the controversy over hyperbole in Arabic poetics, see Mashiah, pp. 161-168; EI, s.v. "Mubalagha." 95 Ibn Ezra thus implies that the biblical prophets were also poets; on this analogy, see R. Scheindlin, "Rabbi Moshe Ibn Ezra on the Legitimacy of Poetry," Medievalia et Humanistica 7 (1976) 101-115.</page><page sequence="24">556 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW poetic addition at the end of a line that serves to intensify an idea (Kitab al- Muhd-dara 131 a).96 He comments, for example, on Mal 3:17, "I will spare them, as one who spares his son who serves him": In saying "his son" the intended idea is complete, whereas [the phrase] "who serves him" is a marvelous addition and beautiful intensification (tabligh [= mubdiagha] 0asan). (Kitab al-Muhadara 131 a) Here muballagha does not mean hyperbole; it is better rendered emphasis, strengthening or heightening, as noted in recent studies of Arabic poetics.97 A similar observation holds for ighal, which Fenton renders 1 'hyperbole fi- nale (based on the definition of the literary critic Ibn Rashiq in Kitcib al- 'Umda98), though the cases he cites (pp. 334-335) exhibit the more general notion of emphasis through descriptive detail. For example, the concluding ighdl in Ps 1:4, "Not so the wicked, who are like chaff that the wind drives away" (noted in Maqdlat al-Hadiqa 97), intensifies the idea of the tran- sience of the wicked through a graphic portrayal. This broad usage of the terms mubdlagha and ighal by Ibn Ezra suggests that, like his Arab prede- cessors, he saw hyperbole as a specific substrategy within the overall poetic endeavor of composing more descriptive, detailed, and vivid language than plain prose employs. In taking the time in Maqilat al-Hijadiqa to observe the proficiency of biblical authors in using mubalagha and ighal, Ibn Ezra dem- onstrates that Scripture manifests these literary qualities. In conclusion I would like to return to Fenton's work in order to highlight the important scholarly contribution it represents. Philosophie et exegese tells us a great deal about Ibn Ezra's philosophical and philological exege- sis, which are the central themes of Maqalat al-Hadiqa. Fenton masterfully evaluates these aspects of Ibn Ezra's work in light of their Arabic and Jew- ish background. Fenton's survey of the poetic techniques is also a useful reference, though specialists in this field would look for greater precision in defining Ibn Ezra's literary terminology. This reservation notwithstanding, Philosophie et exegese dans le Jardin de la me'taphore de Moise Ibn 'Ezra will certainly become a standard reference for Ibn Ezra's exegesis, something that has been sorely missing until now. Paul Fenton has made this great poet's hermeneutics accessible to the academic world in a pioneering work that will, no doubt, inspire further studies on this multifaceted medieval author, a reward worthy of the finest scholar. 96 See EI, s.v. "Mubalagha"; also Dana, Poetics of Medieval Hebrew, p. 143. 97 See EI, s.v. "Mubalagha." 98 Indeed, Dana, Poetics of Medieval Hebrew, p. 143 notes that Ibn Ezra's use of the term mubalagha in Kitab al-Muha.dara corresponds to ighal in Ibn Rashiq's system.</page></plain_text>
