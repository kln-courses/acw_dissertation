In an age known for exoticism in poetry, no one emerges as more of an exotic than Robert Frost. Without sharing in the climate of experimentalism and the modernist appropriation of language of Pound, Eliot, Stevens, Williams, Cummings and Marianne Moore, Frost has worked within conventions and designs which, no less than theirs, reflect a sense of extremity and disillusion. His being no party to fashion accentuates the qualities today. In what sense is Frost an exotic? How does his poetry reflect a sense of extremity? How is he, of all people, an inappropriate man in an unpropitious place (Stevens' phrase)? No less than the South ern agrarians, no less than the group of American writers in Paris (Frost had his London), no less than the stay-at-home-in-the-city poets whose poetry transcends and enhances the quotidian, Frost had to embrace a myth, in his case, as in the case of others, a myth which was in many ways already there. His real "expatriation" was Vermont, his museum the New England landscape shorn of its Ro 193</page><page sequence="2">mantic vestments. Frost is a poet of New England manqu?. Not so much the farmer he appears to be, his pastoral stance is as much of an imaginative necessity as is tradition to Pound and Eliot. His con versational simplicity in poetry was new and strange. What could be more bracing than the voice(s) of "the prize autocthonous American" (Pound's phrase)? Frost's chosen task is, among other things, the redefinition of normal life in the face of the threatening larger society. Like the liberal intellectuals whom he encountered with indifference, Frost was often going against the American grain. It was characteristic of him to make his discontinuity with metro politan literary culture serve as culture itself. Frost stood alone. The generally accepted importance of the figures Frost liked to pooh pooh?Freud, Dostoevski, Marx, the New York alec, the modernists themselves?would indicate that time will emphasize all the more the extremity of the farmer mask, the exoticism of the plain manner. There seems little doubt that America is headed in the direction of greater rather than less intellectual sophistication. It is likely that the pastoral vein will always be a rich one for American writers because of rather than despite these tendencies. Frost the profound nature poet and self-ironic Yankee (though not the arch, anti intellectual sage) will always be a major poet. In resisting the dominant tendencies of the age, in making guarded affirmations, he was most part of it. One of the virtues of Reuben Brower's book on Frost is that it helps to define Frost as a characteristic twentieth-century figure. There is a sustained section (chapters four through eight) of his study which in analyzing the poetry delineates Frost's mind, his re lationship to Wordsworth, Emerson, Thoreau, William James, in short, his refashioning of Romanticism, his skepticism, his pragmatic temper, in a way more concentrated, various and discriminating than anything yet written on Frost. Frost, it is clear, stands with Yeats, Pound and Eliot as a renewer of the speaking voice in poetry, as one who agrees that poetry should be as well-written as prose. Furthermore, "The surprise of Ms poetry ... is that Frost found in country knowledge the intellectual sophistication, 'the new terms of worth,' he was looking for, which we now recognize as 'twentieth-century' or 'modern.'" The sophisticated wit, the play of consciousness, the mind in search of its own meaning, the dis crimination of a usable past are there. To take a commonplace ex ample, in "Mowing," "Frost's poetic feat lies in saving the Emer sonian value without a wisp of Emerson's transcendental faith." And 194</page><page sequence="3">in "West-Running Brook," Frost's "stream is one, not the 'two rivers' of Emerson's poem?which again indicates how close Frost is to Emerson, and also where they part company." Brower reports that Frost, replying to "the accusation of 'being Emersonian, that is a cheerful monist,' said 'A melancholy dualism is the only sound ness. The question is: is soundness of the essence.' The last sentence is 'a fraction of one percent' in favor of cheerfulness?that's about all." "The Most of It," "For Once, Then, Something," "All Revela tion," "To Anxious For Ribers," "Neither Out Far Nor In Deep" all of these are characteristic of the modern temper, "in which the poet stands off and regards himself in the act of seeing reality, cosmic or human, and in which he weighs the possible relationship between the mind and an independent reality." But in reading through the detailed and skilfully ordered explications of the text, one perhaps too often has the feeling that he has been there before. Neither obscure nor unread, Frost is not Pound; a book on him should be more than a primer. There is almost unanimous agreement that Frost is a major poet; there is con siderable agreement that his performance is disturbingly uneven. Brower seems to agree with this but never comes to critical grips with it. His intention, of course is appreciation?but who is appreci ated more than or as much as Frost? A more total assessment would have made a more adventurous book. A more precise delineation of Frost's masks related to the distinction of his poetry or the lack of it where there is a lack, seems to be called for in a general book on Frost at this time. Is the Yankee farmer as distinguished as the nature poet? The satirist as the lyricist? What of that aspect of Frost which emerges as "the Peter Pan of the National Association of Manu facturers?" (Randall Jarrel's phrase?all Frost criticism since his ex cellent essays is indebted to them) What of the general sloughing off in quality of his later books? For all the difficulties it raises, is it worth saying, as Brower does, "Like Dryden and Pope, he comes forward and speaks to his readers as a member of a society and a recognizable public personality"? Is not a more important question: What price has Frost paid?knowingly or not?for his universal popularity? Brower says that despite the fact that "there is no poet of whose voice we are surer, no poet whom we hear more distinctly than Frost" we should not mistake the voice of the poet for the actual man. He goes on to discriminate incompletely among "voices," but never comes to terms with the value or efficacy of the particular voice. To be sure, the "voice" is an "act" rather than a 195</page><page sequence="4">report, but defining the relationship of the "act" to the poet is an important task of the critic of contemporary poetry which is so often a poetry of strategies. The major virtue and major limitation of Brower as a critic is that he approaches literature as the Ideal Reader. He is learned ("learned but articulate" the dust jacket says), sensitive and de voted. He can read Frost side by side with Horace, Cowper, Emer son, or Stevens. For a poem by poem appreciative analysis Brower is Frost's best expositor. It is far too easy to underrate the impor tance of his task, to forget how imprecise, how shoddy, interpre tation can be. He handles questions of meter, rhythm and sound often with great precision. He notes justly that "Frost's main tech nical achievement (is) the invention of a new blank verse rhythm." He compares aptly the ideas of Frost and William James: "Though he shies away from questions that don't concern us, yet like James ... he can admit the possibility of extranatural powers and modes of being, though more characteristically he finds the mysterious and sacred in our experience of 'things'." But one might wish that he did not ride the obvious quite so often, or include in his book end less technical observations that are more suitable to classroom pres entation. At its worst Brower's prose is the product of a sensibility machine, the aim of which is to capture every nuance, existent or non-existent. A poem rings "with a perhaps unconscious echo of Virgil's out videt out videsse putat." "The Oven Bird," "melts im perceptibly into iambics"; the "meter flutters slightly" on "every one." We hear of "the curving thrust of the rhythm," "the poising of tones." In one or two places Brower is so carried away by the sounds of words that the analysis itself gives us an unintentional echo of those sounds. He speaks of "the nasal scorn (nearly a snort) in 'They cannot scare me .. .' " ("Desert Places") and "the taunting threat, like "Lei them think twice' in 'Spring Pools'." And, occa sionally, he pursues what seems to be a strained formal comparison between poems. All of which is to say that Brower is so sensitive as to discern effects which may not be there or which may be accidental, in the nature of putting words together into a meter-making argument. One is almost tempted to wonder what Brower would do with, say, the lead story of the New York Times if it were set to iambics. The uneasy moments in Brower's book occur when one is unde cided as to whether Brower is really the world's champion poetry reader or someone wringing blood from a stone. In these moments Brower's prose is a poetry of its own, heavily metaphorical and 196</page><page sequence="5">ringing with a delicate anthropomorphism. This complication aside, Brower tells us much about a line by line reading of Frost. Critics will, or should, say that this is a first-rate job of close reading. Some may also say, or should, that Brower is too close a reader of Frost in that he nowhere stands off and coolly regards his subject. Though in isolating the most distinguished expressions of most of Frost's real themes Brower engages in implicit evaluation, more conclusive evaluative generalizations are not forthcoming. Brower can give us a splendid analysis of "West-Running Brook," prefacing it with the blandly adulatory remark that, "Frost often takes the considerable risk of writing about the relation least easy to treat in poetry without sentimentality or irony"?that of married lovers. But the way Frost treats it is it a risk at all? Frost's descrip tions of lovers are innocent of passion, of conversion through love, of the exciting apprehension of the painfully, blissfully necessary other. In this sense, Frost's poems about lovers, married or otherwise, are not personal. The epithalamium for his daughter and son in-law, "The Master Speed," is magnificent bravura. Indeed, if there is one element above all missing from Frost it is the element of personal risk in relating to another. Irving Howe in a fine recent piece on Frost laments the inclusion of the last stanza of "Desert Places." Frost does give us "my own desert places" insofar as one is able to in his encounter with nature and with morbid or moribund New England types. But "my own desert places" understood as the dramatization of his own wild darkness is something that Frost does not offer as a poet (which is a reason for his power as well as his limitation). In the beautiful "Acquainted With the Night" I have always wondered just what Frost is unwilling to explain. He never does explain it. Brower does not entertain this kind of consideration. Those seeking an analysis of Frost that penetrates beyond the poem as a fait accompli, those seeking an insight into Frost's struggling with his themes, those seeking a weighing of his strengths and weak nesses as he relates to his culture, those seeking a psychological analysis of language will have to look elsewhere. Still, for the serious student and general reader this remains the best general treatment of Frost to date. For those who wish to learn how to read a poem this book is as good as any. Radcliffe Squire's Frost is different from Brower's. Where Brower sees Frost as a unique voice but in his themes and diction very much a twentieth-century figure, Squires emphasizes Frost's difference from his contemporaries to the exclusion of similarities. The result 197</page><page sequence="6">is that there are a good many snatches of misplaced polemic in Squire's study, many of them unhappily placed at the beginning. Pound, Stevens, Auden, Trilling are more or less dismissed in one elongated breath. What is most irritating about this is not the dismissal (Who will swallow it whole, or even in part? For example, though their poetry is in many ways at odds, a responsible comparison of Frost and Stevens would show surprising thematic similarities.) but the fact that it has little to do with Squire's argument. Although Frost's sanity comes from a close contact with nature?"You put in the seed, you cultivate, you reap all in the sane relationship with life as it was once more happily conceived. You stand in the good of the senses and the seasons. You see man in the perspective not of history but of nature which has, surely, a half-life of infinity"?not having a sense of history may not be a great advantage. Robert Langbaum has argued that the nature poetry of Stevens, Marianne Moore, Eberhart, Wilbur and Merwin gains much from being more than simply an encounter between man and nature. Langbaum sees Frost as a bit old-fashioned and pre fers "the new nature poetry" with its awareness not only of Darwin but, as it may be, of Frazer and Freud. Squires, on the other hand, maintains that Frost's insularity is a blessing. Need he through, to exalt the old naturalistic encounter, say: "the typical modern poet has drawn his subjects not from the city of God but from the city of man, from something that is continuously failing . . . today one sees mainly that affluence and justice and freedom do not make men good or wise or happy." This statement may open up vast possibilities in the critical sub-genre known as the Colossal Aside. One of the attractions of Frost to Squires is the illusion of living in a timeless universe. Squires says, for instance, "he sees others everywhere tack ing with the careless wind following the brief intellectual fashion with intense seriousness." If this sounds like a philistine preacher on Frost, a moral deserving richer support is drawn for us: "God, the beginning and end, the absolute principle and unity, stands in the center." It may be that God stands in the center. But Squires does not make clear how Frost conceives of God as "the absolute prin ciple and unity." The statement disintegrates when Squires tact lessly uses it as a whip to flog Frost's contemporaries: "other poets of stature have made their singular choice of the perishing republic or the ideas of order or the cultivation of Christmas trees." The tone 198</page><page sequence="7">here is not only unfair to at least Eliot and Stevens, it is self defeating. Squire's Frost is too much the disappointed transcendentalist: "The truth is that Frost would like nature to concur with human intuition more than it is ever willing to do . . . Frost's dilemma is that of an American transcendentalism which would, if it could, find in nature (of all places!) the equivalences, indeed identities, of civilized hopes." Is it not a commonplace of Frost criticism that the dilemmas of the transcendentalists are the disillusioned assump tions of the skeptical Yankee? Where Brower documents Frost's es sential "melancholy dualism," Squires makes the case for what he calls, in what seems a gesture of wish-fulfillment, his sensuous per ception of a "rationalistic monism, in a word 'absolutism'." Both, rightly, consider "West-Running Brook" one of his best poems. Squires emphasizes its "monism" its "worship of the God which science imposes upon man," its movement from "irreligion" to a "guarded faith" without ever discarding its "bleak pluralism" or "skepticism." Brower's emphasis is on a denial of any orthodox First Cause, on the transcendent in things, on the Jamesian flux and the power of human consciousness?"the act of will and mind in a loving study and penetration of the flux . . . sees form there and, in the act of recognizing it, finds a stay against confusion." Brower seems closer to the poem's emphasis. Squires' odd interpretive emphasis is seen in the famous "After Apple Picking." Equating Frost with a persona who seems fairly remote from him, Squire feels that "Frost, though he comes to the threshold of a final vision, willfully draws back. When he counts the things of this world, the counting becomes a dismal repetition before which the human mind reels and he finds himself in the sameness of the wood. The things, the data, the reality of nature, then, while conceived as precious and never to be abandoned, do not deliver truth to him but illusion, the sameness of the wood, the mocking, revenent apples." It is pressing to equate Frost with the old man who is one of his many characterizations of quietly despereate New England types on the decline. Furthermore, Frost is not concerned with anything as portentous as a "final vision." The poem is about the momentum of the actual carrying over into "heaven." The "essence of winter sleep" is an allusion to a final reality but one which is inseparable from the fragrance of this life. Similarly, it seems a point of misplaced emphasis to consider the swinging of birches toward heaven, in "Birches," as "yearning 199</page><page sequence="8">for paradise." The swinging upward of the birches is as far toward heaven as Frost will go. His feet are soon happily on the ground again. Frost's "religion," his "heaven," is not a matter of absolutism but of natural piety, as with much of Wordsworth. See "Directive," a "best poem" of Frost's which Squires does not mention. Nor does he mention other "best poems" like "Acquainted With the Night," "On a Bird Singing in Its Sleep," and "The Most of It," from which a composite picture emerges of his break with the absolute, his willingness to stand alone, his exquisite awareness of what can be a bleakly indifferent universe. In short, Squires' evaluative generaliza tion that "all of his most important poems move one way or another from a plexus where a discontent with the book of nature tempts him toward a celestial journey" is unconvincing. All of which is to say less of Squires' book than it deserves. For when he settles down to the business of analyzing poetry his criticism is often distinguished, as when he says that Frost's poetry of observation "while depending on the senses cannot be described as sensuous." Squires, who has published a volume of poems, confines his technical remarks to spare, incisive inclusion. He is always deal ing with the poetry of Robert Frost rather than how to read a poem. He has a fine eye for the best lines, the striking image, the worst lines, the weak image. He is very good at trenchant summary statement: "Form to him ... is separable from content, a source of amusement in itself . . . For this reason one may in some of Frost's poems feel a disappointment that though there is a shift of meaning or attitude the poem jogs on as if it had not heard what it was say ing. But also for this reason one may quite as often feel that in no other modern poet does the whole poem finally remain so whole, turning with all the spare, wicked grace of true epigram." Like Brower, Squires gives us Frost's themes through a poem by poem analysis, with frequent asides to relevant poems and ideas of others. While the reader will often find Squires' analysis rewarding and his tone, so free from adulation, refreshing, the fuller, better treatment both in point of poetic detail, ideas and overall design is in Brower's study. What emerges from this criticism is a real advance in the poem by poem reading of Frost and an enhanced sense of just which are the great poems. There a substantial number of them. 200</page></plain_text>
