Originally designed as the style guide for writers and editors at Microsoft Corporation, The Microsoft Manual provides guidelines for developing a wide range of documentation, from manuals to multimedia products. In addition to its comprehensive scope, accessible format, and straightforward style (complex concepts are illustrated with examples and /or supported by graphics), the manual offers two unique features that set it apart from its competitors: coverage of new terms and technologies for Microsoft Windows 95 and a 3.5-inch disk that includes the entire manual as a Windows 95 Help file. Designed as "an authoritative source of guidance for software documentation" that focuses on "advice that's clear, up-to-date, and easy to find," The Microsoft Manual has four stated goals: • To provide a standard other companies can follow or adapt as well as examples for professionals such as writers, editors, and educators working in the computer industry. • To provide direction for independent software vendors that create products compatible with Microsoft software. • To set standards for clarity and consistency that will help ensure that the product information users receive is as effective and easy to use as possible. • To serve as a catalyst for consistency in other areas, such as product and interface design, (p. v) Not surprisingly - given that it was "written and reviewed by a group of experienced Microsoft documentation specialists" - it meets each one. The Microsoft Manual consists of two main parts: a 257- page "A-Z Style Reference" (entries range from "abbreviations and acronyms" to "zoom in, zoom out") and three appendixes that address topics that can confound even the most dedicated documentation "experts": "Acronyms," "Special Characters," and "Words with Numbers." It includes a comprehensive 17-page index, the usefulness of which is augmented by the Help version of the manual. The book presents information in several categories, including the correct and consistent use of terminology and the treatment of conventions, procedures, and design elements, such as headers, footers, and figure captions. It addresses standard style issues (such as the use of commas 178 Technical Communication, Second Quarter 1997 When Your System Requires Horsepower ... not RAM Your company doesn't produce software or hi-tech medical products.

For example, the authors advise document developers to "avoid giving hardware or software human characteristics." To illustrate, they provide "guidelines for evaluating anthropomorphism" that list phrases deemed acceptable ("The design assistant guides you through the process of publishing a newsletter.") and questionable ("The design assistant will take you by the hand and lead you through the process of publishing a newsletter"). And after defining jargon as "technical language [that] . . . serves as a shortcut to understanding concepts for those who understand the term," the authors describe three general instances in which computer jargon is not acceptable: if a more familiar term could easily be used (symbol or icon instead of glyph ; electronic file instead of soft copy); if it obscures rather than clarifies meaning ( struct for structure ; disambiguate for clarify); or if it is not specific to areas such as computer software, networks, or operating systems (this means avoiding journalistic and marketing jargon such as "leverage"). Demonstrating an acute awareness of their global audience, the authors also address topics such as bias-free communication and international considerations. In reference to bias, they caution writers to avoid racial, cultural, sexual, and other stereotypes, such as "equating people with their disabilities." Within this context, they advise using "terms that refer to physical differences as nouns rather than adjectives." To illustrate, they give examples of phrases deemed correct ("Customers who are blind can use these features") and incorrect ("The blind can use these features"). They also recommend avoiding "terms that engender discomfort, pity, or guilt, such as suffers from , stricken with , or afflicted by "; encourage including "people with disabilities in art and illustrations, showing them integrated in an unremarkable way with other members of society"; and recommend avoiding any mention of a disability "unless it is pertinent." To illustrate, they cite the subtle but powerful difference between phrases deemed correct ("Play-goers who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can attend signed performances") and incorrect ("Theaters now offer signed performances for the deaf"). In reference to the international considerations, the authors address several critical issues related to writing for translation, such as using correct and consistent wording, avoiding ambiguity, and avoiding idiomatic or colloquial expressions. A section titled "Samples, scenarios, and art" addresses the issue of cultural diversity, pointing out that "Unless samples, scenarios, and art are planned with cultural diversity in mind, artwork must be created from scratch for localized product versions. Because samples and visual material are never re-created for the English product versions sold outside the U.S., this material should be universally appealing as well as culturally appropriate." To illustrate, they point to the problems posed by some symbols and images, such as "product wizards" and U.S.- style mailboxes, and by "inappropriate scenarios" involving luxury consumer goods such as gourmet dog food or varieties of birdbaths. The authors also address the issue of text expansion, an important factor that must be considered when planning the content, structure, and size of a document that will be translated. To illustrate, they provide sample English-to- German translations demonstrating that a single English phrase of 50 characters expands to 92 characters (an increase of 84%) when translated into German. Like any style guide, The Microsoft Manual provides answers to a wide range of questions concerning format, usage, and style, but - as illustrated in the preceding paragraphs - its scope goes well beyond the rather limited range of "standard" style guides. Therefore, it is not recommended for beginning technical writers primarily interested in "the basics" of technical communication. For although the authors do an excellent job in defining the concepts they present, they tend to assume that users are already familiar with standard computer concepts and terminology, an assumption that is not unwarranted, since Microsoft employees (the original target audience for the manual) are undoubtedly expected to possess such knowledge. One indication is the index which, although comprehensive, provides few cross-references. Therefore, users who are not already familiar with such acronyms and abbreviations as ASCII, QBE , and FTP are given little Technical Communication, Second Quarter 1997 1 79 THE lOcj^Y GROUP Internationally recognized experts in the design and development of online documentation. / GOING ONLINE^ / CD-ROM SERIES ' / f Fran^!Îaker*ïb; ' t i Acrobat, FrameViewer, | I l HtML,Winñelp I 'fc' Lotus Notes / Domino / y THE ROCKLEY REPORT Quarterly report on tips, tools, techniques and guidelines for effective documentation.

Locating QBE in the index leads the user to Appendix A, which gives the "meaning" as "query by example. " However, neither QBE nor query by example is listed or defined in the "Style Reference" section. Another indication is the emphasis on Windows 95 terminology, which - for those who have not yet made the giant leap from Microsoft Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 - is "nice to know" but not essential. In some places, information seems to be missing or incomplete. For example, although the index lists "nouns, " "verbs," "adjectives," and "prepositions" as separate entries, it does not so list "pronouns," "adverbs," and "conjunctions." The Microsoft Manual of Style is an excellent reference guide for the professional technical communicator. Packed with concise, comprehensive information, it indeed provides "a solid foundation for writing and editing that accommodates innovation and change." It may even prompt some DOS diehards to "do Windows." Durthy A. Washington Owner, Style Guides by Design Colorado Springs, CO</page></plain_text>
