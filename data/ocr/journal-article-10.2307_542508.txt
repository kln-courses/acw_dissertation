<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Wohnhduser in Assur. By CONRAD PREUS- SER. Die Graber und Griifte von Assur. By ARNDT HALLER. ("64. und 65. Wissen- schaftliche Ver6ffentlichung der deutschen Orientgesellschaft. Ausgrabungen der deut- schen Orientgesellschaft in Assur: A. Die BaudenkmAler der Assyrischen Zeit, VI und VII.") Berlin: Gebr. Mann, 1954. These handsome volumes contain the sys- tematic presentation of material excavated at Assur by Walter Andrae and his staff from 1903 to 1914. The first book is devoted to the residential buildings of Assur, which range from the palatial habitations of the wealthy to the simple dwellings of the poor. Little but the foundations of the houses was preserved, but these were recorded with such painstaking care and are presented to the reader with such ex- cellent plans and descriptions that it is pos- sible to walk in spirit through every house and see how each owner proceeded with his indi- vidual interpretation of the general features of Assyrian domestic architecture. Most of the excavated houses belonged to the neo-Assyrian period. Plans of earlier build- ings, however, include a house ascribed to the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur (p. 6, al- though the title of the relevant discussion reads: "Das Wohnhaus aus altakkadischer Zeit"), an Old Assyrian house, and two build- ing complexes of the Middle Assyrian period. The Old Assyrian house is compared to earlier southern examples for evidence of a stairway which led up to the roof. The same feature is also found in one of the Middle Assyrian houses. Later buildings had only modest and probably less comfortable means of access to the roof. This difference between neo-Assyrian building practices and those of the earlier peri- od is characteristic throughout, even the quali- ty of the building materials deteriorated in the later period, the clay for the bricks was mixed with large amounts of rubble as was the mor- tar, which was probably taken from the imme- diate vicinity of the house. Some of this may have been due to the fact that in the large neo- Assyrian city of Assur, clean clay had to be sought much farther afield than in the smaller Middle Assyrian town. Likewise the existence of older houses caused the irregularity of many</page><page sequence="2">68 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES of the neo-Assyrian ground plans, which had to be fitted into the existing space. Despite the resulting variation in ground plans every builder obviously made an attempt to create within the house a vestibule and an interior court. In wealthier houses a clear division existed between the front and the main part of the house. In the latter the principal court fre- quently had a liwan-like extension. In the largest houses small ancillary courts gave ac- cess to the side rooms and also provided them with light since windows in our sense did not exist. Light came into a room through the door and perhaps through small openings near the ceiling. It is interesting to note that neither toilets nor kitchens could be identified with certainty in the ruins of these neo-Assyrian houses, al- though a small room in house No. 20 (p. 32) was tentatively interpreted as a kitchen. Traces of an installation for heating a room were discovered in the partially excavated house No. 55 a (p. 49). In the center of the main room of the house were stone rails which must have run the entire length of the room and on which could have been manipulated a hearth on wheels such as the one found at Tell Halaf. Similar rails had been previously found in palaces of the period (cf. H. Frankfort in JNES, XI [1952], 226) but this seems to be the first occurrence in a private house. Accord- ing to Preusser the normal procedure was to use certain rooms of the dwelling for the burial of members of the family. Occasionally the en- tire house was left over to the dead and the entrance was walled up. Probably insufficient precautions in burying the corpse had made it seem advisable to leave the old house and build a new one. From the excavation of the neo-Assyrian houses on the terrace built earlier by the Middle Assyrian king Tukulti Ninurta I, the excavators were able to deduce not only de- tails concerning the appearance of the single houses but also to reconstruct some of the liv- ing patterns of the inhabitants of this section, which seems to have been dominated by the house of a nobleman around which clustered the dwellings of his retainers. Much of the information contained in the present volume and the interpretation given to it by the excavators was summarized in An- drae's popular book, Das wiedererstehende Assur (1938), for which the Wohnhduser now provides a sound basis. Relatively few small finds were published in the present book because the graves and their often rich contents were separately published (see below) as were the pottery (cf. W. Andrae, Farbige Keramik aus Assur [1923]), the cylin- der seals (included in A. Moortgat, Vordera- siatische Rollsiegel [Berlin, 1940]), and other small finds such as the fragments of the Tridacna shell found in house No. 58 (p. 50) and discussed by W. Andrae in a separate ar- ticle (ZA, NF XI [1939], 88-98). Those which are included, however, are of considerable interest. The largest is a relief of Mosul alabaster showing a god on a bull drag- on (P1. 15a). Preusser's suggestion that the protuberances over the shoulders and below the waist of the god are rays and characterize the deity as a sun-god cannot be accepted. As scholars like Conteneau never questioned (Manuel d'archdologie orientale, I [1931] p. 1279), the protuberances are the ends of the quiver-and-bow case of a type which is docu- mented in Assyria from the time of Shalma- neser III onward (cf. H. Bonnet, Die Waffen der Vilker des alten Orients [1926], p. 179). Since most major deities including Ishtar fre- quently wear such cases on neo-Assyrian cylin- der seals, the identification of the god on the relief cannot be based on this detail and must remain an open problem if Preusser is right in rejecting the earlier interpretation of the god as Assur, made on the basis of his symbol, the winged sun-disk which appears in the sky. Preusser considered the celestial symbols as referring to deities other than the one repre- sented in anthropomorphic form on the relief. Of considerable interest, furthermore, is the place in which the relief was found, namely one of the two "bathrooms" of the house. Preusser himself seemed to have some doubts about the presence of two relatively richly furnished bathrooms in what he described as a none too opulent house. In the reviewer's opinion the popular American attitude which prevailed in the first three decades of the cen-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 69 tury, that the quality of the plumbing is a criterion of civilization, influenced even ar- cheologists in regarding as mere "bath- rooms" what may have been places for ritual ablutions and other ceremonies. Thus the re- lief might not have been hidden in the "bath- room," as suggested by Preusser, but could have belonged in that chamber in the first place. Another object of considerable interest is the lead plaquette with a female head, full face, surrounded by astral rosettes and inter- preted as an image of Ishtar (P1. 15 b). Repre- sentations such as this may have been the pro- totype for the representations of female busts- on rings of the Persian age, of which impres- sions were found at Ur (cf. L. Legrain, Ur Exc. Vol. X, Seal Cylinders [1951], P1. 39, Nos. 709 and 710). The standard finial (P1. 19) provides an important Assyrian example of a type of object of which so far only two specimens ascribed to Lurestan workmanship have become known (E. Borowsky, "A Bronze Standard from Persia," Archaeology, V, No. 1 [Spring 1952], pp. 22-24). Finally, protective clay figurines were dis- covered under the floor of the principal room of the front section and again in the main room of the inner section of house No. 20 (p. 32) as well as under the floor of the main room and its entrances in the "house of the conjura- tion priest" (Pls. 15d and 29, a-c). These will receive more extensive treatment in the future (p. 58), but mention may be made here of the close relation between these figurines and those discovered at other Assyrian and Baby- lonian sites, especially Nimrud, discussed by Mallowan (Iraq, XVI [1954], pp. 85-93). The second volume, Haller's Grdiber und Gritfte von Assur, presents a concise, well or- ganized, and informative account of the burials found at Assur. These were not concentrated in a cemetery but distributed over the entire town with preference for residential precincts. Of the 1140 graves only the most typical and richly furnished were given full description while the others were listed in a catalogue. The division of the graves was made on a typologi- cal basis, namely pit graves(" Erdgriber"), sherd graves ("ScherbengrSber"), brick graves ("ZiegelgrAber") and burials in clay vessels subdivided into jar or bottle graves ("Topf oder Flaschengriber"), double jar or capsule graves ("Doppeltopf oder Kapselgriber), pot- lid graves ("Stiilpgraber"), urn and terracotta coffin graves. The last mentioned were again sub-divided into contracted coffins, trough cof- fins, double tub coffins, single tub coffins, and composite graves. Within each type the graves were divided chronologically on the basis of stratification and tomb furnishings. Of the latter the pottery was of course the most char- acteristic, permitting a clear distinction be- tween the graves of the pre-Assyrian and those of the Old Assyrian period (ca. 1900-1500 B.C.) of the Middle Assyrian period (1500-1100 B.C.), earlier neo-Assyrian period (1100-824 B.C.), later neo-Assyrian period (824-612 B.C.), and post-Assyrian period. After the discussion of the graves follows that of the private and royal tombs. Among the private tombs there was one rock-cut, one stone-walled and four mud-brick tombs, all others had their subterranean chamber built of baked brick. No true vaulting could be ob- served among the Old Assyrian tombs, all of which had corbelled roofs. In the Middle As- syrian period appeared barrel-vaulted tombs in which the vault was produced by radial layers of bricks placed lengthwise along the axis of the tomb. A further development seems to have occurred when the bricks, usually of trapezoid form, were placed in radial layers with their length at right angles to the axis of the tomb, thereby obviating additional sup- port while the roof was being constructed. The earliest tomb with this type of vaulting was assigned with some reservations to the Middle Assyrian period. Mention was made by the excavators, however, of the fact that the type occurred earlier in Babylon. Many of the graves and tombs were robbed of their contents, tomb No. 56 even appears to have been rifled shortly after its construc- tion but was soon re-used, all within the Middle Assyrian period. The royal tombs, which were located under the floor of the "Old Palace" and were with one exception joined to each other by a system of corridors, were not</page><page sequence="4">70 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES only denuded of their furnishings but were ruthlessly destroyed. The sarcophagi were smashed, the basalt pavement torn out, the basalt socles rifled. Other tombs, however, retained their funerary offerings intact, especially No. 45, singled out for lengthy treatment by Andrae in a special section inserted in Haller's text (pp. 123-48). Basing his conclusions on Haller's detailed report, B. Hrouda summarized in an appendix (pp. 183-88) the characteristic elements of Assyrian funerary practices. He considered the forms of Assyrian graves to have become dis- tinctive only from the Middle Assyrian period onward and then largely by their careful con- struction and clearcut shapes of sarcophagi and other receptacles for the bodies. From the fact that the dead were generally buried within their former dwellings he de- duced that the deceased was still considered as belonging to the family and had a right to the ownership of his former possessions such as jewelry and weapons, which were never replaced by models. Referring to an interesting suggestion by Wiesner, Hrouda assumed that the legal personality of the deceased was close- ly connected with the appearance of the corpse. When the corpse had disintegrated the legal personality was extinguished. In Hrou- da's opinion, however, the memory of the de- ceased was kept alive much longer by his de- scendants as shown by funerary offerings made at a later date. He does not give precise refer- ences for such practices, however, and one may wonder whether indeed such a belief in the lengthy survival of the spirit of the common man existed. A. L. Oppenheim's conclusions, for example, which were based on the extant literary material, do not support such a sup- position (cf. "Assyro-Babylonian Religion," in Ancient Religions, ed. V. Ferm [1950], p. 77). For the period immediately following his decease, however, the dead was amply supplied with food, cosmetics, and ointments, and most important of all, with water. In contrast to Egyptian practice, the relative paucity of funerary amulets and conjuration texts is sur- prising. Only the sets of three ungulates, goats or gazelles, found in burials of the Old Assyrian period constitute a distinctive funerary offer- ing, interpreted by Hrouda as scapegoats to attract to themselves the evil menacing the deceased. In several instances Haller's dating of graves seems to have been influenced by the classification of the seals found within it. The first example is the pit grave No. 2, which con- tained two cylinder seals published by Moort- gat in Vorderasiatische Rollsiegel (Berlin, 1940), Nos. 203 and 248. In this work, Moort- gat did not differentiate between the cylinders belonging to the mature style of the Akkad period and those of the post-Akkad style to which the reviewer would ascribe both pieces. (For the definition of that style cf. Corpus of Ancient Near Eastern Seals, I [1948], pp. 31-32 and AJA, LVIII [1954], p. 339). Moortgat clearly pointed out (op. cit., p. 26) that the cylinder No. 248 was found in a grave more recent than the Akkad period. This then must have been the excavators' original opinion, while Haller's dating seems to have been influ- enced by Moortgat's publication. The second grave of which the classification seems to have been made dependent on the dating of a cylinder seal is No. 19, which was still included among the pit graves of the Third Dynasty of Ur with a reference (p. 10, n. 25) to Moortgat's dating of the "Cappadocian- type" cylinder seal in the end of the Third Dy- nasty of Ur. In the section of Vorderasiatische Rollsiegel to which the reader is referred, how- ever, Moortgat does not endorse such a dating; on the contrary, he clearly states that the cyl- inder seal inscribed with the name of Ibi-Sin, the last ruler of the Third Dynasty of Ur, must have been re-used in the time of the Cappado- cian colonists, and he does not suggest any overlapping of the period of the Assyrian colo- nists with the last years of the Third Dynasty of Ur. In this Moortgat is in conformity with the most recent studies on the chronology of the Old Assyrian merchant colonies in eastern Asia Minor (Kemal Balkan, "Observations on the Chronological Problems of the Karum Kanik," Belleten [1955], pp. 41-100). Grave No. 19, which contains a characteristic ex- ample of Old Assyrian or "Cappadocian" glyp-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 71 tic style, should therefore be included among the interments of the Old Assyrian period. Again, grave No. 811 is assigned to the Achaemenian period on the basis of the finds, which include seals described as Achaemenid in the text but belonging in the reviewer's opinion to late Assyrian style. The first (p. 71, Fig. 88, top, left) is a scaraboid showing a deity on a lion. Though reproduced by outline draw- ing only, the piece seems to resemble closely, in the posture and the weapons of the deity, a seal from Khorsabad ("OIP," XL, P1. 58: 112) which was found in room No. 28 of the Nabu temple and which surely belonged to the period of Sargon. The second scaraboid (ibid., center) belonging to a less well-determined group, nevertheless shows none of the charac- teristics of Achaemenid style and may well be late neo-Assyrian. Last, the drawing of the scaraboid with a nude winged figure kneeling with feet stretched out on either side (ibid., right) is probably a misunderstood rendering of a standing figure with toes turned out, as represented on the base of the typically neo- Assyrian bull pendant of tomb No. 64 (P1. 38 b). This evidence indicates that grave No. 811 belongs to the late neo-Assyrian rather than to the Achaemenian period. On two other points involving glyptic ob- jects, the reviewer's opinion differs from that of the authors. The first point concerns the frit beads and scarabs (or scaraboids?) found in the neo-Assyrian grave No. 45 and described as of Egyptian origin. Since they include such typically Assyrian or Babylonian symbols as the tasseled crescent staff (P1. 11 b, second row from left, second from top, and fifth row from left, second from top) they could hardly have been made in Egypt. Rather, these Egyp- tianizing amulets, which are found all over the Near East in and after the seventh century B.C., indicate a belief in the efficacy of Egyp- tian magic, the renown of which probably ppread through Esharhaddon's and Ashurna- sirpal's campaigns and later through the Greek colonists. The second point concerning glyptic objects to which the reviewer takes exception is the fact that Andrae only cites two examples of cylinder seals owned by women (p. 129, n. 175). Actually, the number of such seals is considerably larger though of course incom- parably smaller than that of the seals belong- ing to men. For example, in the collection of the Morgan Library (cf. Corpus, I), which in- cludes 202 inscribed cylinder seals, three be- longed to women. It is regrettable that not all the objects found in the graves could have been illustrat- ed. The copper lyres of the Old Assyrian period (mentioned on p. 97), for example, would have been most interesting to see for their possible relation to Egyptian lyres and to lyres repre- sented on the seal impressions and cylinders of the Old Assyrian tablets from Kiiltepe (e.g., N. Ozgiic, Ausgrabungen in Kidltepe 1949 {Ankara, 1953], P1. LXII, 702; Berytus, VII [1942], P1. VIII: 1 (Walters Art Gallery C 57). Those objects, however, and principally the structures which have been illustrated and dis- cussed in these volumes, add greatly to our knowledge of the material culture posssessed by the Assyrians and of the provisions which they made for their dead.
