Eight years later Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627-1678) published his lengthier Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst (Introduction to the academy of painting). Given the subject of these works, it is not surprising that both authors are mainly studied by art historians; however, in light of the present volume, the question may be asked if this does justice to the full range of their endeavours. Their interests were certainly not limited to the visual arts. After publishing several titles on art, Goeree directed his attention to other fields of knowledge, such as theology and world history.1 Van Hoogstraten wrote, next to his treatise on painting, subtitled De zichtbaere werelt (The visible world), a counterpart titled De onzichtbare werelt (The invisible world). The exact content remains unknown, since the book was never published, but experts suspect it dealt with philosophical matters.2 Like most men and women of some education, Goeree and Van Hoogstraten had interests that widely surpassed present- day disciplinary boundaries. A more comprehensive approach to their work seems therefore desirable, if not obligatory. The interest art historians have paid to the two authors has been somewhat unequal. Recently Van Hoogstraten was rewarded with four extensive monographs, while Goeree is barely studied as a subject in his own right.3 The only extensive work written on the versatile man is the annotated text edition by Michael Kwakkelstein of his earlier publication, Inleydinge tot de al-ghemeene teycken-konst. Apart from that, there have been articles about Goerees writings on architecture and world history, and he is mentioned in studies on draughtsmanship and art education.4 A reason for this limited attention might be that his work is considered to be not very original. Also, Goeree was not an artist himself, which might make him less appealing to art historians. Furthermore, the fact that his writings on art are somewhat scattered probably hinders systematic research. Goeree did not write a coherent magnum opus , like Van Hoogstraten did, but published five separate works between 1668 and 1682.5 Apart from the Inleyding (...) schilder-konst , he published works on drawing, watercolour, architecture and the human body. Nevertheless, Detail fig. i Artist unknown, The human head in different positions</page><page sequence="3">1 86 Gijsbert M. van de Roemer Goerees earlier ambitions regarding the arts were as inclusive as those of Van Hoogstraten. He considered his writings as part of a grander work, which he first envisioned in 1670. This plan was never executed, but the publications were reissued in different collections in 1697, 17°4 an(i I7°5- The Inleyding (...) schilder-konst can be considered the general introduction to the greater work he hoped to write, and the other publications as substantial parts of the whole.6 As they are of a similar time frame, and since Dutch writings on art from the seventeenth century are comparatively rare, the two writers - when discussed together by art historians - are often treated as if they were of one accord. Hans-Jörg Czech assumes that Van Hoogstratens elaborate chapter division inspired Goeree to do likewise.7 Lyckle de Vries discusses the writings of Goeree as an 'important link between Van Hoogstraten and De Lairesse . 8 Thijs Weststeijn calls Van Hoogstratcns work more ambitious in terms of both theoretical scope and volume' and uses many utterances by Goeree to support his interpretation of Van Hoogstratens text.9 Long before that, Jan Emmens included the works of Van Hoogstraten and Goeree in his analysis of what he called the classicist art criticism' in Rembrandt en de regels van de kunst (1964). 10 Here I will follow another line. I will not look for similarities, nor place the authors on a progressive course. Instead, I will, quite deliberately and to some extent perhaps excessively, take them apart. I have two reasons to do so. The first is that, after reading the texts of both authors, I was struck by the differences rather than by the similarities. Goeree was only eight years younger than Van Hoogstraten and discusses comparable themes, but when reading his texts after those of Van Hoogstraten, one seems at times to enter another world. As I will argue, these differences are related to thoughts and views that went beyond the borders of art practice and theory and were informed by the authors general views on the world, philosophy, nature and science. The second reason is my unease with some of the recent interpretations of the authors. Both men are discussed in relation to the famous philosopher Benedictus de Spinoza (1632-1677). Goeree is typified as a radical, and Van Hoogstraten is also said to have had some relation to the philosopher." We should be careful in identifying direct influences of philosophical schools, but, in comparative perspective, I do think it is possible to discern in Van Hoogstratens writings traits that are, for a large part, rooted in the old humanistic and traditional Aristotelian-scholastic school, not only in his thoughts, but also in the way he transmits these thoughts, while Goerees writings reveal at times traces of the New Philosophy. However, this was far removed from Spinoza. It is true that both authors published their texts in turbulent times - a period when things were rapidly changing in the field of the arts as well as that of the sciences. It was the decade following Rembrandt s death and the same decade that Spinoza died. Traditional studies on the Dutch school of painting tell us that after the death of Rembrandt, a new style emerged that is usually - and somewhat inconveniently - indicated with the term 'Dutch classicism'. The main characteristics of this style were a stronger orientation towards antiquity; a predilection for the 'beautiful'; a general pursuit of clarity, order and harmony; as well as a growing</page><page sequence="4">Regulating the arts. Willem Goeree versus Samuel van Hoogstraten 1 8 J preoccupation with the rules of art. New research over the last decennia made the term Dutch classicism more comprehensive and, as a result, more diffuse. Some studies pointed out that distinct classicist tendencies were present in Dutch art throughout the entire seventeenth century, while several scholars started to pay serious attention to neglected painters of the last decades of the Golden Age. Nevertheless, most art historians do agree that something changed in the art climate in the Republic in the last quarter of the seventeenth century.12 Additionally, the changes in the field of science during this period in the Dutch Republic are much studied and debated. Rienk Vermij gives an outline of the basic tenors elsewhere in this volume.13 In the middle of the century the ideas of René Descartes (1596-1650) had mostly replaced old scholastic and humanistic ways of acquiring knowledge. But the postulations of the French philosopher were discredited by radical and materialist interpretations, which eventually led to the subversive and (supposed) atheistic views of Spinoza. Spinozas ideas about the relation between God and nature left no room for an omnipotent Creator and were seen as an abomination by many. Vermij is quite right to state that Spinozism was very present, but 'rather as a danger to be averted than a position that deserved serious consideration. I think this could also be applied to the cases of Van Hoogstraten and Goeree. My first goal is not to find direct influences of philosophers and scientists on the works of Van Hoogstraten and Goeree. Instead, I will take by comparison a more general approach. Various aspects will be discussed to highlight some significant differences between the two authors. One of the above-mentioned tendencies of the so-called Dutch classicism will play a central role: the growing preoccupation with rules. It is an aspect that is particularly interesting in light of the theme of this volume, since a correlation can be found between the arts and the sciences. In both fields a rational and mathematical rendering of procedures was increasingly emphasized. Traditionally, Dutch classicism is treated as an art-related movement, where alien influences from France and Italy were incorporated into the Dutch school of painting - and subsequently heralded its downfall.14 Recent research emphasizes the broader cultural base of Dutch classicism by discussing it in the context of other artistic fields like architecture, literature and theatre.15 Few attempts were made to link this shift with developments in the field of the natural sciences.16 This might be surprising, because Emmens already mentioned the philosophy of Descartes and the rise of natural sciences as one of the constituting factors of some classicists' opinions.17 He noticed a correlation between some of the main arguments of classicist criticism and Descartes s propagation of the use of a consequent methodology in mathematics.18 Similarly to Descartes s views on gaining knowledge through clear and distinct ideas, writers on art advocated the use of clear and distinct rational (and if possible, mathematical) rules in the creation of art as an alternative for a more practice-based approach. This interesting parallel calls for further exploration, and together, Van Hoogstraten and Goeree form a good case to pursue this. It is also this inclination to mathematize and analyze that forms a distinct contrast</page><page sequence="5">1 88 Gijsbert M. van de Roemer between the two authors. Where Van Hoogstraten presents an almost unrestricted accumulation of data, we discern in Goerees writings a stronger tendency towards the regulation and intellectualization of the arts. These differences become manifest on different levels: in the organization of their chapters, in the way they rendered their information, in their opinions on the intellectual development of the artist and in their general views on the relation between art and nature. These aspects will successively be discussed; however, I will not do justice to the full content of the writings of the authors. More systematic research is certainly needed, especially in the case of the prolific and fascinating polyhistor Willem Goeree. My goal is to reflect comparatively on selections from their writings as a reaction to recent interpretations. In addition, I intend to look at how insights within the history of science can help to illuminate some of the topics discussed by art historians. Chapters Van Hoogstraten and Goeree discuss similar subjects, but the manner in which they commit their thoughts to paper diverge, particularly in how they assemble, order and present their material. The distribution of topics among the chapters can illuminate this. Goeree planned to dedicate his chapters to the seven liberal arts, whereas Van Hoogstraten ordered his chapters according to the nine Muses, the classical goddesses of inspiration. Czech, who has meticulously analyzed Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst , states that the overlaying structure of Van Hoogstratens text does not reveal itself easily.'9 The scheme he presents shows that the authors distribution of the subject matter throughout the chapters is not always coherent. Some chapters are dedicated to one general theme, others seem to alternate between two themes, and some are devoted to one general theme with interlacing sub themes. 20 Yet upon closer examination, Czech asserts, a distinct organization becomes manifest: the chapters represent hierarchically ordered stages of the educational training programme for the young painter. They evocate classes where each Muse represents a step in the learning process, which prompts the student to pass through different subjects. These are, successively, the premises of becoming a painter, and draughtsmanship (Euterpe); human proportions (Polymnia); choice of subject matter (Clio); depicting appropriate settings and surrounding for given subjects (Erato); inventing compositions (Thalia); colour (Terpsichore); the history of painting, and light, shadow and perspective (Melpomene); beauty and grace (Calliope); and finally, the usefulness, virtues and benefits of painting (Urania).21 Czech links the educational disposition of the topics to Descartess didactic appeal to divide difficult subjects into as many parts as possible and to begin with the simplest and ascend to the more complex.22 With this he explains the incoherent, multi-themed chapters. These parts of the text appear only as supplementary subjects ONeben-fächer) in the later chapters, after the student has obtained a basic foundation in the first four chapters. They can be considered as addenda to the main course.</page><page sequence="6">Regulating the arts. Willem Goeree versus Samuel van Hoogstraten 1 89 However, taking the educational programme as clarification might explain some features, but still leaves inconsistencies. For instance, Van Hoogstraten discusses the human anatomy rather early in the second chapter, after a short introduction about draughtsmanship. Considering the didactic principle of advancing from the simple to the complex, this location is surprising because the human body was considered the most complex structure in nature to depict. Its place at the beginning is better explained by the importance of the subject.23 Also, the reasoning behind the position of the expose on the history of painting at the beginning of the chapter about light and perspective is not evident. Czech says it is only useful' when understanding of colour is accomplished, the most important medium of expression.24 But as most stories of the history of painting start with the discovery of drawing an outline, we might expect to find this subject as well in the first chapter, which is partly devoted to draughtsmanship.25 Reading Van Hoogstratens book and studying Czechs illuminating scheme, it is not the lucidity of the organization of the topics that catches the eye, but rather the flexibility with which the author handles his subjects. Maybe Van Hoogstraten is less schematic and ordered than we would like him to be, or rather, he orders his material by premises that are lesser known to us. This will be discussed later, but first I will confront his arrangement with Goerees chapter division. As mentioned previously, Goeree planned a grander work in which all topics about painting would be discussed. These correlate to some extent to Van Hoogstratens topics: the art of drawing, architecture, perspective, the human body, composition and colour. In the Inleyding (...) schilder- konst of 1670 Goeree proposes to structure his chapters according to the artes liberales , and he repeats this intention in the second edition from 1697. Moreover, in this later edition he reacts to Van Hoogstratens chapter division, which was published in the meantime. Goeree speaks about it in a rather amusing, somewhat bantering way.26 He states that the author probably borrowed his idea from Franciscus Junius (1589-1677) and that he embellished it with some nice adornments for pleasure' (aardige dertelheden tot vermaak'). Alternatively, he suggests the artes liberales as a guiding principle and explains how each ars correlates with an aspect of painting. Grammar stands for general knowledge, dialectics for drawing, rhetoric for architecture, music for perspective, arithmetic for anatomy, geometry for ordering inventions, and finally, astronomy for colour.27 From a modern viewpoint it is easier to follow the train of thought behind Goerees order. After an exposé about the general knowledge an artist should posses, the student learns the basic principles of drawing and, subsequently - as a guiding principle - about the binding measurement systems of antique architecture, after which he can practise the rules of perspective. The prominence of the architectural orders in this scheme can be seen as a personal trait of Goeree, since he had a great passion for architecture.28 In the next chapter the trainee learns about the human body. Upon accomplishing all of this, he can combine the two by practising inventing good compositions, which, in the end, must be expressed with colours.</page><page sequence="7">190 G ij s bert M. van de Roemer Each author has a specific way of relating his themes to the different constituents of his adopted system. Van Hoogstratens relations are often brought about by casual and creative association. For instance, he connects Thalia, the muse of comedy, to designing and testing compositions because one should guard against melancholy to order correctly.29 Polymnia, the rhetorician, teaches about human proportions because she represents memory and a student must remember these things.30 Terpsichore stands for colour because she is the most charming of the Muses and wears many coloured feathers.31 And, to give a final example, Melpomene, the muse of tragedy, instructs about light and dark because in tragedy one finds comparable contrasts between happiness and sadness.32 It is possible to give more examples, but we may be missing the point by trying to find the logic behind Van Hoogstratens chapter division. He did not choose this scheme for its substantive suitability to the topic of painting, but for its versatility and fluid character. It was not his aim to create a crystal clear and self-evident scheme, but to find an elaborate mould into which to incorporate his subjects. The ancient and dignified scheme suggested a sense of completeness, coherence and universality, and it enabled him to order his extensive documentation and thoughts. At the same time, it could help as a mnemonic device for trainees.33 In contrast, Goeree did not connect his chapters to mythological figures, choosing instead the more cerebral scheme concerning knowledge and science. The scheme itself leaves less room for playful interpretation, as it does not involve anthropomorphic goddesses with specific features that serve as multifaceted models to articulate his text. Goeree reduces the themes on painting to their concise basic principles and subsequently connects them with the idiosyncratic characteristics of one of the artes . For instance, grammar represents general knowledge because it is needed to read literature; this is the premise for acquiring knowledge. Draughtsmanship equals dialectics, as both aim for truth: the first by arguing and the second by finding true forms. Music parallels perspective because both are based on correct systems of maxims and both offer diversion. And arithmetic equals anatomy because both are concerned with correct numerical relations.34 Thus Goeree presents the act of painting in a context of other intellectual activity. By connecting them to these fields of knowledge he tries to show that the principles of painting are as fundamental and steadfast as those of the liberal arts. The arrangement of the chapters is a first indication of Goerees more intellectual approach and the different analytical mode he applied when writing on the arts. This is also discernable in the organization of the text itself. Text Art historians have commented on the versatility and profusion found in the text of Van Hoogstraten, and sometimes on its lack of unity. Emmens characterized his book as a not unpleasant amalgam' of quotations of earlier authors.35 Weststeijn points to the great variety of sources used by the author, stating that it is pointless to try to fit his theory 'into any</page><page sequence="8">Regulating the arts. Willem Goeree versus Samuel van Hoogstraten I9I specific school of thought'. His book, which contains 'references to both the mediaeval and the mechanistic world view', is better explained with the aid of the rhetorical aims of the author and the epideictic character of the text.36 Ernst van de Wetering states in his recent discussion of Van Hoogstraten that 'it is important to realize that books in Rembrandt's time were not coherent, systematically underpinned arguments, but rather compendious accumulations of knowledge, which could contain chunks of information that were often incompatible'.37 Perhaps these remarks can gain emphasis by making a detour in the history of sciences. In the last decennia historians of science started to work to a greater extent from a broader notion of scientific culture' as an alternative to the grand narratives that dominated their field for so long, such as the Scientific Revolution or the mechanization of the worldview, as well as a fixation on the great names' of science. Next to an interest in the social context of science, they also focused on the different epistemological models and discursive strategies that were used by larger groups to produce and transmit knowledge. To give some examples, Antony Grafton studied the importance of textual transmittance of knowledge and bookish culture; James Bono explored the discursive practices of 'reading the Book of Nature' and noticed a shift from textual exegesis to hermeneutic strategies in the seventeenth century; and Eric Jorink paid attention to the same metaphor in a Dutch context, stressing its importance as a constituting element in the scientific culture of the Republic.38 Of course, the epistemological and discursive modes described by these authors were not restricted to books on nature alone. Texts on other subjects - for instance, the arts - should bear traces of them. To illustrate this, and to help illuminate the difference between Van Hoogstraten and Goeree, I will use a classic article by the historian of science William Ashworth, 'Natural history and the emblematic world view'. Ashworth's goal is to describe some specific characteristics of natural history between 1550 and 1650, for which he introduces the term 'emblematic world view'.39 He explains how the work of naturalists from this period differed fundamentally from the works of their successors. To make a specimen known, they did not restrict themselves to describing the visible features of the specimen and classifying these in a system. They collected all the information they could get about an animal or plant, drawing from many traditions - hieroglyphics, coins and medals, Aesopic fables, classical mythology, adages, epigrams, emblems and devices. This accumulation of data was considered the core of natural history, and only later were the specimens 'scraped clean' from 'their crust of analogies, resemblances and signs'.40 In the second half of the seventeenth century, naturalists started to focus exclusively on the perceptible features of the specimens, which eventually resulted in an emphasis on classification. Even though Ashworth's inciting expose has some generalizing dangers, I do think his notions can be used to mark the contrast between Van Hoogstraten and Goeree more sharply.41 Whereas the former was more imbedded in what we could call a 'bookish', 'emblematic', 'compiling' or 'accumulative' way of producing and transmitting knowledge, the latter shows signs of a more systematic and analytical</page><page sequence="9">192 Gijsbert M. van de Roemer approach to unfolding his thoughts. Van Hoogstratens chapters are compilations of information that are based partly on his own experiences in the workshop and partly on what he read or heard elsewhere, for which he used an abundant quantity of classical and contemporary sources.42 Loosely inspired by general themes, he threads chains of interesting data that might be useful for the young artist and interlards it with a multitude of quotations, stories and experiences. Compared to Goeree, his focus is more on the sequence of the narrative than on the systematic structure of the total text. When this style of research is taken for granted as a different mode to process and transmit knowledge, it becomes less necessary to find explanations for the perceived inconsistencies and the way he wanders sometimes from one subject to another. Two examples will illustrate this. In the sixth chapter, Van Hoogstraten discusses colours. He stresses the importance of knowledge about this subject, but instead of practical information about the characteristics of specific pigments and the way they should be applied, his emphasis is on - to follow Ashworths words - an emblematic discussion of colours. He gives some practical remarks about which pigments are used by modern painters, but the greater part of the text concerns aspects such as to which planets the colours correspond and the virtues and vices they represent. So we read that white belongs to the Moon and blue to Jupiter, that the mixture of gold and blue stands for the lust of the world and that gold and grey stand for meticulousness.43 In the following sections, Van Hoogstraten gives practical advice - for instance, that friendly colours mix well and hostile colours do not, and that one should follow the colours in nature - but specific information with regards to actual practice in the studio is relatively limited.44 It would be illuminating to confront this with Goerees treatment of colours, but sadly this part of the project was never written. Goeree did publish an adaptation of a treatise on watercolours by Gerard ter Brugge, two years before his Inleyding (...) schilder-konst . In it he gives detailed information about the practice of using colours: the preparation of paints, some characteristics of the pigments, the implements used, an overview of 32 pigments, how to prepare paints, how to apply them, how to keep them and what colours to use to depict skies, clouds, walls, rooms, flesh, hair, trees, wooden objects, cities, castles, rocks and all sorts of animals, fruits, vegetables, flowers and minerals. A one-to-one comparison is hazardous, but we can use this little book to show what Van Hoogstraten did not tell. Even though Van de Wetering convincingly showed that Van Hoogstraten s book should be taken for what it is, a manual for the young artist, many things the author recounts do not directly relate to the act of painting. This is not to say that his information was not useful for the painter. On the contrary, it shows that the field of knowledge that Van Hoogstraten considered suitable for the painter expanded in many divergent directions. A second example will illustrate the authors accumulative manner of collecting data. In the fourth chapter, concerning the correct settings and details for certain scenes, he spends eighteen pages discussing hairstyles, clothing, weapons and armour. Van Hoogstraten sums up what he</page><page sequence="10">Regulating the arts: Samuel van Hoogstraten versus Willem Goeree 1 93 believes is appropriate and assembles fragments of information that can be useful. Thus the reader learns about the washed hair of Spartans, the beard of Charles V, the clothing of Persians, Egyptians, Romans and Russians, and about the Devil. Of course these things can be useful for the young artist, because he wants to know how to depict things, but sometimes the necessity of what the author does and does not tell is elusive. Revealing with regard to this manner of thinking is the concluding remark after his long digression: 'I avoid to speak of offerings, slaughter knives, axes, basins, cover cloths, and festoons, and only mention what pleases me and comes into mind'.45 Again we see here an author who freely assembles information from a multitude of sources. Goeree is just as long-winded as Van Hoogstraten, often even more so. His manner of recounting can also be, at times, associative.46 But in contrast to Van Hoogstratens train of thought, we notice in Goeree s text from time to time another mode of structuring his material, a more systematic way of unfolding his thoughts and instructing the trainee. (That is not to say 'better or more scientific, but at the most more recognizable' for the modern reader.) This becomes clear in the way he discusses the human body in Natuurlyk en schilderkonstig ontwerp der menschkunde^ from 1682. He treats each body part separately, beginning at the head and ending at the back. In almost every section, Goeree follows the same procedure. He discusses first the construction and function (maaksel en diensť), and then by the appearances and the physiognomic readings of specific traits. And so he discusses hair, countenance, forehead, brows, eyes, nose, ears, cheeks, mouth, lips, tongue, teeth, chin, neck, arms, hands, fingers, armpits, breasts, belly, navel, legs, feet, buttocks, back and skin.47 Instead of the somewhat random variety presented by Van Hoogstraten, we see here an author striving systematically for completeness. Goeree s aspiration to capture the diversity of the human body in all its appearances shows classifying tendencies. He even talks about different classes (gęsiach ten), when he tries to map the diverse features of the countenance. He discusses the features in running text, but with little effort we can translate his divisions into a taxonomy: 1 . Hair a. bristly b. curly c. straight 2. forehead a. flat and smooth b. hollow c. full and round I. full and round above II. full and round below III. full and round above and below</page><page sequence="11">194 GijsbertM. van de Roemer 3. nose a. completely I. straight II. flat III. uniformly hollow IV. uniformly elevated (hooked) b. somewhat flat or elevated c. above straight, below hollow d. above straight, below elevated e. above hollow, below straight f. above hollow, below elevated g. above elevated, below straight h. above elevated, below hollow 4. mouth a. small lips b. big lips c. curled lips 5. chin a. short b. long c. thick d. hollow e. round48 This systematic method of description also appears in his discussion of the stances of the head. He distinguishes four classes of the upright stance, of which the first two classes have no variations (from the front and from the back), the third class has two variations (from the side: from the left and from the right) and the fourth class has many variations (receding, in many gradations; see fig. i). Goeree calls these upright positions natural' and sets them apart from what he calls coincidental' positions. These are divided into two basic classes: the first is receding forwards or backwards, the second receding left or right. These two classes can be combined together in many variations, and the classes of the 'natural' stances can also be transposed on them. Later in the book, with the description of bodily movements, he follows the same procedure and divides them into seven classes.49 By modern standards Goeree's classifications still harbour many inconsistencies and are surely not very elaborate - sometimes even amusing. But compared to Van Hoogstraten, his way of informing the reader and instructing the trainee shows signs that are fundamentally different. It is based not on an alignment of data, but on a method of analysis where the material he wants to pass on is ordered and classified. The way Goeree does this is not compulsory. Just as Van Hoogstraten does, he likes to show off his knowledge and expose his erudition. He recounts stories, gives advice, and outlines things he has heard and read, but in between the stories and recollections we see a Goeree who is observing, analyzing and classifying. The desire to systemize is certainly present.</page><page sequence="12">Regulating the arts.

(Amsterdam 1682), Universiteitsbibliotheek Amsterdam (UvA), Bijzondere Collecties, O 61-6997. Knowledge Having explored some structural elements of the texts, I will now turn to the content. Earlier I mentioned a preoccupation with the rules of the arts as a characteristic of classicism. This coincided with a more knowledgeable approach to the arts. Both authors advocate a well- instructed and informed painter, but they hold different opinions about the extent and character of this knowledge. Whereas Van Hoogstraten states that both head and hand should be skilled at the same time, Goeree thinks the head should be trained first.50 Goeree, like most so-called classicists, tried to relocate the art of painting from the domain of the hand to the domain of the brain. He fulminates against the practical attitude prevalent among artists in the Republic, about whom he states</page><page sequence="13">196 G ij s bert M. van de Roemer that the art lies not in their brains, but in their fingertips.51 An artist should not begin painting without reflective knowledge Obeschouwige kennis') of many things. To underline this he gives a survey of nearly one hundred titles of recommended books concerning history, antiquity, mathematics, land surveying, architecture, natural philosophy, natural history and human anatomy.52 Van Hoogstraten also emphasizes the importance of knowledge in many places, and even calls the art of painting - as it is often cited - a science' ('wetenschap').53 He, too, acknowledges the benefits of natural philosophy, history, poetry and mathematics,54 but in other instances he also expresses his reservations about too much learning. A premise seems to be that the acquired knowledge should be directly applicable to the act of painting itself. When discussing the arrangement of compositions, he states that knowledge (wetenschap') alone will help little; sketching and practice will be of greater value.55 Likewise, he utters his scepticism with regard to reading books on human anatomy. He wonders who has time and the desire to read Vesalius, Laurentius or Cabrolius. Even the work of Jacob van der Gracht (1593-1652) - an author who published an anatomy book especially for the artist - seems to him more applicable to surgeons than to painters. In comparison, Goeree numbers the works of Vesalius, Spiegelius, Vestingius, Van der Gracht and Bartholinus among his recommended literature. Both authors aim at artistic knowledge, but Van Hoogstraten presents many diverging and interesting data with the act of painting as a point of departure, while Goeree more often starts outside the act of painting and seeks knowledge that can feed the process. The case of anatomy can serve as a good example to further illuminate the disparity. Again, a comparison might seem somewhat inappropriate, since Goeree wrote an entire book about the human body and Van Hoogstraten discusses it only in the second chapter of his treatise, but that the latter needed only 31 pages, whereas Goeree needed 432, may serve as an indicator of his more knowledgeable approach. According to Goeree, proportions change with every movement, which is why an artist should also know about the functions and the mechanics of the body parts.56 He discusses these things extensively, giving an overview of the different measuring systems of the human body. In contrast, Van Hoogstraten keeps his information limited and recounts only what he considers useful for the painter. This consists mainly of reproductions of five prints depicting bodies of men, women and children with explanatory tables and measuring systems (fig. 2). 57 Van Hoogstraten confirms that copying these prints and learning the names on the tables by heart is sufficient to make a young artist 'fully qualified' . Even though he suggests the possibility of further study ('for those who want thať), he warns against a profusion of measurements.58 The case of perspective serves as a second example to emphasize the authors' distinct views on artistic scholarship. Several times, Van Hoogstraten stresses the importance of this science, stating that it is impossible to make good art without it, yet dedicates only three pages to the topic. He does not explain perspective, but gives - in his known accumulative way - a small collection of stories of persons who applied it</page><page sequence="14">Regulating the arts.

Like Van Hoogstraten, Goeree stresses the importance of perspective, but instead of recounting stories, he chooses one distinct method. He declares himself an adherent to the finding of the French mathematician and engineer Girard Desargues (1591-1661) and considers this to be an understandable method based on steady foundations', which equates to mathematics. It can be applied perfectly to the arts, inspiring certainty and even enabling an artist to measure the distances of depicted objects in</page><page sequence="15">198 Gijsbert M. van de Roemer three-dimensional space.61 Goeree never wrote his chapter on this topic, but a treatise titled Perspectiva of Doorzichtkunde was published in 1703 by his younger friend and protege, Dirk Bosboom (c. 1648-c. 1707). 62 The content of this work corresponds remarkably to the plan Goeree uttered in 1670: a discussion of Desarguess method, preceded by a long digression on the nature of light, the construction of the human eye and its functioning. Bosbooms views on optics were, to a large extent, based on the insights of Descartes.63 The reader learns in detail that light is caused by the straightforward movement of subtle matter and that it moves in straight lines into the eyes of the beholder. After this 30-page expose, he turns to the method of Desargues. This stands in sharp contrast to Van Hoogstraten, who states in his discussion about light and perspective that he will bypass what philosophers have said about the nature of light and recounts only what is needed for the artist.64 The method Goeree and Bosboom propagated was known to be too intellectual and rational for the everyday artist. In The science of art, Martin Kemp describes how in the first half of the seventeenth century Desargues, who was influenced by Descartess analytic geometry, developed a new means to create the illusion of depth on a flat plane. On the basis of projective geometry, he tried to replace the old Renaissance method of the checker-board floor with a more accurate, mathematically grounded method. In France, after a brief proliferation, the method was considered too theoretical and unpractical for artists and was expelled from the French academy by Charles Le Brun (1619-1690).65 Nevertheless, apparently Goeree and Bosboom found it fit to spread among Dutch artists. Bosboom and Goeree also explain why painters should know these basic fundamentals that seem so far removed from the daily practice in the workshops. Bosboom emphasizes the importance by stating that an artist who has acquired knowledge of these matters will be able to rely on it in the future and will find solutions to all kinds of painterly problems.66 Otherwise, one has to rely on untrustworthy chance, and, as Bosboom adds, 'Guessing is mistaking' ('Gissing maakt missing'). Goeree thinks likewise. In his Inleyding (...) schilder-konst he stresses the importance of fundamental knowledge and states that things such as draughtsmanship, architecture, perspective, anatomy, ordering and colours should be learned at an early age. One should not step over them too hastily, but an enlightened mind should explore them and learn to govern them. This has to precede the creation of art and is a premise for good art. Apart from the direct influence of Descartes, some distinct features of the analytical thinking of the New Philosophy can be found in Goeree s and Bosbooms approaches. On different levels they attempt to reduce the procedure of painting to some clear basic principles that would form the fundamentals on which an artist could rely. While Van Hoogstraten is presenting a rich tapestry consisting of diverse information about painting, Goeree is trying to unstitch the different threads of which it is made. It is clear that basic knowledge of human anatomy and physiology can help to depict characters in paintings and that mathematics and optics are needed for correct rendering of perspective, light and shade, but also the way Goeree</page><page sequence="16">Regulating the arts. Willem Goeree versus Samuel van Hoogstraten 199 classifies the countenances and gestures can serve as an example of bringing complex things back to some simple basics. He states that an artist who has imprinted the basic classes of the face' ('tronie-geslachten') in his mind will easily be able to depict someone he has seen only once. He must look for the general model in his head that corresponds with the impression of the observed person and can then fill in the basic form with further details.67 Rules and chance The aforementioned characteristics of Goeree s work do not conform to Weststeijns interpretation of the text. He uses the writer to suggest a relationship between Van Hoogstratens concept of depicting the visible world' and Spinozas natura sive Deus, in which the concept of the visible and invisible world overlap, and transposes the supposed influence of Spinoza on Goeree to Van Hoogstraten.68 But Weststeijns reading of Goeree is incomplete. He states: ťIn Goerees view it is not the universal fundamental principles that concern the artisť.69 The writer was 'basing the significance of the depiction of nature not in the study of ideal beauty, but precisely in the fact that nature is "unfathomably rich in bringing forth multitudes of every species (...)"'.7° Also, Goeree is supposed to have come to 'radical conclusions' that 'beauty is a relative phenomenon , which is further discussed in connection to Spinozas views.71 However, many of the views cited by Weststeijn are actually paraphrased by Goeree in order to refute them. This can be corroborated by citing quotes wherein Goeree airs his own opinion instead of those of others. In Menschkunde he reacts to philosophers' who suggest beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and he counters this by stating it (...) is in general not true of all true beauty, certainly not of that [beauty] which is mainly based on sound reasoning and on the equilateral proportional compositions of the parts to the whole.72 The author expresses here the traditional notion from classical architectural theory that defines 'true' beauty as a design in which the relations between all parts of a composition must agree with the harmonious whole, so that nothing could be changed without its disruption.73 It is clear that Goeree presupposed a fundamental beauty that goes beyond the human experience and is inherent to things. He does not refer to cosmological analogies or heavenly harmonies, but relates it directly to truth found in mathematics. He admits that sometimes beauty might elude the ignorant beholder, but that it will remain true 'like a mathematical truth [that] can rely on itself'. The excursions above already demonstrate that Goeree did target basic fundamentals in order to buttress the practice of painting. His texts on art - and also on world history, for that matter74 - show a preoccupation with rules and regularity that is often expressed in a mathematical way. In six of his seven explanations of the chapters, discussed earlier, he uses phrases</page><page sequence="17">200 Gijsbert M. van de Roemer like 'distinct order , sure measurements' or according measure'. This wish to regulate and mathematize was certainly not new in art theory; but it is justified to assume that these old notions acquired a fresh radiance in this period due to new insights in the field of natural philosophy. This blended with his religious convictions. The following significant quotation shows this: And like God has laid in all parts of his Creation mathematical rules, according to which nature produces, retains and destroys her works, so the goodness of the same Creator bestowed such an ingenuity upon men that they found themselves infallible rules, to imitate nature.75 We should not too easily disregard these remarks as commonplace. Rather, I believe they formed the frame of reference from which Goeree wrote about the arts. Goerees opinions on art found footing in a fluid merging of notions from classicist art theory, Protestant beliefs and the New Philosophy. These were the three constituents of his thinking. He was convinced that men should produce art according to the same regular procedures with which God governed his creation. For him the Biblical notion that God created everything according to measure, number and weight - a notion described in the Book of Wisdom, and to which he refers explicitly - was as directive as the new mathematical insights of Descartes and his followers.76 He felt no opposition between these views, but regarded them as two truths that confirmed each other. It also informed his view on arts. As the quotation shows, in Goerees thinking there is no sign of equating God with nature. On the contrary, he conceived nature as a precise and mathematical artwork crafted and ruled by the Supreme Artist. The reciprocal relation between God and nature was clear-cut, and because of this relation nature could function as a double-layered example for art. Goeree mentions imitation as an end goal, but the parallel between art and nature goes further than mere mimesis: nature not only supplies the examples that art should follow, but also reveals the processes by which this imitation should be accomplished. More explicitly stated, the regularity with which God moved matter in his creation serves as an example for men when utilizing artistic materials in order to create works of art. There was hardly anything radical about this, though some orthodox thinkers may have frowned upon these words. Goeree did not need Spinozas natura sive Deus to solve the paradox between the res cogitans and res extensa posed by Descartes.77 If his thoughts coincided with a philosophical school at all, it would be wiser to turn to the ideas that were simultaneously developed outside the Dutch Republic, in England. There, thinkers associated with the Royal Society, like Robert Boyle (1627-1691) and John Ray (1627-1705), developed a research strategy where the mechanistic interpretation of nature was used as a confirmation of Gods omnipotent power. A direct influence is not tenable, but the ideas these researchers developed and laid down in their writings coincided with the opinions of many writers and researchers in the Dutch Republic: a fertile combination of the New Philosophy and Calvinist</page><page sequence="18">Regulating the arts. Willem Goeree versus Samuel van Hoogstraten 20I beliefs, which could be used as an antidote for the atheistic tendencies within an overly materialist view on nature.78 An important feature of this view was the increasing consideration of nature as a work of art. This metaphor was not as clearly defined as that of the Book of Nature, and it had many guises: nature as painting, nature as clockwork, nature as automaton or nature as embroidery. But in the minds of researchers of the late seventeenth century it was certainly as vibrant as the Book of Nature analogy. Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park explain in Wonders and the order of nature , 1150-1750 how, due to mechanistic philosophy, this metaphor of nature as arť gained vigour and replaced the older notion of nature as artisť. In the beginning of the seventeenth century, congruent with the scholastic Aristotelian views, Nature was seen as a maid or a worker of God. She was totally dependent upon her Creator, but was still allowed some autonomy. Nature harboured hidden powers and qualities, and this enabled her to err, to paint or to play. These perceptions eroded under the rise of mechanistic natural philosophy's influence. Natures limited autonomy and her anthropomorphic character faded, and it - because she now became an 'it' - was seen eventually as a construct assembled from tiny particles that moved with mathematical regularity. This construct was incredible in its complexity, but in the end inert and a thing made . 'The ancient opposition of nature and art had been transformed into an opposition between the works of God and the works of man. Nature had become "the Art of God", no longer able to create art of her own . 79 Did these broad notions somehow affect the practice in the studios in the Dutch Republic, and can they help to delineate the difference between Goeree and Van Hoogstraten further? In looking for an answer it can be illuminating to, as a last excursion, pay some attention to those aspects of the artistic practice that eluded a rational or quantitative approach. For instance, the absence of a regularized system for mixing and applying colours was still felt as a deficiency by many. Goerees explanation for connecting his chapter on colour to astronomy is telling in this respect. He binds the two because of their shared lack of certainty: just like astronomers had to guess the partly invisible orbits of the planets, artists had to guess the outcome of colour mixtures.80 Others also noticed a gap in this knowledge. In his Groot schilderboeĶ Gerard de Lairesse (1640-1711) contrasts applying colour with anatomy and perspective, and finds it 'remarkable' that there are still no ground rules for this part of painting.81 When autodidact Pieter Rabus (1660-1702) wrote in his Boekzaal a review on a little treatise on painting, he stated that the nature of basic paints belonged to philosophy, but that no person until now was able to demonstrate mathematically how paints were used and how colours were mixed.82 By the absence of clear rules, the artist had to rely on practice and chance. But chance itself was being challenged. Rabuss phrase until now' suggests that he thought this problem might be solved in the future. Also, Bosbooms guessing is missing' discredits chance as something to rely on in producing art. As mechanistic natural philosophy tried to deny the existence of chance in nature, writers on art that honoured the classicist principles tried to eliminate chance from the process of painting.</page><page sequence="19">202 Gijsbert M. van de Roemer According to them, representatives of the older schools of painting relied too much on the fortuitous outcome of their manual skills.83 Painters like Rembrandt and his last pupil, Arent de Gelder (1647-1727), served as negative examples. These artists deliberately used the uncertain outcome of brush strokes as a substantial part of their working process. One of the most famous examples of this bold manner of painting, with loose brushstrokes and dripping impasto, is the gold brocade sleeve of the male sitter in Rembrandts Jewish bride . The painting and the sleeve were eloquently described by Ernst van de Wetering: '(•••) it almost appears to be the outcome of a geological process; in some elusive way chance seems to have played an important part in this manner of painting'.84 In contrast to what classicist criticizers might have thought, Van de Wetering attests in his discussion of two self-portraits of Rembrandt that this reliance on chance must have been a conscious choice in the act of painting.85 An artist could allow the effects of chance to create convincing illusions by activating the beholders imagination, a phenomenon coined by Gombrich as 'the beholders share'.86 Compared to Goeree, Van Hoogstraten was still more open towards an accidental and less controlled way of working. For instance, he advocates a rough way of sketching {in gros) that the artist should apply to recognize shapes in the different, imprecise forms. He advises starting with indicating the bigger forms roughly and then working towards the details while searching for forms. This way of working is for him the basis of good drawing, which is again the basis of good painting.87 For Van Hoogstraten, chance was still an option, even though he also pleads in many cases for more regularized procedures. Elucidating in this respect is the story he recounts about the painting contest between the painters François Knibbergen, Jan van Goyen and Jan Porcellis.88 The goal was to finish a painting as quickly as possible. Each artist represented a distinct way of working. Knibbergen painted figures on his canvas as letters written with a pen (a painter relying on his habits and tricks). Van Goyen first filled the entire panel with paint like a many coloured agate or marbled paper' and found thus shapes and figures that he accentuated from the chaos (a painter relying on chance and his imagination). Porcellis first took his time to make an elaborate design in his head and then started to work (a painter relying on his intellect). Despite that all three paintings were fairly good, the outcome demonstrated that the method of the latter led to better results, because Porcellis acted certain and sure' (zeker en gewis'). Here Van Hoogstraten manifests as a mouthpiece for a more intellectual approach, but, on the other hand, the example shows that chance' was still an option for painters. It is this accidental method of creation that was refuted by Goeree and Bosboom. The tension between chance as a legitimate working procedure and a more controlled and regulated approach to the arts can pose some interesting questions for further investigation. In art history the scrutinizing research into the chemical formula of pigments, the complex recipes for paints and varnishes, the quantity of threads in canvases and the number of growth rings in wooden panels have not yet inspired questions about the basic premises with which early modern artists</page><page sequence="20">Regulating the arts. Willem Goeree versus Samuel van Hoogstraten 203 considered their materials. Did representatives of the old schools see nature as a productive force, which in itself could help or stimulate the artistic process? Could the qualities inhabiting the pigments in paints contribute to a greater effect of illusionism? Did painters who used chance in their technique paint not only 'after nature, but also with' nature? Did the concept of natural products as a congregation of inert corpuscles that move according to mathematical laws contribute in any way to the diminishment of this way of working? Probably these questions were far removed from daily life in the studio, but in the end it must have made a difference whether an artist saw his working materials as substances preserving overt and hidden qualities, or as congregations of tiny corpuscles that move and act according to mathematical regularity. The wish to bind art to the same regular laws with which creation was governed became stronger in the first decades of the eighteenth century. In the Dutch Republic it found its most pronounced advocate in Lambert ten Kate (1674-1731), who is the focus of the essay by Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis elsewhere in this volume. Apart from precise calculations of human proportions, Ten Kate experimented with mathematical ratios for mixing colours and thus tried to fulfil an absence that was felt by many, as expressed before in the words of Rabus and De Lairesse. Hessel Miedema, who meticulously studied the correspondence between Ten Kate and the painter Hendrik van Limborch (1681-1759), describes their reflections. The two discussed anatomy and colour theory extensively, while Van Limborch functioned as an executor of Ten Kate s ideas. They devoted much effort to finding correct mathematical relations, but their findings were not very successful.89 In the end, the gap between theory and everyday practice was too big. It seems that, with the perspective method of Desargues and the colour experiments of Ten Kate, the regulation and quantification of the arts had reached its limits. Art and science could no longer inform each other without discrediting their respective endeavours. Art was soon to find another direction. The irrefutable objective gradually made way for a more subjective approach to the arts, which eventually led to the new discipline of aesthetics. Science and art lost their shared, solid base of objective truths, and the bond between them was loosened. However, for men like Goeree, Bosboom and Ten Kate, this bond was still crystal clear and formed a premise for their reflections on art.
