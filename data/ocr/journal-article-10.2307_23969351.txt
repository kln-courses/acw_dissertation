<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yahweh Fighting from Heaven. God as Warrior and as God of Heaven in the Hebrew Psalter and Ancient Near Eastern Iconography. By Martin Klingbeil. Pp. xii + 361. (Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis, 169.) Univer sity Fribourg Switzerland/Gôttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1999. isbn 3 7278 1250 8 and 3 525 53678 x. SFr 108. Martin Klingbeil has produced a most interesting and stimu lating study, but a frustrating one as well. His concern is with one dominant metaphor—that of God fighting from heaven— and he identifies a number of psalms which represent God in this way (Psalms 2g and 65 which refer to the God of heaven, Psalms 21 and 46 which depict God as a warrior, and Psalms 18, 68, 83, and 144 in which these metaphors overlap). Having offered an exegesis of each psalm where the metaphor occurs, Klingbeil then assembles an impressive array of ancient Near Eastern iconographie material under similar categories—gods with 'warrior' attributes, gods with 'god of heaven' attributes, and gods with both 'warrior' and 'god of heaven' attributes. In the final part of the book Klingbeil compares the textual evidence from the psalms with the iconographie symbols, and in some eight pages of conclusion he draws out the implications of such a comparison. This is a cautious and careful piece of work, and herein lie the frustrations—for this reader, at least. The style is prosaic, and at times clumsy and awkward: the use of the present continuous tense ('The research is proceding (sic) from a general survey of metaphors ...,' p. 7) and the number of split infinitives, to use just one example, mean that the English does not flow particularly smoothly. Furthermore, the footnotes tend to dominate the ana lysis: many pages contain more annotation and comment than text, and this again prevents continuous reading of the argument itself.</page><page sequence="2">156 REVIEWS The exegesis of the selected psalms, similarly careful and judi cious, is so focused on arguing that a selected psalm does indeed contain the metaphors of God fighting from heaven, that little space is given to analysing what implications this has for our understanding of these psalms. The same problem of balance is evidenced in the two long discussions of the theory of metaphor (chapter 3.1) and the comparative method (chapter 6.1), where the relationship between the theories and the following analysis is not always clear. The study contains some twenty-three tables (most of which outline the verbal and nominal forms in each of the selected psalms) and fifteen graphs: although some of these were most useful, the tables produce a good deal of repetition in the semantic notes on the same verbs and nouns in different psalms: what one really wanted was to see what difference these forms might make to our reading of one psalm in connection with another. Similarly in the array of iconographical images, there are times when the thoroughness of the scholarship undermines the clarity and the significance of the argument. Klingbeil uses a chrono logical framework from the beginning of the monarchy to the time of the restoration, and a geographical framework which focuses on Syro-Palestine whilst taking in the whole of the Ancient Near East. Such a vast extent of material means that many of the examples (some twenty of the ninety-three given) have little or no evidence of a Syro-Palestinian context, so the possibility of even indirect influence from the image to the psalm is very slim. Furthermore, many of the motifs chosen—the god with the winged sun-disk, or the sacred palm-tree—did not always seem to bear directly upon the metaphor of God as warrior from heaven. The reader feels drowned with information but at times denied much appropriate analysis: hence the frustration. But in many other ways Klingbeil has produced a most enga ging book. His key point is that the composers of the selected psalms were very much affected by the iconographie imagery of the Ancient Near East, and that their particular monotheistic outlook (whether incipient or explicit), far from inhibiting their poetry, gave it an additional creativity as they were compelled to borrow and adapt. Klingbeil is not the first to be interested in iconographie influences upon the psalmists: it is no coincidence that the book (once a Stellenbosch University dissertation) has been published by the University of Fribourg, and the debt to scholars in the Fribourg School is duly acknowledged (O. Keel and Ch. Uehlinger being well-known names) from the period of doctoral study which the author spent in Switzerland. However,</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 157 it is Klingbeil's concentration on just one metaphor—God fight ing from heaven—which gives the study its distinctiveness: at least it affords him a focus and enables him to combine an exegesis of a small number of psalms with a description of a relevant number of iconographical images. The book offers many interesting insights. After the discussion of biblical metaphor, Klingbeil presents an important survey of metaphors of God in the Psalter as a whole—metaphors depicting God's body (his face, ears, eyes, eyelids, mouth, lips, arms, palms, fingers, feet, wings, and hands) and metaphors depicting God in heaven (for example, as king, refuge, warrior, judge, rock, shield, shepherd, deliverer, host and father). The sheer range of anthropomorphic imagery becomes apparent from this table; particularly interesting is the way that Klingbeil shows how the range of metaphors changes within the five books of the Psalter (for example, the imagery of God as warrior is not found in Books Four and Five; the preponderance of this imagery is in Book One). Also interesting were the brief (tantalisingly brief) conclusions at the end of the analysis of each psalm. Psalm 18 presents the image of God fighting from heaven by means of giving natural phenomena supernatural significance; Psalm 21 speaks of God fighting from heaven by describing the weapons at God's disposal; Psalm 46 draws from the primordial traditions of creation and chaos; Psalm 65 develops the image by describing God as giver of rain and fertility; Psalm 68 does this by way of the Exodus/ Sinai and Conquest traditions; and Psalm 144, a much later psalm, by revitalising the traditions of Moses and the early mon archy. So in each case, the psalmist utilises particular 'Israelite' traditions in order to depict the more universal Ancient Near-Eastern motif of God as fighting from heaven. Klingbeil organises the vast array of iconographical material into 'motif groups'. For the gods as warriors, he includes depic tions of the smiting god, archer scenes, the god with a spear, the god/dess in arms. (Most of these examples are clear and fascinat ing.) Examples of the gods in heaven are perhaps less convincing because they really are more diffuse: the god in the winged sundisk, the water-providing god, the sacred palm tree, the goddess in the star nimbus, the celestial throne, the god/dess in creation, the winged sphinx and the winged god/dess. The final 'motif group' offers examples of where the god and heaven and the warrior god imagery are found together, and works better: there are illustrations of smiting gods with vegetation spears, or with bundles of lightning; weather gods, standing on mountains, or fighting snakes, or at arms; and gods in a winged sundisk with a</page><page sequence="4">158 REVIEWS bow. For this reviewer, by far the most helpful part of this ana lysis, when taken alongside the earlier table of the metaphorical language used of God throughout the psalms, is the Appendix, which presents all the iconographical images together, as line drawings; this allows an impressionistic comparison between the anthropomorphic world of psalmody in the use of the word pictures (which always depict God in ultimate control over the nation and the cosmos) and the anthropomorphic world of icono graphy with its artistic symbolism (where often the gods appear more vulnerable and less in ultimate control). Klingbeil's conclusions, based upon his observation that the warrior-god metaphor dominates the first three books of the Psalter, is that the imagery of God fighting from heaven was freely borrowed from the Ancient Near-Eastern world in the period before the exile, but that (as far as the Psalter was concerned, at least), the metaphor lost its popularity after the exile, when the affairs of the nation and questions of its military might were less to the fore. This was the time when the final two books of the Psalter were being added to Books One to Three: hence the dis appearance of this metaphor from the psalms in Books Four and Five. Although Klingbeil's theory begs questions about how much we know concerning the chronological development of the Psalter as a whole (for example, whether the first three books really contain 'earlier' psalms, and the last two books, 'later' ones), it nevertheless raises a most interesting question about the effect of the rise of monotheism in the exile upon the anthropomorphic depiction of God as Warrior. And at this particular period in our own world history, when religion and warfare seem to be such an explosive mix in the land which was once known as 'Syro Palestine', Klingbeil's observations about the gradual disappear ance of the warrior-god metaphor within the Psalter offer timely reflections, to say the least.
