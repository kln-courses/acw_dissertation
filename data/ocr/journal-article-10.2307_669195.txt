GOODALE, Bryn Mawr College Native art (that produced by nonliterate peoples throughout the world) is achieving a prominence of appreciation among the literate peoples of the world amounting almost to a cult. Partial evidence of this is the exhibition of such art in increasing numbers of art galleries, in the fantastically rising prices in the curio market, and last but not least, in the rapidly increasing numbers of expensively produced art books dealing with such art. According to one of the authors (Tuckson) in the book being reviewed here, the cult was slow to arrive in Australia, and this book appears to be aimed at Australians in particular; however it should be of interest to "cult" members everywhere. Native art has, of course, been "appreciated" for many years: ethnographic museums are full of specimens, many on display to the public with traditionally long labels, explaining the meaning or symbolism of the object on view in terms of its function and use in the technology and/or religion of the culture and people of its provenience. To the anthropologist appreciation is impossible without knowledge of the cultural context. However, the rise of the cult itself appears to be evidence that this knowledge is not absolutely essential to appreciation by nonanthropologists. Presumably, the truth lies somewhere in between these two points of view, and in editing Australian Aboriginal Art Berndt has shown admirable discretion in selecting authors, all authorities in their field, who, however, differ in their approaches to the interpretation of aboriginal art. Four of the five authors, and the editor himself, present a variety of anthropological viewpoints. Mountford, "The Art of Arnhem Land," deals primarily with the mythological</page><page sequence="2">1574 American Anthropologist [67, 19651 interpretations which he and others have gathered from the native artists themselves, although in many cases the name of the artist was considered unimportant to record, indicative of the view that the individual in art, as in society, is less important to the study than the art or society itself. McCarthy, "The Art of the Rock Faces," uses an historical approach to apprecia- tion. On the evidence of superimposition of various techniques and styles, his discussion covers a time period of unknown depth. Where evidence of diffusion and other external influence is known or suspected it is indicated up to and including the appearance of airplanes and motor cars in the most recent period. In this chapter we are given a feel- ing for the dynamic quality of aboriginal art and through it a reflection of the ever- changing nature of aboriginal culture, however imperceptable in other ways. Strehlow, in dealing with the art of Central Australia in a chapter entitled "The Art of Circle, Line, and Square," gives perhaps the best picture of what the art means to the individual in the culture. This is undoubtedly due to a number of factors, not the least of which is his own personal involvement in the aboriginal culture of the Center, but also because, in his own words, Central Australian pictorial art was never able to achieve its full emotional appeal without the help of a different medium-the medium of sacred verse. Because of this, the pictorial art of Central Australia will probably always (sic) rank, at least in the eyes of alien observers, lower than the anthropomorphic and X-ray designs of northern and western coastal Australia. But in one sense, because of their integral connection with poetic songs and ritual action, they are infinitely more subtle; and they should be evaluated in these terms. (p. 50) Strehlow's description of a child telling a story and at the same time illustrating it with symbolic designs drawn with her finger in the sand, and relating this technique to the symbolic designs on sacred objects, achieved an order of appreciation in this re- viewer's mind which no previous discussion had been able to do. Tuckson, the one nonanthropologist, represents the art historian and museum director's approach to aboriginal art in his chapter, "Aboriginal Art and the Western World." After recounting the history of appreciation (or rather nonappreciation) of aboriginal art outside of ethnographic museums, he chooses several selected styles to discuss from the artistic point of view. He ends by making a very strong appeal for the appreciation as well as the utilization of this art by both White and black Australian artists of today. Elkin, in an introductory chapter "Art and Life," and Berndt in his "Preface," give an overview of the role that art plays in the aboriginal culture and in the "Epi- logue" Berndt discusses the future of this art. All of the authors treat in detail the technical aspects of the various art forms and an entire section is devoted to more specific details of the illustrated works. The illustrations themselves are selected with a view for individual excellence rather than a complete coverage of all the forms and styles mentioned in the text. However, the coverage is good and the reproductions are, on the whole, excellent. A few line drawings are included in the text which the reviewer found so useful that she wishes there were many more. There is a map, belatedly placed on the next to last page of the text.</page></plain_text>
