<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociological Analysis 1976, 37, 3:265-271 Voegelin on the Modern Intellectual and Political Crises Stephen A. McKnight University of Florida Eric Voegelin has recently published two books of major importance: The Ecumenic Age (1974) and From Enlightenment to Revolution (1975). These works make signal contributions to their respective fields of study, and also illuminate the changes in Voegelin's theoretical perspective over the last thirty years. I have already discussed The Ecumenic Age in this journal. Part of Voegelin's extended study Order and History, that volume explains the causes of the sixteen year interruption of the program of publica- tion and comments at length on the present state of his enterprise. I now propose to examine From Enlightenment to Revolution, a work in many ways as crucial to the under- standing of Voegelin's theoretical development as The Ecumenic Age. Much of its significances lies in the fact that it offers Voegelin's first extended analysis of our own epoch. This is a bit ironic since Voegelin's initial and abiding concern has been the diagnosis of the conditions which led to the rise of modern political ideologies and the collapse of political and social science. In fact, Voegelin's call for a new science of politics and his analysis of the history of order and disorder grow out of his endeavor to penetrate the fundamental dimensions of the modern predicament. The book also has the merit of providing a connecting link between the earliest formulation and the present state of Voegelin's project. Though published in 1975, and therefore his most recent publication, From Enlightenment to Revolution was actually pre- pared in the 1940's before The New Science of Politics or Order and History. Originally, it was part of a three thousand page history of political ideas from Plato to the present.' Though the manuscript was complete Voegelin withheld it from publication when he became convinced that the primary problems of interest to him must be explored from a new perspective. This new perspective is set forth in The New Science of Politics and Order and History. Because From Enlightenment to Revolution is so valuable for an understanding of the development of Voegelin's theory, much of my effort will center on this topic. What, for example, can be learned about his early analysis of political ideas and why he abandons that approach? How does the program of Order and History differ from his history of political ideas? How valid or useful are the findings of From Enlightenment to Revolution if Voegelin himself found the results unsatisfactory? Before we can give due consideration to these intriguing questions, we must review the contents of the volume to ascertain its subject area, thesis, and method of investigation. II As the title indicates the book focuses on political ideas which emerge in the Enlightenment and run through the revolutionary movements of the 19th and 20th 'William C. Havard provides the background to the development of this manuscript in "Voegelin's Diagnosis of the Western Crises" in a forthcoming issue of the Denver Quarterly. 265</page><page sequence="2">266 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS centuries. Voegelin begins his analysis of the modern epoch with the Enlightenment because it is here that an "acute consciousness that in the aggregate an epoch has come to an end and a gigantic effort of interpretation is required in order to recover for the existence of man in society and history a meaning which could substitute for the lost meaning of Christian existence" (5). The philosophes proudly proclaim the end of the age of dogmatism and superstition and announce the advent of the Age of Reason, Science, and Enlightenment. Voegelin's analysis however demonstrates that this period is dominated not by Reason and Science but dogma and Gnosticism. The claim to have moved beyond dubious theological and metaphysical speculation is indefensible. While the exhausted dogma of Christianity is obviously cast off, the existential questions to which it speaks are not. As the Christian structures of meaning disintegrate, secular substitutes are sought. What is especially striking is that these substitutes are more often than not derived directly from Christian patterns and symbols. This process can be seen quite clearly in Voltaire's philosophy of history, which he proposes as a replacement for the medieval theology of history. While the Church and Empire were strong and vital, the West was held to be the spiritual and political center of the world. The idea of a universal brotherhood of man- kind was reflected in the symbol of the corpus mysticum Christi, the mystical body of Christ, and in the conception of world history as the eschatological advance from the Creation and Fall to the Advent and Crucifixion and the Parousia and Last Judgment. But the myth of medieval universality is reduced to a provincial, relative position under the combined effect of the expansion of the boundaries of the known world, the break- down of the Empire into sovereign nation states, and the metaphysical consequences of the scientific revolution. Voltaire's Essai sur les moeurs attempts in part to overcome the myopia of the Christian construction by encyclopedic completeness. To Bousset's famous account of salvation history in Discours sur l'histoire universelle (1681), Voltaire adds studies on China, India, Persia, and Islam. But, as Voegelin explains, the attempt at encyclopedic completeness is only one dimension of the new universal history. The ideal of completeness is, indeed, no more than an incidental factor in the Essai sur les moeurs. Voltaire embarks on a reconstruction of historical meaning and the pattern resulting from his efforts has become the standard of secularist reconstruction for more than a century (9). The object of the Essai, as Voltaire indicates, is "the history of the human spirit and not the detailed facts which are usually distorted anyway . .. We rather have to see by what steps we have advanced from barbarian rusticity of [the Middle Ages] to the politeness of ours." The purpose then is not the cataloguing of societies but rather the presentation of "the extinction, the renaissance and progress of the human spirit." While this view clearly dispenses with the biblical salvation story it nevertheless posits an intelligible pro- cess of unfolding meaning in history. History is charted as secular progress in the evolu- tion of human sensibilities and social enlightenment. One discovers in place of the corpus mysticum Christi the analogical corpus mysticum humanitatis. Moreover Voltaire's three- phase line of progress is clearly derived from the sacred history. In fact, Voltaire's appropriation of this Christian eschatological model becomes the prototype for the interpretation of history for the next hundred and fifty years.2 2"The categories of meaning are again Christian analogues. Voltaire speaks of extinction, renais- sance and progress of the human spirit. The extinction corresponds to the Fall, the renaissance to the Redemption, the progress to a Third Realm of spiritual perfection.

For the lost symbol of a universal humanity under the Fatherhood of God, Turgot creates the sym- bol of the masse totale and points to a line of meaning running through human social history. This meaning is constituted by the softening of mores, the enlightenment of the mind, and an increase in global commerce. The problems associated with this symbolism were well known to Turgot. First, it must be admitted that not all men or all societies participate equally in the collective advance of the masse totale. In fact, by Turgot's criteria only a very small portion of humanity has actually been involved in or benefited from such progress. The crucial question then must be raised: Of what concern can it be to a man, who lives and dies in his finite present, whether mankind has progressed in the past or will progress in the future, if he himself leads a miserable life in an unenlightened, isolated community where the mores are restrictive? Turgot's answer is the masse totale. The triumphant brutality of the answer is unsurpassable. History has no meaning for man. What does it matter? It has meaning for the masse totale (93). An abstract symbol, having no concrete existence, replaces the individual and humanity as the actor in history. The Age of Reason and Humanity liberates the masse totale at the expense of man and mankind. It is incredible, but none the less true, that Turgot's untenable concept of a masse totale becomes a dominant political symbol in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. And when it combines with nationalism and other militant ideologies, it produces murderous consequences. What might be the innocuous pastime of an exultant intellectual becomes a political force be- cause it gains, on the international scene, the momentum of a powerful state if it can capture the nation to the degree that the national mass identifies itself with the leadership of mankind. In its outline we see the idea of a mankind dominated by a chosen people which embodies the progressive essense of humanity. In historical actuality that would mean a totalitarian organiza- tion of mankind in which the dominating power would beat down in the name of mankind and freedom everybody who does not conform to its standards (99). The associations with Communism, National Socialism, and American imperialism are all too apparent. A symbol such as the masse totale can remain viable only by deliberate and dogmatic misconstruction of history to legitimate a political faction claiming to represent human- ity. The Whiggist misconstruction of English constitutional history is a match for the nationalist misconstructions of German history. The nonsense written about the medieval emperors who betrayed the German national interest through their hankering after Rome is the counterpart to the nonsense written about the Magna Carta. And the nationalist and progressivist mis- constructions are even surpassed by the nightmare of Marxist and National Socialist historical writing. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, this writing of selective history with a view to support a contemporary political interest was even theorized through a logic of his- toriography chiefly through the efforts of German methodologists. In this movement, the writ- the system are the Middle Ages (extinction), the era of beginning toleration since Henry IV (renais- sance) and Voltaire's own age (progress). The categorization is not analogous to the Augustinian with its saeculum senescens but rather to the trinitarian of Joachem of Flora.... While the construc- tion is not thoroughly elaborated, it clearly foreshadows the later construction of Saint-Simon and Comte with its "law" of the three phases: the religious, the metaphysical and the positive-scientific. Since the content which enters the categories is an independent variable, it foreshadows, further- more, the possibility that new materials may enter the categorical pattern, as has actually happened in the Marxist and National Socialist Constructions" (11).</page><page sequence="4">268 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS ing of history was considered to be a selection of materials in orientation towards a "value" (Wertauswahl) and correspondingly it was the function of the historian to impose meaning on history (Sinngebung). The immanent logic of this attitude could hardly lead to any other con- clusion than the postulate that history has to be rewritten in every generation to suit the new political developments (101). The movement which originates as a reconstruction of history results in the dogmatic destruction of history as a science. The shaking of the foundations of the Christian myth led also to the search for a new theory of man and society. And, as with history, the re-theorization draws heavily upon Christian imagery. The complicated inversions and deformations that occur in these genealogies cannot be presented here (pp. 35-73). We can only comment on their implications for political theory. The common trait of the various genealogies of morality and ethics, e.g. materialism, subjectivism, and hedonism, was the abolition of the notion of innate moral ideas, the destruction of the psyche, and the reduction of man's life to a somatic, utilitarian basis. Helvetius boldly states the implications when he concludes that "under a good legislator, only the fools would be vicious" and then asks, "What does it matter whether men are born virtuous, if only they can be born with a passion which makes them virtuous, if skillfully managed" (48). Man bereft of noetic consciousness becomes nothing more than a completely malle- able, morally neutral instrument open to the legislator's programming. Man is no longer an entity that has its existential center within itself; he has become a mechanism of pleasure, pain and passions which can be harnessed by another man, the "legisla- tor," for purposes of his own. Instrumentalization proved to be a peculiarly rich complex of sentiments and ideas. First of all, the ground of existence in the Pascalian sense is denied to man. Here we are at the key point of the anti-Christian attack on the existence of man. Only when the spiritual center of man, through which man is open to the transcendent realissimum, is destroyed can the disorderly aggregate of passions be used as an instrument by the legislator. The Kantian, rational-Christian, ethical rule that every man must be considered an end in him- self and not an instrument for ulterior purposes, is perverted into its opposite through the thesis: man is no end in himself but merely an instrument to be used by the legislator. This is the new basic thesis for collectivism in all its variants down to the contemporary forms of to- talitarianism (70). The destruction of the human psyche, then, is accompanied by the rise of messianic legislators who would save mankind by shaping the future course of political history. If the intellectual is able to create in himself the model combination of reason and virtue, . . . if he can create a new mankind in his image through propaganda and brutality and if he can direct the calculable course of mankind indefinitely on the path determined by his model qualities-why should his directive efforts not result in the creation of a substantially new man as the bearer of the perfect society (133f.). Where God and Christ failed, the new messiah is confident of success. And if anything characterizes modern political history, it is the procession of these megalomaniacal fig- ures from Comte and Marx to Lenin and Hitler. The two secular messiahs to receive extended treatment are Auguste Comte, the father of sociology and the founder of the Religion of Humanity, and Karl Marx, the creator of the economic critique of history and the founder of communism. Voegelin's command of primary and secondary sources and his penetration of key theoretical is- sues make these the best brief expositions available anywhere. The section on Comte challenges the orthodox division of his writings into an accep- table early scientific period and a later problematic religious period. Voegelin's careful</page><page sequence="5">VOEGELIN ON THE MODERN INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL CRISIS 269 analysis shows that Comte's messianic vision which later positivists want to relegate to his religious period is, in fact, present from the beginning. His analysis also reveals Comte's repeated proclamation of his own messianic role in human history. Then, in one of the most intriguing parts of his analysis, Voegelin examines Comte's curious method of intellectual "purification," a process which entails the avoidance of any other writings on similar issues and the deliberate avoidance of theoretical and existential questions which might undermine his magical operations on the stubborn facts of existence. Similar issues are dealt with in the sections on Marx. There is the problem of an "early" and "late" Marx. This time the troublesome material is from the early "philosophical" period. Again Voegelin demonstrates that the dream of transforming not just economic conditions but human existence is present in both the early and later works. Of special importance is the section on Marx's inverted dialectics which Voegelin proves to be not an inversion of Hegel but a rejection of philosophical inquiry. And like Comte, Marx dispenses with troublesome metaphysical questions and existential experi- ences by imposing a ban on philosophical questions. But Voegelin's analysis of Comte and Marx does not stop here. He poses the question: Were Comte and Marx aware of their intellectual chicanery? Voegelin's answer is yes, and the explanation offered is that these two social scientists were intellectually and spiritually diseased. The egomania behind their Gnostic dream of transforming reality and providing saving knowledge was stronger than their search for truth. This is, of course, an extremely controversial position, even given the critical work of Dumas and Lubac on Comte and Lo with and Tucker on Marx. Nevertheless Voegelin's interpretation is a model of meticulous analysis of primary texts and will not be easily refuted. Positivists and Marxists who want to attack Voegelin's view must offer an equally competent analysis. A dogmatic doctrinaire defense confirms rather than repudiates Voegelin's claims. III Given the significance of the results, one is puzzled as to why Voegelin found his history of political ideas inadequate. Compared to standard approaches it certainly marks a bold new departure. While conventional histories conduct comparative studies of ideas in the great works of the political theorists or trace the course of major political events in actual history, Voegelin critically examines the theoretical constructs and sym- bols which appear in both theory and practice. Moreover, his probing of origins and his scrupulous analysis of texts show that root constructs in modern political theory and in recent revolutionary creeds are not as theoretically-sound or empirically-based as they pretend. The power of "Reason" and "Science" has been envoked to authenticate un- tenable distortions and misconstructions of human culture and human history. This approach certainly sets Voegelin's enterprise apart from the treatments which trace the steady progress of political science from its primitive beginnings with the Greeks to its modern scientific culmination or plot the steady march toward democratic principles in political reality. Why then is this work laid aside? Voegelin (1966:78) has explained that the shift was due in part to the enormous increase in data. His history of ideas began in conventional fashion with the Greeks. However, as the data became available on non-Western societies and especially on the Ancient Near East, Voegelin became convinced that an adequate history of political ideas would have to take these into account. But the new material also posed new prob- lems. One does not find in Egypt and Mesopotamia systematic political speculation like that of the Greeks; political order is expressed in myth and cosmological symbol. Politi- cal ideas then cannot constitute the field of study since political history extends beyond the advent of political theory. It should be noted, however, that this abandonment of a</page><page sequence="6">270 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS history of ideas for a history of political order and disorder in concrete societies does not mark a significant departure in methodology. As we have noted, Voegelin has never treated ideas.in vacuo but examines the pragmatic events and the intellectual ferment that give rise to new conceptions of political reality. In fact, one of the special features of From Enlightenment to Revolution is the demonstration of a direct connection between the intellectual revolution of the eighteenth and the political revolutions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Therefore, the approach in the history of political ideas and in The New Science of Politics and Order and History are in many ways quite similar. But there are also important differences. One of the most significant is the shift from problems in political theory to problems in the philosophy of history. The need for a philosophy of history, however, is clearly stated in From Enlightenment to Revolution. In a section which examines the Enlightenment doctrine of the progress of the mind, Voege- lin observes that Turgot and Comte are correct in noting a development or progress from the anthropomorphic to the scientific analysis of nature. With regard to the understanding of the phenomenal world this clearly is an advance. But the Enlighten- ment thinker portrays it as an advance in consciousness from the foggy marshes of myth onto the clear solid footing of science. As a result reality is truncated; the universe or cosmos is reduced to phenomena and the knowledge of substance is lost. The evolution described by Turgot and Comte is not an evolution of the human intellect in general at all, but rather the evolution of a very specific problem that is well known to us, that is, the problem of phenomenalism. The transition from the anthropomorphic to the positive phase does not mark a progress in our understanding of the external world; it is the transition from speculation on substance to the science of phenomena. In the anthropomorphic phase the knowledge of phenomena is still embedded in the knowledge of substances; in the positive phase the knowledge of phenomena is differentiated into the critical system of mathematized science. This development in itself certainly is an advance of our knowledge of phenomena, but it is not a progress of the human intellect. On the contrary, insofar as the knowledge of the universe is now restricted to the knowledge of phenomena, the knowledge of substance is lost. As far as the development of the integral functions of the intellect and spirit is concerned, the transition is distinctly a retrogression. This was the problem of Giordano Bruno. . ., it was the issue in the debate between Kepler and Fludd, and in the Kantian distinction between noumena and phenomena; it is the problem to which Schelling gave the solution of the Potenzenlehre and the philosophy of the unconscious (115). In his Philosophie der Mythologie und der Offenbarung Schelling attempted to correct this distortion and truncation of experience. Ancient myth is not dismissed as an infantile creation to be overcome by subsequent maturity of the mind's powers of ratiocination. Myth is a valid expression of the experience of cosmic order which can be superseded (but not invalidated) by subsequent differentiations of experience and symbolization. Schelling draws into the orbit of his interpretation a vast historical material, including the pagan myth, Oriental symbolisms, and the Catholic and Protestant Churches, and the further enlargement of this orbit, particularly through the inclusion of primitive symbols and of the Oriental civilizations is the principal problem for a philosophy of history of the spirit after Schelling (1 16, italics mine). In shifting from a history of political ideas to a philosophy of history of the spirit, Voegelin is not abandoning any of his concerns with political order and disorder. Rather he is placing it in the broader context of an analysis of the history of human consciousness. Or to state it a bit differently, Voegelin becomes convinced that modern political disorder has its origins in spiritual disorder. The task then is to examine all the available data from all known societies in an effort to determine the nature of man's experience of existence. And as already stated the basic concern is with the speculation on substance and the ground (arche ) of existence.</page><page sequence="7">VOEGELIN ON THE MODERN INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL CRISIS 271 What happens to ontological speculation after the differentiation of cosmological myth? What is the relation of philosophy and theology to myth? As the differentiation of man's primary experience of the cosmos occurs what basic dimensions of consciousness persist in the new symbolic forms and what is superseded by the new experiences? When this anamnetic recovery of primary experience is begun the modern western consciousness stands as a pathetic deformation and destruction of human experience and of onto- logical reality. Moreover, modern political ideologies, while claiming to release man from his alienated state, in fact, can function only by the destruction of vital elements of experience. We can now see more clearly the connection between Voegelin's analysis of the mod- ern epoch and his studies of early civilizations. Order and History is more than an historian's accurate record of the past, it is a philosopher's penetration of man's articula- tion of his humanity. Conceived this way, the analysis of early orders is a vital part of the critical analysis of our own epoch which has deliberately attempted to falsify and deform the history of consciousness. Voegelin eloquently states the connection between his con- cern to penetrate the foundations of the modern crises and the program of Order and History in The Ecumenic Age. In our time, the inherited symbols of ecumenic humanity are disintegrating, because the deforming doctrinalization has become socially stronger than the experiential insights it was originally meant to protect. The return from symbols which have lost their meaning to the experiences which constitute meaning is so generally recognizable as the problem of the present that specific references are unnecessary. The great obstacle to this return is the massive block of accumulated symbols, secondary and tertiary, which eclipses the reality of man's existence. To raise this obstacle and its structure to consciousness, and by its removal to help in the return to the truth of reality as it reveals itself in history, has become the purpose of Order and History (IV, 58).
