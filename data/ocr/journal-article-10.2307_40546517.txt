<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Hannah Arendt Politics: As It Is, Was, Might Be BY GEORGE MC KENNA "Our citizens attend both to public and private duties, and do not allow absorption in their own various affairs to interfere with their knowledge of the city's. We differ from other states in regarding the man who holds aloof from public life not as cquiet' but as useless. ..." -Pericles, Funeral Oration. When Helen and Robert Lynd visited Muncie, Indiana - "Middle- town" - in 1925 they were told by one of its citizens that "no good man will go into politics here. Why should he? Politics is dirty."1 Ten years later when they returned they were greeted with this observation from another Middletown resident: "Whatever changes you may find elsewhere in Middletown, you will find that our poli- tics and government are the same crooked shell game."2 Great changes have swept Middletown since 1937: urbanization, industrialization and enough education and sophistication to escape the parochialism once attached to being a "Hoosier." But what remains constant, defying all these social changes, is Middlctown's fundamentally negative attitude toward politics. A recent survey by The New York Times sampled the reading habits of contemporary Middletonians.8 Certainly they read more than they did in the 1920's and 1930's; the libraries are well used now, and new bookstores have opened to a flourishing business.4 But what do they read? High on the list of best sellers in 1966 were Peyton Place, Valley of the Dolls and Dr. Spock's baby book - but nothing even remotely touching on the political life or the political involvements of this nation. Not a single book on Vietnam could be found on the bookstore racks. 1 Middlrtown (New York: Harcourt.

The cliches of Americans and the connotations they instinctively place upon words are unerring indi- cators of their feelings about politics: to "play politics" Is to subor- dinate the public good to partisan advantage, a "politician" is a cynical, usually corrupt, manipulator, and a "political animal1' is a ruthless, arrogant species ready to go any length to get into office. All too often, of course, this is the case, but only because our citizenry have abandoned politics to precisely that group of professionals who can hardly be expected to make of it anything more than a way of earning a living or assuaging their vanities. Thus the opprobrium which quite properly attaches to so many of its practitioners is car- ried back to the concept of politics, and the bias is reinforced." What is needed is some way of breaking this circle, of impressing upon Americans the simple truth that politics - especially today, when its outcome can be so immediate and devastating - is too important to be left to the politicians. Our nation's political scientists, on the whole, have done exactly the opposite. Instead of goading us with a model of politics as it might be, they have formulated a vast and sometimes arcane rational- ization for politics as it is. Sometimes they adopt an attitude of stoic resignation: in 1960 Richard E. Neustadt snw no alternative to "emer- gencies in policy with politics as usual'* in America; what we need, then, is a strong President who will hold the country together in the course of seeking his own personal power.7 Sometimes they cele- s ïbid.9 p. 24.

But it must be remembered that they are composed of a small minority who arc regarded with bewilderment, sometimes with horror, by the overwhelming bulk of their fellow citizens who uish only for a return to normalcy. What is nrnre to the point of this essay, there is at this time virtually no support or evrin understanding of what they are doing from the social science community. Like the teachers of astronomy who would not look through Galileo's telescope, our teachers of political science in the nation's universities continue to talk to one another nidrd by graphs and charts and then write books on "the governmental process" without really noticing what is going on under their windows. The great danger is that, without being incor- porated into η secure intellectual tradition, our contemporary movements may degenerate into mindless fanaticism or trail off into some kind of "campy" merri- ment. If so, they will be consigned to infamy or oblivion without evrr having been understood.</page><page sequence="3">106 GEORGE MC KENN A brate: at the end of the 1950's, Daniel Bell and Seymour Martin Lipset proclaimed "the end of ideology" in the West for the simple reason, in Lipset's words, "that the fundamental political problems of the industrial revolution have been solved." β Nothing remains, then, but to bring our blessings to the less fortunate countries of the world and "accept the fact that serious ideological controversies have ended at home." ' The end of ideology thus emerges as an ideology of acceptance. This is the sociologists' counterpart to "plural- ism," the ideology par excellence of political science professors since the early 1950V The emergence of pluralism as a school of analysis was an intellectual expression of the end of the New and Fair Deals, the consequent decline of political competition and the re-cmcrgence of bi-partisan "consensus" politics. But the pluralism as an analysis became pluralism as a doctrine when those who expended so much to explain how a politics of general stagnation "works" acquired a vested interest in showing that it does work. Hence, a whole philosophy of man and his capabilities, a trifle cynical perhaps, but in keeping with the tough-minded, debunking posture of those who take pride in being, not mere political thinkers but political scientists: It would clear the air of a good deal of cant if instead of assuming that politics is a normal and natural concern of human beings, one were to make the contrary assumption that whatever lip service citizens may pay to conventional attitudes, politics is a remote, alien, and unrewarding activity.10 More is involved here than a questionable empirical statement; it is clear that Robert Dahl believes the citizenry at large should stay out of politics. When the people at large get involved, "emotion rises and reasoned discussion declines."11 What political science text- book does not cite some study or another suggesting that a little apathy is a good thing and a high voter turnout is a sure sign of "extrem- ism"? The chief characteristic of the pluralistic school is this patroniz- 7 Richard E. Neustadt, Presidential Power (Science Editions: New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1962.)

Government becomes a matter for professional brokers who mediate among pressure groups. The rest of the citizenry are dissolved into an abstraction called "the common man," lf a separate species of animal from Yale professors, who Is to be studied, probed and above all apologized for. If he is apathetic, then apathy is the price we pay for democracy.19 If he is primarily absorbed with accumulation - getting things - rather than in poli- tical participation, then the social scientists will obligingly construct their models of politics upon the question of "who gets what, when, how.'* For "in liberal societies, politics is a sideshow in the great circus of life." 14 This is the way we do things here, mister. It is against this background of apology for mass apathy and oligarchic control that the political thought of Hannah Arendt stands in sharp relief. In a land where politics is a sideshow and flying saucers are serious business, something more is needed than bland description of how the system works: what is needed is a political discipline which asks, broadly, about the ends toward which the system works, which undertakes a critical analysis of those ends, and, if they are wanting, which provides alternatives that are viable and attainable, or at least worth striving for. Arendfs political thought, taken as a whole, is an important step toward such a recon- struction. Her unique contribution is an attempt to recapture the meaning of political action as it was undcrstod by the actual partici- pants in great political enterprises, and, using them as a guide, to measure the areas where politics has declined or altogether collapsed in today's world. What emerges is a radical critique of all those aspects of the modern world which either result from or contribute to the political environment in which most of us live. It is radical in the sense that it attempts to go to the roots of the problem by tracing it to its historical origins; it is a critique because it makes no attempt to treat phenomena such as totalitarianism in a "value free" manner: Arendt is convinced that to describe, say, concentration camps sine ha, "is not to be 'objective,' but to condone them."" 12 Sec, for example, Robert E.

A later chapter of the book I am writing outlines more fully Arendt's attempt to meet this challenge, but it is necessary, even at this stage, to see what Arendt means by political action if we are to understand what she has to say about its decline. In this essay, then, we shall be concerned only with Arendt's definition of politics, a definition which will serve as a normative standard throughout the book. However, normative or not, a definition cannot simply be concocted out of fancy. Arendt, herself, contends that, outside the purely formal disciplines such as mathematics, we are not at liberty to define terms as we wish, that the price paid for such a form of "liberalism" is the destruction of intelligible communication.111 From what experiences, then, does she derive her definition of politics? First and foremost, the source is ancient Greece, when man was defined as a zoom politikon, "an animal who lives in a polis" What kind of animal, then, used to live in a polis, and what is a polis? To answer this, she turns, not to the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans (which was, after all, born during the decay of their politi- cal life), but to their experiences, many of which may have been forgotten or misunderstood in the tradition of political philosophy. Hannah Arendt, then, is not another "neo-classical" philosopher. She is not, like Leo Strauss,17 criticising modern thought for its loss of Aristotelian rigor, nor, like Eric Vocgclin,1" asserting that Platonism provides a key to understanding our present perplexities. Quite the contrary. Arendt contends that Plato and Aristole actually misunder- stood the real nature of politics, got it mixed up with other activities not really political and passed this very fundamental misunderstand- ing down to subsequent generations of philosophers and into the Western tradition of political philosophy. This does not prevent her from citing them with approval when they have, as she sees it, accurately recorded Greek experiences undistortcd by the apolitical cast of their thought. But more important than Greek philosophy as texts for Greek political experience are the works of Herodotus, Homer, Thucydides and the dramatists, and Arendt makes free use of them. Nor, in trying to recapture the essential meaning of the polis and in its dwellers, is her debt exclusively to the Greeks.

It can be found at times in the Romans, among the revolutionists of the past two centuries, in the resistance fighters of World War II and the Israeli Kibbutz. All of these political experiences are the mortar from which Arendt construe« a definition of politics as it might be. The best way to begin studying her definition of politics is to note this observation which she makes of it in The Human Condition: Action [i.e., political action], the only activity that goes on directly between men without the intermediary of things or matter, corresponds to the human condition of plurality, to the fact that men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world.1* In other words, politics has three characteristics: First, it does not require the intermediary of things or matter but goes on directly between man and man. Second, because of this fact, it cannot be performed in solitude and always requires the presence of others. Third, and following from the first and second, it corresponds to the plurality of men. Her meaning here ought to be explained. What sets men apart from animals, in Arendt's thoroughly secular philosophy, is not the presence of an immortal soul or even a rational faculty, but the fact that men are mortals whereas animals have, in a sense, an eternal life.50 This seems to be the exact opposite of the Christian understanding. What she means is that animals have eternal life because they arc properly viewed, not as individuals, but as parts of their encompassing species; and the species "dog," for example, will go on living indefinitely, whatever may befall indi- vidual dogs. Of course, the same is also true in the case of the species "mankind." But the difference, for Arendt, is that man admits of more than en masse classification. Man, properly understood, is really individual men: each member possesses his own life, a "Mos, with a recognizable life-story from birth to death,'*21 rising out of the eternal cycle of biological life or zoe. In short, "men are 'the mortals,' the only mortal things there are, for animals exist only as members of their species and not as individuals." 2* Anyone who has owned pets might object to this line of reasoning. Her elaboration of it makes it more defensible while bringing it closer to the Christian understanding. Very simply, what she has in mind is the unique- lf The Human Condition, p. 9. f ° Between Past and Future, p. 42. " Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">110 GEORGE MC KEN NA ness of the human person. All things, including even inanimate objects, possess the quality of attentas, "otherness.'*" But only indi- vidual men are able, actively, to express their distinctive qualities and not merely, passively, to be considered distinct. Each man, in other words, is able to "communicate himself," to reveal himself as a "who" rather than a "what."84 Political action corresponds to this human plurality - the fact that men, not Man, live in this world - because it is the means by which men are able to communicate their distinctness without recourse to anything other than themselves. Painters and poets also com- municate themselves, but they must perform their works in solitude and require the intermediary of things - if only pen and ink - to express themselves. Political action is the most completely human of activities. Politics, as Arendt understands it, is indissolubly bound up with speech. A whine or growl might communicate anger or hunger, the use of mathematical symbols might communicate certain concepts, a computer can analyze and communicate data with superhuman accuracy, but only human speech can communicate man's distinct- ness as a person, can reveal him as a "who" and not simply a "what." "Action and speech are so closely related because the primordial and specifically human act must at the same time contain the answer to the question asked of every newcomer: 'Who are you?'3* Aristotle, she believes, "only formulated the current opinion of the polis about man and the political way of life"56 when he defined him as both a "political animal" (zoon politikon) and a "live creature capable of speech" (zoon logon ekhon), for both these activities were integrally connected in the life of the polis. It is no accident to Arendt that the Greeks, who loved nothing so much as a good argument, were the most political of peoples. In contrast, a glance at the Congressional Record should be sufficient to disclose something of the attitude which professional politicians today have toward focused debate. At any rate, she is convinced that without the accompaniment of speech action would be meaningless and subjcctlcss. Without the accompaniment of speech . . . action would not only lose its revelatory character but, and by the same token, it would lose its subject, as it were; not acting men but performing *8 The Human Condition, p. 156. 11 Ibid. -3 The Human Condition, p. 158. 2e Ibid., p. 26.</page><page sequence="8">On Hannah Arendt 1 1 1 robots would achieve what, humanly speaking, would remain incomprehensible. Speechless action would no longer be action because there would no longer be an actor, and the actor, the doer of deeds is possible only if he is at the same time the speaker of words. The action he begins is humanly disclosed by the word, and though his deed can be perceived in its brute physical appear- ance without verbal accompaniment, it becomes relevant only through the spoken word in which he identifies himself as the actor announcing what he does, has done, and intends to do.57 For Arendt, "speechless action" is a contradiction in terms, for action without speech is no longer politics but violence. Recause of the contemporary confusion between political power and violence, this point is particularly relevant today, and I will return to it presently. "The raison d'etre of politics is freedom. . . ."''" Although Arendt claims to be stating but a truism, ;* it would be disputed by a number of prcmodern and modern political thinkers from Hobbcs to Rein- hold Niebuhr. The latter has made these observations: It is our common assumption that political freedom is a simple summom honum. It is not. Freedom must always be related to community and justice. Every community seeks consciously and unconsciously to make social peace and order the first goal of its life. It may pay a very high price in the restriction of freedom so as to establish order; but order 's the first desideratum for the simple reason that chaos means non-existence/0 Yes, Arendt might reply, it is quite true that communities - except during times of revolution - seldom make freedom the first order of business. But this anthropological fact does not negate the prin- ciple of the primacy of freedom. (All communities also have some form of ritualized cruelty, but this is hardly a justification for it.) Political life might well be impossible without order, but it would be, she believes, meaningless without freedom/1 Niebuhr's observa- tion, moreover, assumes an antithesis between freedom and order which Arendt would not accept. Freedom, Arendt believes, produces its own order, an order not imposed from without but growing out " ibid.. pp. 15R-59. ^"Freedom and Politics: Λ Lecture/1 Chicago Review, XIV (Spring, 1060), 28. ■" Ibid., p.

In Niebuhr's frame of reference, Arendt would almost certainly be classified among the "foolish children of light," for she goes the length of identifying politics with freedom. "Men are free, as distinguished from possessing the gift for freedom, as long as they act, neither before nor after, for to be free and act are the same/'" Arendt acknowledges a debt to Martin Heidegger and other existertz philosophers/3 and her own writings emphasize the concrete and the existential. She would not be put in the position of saying that man is "essentially" free for the same reason that she will not discuss an absolute, unchanging "human nature"; fixed essences have no place in her thinking about man and his activities.84 Man, she believes, is as he acts and "the appearance of freedom, like the manifestations of principles coincides with the performing act."85 She is interested in freedom as a phenomenon, a "demonstrable fact"'* rather than a metaphysical category. She compares the appearance of freedom to the actions of the performing artist: it exists only m the moment of performance It is, therefore, unrealizable in an envir- onment from which politics is excluded - in tribal societies, in the privacy of the household, or in "despotically ruled communities which banish their subjects into the narrowness of the home and thus pre- vent the rise of a public realm."37 When she says that freedom needs "Ibid., p. 33. __...._._.- "See her article, "What is Existenz Philosophy," Partisan Review, ΛΠ1 (Win- ter, 1946), 34-56. In this article she praised the philosophy of another existenz philosopher, Karl Jaspers, while rejecting that of Heidegger. In a recent interview, however, she looked back on her 1946 essay as one affected by her personal dislike for Heidegger because of his Nazi leanings. In retrospect, she admitted, she had been strongly affected by Heidegger, especially for his addition of the historical dimension to the phenomenology of Husserl, i. e., Heidegger's insight that before you can say what a things is, you must say what it wan. This historical approach is obvious in her treatment of totalitarianism. As she explains: "What I did - and what I might have done anvway because of my previous training and the way of my thinking - was to discover the chief elements of totalitarianism and to analyze them in historical terms, tracing these elements back in history as far as I deemed proper and necessary. That is, I did not write a history of totalitarianism but an analysis in terms of history [emphasis added/ . . . .

It is highly unlikely that we, who can know, determine, and define the natural essences of all things surrounding us, which we are not, should ever be able to do the same for ourselves - this would be like jumping over our own shadows. Moreover, nothing entitles us to assume that man has a nature or essence in the same sense as other things. The Human Condition, p. 12.

Politics, as she understands it, does not depend upon any par- ticular physical location. When she says that it requires a "public space" or "space of appearances," she uses these expressions in a figurative or social, rather than a literal, physical sense. The ancient polis, for example, was not the city-state as a geographical entity, but an organization of people that was, ultimately, independent of material factors; hence, the watchword, "Wherever you go, you will be a polis." The space of appearances is therefore to be interpreted in the widest sense of the word as "the space where I appear to others as others appear to me, where men exist not merely like other living or inanimate things but make their appearance explicitly." It is a space that "comes into being wherever men are together in the man- ner of speech and action," hence speech and action provide their own public realm and are not dependent upon buildings or even constitutions.'" Arendt is simply taking note of the fact that one need not go to Washington or City Hall to take part in politics and that the real centers of political action may be far removed from the formal centers, from the "paraphernalia of officialdom." a* A letter to an individual or newspaper can be a supremely political act. The Federalist papers and the letters of Thomas Jefferson (who spent the better part of his life at his writing desk in Monticello) are examples of how independent of location the "space of appearances" may be. Political action, in Arendt's analysis, can appear in unlikely places because it goes on directly between man and man, without the inter- mediary of things. Wherever men gather it is found potentially; but, she emphasizes, only potentially. The rise and fall of civiliza- tions is to be explained, not by material things or their absence, but the actualization and loss of power. Power, elusive and intangible as it is, plays a key role in Arendt's notion of politics. What first undermines and then kills political communities is loss of power and final impotence; and power cannot be stored up and kept in reserve for emergencies, like the instruments of violence, but exists only in its actualization. Where power is not actualized, it passes away, and history is full of examples that ** The Human Condition, p. 1O.~. " Between Pa*t and Future, p. 3.</page><page sequence="11">114 GEORGE MC KEN NA the greatest material riches cannot compensate for this loss.40 Power, as its etymological roots reveal, always has a potential char- acter. In order for it to be actualized, it is not sufficient for men to be gathered together. They could be collected together like slaves, or inmates in a concentration camp or passengers on a bus. It is only actualized when men undertake joint action. And since action, as she understands it, always involves speech, her concept of power must be distinguished from another term frequently used as a syno- nym: violence. (One hears "black power" invoked by those who mean "black violence" and "power polities'" used when "politics through violence" is really meant.) The hallmark of power is speech combined with creative action. Power is actualized only where word and deed have not parted company, where words are not empty and deeds not brutal, where words are not used to veil intentions but to disclose reali- ties, and deeds are not used to violate and destroy but to estab- lish relations and create new realities.41 Violence by itself is capable only of producing "an array of impotent forces that spend themselves, often spectacularly and vehemently but in utter futility, leaving behind neither mpnuments nor stories, hardly enough memory to enter into history at all."13 Impotent while armed to the teeth: as examples Arendt could point to the last years of Rome, the Court of Louis XVI, the Romanoffs, the succession of petty tyrants in South Vietnam since 1954, our own Southern sheriffs of whom the freedom song prophesies: "All their dogs will lie there rottin'/All their lives will be forgotten." What she does use to illustrate a con- frontation between impotent violence and non-violent power is the example of the Danish refusal to cooperate with the Nazis during World War II in the matter of deporting the Jews. So determined were the Danes to protect the Jews and so concerted were their efforts that they succeeded, even converting some high-ranking Nazis to their side.4* "One is tempted to recommend the story as required reading in political science for all students who wish to learn some- thing about the enormous power potential inherent in non-violent action and in resistance to an opponent possessing vastly superior means of violence."14 This does not mean that Arendt is a pacifist.

But that is the point. Organized violence - warfare - may be necessary to protect the operation of the political process but it must not be confused with it. Arendt's approach to politics is thus sharply at variance with that school of realpolitik which proceeds on the maxim that "war is the continua- tion of politics by other means." The adoption of this principle might have the effect of limiting war (although this has hardly been demon- strated by the events of the last few years), but it also destroys the distinction between politics and violence by making politics the con- tinuation of war by other means. And, far from being simply the attitude of a Prussian military officer, the maxim of Clauswitz is really a concise summary of the whole modern world's confusion between politics and violence, persuasion and force, debate and mute savagery. The United States policy, pursued with utter futility for three years, of bombing another country to "persuade'1 its leaders to negotiate only serves to underscore the danger in these confusions. Politics, for Hannah Arendt, comprises both word and deed. When men fall silent and turn to their weapons, politics comes to an end: "for man, to the extent that he is a political being, is endowed with the power of speech." '8 By sharply distinguishing between power and violence, Arendt is also freeing power from all the negative connotations attributed to it by the classical liberals - that power corrupts, that the state is an instrument of oppression or at best a necessary evil, a badge of lost innocence and so on. On the contrary, power, in Arcndt's view is essential to the free- dom of man and the survival of the body politic. "Power is what keeps the public realm, the potential space of appearance between acting and speaking, men in existence."1 n Let us pause to consider the implications of Arcndt's notion of politics and its connection with freedom. What she is saying is that no man can be free unless he participates in the political life of his community. It is important to keep in mind that Arendt considers politics in terms of active participation, not simply passive acceptance. Hence, the expression "government by consent of the governed" is, for Arendt, misleading if it is meant to imply that the governed are 45 On Revolution, p. 9. 4e The Human Condition, p. 179.</page><page sequence="13">116 GEORGE MC KENNA thereby taking part in politics. Consent alone does not constitute political activitiy. Government by consent, whether that consent be expressed in terms of periodic elections, referenda, plebiscites or what- ever, is not government by the people but government by an elite which occasionally gets the approval of the people. Perhaps she would consider the act of voting itself as political (Arendt is not clear on this question), but when the voter returns to his private life for another year or two or (most usually) four, he is no more free than the subject of an oriental despot, though he may be treated more decently. This should hardly fail to provoke a number of questions. Is it not possible for activities other than political participation to be considered free? And what is freedom after all - does it not ulti- mately depend upon whether one thinks he is free, regardless of his political status? Is not free will and freedom from neurosis a much more fundamental measure of freedom than political freedom, which is, after all, only a matter of externals? To the first question her answer here would seem to be a some- what equivocal "no." She admits that there is such a thing as freedom from politics, understood at various periods of history as the freedom to spend one's time in philosophic or religious contemplation, the freedom to make money without state interference, the freedom to go to work or play without worrying about the burden of political participation. But it is clear from the context in which she discusses freedom from politics that she does not regard this negative freedom very highly.47 Such an understanding of freedom, which she considers either Platonic or Christian in origin, seems to her more an obstacle to the enjoyment of political freedom than anything that could be called a positive contribution. But what of the activities themselves? Cannot man find freedom in the pursuit of monetary gain, visions of Truth, the joy of labor, or simply diversion? She would deny that any of these activities are, properly speaking, free acts. Contemplation is not even, as she under- stands it, an activity but a motionless state of wonder. Contemplation is "an experience of the eternal/' a confrontation with Being, or perhaps The Being, which rules all of the universe with iron laws. Far from being an experience of freedom, it is a surrender to neces- sity: the philosopher can only gaze in helpless awe at a universe "where no beginning and no end exist and where all natural things "Chicago Review, XIV (Spring, 1960), 30-32, Cf., Ort Revolution, p. 284.</page><page sequence="14">On Hannah Arendt 117 swing in changeless, deathless repetition/"" As for labor, business and play, since they serve nature's life processes (they are meant to feed the demands of the body which requires both food and rest), they ar^ as much ruled by necessity as the "changeless, deathless** universe which surrounds and encloses all life. Hence, Arendt would probably agree that the prototype American, whose major preoccupa- tions are his job, his golf and his home workshop, and who takes no part in political life, is not a free man. This is not to say that he is not, in his own way, happy. The Negroes in the antebellum South may also have been happier than those trying to liberate thcmsclv« ■: today. All of this underscores the difficulty of defining freedom as a state of mind. If freedom ultimately depends upon whether a man thinks he is free, then the term ceases to have meaning, for even a slave can be led to think he h free. (Arendt considers it more than π coincidence that "free will1* originated with Epictetus, the slave- philosopher.) We are plunged into a sea of subjectivity with one man's feelings as valid as another's with no commonly identifiable landmarks. Thus, she is suspicious of ufrce will" for the same reason that she distrusts psychiatry: "the human heart, as we all know, is a very dark place and whatever goes on in its obscurity can hardly be called a demonstrable fact."1* Arcndfs concept of freedom is political freedom, which is not a phenomenon of the will - or heart, or psyche - but a "worldly, tangible reality."0 Let us summarize Arendt's definition of politics. Politics is that activity, involving both action and speech, by which men jointly participate in a common endeavor. To put it in terms of a familinr allegory, if six primitive men, never having moved a heavy log before, gathered together, discussed the problem and decided to lift it together, that - and not any formal contract or compact - would put nn end to the state of nature, for it would be a political pet. Politics is inde- pendent of location or any material thing. It requires no apparatus, machinery, buildings. Above all, it requires no weaponry, for it operates through persuasion rather than force or fear. Politics consists, not in the giving and obeying of orders, but in mutual action and common participation. Politics, ns she understands It, is concerned with the extraordinary; a political act is to that extent an extraordinary act.

Since she considers politics as the most human activity, it is neces- sary, even at the expense of some repetition, to reflect on the meaning of man's mortality. "This is mortality: to move along a rectilinear line in a universe where everything, if it moves at all, moves in a cyclical order/181 What she means is that, while every creature exclusively natural is bound to nature's cycle of eternal recurrence and is incap- able of beginning anything new, man alone is able to move forward in a straight line, i.e., to have a history. Arendt's cosmology is postmedieval but pre-Darwinian. The medi- evalists lived in a universe in which natural bodies and forces had appetities for certain things while abhorring others - a human universe .not always friendly but at least on speaking terms with man. The effect of Galilean science was to divest nature of these traits. Yet Darwin's discoveries opened up the possibility that the medieval view, purged of its naivete, could be restored on an even better footing. The opportunity was not lost on Pierre Teilhârd de Chardin, the Jesuit paleontologist whose posthumous writings have already been enormously influential not only upon scientific thought but on secular and religious attempts to find a place for man in what otherwise seems a hostile and alien universe. The starting point for Teilhard's cosmic humanism is Darwin's key discovery: that nature does not go round and round, it goes forward. Toward what? Toward Parousia, the consummation and end of the world, but not before man somehow raises himself, evolves, to a spiritual level. Teilhard, then, restores a teleological universe, not, however, a teleological universe of iron determinism but one shot through with human qualities. Even inorganic substances have something within them akin to free will or at least to human intelligence, and Teilhard makes use of the discoveries of Einstein, Max Planck, Werner Heisen- berg and others to suggest that matter, the very stuff of the universe, has a "within." Even protein molecules possess "deep down in themselves, some sort of rudimentary psyche."" Teilhard strips Darwinism of its Galilean-Newtonian residue of determinism and finds a new home for man in a universe which is both teleological and anthropomorphic. Arendt's view is directly opposite. From the standpoint of man, " Ibid., p. 42. _ " Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, The Phenomenon of Man, trans. Bernard Wall (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1959), p. 77.</page><page sequence="16">On Hannah Arendt 119 or more accurately men, living in the here and now, nature is not progress but circularity: the change of seasons, the cycle of birth, growth, reproduction, death, and so on and on again. Teilhard measures a time not our time: million-year units are for scientists and mystics to contemplate, but they are too vast for acting men. The progress of nature is a scientific hypothesis without political relevance; it has no meaning for this generation, or the next, or even a hundred succeeding ones. In the long run nature may move forward, but in the long run we are dead. As for Teilhard's attempt to find human qualities in nature, it must be remembered that the analogy cuts both ways. On the one hand Jt can be taken to mean that the universe is permeated with some form of intelligence which, like that of humans, strives toward a goal. On the other hand the analogy between man and nature could mean that man is becoming more like the rest of nature, that nature can be compared to man only because man is losing the very qualities which once set him apart. What for Teilhard is an ex- hilarating revelation concerning nature is for Arendt a depressing fact about modern man."* The present essay, however, does not deal with Arcndt's view of man's plight but with her model of his capacities. If Teilhard's man h thoroughly at home in the universe, Arcndt's man uneasily coexists with it. When Arendt describes political action as a straight line in a universe of circularity, the line must not be taken as a path (either upward or downward) marked out by nature but as a sword thrust into nature. Human activity is not in and through nature but against it and in spite of it; it is not the smooth process of natural evolution but the sudden intrusion into nature of something unexplainable by any natural laws, Newtonian or post-Newtonian. Since man is the only surprise in a universe of calculables, it follows that human action consists in reasserting and augmenting man's un- predictability, his unnaturalncss, his insistence upon not being n phenomenon. If man did nothing but his housework, he would, from the stand- point of what he left behind for future generations, be no different from the birds who work industriously, even "intelligently," but begin nothing new. The extradordinary act, then, is that which runs counter to nature's circular pattern of birth, procreation, death. What set men apart from beasts is their capacity to defy nature by starting something new in a universe otherwise bound to a BS Sec infra*</page><page sequence="17">120 GEORGE MC ΚΕΝΝΛ cycle of eternal recurrence. What makes politics extraordinary is that men leave the privacy of the household, meet together in public, and decide to undertake something new, something which then enters into history. When those first primitive men decided to move the log, they cleared a path for human history to begin. Politics, Arendt would agree, h "mundane," for by "world" she means "the human artifice," the works of man which create a culture in which subsequent generations may be nourished and to which they in turn will contribute. It is here that Arendt's philosophy becomes concerned with the problem of the perishability or "futility" of politics. The danger, as Arendt sees it, is that unless someone is around to see and record the extraordinary deeds of man, they will sink into oblivion without a trace. Speeches and deeds, considered by themselves, "lack not only the tangibility of other things, but are even less durable and more futile than the things which we produce for consumption.84 Politics is "as futile as life itself."88 Human greatness, seen in terms of man's extraordinary words and deeds, requires some means of preservation. Arendt suggests two: "The whole factual world of human affairs depends for its reality and its continued existence, first, upon the presence of others who have seen and heard and will remember, and, second, on the transformation of the intangible into the tangibility of things." 0e The first condition assumes a body politic which will not only be witness but have sufficient durability to pass from genera- tion to generation the record of human greatness. This was the role assumed by the ancient polis which was supposed to "offer a remedy for the futility of action and speech." 8T The polis - if we trust the famous words of Pericles in the Funeral Oration - gives a guaranty that those who forced every sea and land to become the scene of their daring will not remain without witness . . .; without assistance from others, those who acted will be able to establish together the everlasting remem- M The Human Condition, p. 82. "5 Ibid., p. 93. It would appear that Arendt is contradicting what she said about politics in comparing it wttfi violence (supra); there she suggests that what makes politics different from violence is that politics is not futile. What she means, however, is that politics has the potential of being remembered, for there is some- thing for the historian to remember, whereas violence can never escape futility bcause by itself it is nothing but destruction. Rut even though all great (feeds have the potential of not being forgotten, this does not mean that they will be remem- bered. We remember Acnilles and Pericles, but how many other great men have been lost to history for want of a chronicler? 86 Ihid . n.

The task of the fabricator is to transfer the intangible "into the tangibility of things.1' In this connection she considers the role of historians, poets, sculpters, architects and the like, who "reify" or make into things the memory of human greatness. Zoon politiken, by himself, produces nothing; if his words and deeds are to be remem- bered, they must be recorded. "Acting and speaking men need the help of homo faher in his highest capacity, that is, the help of the artists, of poets and historiographers, of monument-builders or writers, because without them the only product of their activitiy, the story they enact and tell, would not survive at all.'' " The task of poets and historiographers thus "consists in making something lasting out of remembrance. They do this by translating praxis ond lexis, action and speech, into that kind of poeisis or fabrication which eventually becomes the written word." "° Fabrication in its "purest" form is a handmaiden or auxiliary to politics. When things are made not for use*1 but to endure and commemorate the great words and deeds of man, they put the stamp of immortality upon the activities of mor- tal men. This brings us to the role which Hannah Arendt has assumed. Arendt is convinced that for a number of reasons, the meaning of politics as the ancients understood it - the meaning of politics explored in this essay - has become lost or obscured over the past nineteen centuries sinr&lt;* the decline of Rome. It is this "lost treasure" which Arendt attempts to unearth, not simply for the sake of schol- arly curiousity, but with the hope that modern man may derive lessons from it. In other words, Arendt herself has undertaken the role of "homo faher in his highest capacity": in being a philosopher of politics, she must also be an historian commemorating what other- "Ibid. ew Ibid., p. 153. 90 The Rcvicxv of Politics, XX, 573-574.

But it is not only the "lost treasures" of the past that she would have us remember as a means of understanding and perhaps even beginning to resolve our predicament. We need also to remember how we got into the predicament in the first place. Some of the forgotten fragments of the past such as those which set the stage for the appearance of modern alienation, mass society and totalitar- ianism also have to be recalled so as to "free" ourselves from their "burden," for the past presses upon the present"8 and shapes it. "Not even oblivion and confusion, which can cover up so efficiently the origin and responsibility for every single deed, are able to undo a deed or prevent its consequences.""1 In her study of totalitarianism, for example, she attempts to isolate those events of the past two centuries which became the chief elements of present-day crisis. These events, or at least their connection with totalitarianism, have become obscure. Nevertheless, this "subterranean stream," as she calls it in her preface to The Origins of Totalitarianism, "has finally come to the surface and usurped the dignity of our tradition."" To find the source of this stream and to survey its course before it broke the surface - in less metaphorical language, to find the hidden con- nections between events in our past and the crises of our own times - is not an easy task, and in many ways it is painful both to writer and reader because it raises the question of what might have been. Nevertheless, Arendt believes that the "tears of remembrance" are cathartic and essential to understanding our present predicament. The scene where Ulysses listens to the story of his own life is paradigmatic for both history and poetry; the "reconciliation with reality," the catharsis, which, according to Aristotle, was the essence of tragedy, and, according to Hegel, was the ulti- mate purpose of history, came about through remembrance/'1 The task which Hannah Arendt has set for herself as political philosopher and historian is to bring the forgotten past to our atten- tion-not only its "lost treasures" but also its "subterranean streams." βί The Review of Politics, XV, p. 77.
