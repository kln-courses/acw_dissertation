<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Spirit of Falsehood ESTHER J. H AMORI Union Theological Seminary New York, NY 10027 According to the biblical picture, the heavenly realm is teeming with life. Many types of divine beings have long been recognized, such as the ļūttf, the trailD, and the □"'EHitf. Just as these terms refer to divine beings characterized in specific and recognizable ways, there is another category of the divine population with its own identifying features and narrative function. Several meanings of the term mi are familiar (wind, breath, spirit, inclination, and various overlaps),1 but there is also a category of divine being by this name, repeatedly characterized according to a particular role, once called the "spirit of falsehood." Although the spirit of falsehood ("Ipttf mi) of Micaiah's throne vision in 1 Kings 22 is well known, the tradition generally remains unacknowledged in other texts and in schol- arly pictures of divine society as a whole, from works on the divine council to the Dictionary of Deities and Demons ? 1 The term can refer to spirit (most commonly the spirit of Yhwh), breath, wind, and mood or inclination. The logical overlaps are especially clear between breath and wind (e.g., the breath of God's mouth), and between mood and spirit (e.g., a jealous spirit [Num 5: 14]). The overlap between breath and spirit is evident, for example, in Ezek 37:9, where Ezekiel is told that there is "no breath in the bones," and to "prophesy to the breath" (as if the breath of life has a life of its own). The overlap between spirit and wind may be observed, for instance, in Ezekiel 1 , where the wind comes with four figures in it, and then the spirit carries Ezekiel away in the wind (i.e., the spirit moves him). Some texts reflect these double meanings because of their natural overlaps; others seem to ring of wordplay based on knowledge of the overlapping ideas. 2 The term "falsehood" appears in the Dictionary of Deities and Demons , but much of the short discussion concerns false prophecy. Hans-Peter Müller ("Falsehood," in Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible [ed. Karel van der Toorn, Bob Becking, and Pieter W. van der Horst; Leiden/New York: Brill, 1995] 325-26) adds only that "[i]n combination with the word rûah, 'spirit', šeqer can personify the notion of falsehood in the Hebrew Bible." The term "evil spirit of God" appears as well, but the perspective of P. Kyle McCarter ("Evil Spirit of God," in Dictionary ; 319- 15</page><page sequence="2">16 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 72,2010 Biblical references to a mi of falsehood outside of 1 Kings 22 have been read in the same light as the jealous spirit (nNJp"mi) of Num 5:14, for example, or the spirit of grace and supplication (D^unm ļn mi) in Zech 12:10. The lpt2? mi of 1 Kings 22, however, is the only specific spirit we see in the Hebrew Bible with individual identity and agency, with the clear exception of the spirit of Yhwh (which functions differently). Only in the case of the mi of falsehood is it clear that we definitely have a tradition of a specific non- Yhwh spirit; the sole question is the extent of that tradition. The phrase lpt2? mi occurs in one text, but references to a mi sent by God in order to bring destructive justice through deceit occur in sev- eral more. A larger study of Near Eastern spirits would be intriguing, but for the pres- ent, a few notes on Mesopotamian demons and spirits should establish a general context for the mi. The Mesopotamian material, as we will see for the Israelite data, includes a range of ideas. There should be no contrived attempt to create a unified picture in either case or to draw a one-to-one correspondence between the two. In an overview of some basic points, however, certain similarities are evi- dent. Spirits in Mesopotamian literature are often conceived of as related to wind. Similar to the Hebrew mi, the Akkadian šāru can refer to wind, to breath (the breath of the gods, the breath of life, the breath of humans), and to spirits.3 Vari- ous types of demons also are described at times as having an ethereal nature. The collection utukku limnûti (incantations against evil spirits, demons, and the like) includes vivid descriptions of many of these. For instance, one incantation describes "the evil spirits [utukku] that chase the great storms. . . . Through the door like a snake they glide, through the hinge like a wind they blow"; another includes an alû demon that has no form, and one that will envelop a man.4 In many texts, various types of spirits and demons are listed in a series: utukku limnu alû limnu ekimmu limnu gallû limnu ilu limnu rabisu limnu, in R. Campbell Thompson's classic translation, "evil spirit, evil demon, evil ghost, evil devil, evil 20) is that it "serves in the narrative as an objectification of Yhwh's abandonment of Saul." While both of these entries include references to the story of the spirit of falsehood in 1 Kings 22, neither one identifies the m"l as a type of divine being that appears in other texts as well. 3 On the development of the Akkadian šāru as comparable to the Latin anima , see Marcel Leibovici, "Génies et Démons en Baby Ionie," in Dimitri Meeks et al., Génies, anges, et démons: Egypte, Babylone, Israël, Islam, Peuples Altaïques, Inde, Birmanie, Asie du Sud-Est, Tibet, Chine (Sources Orientales 8; Paris: Seuil, 1971) 85-1 12, here 87. See also CAD, Š II, 135b. The word also frequently means "falsehood" or "lies," presumably related to the ideas of air, emptiness, vanity; see CAD, Š II, 139b- 140a. 4 R.

One incantation includes the first four: The evil Spirit, the evil Demon, the evil Ghost, the evil Devil, From the earth have come forth; From the Underworld (?) unto the land they have come forth, In heaven they are unknown, On earth they are not understood, They know not how to stand, They know not how to sit, No food they eat, No water they drink.6 A number of incantations against "the seven evil spirits" are particularly well known and include similar portrayals of formless spirits. For instance: They are seven, they are seven . . . They are not male, they are not female, They are drifting phantoms, They take no wife, they beget no son. They know neither sparing of life nor mercy, They heed no prayers nor entreaties. They are steeds that grew up in the mountains, They are the evil ones of Ea . . . ? The reference to the "drifting phantoms" as "the evil ones of Ea" should not be taken to indicate that spirits were always considered to be evil.8 Many types of spirits and demons acted as divine agents with both positive and negative functions. The divine agent is generally neutral, sent for the benefit or detriment of the recip- ient, depending on the will of the god. There is ample textual evidence for this, such as in references to both good spirits and evil spirits, good demons and evil demons, and so on. Anthony Green points also to the specific iconographie similarities between "beneficent and protective spirits" and "evil beings" of various kinds. He argues on the basis of this evidence that "we should guard against a rigid division, in considering Mesopotamian spirits, between the good and the evil: at times, per- haps, the beneficence or malevolence of individual spirits depended more upon their works at any given time than upon their essential natures."9 5 For example, ibid., tablet III, 1 :2-3; and tablet XVI, 1 : 106-7. 6 Ibid., tablet CC, 2:134-35. 7 Translation of Benjamin R.

A few scholars have observed a similarity between the "spirit of falsehood" (Ipttf mi) of 1 Kings 22 and the "evil spirit" or "harmful spirit" (nsn mi) that comes upon Saul in 1 Samuel 16-19. These observations have not included significant comparison, however, or an examination of the role of the nil. A few commentators have mentioned one or both of these texts in connection with Judg 9:23-24, in which God sends a "harm- ful spirit" (n$n mi) between Abimelech and the Shechemites, but these too have generally addressed either the cause or the effect of the incident, not the agent. In fact, at least eight biblical texts portray a mi identifiable as a divine being serving a specific function. This function is more closely related to the divine court context of 1 Kings 22 than to contexts in which mi means "inclination," such as the "spirit of [or inclination to] jealousy" in Num 5:14, though that is how almost all of these texts have been read. In each of these eight texts, a divinely sent mi causes a person or group of people to hear falsehood or otherwise be deceived, sometimes accompanied by terror. The purpose is judgment-related, as the one afflicted with falsehood is shown to have been in the wrong already. The result is often death to a king (usually violent) or removal of political opponents, ensuring Israel's security and preserving God's plan for the elect. A survey of these texts will demonstrate the existence of a recurring biblical tradition of a mi as divine agent, specifically associated with bringing destructive justice by means of falsehood. This is not to imply that there is one "Spirit of Falsehood" in many texts, a sin- gle figure with a permanent title. Rather, various texts include references to an untitled mi who fits within a particular role that is recognizable by a tight cluster of identifying features. The use of mi terminology (rather than or no refer- ence at all to an intermediating divine being) is bound to a specific kind of work that Yhwh wants to have accomplished, according to each narrative. These texts can be understood in the framework of the description of the lpt2? mi explicit in 1 Kings 22. Of these eight texts, five texts (or sets of texts) bear clear connections to the tradition of the spirit of falsehood: 1 Kgs 22:19-23; texts from 1 Samuel (16:14-23; 18:10-12; and 19:9-10); Judg 9:23-24; 2 Kgs 19:7; and Isa 19:13-14. Three more texts (or sets of texts) reflect related traditions. These include Isa 29:9-10; Job 4:12-21; and texts from Hosea (4:12; 5:4; 9:7; and 12:2). I. The Deceiving Spirit A. 1 Kings 22:19-23 The nature of the mi as a divine being is most evident in Micaiah's throne vision of 1 Kgs 22:19-23 (2 Chr 18:18-22). The prophet Micaiah relays a graphic vision of the divine council in action. He sees Yhwh on the throne, and all the host of heaven standing to the right and to the left; Yhwh asks who will entice Ahab to</page><page sequence="5">THE SPIRIT OF FALSEHOOD 1 9 go to his death, and one says this and another that. "The spirit" (min) comes forth and volunteers to go be(come) a lying spirit (Ipttf mi) in the mouth of all the prophets, in a scene rather reminiscent of Job 1-2. In Job also a divine being steps forward from the group of anonymous figures and throws out a suggestion to Yhwh. The use of the definite article at the first mention of the spirit suggests that the divine being in this narrative too has its own role, as ļūttfn does in Job l.10 In the case of Micaiah's vision in 1 Kings 22, the role of the mi is to be the inciter of deceitful speech, to delude the prophets. 1 1 It is clear from Micaiah's next words that Yhwh's purpose in sending the mi is related to destructive justice. After describing his vision to Ahab, Micaiah tells him, "Yhwh has decreed evil for you" (ni? 1 1DÌ mni). A royal prophet named Zedekiah promptly strikes Micaiah and says, "How did the spirit of Yhwh pass from me to speak with you?!"12 Although Zedekiah intends this as an insult to Micaiah's seemingly arrogant claim, he inadvertently speaks the truth from the author's perspective: the spirit of Yhwh is not with Ahab and his prophets but with Micaiah. Yhwh has sent this mi to bring evil to the king, whose prophet acknowledges - if ironically - that he no longer has the spirit of Yhwh. This replacement of the spirit of Yhwh with the destructive spirit of falsehood appears again in many of the following mi texts.13 B. 1 Samuel 16:14-23 ; 18:10-12 ; and 19:9-10 In 1 Sam 16:14-23; 18:10-12; and 19:9-10, Saul is sent into fits of delusion by a mi. In chaps. 16 and 18, the mi is described as both a "harmful spirit from Yhwh" (mm DNE nsrrmi) and a "harmful spirit of God" (ni 71 D^N'mi). The ref- erence in chap. 19 is to a "harmful spirit of Yhwh" (ni71 mm mi). The movements of this mi are described in terms very similar to those of the spirit of Yhwh in chaps. 16-19. Both spirits can fall upon someone: "the spirit of Yhwh fell upon 10 Jerome T. Walsh (/ Kings [Berit Olam; Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1996] 351) sug- gests that the definite article shows the uniqueness of the m"l in the divine court, but goes on to say that this means that "it is 'the spirit of Yhwh,' the spirit to which the prophets regularly ascribe their divine inspiration." 11 Or as Iain Provan (/ and 2 Kings [OTG; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997] 165) writes, an "agent provocateur." 12 All translations are my own. 13 A few scholars have noted similarities between this and other passages. Mordechai Cogan ( I Kings: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary [AB 10; New York: Doubleday, 2001 ] 492) mentions the story of Judges 9 but also Yhwh hardening Pharaoh's heart, indicating that his point of comparison is Yhwh's agency, not the role of the nil. Similarly, Gene Rice ( Nations under God: A Commentary on the Book of 1 Kings [ITC; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1990] 187) makes a parenthetical reference to Judg 9:23 and Isa 19:14, both of which will be discussed here, but also to Judg 14:4 and Isa 19:2, where there is no reference to the mi.</page><page sequence="6">20 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 72,2010 David," ili"1?** mrr-rrn n^xril ( 1 6: 1 3); "the harmful spirit of God fell upon Saul," nyi cm1?** mi (18: 10).

The parallel roles of the two spirits are evident also in the initial note in 1 Sam 16:14 that the spirit of Yhwh first departs from Saul, and then a harmful spirit from Yhwh falls upon him. This is evident again in 18:12, which reemphasizes that Yhwh is with David but had departed from Saul.14 This is analogous to 1 Kings 22, in which the king loses the spirit of Yhwh, and in exchange his prophets receive the spirit of falsehood. For biblical authors, it seems to be a basic rule of cosmic physics that no two spirits can occupy the same space at the same time. The precise relationship between the nyi mi and Yhwh is unclear. This harm- ful spirit from Yhwh can fall upon persons and cause them to prophesy ( 1 8: 1 0), as "the spirit of Yhwh/God" does elsewhere (including 19:20-25). This would indi- cate a similar type of identification between each spirit and Yhwh, the crucial dif- ference being that from the authors' perspectives, the "spirit of Yhwh" brings true prophecy and the "harmful spirit from Yhwh" is connected to delusional behavior. (As will be discussed later, it is not necessary to assume either that the harmful spirit is always identified with God, or that it is always a separate divine being.) The implication is not that Saul's ecstatic prophecy or "raving" in 18:10 is in itself false, but that this mi both deludes and causes prophecy. In 1 Kings 22, Yhwh sends a mi to inspire false prophecy, which leads to the death of the king. In the Samuel texts, Yhwh sends a mi to inspire delusion in Saul; the consequences contribute directly to Saul's downfall, and the path is cleared for Yhwh's chosen king. 14 P. Kyle McCarter (7 Samuel: A New Translation [AB 8; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1980] 280-81) notes that the one spirit comes after the other leaves, so that "the infusion of spirit is never neutral." However, he compares this incident to mental illness and places the evil spirit "from Yhwh" in quotation marks. Some scholars discussing this text mention the similarity to 1 Kings 22; see, e.g., David Jobling (7 Samuel [Berit Olam; Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1998] 90). Ralph W. Klein (7 Samuel [WBC 10; Waco: Word, 1983] 165) notes 1 Kings 22 and Judges 9 as well, but also Deut 13:2-4; Amos 3:6; and 2 Sam 24:1, indicating that he too is addressing the goal but not the agent.</page><page sequence="7">THE SPIRIT OF FALSEHOOD 2 1 C. Judges 9:23-24 Judges 9:23-24 mentions another human encounter with a nsn mi. Abimelech, Gideon's son by his concubine, aligns himself with his mother's She- chemite relatives and has Gideon's seventy sons killed, with the exception of Jotham. After this, Abimelech rules Israel for three years. Then God sends a mi nsn between Abimelech and the Shechemites. Strife and duplicity ensue as the Shechemites deal treacherously (li^CTI) with Abimelech. The statement of cause and effect is clear: "Then God sent a harmful spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech," ram ddu; -pm rn raí mi (9:23). This treachery results in the death of a thousand Shechemites and the violent death of Abimelech, as a woman drops an upper millstone on his head and an attendant stabs him to death. As in 1 Kings 22 and 1 Samuel 16-19, the spirit in Judges 9 is an instigator of deception, with now familiar consequences. The intended result of this deceit is made plain: God sends a harmful spirit between these parties "in order that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers" (v. 24). The theme of deception continues through v. 3 1 , in which Zebul sends messengers to Abimelech deceitfully (nïïim).15 Zebul then tricks Gaal - perhaps the deceitful intention referenced in v. 31 - and shortly thereafter nearly everyone involved is dead. As in 1 Kings 22 and 1 Samuel 16-19, God uses a mi of deceit to vindicate those who are on God's side and to depose those who are not. Here God vindicates the seventy sons of Jerubbaal and wipes out all others. This divine motive for sending the mi is repeated in the conclusion to the story: God repaid both Abimelech and the sons of Shechem for what they had done (9:56-57). As seen in 1 Kings, where the lying spirit is in the mouth of all the prophets, the one spirit can affect many. This is not merely a use of the term mi to signify mood or inclination, as though a feeling arose in both Abimelech and the Shechemites. God sends the mi of harm between the two parties; the harm is tied to deception, and the result is death to those portrayed as unjust. As in 1 Kings, the mi affects all at once.16 15 The textual apparatus in BHS suggests nttllfrG because the function of deceitfulness in the passage has not been recognized. BDB, 941a,b, likewise notes for nft"in in this verse, "meaning unsuitable." However, the meaning of HETiri is as clear as that of the other three nouns derived from (piel) nm, "to beguile," each of which is used in parallel to "ipU7: rpft*"iri ("deceitfulness") in Jer 23:26 and Ps 119:1 18; rPB"l ("deceit") in Mie 6:12; Pss 120:2; 101:7; and niï"1iï ("deceit") in Amos 8:5. 16 Several scholars who discuss Judges 9 mention 1 Samuel 16 and/or 1 Kings 22, but none</page><page sequence="8">22 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 72,2010 D. 2 Kings 19:7 The spirit of falsehood is referred to again in 2 Kgs 19:7 (Isa 37:7). The prophet Isaiah tells Hezekiah's messengers to say to the king, "Thus says Yhwh: 'Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me; I will put a spirit in him ['n ļrfl ITH] and he will hear a rumor and return to his land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his land" (2 Kgs 19:6-7). As in 1 Kings 22, the function of the ITH is to deceive. It is unclear whether the mi here causes false speech to the king by inspiring the rumor (as in 1 Kings 22), or only causes the king to believe the false speech. In either case, the king is deceived through this ITH sent by Yhwh, and as a direct result ends up dead, as in 1 Kings 22 and Judges 9. The emphasis on deceit is apparent again in the pleasant touch of irony as the messengers of the king of Assyria tell Hezekiah not to be deceived by his God in whom he trusts (ļK^'^N "■prfrtf [19:10]). In addition, the Rabshakeh yells to all present not to let Hezekiah deceive them (irppīil DD1? [18:29]). God seems to retort, "I'll show you deceit."17 explains the role of the mi. Victor H. Matthews {Judges and Ruth [New Cambridge Bible Com- mentary; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004] 109) refers to these two texts, but inter- prets mi in the sense of inclination, citing "growing disaffection (i.e., 'evil intentions') between the leaders of Shechem and Abimelech." Carolyn Pressler {Joshua, Judges, and Ruth [Westminster Bible Companion; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2002] 1 89-90) also mentions 1 Sam 16: 14-17 and 1 Kgs 22:21-23, but concludes that "the stories assert that God destroys destructive powers," with no reference to the ITH. John Gray {Joshua, Judges, Ruth [NCB; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1986] 306) notes a "rough analogy" to 1 Kings 22, and Robert G. Boling {Judges: Introduction, Translation, and Commentary [AB 6; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1975] 175-76) cites 1 Kings 22 and explains that "evil spirits from the deity . . . stand generally for the utterly inexplicable." J. Alberto Soggin {Judges: A Commentary [trans. John Bowden; OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1981] 181), who also mentions the two passages, remarks that "it is characteristic of the present text that this spirit here acts independently, interposing itself between the two parties," although he goes no fur- ther in his discussion of the mi. 17 Most commentators dealing with this passage do not address the issue of the mi at all. See, e.g., Robert L. Cohn, 2 Kings (Berit Olam; Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2000); Burke O. Long, 2 Kings (FOTL 10; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1991); Walter Brueggemann, 2 Kings (Knox Preaching Guides; Atlanta: John Knox, 1982); Prován, 1 and 2 Kings ; John Goldingay, Isaiah (NIBC, Old Testament 13; Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2001); and Marvin A. Sweeney, Isaiah 1-39: With an Introduction to Prophetic Literature (FOTL 16; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996). Mordechai Cogan and Hayim Tadmor {II Kings: A New Translation [AB 1 1; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1988] 234) include a reference to 1 Kings 22, but without comment. On Isa 37:7, Joseph Blenkinsopp {Isaiah 1-39: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary [AB 19; New York: Doubleday, 2000] 475) refers to "a kind of mind control or psychological conditioning," which he explains as follows: "Yhwh can therefore also work by bringing about changes of mood or instill- ing presentiments of disaster and death." As is the case with so many commentators on the first sev- eral passages above, Blenkinsopp discusses the effect of Yhwh 's plans, but not the agent.</page><page sequence="9">THE SPIRIT OF FALSEHOOD 23 E. Isaiah 19:13-14 Isaiah 19: 13-14 presents a similar picture. Earlier in the oracle it is stated that Yhwh will incite the Egyptians against one another (a familiar concept from Judges 9), so that brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. Egypt will be emptied of its spirit, and Yhwh will confuse its counsel inxs?1). The people will resort to divination (in the biblical authors' view, false prophecy), consulting idols, ghosts, and medi- ums ( 1 9:2-3). After a vivid portrayal of the consequence to the Egyptian people and to the land itself, the oracle continues, "The princes of Zoan have become foolish, the princes of Memphis have been deceived [IXttfa, as in 2 Kgs 18:27 and 19:10 above]; the chiefs of her tribes have caused Egypt to stumble [lit., 'led Egypt astray,' lynn]" (v. 13). The very next words provide the explanation for this: "Yhwh has mixed within her a spirit of distortion [D^iy nil]; they shall cause Egypt to stumble [lit., Mead Egypt astray'] in all her doings, like the stumbling of a drunk in his vomit" (v. 14). The verb iynn, used repeatedly in this text, primarily means "to lead astray." The English phrase chosen here, "to cause to stumble," is meant to capture the double meaning of going astray and falling down drunk. This is the result of Yhwh's intention to lead the people astray, deceiving the princes of Memphis, so that they should cause Egypt to stumble. Yhwh accomplishes this through a CTTO mi. The themes of counsel and deception run through the entire oracle. In v. 3, Yhwh will confuse Egypt's counsel, and they will inquire (IttTlTl) of idols and the like. Verse 1 1 states that the princes of Zoan are fools (D^IN) and that the wisdom of Pharaoh's counselors has become stupid (or brutish). In addition to the repeated references to foolishness and stupidity through a variety of colorful terms, the root fSP appears six times in this passage and the root DDn appears three times. The apparent emphasis is that the wise men of Egypt are already viewed as foolish counselors. Yhwh sends the spirit of distortion, asking, "Where are your wise men now?" Once again, Yhwh sends a spirit to those already deluded. Egypt's spirit leaves, and Yhwh replaces it with a spirit that causes distortion and confusion. It should not be surprising that Yhwh sends a spirit that affects the leaders of Egypt and, through them, the nation; consider the crucial role of Ahab's court prophets in 1 Kings 22. Here again, part of the effect will be a change in kingship, as Egypt is delivered over to a new harsh ruler ( 1 9:4). Verse 1 7 states that the land will become a terror (like David to Saul). As in 1 Kings 22; 1 Samuel 16-19; and Judges 9, Yhwh gives a spirit that causes delusion to those who are opposed to Yhwh and to Yhwh's chosen. Once again, the reference is not to a feeling or inclination that arises among the people; Yhwh mixes within Egypt this one spirit, which affects the many, as in 1 Kings 22 and Judges 9. 18 18 Blenkinsopp notes that Hos 5:4 and Isa 29: 10 (both to be discussed here) are comparable, but with no further commentary ( Isaiah 1-39, 315).</page><page sequence="10">24 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 72,2010 Each of the preceding five texts tells of a mi sent by God that brings false- hood. In each case, this deception or delusion leads to death, violence, or terror for those already deemed to be in the wrong. Several more texts may represent a sec- ond level of tradition, perhaps reflecting knowledge of the idea of a Ipttf mi. II. Related Texts A. Isaiah 29:9-10 The prophecy to Jerusalem in Isa 29: 10 has related implications: "For Yhwh has poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep [HüTin mi], and has shut your eyes, the prophets, and covered your heads, the seers." The sense of mi here may overlap with inclination and also reflect familiarity with the tradition of the spirit of false- hood. The spirit is spread over Jerusalem by Yhwh and causes prophets to stop prophesying. The likelihood of a connection between this and the tradition of a deceiving spirit is increased in light of the context of the reference. The previous chapter describes Jerusalem as already blinded and deceived, and Isa 28:15 says, "We have made deception [DTD] our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with falsehood [IptP]." The oracle of Isaiah 29 begins with Yhwh's declared intent to encamp against Jerusalem (vv. 2-3), and it contains repeated statements indicating that Jerusalem is seen as already in the wrong. These statements lead to the descrip- tion of the intended effect of the mi: "Linger and delay, blind yourselves and be blind! Become drunken, but not with wine - stagger, but not with drink," inttnttnn IDtf ÍÒ1 1573 lIDtf 1JHZ/1 lytfyriwn iram (v. 9). And why? "Because Yhwh has poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep," Hftiin mi mm DD^y (v. 10). These people, already characterized by deception (DTD) and falsehood (Ipttf), with Yhwh set against them, are now afflicted with a mi that causes the same symptoms as drunkenness (delay, "blindness," and staggering). In Isa 19:14 as well, Yhwh sends a mi that causes people to stagger as if drunk. Without placing this text in the first tier of direct references to a spirit that brings deception, it should be noted that these intoxication-like symptoms are in the delusion family. These effects of the mi accompany the cessation of prophecy. B. Job 4:12-21 Job 4:12-21 presents an altogether different picture of a mi. Eliphaz says, a word was brought stealthily to me, my ear caught a whisper of it; amidst unsettling thoughts from visions at night, when deep sleep [naTin] falls upon people, fear came over me, and trembling, and made me shudder to the bone [lit., 'caused dread to all of my bones']. A mi passed me by; the hair of my flesh bristled; it halted, but I did not recognize its appearance [intciö T3N xV]; a form [mían] was before my eyes. I heard</page><page sequence="11">THE SPIRIT OF FALSEHOOD 25 a whisper, and a voice: "Can humankind be more righteous than God? Can one be purer than one's Maker?" (4:12-it)1 9 As different as this text is from those previously discussed, there are impor- tant points of similarity. First, it is noteworthy that the function of the mi here is to transmit a message. R. N. Whybray points out that the use of the word sug- gests prophecy in particular.20 Also note the rare use of HftTin, as in Isa 29:10. With the exception of Prov 19:15, where the word indicates the sluggish sleep brought on by laziness, TO7in always refers to a deep sleep caused by Yhwh. The phrase reappears in Job 33:15, during the great rant of Elihu, and this time the ref- erence is explicitly to a nttìin caused by Yhwh in order to facilitate divine-human communication. The same concept can be assumed for Eliphaz's speech. It is in the midst of this Httìin, Eliphaz claims, that the mi transmits its message. The mi tells Eliphaz what he already wants to hear (compare especially the role of the lying spirit to the court prophets in 1 Kings 22). Notably, in the context of the book, the indictment is not a fair charge against Job. It seems that the words of the mi sent by God in this case are not necessarily false per se, but false in their application to Job. This may be an example of an author playing with the tradition of the spirit of falsehood, using the mi here as a signal that while the words ring true, the message is deceptive. In addition, it is of course ironic that Eliphaz, who is already in the wrong in the context of the story, uses the mi to argue his case. This text contains one striking difference from the previous mi texts. The mi passes by as it speaks; the perception is visual, auditory, and sensory, as Eliphaz claims that his flesh bristled. The mi causes in him a reaction of hair- raising dread, trembling, and shaking (note the association of the mi with terror, as in 1 Samuel 16 and Isaiah 19). Moreover, Eliphaz refers to the appearance of the form (the HNItt of the rttl&amp;n). We know from Micaiah's vision in 1 Kings 22 that the mi has a bodily form in heaven; in the vision of Eliphaz, the mi is in some sense embodied on earth.21 19 In his next words, the mi also accuses divine beings of being fallible. According to its own logic, the spirit acknowledges that it may be in error. It is hard to know whether this makes the spirit more or less trustworthy. One might remember here of the words of Epimenides the Cretan, "all Cretans are liars." 20 But with a "furtive character," implied by the terms "to steal" and "to whisper" (R. N. Whybray, Job [Readings: A New Biblical Commentary; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998] 42). 21 Most discussion of the episode in Job deals with the theological content of the speech of the mi, not the speaker. For example, several scholars note that the message is ironically obvious (e.g., Whybray, Job, 42; James A. Wharton, Job [Westminster Bible Companion; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1999] 29; and C. S. Rodd, The Book of Job [Epworth Commentaries; London: Epworth, 1990] 15). As for the mi itself, however, commentary is scarce. Michael Fishbane (" The Book of Job and Inner-Biblical Discourse," in The Voice from the Whirlwind: Interpreting the Book of Job [ed. Leo G. Perdue and W. Clark Gilpin; Nashville: Abingdon, 1992] 86-98, here 96, 215) does not</page><page sequence="12">26 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 72,2010 To be sure, the tradition of the ITH who deceives is expressed with a range of language and nuance. As in 1 Kings 22, this text portrays the mi as strongly per- sonalized with a single mind, agency, and presence. A mi may be like a in this way: some texts portray Wlìòft as personalized and embodied; other texts describe voices from heaven; and most leave the form unspecified.22 Within this variety, the identification of the divine being stems not from a consistent form but from a recognizable function. C. Hosea 4:12; 5:4; 9:7; and 12:2 The Book of Hosea contains an interesting assortment of references to a ÎTI1. Hosea 4:12 says of Israel, "a spirit of fornication [D^l^T mi] has led them astray [nynn]." Although mi here clearly has the potential to be interpreted in the sense of inclination, the use of the verb nyn in the hiphil (here nynn] shows the same function that it did in Isa 19:14 (there plural, lynn). In Isaiah 19, Yhwh mixed within Egypt a "spirit of distortion" (0^137 mi), and the chiefs of her tribes led her astray (lynn). In Hosea 4 the people are turning to the wrong source for divination (i.e., "false" prophecy), as in Isaiah 19, and it is a mi that misleads them. It was seen in many of the previously discussed passages that Yhwh sends a deceiving spirit to those who are viewed as already in the wrong. The cause is specified here. In Hos 5:4 it is stated that the people cannot return to their God because the spirit of fornication is (still) within them. As in several of the other passages, the people cannot have both this mi and the presence of God at the same time. This indicates that the term mi here may well refer to something more than a feeling or inclina- tion. The people's wrongdoing is made explicit also in 5:5, where Israel's stum- bling is attributed to pride. All of this is prefaced in 4:6 by the assertion, "because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you as my priest. You have forgotten the teaching of your God; I also will forget your children." As in 1 Kings 22 and Isaiah 19, the spirit is sent to people who have already chosen falsehood. address the identity of the figure, and Rodd ( Book of Job, 15) asserts that "it is beside the point to inquire whether the mysterious visitant is an 'angel.' . . . The essential point is that what Eliphaz meets is a messenger from God with a revelation for him." Whybray translates mi here as "wind," compares Ezekiel's stormy wind (Ezek 1:4) and Elijah's still small voice (1 Kgs 19:12), and con- cludes that "the author was probably not concerned to produce a coherent picture" {Job, 43). Inter- estingly, David Wolfers {Deep Things out of Darkness : The Book of Job. Essays and a New English Translation [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995] 380-81) calls the vision a "fraudulent device," com- paring it to Jer 24:25-27, in which some claim "I had a dream, 1 had a dream!" Ironically, although most commentators do not try to identify the mi, there is more detail in the description of this divine being than in the majority of texts. 22 For full discussion, see Esther J. Hamori, " When Gods Were Men The Embodied God in Biblical and Near Eastern Literature (BZAW 384; Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 2008), chap. 5.</page><page sequence="13">THE SPIRIT OF FALSEHOOD 27 The text of Hos 4: 12-5:4 taken alone might still be interpreted as referring to an inclination to fornication; however, the possibility that Hosea is referring specif- ically to a deceiving spirit seems greater in light of the following two passages. The phrase in 9:7, traditionally translated "the inspired man is mad" (min WK VWÌ2), is not a reference to a spirit of falsehood, but the connection between prophecy, madness, and mi is strongly reminiscent of the experience of Saul under the influ- ence of the mi. Hosea's final suggestive mention of the spirit comes in 12:1-2: "Ephraim surrounds me with lying [Wi"D], the house of Israel with deceit [Httlft]. . . . Ephraim tends the wind [mi] and pursues the east wind." This is clearly a ref- erence to wind, not a literal mention of a divine being; but Hosea's fourth associ- ation of mi with lying and deceit cannot be overlooked.23 These three references taken together imply that Hosea, whether intending these references as allusions or as wordplay based on knowledge of the tradition, does know the tradition of the mi who misleads. III. Conclusions The first tier of the texts discussed may be taken as direct references to the tradition of a spirit of falsehood (1 Kgs 22:19-23; 1 Sam 16:14-23; 18:10-12; 19:9-10; Judg 9:23-24; 2 Kgs 19:7; Isa 19:13-14). The other texts may reflect a play on words or knowledge of the tradition (Isa 29:9-10; Job 4:12-21; Hos 4:12-5:4, especially in light of Hos 9:7 and 12:2). A few other texts ring of the familiar tradition but are rather more ambiguous. In Micah 2, the people are already planning iniquity and ceasing to speak (*1133, associated with prophecy). Micah 2:11 says, "If a man were going after wind [mi] and falsehood [lpt2?], lying [2ÎD]," and speaking (again fļttt) to the people about wine and liquor, he would be a spokesman for the people. As the passage contin- ues, Micah 3 is focused on the role of the prophets. Yhwh tells the prophets who are leading the people astray (nyn in the hiphil, as in Isaiah 19 and Hosea 4) that they will no longer be able to prophesy, whereas Micah has the mi of Yhwh. Psalm 104:4 may also reflect a nod to the tradition of a living mi who is a part of divine society, with use of mmi (here literally, "winds") in parallel with VDfrÒtt, "[Yhwh's] messengers." 23 Most commentators on Hosca do not mention the mi (e.g., Marvin A. Sweeney, The Twelve Prophets [Berit Olam; Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2000]; Bruce C. Birch, Hosea, Joel, and Amos [Westminster Bible Companion; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1997]). A. A. Macintosh (A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Hosea [ICC; Edinburgh: Clark, 1997] 152) remarks on 4:12 that "the word rûah in such a phrase denotes 'movement of the mind'" and compares 1 Kgs 22:23, but translates this as "lying impulse." He also notes Isa 19:14, but translates "perverse atti- tude" and includes the "fit of jealousy" of Num 5:14, which reflects a different sense of the word mi. Like many previously discussed commentators, he observes the effect of the mi but not the cause.</page><page sequence="14">28 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 72,2010 The mi in 1 Kings 22 volunteers to take on a specific function, and, were there only this text, we might conclude that it is an isolated oddity. There are, how- ever, many more texts that portray a nil with the same function. Among the eight nil texts discussed above, certain patterns are evident. The mi is connected to falsehood in all eight texts. Ahab's prophets are deceived; Saul is rendered delusional; Abimelech and the Shechemites act deceit- fully; Sennacherib is deceived through a rumor; the Egyptians' judgment is distorted - their princes are deceived and their counselors become stupid; prophets will become unable to prophesy, having concealed themselves with deception; Eliphaz 's misperception is confirmed by the spirit; and Israel is led astray. Seven of the eight spirits of falsehood are explicitly sent by God. The spirit in 1 Kings 22 was commissioned by Yhwh and seen in a prophetic vision; it is the harmful spirit from Yhwh who comes upon Saul in 1 Samuel; God sends the spirit between the two guilty parties in Judges 9; Yhwh puts the spirit into Sennacherib; Eliphaz sees the spirit in a vision, in his deep sleep (TOTin, virtually always given by Yhwh), saying that a word ("137, associated with prophecy) came to him; the mi is mixed into Egypt by Yhwh in Isaiah 1 9; it is poured out over Jerusalem by Yhwh in Isaiah 29. The mi is clearly under God's authority in these seven texts. The exception is Hosea, where God explains that the mi is the direct result of Israel's rejection of knowledge. The spirit of falsehood affects people viewed as being already in the wrong in all eight texts. Ahab's prophets are already giving false prophecy; Saul is king but not the chosen one, and the spirit of Yhwh has left him; Abimelech and the Shechemites are blatantly wicked and have set Abimelech up as ruler through fraudulent means; Sennacherib is making war against Israel and claiming arro- gantly that Hezekiah could not rely on his deceitful God; Eliphaz hears what he already believes and in the context of the book is inaccurate and arrogant; in Isaiah 19 all Egypt is already emptied of spirit and prone to foolish counsel; in Isaiah 29 all Jerusalem is already in a "refuge of lies"; and in Hosea Israel had already rejected God. All eight actions of the mi reveal previously existing spir- itual conditions; God turns evil over to evil, reveals blindness (Isa 29:9-10), idol- atry (Hosea), and false prophecy. Sometimes the emphasis seems to be on revealing existing falseness, as in 1 Kings 22. At other times, although there is also a previously existing condition, the emphasis comes across as a standard "confuse the enemy" battle plan, as in the defeat of Sennacherib through a rumor, or the deposing of Abimelech and the defeat of the Shechemites through instigating treachery. Other direct effects of the mi are shared among many texts as well. The mi is connected not only to falseness but to false prophecy particularly in five of the eight texts. Ahab's prophets speak lies, and Saul's ecstatic prophecy is described as part of his delusional behavior; Israel is led astray into divination in Hosea 4-5,</page><page sequence="15">THE SPIRIT OF FALSEHOOD 29 and the mi causes inability to prophesy in Isa 29:10. In three texts the mi also causes terror. Saul is terrified; Eliphaz is petrified, judging from his many refer- ences to hair-raising dread, trembling, and shaking; and Egypt suffers terror in Isaiah 19. Interestingly, the mi often affects a group of people: the prophets, Jerusalem, Egypt as a whole and the princes of Memphis in particular, Israel, or the Shechemites. In four of the five texts where the spirit affects an individual, how- ever, it is a national leader: Ahab, Saul, Abimelech, and Sennacherib. In five of the eight texts, another effect of the mi is an end to what is perceived as wrong ruler- ship. Ahab, Abimelech, and Sennacherib are killed; Saul is driven insane; and Egypt's wickedness seems to be "healed" in Isaiah 19 (v. 22 refers to "striking but healing"). This phenomenon is best explained by Wittgenstein's theory of "family resemblance," that is, that there is a small group of characteristics from which each of the texts draws.24 There is, then, a more widespread biblical tradition for a spirit of falsehood than has been previously recognized. Micaiah's vision of the spirit in the divine council was not an isolated image. The eight examples delineated here range from Judges, Samuel, and Kings through Isaiah and Hosea to Job. The picture through- out is consistent with the divine court context of 1 Kings 22, in which Yhwh uses the mi as a subversive messenger to bring destructive justice through deception to those who are already in the wrong. According to the tradition shared in these texts, Yhwh seems to use the spirit of falsehood in place of the divine spirit when the messages being given are false. Yhwh speaks the truth through the divine spirit and brings deception or delusion through the use of a spirit of falsehood. 1 Kings 22 and 1 Samuel 16-19 demon- strate that the two spirits cannot occupy the same place at the same time; 1 Samuel additionally emphasizes that the spirits function in a parallel manner. A note- worthy difference is that that spirit of Yhwh is recognized by its recipients, who proclaim that it has come upon them, and they proceed to announce or act upon the message they have received. A deceiving spirit, however, acts surreptitiously, as would suit Yhwh's purpose in sending it (since overt deception is unlikely to be effective). In addition, the "spirit" mode of divine communication would seem fit- ting in these texts, given the repeated connection to prophecy, even when "false." The form of the spirit is not clear. The comparison to angels can be illumi- nating here: they are indistinguishable from one another in the heavens, but take various forms that suit their functions when communicating with humans. An angel may appear as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night to lead the Israelites through the desert; it may appear in anthropomorphic form in order to have a conversation with Manoah; it may speak as a voice from the heavens above to point out a ram in the thicket for Abraham to sacrifice (perhaps literally, from a 24 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations (3rd ed.; trans. G. E. M. Anscombe; Oxford: Blackwell, 1958) 31-32, §§65-67</page><page sequence="16">30 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 72,2010 helpful bird's-eye view). Similarly, the form of a spirit of falsehood - intangible, able effectively to transmit a message unbeknownst to its recipient - reflects its function. The absence of face-to-face interaction in most texts is fitting for the pur- pose of deception. The issue of a divine being's embodied or disembodied nature is distinct from the issue of its "personal" nature. Given the Hebrew terminology (nil) with its overlapping meanings of spirit, wind, and breath, we should expect spirits to be dis- embodied, and the two texts that describe spirits in physical terms ( 1 Kings 22 and Job 4) are striking in this regard. This is quite separate from the question of whether a mi is "personal" - that is, whether it may have some agency or personal pres- ence in the way that a "1*08 does. (It is actually a minority of texts that describe anthropomorphic beings, and the majority of narratives are ambiguous regarding angelic form.) The covert, disembodied nature of the m"1 in most texts should not be assumed to indicate an impersonal force. Although mi has usually been interpreted as an impersonal power, this would in fact be quite odd in ancient Near Eastern terms. It is possible that the inclination to interpret mi as an imper- sonal power stems partly from the fact that "the spirit of Yhwh" is thoroughly iden- tified with the deity in a way that angels are not, and that the existence of other spirits with agency and personal presence might therefore seem more problematic for monotheism than the existence of divine beings less closely associated with God. Not surprisingly, there is not a systematic presentation of these spirits in the biblical texts. In addition to the flexible form of the spirits, it is possible that we see both direct identification with God in some texts (TOI DTI^X mi [1 Samuel 16 and 18] and nsn mm mi [1 Samuel 19]) and a separate divine being in other texts. A spirit of falsehood may be envisioned in a variety of ways. What is evident, how- ever, is that even where there is variety of language (a spirit of deception or dis- tortion, and the like) and conception (explicitly personal or ambiguous), the function and result are consistent: Yhwh sends a spirit that brings deception to those already in the wrong, and this deception produces destructive justice. The tradition of a spirit of falsehood as an active part of the population of the heavens has not been recognized outside of 1 Kings 22 because of the ambiguous terminology: mi has been assumed to mean "inclination" or "feeling" in these texts, as it does in many others. However, one of the primary modes of communi- cation that Yhwh uses when delivering messages is the divine mi. With this prece- dent, we should not be surprised at a recurring tradition of Yhwh sending another mi with a related function. The use of a mi for the purpose of communication with humans can be understood to originate in the same domain of divine beings as the use of a This expression of divine message delivery stands fully within the scope of familiar biblical modes of divine-human communication. According to this recurring tradition, the mi of falsehood sent by Yhwh is recognizable by its distinct form and function as a deceiving messenger of the divine court.</page></plain_text>
