Barker Professor of Economics, Harvard University Metaphors doon offte gret greuaunce Neerly by The Monke of Bury THE FEW concrete examples the discussion of which constitutes the main purpose of the follow- ing modest reflections had best be approached by the detour of some introductory remarks. Science, any science means communication. Communication means language. The language of science can be mathematical or literary. Nei- ther language appears in an absolutely pure form. Mathematicians cannot avoid explaining at some point the meaning of their symbols in ordinary language. On the other hand, literary economists and sociologists often merely disguised their use of mathematical language, doing so at the cost of rigor and generality. But the conflict between the two modes of communication has been hardily perennial and probably will remain so forever, despite all the compromises that continually are being worked out between them. In this conflict, the literary scholar has been the aggressor. He feels that large areas of his subject matter are not accessible to mathematical treatment. His posi- tive judgments are often warped by normative in unctions. Sprecht nur von Energie emphatisch, Die Ethik ist nicht mathematisch, was aii old war cry of an anti-mathematician in which behind the assertion of fact stood syncretic- ally the deep conviction that ethics ought not to be mathematical. There stood, and still stands, the yearning for a world made both intelligible and acceptable by quality rather than by quantity. These feelings, of course, are not confined to schlolars. Novalis, the great poet of German ro- manticism, once expressed clearly-and, alas, beautifully-his hopes for a time Wenn nicht mehr Zahlen und Figuren Sind Schluessel aller Kreaturen; Wenn die so singen oder kuessen Mehr als die Tiefgelehrten wissen. . .. No scholar can wholeheartedly accept this Weltanschauung with its rejection, along with "numbers and curves" of all scholarship). And yet attitudes and emotions which are elements of this "world view" are still widespread indeed. In the field of my narrow professional interest the so-called "new economic history" has success- fully introduced the analytical models of economic theory and refined statistical methods into treat- ment of processes of long-term economic change. A great deal of protest against these innovations has been raised, particularly by the adepts of the entrepreneurial approach to economic history. It is true, that Novalis's "kisses and songs" remain unmentioned and the respective authors would not object to being regarded as Tiefgelehrte- profound erudites.1 But they do protest vigorously against what they call the "dehumanization of history," which they claim lies in the stress on quantity, on measure and weight,2 that is to say, in the failure to deal with man whose choices and 1 There is a direct line from Novalis to the sneering aphorism by Karl Kraus: "In a hollow head there is much space for erudition." Cf. Karl Kraus, .Sprueche und Widerspruteche (Munich, 1965), p. 90. 2 The ways of intellectual history are curious indeed. The entrepreneurial historians, whom none would de- scribe as anti-capitalistic, are fond, in this connection, of quoting Goethe's lines from Faust (II: 1, Kaiserliche Pfalz) in which Mephisto scorns the "quantitative" scholar: "Daran erkenn ich den gelehrten Herrn Was ihr nicht rechnet, glaubt ihr sei nicht wahr, Was ihr nicht waegt, hat fuer euch kein Gewicht." But it is the same quotation which one of the most in- teresting Marxian writers described as denoting "the whole essence of capitalism." Cf. Otto Bauer, "Das Weltbild des Kapitalismus" in: Eine Auswahl aus seinem Lebenswerk (Vienna, 1961), pp. 113-114. Or is it per- haps precisely the rejection of this "soulless" view of capi- talism that is one of the motivations lying behind the re- jection of quantitative approaches to economic history? Just one motivation, because almost surely along with WeltanscLau-ung (comprising abstract political views) there is also the problem of learning the language of mathematics, and there are the inveterate inhibitions that always discourage, and stand in the way of, attempts of mastering a new language. It is irrelevant that the new economic history with its rather elementary mathematics requires no more than learning the mere rudiments of the feared language. pROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 118, NO. 5, OCTOBER 1974 431</page><page sequence="2">432 ALEXANDER GERSCHENKRON [PROC.

It is probably useless and hopeless to point out that behind the allegedly "dehumanized" or "de- humanizing" diagrams, representing demand schedules, or possibility frontiers, or curves of income distribution stand very "human" things, such as valuations, aspirations, and expectations, as well as the distribution of abilities (be they innate or acquired) in a population, to say noth- ing of the benevolence of antecedents to their de- scendants. For whatever reasons, the under- lying philosophy is so deeply ingrained that ra- tional arguments are helpless against it. While there is no way in which man can be eliminated from social sciences, including history, in a different sense and at a different level there exists a specific problem of "humanization" as something that is indeed peculiar to literary lan- guage and is a source of both enlightenment and obscuration and as such a "dark light" to use the quaint figure of speech about which more will have to be said in conclusion of this paper. The concept of "humanization," narrowly conceived, may be used as one of the bridges that can be cast to the main theme of this paper. For it raises the problem of the use and abuse of literary language in social sciences and may even bear upon its intelligibility. Lichtenberg ( 1742-1797), the congenial con- temporary of Chamfort (1740-1794), once said: "The world is inclined to believe that, once one understands the language, one is able to read any book in which nothing is said of conic sections or of integrals. This, however is wrong." 3 Yes, it is, and rather obviously so. But the sharp-wit- ted professor of physics at Goettingen-in his days the leading German university-did not deal in truisms. He had something quite definite in mind. In his aphorisms, Lichtenberg touches time and again on the value and function of met- aphors.4 Here indeed lie some curious and trou- blesome problems of social sciences which are intimately related to clarity of meaning, validity, and methodological cleanliness. And these are specific problems of literary language, mathemat- ical language being blissfully free of them.5 3Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, Werke in einem Band (Hamburg 1967), p. 173.

Some of the metaphors in that language (such Figures of speech are the soul of the language. They are the language, as Quintilian recognized two thousand years ago, when he wrote that almost everything we say is a figure of speech." To a large extent, the enormous literature on the metaphor and the metaphoric-the terms broadly used, as already Aristotle did-is an elaboration of this ancient insight. Fritz Mauthner, the great non-academic thinker (Privatgelehrter), did not hesitate to say that "without exception every word in its individual usage is metaphorical" 7 and added "we have learnt to understand the metaphor as the term for the phenomenon which others call the growth or the development of language, . . . the history of language being an eternal chase after images :" 8 Mauthner continues by saying that as men who wish to say something new chase after images, it might appear as though the images themselves chased to conquer new ideas (Vor- stellungen) and concepts. But the new becomes a concept only after the conquest.9 It is worth noting that Mauthner's position in this respect is loudly echoed, though naturally without attri- bution, by Cohen and Nagel. These modern log- icians view metaphors as "expressing the vague and confused but primal perception of identity, which subsequent processes of discrimination transform into a conscious and expressed analogy as root or power) never gave any trouble. Quite the same cannot be said of negative and particularly of imagi- nary numbers, which produced what Whitehead called a succes de scandale because some people refused to under- stand that a technical term is a technical term (A. N. Whitehead, An Introduction to Mathematics [New York and London, 1948], p. 61). It is another matter that calling imaginary numbers clearly denotatively by the name of a mathematician would have avoided confusing people who perhaps deserved to be confused. Cf. also: Richard von Mises, Positivism, A Study in Human Understanding (Harvard University Press, 1951), p. 53. It might be added that the great Gauss, when complaining about the difficulties created by the term "imaginary numbers," suggested a different solution: quantitates lat- erales, thus proposing what still would have been a spatial metaphor, but one whose rather impenetrable metaphori- cal meaning hardly would have prevented the designation from being understood as a technical term and nothing else.

Perhaps less positivistic or rather pre-positiv- istic than Mauthner, the destroyer of metaphysics (but along with it also the destroyer of language as a tool of cognition), was Alfred Biese who regarded "human reason as being metaphoric in vision and thought." 11 But it was Biese who stressed the "humanization of the world of ob- jects" 12 and stressed as his guiding idea the basic compulsion of our whole spiritual existence to make ourselves the measure of all things-let us call it the anthropocentricity, that is to say, the compulsion to make what in itself is strange to us accessible and intelligible by reference to the only fully known, that is, to our own inner and outer life.13 AIuch, though not necessarily all, of what is said in the preceding references must be obvious to anyone who uses the language with a modicum of consciousness. Surely, analogy and compar- ison constitute one of the most important conti- nuities in the linguistic evolution. And beginning with Vico's una picciola favoletta-a concentrated fable or myth-the metaphor was time and again defined as an abridged comparison, "a comparison abridged in the form," 14 the "abridgment" lying in the fact that the act of comparison remains shrouded in silence, being as Blair said insinuated and not expressed. Surely, almost every look into a good dictionary convinces us that our ety- mology is thoroughly metaphoric. So are, there- fore, the lexical and idiomatic treasures upon which we draw daily in speaking and writing, except that most of those metaphors are not, or no longer, conceived as such. They are dead. Words borrowed from foreign languages may have entered our language already as dead meta- 10 Morris R.

Biese's sentences had to be somewhat rearranged in translation. 14 Hugh Blair, Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres (London, 1790) 1: pp, 372-373, phors, which expression itself is a well-worn, but not dead, metaphor. Some of these metaphors died, as often happens, and not only to words, in the very process of immigration. At any rate we are surrounded by metaphoric corpses. Nor- mally, they are quiet and give no trouble as befits corpses and the fact that we are hardly able to speak or write a sentence without using several dead metaphors does not bother us.15 We also continually create metaphors, giving rise to semantically new words which often promise con- siderable longevity, although the metaphor in them may die almost in the moment of creation. This is what happened to the noun "break-down" and to the verb "to spell out," both of which were invented by Washington civil servants in the course of World War II. But all those truisms do no more than adumbrate our problem. In fact, leaving aside Mauthner's negativism, much of the pertinent literature convincingly demon- strates the significance of metaphors in the for- mation of the language and in the processes of cognition. The modern statement that "meta- phors are not merely artificial devices for making discourse more vivid and poetical, but are also necessary means for the apprehension and com- munication of new ideas" 16 has been well pre- pared by nineteenth-century treatments. What is missing, however, in those treatments is the recognition not merely of the importance, but of the problematic character of the figure of speech as an instrument of understanding in social sci- ence, even though Biese's "humanization or an- thropocentricity" easily might have induced him to use these terms as a starting point for some further cogitations. That men see and try to understand the world as an extension of themselves does not at the first instance require much elaboration. The human body is something that is both most familiar and most important. Its structure, its functions and malfunctions, its changes over time, its growing, aging, and final obliteration have been observed for thousands of years. A lake is naturally said to have Five Fingers; a mountain is identified as Grand Teton (just as the Indians in what today is New Hampshire called two adjacent hills Un- 15 Here is Jespersen's example in which what he calls "the ex-metaphors" are in italics.

In some lan- guages the gender of objects is not necessarily neuter, but may refer to the basic biological di- chotomy of the race. That death is masculine in German and feminine in French or Russian may mean more than just its representation in myth, fairy tale, and poetry. More important is that even colloquial English deviates from the rule in its references to train or ship. In fact, for the American workman any object of work is femi- nine and the leaderman on an assembly platform in a shipyard, who wants a steel plate turned over, naturally orders his men to flop her. The women's liberation movement would have good reason to object to this usage. Work and its pro- cesses are indeed of crucial significance in the broad connection of "anthropocentricity." In a brilliant essay (which, however, remained no more than a sketch) Otto Bauer tried to pre- sent not only philosophical systems, but science and indirectly social science as a broadly meta- phoric extension of human work, "the man's pe- culiar form of struggle for life in the environment of nature," because "man is able to make all that happens (alles Geschehen) intelligible to himself only through an analogy to his own work." 17 One may wonder why work, conceived by Bauer as application of muscles (force) to objects (mat- ter) should be paramount in the minds of philos- ophers and scientists who in this sense were men of leisure rather than work. But this is not the point. The point rather is that even in this con- ception the "humanized" objects acquire a life of their own, give rise to new metaphors, which in turn create new metaphors. Even work, though involving the body, is not body itself, but an ema- nation thereof. When Bauer in discussing the origins and the evolution of modern science speaks of the transfer (a metaphor in its precise etymo- logical sense) of the man-made law of the abso- lutist monarchy to the laws of nature, governing the course of planets, and their return to man in the form of "laws" of social life and social evolu- tion he summarizes what Eucken had said quite a few years before him.18 17 Otto Bauer, op. cit., particularly pp. 104 and 110. 18 Cf. Rudolf Eucken, Die Grundbegriffe der Gegen- wart, Historisch und kritisch dargestellt (Leipzig, 1893), p. 173. Bauer's lack of attribution to Eucken is quite for- givable in a piece composed in the years 1915-1916 by a prisoner of war in the isolation of a Siberian camp near the Mongolian border. It is interesting in this connection to refer to the pro- tests raised by writers in the seventeenth century against The metaphors are still all there, but their "anthropocentricity" has been diminished in the process to the point of virtual disappearance. In the following I shall attempt to show that there may be significant differences in social sciences between metaphors, perhaps depending on the degree of anthropomorphism contained in them. Both constitute problems that deserve to be dis- cussed at greater length than has been the case. The positive features of the metaphor are hardly a problem. That it illustrates thought, aids in the comprehension of the new, and can give rise- to further thought has been mentioned in the preceding and may be regarded as common opin- ion. But even Quintilian expressed the hope that the truth that emerges from the figure of speech did not overwhelm the falsehood thereof.9- The problems, much less frequently treated, lie in the negative aspects.20 Of the latter the history of political science as well as of sociology provided examples that might have been elaborated a good deal more gener- ously by the author mentioned in the preceding footnote. The reference here is first to the so- the metaphoric extension of the concept of law (divine or human) to the inanimate processes of nature, describ- ing "the law of nature" as an "improper and figurative expression." The relevant references are given in: Hans Kelsen, Society and Nature, A Sociological Inquiry (London, 1946), pp. 382-383. It is noteworthy that Kelsen (whose main theme in this book is the connection of the idea of causality with that of retribution) in- sistently suggests substitution of the term "anthropocen- tricity" by "sociocentricity and of anthropomorphism" by "sociomorphism" (op. cit., pp. 263-264 and 376). It is safe to assume that neither Eucken nor Bauer would have objected to this terminological innovation. 19 "Utinamque non peiora vincant verum." Ibid. In. this connection, it does not signify that Quintilian's refer- ence here, as in the previous quotation, refers to very specific figures of speech. 20 Margaret Macdonald once expressed the intention. "to concentrate on the metaphors for I believe they are very important and have been very misleading" (cf. "The Philosopher's use of Analogy" in: Logic and Language, Anthony Flew, ed., p. 92). In this piece she does not refer, however, to social science, and when, in another- piece in the same volume, she does discuss metaphors in relation to political science ("The Language and Political Theory," op. cit., particularly pp. 175 and 183-184) she expresses no more than general wonderment about the meaning of an image describing "the state as organism"- an image of "general resemblance" than can be neither imaged nor pictured. But she quickly makes her peace with the problem by saying that "the use of certain images and metaphors" calls "attention in a very vivid way to, facts and experiences of whose existence we all know but which, for some reason, it seems important to emphasize"' (p. 184).</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 118, NO. 5, 19741 FIGURES OF SPEECH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 435 called organicist theory of state-probably the most far-reaching anthropomorphic construction that ever graced or disgraced pages that were scientific in intent and, alas, only too widely ac- cepted as such. The state was seen as an or- ganism-human or at times animal, and there was no "abridgment" about the mighty metaphor that appeared stuffed with numerous equally "un- abridged" sub-metaphors. With some represen- tatives of the theory (sit venia verbo) the meta- phoric frenzy knew no limits! "The telegraph and telephone wires can be justly [sic] described as the nerves of the state, because in the same fashion as the nerves in an organism they di- rectly connect the individual independent mem- bers and carry messages often over long distances. The telegraph and telephone offices are the gang- lions of the state. In the same way, roads, rail- roads, and canals with the relevant plant estab- lishments play a similar role as the lymphatic ves- sels in a corporeal organism. The individual in the organism is the cell ; in the state it is man.21 Some of these arbitrary and in fact wild analogies were rendered obsolete by technological process. With the advent and diffusion of radio, the talk about wires as nerves of the state lost all plausi- bility, although long before the post offices had defied the image of ganglions. At times, the comparison was "refined" by making it refer to the organism of only one sex. Helped no doubt by the gender of the words in Germanic and Romance languages, it was proclaimed that "the State is masculine in contrast with the feminine character of the Church." 22 Perhaps not sur- prisingly, the analogy was not pursued to any anatomic and physiologic depths. But the talk about the struggle for life, aging, and even repro- duction of the state was rife in a literature, the products of which as the previous citation shows were duly translated into foreign languages and published under respectable auspices.23 Like the state, society, too, was an organism and being an organism it was naturally exposed to diseases.24 A French organicist sociologist wrote as follows: 21 Oskar Hertwig, Der Staat als Organismus, Gedanken zur Entwicklung der Menschheit (Jena, 1922), pp. 54-55. 22 J. K. Bluntschli, The Theory of State (Oxford, 1892). 23 For bibliographic references cf. e.g., Georg Jellinek, Allgeineine Staatslehre (Berlin, 1921), pp. 148-157. 24 Paul de Lilienfeld, La pathologie sociale. Avec une preface de Rene Worms (Paris, 1896). Lilenfeld was a Balto-Russian. In the organism nervous tissues at times cease to function; fat then is stored in them causing them to become adipose tissues. Society, too, offers ex- amples of a similar histological degeneration. Groups of men who in certain periods had directed the whole nation, became, once they were gorged with honors and riches, prey to apathy and as a result fell into discredit. This in a couple of sentences is the whole history of the privileged of the ancien regime.25 Having thus explained by a metaphor the cause of the French Revolution, the author proceeds to discuss the ways in which the social organism "is susceptible to illnesses." Some of the mala- dies affect the organs of production. Strikes and involuntary unemployment are cases in point. They cause suffering to the individual, but this occurs because then he does not fulfill his social function. Other maladies affect the organs of circulation. It is in this way that certain customs tariffs arrest exports and imports. Then it can be the intellectual apparatus that suffers. "The cause of these maladies of the parts of body social in truth must be often sought in their struggles." 26 The last sentence is a give-away in more senses than one. The explanatory value of these con- structs in elucidating the nature of state and so- ciety is nil and fully on the same level as an "ex- planation" of a thunderstorm in terms of the sky first frowning, then being short-tempered and finally going into a rage. One is forcibly re- minded of the ancient story of a debate on God and life between two homespun philosophers, in which one of them finally announces his great dis- covery: "I think life is like a chain bridge," he says. His partner wonders: "Like a chain bridge? Why ?" "Who knows?" is the answer. Like an organism? Why? Who knows? One can understand and forgive when the young and naive hero of Thomas Mann's great novel in the spasm of his avid learning swallows the organicist theory of state hook, line, and 25 Rene Worms, Organisme et Societe' (Paris, 1896), p. 321. Lilienfeld managed to go even further in glorify- ing the power of the organicist theory in explaining his- tory: "Social pathology by discovering the natural laws which govern the development of all anomalies explain by the same token whole human history" (Paul de Lilien- feld, op. cit., p. 17. Italics supplied). This sounds rather extravagant, and it is, therefore, curious that Worms, despite his great admiration for Lilienfeld, felt that the latter had not gone far enough and in particular had failed to discover in society the counterpart of muscles, bones, and tendons in the human body.

SOC. sinker.27 But one remains amazed that profes- sorial chairs and scholarly reputations could be obtained and built up by this kind of theorizing. If the reason is that "anthropocentricity" consti- tutes the essence and the attractiveness of the metaphor and accounts for its strength, this type of metaphor also betrays the frailty of the human mind. Yet this is not a sufficient answer. Some- thing more specific is likely to be involved in this case. Aside from being destitute of explanatory force, the metaphors of the organicist theory of state and society limp throughout. Even Schaeffle who was not always averse to the approach and was willing to grant that "the comparison of the state with the animal body is not without value" went on to say that "the picture begins easily to limp on both feet."28 Should not the extreme arbitrariness and shakiness of the analogies have *deterred and disgusted the scholarly minded read- ers and given pause to the authors themselves? In fact, as far as concerns the latter the very opposite may have been true and the very weak- ness of the fundamental metaphor in all likelihood was regarded as its valuable contribution. The point, of course is, that, except in the realm of the fable, the members of a sound human body do not fight each other. In order to main- tain the metaphor alive, pathology had to be brought in and it is by no means an accident that Rene Worms in the previously quoted passage regards strikes and, in fact, any struggle as evi- dence of the illness of the body social. This then is the momentous meaning of an otherwise mean- ingless construct. Its actual thrust is not di- rected at explanations, but at something that has been an integral part of all theorizing about the state since its very inception, that is to say, the justification of the state. It was not the positive, but the normative aspect of the theory that was fundamental to it. The spirit of Menenius Agrippa was strong upon the organicist theory of state. The few lines in Plutarch 29 which 27 "The City, the State, the social community organized upon the principle of division of labor was not only com- parable to organic life, but repeated it." Cf. Thomas Mann, Der Zauberberg (Stockholm, 1946), p. 429. 28 A. Schaffle, Bau und Leben des sozialen Koerpers 2 (Tuebingen, 1896): p. 434. Schaeffle admitted having been for some time under the influence of Spencer and Lilienfeld, but then protested against being regarded as an "Orangniker der Soziologie." Cf. Albert C. Fr. Schaeffe, Abriss der Soziologie (Tuebingen, 1906), pp. 48-49. 29 Plutarch's Lives, Englished by Sir Thomas North (London, 1898) 3: p. 8. Shakespeare's genius has expanded so magnifi- cently could well stand as the motto over every volume of those metaphoric theories. The moral is clear. Just as there is natural harmony within the human body, and its absence either is fabled nonsense or illness, there must be harmony and absence of conflict within the state, lest it become sick, and, as everybody knows, sickness is a most undesirable phenomenon. And this is again the main problem of the large anthropocentric meta- phoric constructs, in which the metaphors, it should be noted, are very much alive. Purport- ing to explain what is, they actually aim at sug- gesting what ought to be. 30 In a sense, the shrewd Roman senator who did not fail to inform his unruly listeners that he was just telling them a story displayed an integrity not at all attained by the modern pseudo-scholars of the organicist theory of state. This theory is no more. In sociology, Oppen- heimer, in the 1920's, declared it to have been completely abandoned.3' In the profession of 30 With regard to the previously mentioned differential attribution of sex to state and church, Kelsen wrote as follows: "One would hardly err in suspecting behind this socio-biological sexual research nothing else but the po- litical demand that the relation between State and Church should be fashioned in a way corresponding to the traditional subordination of woman to man." Hans Kel- sen, Allgemeine Staatslehre (Berlin, 1925), p. 11. 31 Cf. Franz Oppenheimer, System der Soziologie, 1, Allgemeine Soziologie, Grundleguwg (Jena, 1922): p. 60 and 2, Der Staat (Jena, 1926): p. 208. Oppenheimer accused Herbert Spencer of having been responsible for the confusion and excesses of organicist theory. Despite all his predecessors, Spencer may indeed be regarded in some respects as the spiritus rector of the "organicists" of the last years of the nineteenth century. But Spencer's own position had come to be quite moder- ate. After having produced some metaphoric curiosities, he approached the subject of metaphor in the discipline in a most sophisticated way and remained interested not in a "figurative resemblance" but in a "fundamental paral- lelism" between biology and sociology regarding dif- ferentiation of functions and structures. Cf. Herbert Spencer, The Study of Sociology (New York, 1891), pp. 332-333. In view of Spencer's moderation it was natural to see Lilienfeld charging him with first stopping half- way on the road and then abandoning the "firm biological basis" altogether. (Paul von Lilienfeld, Zur Verteidi- guwg der orgacnische-n Methode in der Soziologie [Berlin, 1898], p. 27.) For the same reason, it is not implausible to hear it said that Spencer's theory of social organism had directly inspired Beatrice Webb, a scholar with a most non-figurative turn, of mind "to devote her life to scientific investigation of social institutions" (Kitty Mug- geridge and Ruth Allen, Beatrice Webb, A Life, 1858- 1943 [New York, 1968], pp. 38 and 78).</page><page sequence="7">VOL. 118, NO. 5, 1974] FIGURES OF SPEECH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 437 academic political science, Hans Kelsen's pure theory of law demolished it along with many other theories that were designed to present the au- thors' private desiderabilia in the guise of general scientific propositions.32 But the device that was incorporated in it did not die with it. It is still with us. The political thrust of the organicist state theory was clearly conservative. It is just as clear, however, that conservative thinkers pos- sess no monopoly over the use of the method that either borders on fraud or is that very thing. In our days, it is the radical writers, the sons and daughters of the leisure class, who, claiming to speak for "minorities, intellectuals, and students," not workers, it might be noted, decry the United States as a "sick society." 33 This indeed harks back to a theory that has been resting in peace and in pieces for about half a century. The pic- ture of illness comes directly from that very im- pure source, in both cases, the purpose of the metaphor being to give added weight to a political belief. What is being mobilized in the current case is the force of the Barbara syllogism: "All sickness is an evil; American society is sick; American society is evil." This ragout in which For the rest, even Rene Worms, who for such a long time had been the most radical, if not rabid, representa- tive of the organicist sociology, came to grow quite skep- tical of attempts as he put it, "to transform a scientific comparison into a metaphor pure et simple." For the expression of this disenchantment cf. Rene Worms, La sociologie, sa nature, son contenu, ses attaches (Paris, 1926), p. 52. Despite his negative position, Oppenheimer did speak of the "heuristic value" of the organicist metaphors, and so did others without ever providing any detailed elucida- tions, although intimating that what they had in mind was something less vague and general than, say, had Margaret MacDonald in her previously quoted remark on the subject. See above. Cf. e.g. Gottfried Salomon in: Die organische Staats- und Gesellschaftslehre, ein Nach- wort to Rene Worms, Soziologie (Karlsruhe, 1926), p. 121. Salomon's is a general defense of metaphors in scholarly thought, without any intimation that there may be both useful and useless, if not damaging, metaphors. 32 The Swedish political scientist Kjellen may perhaps be regarded as the last knight of the theory. But Kjellen who claimed that the view of the state as organism had persisted unimpaired since the days of Menenius Agrippa rejected what he called the hairsplitting (Wortklauberei) of the school and was mainly interested in the state's struggle for life and its birth and death, a concern per- haps not surprising in a work conceived shortly before and published in the midst of World War I. Cf. Rudolf Kjellen, Der Staat als Lebensform (Leipzig, 1917). 33 Cf. Michael Tanzer, The Sick Society, An Economic Examination (Chicago, New York, San Francisco, 1971), p. 216. a rhetorical figure and a logical figure are stewed together does not look too appetizing; yet it is doubtful that those who prepare such a dish and those who partake of it are fully conscious of the disabilities inherent in the metaphor. They would be hard put, if asked to elaborate their state- ments in more precise medical terms. What kind of sickness? Is it tuberculosis, syphilis, or leu- kemia the society is suffering from? No answer.34 Enemies of industrialization who in the nine- teenth century preached against the "cancer of the proletariat" were no less metaphorical and no more meaningful, but at least more specific. It is perhaps not surprising to see a metaphor of this sort seep into the language of the daily press. or into that of talkmasters on the radio. But it is discouraging indeed to listen to college pro- fessors gravely discussing the question whether the United States is or is not a "sick society," the scholarly training of the participants appar- ently providing no protection against dealing in undefined and probably undefinable terms. The conclusion that emerges from the forego- ing can be stated in a few words. The metaphors used made no contribution at all to the process of cognition. To liken the state to a man and the church to a woman was as enlightening for the nature of those institutions as the ancient sexual myth regarding the sun and the moon, with the medieval engravings showing the copulation of the two celestial bodies,35 enhanced the compre- hension of the astronomy involved. And what is true of the "big" metaphors used applied also to the many "sub-metaphors" within the larger metaphoric constructs. This was deplorable enough in itself. But the main problem with anthropocentric metaphors in social sciences is 34Lilienfeld tried indeed to provide an answer, and a fairly preposterous one at that: Economic, juridical, and political crises in society, he claimed, corresponded re- spectively to the following diseases of the human body: (1) dementia, (2) delirium, (3) paralysis (Paul de. Lilienfeld, La pathologie sociale [Paris, 1896], p. 55). But even Lilienfeld, despite his delight in analogical or homological fantasies, proved unable to develop these particular ones any further. And it was without the. least touch of self-irony that Lilienfeld later admitted that some analogies of certain Organiker had been formed too quickly and too superficially.

SOC. something else, to wit, the tendency to commingle, at times openly but mostly in an insiduously con- cealed manner, positive statement with normative precept and prescript, thus creating the unwar- ranted, highly misleading impression that the lat- ter are in some compelling fashion deducible from the former. This syncretism is indeed a sin against the very spirit of scholarship. Quintilian's hope that the benefit conferred by a figure of speech would exceed the damage inflicted by it certainly was blatantly frustrated in these cases. Other metaphors in social sciences present other problems. But by way of transition to dis- cussing them it may be in order to refer briefly to still another "anthropocentric" metaphor which suffers from other difficulties. The case, briefly stated, is as follows: Serious economic historians in discussing the economic development of Great Britain since the last quarter of the nineteenth century very frequently speak of the "cliinac- teric" of the British economy.36 The reference is to a period when England ceased being "the workshop of the world" and its rate of industrial growth, while still positive throughout, declined below the levels previously attained in the nine- teenth century. There were, of course, any num- ber of ways of describing, with all the desirable headlining brevity the change that took place at the time. But "climacteric ?" The menopause puts an end to the childbearing period in a woman's life. If the physiological metaphor was to be taken for what it means, the implication was that the productive period of England's economy came to some sort of irrevocable end. There was, and could be, no possibility of rejuve- nation. An implication of this sort, of course, belongs to the unknowables. But the intention behind the metaphor was never so far-reaching and actually rather innocuous. The purpose simply was to indicate by the use of a striking term that a momentous change had taken place in the economic life of England. Unlike the preceding cases, no normative deceit was intended and none perpetrated. If a sin was committed, it was against the requirement of precise termi- nology in scholarly usage. In fact, the metaphor as such was almost stillborn. Almost at once it became a technical term and as such a dead metaphor, comparable to other similarly lifeless 36 The term was first used by D. J. Coppock, in a much noted article: "The Climacteric of the 1890's: A Critical Note," Manchester School 24 (1956): p. 271. metaphors such as "body social" or "body poli- tic" which carry no insinuating, argumentative purposes. And yet, what is true of these particular cases need not be generally true. A deceased metaphor is not always quite like a dead body, safely tucked away six feet under the ground, and despite what has been said before, may give rise to problems. The literature about metaphors has produced a highly metaphoric typology. One reads of dis- colored metaphors, mechanized metaphors, pallid metaphors, dormant metaphors, diseased meta- phors, moribund metaphors, and one even is of- fered a distinction between dead and stone-dead metaphors. Fanciful and perhaps playful as these designations are, they do call attention to connec- tions and relations that can be serious indeed. And once the metaphoric impulses are aroused, one is led to wonder whether cure, awakening, revival, and even resurrection of metaphors is something that may occur in the scholarly usage of the language. As intimated before, becoming a technical term is supposed to kill the image in the expression. A true technical term is assumed to correspond to John Stuart Mill's "first principal requisite" of philosophical, that is, scholarly language, that is to say "to have a meaning steadily fixed and precisely determined," and as Mill repeatedly pointed out "no difficulty can be expected with technical terms created ad hoc by scientific in- quiries for the purposes of science and art." 37 Indeed, in economics, for instance, no problems arise in connection with technical terms of such type, such as "monopoly," "monopsony," "oli- gopoly," or "input," the completely artificial char- acter of the last term being emphasized by the failure of the "n" before "p" to be assimilated to "m" in defiance of the general phonetic rules of the language. It is another matter that a tech- nical term can be softened or diffused in its mean- ing when it is seized upon by what Mill liked to call "vulgar usage" (e.g., monopoly capitalism). At the same time, the language of economics bristles with technical terms from which the original pictorial connotation has been completely extirpated. In terms like depression, crisis, cycle, elasticity, investment, equilibrium, and numerous others, the metaphors are indeed "stone-dead." If the meaning of some of the terms used lacks 37John Stuart Mill, System of Logic (London, New York, Toronto, 1947), pp. 436-437 and 448.</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 118, NO. 5, 1974] FIGURES OF SPEECH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 439 absolute precision and the distinction between a depression and a recession may be somewhat vague and require a quantitative redefinition in a given empirical application, this difficulty has nothing to do with the figure of speech which is well hidden in the words. In economic history terms such as industrial revolution or price revo- lution are technical terms, which suffer from similar disability, because in them the "core area" is surrounded by a rather large "area of indeter- minacy." 38 But here the situation is somewhat different. The trouble partly derives from the terms being similes, as it were, of the second or even third degree. The etymological metaphor is gone. The semantic metaphor according to which, in the medieval literature, revolution was equivalent to cycle disappeared, too, a long time ago. What remained is the analogy to political revolution denoting rapid and pervasive change. These attributes leave plenty of room for the question as to what exactly is "rapid" and what is "pervasive," coupled with the unanswerable question whether, say, the change in industrial progress in England was as great as the political change in the French Revolution-unanswerable because of the lack of operational criteria of com- parison. Whenever the naive question is raised, "was the industrial revolution really a revolu- tion?" behind the query lies the desire to revive a metaphor that was or should have been killed by a precise definition of industrial revolution as a technical term. At the same time, a different but crucially important point is that being a metaphor, even though a derived one, may have lessened the need for a precise definition of the term. In a related but much more general way, it must be said that metaphors may be chosen because they produce the semblance of a scientifically precise term and disguise the absence of the latter. In the following presentation of specific cases both problems will be discussed, to wit, the re- vival of a metaphor and its pretended equivalence with something it is not. The metaphors in these cases will differ from those dealt with in the previous references to the organicist theory of state in not being anthropocentric. So do the metaphors mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Some of them, such as cycle, investment, and equilibrium originally derived from man-made things, but contained no references to structure 38 Richard von Mises, Positivism, A Study in Huma,n Understanding (Harvard University Press, 1951), p. 37. and function of the human body and even the connection with concrete objects created by man (ring, cloths, scale) is quite forgotten.39 They are abstract concepts. In the organicist theory of state the metaphor was deliberately stressed in accordance with the very essence of the theory. By contrast, in abstract concepts the metaphor is either dead or at best only subtly suggested.40 39 So much so that an economist visiting an investment- casting factory is quite baffled by the encounter with the familiar term in a sense which, though still metaphorical, has the smell of the tailor's shop about it, and surprisingly has nothing to do with a broker's office. 40 It is not suggested that abstract concepts are neces- sarily incompatible with anthropocentric metaphors. In some languages, especially in German and also in Rus- sian, unrestrained anthropomorphous behavior of abstracta is more than merely tolerated in the linguistic usage. Systems, concepts, ideas, attributes, and qualities of all kinds, to say nothing of institutions, are allowed to do almost everything a human being can do. In deference to the magnificent straightforwardness and clarity of the English language its users in general have scorned ex- travagancies of that sort. At times, English writers and speakers even preferred to be ungrammatical rather than anthropomorphous and to use phrases such as "the police are," "the government are," thus seeing clearly policemen and cabinet members behind a convenient shorthand ex- pression. Untranslatability, to be sure, is not just a lin- guistic, but a very broad social problem. But in the dif- ferent attitude toward abstract terms lies perhaps the main reason for which American and British translators *of German works in philosophy and social science have so often found their task very arduous and have devoted much ingenuity to attempts to guide German metonymic floods into orderly channels of intelligible and acceptable English phraseologies. It is possible that with regard to this problem American usage at times has been a bit less refractory than the British. At any rate, in recent years, in a rather Ger- manic way, terms such as society, culture, system, and a few others have been made to act as though they were humans. In this fashion, mythological entities are created and confused and confusing views of the social environ- ment are spread, curiously often by people who at the same time are inclined to deny the unity of those entities and to regard them as split into antagonistic groups with conflicting interests and ideas. This usage is perhaps less outrageous than, but well in line with, the almost unbelievable sins perpetrated in German anthropology by the use of terms such as Volksgeist or Volksseele. It was, however, a very great German sociologist who vig- orously protested against the mysticism of a "social soul" according to which mental processes (seelische Vor- gaenge) are claimed to occur outside the Seelen (souls) which cannot be anything else but individual souls (cf. Georg Simmel, Soziologie, Untersuchungen ueber die Formen der Vergesellschaftung, [Leipzig, 1908], "Exkurs ueber Sozialpsychologie," p. 557). "Uniformity in thought and action of many individuals creates the sem- blance of a social soul which is then regarded as the cause of that uniformity" (op. cit., p. 559).</page><page sequence="10">440 ALEXANDER GERSCHENKRON [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The materialistic conception of history offers at least one interesting illustration of the prob- lems involved. In this, in many ways grandiose, view, "productive forces" are associated with "production relations" that imply origin and ex- istence of classes with definite and conflicting eco- nomic interests. Such interests determine and explain the nature of seemingly non-economic phenomena, such as political and legal organiza- tion and events, as well as social, artistic, reli- gious, and philosophical values and ideas. This, of course, is not the place to discuss the manifold problems of the materialistic conception of his- tory.41 Nor is it of interest here to refer to the Simmel was not alone in taking this position. How- ever sharply Hans Kelsen may have criticized the con- cept of "interaction"-the carrying pillar of Simmel's sociology-the two thinkers certainly saw eye to eye on the danger of what Kelsen liked to call "metaphoric hypostatizations." On the subject of "social soul" (Massenseele) Kelsen even got into a mild argument with Freud, who denied Kelsen's charge that, dealing with Le Bon and McDougall, Freud had shifted his ground and came to admit the existence of a "mass soul" that was independent of the psyshic processes within individuals. It is curious that Kelsen, to my knowledge, never referred to his agreement with Simmel on a subject that was very important to Kelsen, who never tired of branding illicit personifications and revealing the hidden political purposes behind them. Cf. Hans Kelsen, Der soziologische und der juristische Staatsbegriff, (Tue- bingen, 1928), pp. 4-15, 21-22, 29-30, 134-135; same, "Der Begriff des Staates und die Sozialpsychologie, Mit besonderer Beruecksichtigung von Freuds Theorie der Masse; " Imago, 8, 2, (1922): pp. 111-113, 120-121; Sigmund Freud, Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analyse."

It should be noted finally that Simmel's and Kelsen's abhorrence of constructs in which creations of men acquire independent existence relates to Marx's very notable concept of "commodity fetishism." It is another matter that in Marxian writings categorized social entities regularly are made to act as though they were human beings and not metaphorically "abbreviated" fetish-like abstractions. Since in English (translations apart) these perversions of the spirit of the language and of clear meaning occur mostly at Mill's "vulgar" level and beneath that of the scholarly language, they are not directly relevant to the problems to be discussed here. But their penetration into the basically inhospitable climate of the English lan- guage does underline once more the strength of anthro- pomorphous propensities. 41 For the author's view of the subject the reader may be referred to Alexander Gerschenkron, "Macht oder oekonomisches Gesetz aus der Sicht der materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung," in: Macht oder oekonomisches Gesetz, Verein fuer Sozialpolitik, N. F., 74/I (Berlin, 1973). natural Germanic way in which the fundamental concepts used-productive forces, production re- lation, and classes-have been said to act and behave as humans, the classes in particular being endowed with thought, will, purposes, and senti- ments extending over the whole emotive gamut. Rather, the main point is the well-known refer- ence to Unterbacu and Ueberbau, that is, to in- frastructure and superstructure, the economy con- stituting the former and the non-economic social phenomena the latter. Since with one exception the extension and intension of the two concepts has been sufficiently clearly defined,42 the archi- tectonic comparison readily became a technical term, a useful shorthand in which the metaphor appeared dead. In fact, the metaphoric element was so far removed from consciousness that it was possible to speak of more or less gradual adjustments of the superstructure to changes in the infrastructure without any feeling that by doing so violence was being done to the image. It was perfectly meaningful and generally intelli- gible, therefore, to argue for instance that Schum- peter in his theory of imperialism had operated in true Marxian fashion with a time lag in the correspondence of "feudal superstructure" to "the capitalist infrastructure." The situation was clear enough. An interesting hypothesis had been formulated and in the process of presentation it was quite helpfully illustrated by a metaphoric likening of society to an edifice. This was in itself an altogether innocuous procedure, appar- ently destitute of substantive difficulties. And yet, there were still hidden potentialities and problems. In Soviet Russia, the materialistic conception of history has been regarded not as a hypothesis, but as a dogma.43 Accordingly, criti- cal examinations of the conception were treated as apostatic and accordingly condemned.44 42The problematic exception refers to the right of property, which may be seen either housed in the infra- structure among the production relations or in the su- perstructure with the legal system, thus constituting a bothersome ambiguity. 43The creators of the conception were not without original guilt in this respect, but in the last years of his life Friedrich Engels tried hard to stress the hypothetical character of the construct which alone could justify the self-proclaimed designation of the theory as "scientific so- cialism." Cf. on this A. Gerschenkron, loc. cit., pp. 334-335. 44 It is odd how much in the Soviet system has been borrowed from a source that one should have thought to be quite alien to it: hatred of sects and heresies, the use of the term "renegade," index librorum prohibitorum,</page><page sequence="11">VOL. 118, NO. 5, 1974] FIGURES OF SPEECH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 441 Such examinations have been rare indeed. But one of them, a thin ray of light, is relevant in the present context. Faced with the virtual im- possibility to explain a political structure in the history of Russia (the absolutist monarchy) by reducing it to economic conditions in the face of the opposing mass of generally known facts, a few Soviet historians, although with appropriate reservations and qualifications, introduced a new concept of "getting ahead."45 What was meant was that in some historical situations political change antedated the economic change, and that the former conditioned the latter.46 Even though presented in cautious and somewhat veiled lan- guage, the idea was clearly subversive of the materialistic conception of history conceived as a dogma, but not necessarily of the materialistic conception of history conceived as a hypothesis. For any scholarly hypothesis can and should be pushed to the limits of its applicability, a process in the course of which the hypothesis may indeed be damaged, but also may instead receive addi- tional strength. But it was not surprising that an orthodox protest was immediately vented against the novel views expressed. In a bitter and emo- tional attack, one Nechkina, a Soviet historian and member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, rose to accuse the innovators of "having lost the problem," the "problem" being precisely the ma- terialistic conception of history. And in the course of her remarks the irate lady said some- thing that bears directly on the subject of this paper. "Where," she asked, addressing herself to her opponents, "is the characterization of the excommunications, veneration of absolute authorities, and many others. Only the painful problem of theodicy was solved for the omnipotent government by the pre- creation of the devil of capitalism. It is amazing how prophetic was Thomas Mann in creating in his great novel the figure of Naphta, who in some respects repeats, or resembles, Anatole France's Abbe Lantaigne, who believed that la diversite est detestable and le caractere du mal est d'etre divers, and distinguished (as Naphta did) between human and divine astronomy (Anatole France, L'Orme du mail (Cercle du Bibliophile, Paris and Geneva, 1969), pp. 69 and 129). In general, The Magic Mountain is somewhat indebted to France's L'Histoire contemporaine and the brilliant Settembrini has a pale predecessor in the poor M. Bergeret. 45 Awkward in English, the concept in Russian is clearly and simply expressed by the noun operezhenie. 46 These views were expressed at the Third Meeting (in 1968) of Soviet and Italian historians in, Moscow. Cf. A. Gerschenkron, "Soviet Marxism and Absolutism," Slavic Review 30, 4 (December 1971): particularly pp. 861-863. infrastructure of the superstructure." In their description, she argued, the political system "hangs in the air." 47 The implication was clear! Was it not absurd to think of a house with attic and upper stories, but without the lower stories to say nothing of the foundations? One could not have a better exam- ple of a dead metaphor suddenly coming to life. Something that originally was intended to illus- trate the thought in a vivid manner, the illustra- tion then having been frozen into a shorthand sign, by one quick twist was transformed into an argument designed to support and substantiate the thought. The fallacy inherent in this proce- dure is obvious. Because it is nonsensical to con- ceive of a house suspended in a vacuum or of the foundation lying on top of the attic, it is also nonsensical to think of a society in which the po- litical structure antedates or determines the econ- omy. It is another matter that the fallacy reveals the basic weakness of the original metaphor in which a dynamic process was illustrated by a static image (to use accepted and stone-dead "mechanized" metaphors). It does not matter much in this connection that for this reason the revived or awakened metaphor provides rather poor support for the theory. But it might be noted that, unlike the case of anthropocentric metaphors, the normative element in this case is rather weak and confined to the tacitly suggested rather abstract inference that, because a well- constructed house is a more useful and better place to inhabit, the materialistic conception of history also has a stronger explanatory power than other hypotheses and interpretations. Still another problem emerging from meta- phoric usage can be gleaned from a related area of materialistic conception of history, although this particular problem will appear more clearly and also more painfully from the discussion of still another case. But the Marxian theory of state may well serve as as introduction and a transition. The basic character of that theory is not at all metaphoric in the same sense in which the organicist theory of state is, or rather was. To view the state as the executive committee of the bourgeoisie, as the instrument of the dominant class in order to assert its interests and to secure the subordination of the oppressed class, is meta- phoric only in the previously mentioned way of making abstract entities behave as humans. A much more specific problem arose when the hy- 47Ibid.</page><page sequence="12">442 ALEXANDER GERSCHENKRON [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. pothesis encased in the theory was confronted with the refractory historical reality of the absolut- ist monarchy. That form of government, existing and persisting in Europe for a couple of centuries and possessing indubitable strength and indepen- dence of its own, obviously could not be viewed in the same fashion as, say, the state of Great Britain in the middle of the nineteenth century, when it could be said with a fair degree of persuasiveness that the bourgeoisie and the gentry were fighting hard battles for and against the corn laws and, more generally, for the power in the state. To accommodate the absolutist monarchy with- in the framework, or at least at the margins, of the theory of state a modification was called for. Engels in an endlessly quoted passage tried to solve the difficulty as follows: He said: "Excep- tionally, however, there occur periods in which the warring classes are so nearly in equilibrium, that for a moment the state power, as a seeming mediator, obtains a certain independence towards both classes." 48 The substantive validity of this modification is of no interest for our purposes. Suffice it to mention that thereby only the origin of the absolutist monarchy and not its existence for a very long historical "moment" was reduced to class struggles and class interests as required by the theory. What alone is of interest is the concept of equilibrium. It certainly is a derived metaphor, the first origins of which (a German might say "Ur-Ursprung") lay in a man-made object, from where it moved to the general principles of me- chanics. But since Engels speaks of equilibrium of class power the likelihood is that at least in his thinking his metaphor derived from the bal- ance of power doctrine, which had penetrated into political thinking two or perhaps even three cen- turies earlier.49 In fact, there is conceptual affinity between the two concepts. In the seventeenth century, balance of power was defined as "such an adjustment of power among sovereign states that no single state is in a position to interfere with the independence of the rest." 50 The neg- 48 Friedrich Engels, Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigentums und des Staates in: Karl Marx- Friedrich Engels, Ausgewaehlte Schriften (Berlin, 1955) 2: p. 298. Italics supplied. 49 The Oxford English Dictionary 1: p. 631. 50 Ibid. For the importance of the equilibrium concept in foreign policies cf. Fritz Wagner, "Europa im Zeital- ter des Absolutismus und der Aufklaerung" in: Theodor Schieder, Handbuch der Europaeischens Geschichte 4 (Stuttgart, 1968): passim. Wagner believes that this ative character of that definition was reproduced in Engels's treatment of the term "equilibrium of power," according to which aristocracy and gentry were no longer strong enough to retain the power and the bourgeoisie not yet strong enough to ob- tain it. It was precisely in the same fashion that Otto Bauer attempted to apply Engels's concept of equilibrium of class power to the conditions of the Austrian republic in the years immediately following World War I and the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy. What changed were the classes involved, but this, too, came from Engels, who in explaining in the same terms the phe- nomenon of Bonapartism, also operated with bourgeoisie and proletariat. Again, Bauer's des- cription of the Austrian situation was negative, the bourgeoisie no longer and the proletariat not yet being strong enough to dominate the state.5 Despite the resemblance between the two con- cepts, there was a difference in the use of the metaphors involved. In the balance of power con- cept equality that essentially inheres in the idea of balance and in that of equilibrium was merely intimated and remained diffused as long as the previously quoted definition was not re-expressed in terms of alliances, that is to say, in terms of blocs of equal military power. By contrast, Engels's equilibrium contained the concept of equality rather expressly. No redefinition was necessary. In this sense the metaphor seemed to reproduce in social contexts the terminology of precise science, to which, directly or indirectly, it was related. The concept then was fully com- parable to the world of mechanics; as such it was a technical term, and the metaphor within it was destined to die. The difficulty, however, lay in the question in which way the respective "class powers" of the autocracy and the bourgeoisie could be measured and their pretended equality actually ascertained. Engels never attempted to concept of equilibrium spread from the area of foreign policy far beyond it into that of constitutional theory and even influenced the concept of preestablished har- mony in economics. For later discussion in this paper it may be noted that, despite having used the concept of equilibrium time and again with greatest freedom, Wagner suddenly stops to ask himself how such a con- cept could be expressed quantitatively (op. cit. p. 69). 51 Cf. Otto Bauer, Die oesterreichische Revolution (Vienna, 1923). pp. 243 et seq. Cf. also the earlier pre- sentation of the concept of equilibrium by Bauer in his parliamentary speeches in 1920 and 1922 in: Otto Bauer, Zum Wort gemeldet (Vienna, 1968), pp. 78 and 93-94.</page><page sequence="13">VOL. 118, NO. 5, 1974] FIGURES OF SPEECH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 443 do that but would have found the task arduous enough.52 Soviet scholars continued to use Engels's term with greatest de'sinvolture, completely unbothered by the problem of measurability. It was, there- fore, a novum indeed, when at the previously mentioned Soviet-Italian meeting one Soviet his- torian reminded his listeners in an incisive lan- guage that "equilibrium is not simply any odd relation; it is definite quantitative relation, and if such a relation is not given, words about equilib- rium are nothing but empty sound." 53 Those were courageous and rather destructive words. For the only answer that could have been given was not the presentation of a "definite quantita- tive relation," but abandonment of a concept that was revealed as "empty sound." What was de- stroyed was the false pretense that the metaphor was a precise technical term, and therefore, highly misleading. What the clear-minded and sharp- spoken critic did not say was that measurable equality, although essential in itself, was insuffi- cient to divest the concept of equilibrium of its metaphoric quality. These are the problems that must be dealt with in the discussion of the next case. The reference will be to the works of Talcott Parsons and his associates. Just as was true of the materialistic conception of history within the context of this paper, also the substantive validity of Parsonsian sociology, its merits and demerits, is not at all the subj ect matter of the following remarks. The only thing of interest is the use of metaphor, and of a specific one at that. Again, the concept of equilibrium constitutes the focus of the discussion. The difficulty is that here the con- cept appears within congeries of very special tech- nical terms; to explain the intended meaning of these terms would explode the scope of this paper and in all likelihood far exceed the potentialities of this writer. All that can be done is to indicate the meaning and character of the term equilibrium 52 It must be admitted that Otto Bauer in applying the term to a parliamentary democracy was in a somewhat better position, since he could use in support of the terms the votes received by the Socialist party and their opponents. He still had to add to the socialist deficit imponderable terms such as the power of industrial labor to influence the government by organized street demon- stration and/or general strike. These unmeasurable factors did introduce an impressionistic element into the allegedly precise quantitative term, but perhaps with- out transcending altogether the limits of plausibility. 53 Cf. Dokumenty Sovetsko-ital'yanskoy konferentsii istorikov, 8-10 aprelya 1968 goda (Moscow, 1970), p. 241. as it has been used in the relevant writings. The simplest way to do so is by presenting a number of quotations in which the term appears, letting them be followed by comments. "In any system we may discuss the conditions of equilibrium which are in the last analysis the conditions of the system being a system." 54 Since the subject matter of this sociology is the social system, the concept of equilibrium appears to be of crucial importance, and one is justified in expecting to be given a clear explanation of the concept. What then is this equilibrium? Appar- ently very many things. We are told: "Equilib- rium of drive gratification . . . operates within the context of an equilibrium of need dispositions and their systems." 55 Equilibrium within an equilibrium, like the to- pology of wheels within wheels, is bound to be a rather complex matter. Perhaps the overriding concept will clarify the matter, and so we have to ask what is the equilibrium of need disposi- tions? Again we are told: "The term need dis- position has been chosen to emphasize that in action the unit of motivation faces two ways. On the one hand, it is involved in the equilibrium of the actor as a personality (and organism) and on the other it is a disposition to act in relation to one or more objects." 56 Undeterred by the ap- pearance of still another equilibrium concept, and still quite in a haze, we look for a possible cue in the following statement: ". . . System of need disposition . . . is incipiently organized with respect to positive-negative discriminations; that is, it [the system] discriminates between need- gratifying the need-blocking, or need-depriving, aspects of the situational object system." 57 This orgy of difficult technical terms, which we may find "need-depriving," should not disturb us at all. All we are interested in is the concept of equilibrium. The passage just quoted is quite inexplicit, but perhaps one may infer from it that equilibrium of need disposition means a state of equality of need-gratifying and need-depriving aspects. Aspects is a very vague term, equilib- rium is a precise term, and the marriage of the two would be a less than perfectly natural union. Still, the inference, if correct, would at least tell 54 Talcott Parsons and Edward A. Shils, eds., Toward a General Theory of Action (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1952), p. 120.

SOC. us what is supposed to equal what in equilibrium. This would be something. But our surmise, which is not supported by any statement, is probably wrong because we are informed in another study that "theoretically, we tend to assume that a pre- ponderance of positive reactions over negative is a condition of equilibrium or maintenance of the steady state of the system," which system is then spoken of as a "stable, positively defined orbit," the term "orbit" adding a pleasant touch of meta- phorical precision to the matter.58 Thus, the equilibrium of need disposition does not seem to involve any equality at all, and one has to assume that, if equilibrium is spoken of in this connection, something very different from the normal concept of equilibrium is meant. So far we have been given three concepts of equilib- rium: (1) equilibrium of an actor as personality, (2) equilibrium of drive gratification, (3) equi- librium of need disposition. What is true of the last concept appears also to be true of the two others. With regard to them also it has not been explained what is supposed to equal what. If an answer to this question had been provided, we should have been driven to ask how the claimed equality of the variables involved could be de- termined. But in default of an answer to the former question, it is impossible to ask the latter one. Instead, we are receiving a different answer. We are told that the variables involved are inter- dependent and that their "interdependence is order. . . . This order must have a tendency to self-maintenance which is very generally [sic] ex- pressed in the concept of equilibrium.'59 Very generally indeed! The impression is that what is really meant is not equilibrium, but steadiness or stability, which is one of the possible meanings of the multifaceted concept of continuity. This impression is reinforced by what follows the pre- viously quoted sentence: It [the equilibrium] need not, however, be a static self-maintenance or a stable equilibrium. It may be an ordered process of change-a process following a determinate pattern rather than random variability relative to the starting point. This is called a mov- ing equilibrium, and is exemplified by growth.60 58Robert F. Bales, "The Equilibrium Problem in Small Groups," in: Talcott Parsons, Robert Bales, and Edward A.

The terms are obviously borrowed (without any strings attached) from economic theory where they are precisely defined and are, at least in prin- ciple, operational terms. But since no such defi- nitions and explanations are offered in the present case, it may well be that what is called moving equilibrium with the reference to growth in reality is just another concept of continuity,6' that is continuity not as stability tout court-as absence of change-but continuity as a constant rate of change; and this in the process of growth is per- fectly compatible with properly defined situations of both equilibrium and disequilibrium. But it seems that the authors discussed here are too strongly wedded to the use of the term "equilib- rium" to be willing to replace it by more suitable and appropriate ones. The following two quotations may shed some further light on the matter: In relatively stable systems of action there are then the two tendencies to build consistent systems of value orientation and the contrary tendency to gen- erate and tolerate inconsistent sub-systems with the strain they produce. There will be a delicate dy- namic equilibrium between the two maintained by a wide variety of accommodating mechanisms.62 And later it is said: The social system depends then on the extent to which it can keep the equilibrium of the personality system of its members from varying beyond certain limits. The social system's own equilibrium is itself made up of many subequilibria within and cutting across one another, with numerous personality sys- tems more or less in internal equilibrium, making up different equilibrated systems, such as kinship groups, social strata, churches, sects, economic enterprises, and governmental bodies. All enter into a huge moving equilibrium in which instabilities in the per- sonality or social sphere are communicated simul- taneously to both levels, either disequilibrating the larger system or part of it, until either a reequilibra- tion takes place or the total equilibrium changes its form.63 These quotations call for several remarks. The first quotation contains a novum. For the first time we are told of two opposing forces-the tendency toward consistency and the tendency 61 Alexander Gerschenkron, Continuity in History and Other Essays (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1968). 62 Towards a General Theory of Action, p. 175.

As one reads this passage and notes the reference to "different equili- brated systems," one also wonders whether what is meant by equilibrium is not simply the minimum conditions of social cohesion or existence.</page><page sequence="15">VOL. 118, NO. 5, 1974] FIGURES OF SPEECH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 445 toward inconsistency. We are not told, however, that the two tendencies must be equal in equilib- rium, although the latter term is worried a great deal. All we are told is that there will be a "delicate moving equilibrium" which in this case need not at all imply any equality. For it is per- fectly clear that if the "consistent tendencies" should prove much stronger and overwhelm the "inconsistent tendencies," the authors would be happy to describe the situation as being in equi- librium. Equality, therefore, is not a condition of this peculiar equilibrium, which is treated in terms of stabilities and instabilities.64 And the delicacy of the dynamic equilibrium, if it means anything, consists in the extreme delicacy, if not impossibility, of the task of defining with any conceptual clarity (never bothering about esti- mating the chance of empirical applicability) the strength of the relevant tendencies. The little in- terspersed phrases "more or less," "relatively sta- ble," "beyond certain limits" are entirely unspeci- fied. The suspicion remains that the "certain limits" are entirely uncertain, which is quite un- disturbing if the matter concerns stabilities and instabilities, described "very generally" in intui- tive terms, but is disturbing if the reference is to a precise term such as equilibrium. Even more disquieting is the reference to the "form of the total ['huge moving'] equilibrium." What is the form of such an equilibrium, which presumably must be distinguished from its substance? This remains entirely unexplained and the inappro- priateness of the two terms in relation to equi- librium again reinforces the impression that some- thing else than equilibrium must be meant. The same "certain uncertainty" plagues the reader when "a moving equilibrium" is described as one in which "certain orderly processes of em- pirical change are going on." 65 In this sentence nearly every word is intriguing, as one is told neither how to recognize that the "certain [?] processes" are orderly nor how "empirical change" is to be distinguished from "non-empirical change." A very indirect light on this question is possibly cast by the statement that "mainten- 64In view of the highly abstract way in which our authors treat their problems, it is probably irrelevant to refer to the well-known historical fact that men in social movements, and in certain conditions in whole societies, have found it perfectly possible to live for a very long time with glaringly inconsistent ideologies, the inconsis- tencies not producing any strains. 65 Talcott Parsons, The Social System, (Glencoe, Illinois, 1951), p. 481. Italics supplied. ance and alteration of equilibria . . . are defined as the empirically observed pattern constancies of a boundary-maintaining system."66 The latter term has been explained as follows: "The defini- tion of a system as boundary-maintaining is a way of saying that relative to its environ-ment . . . it maintains certain constancies of patterns whether this constancy be static or moving.67 Thus equilibrium comes to be defined in terms of pattern constancies. The difference between "stability" and "constancy" seems to be that the latter may "move" over time as would be true of a constant rate of growth. Again, the resem- blance between this concept of constancy and that of continuity suggests itself strongly but is not explained in the text. At any rate, instead of the looked for equality, one is offered constancy. The conclusion from the foregoing little antho- logy-or perhaps antilogy is-that the concept of equilibrium in it is essentially a figure of speech, a metaphor, although one of a rather unusual kind. Is it Vico's picciola favoletta? Is it Blair's "abridgment"? Yes, but in a somewhat different sense of an "abridgment" for the equilibrium mo- dels of economic theory, the fact of abridgment in a true metaphorical way being shrouded in silence and appearing intimated rather than ex- pressed. The difficulty is not that as such it is a metaphoric derivation of a rather high degree. The trouble is that what is called equilibrium in the present case actually is something else, such as steadiness, stability, order, constancy, by the the same token varying concepts of continuity.68 Equilibrium may indeed involve any of these 66 Op. cit., p. 483. Italics supplied. 67 Op. Cit., p. 482. The italicized phrase "relative to its environment" apparently means abstraction from "biological variabilities or those of the physical environ- ment" which are considered as exogenous to the system, although in a different study, quoted earlier, we heard of the "equilibrium of an actor as an organism." 68 In this connection the once famous book by E. A. Ross, Social Control, may be mentioned. Ross dealt indeed with the problem of maintaining and reestablish- ing the order of the social system. What he was pri- marily interested in were the strains imposed on social coherence by "sharp conflict of interest," "great contrast of means (wealth) ," and "inequality of opportunity" (Edward Alsworth Ross, Social Control [New York, 1920], p. 401). But Ross (who was not above occa- sionally using organicist terms and speaking, in connec- tion with class antagonism, of ill health and maladies of society) except for one reference to "equilibrating-appa- ratus" (ibid., p. 410) never spoke of equilibrium. It is, therefore, interesting that the modern editors of an abridged edition of Ross's works wrote in their intro-</page><page sequence="16">446 ALEXANDER GERSCHENKRON [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. things, but the connection does not work in the reverse direction, and in particular continuity is quite compatible with disequilibria. Nor is the concept of equilibrium designed to illustrate other- wise stated clear propositions, as was the case with the previously discussed Marxian infrastruc- ture-superstructure metaphor. If anything is to be "illustrated" by the use of the equilibrium metaphor, it is the idea that sociological theory can operate with the toolbox of the economic theory. In the case of the organicist theory of state, the metaphors used often had fairly clear normative aspects so that political views and goals could be justified with their help. In the present case one gets indeed the impression that the state of equilibrium is considered as a desirable one, but no specific normative conclusions are drawn. As a metaphor the status of the equilibrium concept or concepts in the present case is a rather special and an unhappy one. Because the con- cepts presented are so opaque and ill-defined, the metaphor cannot become a technical term. Ac- cordingly, like Eugene Sue's Juif errant, it can- not die, but its life must remain a sickly and an unpleasant one, deprived of the freshness and vividness that has made metaphors so attractive throughout the linguistic history in general. But returning once more to Quintilian's little balance sheet and his hope that the truth of a figure of speech would not prove smaller than its falsehood or that its usefulness would exceed its detriment, we must say that that hope has been deceived in the present case. For this particular metaphor has certainly been a very misleading one. It blandly suggested a conceptual precision that simply was not there, as was demonstrated by the duction to Part III of Social Control as follows: "A system which maintains its continuity and order even though it may be in the process of change, both in long term development and in momentary fluctuations. This is a concept of dynamic equilibrium" (Edgar F. Bogatta and Henry J. Meyer eds., Social Control and the Foun- dations of Sociology, Pioneer Contributions of Edward Alsworth Ross to the Study of Society [Boston, 1959], p. 113). Ross, who spoke of "static and dynamic epochs" (op. cit., p. 402), never used the term "dynamic equilib- rium." What is revealing for the point made in the text is that the editors expressly identify the term equilibrium with continuity and order. It is another matter that a situation in which no class is preponderant appeared to Ross as a very desirable state of affairs, but this is a very different concept which comes close to what has been said before of F. Engels and 0. Bauer with regard to the balance of class power. Cf. Leopold von Wiese, System der allgemeinen Soziologie (Munich and Leipzig, 1933), p. 336. Italics supplied. failure to deal with the concept of equality which is a necessary, although not a sufficient, condition of equilibrium. Even if the fundamental question regarding equality had been answered, there still would have been the long way to travel from equality to equilibrium 69 and the thorny problem of explaining the operational character of the con- cept in the specific sense of detailing what infor- mation would be necessary in order to make the concept potentially usable. For those who believe that concepts used in scholarly work must be presented strictly as what they are, without intimating non-existing preci- sion and without suggesting significant meanings allegedly lying beneath the veneer of verbal exer- cises, the case just treated must be very disturb- ing indeed. And one cannot help feeling deep regret that a comprehensive and ambitious socio- logical system, the erection of which had required so much thought and inventiveness, should be marred-and quite unnecessarily so-by the employment of unexplained and probably inexplic- able pseudo-scholarly concepts. It is true that somewhat similar usage pervades some colloquial language of scholars. A gradute student of eco- nomics thinks nothing of saying that for him the "opportunity cost" of reading a novel is high. This does not mean that he has made any cost calculations. All he means is that he would much rather read some other book or spend the evening with a girl friend. I once heard an economist justify his daily jogging as a "trade-off' between the daily loss of time to professional work and longevity. In such cases at least the suggested meaning is clear, but the suggested precision of quantitative terms used is entirely imaginary. But it is one thing to use highfalutin and slightly ridiculous talk in everyday conversation, and it 69 It is only fair to mention that even in economics there have been cases of some confusion in this respect. Aftalion, a notable French economist, who should have known better, and actually did, once claimed that "norm- ally the balance of payments is in equilibrium," meaning thereby simply the fact that in balance of payments statis- tics the two sides are presented as equal, because surplus or deficit of the balance of payments on current account is offset by deficit or surplus of the balance of payments on capital account, the latter appropriately increased or decreased by "errors and omissions." But while in a moment of aberration Aftalion confused the "man- made" statistical equality with economic equilibrium, he did not-and no economist could-divorce the concept of equilibrium from that of equality, as was done in the sociological literature discussed in the text (cf. Albert Aftalion, L'Aquilibre dans les relations economniques internationales [Paris, 1937], p. 9).</page><page sequence="17">VOL. 118, NO. 5, 19741 FIGURES OF SPEECH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 447 is another to be pretentious in this fashion in scholarly works which deal with subjects of great pith and moment. The general conclusion which emerges from these reflections and from the concrete cases discussed is that the use of figures of speech in social sciences is pregnant with serious problems. Metaphors have been used to make allegedly scientific, but in reality quite arbitrary normative inferences and in this way to impart-decep- tively-added weight to the often hidden political beliefs of the authors concerned. Metaphoric terms designed to illustrate a proposition or a hypothesis and performing this function innocu- ously as technical terms have been seen suddenly to awaken to independent life and to be used fallaciously to prove the hypothesis instead of merely clarifying and establishing its meaning. In another case, a rather vivid metaphor did mis- lead "by conveying the notion of complete likeness where only slight similarity existed." 70 In this way, far-reaching and rather misleading infer- ences were suggested, even though unintended by the inventor of this metaphor. In still another case, a metaphoric concept was employed and its meaning sufficiently clearly defined, but the way in which the concept could be rendered opera- tional was not discussed at all; presumably, it may be added, because in other areas, from which the metaphor had been derived, the concept was clearly operational. And, finally, a case was dis- cussed in which the metaphoric term used did not "have a meaning steadily fixed and precisely de- termined" and as such constituted a violation of what John Stuart Mill had called the "first prin- ciple requisite" of scholarly language.71 And 70 The quoted phrase is from Herbert Spencer, The Study of Sociology (New York, 1891), p. 330. 71 Vide sutpra. It should be in order to mention that the sloppy use of the term "equilibrium" in sociology is by no means peculiar to the works dealt with in the text. Take the case of Henri Lefebvre, who in discussing the peasant communities of the ancient world and the Middle Ages discovers no less than four different equi- libria, and finally waxes lyrical in the following passage: "On a level (de plain-pied) with nature, man was also on a level with himself, with his thought, with the forms of beauty, wisdom, folly, frenzy, and appeasement which he could reach. Within his reality, he lived and realized all his possibilities. Without profound disagree- ment with himself, he could abandon himself-in this magnificent equilibrium of the peasant community-to his spontaneous vitality. He did not let anything of himself, any energy, and instinct of his, lie waste." It is indeed odd to watch the way in which this French Marxian describes what Marx used to call the idiocy here again one would hardly go wrong in assert- ing that because the term was very precisely de- fined in other areas of scholarly endeavor, the metaphoric usage seemed-deceptively indeed-to permit avoidance of the search for unambiguous meaning and to justify the lack of clear defini- tions. Those are grave disabilities. There is no doubt that figures of speech can-and did-mislead and deceive by their very nature, sometimes by intent, most of the time because of sloppiness of both thought and language. It would seem that these disabilities have not yet aroused the serious crit- ical attention which they so richly deserve. A greater awareness of the problems involved would be very desirable. It has been the purpose of this paper to issue these warnings. It is hoped that they will be noted. But also the limits of their range must not escape the reader. For it is one thing to warn against misuse of figures of speech; it is another to condemn their use. Nothing said in the fore- going can be taken to deny the positive role of the metaphor in the process of scholarly cognition and explanation. Eloquent references to that role of rural life. This is not the language of a scholar; this is the language of an inspired poet or a prophet, and it would be altogether inappropriate to inquire into the possible precise meaning of the term equilibrium as used in the quoted passage. The "magnificent" vague- ness of the term alone precludes that. Presumably, be- hind the term and behind the whole lucubration stand the equally vague notions of alienation, the absence of which the quoted passage purports to emphasize. That historically seen, this is a pure fantasy-a golden-age dream-is irrelevant in this context. As far as the pre- viously mentioned four equilibria are concerned, it should be mentioned that, unlike the quotations in the text, Lefebvre at least uses the word "between" (e.g. "equilib- rium between individual activities and collective duties") but in these cases, too, the concept of equality appears to be absent from the mind of the writer and equilibrium then refers to uncertain, entirely unspecified, and chang- ing relationships (cf. Henri Lefebvre, Critique de la vie quotidienne, 1 [Paris, 1958]: pp. 219 and 221). That this playful use of inane metaphors can be infec- tious and harmful is shown by the fact that a fine scholar of great erudition and perception felt inclined at a certain point to bolster his very reasonable discus- sion of the Russian peasants' adherence to tradition and their resistance to change by gratuitous reference to, Lefebvre's equilibria-a very superfluous and annoying beauty blemish in a grand and glorious book (cf. Michael Confino, Systemes agraires. L'assolement triennal en Russie aux XVIII-XIX siecles [Mouton, 1969], pp. 335-336; also: Alexander Gerschenkron, "Non-sviluppo economico," Rivista Storica Italiana 84, 2 [1972]:) pp. 534-535).</page><page sequence="18">448 ALEXANDER GERSCHENKRON [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. have been cited in the introductory remarks. But like so many things we deal with, the metaphors also have two opposite aspects; and this is some- thing which perhaps is most clearly demonstrated by that curious figure of speech which regretfully appears on rare, but always noteworthy, occasions -the oxymoron. We turn rightly away in amused disgust from a contradiction in terms. There is nothing we could do with "wooden iron" or a "triangular ellipse." But Ovid's and Horace's concordia discors or Lucan's and Manilius's discordia concors-the unharmonious harmony-is a very different matter. Oxymoronic phrases such as "laborious idleness," or "retrogressive progress" (Charles Fourier), or "lonely crowd," or even "la complexification simplifjcatrice" of a French philosopher justly excite our imagination. They are thought-provoking and are highly sugges- tive of antinomies, dialectics, and ambivalences. Even so, one may speak of the "dark light" spread by metaphors in scholarly language, and should be conscious of the obligation to recognize the oxymoron for what it is, to appreciate its eluci- dating power, and to try to break asunder its antagonistic elements.</page></plain_text>
