<plain_text><page sequence="1">TIME AND THE HERO: THE MYTH OF NEMEAN i Nemean 1. 46-7 is a notoriously difficult passage: âyxo/iévoiç ôè XQ^voç 'pv%àç àjténvevaev /lehécùv âcparœv. Time caused the life to be breathed out of the (snakes') un- speakable limbs as they were being strangled. In 1962 Gerber took up again the defence of the manuscript reading xqóvoç against Roell and Hartman9 s emendation ßQO%oc, accepted by Bowra in the Oxford Text. Gerber pointed out, as had Hermann Fränkel, the active force which Pindar attributes to time1). More recently Vivante, following up Franke? s ap- proach, has stressed Pindar's tendency to conceive of time not in terms of a chronological sequence of days, months, or years, but in terms of the fulfilment and achievement which time brings (see especially O. 10. 5 1-9 and N. 4. 41-4) 2). Time, then, is the expression of a "mythical design" which is "laid over the time of nature. What stands out are signs showing the way to some crowning achievement"3). This view of time Vivante calls "mythical time". 1) D.E. Gerber, "What Time Can Do (Pindar, Nemean 1. 46-7), ТАРА 93 (1962) 30-33 who provides a survey of earlier scholarship; Her- mann Fränkel, "Die Zeitauffassung in der frühgriechischen Literatur," in Wege und Formen frühgriechischen Denkens (Munich i960) 10-11, who de- scribes chronos in N. 1. 69 as "der eigentliche Vollstrecker der Tötung" (10). Gildersleeve also favored the ms. reading: see CJ 49 (1953/4) 219: "Chro- nos is personification: Time has its hands."

Citing Gerber, he remarks in a footnote, "But conceiving time as a power akin to fate, Pindar may well express with it a meaning close to that of death"4). Yet time has, I believe, a more positive significance in Nemean i ; and both Gerber and Franke? s view of time as the expression of a vital energy and Vivante3 s notion of "mythical time" can substan- tially advance our understanding of N. i. 46-7. Neither scholar has seen the connection, observed long ago by Fennell5), between the "time" of 46 and the "time" which occurs near the end of the poem ròv änavra %qovov, 69a). This passage as we shall see not only confirms the reading %qóvoç in 46, but also casts light upon the dramatic and moral structure of the myth. The closing epode of the poem contains Teiresias3 pro- phecy of Heracles3 reward of immortality on Olympus (69a- 72b): avròv ¡nav èv eÌQrjvq ròv änavra %q6vov èv e%SQ(b r'av%iav xa/uarœv ¡lEyakodv noivàv Xayóvr èt-aÌQerov oXßioLc èv ôœ/Liaaiy ôeÇájbievov uaÀegàv "H- ßav äxoinv xaì yáfxov òaíaavra nàq Al K.QOvíòq&gt; ae/Livòv aìvrjaeiv vójliov. In peace for all of time uninterruptedly having as his lot serene calm in the blessed halls as the choice reward for his great efforts and receiving blooming Hebe as his wife and cele- brating his marriage feast beside Zeus son of Cronos, he will praise the solemn (Olympian) law. The eternity of time in this passage (ròv änavra %qóvov) is the fulfilment of what time accomplishes at the climax of the myth in 46. It reveals under the aspect of eternity the meaning of that earlier moment. It is the foreknowledge of Teiresias, "highest Zeus3 supreme seer of upright prophecy,33 (Aiòç 4) Ibid., p. 131, note 2. 5) C. A.M.

That earlier moment of "time" in 46 now appears in retrospect as emblematic of the hero's entire life: the encounter with terrible monsters full of destructive violence followed by success and joy. The event of 46-7 anticipates and is in turn fulfilled by the victories foretold by Teiresias in 62-8. In both cases Pindar stresses the overweening, violent nature of Heracles9 antagonists: (vßgiv xvœoaXœv 50b; ufJQaç ãiôçoôíxaç, 63 V His victory is a triumph of order over violence6). The pain- filled "time" of the hero's infancy which "strangles" the snakes is both prophetic of and, sub specie aeternitatis, coexistent with "the whole of time" in which he will enjoy peace and serene calm as the reward for his "great toils" (70-1). The moment of birth in which he "comes out into the wondrous brilliance . . . the son of Zeus" (uarjTàvêçaïyÀavnaïçAioç, 35) contains also the festive moment in which he celebrates his feast of marriage with "blooming Youth" beside Zeus. The parallels between the beginning and end of the myth underlined by the repetitions of "Zeus" and "time" (35 b and 72a; 46 and 69a) also account for one of the most puzzling fea- tures of the myth, namely the emphasis on the role of "golden- throned Hera ... queen of the gods" who sent the snakes (37- 40). Pindar, usually so careful about myths that tarnish the gods' morality, seems here to be extraordinarily unconcerned about divine responsibility. Hera's violently anthropomorphic passion stands out all the more disturbingly because of the contrast with her solemn attributes of exalted divinity: %qvooïïqovov (37) ůewv ßaaiXea (39) 7). Rosenmeyer, who has offered the most 6) The importance of 61-3 for the nature of Heracles' victories was noted by L. Dissen in August Boeckh, Pindari Opera Quae Supersunt 2. 2 (Leipzig 1 821) 360 ("ut iustae caedes significarentur"). See also J. Duche- min, Pindare, poète et prophète (Paris 1955) 175 -6, with note 1, p. 176; Bowra (above, note 1) 306, who suggests a connection between Chromius and Heracles on the basis of Chromius9 participations in the campaign against the Carthaginians in 480. A more extreme form of this view is doubted by S.L. Radt, "Pindars erste Nemeische Ode," Mnemosyne, Ser. 4, 19 (1966) 168-9 (The two snakes symbolize Carthaginians and Etruscans); but in Bowra' s milder, less exaggerated version it has some plausibility if one compares the implicit equation of Hieron's defeat of the Etruscans at Cumae with the god's defeat of Typhös: P. 1. 15-20 and 69-75. 7) Interpreters have tended to neglect the place of Hera in the Ode. So Duchemin (above, note 6) 99-100: "D'Héra le poète ne nous dirait à peu près rien, s'il ne se souvenait dans la I re Néméenne, que les serpents</page><page sequence="4">32 Charles Segal recent study of the ode, touches briefly on the problem8). He tries to resolve it by interpreting the myth as light and humo- rous9). Humorous touches there may be, as in the saffron colo- red diaper of 38 or the contrast between Alcmena, en chemise, and Amphitryon brandishing his mighty sword while the war- lords of Thebes, in full panoply (51a), back him up10). Yet the overall tone is one of high seriousness and solemn exultation. Pindar depicts a vivid pathos in Alcmena9 s "unbearable fear" (axXaxov ôéoç 48) which drives her to leave her bed of childbirth and rush in desperation for her new-born sons. Pindar's text offers an alternative, and, I believe, more satis- factory explanation for this contradictory picture of Hera in 37-40. He can dwell on her spite and hatred because they are cancelled out by the ultimate meaning of Heracles' life which in turn has its sanction from Zeus. It is as "the son of Zeus" (naïç Aióç, 35) that he comes into the light; and he will have the remarkable honor of celebrating his wedding feast "beside furent envoyés par elle auprès du berceau d'Héraclès"; J.H. Finley, Pindar and Aeschylus, Martin Classical Lectures 14 (Cambridge, Mass. 1955) 127: "The high colors are for the bright light of divinity," but divinity is less than bright in this ode. H. Herter, "Ein neues Türwunder," RhM 89 (1940) 157 observes that Theocritus was not altogether comfortable with Hera's role and changed her epithet from xQvgóuqovoç to noXviir'yiavo&lt;; {Idyll 24. 13). I do not, however, entirely agree with Herter that Pindar is entirely unself- conscious about Hera ("An Heras Verhalten Kritik zu üben liegt ihm so fern, daß er selbst ihren Todesboten eine Art Epiphanie zubilligt," 157). True, Pindar does not go out of his way to emphasize her, and her enmity to Heracles is given in the tradition (//. 19. 95-133 and cf. Pindar's àg^cuov kóyov 34b). Yet the effect of the epithets in 37 and 39 is striking. As stated below, I believe that Pindar does have another reason for calling attention to her divine dignity, namely because her action is itself part of a larger order and a larger view of divinity which emerges in the later part of the myth. 8) T.G. Rosenmeyer, "The Rookie: A Reading of Pindar Nemean 1, Calif. Studies in Classical Antiquity 2 (1969) 233-46, especially 244: "Given Pindar's reluctance to saddle the gods with misdemeanor, he is unlikely to have invented Hera's plot." 9) Ibid. y 242-6. 10; JNote too the contrast between the naked sword or the hero (52b) and the near-nude state of Alcmena, йлепкос (50). Pindar seems, in fact, to have worked out a closely symmetrical balance between the male and female sides of the episode. In each case he describes first the followers and then the chief character alone: ywaïxaç ... Soai ... over against avrà (49- 50); Kaô/Lieícov âyoi ... âêçóoi over against, 'AfÁyiTQvcov (51-2). A different, and more serious, view of the saffron colored swaddling clothes is proposed by G. Méautis, Pindare le Dorien (Neuchâtel 1962) 174.</page><page sequence="5">Time and the Hero: The Myth of Nemean i 33 Zeus" (лад Ai Kqovíòq, 72a). Zeus occurs six times in the ode, so often that Méautis has suggested that he forms a kind of spòra- gis or seal for the poem as a whole11). With Zeus in firm control the ultimate image of divinity remains unthreatened. Even Hera's cruelty is part of a larger plan, and hence she can receive the attributes of divinity because, despite her all too human foibles, she is part of an order which men still can and should respect. The very opening of the myth provides a strong reassur- ance that a larger plan is being fulfilled. The brilliance of He- racles' birth is not merely the light of life, like Homer's ôqãv (páoç y'eMoio or Lucretius' in luminis oras, but the brilliance of glory and lasting achievement. Aigla personified is one of the Graces, bestowers of immortality, and "Zeus-given aigla" marks the high point of a mortal life (P. 8. 96-7). Pindar's description of Heracles' birth effects a fine and significant contrast between his future immortality and the dangers and apparent weakness of his mortal condition (35-6): . . .

His status as "the son of Zeus" and his emergence "at once" (avrixa) into the "wondrous brilliance" (uarjràv êç aïyXav) con- trast with the more realistic, physical fact of birth: the mother's womb (literally "entrails", onláy%vá) and the hard travail (œôïva). Both the language and situation are similar to the birth of another glorious hero, Iamus : fjÀêev ó' vnò anMyxvœv vn œôïvoç т' êgarãç "lapoç êç (páoç avríxa. ròv ¡úv xvi£o[iêva ХеЫе %a¡iai òvo ôè yXavxœneç avràv òaifÀÓvcùv ßovÄaXoiv è&amp;Q£'pavTo òqáxovTeç...

CXVII, 1/2</page><page sequence="6">34 Charles Segal of Nemean i the miraculous, saving element is woven directly into the act of parturition itself. After the climax of the action and at the transitional point between Heracles' deed in the present moment (the xqóvoç of 46) and the prophecy of Teiresias which embraces "all time" (69a), Pindar restates the positive side of the gods' role. "Amphitryon saw the prodigious spirit and might of his son, and the immor- tals made to be unsaid the speech of the messengers" {nakiy- yXœaaov ôé oí â&amp;ávaroi ¡ àyyèXœv Qfjaiv ůéaav, 5 8-9) . Amphitryon' s summons to Teiresias, "surpassing prophet of highest Zeus" follows at once (60). The substitution oíãMvaroi (58) for Zeus makes this manifestation of the divine order seem even more solemn and mysterious. But who are these "messengers" ? Cer- tainly it is possible, as Finley suggests, that Pindar has merely left out a subordinate detail12). In the condensed lyrical style of the odes such a procedure is likely enough, and there are suffi- cient supporting characters in the background (Alcmena's wo- men in 49, the Theban nobles in 51a) to make it easy to think of other servants too. Theocritus developed this domestic side of the scene13). Yet Pindar's feeling for the mystery of divine action is far stronger and more serious than that of the Hellenistic poet14), and one may wonder if these "messengers" may not, in fact, be the messengers of Hera, the snakes whom she "sent" (Tts/LmSy 40). Their "swift jaws", grimly emphasized in 42-3, are to deliver a message not of words, but of death. On this view the "message" of the snakes would be directly cancelled by the speaking of Teiresias, as Hera's anthropomorphic ill will is can- celled by the remote purposes of the unnamed, generalized â&amp;á- varoi of 5816). Chronos, as the revealer of the mythical pattern behind events, can thus itself strangle the snakes and thereby unite Heracles' beginning with his end. The chronos which foils Hera's selfish and bitter revenge at the moment when the snakes expire 12) Finley (above, note 7) 127. Though Theocritus has a wealth of background personae (id. 24. 47-56), he omits this detail of the "messen- gers." 13) See especially Id. 24. 1-9, 35-53, 60-63. 14) See in general Herter (above, note 7) 152-3 ; Rosenmeyer (above, note 8) 242 if. 15; In a similar way iheocritus, who also emphasizes tne role ot Jtiera (Id. 24. 13-16), balances against her the omniscience of Zeus (Aiòç voéovroç čbzavra, 21); cf. also 29 and 68.</page><page sequence="7">Time and the Hero : The Myth of Nemean 1 35 is also the chronos which, in its widest extent as "all time", holds and fulfills Zeus5 plan. Heracles is himself a part of that plan, and hence at the end, at his wedding feast, can be said to "praise the solemn law" (ae/xvov aivr'aeiv vópov, 72b)16). His wedding feast is itself a sign of the fulfilment of that law: it both solem- nizes the reward for the defeat of lawless creatures, from the snakes to the Giants, and signals the capitulation of the recal- citrant individuality of a deity like Hera. In Pindar's conception of time, then, the moment of toil becomes transparent to the moment of celebration of immortal happiness; the act of the hero's birth already reaches ahead, in its aigla, to his marriage to the goddess of eternal youth17). The "time" in which his first victory over monsters is accomplished fuses with "all time" which fulfils and rewards his subsequent victories over monsters This festive banquet commemorating and rewarding noble achievement after hard toil also absorbs, in mythic time, and thereby transfigures the banquet celebrating Chromius' victory; Pindar, like Amphitryon and Alcmena, "stands" in wonder and admiration at the hall's doors (19-21): ëarav &lt;5' ên avXeíaiç &amp;vq(uç âvôçòç yiXol-eívov xaÀà /лекпо/леуос, evůa juoi âç/bióôiov òebtvov хеков [Л7]тш9 . . . I stood at the hall's doors of a hospitable man, singing lovely songs, where a well-ordered banquet has been arranged. With this scene we may compare the snakes at the "open doors of the chamber" (píx&amp;eioãv nvXãv ' êç ůaM/uov ¡ivyòv evQvv eßav, 41-2) Pindar's "standing" (19) also recalls Amphi- tryon who "stood mingled in wonder hard to bear and joyful" (ear a de uafißei òvoyÓQcp ¡ reqnvcú ¡leiyfieíç, 55-6; cf. neiyfòèvxay 16) The reading vójuov is virtually certain: see the scholia (1 12a Drach- mann). Wilamowitz, Pindaros (Berlin 1922) 256, note 1, declared categori- cally, "Wer in dem letzten Worte vó/liov verschmäht, das durch die Scholien in V gerettet ist ..., hat von dem Gedichte nichts verstanden." Farnell alone of modern editors dissents, reading vojuóv (The Works of Pindar ; Lon- don 1930-32, ad be). 17) For this aspect of time see Fränkel (above, note 1) 11 : "Nur Zu- kunft, die Gegenwart werden will und wird: das ist die Zeit." Note also the movement between "time" and "all time" in O. 2. 17 and 30 and P. 2. 57 and 46.</page><page sequence="8">36 Charles Segal 1 8a)18). The first parallel is all the more noteworthy because the doors receive special emphasis in the myth of Heracles. As Her- ter has pointed out, the doors partake of the eerie, supernatural aura surrounding the snakes and their approach19). The phrase ol%ïïeiaav nvMv describes the miraculous opening of the doors by themselves. There is another even closer parallel between Chromios and Heracles. In gnomic language which applies to the victor and the immediate situation Pindar declares that "one must battle in accord with one's nature treading straight roads" (25b): XQr¡ Ô' EV ev&amp;eíaiç óôotç oxdypvxa /¿aQvaafîai cpvã. In Teiresias' pronouncement of Heracles' future there stands a victory over "many a most hostile enemy, walking with crooked satiety" (64-6): xai riva avv nXayico âvÔQÕJV kÓqco areíxovra ròv ex&amp;QÓrarov (pãaê viv ôcboetv fiòcco20). Not only the repetition of areixovray but also the familiar contrast of the "straight" and the "crooked" invite the reader to connect the two passages21). Heracles is the ultimate model for a way of life which Pindar exhorts Chromius to follow22). Pindar addressing Chromius "at the door of his halls" (19) is also analogous to Teiresias addressing Amphitryon after the 1 8) The parallel was noted by Fr. Mezger, Pindars Siegeslieder (Leip- zig 1880) no. 19; Werter (above, note 7; 150-7: wenn (ťindar; einen soicnen Be- gleitumstand der Haupthandlung so ausdrücklich hervorhebt, so muß er auch ein besonderes Gewicht darauf gelegt und eine tiefere Bedeutung dar- in gefunden haben." Herter's view is accepted by Radt (above, note 6) p. 150, note 1. 20) The text is somewhat uncertain, but the general outlines are clear. I give the text of Bowra, who accepts the emendation of Beck (/¿OQœ for ¡подог). Wilamowitz defended the ms. reading (above, note 16, 496).

There is no justification for Radts9 view (above, note 6, 171) that the parallel (noted by him on p. 169) contains "eine Anspielung auf Chromios' Verleumder" in line 25.</page><page sequence="9">Time and the Hero: The Myth of Nemean i 37 latter "stood" amazed at his infant son's prowess (cf. ¿ora, 19; arra, 5 5). In both cases a present deed reaches beyond the imme- diate situation to larger and more general considerations of noble and meaningful action. The final and boldest correlation lies in the parallel between the "feast" of Chromius, whose "house" (ôó/ãoi&gt; 23) is hospitable to strangers and the feast of Zeus himself who receives Heracles "in his blessed house" (oXßioic êv òáfAaoi, 71) 23). The implication need not be only that Chromius5 Nemean victory is equivalent to Heracles' eternal bliss, but merely that effort and just action are rewarded - in time24). It was in such terms that Pindar introduced the myth, the hopes shared by men who toil much (32-3): xoivál yàg eq%ovt* èhtíòeç noXvnovœv âvôçœv. êyœ ô' 'HqomMoç ОУТЕурцаь 7ÍQ0(pQÓV0)Ç . . . Hopes too look to the future and need time for their fulfil- ment25). Chromius' nóvoi (33a) look ahead to Heracles' xa/Ltarœv [leyáXwv noivàv . . . eÇclíqetov (70). The "time" which can "stran- gle" threatening serpents and also hold the hero's eternal re- ward is also the time which can contain Chromius' Nemean vic- tory and the promise of higher victory, "the golden leaves of Olympia's olives" with which he will be "mingled" (jieix&amp;evtol, 1 8a; cf. fiEix&amp;eíç, 56, of Amphitryon). Time, chronos, thus contains two perspectives, presented in 46 and 69 respectively. This double perspective appears in an- other form in a myth like that oí Pythian 12, where the suffering of the vanquished monster is made to yield, at the level of divine action, beauty and joyful creation. There Athena transforms the mournful wail of the dying Medusa into a lovely song, "devising the all-sounding tune of flutes, that she might with her instru- ments imitate the plangent howl of grief that drew near to her 23) For the parallel see ibid, 167-8. 24; lhat the unity or the ode rests on a parallel between Heracles and Chromius has been recognized since Dissen (above, note 6) 357-8, though one must be careful about pushing the parallel too far. See Radt (above, note 6) 164ÍF. and Rosenmeyer (above, note 8) 241-2. 25) See Fränkel (above, note 1) 11, and the sentence quoted above, note 17. Rosenmeyer is surely right in interpreting these "hopes" as posi- tive and bright rather than negative (above, note 8) p. 241 with note 33.</page><page sequence="10">38 Charles Segal from Medusa's swift-moving cheeks" (P. 12. 18-21)26). So in Nemean 1 the "time" which "drove the breath of life from the snakes' unspeakable limbs" is but the dark side of time's fulfil- ment of the hero's happiness in his eternal union with his wife, Youth. The two perspectives come together in another way in the reactions of the spectators. The immediate, mortal onlooker, Amphitryon, arrives "smitten with the sharp blows of anguish" (ôÇeíaiç ãvíaioi rvjieíç, 53). The violence of his arrival (noXeov yv/uvòv nvaaaœv cpáayavov ' ïxer(o), 52Ь-з) slows down to the static, abrupt ear a (55). Yet even in his relief as he takes in the event he is still puzzled and stands in pain and joy both, amazed and uncomprehending (55-6): ear a ôè fia/ußei ôvacpoQœ reQnvœ re ¡leiyfieíq. Beyond him, at a higher level of understanding, are the prophet and his analogue in the "real" world, the poet. In at least two other passages Pindar associates his calling as a poet with the dignity and insight of the prophet: ¡uavreveo, Moïaa&gt; TiQocparevaco á' êyá. (frag. 137 Во = 150 Sn). êv Çauéœ ¡ле ôéi-cu XQÓvw âoLÔifiov ílteçíôcov nqocpárav. (Рае. 6. 5-6) 27). "Urging on the ancient tale" (34b) of Heracles' conquest of the serpents, Pindar is like Teiresias who "told" or "spoke" or "pronounced" Heracles' future deeds and future rewards («pgaCe, 61b; (pãae&gt; 66; evenev, 68). Pindar, in propria persona, exhorts the victor, a friend (20-3), to "fight treading straight roads" (25 b); Teiresias, addressing his "neighbor" (60) and fellow-citizen, prophesies how his son will destroy, fighting, "many a deadly enemy who walks in crooked satiety" (64-5). The prophet relat- ing Heracles' later fortunes mirrors Pindar himself reciting the "ancient tale" of Heracles' first exploit. But Teiresias, himself a figure of myth, has a purview far beyond that of the mortal poet 26) See E. Schlesinger, "Pindar, Pyth. 12," Hermes 96 (1968) 275-86, especially 283-5. 27; ьее Dowra ^aoove, note 1; 0; j.n.. uavison, г rom sircmiocnus to Pindar (London 1968) 295-7.</page><page sequence="11">Time and the Hero: The Myth of Nemean 1 39 and commands a broader view of time (69). Hence his vision takes in a higher stage of Heracles' life. Thus Pindar sets forth "a great praise (alvov) of storm-footed steeds" (6), whereas Tei- resias sets forth Heracles' praise of the divine law in eternal happiness on Olympus (aivrjaeiv, 72b)28). Yet poet and prophet both, by virtue of their breadth of view and their command of truth which extends beyond what the participants themselves can discern, behold the present deed, whether Heracles' or Chromius', as resplendent with its future fulfilment. They look beyond the chronos of the moment (46) to the cbronos which is the link between great moments (69), the junctures of a large design, the points where a hero realizes his q&gt;vá (25 b), where the gods fulfil their "law" (as/nvòv vópov, 72b), destroying those who practise hybris (50b) and know not dike (63). This is the Time which is the ultimate giver of fulfilment to men's aretai. As Frän- kel says, "Chronos ist das Verwirklichende: aus Hoffnungen und Gefahren, aus Möglichkeiten und Fähigkeiten macht er Wirklichkeit"29). In Nemean 1 Chronos unites the beginning of the myth, full of violent actions and violent emotions, with the end of the myth, pervaded by "peace" and high "serenity" (eÍQr¡vay f'ov%ía&gt; 69-70). On the one hand chronos denotes com- plete surrender to the circumstances of the moment, which yet contains the whole and simultaneously sets it in motion to- ward fulfilment; on the other hand chronos denotes the all-encom- passing fulfilment of the gods' design which is as complete in the moment as it is in eternity. Chronos not merely bridges the two perspectives, but is itself those perspectives. Brown University Providence, R.I.
