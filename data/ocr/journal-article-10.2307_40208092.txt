<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading "Sibylline Leaves": J. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas John R. Betz The great Hamann is a deep heaven full of telescopic stars, with many a nebula that no eye will resolve. - Jean Paul1 With his divinatory profundity [Hamann] stood alone in the litera- ture of his time, for which his peculiar religious orientation was already alienating and all the more inaccessible given that his sibyl- line leaves and hieroglyphic intimations are even more veiled in the dark raiment of symbolic allusions. - Friedrich Schlegel2 Though long overshadowed by the more familiar lights of the German En- lightenment, arguably no figure of the late eighteenth century exercised a profounder influence upon the intellectual giants of the early nineteenth century than the Konigsberg author and critic, Johann Georg Hamann (1730-88), otherwise known as the "Magus of the North." Given Ha- mann's current obscurity in the English-speaking world, and even in his native Germany, this claim may seem farfetched. Indeed, most will know of 1 Jean Paul, Vorschule der Asthetik, I, § 14, ed. Wolfhart Henckmann (Hamburg: Felix Meiner Verlag, 1990), 64.

In support of this claim, however, one need look no further than the testimony of Goethe, Hegel, Schelling, and Kierkegaard, all of whom regarded Hamann as a genius worthy of serious study. In fact, upon reading and studying his "sibylline leaves" (as they were commonly called), all of them in one way or another made claims to being his heir or interpreter - often enough as though their literary or philosophical credentials depended upon it. As even Kant recognized - in the capacity of a lifelong friend who famously tried and failed to win Ha- mann back to the cause and ideals of the Enlightenment - Hamann was an authority to be reckoned with. As Herder once confessed to Hamann, "Kant seems wholly retire with me! But of you he speaks with respect [Ach- tung]."* If this was true of Kant, it was all the more true of the intellectuals of the next generation, who were looking for a new start in philosophy and literature. To Goethe, for example, Hamann was nothing less than the "brightest mind of his day" and the "literary father" of the German peo- ple.4 To Hegel, who wrote a monograph-length review of the first edition of Hamann's works, Hamann was a genius and brilliant critic of the En- lightenment, whose Metacritique of the Purism of Reason heralded his own attempt to overcome the problematic dualisms of Kant philosophy.5 To Schelling, who discovered Hamann's writings at a critical juncture in his thought, Hamann was nothing less than a prophet and seer, who pointed the way towards Schilling's late "positive" philosophies of mythology and revelation. And, finally, to Kierkegaard, Hamann was not only "the great- est humorist in Christendom," which is to say, "the greatest humorist in the world,"6 but, together with Socrates, one of "the most brilliant minds 3 See Johann Georg Hamann, Briefwechsel, ed.

Hamann in the History of Ideas of all time."7 Such extraordinary testimony on the part of such celebrated poets and philosophers would seem to demand the attention of the student of the history of ideas - especially given that all of these figures, for all of their well-known differences, regarded Hamann as pointing the way for- ward, as a herald of ideas they themselves, in one form or another, would develop and bring to fruition. Indeed, for reasons I hope will become clear in what follows, the landscape of post-Enlightenment German intellectual life cannot be adequately appreciated or understood without him. But if this is really so, one might legitimately ask why it is that today so few, even in the modern academy, have heard of him. As I will attempt to explain in the first section below, this circumstance has largely to do with the peculiarities of Hamann's style, which have made him one of the most difficult - if not the most difficult - author in the history of German letters. As H. A. Salmony put it, "No work in the German language is as difficult to understand as every one of Hamann's writings."8 Hamann's contempo- raries were no less aware of the hermeneutical challenges posed by his writ- ings. As Lessing once put it to Herder, "I would not [presume] to understand [Hamann] in all respects; at least I would not be able to be sure whether I understood him. His writings seem to be tests of manhood for those who claim to be polyhistorians. They truly require a little knowledge of everything [Panhistorie]. A traveler is easily found; but one who strolls is hard to find."9 If Hamann was this difficult to understand even for some- one as learned as Lessing, it stands to reason that understanding him today will be no easier. Indeed, as Goethe observed, given the obscurity of Ha- mann's allusions - which typically presume an extensive knowledge of clas- sical and modern authors, the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, and an insider's familiarity with the intellectual debates of the eighteenth century - the difficulty of understanding him has only grown, and will continue to grow, with time.10 Herein, then, lies the chief reason for Hamann's present- day obscurity: his writings are so difficult that most have ignored him and eventually forgotten about him. 7 The Concept of Anxiety, ed. Reidar Thomte (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980), 198; JP 2: 1555. Indeed, no other modern author figures more prominently as a kind of model either for Kierkegaard's brand of Christian existentialism or for his experi- ments as a pseudonymous Christian humorist.

At this point, the reader may be in a better position to assess the richness of Hamann's thought and to appreciate his place in the history of ideas. For better or for worse, however, one cannot discuss Hamann's significance to the history of ideas without thereby conjuring up the specter of Isaiah Berlin, whose provocative monograph, The Magus of the North: /. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism, first published in 1993, did much to bring Hamann to the attention of a wider audience. Though Berlin's celebrity has certainly helped to resurrect Hamann from oblivion, this resurrection has also come at the price of a highly tendentious reading, a Procrustean genealogy (which ludicrously seeks to link Hamann to the rise of National Socialism), and, in general, a grotesque distortion of Hamann's views. Although Berlin is right to recognize Hamann's hostility to the Enlightenment, at least as far as its (in Hamann's view) idolatrous elevation of reason over revelation is concerned, his thesis regarding Ha- mann's supposed irrationalism is at best a caricature - drawn either from a limited knowledge of the sources or from a selective memory of them. As Hamann admonishingly put it to the more fideistic Jacobi, "Faith has need of reason , just as reason has need of faith."11 That is to say, for Hamann, as for the majority of the Christian tradition, neither faith nor reason can get along without the other: reason needs to be enlightened by faith (fides perficit rationem), without which it cannot sustain itself against skepticism, but faith, in turn, needs reason to understand what it believes (intellectus fidei). Admittedly, Hamann tended to stress the weakness of reason, which is rather understandable given his contemporaries' exaggeration of its pow- ers. He was, it seems fair to say, attempting to correct an imbalance. In no sense, however, can this be said to make him an "irrationalist" - any more than one could conceivably say the same of Thomas Aquinas. Nor is Ha- mann simply an "anti-Enlightener." Following Oswald Bayer, it would be far more accurate to say that he was a "radical Enlightener" - who in his twenty-seventh year experienced a genuine, life-transforming enlighten- ment by the Holy Spirit; who could subsequently regard the popular "En- lightenment" of his day (to which he previously subscribed) only as a cheap 11 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 7: 165. Hamann's emphasis. 96</page><page sequence="5">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas imitation; and who, therefore, in an effort to communicate real enlighten- ment, sought to give his contemporaries a much-needed "metacritical" bath, exposing what he perceived to be the blind spots, hypocrisies, uncriti- cal prejudices, and unquestioned dogmas of modern rationalism.12 All of which, even at a purely philosophical level, is wholly legitimate - unless reason is somehow exempt from any meta-critical investigation beyond the authorized self-critique of the Critique of Pure Reason. At the end of the day, therefore, Berlin's use of terms like "irrationalism" and "Counter-En- lightenment" should be recognized for what they are: expedient slogans for categorizing and peremptorily dismissing anyone who does not subscribe to the ideology of modern-day Aufkldrer such as himself. As a necessary antidote, therefore, the reader may wish to consult the more careful and considered works of James O'Flaherty (perhaps beginning with O'Flaher- ty's response to Berlin in the New York Review of Books) and Gwen Grif- fith-Dickson.13 The reader may also wish to consult Robert Norton's recent essay, in which he sets the record straight and exposes some of the problems with Berlin's scholarship.14 I. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS: THE NOTORIOUS DIFFICULTY OF HAMANN'S STYLE But if one has reason to be wary of Berlin's thesis, it is not altogether sur- prising; for Hamann's writings lend themselves rather easily to this kind of interpretation, and Berlin is by no means the first to have viewed Hamann in such terms. As Eckhard Schumacher notes, "from the first reviews in the 1760s to the literary histories of the nineteenth century to today's lexical entries, Hamann's texts have variously been characterized as the epitome of darkness, the paradigm of unintelligibility."15 For example, in reference 12 See Oswald Bayer, Zeitgenosse im Widerspruch: Johann Georg Hamann als radiklaer Aufkldrer (Munich: Piper Verlag, 1988). 13 James C.

In fact, Mendelssohn was initially so impressed by the Socratic Memorabilia, not- withstanding the oddities of Hamann's style, that he sought to recruit Ha- mann as a contributing editor for his journal.18 In the end, however, as in his review of Hamann's Crusades of the Philologist, even he is exasperated with Hamann's style, which he fairly describes as a "mishmash of satirical ravings, comical acrobatics, oblique allusions, overblown metaphors, and critical oracles interlarded with verses from Scripture, embellished with quotations from Latin and English, not to mention frequent footnotes to Plato, Bacon, Michaelis, Ausonius, Wachter, Holy Scripture, Petronius, Shakespeare, Young, Voltaire, and hundreds of others." Indeed, the net ef- fect of Hamann's style, he writes, is that "any reader looking for good sense is tempted to be maddened by impatience."19 Given such (on the whole) negative reviews, one would think that Ha- mann might have considered adopting a more popular style. Instead, he seems to have delighted in the public's perception of him. In his Clouds, for example, which was published in 1761 and is an anonymous response to reviews of the Socratic Memorabilia, he not only quotes the Hamburg re- view with approval, referring to himself (in the third person) as "unintelligi- ble," "dark," "cryptic," even "deranged," but compares his writing "to a Japanese or Chinese picture, in which one can perceive wild and dreadful figures, but whose significance no rational person can understand."20 16 From the Hamburgische Nachrichten aus dem Reiche der Gelehrsamkeit 57 (1760): 452. 17 Quoted in Schumacher, 89, from the Lexicon deutscher Dichter und Prosaisten, ed.

Hamann in the History of Ideas Clearly, Hamann did not mind giving the impression of being an irrational- ist. Nor does he give any indication that he could write any differently. As he once confessed to Herder: "Such crumpled, confusing and anomalous allegorical figures have become my element; without them I can neither breathe nor think."21 The newcomer to Hamann therefore has good reason to be per- plexed - and deterred. But it would be a mistake to conclude that Hamann was truly irrational. For him, "irrationalism" was a mask - one of many that he adopted for certain, ultimately evangelical reasons of his "author- ship."22 It would also be a mistake to conclude that he was simply a bad writer. As his confessional writings and earlier contributions to the weekly Daphne attest, he was perfectly capable of limpid prose. For that matter, as O'Flaherty points out, one must take stock of the fact that "scattered throughout his generally obscure prose are many succinct, epigrammatic, and very quotable expressions," as the existence of several popular collec- tions of Hamann's sayings attests.23 Above all, however, the thesis of Ha- mann's "irrationalism" and even the milder thesis that Hamann's writings are merely perversely impenetrable fail to explain why so many celebrated, impeccably "rational" German intellectuals of the next generation were fascinated by his writings, avidly collected them, pored over them as though they were oracles, and - fearing that the loss of these works would be tanta- mount to a cultural tragedy - made concerted efforts to publish them. As Jean Paul, impatient to hear news of the publication of Hamann's works, wrote to Jacobi in 1804: "What will happen with Hamann? - Say some- thing definite! I can see everything die - for it will come again - but not a genius."24 It was not that these intellectuals failed to recognize the darkness of 21 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 3:38. 22 Cf. 2 Cor. 5:13. As he tells Kant and Berens in the dedication to his Socratic Memora- bilia (Hamann, SW, 2: 61): "Where a common reader might see nothing but mold, the affect of friendship, gentlemen, might help you to discover a little microscopic forest in these pages." In other words, Hamann is happy to appear inscrutable, offensive - even mad - to those who are ill-disposed to his message. Those who are sympathetic, however, will discover something sublime (in this case a profound spiritual message) clothed in a humble and initially alienating form. As such, the logic of Hamann's style is essentially Christological. Cf. Hamann, SW, 2: 171. 23 O'Flaherty, Johann Georg Hamann, 100. As Jean Paul put it to Friedrich Schlegel, "I read a sentence [of Hamann] and put it away and then have enough eggs to brood over in my mind." See Jean Paul, Sdmtliche Werke, ed. Eduard Berend (Berlin: Akademie Ver- lag, 1952), 6:258. 24 Jean Paul, Sdmtliche Werke, 6: 274. 99</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 Hamann's style. Rather, it was precisely in the darkness that they discov- ered powerful and strangely beautiful communications, hidden like gems in a mine or "suns in patches of nebula" (to use Jean Paul's image), which made the effort of reading him worthwhile. As Matthias Claudius described it, ". . . he has wrapped himself in a midnight robe, but the golden little stars shining from it here and there betray him, and allure, so that one does not regret the effort [required to understand him]."25 Goethe, too, appreciated Hamann's novelty in this regard.26 In a lengthy discussion of Hamann's style in Dichtung und Wahrheit, he writes: In order to achieve the impossible he lays hold of all elements: the profoundest, most mysterious perceptions, where nature and spirit meet in secret; illuminating lightning flashes of understanding, which beam forth from such an encounter; images laden with sig- nificance suspended in these regions; provocative sayings from sa- cred and profane authors; and whatever else might be added in the way of humor [ - ] all of this constitutes the wonderful totality of his style, his communications. ... In my collection I have some pages of printed text where in his own hand he cited the passages to which his allusions refer. If one looks them up, they again give off a double light, which appears highly agreeable, though one must completely forego what is ordinarily called understanding. For this reason as well such leaves deserve to be called sibylline, because one cannot treat them in and of themselves, but must wait for an opportunity when one might perchance have recourse to their oracles. Every time one opens them, one believes to find something new, given that the meaning inhabiting ever passage touches us and excites us in a manifold way.27 One can see why Goethe admiringly described Hamann to Charlotte von Stein as "cette tete unique."28 He speaks of experiencing in the midst of 25 Claudius, Sdmtliche Werke, ed. Jost Perfahl (Munich: Winkler, 1968), 23. 26 Referring to one of Hamann's own maxims, he says, "Clarity is a proper distribution of light and shadow," and adds the words, "note well!" See Maximen und Reflexionen, in Werke, 12:412; cf. Hamann, Briefwechsel, 6:235. 27 Werke, 9:515. 28 See Werke (Weimar, 1890), 6:359f.: "J'ai toujours aime beaucoup les feuilles Sybillines [sic] de ce mage moderne et cette nouvelle production II y a des bons mots impaiables, et des tournures tres serieuses qui m'ont fait rire presque a chaque page. . . .

" 100</page><page sequence="9">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas darkness (within, as it were, the painful difficulty of Hamann's texts) "illu- minating lighting flashes of understanding" - recalling Hamann's own image of "monosyllabic lightning" and the corresponding suggestion that this is the sublime effect great poetry is meant to achieve.29 What Goethe fails to mention, however, though it is doubtless the most important key to Hamann's authorship, is that his style is above all a function of his self- understanding as a Christian author and, specifically, of his mimetic witness to the Word of God: the Johannine Logos which "shines in the darkness" (Jn 1:5), the "prophetic word," which similarly "shines in a dark place" (2 Pet. 1:19), and the Word of the Cross, whose "folly" initially defies rational comprehension but nevertheless contains and conveys the wisdom and power of God (1 Cor. l:18ff.). Accordingly, to understand Hamann's style, one must ultimately go back to the conversion and the attendant theology that inspired it - a con- version that left him deeply and permanently impressed with the folly of divine revelation and its inscrutability to the "wise and learned" (cf. Mt. 11:25); a conversion, moreover, that highlighted for him the ironic contrast between real enlightenment, which the "darkness" cannot comprehend (cf. Jn 1:5), and the pseudo-enlightenment of his age, which, knowing nothing of the interior illumination of the Holy Spirit (cf. Acts 19:2), was really darkness. Instead, therefore, of purveying "clear and distinct ideas" as urged by modern philosophy, which, following Descartes, tends to recog- nize truth only in the very limited domain of what it can clearly grasp, he intentionally confronted his readers with "darkness" and "folly." But he did so ultimately as a metacriticus bonae spei in the "good hope" (cf. 2 Thess. 2:16-17) of conveying true enlightenment, which comes by way of Socratic ignorance, by way of humility, and a corresponding recognition that there are some things, like the mysteries of the Christian faith, that lie beyond reason's grasp. As he put it in a late elucidation of his authorship, summarizing his self-understanding vis-a-vis the Aufkldrer, "Non fwnum ex fulgore, sed ex fwno dare LUCEM."30 In other words, whereas his con- 29 Hamann, SW, 2:208. In this regard there is ample evidence to suggest that Hamann introduced into German letters an intentionally "sublime style": firstly, given his knowl- edge of Longinus; secondly, on a modern view of the sublime, in view of the "pleasure within the pain," the "light within the darkness," his writings afforded; and thirdly, given the striking parallels between his own style and the sublime style Lowth attributed to the Hebrew Bible in his Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews (1753) - a style characterized by elevated themes, a proliferation of symbolic figures, gnomic allusions, darkness, terseness, and vehemence of expression. 30 Hamann, SW, 3: 347. From Horace, Ars Poetica: "Not smoke from lightning, but from smoke to give LIGHT." 101</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 temporaries sought to give light directly - in a way immediately intelligible to all persons at all times, according to the dictates of reason, univocally understood - in Hamann's view they produced merely smoke and darkness. He, on the other hand, sought to perplex, to confound reason's pride, in order to make room for the light of faith (cf. Ps. 119: 130). For, as Hamann believed and had experienced, it is in this light that one truly begins to see (Ps. 36: 9). II. HAMANN, KANT, AND HERDER While Hamann's influence upon German literature was immediate and pro- found, having entered the literary mainstream by way of the Sturm und Drang, his influence upon the history of philosophy was more indirect and mediated chiefly through Herder and Jacobi. However, there is one signifi- cant exception to this, which is often overlooked, namely, that Hamann was almost certainly the first to acquaint Kant with Hume and thus to facilitate Kant's famous "awakening" from his "dogmatic slumbers." Con- sider, for example, Hamann's remark to the pre-critical Kant in the summer of 1759: "The Attic philosopher Hume has faith necessary if he should [merely] eat an egg and drink a glass of water."31 In the same letter he also adduces a quotation from Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Under- standing on the miraculous quality of faith and the insufficiency of reason to attain to it - adding that he has to arm the "feeble eyes" of his reason with the glasses of an "aesthetic imagination."32 Whatever Kant made of such remarks at this time one can only guess. But given Hamann's role in introducing Hume's skeptical assessment of reason's limits into German thought - including Hamann's partial translations of the Treatise of Human Nature in 1771 and the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion in 1780, both of which we know Kant to have read and appreciated - Hamann must be recognized as an important, if little known influence on the critical turn in Kant's philosophy.33 Of perhaps greater importance to the history of ideas, however, is Ha- 31 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 1:379. 32 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 1:380.

See Hamann, SW, 4: 364-70. 102</page><page sequence="11">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas mann's role as the first significant critic of Kant's mature, critical philoso- phy. In fact, not only was Hamann the first person to read and write a review of the Critique of Pure Reason - the proofs for which he had surrep- titiously acquired from the publisher - but his Metakritik fiber den Fur- istnum der Vernunft (1784) remains to this day perhaps the most incisive critique of the Critique.34 Though it is impossible here to analyze Hamann's Metakritik in any detail, suffice it to say that its most salient feature is the attention Hamann draws to language and tradition as the impure historical matrix - the real a priori - of reason, thereby contradicting and calling into question Kant's claims to the transcendental purity and validity of his inves- tigations. In other words, for Hamann, contra Kant, not only is reason bound to language and tradition; it is in some sense a product of language and tradition and therefore cannot be artificially severed from them. More- over, in Hamann's view, Kant's attempt to do so is ultimately a hypocritical ruse serving a prior political agenda: the attempt to wrest reason free from tradition for the sake of a critique of tradition. The impact of Hamann's criticism was delayed, however, due to his friendship with Kant and his reluctance to publish either the review or the Metakritik during his lifetime. And so it was through Herder, to whom Hamann first communicated the Metakritik, that Hamann's critique of Kant first made its way into the philosophical mainstream - with many of the same criticisms of Kant being brought to bear in Herder's own Metak- ritik zur Kritik der reinen Vernunft, which was published in 1799. That Herder adopts Hamann's views, especially on the importance of language, as well as Hamann's negative assessment of where Kant's critical philoso- phy ultimately leads, is obvious - so much so that the following year Fried- rich Theodor Rink, a Konigsberg Kantian, published Hamann's Metakritik precisely in order to charge Herder with plagiarism.35 III. SCHELLING AND JACOBI: A DEBATE ABOUT HAMANN If Herder is to be credited with furthering Hamann's metacritical ideas on reason, language, and history, the more fideistic strands of Hamann's 34 See my review essay, "Enlightenment Revisited: Hamann as the First and Best Critic of Kant's Philosophy," Modern Theology 20 (2004): 291-301.

In fact, one could argue that Herder and Jacobi represent the same two very different aspects of Hamann's thought that were later picked up and developed, respectively, by Hegel and Kierkegaard. It was also through Jacobi (as the executor of Hamann's Nachlass) that Hamann came to the attention of Schelling. It would seem that Jacobi and Schelling first met in Munich in 1806, when Jacobi was serving as the president of the Academy of the Sciences and Schelling was one of its prominent members. Not long thereafter Jacobi provided Schelling with a rare collection of Hamann's writings. Hamann evidently left a deep impression on Schelling, and it was not long before Schelling began referring to Hamann in his work. The following year, for example, Schelling refers to the "profound" Hamann in an address to the Academy entitled, On the Relationship of the Plastic Arts to Nature in which he adduces a modified quotation from the Aesthetica in nuce.36 Moreover, Schelling thanks Jacobi for having acquainted him "with the writings of this powerful and original mind [urkrdftigen Geistes]" express- ing his wish that Jacobi will either undertake the long-awaited publication of Hamann's works himself or at least promote this endeavor by word of mouth. The edition of Hamann's writings was long in coming, however, and in the meantime, over the course of 1808, Jacobi provided Schelling with an additional collection of Hamann's letters. Schelling was delighted, and thanked Jacobi in a letter dated 5 January, 1809, writing: "I owe it to you that I have come to understand more about this wise man [Magus] and prophet than I ever would have been able to learn on the basis of his writ- ings alone."37 The timing of this remark is significant; for it was in this same year that Schelling published his Philosophical Investigations on the Essence of Human Freedom, which is arguably the watershed text in his philosophy.

The context of the citation is a discussion of the aesthetic theory of the Enlightenment and, in particu- lar, the classical prescription that art should imitate nature. Following Hamann, Schelling asks what it could possibly mean to imitate nature once it has been robbed of all vitality, so that nothing is left but an empty formal structure: "Your lying philosophy has cleared nature out of the way; why then do you demand that we imitate it?" 37 See F.W.J.

Hamann in the History of Ideas juncture, it is quite possible that Hamann's writings helped to bring about a renewal in his reflections, particularly inasmuch as they turned more clearly in later years to such Christian theologoumena as creation, revela- tion, and the Trinity. In any case, Hamann would seem to occupy a place no less important in Schelling's late philosophy than did Jacob Bohme and Franz von Baader. In his On the Essence of the German Sciences (1811), for example, Schelling speaks of Hamann in connection with Bohme as one of a great "cloud of witnesses," a "man of penetrating spirit . . . who felt more profoundly than any other the death of nature at the hands of abstrac- tions, and the great vanity of his age with its presumed superiority and dominion over nature, and its moral enmity toward the same."38 Although Hamann, an orthodox Lutheran, would almost certainly have balked at any association with the Gnostic Bohme,39 Schelling's com- parison of them indicates how he read Hamann: namely, as providing the germinal insights of a system that he would develop. The first place one sees this is in the Freiheitsschrift, where at one point Schelling appeals to Hamann in emphasizing the dignity of the passions against the Stoic ten- dency of the rationalists to denigrate them, i.e., to see them either as some- thing alien to reason or as something merely to be vanquished by it.40 Schelling also follows Hamann in criticizing the God of modern philoso- phy - a God who far from being living and active, able to initiate some- thing, is a mere "idea" of reason (as with Kant) or merely the "result" of reason's historical process (as with Hegel).41 He follows Hamann, further- more, in affirming the legitimacy of anthropomorphic language for God, and does so, again following Hamann, on the basis of divine condescen- sion, which is the defining aspect of Hamann's vision of reality.42 The most important insight that Schelling picked up from Hamann, however - since it fundamentally defines the path of Schelling's late philosophy and his cor- responding critique of Hegel - is that the work of creation, like any work of artistic genius, is a profound revelation and in no way reducible to the terms of reason or logic alone. In sum, following Hamann, Schelling came to see nature and history not as a reflection of what reason always already knows a priori, which, in Schelling's terminology, is a merely "negative" 38 SW 1/8:8. 39 See Hamann, Briefwechsel, 1:307. 40 Schelling here adduces a quote from Hamann's Aesthetica (Hamann, SW, 2:208). 41 See SW 11/3:172. 42SeeSWI/8:167ff.;181ff. 105</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 kind of knowledge, but as a "positive" revelation in shadows and mysteries (increasing in clarity from paganism to Judaism to Christianity) of a God who exceeds reason's grasp.43 If Jacobi and Schelling had been on friendly terms up to this point, this suddenly changed in 1811 with the publication of Jacobi's polemical tract Von den Gottlichen Dingen und ihrer Offenbarung. Although Jacobi no- where mentions Schelling by name, his references to the "second daughter of the critical philosophy" leave little room for doubt that it is Schelling (after Fichte) that he has in mind; and though the charge of atheism is nowhere stated directly, Jacobi's identification of Schelling with the "new Spinozism" again leaves no doubt as to his meaning. Why Jacobi decided to attack Schelling at this point is unclear. But whatever his grievance, Ja- cobi makes his case against Schelling in part by appealing to Hamann's authority, thus making the interpretation of Hamann an unlikely but im- portant aspect of their debate.44 Schelling's response to Jacobi in his Denk- mal der Schrift von den gottlichen Dingen is scathing.45 Not only does he expose "the grand inquisitor" as a fraud (at one point Jacobi had added words to a quotation from Schelling that made Schelling appear to be an atheist), eventually forcing Jacobi's resignation from the Academy of the Sciences; he also robs Jacobi of his cherished status as Hamann's friend and interpreter, suggesting that Jacobi never understood Hamann in the first place. The first time Schelling mentions Hamann in the Denkmal is in defense of his own philosophy, which Jacobi had somewhat ineptly attacked for asserting a temporal priority of nature over spirit, darkness over light, etc. Just as Jacobi had invoked Hamann's Aesthetica in nuce in order to criticize Schelling, so now Schelling invokes Hamann's Cloverleaf of Hellenistic Let- ters in his own defense: "The external creation, says J. G. Hamann, is a work of the greatest humility; the spiritual doctors are unanimous in their view of creation as an act of condescension."46 Schelling then goes on to ridicule Jacobi's abstract theism, saying: "That views of this kind are not 43 See Schelling, Grundlegung der Positiven Philosophic, ed. Horst Fuhrmans (Turin: Bot- tega D'Erasmo, 1972), 222; 99. 44 See Jacobi, Von den Gottlichen Dingen und ihrer Offenbarung (Leipzig: Gerhard Fleischer dem Jiineern, 1811), 70: 97-100. {Author: Confirm author of book! 45 See SW 1/8:19-136. 46 SW 1/8:71. Schelling would seem to be drawing upon Hamann in support of his own speculative doctrine that God the Father, the first potency ( = A1), in Schelling's terminol- ogy, condescends to make himself the ground of the creature, which exists, in turn, for the sake of the second potency of the Son ( = A2). 106</page><page sequence="15">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas for people who take an eternally completed and therefore truly lifeless God for granted, is understandable, and in this respect there is no more to say than that they should content themselves with everyday conceptions and should not mix in the business of philosophy."47 While Hamann would scarcely have subscribed to Schelling's Gnostic narrative of divine becom- ing or found a theogonic process necessary to redeem the notion of a "liv- ing" God (in this matter he most certainly would have sided with Jacobi), neither would he have subscribed to Jacobi's essentially ahistorical theism which is insensible to the breadth and depth of history as revelation (in this matter he stands closer to Schelling). As Schelling sharply put it to Jacobi, calling into question his understanding both of Hamann and of Christianity itself: What can Christianity be for you, with all its physical, sensible, its, as you say, bodily proofs} It is too real, too massive for you; yet without it Christianity itself is nothing - this empty foam skimmed from the outer surface of the most up-to-date religion of reason, this so-called theism, which subtracts everything natural from God, for which the physical expressions of Scripture, indeed, the physical aspect of [Christianity's] entire doctrine and institution, cannot be anything but folly. . . . The great J. G. Hamann, from whom you were able to pluck a few pinions, at most to write with, but not to fly, says, "The knowledge of nature and history are the two pillars of the true religion. Unbelief and superstition are based upon an insipid physics and an insipid history."48 One sees here how much better Schelling understood Hamann than did Jacobi - at least with regard to Christianity as an historical religion rooted in revelation and not in unmediated subjective feeling. After comparing quotations from Hamann and Jacobi, which further reveal the discrepancy between Hamann's and Jacobi's views, Schelling then delivers the coup de grace: "But, of course, how could one be able to understand the words of the departed, who could not comprehend the voice of the living!"49 After again challenging Jacobi's understanding of Hamann's ideas, particularly regarding Socratic ignorance, Schelling asks in a footnote, "m what sense, if at all, Herr Jacobi understood this great author?"50 47 Ibid., 72. 48 Ibid., 113f. 49 Ibid., 115. 50 Ibid., 125. 107</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 The last time that Schelling discussed Hamann at length was in his lectures On the History of Modern Philosophy (1833-34), long after Ja- cobi's death in 1819. Here again the context is a polemical treatment of Jacobi in a section provocatively entitled "Der Theosophismus."51 On the one hand, Schelling commends Jacobi for his early, fiercely held intuitions of human freedom and personality, which set him against the rational sys- tems that sought to exclude them; for these were, after all, the same intu- itions that contributed to the development of Schelling's own philosophy. On the other hand, Schelling claims that Jacobi eventually lapsed into the same, purely rational religion that he initially opposed, and thus departed from the views of two men he highly esteemed: Pascal and Hamann.52 In an encomium to Hamann, Schelling then alerts his readers to the first edi- tion of Hamann's writings and to the great difficulty of interpreting them: [ . . . Hamann's] writings, which were once scattered abroad like sibylline leaves and difficult to acquire, have now been gathered together in a collection that is without question the most impor- tant literary enrichment of recent time. I say this not with the in- tention of recommending them to you. A manifold erudition is required to understand their numerous allusions; deeper experi- ence to grasp the whole of their meaning. They are not reading material for youths but for men, writings which one should never set aside, which one should continually regard as a touchstone of one's understanding - Hamann, whom Jacobi judged to be a true pa'n of harmony and discord, light and darkness, spiritualism and materialism. Hamann had no system, nor did he propose one; yet whoever could claim to be conscious of a whole, which would unite all of Hamann's statements, the measured and the apparently unmeasured, the most liberal and, on the other hand, the crassly orthodox, would be able to say that he had attained to some mea- sure of insight, inasmuch as a human being can imagine to under- stand anything at all. Philosophy is truly a profound science, a work of great experience; people without experience in matters of the spirit, mere mechanics, are here beyond the scope of their judgment - even if they are free to make a judgment on Hamann and to exhibit their own nature [in the process]. . . .53 51SWI/10:165ff. 52 Ibid., 170. 53 Ibid., 171. 108</page><page sequence="17">Betz ♦ /. G. Hatnann in the History of Ideas Given the context of these remarks, Schelling clearly meant to discredit Jacobi's reading of Hamann - or at least to suggest that Jacobi was not up to the task of interpreting him. It is equally clear, however, that he meant to discredit his other nemesis, Hegel, who only five years earlier, in his review of the first edition of Hamann's writings, presumed to have provided a definitive interpretation of his life and work. Instead, Schelling suggests that in their readings of Hamann both Jacobi and Hegel came away merely with a confirmation of their own prejudices. IV. HEGEL'S REVIEW OF THE FIRST EDITION The long-awaited first edition of Hamann's writings, Hamanns Schriften, edited by Friedrich Roth, a friend of Jacobi and a fellow member of the Academy of the Sciences, was finally published in seven volumes between 1821 and 1827. One can gauge something of its cultural significance from the fact that in 1828 Hegel wrote an extensive review, roughly seventy-five pages in length, which was published in two parts in the Jahrbiicher fiir wissenschaftliche Kritik.54 At the outset of his review, Hegel boldly pro- poses finally to dispel some of the darkness and the mystery surrounding the "Magus" and to give the public a long-awaited explanation of his life and works. But the language of his review also suggests a more personal motivation, namely, to investigate more carefully and critically a figure whose intellectual and spiritual authority - at least in the eyes of Herder and Jacobi - de facto called Hegel's own into question: Herder and especially Jacobi (leaving aside Goethe's . . . thorough appraisal) spoke of him . . . and appealed to him as one who was destined to come, who was in complete possession of the myster- ies, of which their own revelations were simply a reflected glory. ... A nimbus thus spread out around the Magus from the North - which had become a kind of sobriquet for Hamann. This was in keeping with the fact that he expressed himself in his writings only in a fragmentary and sibylline manner and that the individual writ- ings one did get hold of only made one curious about the rest, hoping that they would shed some light [on the others]. With this 54 G. W. F. Hegel, "Hamanns Schriften," in Werke, ed. E. Moldenhauer and K. M. Michel (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1986), 11:275-352. See Lisa Marie Anderson, Hegel on Hamann (Chicago: Northwestern University Press, 2008). 109</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 edition of his works now in our possession, we are able to see who Hamann was and what kind of wisdom and knowledge [Wissen- schaft] he possessed.55 The first thing that Hegel notes about Hamann is his passionate oppo- sition to the abstract rationality of the Enlightenment; and, not surprisingly, in keeping with his own philosophy, Hegel reads Hamann as a manifesta- tion of the dialectical return of Geist from the jejune abstractions of Wolffian metaphysics to the concrete particularity of historical existence.56 Hegel also notes, and rightly so, that Hamann's protest against the Enlight- enment stems from his faith: "Hamann," he says, "stands opposed to the Berlin Enlightenment, first of all, on account of the profundity of his Chris- tian orthodoxy. . . ."57 What Hegel especially appreciates about Hamann in this regard is that he takes his bearings from the doctrine of the Trinity and the objectivity of historical revelation; and so Hegel naturally enlists him as an ally in his critique of Schleiermacher and of the trend toward subjectiv- ism in theology, toward a so-called Gefiihlstheologie: Hamann was well aware of the objective context of the reconcilia- tion he came to feel in his own soul, which is none other than the Christian doctrine of the Trinity of God. The contrast could not be more stark between Hamann's faith, the Lutheran faith, indeed, the Christian faith as such and the professional theologians of today, who claim to be devoted to the Christian doctrine of recon- ciliation and at the same time deny that the doctrine of the Trinity is its basis; without this objective basis the doctrine can have only a subjective sense. In Hamann it stands firm. . . ,58 There are, then, clear lines of continuity between Hamann and Hegel. In this regard one should especially recall Hamann's emphasis, contra Kant, on the history and genealogy of reason. It is also significant that Hegel follows Hamann in understanding creation and history in terms of a divine kenosis. Indeed, in light of this doctrine, the broader significance Hamann 55 Hegel, Werfce, 11:277. 56 Ibid., 279f. 57 Ibid., 280. 58 Ibid., 315. As Hamann put it in a letter to Herder, which Hegel goes on to cite, "it seems to me that without the so-called mystery of the Holy Trinity it is utterly impossible to give any instruction in Christianity; the beginning and the end would fall away.' " See Hamann, Briefwechsel, 3:349. 110</page><page sequence="19">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas gave to it, and the way that it enabled both Schelling and Hegel to reconcile reason with nature and history, one could argue that Hamann stands in the background of the whole of German idealism. At the end of the day, however, whatever influence Hamann may have had on Hegel - be it direct or indirect - Hegel's opinion of him was rather mixed. On the one hand, he admires Hamann's originality: "Hamann was not only himself original, but even more so an original. . . ."59 In particular, Hegel appreciated the way that Hamann responded to the "purisms" of Kant's philosophy: "It is wonderful to see how in Hamann the concrete Idea ferments and turns itself against the divisions of reflection."60 On the other hand, like Mendelssohn, Hegel too is wearied by the eccentricities of Hamann's style: "The French have a saying: Le stile cest Vhomme meme\ Hamann's writings do not so much have a characteristic style as they are style through and through . . . they are really a tiring puzzle, and one sees that their key word is the individuality of their author."61 Consequently, Hegel says, Hamann failed to develop his thought into a genuine "system." Instead, "closed in particular subjectivity, in which Hamann's genius did not develop into conceptual or artistic form, it could only develop into humor . . . [which] in itself, according to its subjective nature, is too much inclined toward self-satisfaction, subjective particularities, and trivial content. . . ,"62 And so Hegel concludes that: Hamann did not make the effort that God ... did to develop the balled kernel of truth ... in reality into a system of nature, into a system of state, laws and morality, into a system of world history, into an open hand, whose fingers are outstretched, in order to grasp the human spirit and draw it unto itself, which, likewise, is not a merely abstruse intelligence, a stifled, concentrated move- ment in itself . . . but an unfolded system of intelligent organiza- tion, whose formal pinnacle is thought. . . .63 Ultimately, though, this passage does not say so much about Hamann as it does about Hegel. Hegel fails, moreover, to appreciate that Hamann's writ- ings are precisely not lyrical or self-indulgent, but carefully crafted mirrors of introspection intended for the awakening or conversion of the particular 59 Hegel, Werke, 11:280. 60 Ibid., 324. 61 Ibid., 281 (Dunning's translation). 62 Ibid., 336. 63 Ibid., 330-31. Ill</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 readers he has in mind; thus Hamann could say to Kant, "My mimic style is governed by a stricter logic and closer connections than in the concepts of livelier minds."64 But Hegel also lets his admiration be known: "We of a later generation must admire him as an original of his time, but can regret that his time did not provide him with a ready spiritual form with which his genius could have fused and produced true forms for the pleasure and satisfaction of his and subsequent generations. . . ,"65 V. KIERKEGAARD ON HAMANN: "THE GREATEST HUMORIST IN CHRISTENDOM" After Hegel, the most important interpreter of Hamann is Kierkegaard, who stands at a considerable distance from Hamann's contemporaries both in time and in sensibility. But though Kierkegaard's perspective on Hamann is necessarily remote, his familiarity with German intellectual life allows for clear lines of continuity. It is also likely that Kierkegaard read Hegel's re- view of Hamann and that this in part shaped his own opinion of Hamann. For example, like Hegel, Kierkegaard makes much of Hamann's humor. Indeed, Kierkegaard reads Hamann primarily as a Christian humorist. But whereas Hegel supposed Hamann's humor to be a subjective expression of his personality, Kierkegaard recognized more keenly that it was equally grounded in the objective worldview of Christianity. A further difference is that whereas Hegel criticized Hamann for his humor, individuality, and stubborn resistance to systematic thought and forms of expression, it was precisely for these reasons that Kierkegaard (at least initially) found him so fascinating. Of course, in order fully to appreciate Hamann's wit, one must read him with some care, since his jokes are nearly always cryptic. But even the most cursory of readings will afford some impression of his humor. One will immediately notice, for example, the comical collection of pseudonyms he assumes: "a lover of boredom," "a hierophant's handyman," "Abigail," "Aristobulus," "Abaelardus Virbius," "Vettius Epagathus Regiomontico- lae" (i.e., from Konigsberg), an apocryphal sibyl named "Adelgunde," an "angry prophet from the brook Kerith," "Ahasverus Lazarus Elias Redivi- vus," "a preacher in the wilderness," "«« sauvage du nord," "Zacchaeus the publican," "a Prussian school teacher named Heinrich Schroder," "a 64 Hamann, BriefwechseL 1:378. 65 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 1:337. 112</page><page sequence="21">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas fifty-year old cleric in Swabia," the Chinaman "Mien-man-hoam," and so on. Other more obvious examples of his humor include his practice of anonymously reviewing reviews of his own pseudonymous works, and his frequent use of prosopopeia. A particularly hilarious example of the latter is Hamann's satire, New Apology of the Letter h Written by Itself \ in which the terminal letter h, facing imminent elimination at the hands of ortho- graphical reformers who cannot bear its contingency and seeming superflu- ity, begins its prophetic tirade with the tart reminder, "Your life is what I am - a breath."66 And then, to give one last example, there is the ludicrous title he proposed to Herder for a first edition of his writings, "Bathhouse Quackeries" [Saalbadereien], and the still more comical title he suggested for the initial volume, "First Little Tub" [Erstes Wannchen].67 What Kierkegaard especially appreciated about Hamann's humor, however, was the way in which it went hand in hand with the "folly" of Christianity - a folly that is really the wisdom of God and puts every proud rationalism to shame (1 Cor. l:18ff.). And, true enough, as Hamann put it to Jacobi, "The folly of Christianity is entirely suited to my taste. . . ."68 Kierkegaard explains this kind of humor as follows: ". . . everything which hitherto had asserted itself in the world and continued to do so was placed in relation to the presumably single truth of the Christians, and therefore to the Christians the kings and the princes, enemies and persecutors, etc., etc., appeared to be nothing and to be laughable because of their opinions of their own greatness."69 Similarly, he writes, "The humorous, present throughout Christianity, is expressed in a fundamental principle which de- clares that the truth is hidden in the mystery (ev u/uornoia) ajioxQDqpr]). . . . This is a view of life which regards worldly wisdom humorously to the wth degree."70 Though Kierkegaard here suggests that the Christian worldview is es- sentially humorous, it is clear that here and throughout his observations on humor he has the example of Hamann foremost in mind: 66 Hamann, SW, 3:105ff. 67 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 5:204. The term "Saalbadereien" is almost impossible to trans- late. At one level, it suggests the act of giving someone a bath in a bathing salon (which was Hamann's father's occupation); it also contains the word "Salbaader," which can mean both a "babbler" as well as a "quack doctor," who cures patients with salves. Thus, "Saalbadereien" suggests the curative methods of a babbling quack doctor in a bathing salon. 68 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 5:275. 69 JP 2:1674. 70 Ibid., 1682. 113</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 Hamann could become a good representative of the humor in Christianity . . . but in him the trend toward humor necessarily developed one-sidedly (a) because of the humor intrinsic to Chris- tianity, (b) because of the isolation of the individual conditioned by the Reformation, an isolation which did not arise in Catholi- cism, which since it had a Church could oppose "the world," al- though in its pure concept as Church it probably was less able to be predisposed to do this, and in any case it nevertheless could not develop humor to an apex opposing everything and thereby rather barren, at least devoid of prolific vegetation and bearing only dwarfed, scrawny birch (the reason this was not the case with Hamann is to be found in his profound sensibility and enormous genius, which had depth corresponding to the degree of its nar- rowness in width - and Hamann found a real delight in inviting his knowledge-greedy contemporaries, platter-lickers, to his long- necked stork flask - but just the same he can be a very good repre- sentative for the true center of this position), and (c) because of his own naturally humorous disposition. Thus one can truthfully say that Hamann is the greatest humorist in Christianity (meaning the greatest humorist in the view of life which itself is the most humor- ous view of life in world-history - therefore the greatest humorist in the world).71 One sees here how much Kierkegaard genuinely admired Hamann - whom else did he ever praise for "profound sensibility and enormous genius"? Indeed, from 1836-37, Kierkegaard lauded Hamann's humor as an expres- sion of "the most profound earnestness about life." "Humor," he remarks at one point, "is lyrical - it is the most profound earnestness about life - profound poetry, which cannot form itself as such and therefore crystallizes in baroque forms - it is hemorrhoidal non fluens - the molimina of the higher life."72 Similarly, comparing Hamann to Ludwig Tieck and E. T. A. Hoffman, he concludes: "No, Hamann is still the greatest and most authen- tic humorist, the genuinely humorous Robinson Crusoe, not on a desert island but in the noise of life; his humor is not an esthetic concept but life, not a hero in a controlled drama."73 At the same time, however, Kierkegaard clearly signals his dissatisfac- 71 Ibid., 1681. 72 Ibid., 1690. 73 Ibid., 1699. 114</page><page sequence="23">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas tion with the "one-sidedness" of Hamann's humor - suggesting that he en- visioned other possibilities for a distinctly Christian humor that he himself, presumably, would fulfill. And, in fact, over the years he came precisely to adopt a more negative opinion of Hamann's humor, presuming to discern a "noble pride" behind the "folly" of Hamann's witness: The ignorance of the Christian (this purely Socratic view, as in Hamann, for example) is, of course, also humorous, for what is its basis but a forcing of oneself down in this way to the lowest posi- tion and looking up (that is, down) at the ordinary view, yet in such a way that behind this self-degrading there lies a high degree of self-elevating (the humility of the Christian which in its polemi- cal form against the world increases his own wretchedness, while on the other hand in its normative form it involves a noble pride (the least in the kingdom is greater than John the Baptist) or in its abnormality a haughty isolation from the course of ordinary events (the historical nexus).74 It is unfortunate that Kierkegaard was not better acquainted with the de- tails of Hamann's life and was ignorant, in particular, of the journals of Princess Amalia von Gallitzin (1748-1806), who knew Hamann and re- vered him as a saint. Had Kierkegaard had access to such materials, he could never have supposed Hamann's humility to be false or affected.75 On the face of it, however, Kierkegaard has a point. As Stephen Dunning puts it, "Kierkegaard is accusing [Hamann's] Christian 'humility' of hiding within itself a sort of arrogance, of hypocritically disguising itself as igno- rance when in fact it is humoristically ridiculing the wisdom of the world."76 Thus Kierkegaard notes that for this humorous view of life mira- cle comes to play an important, even primary role: . . . because all the most profound ideas of the sages become (in this view) as nothing, along with Balaam's prophesying ass. The more insignificant the miracle is, if I may say so, or the less it enters into relationship with the historical development, yes, even to the point that this view, so to speak, tempts God - that is, wanting a 74 Ibid., 1682. 75 See Betz, After Enlightenment, chapter 13. 76 Stephen Dunning, "Kierkegaard's 'Hegelian' Response to Hamann," Thought 55 (1980): 263. 115</page><page sequence="24">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 miracle performed only to disconcert the professors of physics - the more pleased it is; indeed, this view would rejoice most of all over the changing of wine into water at Cana. . . . Therefore this view usually dwells upon the crib, upon the rags in which the child was wrapped, upon the crucifixion between two thieves.77 What is so curious about Kierkegaard's final judgment is that he not only objects to such Christian humor, but even comes to share Hegel's negative opinion of Hamann's style: "Precisely because humor wants to have the absolute without the relative, it fumbles around in the most desperate leap- ing, always within the most appalling relativity - The same glass magnifies (a blade of grass is worth more than all ingenuity) and diminishes (rather hear wisdom from the mouth of a Pharisee against his will than from an apostle)."78 Whatever Kierkegaard may have meant by "wanting to have the absolute without the relative" - which does not square with Hamann's acute sense of the kenotic presence of the divine in creation and history (which is to say, of the Absolute in the relative) - it is undoubtedly true that Hamann's style abounds in "relativity," leaping without any apparent connection from one allusion to another.79 It is also true that Hamann de- lights in unwitting prophecies, such as those of Hume (concerning the mi- raculous quality of faith), Caiaphas (Jn 18:14), or Pilate (Jn 19:19).80 As Hamann puts it, in the very passage to which Kierkegaard alludes, "I often hear the Word of God with more joy in the mouth of a Pharisee, as a wit- ness against his will, than from the mouth of an angel of light."81 It is precisely in this connection that Kierkegaard quips, "Humor can therefore approach blasphemy; Hamann would rather hear wisdom from Balaam's ass or from a philosopher against his will than from an angel or an apostle."82 But, as Dunning rightly points out, "Hamann never put it that way." In fact, Kierkegaard has spliced together two different quotations to an exaggerated effect. For that matter, Hamann delighted not in blasphemy, but in the fact that truth could be revealed in such surprising and implausi- 77 JP 2:1682. The passage Kierkegaard has in mind is from Hamann's Fragments (Ha- mann, SW, 1: 304). 78 JP 2:1722. 79 Cf.. Hamann, SW, 2:61. See, however, Hamann's remark to Kant that his writings are anything but disordered and desultory (footnote 64). 80 See, for example, Hamann, SW, 1:304; Hamann, SW, 2:205; Hamann, SW, 3:133. 81 Hamann, Briefwechsel, 1:431. 82 /P 2:1693. 116</page><page sequence="25">Betz ♦ /. G. Hamann in the History of Ideas ble ways.83 Indeed, this is but an illustration of God's sovereign glory: that even God's enemies unwittingly serve him, as Hamann was happy to dis- cover in the case of Hume. As Hamann puts it in the Fragments, "This is illustrated in the strange story of Saul and Balaam; that even among the idols, indeed, in the very instruments of hell, the revelation of God is mani- fest; and that he himself uses them as his servants, like Nebuchadnezzar."84 What is ultimately at issue with Kierkegaard's critique of Hamann's humor, therefore, and what ultimately offended his more pietistic sensibility, was Hamann's radical Lutheran "worldliness," which could find God, ironi- cally, even in sin and creaturely defiance. As Karlfried Griinder puts it, "That Hamann seeks 'truth' (in Kierkegaard's emphatic sense) in the world, in the sensible (the five barley loaves), in the unlettered (among the chil- dren), in the base (Balaam's ass), and even in the sinful (the Pharisees against their will) ... in this respect Kierkegaard finds Hamann guilty of going too far, of indulging irony to the point of blasphemy."85 But if this offended Kierkegaard's more dialectical sensibility, it is also what allowed Hamann to "reconcile with all existence," indeed, to take pleasure in this world, having come to see in everything the traces of God's providence and the "plays of his wit."86 VI. HAMANN IN THE HISTORY OF IDEAS However one ultimately judges Hamann, his importance to the history of ideas should by now be clear, even if, in the accounting of modern histori- ography, he is still considered a quantite negligeable. It should also be clear that Hamann was by no means an irrationalist, as Isaiah Berlin has unfortu- nately and misleadingly portrayed him. But what else might one take away from this brief survey of his reception? First, that Hamann was difficult to read and understand even for the most learned of his contemporaries, but that the greater lights of the age nevertheless found him alluring and worthy of serious attention, as though an important prophetic message lay hidden amid the darkness of his allusions. But then, what was the content of this message? And what parts of it entered by way of Kant, Herder, Goethe, Jacobi, Schelling, Hegel, and Kierkegaard, et. al. into the history of ideas? 83 Dunning, "Kierkegaard's 'Hegelian' Response to Hamann," 264. 84 Hamann, S W, 1:304. 85 Johann Georg Hamanns Hauptschriften Erkldrt (Gutersloh: Carl Bertelsmann Verlag, 1956-63), 1:50. 86 Hamann, Briefwechsel, l:344f. 117</page><page sequence="26">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JANUARY 2009 As the variety of different interpretations on the part of such different figures would suggest, it is impossible to reduce Hamann's thought to any one particular theme. His thought is simply too rich. Nevertheless, one might attempt to summarize his contribution to the history of ideas thus: To Kant he introduced the thought of Hume, forcing Kant to undertake a more critical assessment of reason's limits; to Herder (and Hegel) he im- parted a profound appreciation for reason's historical-linguistic embodi- ment; to Goethe he pointed the way beyond French classicism to a distinctly German literature; to Jacobi he confirmed that reason without faith cannot sustain itself and leads to nihilism; to Hegel and Schelling he signaled new and grander possibilities for philosophy by way of his understanding of nature and history in terms of divine kenosis; to Schelling, in particular, he pointed the way toward Schelling's late positive philosophies of mythology and revelation; and to Kierkegaard he presented a model of pseudonymous Christian authorship in an age of unbelief, not to mention the original forms of such "Kierkegaardian" doctrines as the "paradox," the "teleologi- cal suspension of the ethical," "indirect communication," and "the infinite difference between God and human beings." Hamann, admittedly, is ob- scure and, given the difficulty of his writings, will remain so. The lesson for modern historiography, however, is that occasionally - Hamann being a case in point - some of the most potent and influential thinkers of a genera- tion go unnoticed.
