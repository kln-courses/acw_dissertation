At the time of the discovery, the piece was described as being deliberately modified, but since then it has been either ignored or described only as problematic evidence of Neanderthal symbolic behavior. In this work, we provide a new description and additional documentation of the piece, and we discuss its anthropic nature and the possibility that its meaning can be related to the small but credible record of graphic behavior known for early hominin groups prior to the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. The linear design theme of the Axlor piece is similar to that of other items made by European Neanderthals. These artifacts confirm the capability of pre-Homo sapiens sapiens humans to create and use portable "art. " This tradition is evidence of the emergence of "behavioral modernity" among late Neanderthals. Graphic behavior (e.g., engraving or painting) is a form of symbolic expression. Research into symbolic behavior is a topic of interest in archaeological studies and for this reason, numerous researchers have analyzed early archaeological evidence of non-economic activities (d'Errico et al. 2003; Henshilwood and d'Errico 2011; Leroi-Gourhan 1971; Mithen 2005). Ancient evidence of symbolism is not confined to graphic behavior. Interpreted as representing the origins of "behavioral modernity" (Zilhào 2007), symbolism integrates other types of individual and collective behavior, such as burial (placement and manipulation of corpses); acquisition of an articulate system of oral communication (language) and instrumental sound (music); activities (e.g., rituals) with material correlates; natural or religious cosmologies (science and faith, superstition); production of various materials (ochre and ornaments) for social uses by a group or an individual; Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 69, 2013 Copyright © by The University of New Mexico 397</page><page sequence="2">398 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH the deliberate arrangement or collection of animal bones, stones, minerals, fossils, and shells; the invention of social organizational categories such as "family" and "territory," etc. These human behaviors are cognitive adaptations that were fossilized in some cases, and in others, lost. Their emergence and development are intimately linked to factors of social and environmental adaptation and/ or biological and demographic development (Deacon 1997; Knight et al. 1995; Mithen 1996, 2005; Shennan 2001), and their emergence was not synchronic. Traditionally, graphic capacity has been attributed solely to Homo sapiens sapiens in Europe. Upper Paleolithic portable and rock art have been considered an attribute of modem behavior, which has been linked to progressive formal complexity and aesthetic development (e.g., Breuil 1952; Leroi-Gourhan et al. 1995). As a result, non-figurative decorated objects from Mousterian levels of several European (i.e., Suard, Saint Anne I, Oldisleben 1, Vaufrey, Prolom II, Lartet, Marillac, Petit Puymoyen, La Quina, Cotencher, La Ferrassie, L'Ermitage, Turské Mastale, and Temnata) and Near Eastern (Quneitra [Marshack 1996] and Qafzeh [Plovers et al. 1997]) archaeological sites were not seen as representative of symbolic capacity because this behavior was considered exclusive to Homo sapiens sapiens (Mellars et al. 2007). This is a clear case of circular reasoning in our opinion. In recent years, new discoveries in Africa (e.g., Cape Hangklip; Klein Kliphuis [Mackay and Welz 2008]; Wonderwerk [Chazan and Horwitz 2009]; Blombos [Henshilwood et al. 2009] ; Apollo II [Vogelsang et al. 2010] ; Diepkloof [Texier et al. 2010]; Pinnacle Point [Watts 2010]; and Klasies River Mouth [d'Errico et al. 2012]), and new approaches to the interpretation of portable pieces from Europe and Near East (d'Errico et al. 2003), are beginning to change the theoretical paradigm (Zilhâo 2011), showing that the acquisition of this form of symbolic expression was gradual and not a (sub)species-specific phenomenon (d'Errico et al. 2003; Zilhâo 2007). In this study, we reanalyze a pecked sandstone pebble recovered in a Middle Paleolithic layer of Axlor cave. Our analysis confirms the anthropogenic and deliberate nature of the markings and highlights the importance of studying forgotten archaeological objects recovered many years ago. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE Axlor rockshelter is located in Dima (Vizcaya, Spain) (Figure 1) in Lower Cretaceous (Urgonian) limestone (Ente Vasco de la Energia 1992); it is oriented toward the north-northwest. High relief, an abundance of water, diverse lithic materials, and the presence of abundant game animals characterizes the local environment of the site. The archaeological site was excavated by J. M. de Barandiarân between 1967 and 1974 (Baldeôn 1999; de Barandiarân 1980). New fieldwork has been carried out since 1999 (Castanos 2005; Gonzalez Urquijo et al. 2005, 2006; Rios 2005, 2006; Rios et al. 2003). Ten stratigraphie levels were defined during the first phase of fieldwork in a deposit that was 4 m deep; the recent work has described a new sequence of stratigraphie and cultural levels (A to P).</page><page sequence="3">NEANDERTHAL PECKED PEBBLE FROM AXLOR 399 Figure 1. Location of the archaeological site of Axlor rockshelter (northern Spain). The Axlor cultural layers are all Middle Paleolithic. J. M. de Barandiarân identified 9 levels (I to IX), and the recent fieldwork, at least 17 (A to P). Level D (probably equivalent to level IV of de Barandiarân's sequence) was dated by AMS C14 to 42,010 ± 1,280 and &gt;43,000 bp, and level F (probably equivalent to V) to &gt;47,500 and 33,310 ± 360 bp1 (Gonzalez Urquijo et al. 2005; Rios 2006). Some levels, mainly in the middle of the deposit, show evidence of intensive occupation. The lithic assemblages are characteristic of the Charentian Mousterian facies. The upper levels (A to L) are characterized by the production of tools by Quina technological systems, with an abundance of sidescrapers. The lower levels (M to P) are characterized by Levallois technology and a greater variety of retouched tools, including a large percentage of points. The exploitation of raw materials reflects the lithological diversity of the surrounding environment; flints are the main raw materials used in the upper levels. The fauna correspond with grassland, rocky, and forest habitats. The upper levels display considerable diversification of game, whereas in the lower levels the high percentage of red deer (+60%) suggests some degree of specialization. The stratigraphie sequence attests to a temperate and humid climate, with a tendency toward cooling in the upper levels. THE ENGRAVED PEBBLE OF AXLOR The Context During the 1969 fieldwork (de Barandiarân 1980), a sandstone pebble with apparent human modifications (Figures 2 and 3) was recovered in level VIII (correlated with level Ν of the recent excavation, dating to &gt;47,500 bp).

(Photo and image by the authors)</page><page sequence="5">NEANDERTHAL PECKED PEBBLE FROM AXLOR 401 The level from which the pebble was recovered (VIII) was deposited under a temperate and humid climate. The faunal remains indicate a wooded biotope, with a majority of red deer (75%), followed by other ungulates (ibex, chamois, horse, and bovines). The human group used mainly local lithic materials (75% flysch flint) and only a small percentage of other materials. Lithic production is characterized by the in situ reduction of Levallois cores to produce retouched tools (points and sidescrapers) on Levallois flakes. In addition, small cores and thick flakes were used to produce micro-Levallois flakes. The human occupation of level VIII displays residential stability because several hearths and other indications of spatial organization were found (Rios 2006). The relatively long term, intensive exploitation of resources focused on deer hunting and local raw material provisioning. The Axlor pebble was described (de Barandiarân 1980) as a "canto arenisco semiesférico que, en la cara plana, tiene depresiones semejando una aspa ο una cara humana(?)."2 Lorblanchet ( 1999:189) has described it, using de Barandiarân's record, as "une étrange petite pierre de grès semi-sphérique qui, du côté plat, montre deux cupules et une rainure médiane lui donnant l'aspect d'une grossière face humaine."3 The piece is now preserved in the Arkeologi Museoa of Bilbao and is catalogued as item Ax. 1 IB.425.4. Description and Analysis The pebble was examined and analyzed using a binocular microscope (Olympus DF and SZX10), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 600, FEI), and X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X'Pert PRO). A three-dimensional model was obtained using a laser scan (Next Engine) technique (Figure 4). The maximum dimensions are 58.4 mm long, 49.9 mm wide, and 32 mm thick); the color is dark brown (7.5 YR 4/2 Munsell). The material is a split subcircular pebble of sandstone; the grain of the material is coarse and the semi-quantitative analysis (Figure 5) shows a composition of I," ■ III Figure 4.

The type of stone is common in the surrounding environment (EVE 1992): the sandstone outcrop is from the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) of the Yurre Formation. The upper surface of the pebble is convex, the texture is rough, and it shows no evidence of modifications. The lower surface displays a marked angular delineation and evidence of human manipulation. The lower surface is flat and in the left lower quadrant exhibits two technological negatives produced by impact points; these morphologies (lines) are probably the result of technical actions intended to divide the original pebble in half and create a surface for engraving. Their description is difficult because of the poor conservation and the lithology of the pebble (the size of the grains does not allow a precise definition of the edges and the inside of the grooves). The small impact points create two lines. One is 44.5 mm long, is vertical relative to the longest axis, and is located in a central position. The morphology of the edges of the impact points is irregular and discontinuous, and the width (between 1 and 7.5 mm) is variable. This line is formed by two grooves separated by around 1 mm and corresponds to the central vertical line of de Barandiarân's drawing. The second line is transverse to line A. The width (between 1 and 9.5 mm) and the morphology of the edges vary more than those of line A. This line is formed by two grooves and corresponds to the depressions or "presumed eyes" of the human face proposed by de Barandiarân. The morphology of the impact points (barely recognizable owing to the poor condition of the pebble support and the preservation treatment used) is variable (Figure 6A and B). Generally, they show elongated morphology (up to 3 mm of development) and tend to diminish in width (the average width is approximately 1.5 mm). One of the ends is rectilinear or irregular; the opposing extremity of each pecked line is rectilinear, irregular, or comes to an asymmetric point. These shapes help us identify the direction from which the impact points were made</page><page sequence="7">NEANDERTHAL PECKED PEBBLE FROM AXLOR 403 I I Figure 6.

Considering the varied orientation of the longest axis of the impact points and the morphologies of the pit ends, we conclude that either the working direction was variable or the pebble was rotated during the creation of the grooves. DISCUSSION: THE PRE-UPPER PALEOLITHIC GRAPHIC TRADITION IN EUROPE The pebble of Axlor has been forgotten of late in the scientific debates on the origins and development of human graphic behavior. The slight impact of de Barandiarân's publication and the minimal description of this piece published by M. Lorblanchet (1999) led it to being considered a Mousterian item with an ambiguous role in the origins of art. The present study has determined that the engraving of Axlor involved use of the soft percussion technique; this type of intentional transformation was used to produce both the semispherical shape of the support and the grooves. The graphic element is the two transverse lines that compose an angular design (a cross- or X-shaped form). The discovery of this artifact in level VIII (N), with a lithic industry corresponding to the Middle Paleolithic and older than 47,500 bp, confirms the existence of graphic behavior among the late Neanderthal populations of northern Spain and western Europe. This behavior has been documented in early Paleolithic times in Europe (Bednarik 2003; d'Errico et al. 2003). The oldest pieces are associated with a non Acheulian Lower Paleolithic flake industry from the Bulgarian site of Kozarnica, dated to approximately 1 mya (Guadelli and Guadelli 2004). The engraved bone and ivory fragments from the German archaeological site of Bilzingsleben (Mania and Mania 1988; Mania 1991; Steguweit 1999) are more recent (between 350,000 and 250,000 bp): the lineal motifs thereon have been accepted by many researchers, but other figures—especially some geometric forms and the supposedly anthropomorphic or animal ones—should be considered with caution (Lorblanchet 1999:164-69). However, the majority of the pre-Upper Paleolithic European pieces and the greatest diversity of graphic motifs—mainly lineal—correspond to the Mousterian period. At the end of OIS6 and the beginning of OIS5, the number of pieces showing evidence of a graphic tradition increased progressively: Abri Suard (Crémades 1996), Saint Anne I (Raynal and Seguy 1986), Oldisleben 1 (Bednarik 2003; Gunther 1994), Vaufrey (Vicent 1988), Tata (Bednarik 1995), El Castillo (Cabrera et al. 2004), and Prolom II (Stepanchuk 1993). The linear compositions that have an angular shape (as at Axlor) are unusual. The pebble of Axlor is similar to the angular motif on the plaque from Tata (Hungary), dated by U-series between 68,000 and 114,400 bp (Moncel 2003) and associated with Quina-type Mousterian assemblages (Vértes 1964) with a high microlithic component, but the technique and the general configuration of the pieces are noticeably different: the modified object from Tata is a silicate nummulite, with a discoidal morphology and a natural fracture on both surfaces that structures the piece into two parts. According to Bednarik (1995), the symmetrical character of the fracture and the</page><page sequence="9">NEANDERTHAL PECKED PEBBLE FROM AXLOR 405 geometric form of the piece could have attracted the attention of the inhabitants of Tata; subsequently the people took the natural object and engraved a line on it that transversely cuts the natural fracture. Therefore, the piece is divided into four symmetrical parts. In addition, the physical support (sandstone in Axlor and an exotic fossil in Tata) and the technique (Axlor: percussion to obtain a working surface and engraving to make the motif; Tata: use of the morphology of the natural support plus artificial incision) differentiate the pieces. Otherwise the final configuration of the graphic component (X-shaped or two differentiated lines that intersect transversally) and the organization of the motif on the physical support (with a working field occupying the entire area of the surface) link them closely. The pieces from Axlor and Tata are examples of continuity and formal convergence between pre-Upper Paleolithic human societies in western and central Europe. The pieces with graphic motifs become more significant around the beginning of OIS3. Bone and stone objects from the archaeological sites of Le Moustier (Peyrony 1934), Abri Lartet (Debénath and Duport 1971), Marillac (Duport 1973), Le Petit Puymoyen (Debénath and Duport 1971), La Quina (Martin 1907 1910, 1910; Marshack 1991), Cotencher (Dubois and Stehlin 1933), La Ferrassie (Bordes 1969; Capitan and Peyrony 1921; Defleur 1993), L'Ermitage (Pradel and Pradel 1954), various Italian archaeological sites (Leonardi 1988), Turské Mastale (Neustupny 1948), and Temnata (Crémades et al. 1995) have engraved pieces associated with the middle to late phases of the Middle Paleolithic. The non-figurative motifs of the European pre-Upper Paleolithic pieces display conceptualized lineal patterns of diverse character based on a rhythm of ordination and a hierarchy of lines. The themes are mainly structured on rectilinear lines with a parallel tendency. This thematic coexists with other representations in Europe—for example, the cupules (pecked pits) on a stone slab associated with Mousterian burials in La Ferrassie (Capitan and Peyrony 1921; Defleur 1993; Lorblanchet 1999:191-95). This information is consistent with U-series dates obtained on parietal art from El Castillo cave and suggests that late Neanderthals could have painted the non-figurative forms found in western European caves (Pike et al. 2012). The "Neanderthal face" of La Roche Cotard associated with artifacts of the Mousterian of Acheulian tradition (Marquet and Lorblanchet 2003) might be considered the first attempt at figurative representation, but other authors (e.g., Pettitt 2003) think it is not possible to confirm human agency. Thus, as of today, it is not possible to affirm that the graphic behavior of European pre-Upper Paleolithic societies was figurative. These cases show that the emergence of graphic behavior in the archaeological record is not necessarily related to the biological capabilities of Homo sapiens sapiens. The lineal character of European Neanderthal themes is similar to the graphic tradition documented at archaeological sites in Africa (Henshilwood and Marean 2011) and the Near East (d'Errico et al. 2003) that were produced by early anatomically modern humans. This tradition emerged independently among different human populations and geographic territories. Probably, this "behavioral</page><page sequence="10">406 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH modernity" reflects changes in cultural, social, and territorial organization of human groups as a result of changes in the demographic structure (Shennan 2001). The graphic activity of Neanderthal groups of Europe would be a consequence of the gradual population expansion and increased human interactions throughout OIS3. In this context, intentionally marked items constitute a highly relevant key to social life. The transfer of information through visual perception is a mechanism of social interaction and communicative behavior (Burton 1992; Langton and Bruce 2000). This point of view considers the high probability that early pieces with markings are representative of symbolic behavior. The pebble of Axlor exhibits several supporting factors (summarized by d'Errico et al. 2012): (a) the selection of the raw material—sandstone is poorly represented in the Axlor archaeological record, and it is not used for making lithic tools; (b) the pebble was intentionally prepared by percussion to obtain a flat surface before modifying the original morphology of the support; (c) the way in which the lines were made is considered unusual because other technical activités related to this kind of percussion were not documented in the rockshelter lithic assemblage; (d) the relatively regular configuration of the lines and the angular and symmetrical nature at their intersection imply neuromotor control during the percussion and creation (planning and coordination) of the design; and (e) when the graphic-thematic antecedent at Tata is considered, both lithic assemblages are characterized by a Middle Paleolithic industry with a high microlithic component. Based on all these arguments, we consider the graphic behavior documented in Axlor as representative of the symbolic behavior capacities of the late Neanderthals of western Europe. CONCLUSION The pecked pebble with an X-shaped motif from Axlor is evidence of graphic symbolic behavior and the progressive social use of visual perception of the Neanderthals of Europe. The graphic subject represented on the Axlor pebble shows the pictorial diversity of the linear theme. The structure and the rhythmic sequence of the lines document a non-figurative conceptualized behavior that was also present in Homo sapiens sapiens populations in Africa and the Near East. The emergence of the capability for graphic thinking is not a (sub)species-specific phenomenon. The linear theme depicted in the Axlor pebble coexisted with other forms of expression (cupules at La Ferrassie and a singular figurative piece at La Roche Cotard) that are rarely portrayed in the literature and that probably did not have as much social incidence among the Neanderthal populations as the lineal graphic tradition.
