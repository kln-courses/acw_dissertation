(Études thé- matiques 13) Prix : € 35.00 ; € 40.00 This vast investigation of weights and measures in Southeast Asia is finally complete with the recent publi- cation of the second volume. Alain Testart, who is not a Southeast Asianist, contributes a preface on weights and measures in general. Pierre Le Roux then offers a com- parative treatment of measures and measurements drawn largely from the other contributions, but also giving a good deal of attention to France and the introduction of the "modern" systems in the revolutionary period. What follows is forty-one articles on Southeast Asian and other Asian or near Asian peoples by forty-three authors. These are all highly specific in their focus with only moderate attention given to comparative issues. Most are extremely detailed and almost all are broadly comparable in their range of topics. Thus, apart from the first two contributions, comparison is achieved more by juxtaposition than by cross-referencing and anal- ysis. The result is an impressive contribution to our acknowledge, but one which is extensive rather than exhaustive. Although a great deal of previous descriptive work is cited and exploited by the authors, there is much more that they have not been able to refer to, if only because numerically the groups discussed make up only a fraction of all those living in this geographical region. The papers relate to the following language fami- lies: Autstronesian, Austroasiatic, Thai-Kadai, Tibeto- Burman, Karen (a subgroup of Tibeto-Burman), Indo- Nepalese, and Miao-Yao. Topics covered include mea- surements of length, width, breadth, height, depth, weight, volume, capacity, circumference, time, curren- cy, coins, price, metal, grains, fluids, land, weapons, clothing, the movement of celestial bodies, dimensions and parts of houses, and many other matters.

Because they have decided to restrict themselves rather closely to weights and measures, there are inevitably some topics which are not covered to the same extent as others. Symbolism and oracles for example get some attention, but are relatively neglected - although the opposition between odd and even num- bers comes up for consideration from time to time -, and there is no attention to what might be called sym- bolic arithmetic in which different rules of equivalence than the normal ones are in effect. On the other hand they want their book to be regarded as a contribution to economic history, as well as anthropology. The papers touch on all of the countries of Mar- itime Southeast Asia (except Brunei and Timor L'Esté) and Mainland Southeast Asia, although Singapore is mentioned only in passing. There are additional con- tributions pertaining to Taiwan, New Guinea, Mada- gascar, Nepal, Tibet, and China. The first volume is devoted to Austronesian Southeast Asia and its borders (counting Madagascar as a border region). The second volume deals with Mainland Southeast Asia north of Malaysia and Malay-speaking parts of Thailand, as well as countries bordering the states of this part of South- east Asia. Some of the peoples considered have adopted prac- tices from the West or from China. Others seem to remain fairly immune from outside borrowings. Many of the units of measurement are termed anthropomorphic by the authors: armpit, fathom, hair, cubit, finger, span, stride, hip, hand, step, palm, phalanx, foot, handful, fistful, fist, chest, thumb, height. Such units can vary from region to region and from person to person. Prior to the French Revolution such units as the ell differed in length from country to country, and in France there were eight different feet in use simultaneously. Testart comments that, "the extreme regional variation which is so often deplored in the question of metrology in traditional societies is nothing other than the expression of the fragmentation of political power," and Le Roux titles his comparative introduction "From the Irregular (hétéroclite) to the Norm." Other units are not directly anthropomorphic. Baskets of various sizes are often used to measure not only quantities of what they contain but also area. Many other such containers, like jugs, bottles, carts, spoons, are also employed. In Burma a distance may be measured by the number of bellowings of a bull during the period of covering it. Such units may not be comparable and it may not be possible to relate them to each other. They derive their value from their specific functional utility. A cubit is not the best unit for measuring the distance between villages. These two volumes will serve as a very good in- troduction to their topic and an excellent research aid for anyone working on these questions in Southeast Asia. As Le Roux notes, general treatments of historical metrology usually show little interest in Southeast Asia. Now authors working on general issues will have a con- venient Southeast Asian source replete with information representative for the region as a whole. The individual articles are all of a high standard and clearly presented. There are many useful tables and photographs. The drawings are well executed. Historians and anthropol- ogists with Southeast Asian interests will want to keep these two volumes near to hand for ready reference. R. H. Barnes</page></plain_text>
