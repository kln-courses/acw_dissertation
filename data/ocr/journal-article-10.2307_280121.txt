Stryd (Cariboo College) carried out 2 months' investigation in the summer of 1980 at Monte Creek site, EdQx15, a large village site of at least 52 cultural depressions in the South Thompson River Valley. The work was done under contract with the Heritage Conservation Branch of the Province of British Columbia in con- junction with the Cariboo College archaeology field school. Thirteen cultural depressions, including food caches, oval house pits, and rectangular house pits were tested. Seven radiocarbon dates spanning the last 1,800 years suggest that the materials are referable to the Thompson Phase, ca. 2000 to 1400 B.P., and the Kamloops Phase, ca. 1400 to 200 B.P. The rectangular house pits are late prehistoric in age with radiocarbon dates of 190 + 130 (SFU-36), 200 ? 80 (SFU-33), and 1030 + 180 (SFU-38). Gordon Mohs (Chase, British Columbia) has also discovered rectangular and square house pit forms which appear to have been a local architectural specialization among the Shuswap Indians, not recorded in the ethnographic literature, in use over a 1000-year period from ca. A.D. 750 to ca. A.D. 1750. The distribution appears to be restricted to the east- ern Shuswap area and is concentrated within the South Thompson River watershed. Interconnected house pits and side entrances are common. Recent excavations of a rectangular house pit near Enderby, British Columbia, revealed two components. Three radiocarbon dates for the house are 490 + 130 (SFU-50), 430 ? 100 (SFU-56), and 980 ? 100 (SFU-57). James Haggarty (British Columbia Provincial Museum) with Jerome S. Cybulski (National Museum of Man), Donald Howes (British Columbia Ministry of Environment), and Morley Eldridge (University of Victoria) have analyzed the postcranial skeletal re- mains from Gore Creek in south central British Co- lumbia. These remains have been C-14 dated to 8250 ? 115 B.C. Haggarty Hall and Roberta Hall (Oregon State University) excavated 22 burials comprising an estimated 34 individuals at the Hill site (DfRu 4), estimated to date from sometime between 500 B.C. and A.D. 500. The Gore Creek skeleton may be repre- sentative of a "Paleowestern" population moving into British Columbia from the south in late Pleistocene or early Holocene times, whereas the later Hill site material is typical of the resident population. George McDonald (National Museum of Man) has completed an archaeological and ethnographic study of Kitwanga Fort, a fortified village with an extensive palisade, elaborate storage facilities, and escape tun- nels. Archaeological features are consistent with legends of a warrior named Nekt who built the fort as a base for raiding settlements along the Skeena River and adjacent coastal areas. Grant Keddie (British Columbia Provincial Museum) is investigating data claimed as evidence for Chinese exploration or settlement on the North Pacific Coast. Keddie is also completing a distribu- tional study of labrets and synthesizing their history and distribution on the Pacific rim from Washington to Japan. Following a brief season of testing in 1979, Roscoe Wilmeth (Archaeological Survey of Canada) and two assistants conducted excavations in 1980 in one house structure at the Nakwantlun site (FdSi-11), central interior British Columbia. The house, with ap- parently straight sides and rounded ends, differs from the pit houses common at the site. At least four occupation levels are recognized. The latest, just below surface, represents the late prehistoric 929</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Chilcotin Indians. Some projectile points show close resemblance to Middle Period forms from the Plains area, whereas material recovered in previous seasons seems more, closely related to Fraser River valley complexes. The earliest occupation, based on radiocarbon dates, has now been pushed back to 700 B.C. Microblades are completely absent, although they have been found in considerable numbers in other Anahim Lake components which date to the early centuries A.D. WASHINGTON. Washington State University and the Makah Nation continued their cooperative investigation of the Ozette Village Site (45CA24) under the direction of Richard D. Daugherty and Paul Gleeson. Excavation has been designed to recover in- formation from several protohistoric Makah long- houses destroyed by a catastrophic mudslide which sealed the deposit and preserved wood and bark ar- tifacts. To date, two houses have been completely ex- cavated and a third is nearly complete. Analyses recently finished include architecture (Jeffry Mauger], woodworking technology (Paul Gleeson), fish remains (David Huelsbeck), and cordage and basketry (Dale Croes). Studies in progress include studies of molluscan remains, the spatial distribution of features and artifacts, fish and mammalian re- mains, floral remains, bird remains, whale remains and whale bone technology, and lithic analysis and abrasion technology. Roderick Sprague and Priscilla Wegars (University of Idaho) conducted excavations at the Jose Bridge construction camp on the Snake River in Eastern Washington. The camp was occupied by skilled con- struction workers from about 1911 to 1914. Artifact analysis is intended to establish leisure time ac- tivities in an isolated construction camp and to com- pare consumption and disposal habits of itinerant ironworkers with those of settled railroad employees. OREGON. Jeffrey Flenniken (Washington State University) has been systematically recording the aboriginal reduction technologies employed at over 40 lithic scatters in southern Oregon. Within many of these sites, segregated reduction locations (small areas where a knapper reduced one or more pieces of lithic material into finished products) have been analyzed, providing specific technological data on lithic reduction. Four distinct lithic reduction tech- niques employed on the same raw materials have been defined. These reduction techniques may be limited in time. Data of this nature collected from both lithic scatters and excavated sites are being employed to establish a diachronic technological typology that will date lithic scatters in the Northern Great Basin. Penny McPherson (Western Cultural Resource Management, Inc.) directed excavations at three stratified open sites in Union County in advance of construction of Northwest Pipeline Corporation's Pan Alberta Natural Gas Pipeline Looping Route. The ob- jectives were data recovery, ascertaining the range of cultural activities represented in the impact zone. and determining the age of occupation at the sites. Data obtained at 35UN52, 35UN74, and 35UN95 in- dicate continuous utilization from at least Cascade Phase through Numipu Phase times, ca. 8000 B.P. to present. The preliminary basal date is 10,700 ? 830 B.P. There is abundant evidence for tool manufac- ture and quarry activity. More significantly, there is both direct and indirect evidence of camas process- ing at the Marshmeadow site (35UN95), indicating camas exploitation at least as early as Cascade phase times (8000 to 4500 B.P.). IDAHO. The Idaho State Historical Society spon- sored research at Givens Hot Springs on the Snake River in southern Idaho in 1979 and 1980 under the direction of Tom Green, Idaho State Archaeologist. Three deep pit houses and two smaller structures have been excavated. Based on a series of C-14 dates, the structures date between 4000 and 5000 B.P. Preliminary analysis indicates a winter occupa- tion. Significantly, no fish remains or fishing tackle have been recovered. The faunal remains have been identified by Dave Gillette, paleontologist at the Col- lege of Idaho. The Givens Hot Springs excavations are part of a larger project attempting to define the nature of changing settlement patterns in the Owyhee mountains and adjacent portions of the Snake River Plain. Jeanne M. Moe (University of Idaho) surveyed the Reynolds Creek watershed in the Owyhee Mountains to establish archaeological-environmental relations. The study was funded by Idaho State Historical Society and conducted in conjunction with Given Hot Springs excavation. A stratified random sampling procedure based on the diverse environmental zones found in the watershed was employed in the survey. Preliminary analysis indicates a strong correlation between some environmental factors, particularly the presence of aboriginal food plants and site distribution. The prehistoric subsistence pattern in this study area seems to be characterized by move- ment between elevations to utilize different resources, a pattern which resembles ethnographic subsistence patterns in the Columbia Plateau Culture Area. Kenneth M. Ames (Boise State University, Idaho State Historical Society) is continuing analysis of the very large Hatwai III component from the Hatwai site (10 NP 143). The component was recovered from a series of semisubterranean pit houses dating to the period 5000-3200 B.P. James P. Green (Boise State University) is completing analysis of the sediments from the sites, and Paul Sanders (University of Wyoming) is preparing the description of the Hatwai I component, which dates between 10,500 and 9800 B.P. The Hatwai project is supported by the Idaho Division of Highways and the Idaho State Historical Society. Ames is also conducting survey and testing projects in the Payette River drainage of southwest- ern Idaho. At this time the few tested sites appear to be no older than 4000 years B.P., on the basis of stratigraphic time markers. Mark G. Plew (Idaho State Historical Society) has 930 IVol. 46, No. 4, 1981]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH completed six field seasons of research in the Owyhee uplands as part of an ongoing study spon- sored by the Idaho State Historical Society, Boise State University, and Bureau of Land Management. These investigations have recorded 640 archaeolog- ical sites representing a wide range of activities. Survey data and test excavations of seven open camp sites, two rock shelters, two caves, and a workshop provide the basis for a tentative chronology and set- tlement model characterized by well-defined catch- ment areas in small drainages. A preliminary phase sequence has been defined. The phases are Camas Creek I, dated 4000 B.C.-700 B.C.; Camas Creek II, 700 B.C.-A.D. 600; Camas Creek III, A.D. 600-A.D. 1200; and Camas Creek IV, dated A.D. 1200-Historic Period. The Camas Creek III phase is the best docu- mented and has provided a partial basis for the recognition of Fremont culture elements in southern Idaho. During the summers of 1979 and 1980 excava- tions were conducted at Nahas Creek (10OE1674), located on Pole Creek, a secondary tributary of the Owyhee River. Four cultural zones were docu- mented. A Great Basin projectile point sequence in- cluding Humboldt, Elko, Rose Spring-Eastgate, and Desert Side Notched points was recovered. Seven radiocarbon dates document a 6,000-year sequence. The earliest date, 5990 + 170 B.P. (TX 3644) is from a hearth associated with milling stones. In addition to a varied material culture assemblage, the faunal col- lection included the first recovery of steelhead trout (Salmo gairdnerii) remains in Idaho. Outside the Owyhee area, Mark G. Plew conducted an archaeo- logical reconnaissance of state lands in Bear Lake and Franklin counties, Idaho, during the summer of 1980. Although few sites were recorded, amateur collections were documented and test excavations were conducted at the Hemmert Site (10 BL 14) on the north shore of Bear Lake. The Hammert Site an- pears to have Fremont affiliations. Working under the auspices of Idaho Archaeological Consultants. Mark G. Plew conducted test excavations at three sites along the Snake River in 1980. At Big Foot Bar in the Snake River Birds of Prey Natural Area south of Boise he recovered evidence of a wickiup type structu e dating to the period after A.D. 1200. During the fall of 1980 two important sites were investigated on the Snake River near Bliss, Idaho, for the Idaho Power Company. Site 10TF352 contained two distinct components, a Humboldt component anc a Rose Spring-Eastgate component. The association of Bison and artifacts with the Humboldt component at site 10TF352 marks the first such association in the western Snake River country. On the north side of the Snake River, opposite site 10TF352, a large open site (10GG1) consisting of four separate components dating after A.D. 1200 has been documented. An ex- tensive collection of salmon remains and the lack of semipermanent structures suggests the site may have been a spring fishing station. The intensity of occu- pation is indicated by the recovery of more than 500 pottery sherds-the single largest collection of pot- tery from any southern Idaho site. Frank Leonhardy GREATER SOUTHWEST The members of the Southwestern Anthropological Research Group (SARG) received a two-year grant from the National Science Foundation to update their computer records, to redefine certain coded variables relating site distributions to environment, and to test locational responses to stresses resulting from population/resource imbalances and environ- mental deterioration. Demographic curves are being developed for each project area. Currently, the com- puterized data bank contains information on the following projects: Cedar Mesa and Elk Ridge in Utah; Chevelon, Grand Canyon, Long House Valley, and Black Mesa in Arizona; and El Morro and Tijeras Canyon in New Mexico. A number of publications have resulted from the SARG project to date; a bibliog- raphy may be obtained by writing to Robert C. Euler, SARG Editor, Box 571, Grand Canyon, AZ 86023. The annual two-day Pecos Conference was held at Mesa Verde National Park, August 1980. Robert C. Euler (Grand Canyon National Park) and Fred Plog (Arizona State University) served as Program Chairs. While informal exchange of information remained the word of the day, the program was modified to provide a topical focus in addition to fieldwork reports. Overviews of the various regions were presented by: Jeffrey S. Dean (U Arizona)-Kayenta region: W. James Judge (Chaco Centerl -Chaco region; Joseph Tainter (U.S. Forest Service)-Mt. Taylor region; Linda Cordell (U New MexicoJ-Rio Grande region; T. J. Ferguson (Zuni Tribe)-Cibola region: Ar- thur H. Rohn (Witchita State)-Mesa Verde region Irn- dividual research projects were then presented and discussed. UTAH. Centuries Research Inc., under subcon- tract to Steven G. Baker, Consulting Archaeologist, has completed an intensive archaeological inventorv within the Central Lisbon Valley Study Tract in northern San juan County. Utah, with Kevin D. Black and James M. Copeland as Field Directors. The survey tract of 5,497 ha is located just south of the La Sal Mountains at the northern edge of the Anasazi sphere of influence. Five hundred forty-sever ar- chaeological sites and 290 isolated finds dating to the paleo-indian (Clovis) through Historic periods were recorded. Most of the sites are open lithic scatters, and a majority have been dated to the Archaic periodc on the basis of projectile point stvies. Diagnostic ar- tifacts document the presence of peoples of Clovis. Plano, Archaic, Anasazi, Ute/Paiute, Navajo, and Euro-American affiliation; Anasazi occupatior ap- pears to have been limited to a brief, early PII expar:- sion into the area. The hih overall site density en- countered (9.95 sites/km ) exceeds that predicted from previous sample surveys; further. Archaic sites of all functions are represented. These data sugges'. Lisbon Valley was a major Archaic activity locus. and thal wooded areas near open well-watered valleys were most favored for prehistoric settlement in this part of the Colorado Plateau. Meade Kemrer (ESCA-Tech Corp.) is directing a Class II Inventory of 6,070 ha for the Bureau of Land 931</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Management in south-central Utah. The project has been divided into three study tracts. Study Tract 1 (1,639 ha) is in the Table Cliff Plateau area with an elevation of 2,102 to 3,206 m and has been completed. A total of 131 sites (density of 12.5 sites/ha) has been inventoried. These include three single component historic sites, five prehistoric/historic sites, and 123 prehistoric sites; nine of the prehistoric sites con- tained ceramics. Functional categories of the sites in- clude: limited activity (tool manufacture and use), hunting (staging and butchering), temporary camps, probable fall/winter pinyon camps, structural (cliff- dwelling/storage), and pictograph sites. Carl Halbirt and Clara Gualtieri [Museum of Northern Arizona (MNA)] have completed an ar- chaeological survey of 2,965 ha in the Alton Lease- hold, southwestern Utah, for Utah International, Inc. A total of 107 limited activity sites were recorded. Archaic through Southern Paiute occupations are recognized from diagnostic ceramics and projectile points. Archaic sites are primarily located in diverse, rugged terrain, while Southern Paiute sites are situated in areas of low relief. The technological adaptation from the atlatl to the bow-and-arrow is assumed to be the causal mechanism behind this distribution. Ethnographic accounts for the area in- dicate the sites were probably related to seasonal summer-fall hunting-gathering activities. TEXAS. Two excavation reports have been pub- lished by the Archaeology Laboratory (Texas-El Paso) with Rex E. Gerald (UTEP) as Principal Investi- gator and Thomas C. O'Laughlin (UTEP) as Project Archaeologist. One covers the test excavation at a large Archaic site (2500-1800 B.C.) located in west El Paso on an alluvial fan at the edge of the Rio Grande floodplain. At least 23 circular, mud- covered, brush dwellings were identified, and a variety of charred wild plant foods were recovered from one of them. The second report describes the ar- tifacts found at a number of fire-cracked hearths located on an alluvial fan in east El Paso. No animal bones were encountered, but charred plant remains were found, including a kernel of corn from a hearth dated at A.D. 140 to 650. In both of these studies the food and lithic resources available within the vicinity of the sites were considered as well as the place of each site in the seasonal exploitative activities of the prehistoric occupants. Two intensive surveys covering some 500 km2 in extreme west Texas have been completed recently and published by the Archaeology Laboratory (UTEP) with Rex E. Gerald as Principal Investigator and Michael E. Whalen as the Project Archaeologist. Ar- chaic and Mesilla phase sites were widely scattered over the Hueco Bolson. El Paso phase sites were con- centrated on an alluvial zone on the east side of the Bolson and on sand ridges near depressions on the west side. Wild plant resources and horticultural potential seem to have been principal determinants of site locations. COLORADO. The Dolores Archaeological Proj- ect (Colorado) conducted its third field season in 1980. Thirty-four sites in the McPhee Reservoir pool area were tested, and an additional 14 sites received more intensive investigation. The sites ranged in time from probable Archaic through Historic. Primary ef- fort involved excavations at four Pueblo I villages/ communities. Although these site clusters are at least in part contemporary, each contains elements that reflect relationships (contact?-origins?) with dif- ferent portions of the northern San Juan area, based on variation in ceramic frequencies and on minor ar- chitectural features. Jerry Fetterman and Linda Honeycutt (U Colorado) conducted survey and excavations along the 102 miles of MAPCO Pipeline. A total of 131 sites were located, 25 of which, mostly BMIII and PI, were in- vestigated. A significant correlation was noted be- tween Anasazi habitations and arable loess lands in the Montezuma Valley and between Pueblo habita- tions and permanent water in the Durango area. Three Basketmaker sites near Dove Creek are the northernmost Basketmaker sites excavated in the Northern San Juan Region. E. Charles Adams and Steve Dosh (MNA) directed stabilization work to repair masonry damaged by severe winter storms at Escalante and Lowry Ruins, near Cortes, both of which had been previously ex- cavated and stabilized. A report based on this work discusses the restabilization of areas (capped walls, room walls, kiva bench, kiva floor drainage system) through careful restructuring of stonework and ap- plication of properly colored mortar. A Class III Inventory Survey of 2,270 ha has been completed as part of the Animas-La Plata Irrigation Project for the U.S. Water and Power Resources Ser- vice. The survey, directed by John Ware (OCA), was located in the Ridges Basin area southwest of Durango. A total of 200 sites were recorded, which include: 63 Late BMIII/Early PI habitation sites, 20 Archaic and BMII lithic sites, 68 small lithic and lithic/ceramic sites, and 49 historic sites comprised of homesteads, camp sites, and the town of Porter, Colorado. Joseph Winter (OCA) and William Reynolds (ESCA-Tech) were Principal Investigators. Work conducted during the spring of 1981 includes a proton-magnetometer survey of 30 sites and the test excavation of 10 sites. A clearance survey of 243 ha was conducted in the Navajo State Recreation Area. Joseph Winter (OCA) and William Reynolds (ESCA-Tech) served as Prin- cipal Investigators; John Miller (OCA) was Field Director. The survey located six prehistoric sites, one historic Anglo site, two localities, and ten isolated oc- currences. The prehistoric sites date to the Rosa, Piedra, or Arboles Phases and consist of small lithic and/or sherd scatters. William Reynolds (ESCA-Tech) and Meade Kemrer (ESCA-Tech) are serving as Principal Investigators on a Class II inventory using simulation to predict the number and type of cultural resources within the area of impact of the proposed Animas-La Plata proj- ect, followed by an on-the-ground inventory. Since 1978, Centuries Research, Inc. has been con- ducting surveys and excavation in direct and indirect impact areas for the Mount Emmons Project of 932 [Vol. 46, No. 4, 1981]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH AMAX, Inc. in the Upper Gunnison Basin of west- central Colorado. A 100% inventory of direct impact areas involved 10,374 ha ranging in elevation from 2,408 and 3,170 m. Eighty-four aboriginal sites, most- ly lithic scatters, and 259 aboriginal isolated finds were recorded. The historic Euro-American occupa- tion is represented by 43 sites. Test excavations were conducted at twenty-one aboriginal and Euro-American sites located in the Alkali Creek study area. In addi- tion, a 25% sample survey was conducted in two in- direct impact areas that will serve as major trans- portation corridors to the development. Over 125 Historic period sites were recorded in the corridors. Research is focused on high altitude adaptations in the Southern Rocky Mountains. Howard J. Pomerantz (Colorado Preservation Of- fice) has been excavating what appears to be a late paleo-Indian or Early Archaic campsite discovered during expansion activities at the Morgan County Landfill, approximately eight km northeast of Fort Morgan, Colorado. No diagnostics have been dis- covered at this site, situated in a dunal environment. The 10-cm thick occupation level was uncovered 10 m below the present ground surface and consists of a number of rock-rimmed hearths containing ash and charcoal, fire-cracked rock, and some fire-cracked manos. Two debitage concentrations were discov- ered in close association with two of the hearth features. In the immediate vicinity of the hearths were found numerous fragmentary and whole bones, tentatively identified as being B. bison bison, B. bison occidentalis, Antilocapra americana, and Perog- nathus sp. The identification of B. b. occidentalis is based on a single radius and is therefore suspect. Materials have been submitted for C-14 and thermo- luminescent dating. NORTHWEST MEXICO. Julian D. Hayden and Michael R. Waters have secured samples of food shell (chione) from occupied aeolian dunes flanking a long-extinct estuary of the Bay of Adair. The site is located at the upper end of the Gulf of California, west of the Sierra Pinacate, in northwest Sonora. The dunes are armored with a pavement of grey, eroded food shell identical in appearance to that found in association with Malpais phase tools of the San Dieguito Complex in the Sierra. These tools are thought to be in excess of 20,000 years of age. The upper sample of chione shell, 10 cm below the pave- ment, was in clean, loose sand. The lower sample, at 20 cm depth, was in a paleosol of brown, caliche- bearing decayed sand, and the shell was partially rotted and caliche-encased. Both samples (GX-7022 and GX-7023) were in excess of 37,000 years B.P. and may be much older. A third sample of white pecten from loose sand between dunes yielded an age of 10,880 ? 240 C-14 years B.P. (GX-7024). ARIZONA. The Black Mesa Archaeological Proj- ect is continuing reconnaissance and excavations in northeastern Arizona. The project, sponsored by Peabody Coal Company and directed by George J. Gumerman and Shirley Powell (U Carbondale), will excavate approximately 25 Anasazi sites (BMII-PII- III) during the 1981 field season. Approximately 150 Navajo sites dating from ca. 1860 to the present will be mapped and surface collected. Continuing re- search focuses on clarifying prehistoric economic and organizational responses to a marginal and highly unpredictable environment. Navajo site data are being used to investigate patterns of human mobility and the changing role of pastoralism relative to all Navajo economic activities. Patterns of Navajo wood use and the effects of these behaviors on the in- terpretation of tree-ring dates also are being studied by Jeffrey Dean (Arizona). Specialized analyses being performed with data collected from Black Mesa in- clude on-site and environmental macrofloral identi- fication (under the direction of Richard I. Ford, Michigan), pollen analyses (Robert Murry, Texas A &amp; M), human osteological remains (George Armelagos, Debra Martin, Alan Swedlund, Massachu- setts-Amherst), and faunal analysis (Michele Seme, Southern Illinois U). Donald E. Weaver, Jr. (MNA) is conducting an in- tensive study of the ancestral Hopi site of Homolovi II and associated petroglyphs, located near Winslow, in the Little Colorado valley. Funded by the Museum of Northern Arizona and the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office, the study involves detailed map- ping and controlled surface collections of the 700 + room pueblo, surveying a large surrounding area for associated features and sites, and detailed recording of the hundreds of associated petroglyphs. The final report will include a long-range plan for study and development of the site. A BIA-sponsored sample survey of the Bosque, Waterman and Vekol valleys south of Phoenix has been completed by Robert Gasser (MNA). The project involved intensive inspection of 171 forty-acre parcels (2769 ha, a five percent areal sample). A total of 27 sites were recorded, 25 of them in the Vekol area. The analysis centered around patterns of site distribution, associations between environmental variables (water, wild plant foods, agricultural potential) and site distributions, and the edge effects of the nearby densely occupied Gila River Valley. Richard Ciolek-Torrello (MNA) completed an inten- sive survey of 22 km2 of ponderosa pine forest in the Pinedale Ranger District of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests as a result of the proposed Stott Timber Sale. The 61 sites located include 19 pre- historic habitation, 37 prehistoric limited activity areas, and five historic sites. Prehistoric sites span the eleventh and thirteenth centuries with the greatest occupation in the twelfth century. Habita- tion sites include pithouse structures and a few five- to 15-room masonry roomblocks. Low walled masonry and jacal structures, often referred to as "carport" sites, were the most common. The historic sites, all twentieth century, consist of sheep-herder camps, a sweat lodge, and a wickiup. The historic Crook's Trail also passed through the area, although no indications of the road were observed. A draft report on the Navajo sites investigated along the Salt River Project Coal-Haul Electric-Over- head Railroad from Page to Navajo National Monu- ment has been completed by Sara Stebbins (MNA). 933</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Data from the 48 historic Navajo sites of varying sizes and functions suggest confirmation of the hogan types and corresponding dates implied by Harris and Jett. The report is a complement to Jeanne Swarth- out's (MNA) report on the prehistoric sites along the same route. The field testing of a portion of the right-of-way for the proposed I-10, Papago Freeway Inner Loop, has been completed by Ronald K. Yablon (MNA), and con- sisted of systematic trenching at a 1% intensity level. A segment of the right-of-way crosses the extreme eastern edge of the La Ciudad archaeological site. Located prehistoric features included seven pit- houses, two canals, two cremations, and a burial. Ar- tifact analysis (prehistoric and historic) is in prog- ress, as are flotation, pollen, and faunal analyses. Approximately one-third of the test area was sur- veyed with the use of a ground penetrating radar system. The analyses of the radar data are nearing completion. Robert Coody (MNA) and Beth Gibson, former con- servator of archaeological and ethnographic objects at the Smithsonian Institution, are presently working on a National Science Foundation grant for the con- servation of the prehistoric human skeletal material at the Museum of Northern Arizona. This collection is one of the largest in the Southwest and represents nearly a millennium of human biological and cultural development on the Colorado Plateau. Conservation, stabilization, and restoration of the material using polyvinyl acetate is underway. J. Richard Ambler (Northern Arizona U) directed the excavation of an early Tsegi Phase (ca. A.D. 1240-1260) pithouse near Shonto Junction, north- eastern Arizona. On the floor were two rare vessel forms, a bird effigy vessel, and a colander. Two canine burials were in the lower fill. Activities related to specialized crafts (weaving) and others related to ceremonial functions are inferred from a series of loom holes in the floor, a high percentage of Ephedra pollen, and associated artifacts. A survey of portions of Dzil Nez Mesa and Paiute Canyon along the Arizona-Utah border was initiated by J. Richard Ambler (Northern Arizona U). The survey was designed to gather data from both upland and canyon sites near Navajo Mountain. Populations in the well watered and densely occupied canyon ap- pear to have remained more stable than those in the uplands, where population fluctuations appear to closely mirror climatic changes. Ceramic analysis has revealed some aberrant design styles on sherds from Pueblo II sites. Linda Kelley (Northern Arizona U) collected and tested a tool manufacturing site near Kinlichee, Arizona, a locus that appears associated with the BM II occupation of the Pueblo Colorado Wash area. Phil Geib (NAU) directed work at an apparently Archaic site near Tohatchi, New Mexico. Both sites were threatened by construction activities. Robert C. Euler (Grand Canyon National Park) sur- veyed on the North Rim of Grand Canyon, testing the hypotheses that (1) the Kayenta Anasazi occupied sites on the Rim where there was access to the Inner Canyon, (2) primary orientation of sites lay to the in- ner canyon rather than to areas north of the Rim, and (3) pueblo structures were confined to the P. ponderosa and P. edulis-J. utahensis vegetation zones. Of approximately 50 PII sites recorded, all were in those vegetation zones and all but one were situated where routes off the Rim provided access to the Esplanade below. Under the direction of Glen Rice the Office of Cul- tural Resource Management at Arizona State Univer- sity has conducted field surveys at six different localities surrounding the Hohokam core area in cen- tral Arizona. These localities are being considered as alternate locations for flood control and water storage for the Phoenix Metropolitan area and in- clude portions of the Agua Fria, Gila, Salt, and Verde rivers. A total of 326 new sites have been identified, and 41 previously recorded sites along the Gila River have been revisited. Survey procedures have includ- ed the collection of surface materials. As a result it has been possible to examine intersettlement rela- tionships on the Hohokam periphery. Ceramic analyses by Shereen Lerner (ASU) suggest that cer- tain large sites served as gateway communities that controlled the exchange of resources between upland areas and the major trade corridors along the river valleys. It has been posited that such communi- ties served as a means of redistributing natural resources from the periphery in exchange for culti- vated resources from the Hohokam core area. Tech- nological analysis of the lithic materials, performed by Rachel Most (ASU), allows differentiation of habitation sites from more specialized sites by trac- ing the reduction sequence of locally produced raw materials. Glen Rice and Gary Feinman (ASU) are investi- gating the organization of activity areas at two pre- historic sites along Oraibi Wash on the Hopi Reser- vation. The focus of research involves the examina- tion of differences in economic activities and status. The proposition that kivas may have been involved in redistribution is being investigated for the P II occu- pation, and a related question concerns the relative importance of agricultural and wild resources at dif- ferent settlements in the area. Fieldwork at these sites has included a magnetometer study which was employed to detect deeply buried sites located under sand dunes. Research at six historical sites (five Apache and one a part of Fort Apache) on the White Mountain In- dian Reservation of Arizona has recently been com- pleted by Jeanette A. McKenna and Glen E. Rice (ASU). The study focused on dating (the sites were largely contemporaneous, dating to the turn of the century), functional variability and patterns of ar- tifact reuse. The researchers were able to differen- tiate sites with ceremonial, habitation, and limited activity purposes on the basis of analyses of artifact function and descriptions of site functions from Apache consultants. Elinor Large (ASU) is preparing the final report on the archaeological investigations carried out in 1977 on the northern periphery of La Ciudad de Los Hor- nos. The nature of the relationship between surface materials and the subsurface archaeological 934 [Vol. 46, No. 4,1981]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH deposits in a plowed field was investigated through surface sampling, stripping of the plow zone, and trenching. Analysis was conducted using the compu- terized SYMAP mapping program. Intact archaeolog- ical features dating primarily to the Gila Butte and Santa Cruz phases, but including a Classic period cache, were found below the plow zone some 400 m north of the known Classic period mound at Los Hor- nos. Between 20 and 30 pit ovens were located within approximately a four-ha area. Pollen and flotation analyses from five excavated ovens indicate that they were used for pit-roasting wild vegetable foods (such as cholla buds). The high frequency of these ovens at Los Hornos suggests a much greater reliance on gathered foods than has been tradition- ally assumed, which may indicate that the Hohokam irrigation system was involved in the production of some nonfood items, such as cotton. Students enrolled in the ASU spring field school worked at the Hohokam sites of La Ciudad and Las Canopas. Work at La Ciudad was undertaken because of imminent destruction of a portion of that site by hospital construction. The disturbed upper deposits of the site were underlain by relatively un- disturbed historic deposits and undisturbed prehistoric deposits. Artifactual materials in the historic strata were left during occupation of the nearby St. Luke's Sanitarium during the early twen- tieth century and should be useful in describing western medical practices. Prehistoric features, some of which were not previously known in the Salt River Valley, included burials, house floors, and deeply stratified trash pits. The data will provide valuable information on patterns of culture change during the Sedentary, Colonial, and Classic periods of Hohokam occupation of the Salt River Valley. Archaeological research at Nuvaqueotaka (Chavez Pass' under the direction of Charles Merbs and Fred Plog (ASUJ) continued. Survey work focused on expan- sion of the contiguous area around the main ruin and development of a sample of surrounding areas. Earlier sites not previously known and new types of water control features were located. Excavation focused on understanding stratigraphy in functional- ly different areas of the site. Evidence of a plaza- workshop area that involved the use of a complex ar- ray of pits heated to very high temperatures was developed. Excavation in the northern room block suggests that walls visible on the surface of this site are part of a large set of stepped terraces rather than rooms. A long-term development program for tourism, pro- tection and/or development of archaeological and historic sites, and conservation of tribal heritage has been initiated by the Gila River Indian Community. ASU has undertaken a cultural resource inventory program under the direction of Dr. A. E. Dittert, Jr., with the assistance of Owen Lindauer, Scott Fedick, and Nancy Coinman. Because of the large sizes of the sites encountered, sampling methods for both inter- site and intrasite definitions were developed. Analyses include the definition of the range of ceramic types, computer-generated maps for the prediction of subsurface cultural features, and a soil nutrient analysis to detect subsurface cultural features. Chad T. Phinney, Gina Laczko, Roy L. Pettyjohn, and Roger W. Lidman (Pueblo Grande Museum) are preparing an overview of all excavation and survey work done at Pueblo Grande in 1929, 1934-1938 and 1966-1981, one of the last platform-mounded Hohokam sites remaining in the Salt River Valley. In September 1980, Marsha Cosentino, David Stephen, and James Hewitt (Pima Community Col- lege) completed an intensive archaeological survey of the old Midvale Farms in Tucson for the Estes Com- pany. Two Mexican rancheria sites with stone struc- ture foundations dating to the late 1800s were located on land owned by pioneer Tucsonans. Excava- tion and ethnohistoric research is concerned with the adaptation of small farming/ranching settlements to changing social conditions at a time when the cessa- tion of Apache hostilities and the coming of the Southern Pacific line opened up the area to Anglo- American development. An ongoing six-year archaeological survey of the Tortolita Mountains region near Tucson, directed by James Hewitt and David Stephen (Pima Community College), has located numerous Hohokam town type communities and resource utilization sites, dating primarily to the Classic period (A.D. 1200-1500). Of interest is a possible calendrical site, Zodiac Ridge, with numerous sun, moon, and star stone alignments. Research problems are concerned with the adapta- tion of Hohokam villagers to nonriverine environ- ments, as well as the evolution of nucleated towns during a period of widespread Salado influence in southern Arizona. Wirth Associates' San Diego Office has conducted archaeological, historic, and ethnographic studies as part of the APS/SDG&amp;E Interconnection Project Transmission Line study, including about 1,609 km of alternative corridors and extending from west of Phoenix to San Diego. A sensitivity model was devel- oped to identify expected prehistoric site distribu- tions using existing data, projections regarding past environments, and new data collected during a 25% sample survey. The study also records known signi- ficant or sensitive historic sites in the study area, and Native Americans were consulted regarding ethno- graphic sites of sacred/social importance. Claudia F. Berry (Northland Anthropological Re- search, Inc.) conducted an intensive survey of all undeveloped lands on the Ak-Chin Indian Reservation prior to their development as irrigated farmlands. Over 60 archaeological sites were recorded; these have been identified as Hohokam (late Pioneer- Sedentary) and historic Pima-Papago. Research has focused on the chronology and nature of settlement along the Vekol Wash distributary system, a complex network of channels and floodplain along which most of the sites are situated. The lack of both Classic period Hohokam sites and protohistoric remains are of particular significance. The possible presence of a mid-nineteenth century occupation of the area, before the introduction of large quantities of Euro- pean goods, provides considerable potential for the study of a poorly known period in this region. 935</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Boma Johnson (BLM, Yuma) has been involved in ongoing field inventory and research on the desert gravel figures and ceremonial dance paths located on the gravel terraces in the deserts of southeastern California and southwestern and western Arizona, especially in the Lower Colorado and Gila River drainage basins. Thus far, these gravel figures, unique to southwestern deserts of North America, are seen as representations of human and animal figures, geometric designs, and patterns in the gravel surfaces created by ceremonial dance activities. More than 100 are known in the study area. While there is no certain way to date these figures, style, site associations and ethnographic descriptions of aboriginal ceremonials suggest a chronological cor- relation for some with recent indigenous peoples (i.e., Mohave and Quechan), while others relate to the San Dieguito culture (9000-5000 B.C.). Gay M. Kinkade and Craig Bromley (BLM, Safford) directed Class III intensive field inventories of the proposed Tanque Detention Dam on the lower San Simon River and the proposed Slick Rock Wash Detention Dam on a tributary of the San Simon River- Although no significant cultural resource remains were discovered on the Slick Rock Wash project, numerous late Mogollon sites were discovered in the Tanque project area. These include plant collecting and processing loci on the floodplain and small food processing and temporary or seasonal habitation sites on the low terrace tops. Survey by Paul R. Fish and Suzanne K. Fish (Arizona State Museum) continues in the Sacred Mountain area of the Verde Valley, central Arizona, which is within the Coconino National Forest. Ap- proximately 5.2 km2 of the basin were intensively surveyed, with a variety of agricultural features recorded. With the cooperation of the Forest and the use of Youth Conservation Corps labor, experimental terraces were constructed to evaluate labor invest- ment and slope modification. Research focuses on population dynamics and agricultural development. Investigations, directed by Paul R. Fish and Richard C. Lange (ASM) and sponsored by the Museum, con- tinue at Los Morteros, a major Hohokam town in the Tucson Basin. While long-term research efforts in- volve the examination of the structure of a Hohokam town, more immediate goals have related to a study of formation processes through the well-controlled ex- cavation of several pithouses and a determination of trincheras function by excavation and detailed map- ping. Richard C. Lange and John H. Madsen (ASM) con- ducted 117 surveys covering nearly 3,240 ha on lands owned by the State of Arizona. A wide variety of sites located in many parts of the state were identi- fied through this work. Two early and very large Mogollon pithouse villages on the Upper Gila were among the more significant sites located. Both were threatened by the proposed relocation of the city of Duncan for flood protection. Limited test excavations were conducted and a detailed mitigation plan for the two sites was prepared by Phil Chase and Chester Shaw (ASM). Sharon Urban (ASM) has conducted field checks for all project sites announced in the A95 review pro- cess for the Tucson area, to provide a basis for Museum comments, assess the extent of prereview project-related ground disturbance and to evaluate the rate of site loss to urban development. Local chapters of the Arizona Archaeological Society were encouraged to make similar checks in other parts of the state. Today, nearly all A95 announcements in- volving ground disturbance in Arizona receive field evaluation. Henry Wallace and Jim Holmlund (U Arizona) con- ducted an intensive survey of Rillito Peak which was initially stimulated by a small Arizona Department of Transportation contract. A report describing and in- terpreting several hundred bedrock mortar, petro- glyph, and trincheras localities will soon be pub- lished. The Navajo Nation Cultural Resource Manage- ment Program (NNCRMP), under the direction of David E. Doyel and Laurel Grove, has conducted work on a variety of projects in Tribal Lands in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah in 1980 and 1981. The projects range in size from less than .4 ha to several hundred hectares. A large variety of sites, from Archaic camps to Chacoan outlier communities to Navajo rock art have been recorded by these surveys. In Arizona, work on the Pinon Road Project has continued under the direction of Laurance D. Linford (NNCRMP). A total of 40 sites have been tested or ex- cavated during the two field seasons. The materials recovered date to the BMI II through P III periods. The project is located on Black Mesa, and the results in- tegrate well with the findings from Southern Illinois University's work there. Historic Navajo materials from 32 sites are being analyzed by Scott Russell (ASU) in a study of the effects of economic changes on Navajo life during this century. Laurie Warner (NNCRMP) excavated a site in Window Rock, consisting of two pithouses and a ramada. This small site is apparently a seasonal camp of the P I-II transition period. No other sites of this time period have been recorded in the immediate area, and analysis is in part focused on the source areas from which site inhabitants originated. Teri Cleeland (NNCRMP) surveyed in the area of forested uplands west of Window Rock, Arizona and recorded 50 Navajo sites, most dating to the twen- tieth century. In order to comply with the recent Native American Religious Freedom Act, a medicine man was consulted to assess the sacred significance of these sites and to aid in the interpretation of the materials. With this survey and another by Laurence D. Linford (NNCRMP), a total of 12,158 ha of high pine forest area on and around the Defiance Plateau have been surveyed. NEW MEXICO. In New Mexico, David E. Doyel (NNCRMP) is overseeing a major project on the Gallo Wash Lease, near Chaco Canyon. A total of 30 sites, ranging from Archaic to P II/III, will have been ex- cavated or tested during the two years of fieldwork. Alan H. Simmons and Lawrence E. Vogler (NNCRMP), working further north, utilize variations 936 [Vol. 46, No. 4, 19811</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH of Jochim's cultural ecological model for Archaic sites. Studies of community patterning are being em- phasized on the Anasazi sites. Michael P. Marshall (NNCRMP) is investigating and stabilizing the Cha- coan outlier of Bis'sa'ani, an impressive ruin con- sisting of an adobe pueblo and masonry kivas. Ethno- historic research by Klara Kelly (NNCRMP) em- phasizes patterns of economic subsistences, contrast- ing the Navajo and Anglo-American organization of sheep herding. Linda Popelish (NNCRMP) surveyed several areas in the Black Creek drainage which are scheduled for range improvement, or have been subject to various impacts, including chaining. In an area near a Cha- coan outlier, an unusually high density of sites was recorded, most dating to P II. The relationship be- tween these sites and the apparent cultural bounda- ries in the vicinity is a major topic in the forthcoming report. Research on the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project between Chaco Canyon and Farmington, under the direction of Lawrence E. Vogler (NNCRMP), has sur- veyed several blocks on 46,600 ha, recording over 1,000 sites. Excavations are continuing during 1981. Cultural ecological models are being used to inter- pret the Archaic horizons, while site catchments for 13 Archaic, 2 Anasazi, and 7 Navajo sites are being analyzed by Terry Del Bene (NNCRMP) for the same project. In order to clear the way for a planned high school in Navajo, New Mexico, Russell T. Fehr (NNCRMP) conducted investigations at a site with components dating from Archaic to historic Navajo. Mike Andrews (Northern Arizona University) has completed a survey of more than 130 km of pipeline right-of-way in the Sanostee and Tocito drainages of the western Chuska Valley, New Mexico. As a result of the survey, 155 sites, ranging in age from BM III through late P III, and historic Navajo from about AD 1750 to present, were recorded. Several very large BM III villages and one defensive P III community (ca. A.D. 1250-1300) were recorded. In addition, An- drews supervised the surface collection and testing at two of the Basketmaker sites. The University of New Mexico (UNM) field school, under the direction of Linda S. Cordell, conducted survey and excavation as part of the Rowe Pueblo Archaeological Project, a cooperative effort involv- ing the participation of Walter K. Wait and Larry Nordby (National Park Service), the Sandoval family (landowners), field school students, and staff. Partial funding was obtained by a grant from NHC to Dr. Wait. Rowe Pueblo, first investigated by Carle Guthe, has been considered a pure Coalition period site ancestral to Pecos Pueblo. It contains more than one masonry component, and current work reveals an ad- ditional underlying adobe structure. Tree-ring and archaeomagnetic samples date the final masonry ruin to post A.D. 1340, contemporary with the early settlement at Pecos Pueblo. More than 7,000 animal bones were recovered during excavation. Prelimi- nary analyses of these by Martha Binford (UNM) sug- gest an unusually high frequency of mid- to large-size game. Rowe Pueblo yielded lithics of diverse material types. Sources for these, and chipping stations, were located in the Pecos River gravels by survey crews led by Kurt Anscheutz (UNM). The reduction technol- ogy is being studied by Anscheutz and John Acklen (UNM). Ceramic analyses by Carol Raish (UNM), in- cluding petrographic studies by Elizabeth Garrett, in- dicate a predominantly local industry. The dating and subsidiary analyses of materials from Rowe Pueblo should provide a baseline for a reevaluation of the later prehistory of the Upper Pecos Valley. Vorsila L. Bohrer (Eastern New Mexico University) has resumed analysis of the excellently preserved plant remains from Fresnal Shelter, an Archaic site in south-central New Mexico, to reveal subsistence patterns. Uniform volumes of plant material from 10 flotation samples from natural strata and pits were analyzed for taxa present. Forty-four screened strata of variable volume were also analyzed for taxa pres- ent. Eleven subsistence items occurred in 80% of the flotation samples. Ten grow as perennials, five ex- hibit a long season of availability, and three mature reliably in season. Food stored on the plant (roots, clinging fruits, cactus stems) was apparently as much valued as food stored in the shelter (seeds). Maize was present in half the samples. The analysis and write-up phase of the Chaco Center (W. James Judge, Director) approaches its conclusion. In August 1981 a number of projects and reports were completed and will be published over the next four years. Since much of the recently com- pleted research may be of immediate interest to Southwestern archaeologists, reports awaiting NPS publication are summarized here. Site reports were prepared by Marcia Truell, Thomas Windes, and Peter McKenna. Seven smaller sites, ranging in time from BM III to P III, were docu- mented in relatively short reports, while larger ex- cavations and longer reports were required for two important small sites (Truell and McKenna), and Pueblo Alto (Windes). A report on excavations at Una Vida was also prepared by Nancy Akins and William Gillespie. Marcia Truell prepared an interpretive summary of the archaeology of the smaller sites in Chaco Can- yon, synthesizing earlier NPS and UNM excavations as well as the Chaco Center's work. The report defines architectural continuity in the Canyon lasting up to the Bonito phase, with increased formal diversi- ty at small sites during and after that period. Exca- vated materials suggest a higher level of interaction between small and large sites than was previously thought. Stephen Lekson completed a comparable study of the Bonito phase architecture in the Canyon. This report, together with the Pueblo Alto report (Windes), serves as an interpretive summary of the ar- chaeology of the larger Chaco sites. Ceramics. Approximately 235,000 ceramic sherds, analyzed by Peter McKenna, Wolky Toll, and Thomas Windes, were sorted into standard South- western types and used to define ceramic assem- blages (Windes). About 600 absolute dates were inte- grated with these ceramic data, and the resulting ceramic sequence tested against known strati- 937</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY graphic series at various sites. A 10% sample (mainly nonredundant rim sherds) was examined for temper- ing material (Toll) and vessel form and design (McKenna). These attribute studies allowed estima- tion of magnitude and pattern of trade (particularly from the Red Mesa, Chuska, and San Juan River valleys) and the definition of formal/functional varia- tion of ceramics within the canyon (e.g., the demon- stration of differing vessel form assemblages at con- temporaneous large and small sites). Windes and McKenna also analyzed data from extensive whole vessel collections, notably the 2,500 vessels from the Manuelito area in the Museum of Man (San Diego) collections, which with the Chaco materials allowed quantified refinement of Cibola series types (McKen- na). Chipped stone. Chipped stone analysis was directed by Catherine Cameron and included an analysis of projectile points by Stephen Lekson. Thirty-six thousand chipped stone artifacts were sorted into basic artifact types and raw material types (originally developed by A. H. Warren for the Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe). Raw material data were used to quantify extensive trade in lithic raw materials, especially in Washington Pass chert, Morrison formation chert, Zuni silicified wood, an unnamed yellow-brown spotted chert from the Zuni area, and four major sources of obsidian. A 10% sample of flakes (including all retouched flakes) was examined in detailed anlaysis of formal, technolog- ical, and functional attributes. Seven hundred cores and an augmented sample of about 1,800 projectile points and knives were similarly treated. These analyses allowed quantified description of the marked temporal variation in tool form and raw material use in the Canyon. Ground stone. John Schelberg and Catherine Cameron analyzed 1,200 metates and an equal number of manos. Formal and functional attributes were recorded, but factors of curation, modification, and reuse were also considered, particularly in the case of metates (Schelberg) and interpretation of motor patterns and degree of use in manos (Cameron). Nancy Akins analyzed 2,600 abraders of a wide variety of functional types, and Robert Powers analyzed about 1,000 residual ground stone artifacts, such as door slabs, pot lids, and the like. Minerals/ornaments. Over 7,000 mineral specimens (about 50% used in ornaments) were analyzed by Joan Mathien. Mathien quantified tem- poral change in use of local and imported materials and identified mineral processing and workshop areas at Chaco sites. Human and animal bone. Nancy Akins and William Gillespie analyzed and identified 60,000 animal bones for this project, addressing such ques- tions as changing patterns of resource exploitation (demonstrating shifts in artiodactyls exploited in pre- Bonito phase and Bonito phase strategies) and en- vironmental correlates of faunal assemblages. Akins also analyzed about 150 human burials, with a com- puterized analysis of mortuary practices, a cranio- metric study, and (with Wolky Toll) a study of path- ologies. Environment and subsistence. Several studies of subsistence and past environment were undertaken and compiled by William Gillespie, including recon- struction of the past environment (which indicates close similarity between the present and Anasazi period climates, and a warmer Archaic period climate), critical re-examination (including hydro- logic modeling) of water control at Chaco, and reconstruction of subsistence strategies. David Love (University of New Mexico) studied the Quaternary history of Chaco Arroyo, Martin Rose (University of Arizona) provided detailed dendroclimatic recon- structions of the Four Corners area, and Julio Betan- court and Thomas VanDevender (University of Arizona) analyzed faunal and macrobotanical re- mains from fossil pack rat middens. Botanical studies. Botanical reports were pre- pared by Ann Cully, Mollie Toll, and Karen Clary (Ethnobotany Lab, U New Mexico) and included exam- ination of flotation and macrobotanical remains to document variability in utilization of cultivated and wild taxa (Toll); examination of faunal, macrobotani- cal and palynological remains from coprolites to elucidate subsistence strategies (Clary); and com- parative palynological analysis of small and large sites coupled with a study of variability of abundance of modern Chaco plant communities to clarify the ob- served variation in botanical remains at those sites (Cully). Curation. Curation of archival materials and ar- tifacts was the responsibility of Thomas Windes and Catherine Ross. Over 10,000 pages of field notes and nearly 3,000 maps and profiles were organized and catalogued (Windes). Over 20,000 photographs and other archival materials were accessioned and filed (Ross). The 430,000 artifacts and other samples recovered during the field phase of the project are being processed and accessioned under the supervi- sion of Windes. These materials are now available for the use of other researchers. Cultural resource management. Robert Powers completed a report on Chacoan outlier communities and began fieldwork required by recently passed legislation changing the Monument to Chaco Culture Historical Park. This work will aid in the develop- ment of a regional cultural resource management plan for northwest New Mexico. A management plan for Chaco Canyon proper is being developed from work done by Joan Mathien and John Schelberg, with the aid of a computerized site data base with graphic output and a number of ecologic overlays. This data base will be used by Schelberg in a detailed settle- ment pattern analysis, concentrating on change in site locations and functions through time. Emphasis will be given to ecological variation and the articula- tion of settlement patterns in the Canyon with settle- ment patterns in the surrounding region. Regge N. Wiseman (Museum of New Mexico- MNM) recently conducted limited emergency exca- vations at the Rocky Arroyo Site situated in the Rio Hondo floodplain southwest of Roswell, New Mexico. The work has revealed a heavy prehistoric reliance on bison, fish, and corn by pithouse inhabitants. The site dates to the early fourteenth century and ap- 938 [Vol. 46, No. 4, 19811</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH pears referable to the Glencoe Phase of the Jornada Mogollon. An intensive testing and survey program along U.S. 70 in the Tularosa Basin was undertaken by Yvonne Oakes (MNM). Twelve lithic and/or sherd localities were tested and point provenience of the material was taken; hearths, roasting pits, ground stone, and a possible structure also were recorded. The sites date from Archaic through the pithouse (Mesilla) periods, and are presently being investi- gated in terms of task-specific activities, such as plant processing. Radiocarbon, ethnobotanical, and palynological samples collected should provide much-needed data for refining local and regional parameters and subsistence resource information. Steven Koczan and William Doleman (MNM) are completing the report of excavations at a series of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century refuse deposits in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The studies are directed toward consumption and discard patterns of different socioeconomic levels of this rapidly devel- oped urban railroad community, as they relate to known historical and economic phases in Las Vegas. The materials include debris from Fred Harvey din- ing rooms and railroad diners, as well as household and commercial refuse. The Little Water project, under the direction of Glenn Condon (MNM), excavated a San Jose (Ar- chaic) lithic site, a large BM III village, and a small P I-II field house. Research focuses on the possible buffering responses to stress adopted by local groups through time in the face of documented climatic and possible population stress in the region. The BM III village has produced tree-ring and archaeomagnetic dates which place its occupation during the period A.D. 645-830. An ubiquitous and unusual hearth form at the village is believed to represent pottery firing: the field house data suggest a limited range of ac- tivities directed primarily toward initial reduction of bulk plant foods (corn). Three recent surveys of the Center for Anthropo- logical Studies (CAS) have resulted in the intensive archaeological examination of three distinct environ- mental portions of the Llano de Albuquerque. As supervised and reported by James B. Rodgers (CAS), the first of these was a 1,751-ha project across Ceja Mesa. Only four sites were found, but an innovative system was employed to record and collect the 2,070 artifacts that were located at 802 nonsite loci. One of the prehistoric sites and most of the isolated artifacts represent extensive Oshara Archaic activity of the 800 B.C.-A.D. 1 period. The two remaining prehis- toric sites denote religious and agricultural use of the Llano by A.D. 1325-1425 period Rio Grande Anasazi. The only historic project site documents re- cent (1917-1925) sheepherding west of the Albu- querque volcanoes. Archaeological research of an eastern 1,276-ha portion of the Llano de Albuquerque has been reported by Hayward H. Franklin (CAS). Information was obtained from 775 isolated artifactual loci and 29 prehistoric sites. The majority of the former con- tained nondiagnostic lithics which reflect a variety of prehistoric butchering, hide processing, tool manu- facturing, and food collecting/processing activities. Eleven of the prehistoric sites relate to late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 500) subsistence activity of the Oshara. The remaining sites constitute sherd and lithic scatters, hearths, and seasonally used pit- houses of the Rio Grande Anasazi. These sites date from A.D. 500 to about A.D. 1600. A 47-ha parcel of the eastern Cejita Blanca portion of the Llano de Albuquerque has been intensively surveyed and reported by James B. Rodgers (CAS). This basalt escarpment area produced seven signifi- cant archaeological sites, four of which contain ar- chitectural remnants of either sheep corrals or a shepherd camp used between 1846 and 1920. The three prehistoric sites were used by Classic period (A.D. 1325-1600) Rio Grande Anasazi for ceremonial purposes and the manufacture of stone tools. The largest of these is an extension of the Cejita Blanca site which contains thousands of Spanish, Mexican, Anglo-American, and especially Anasazi petroglyphs which, collectively, date from about A.D. 600 to 1929. Hayward H. Franklin and William R. Neal (CAS) have recently completed an intensive survey of a 518-ha portion of La Jara Mesa. A total of 42 non- sites, 3 prehistoric sites, and 8 historic sites were recorded. The prehistoric sites are all limited activity loci situated within a pinyon-juniper zone. They represent the temporary exploitation of this zone by Anasazi groups during A.D. 1050-1150. The historic sites reflect a variety of Navajo sheepherding ac- tivities undertaken between 1920 and 1950. Most of them occur adjacent to open grasslands where juniper was used to construct a total of three sheep corrals, three sweat houses, and seven hogans of either the cribbed-log or forked-stick style. James B. Rodgers, Hayward H. Franklin, and William R. Neal (CAS) have completed five intensive surveys of Kirtland Air Force Base. Collectively, 554 isolated artifactual loci, 12 prehistoric sites, and 23 historic sites were located on 2,350 ha. Archaic hunt- ing and tool manufacturing are the earliest Oshara activities, dating 500 B.C.-A.D. 1. All of the later prehistoric sites reflect the seasonal use of a sup- plementary resource zone by Rio Grande Anasazi groups, especially during late Developmental-early Classic (A.D. 1050-1350) times. The majority of the project sites, however, are historic, documenting a variety of domestic and task-specific mining activities associated with the extensive 1880-1930 mineral ex- ploitation of the Manzano Mountains. A partial synthesis of Kirtland Air Force Base ar- chaeology by James B. Rodgers (CAS) shows 26 sites and 226 isolated artifactual loci examined from seven environmental zones of an approximate 57 km2 project area. The resource variability here spans a cultural sequence of about 10,700 years and repre- sents the specialized use of specific areas by either paleo-Indian, Oshara, Rio Grande Anasazi, or historic peoples from about 8800 B.C. to A.D. 1930. Joseph C. Winter and David D. Eck (Office of Con- tract Archaeology, University of New Mexico-OCA) directed the excavation of a small shelter on Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, with funding pro- vided by the Campbell Family Foundation. Several 939</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY thousand lithic artifacts, sherds from 64 vessels, and various other materials were recovered. Features in- cluded hearths, ash pits, storage features, and scores of aeolian, alluvial, and trash lenses. Ceramics and radiocarbon dates indicate that the shelter was occupied primarily during P II times, with a short occupation by the Piro in the seven- teenth century. Ceramics suggest that the seasonal occupants were a peripheral Mogollon group that made Mogollon Brown Wares and southern Anasazi White Wares. The cave appears to have functioned as a locus for hunting, plant gathering, farming, and as a lithic workshop in P II times. It may have been used for similar purposes by the Piro, although it may also have served as a refuge in the 1600s during the Apache Wars and Pueblo Revolt. Floral and faunal remains indicate that the local plant and animal com- munities were the same in the past as today. A project involving a cultural resource overview and a 10% sample survey of 8,576 ha was conducted for the Salt River Project by Joseph Winter and Christine Allen (OCA) in the Blanco/Nageezi area of the San Juan Basin. One hundred thirty-one previ- ously recorded Anasazi and Navajo sites were noted. Thirty-two additional sites, 28 localities, and 64 isolated occurrences were recorded by the survey, which utilized randomly selected east-west running transects across the study area. An ethnographic in- terview and ethnohistoric archival program (Fred York-OCA) additionally identified 39 currently used Navajo sites, 37 allotments, and 12 grazing areas. The Anasazi sites are primarily clustered around Pierre's Site, a large Chacoan outlier, and the asso- ciated Great North Road. The sites appear to have formed a productive community that was linked to Chaco Canyon and the San Juan Valley by the road. The Archaic sites seem to be associated with vege- tation factors, while the Navajo sites are grazing related. A portion of Nuestra Sefnora de Dolores Pueblo, a large prehistoric Southern Tiwa village located near Nuestra Sefiora de Dolores church in Bernalillo, was excavated to mitigate the effects of sewage line con- struction. Under the direction of Joseph Winter and Mike Marshall (OCA), the excavated features includ- ed a large, rectangular kiva, a pitroom, several ex- terior hearths, and nineteenth- and twentieth- century trash. Although it has been assumed that the pueblo is a PV contact-era village, ceramics, archeo- magnetic, and radiocarbon samples indicate that the excavation features date to the early fifteenth cen- tury. This portion of the site represents an outlying part of a large, multicomponent Southern Tiwa village whose inhabitants depended on farming, hunting, and fishing. A project conducted as part of the environmental impact study for proposed water and sewer facilities on Crownpoint involved intensive survey of approxi- mately 40 km of right-of-ways and about 256 ha of land. In addition, a random sample of six 16-ha quadrats was surveyed in the indirect impact area. The investigation, conducted by Joseph Winter and Patrick Hogan (OCA), recorded 11 sites, 7 archaeo- logical localities, 5 isolated occurrences, and 16 cur- rent cultural manifestations during the survey. Five of the sites contained Anasazi components while the remaining sites, associated with the Navajo occupa- tion of Crownpoint during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, represent an important cultural resource for the local community. Both ar- chaeological and ethnohistoric (Fred York-OCA) documentation was provided for this period. Principal Investigators Mark Harlan and Joseph Winter (OCA) report on the following three projects. A survey of approximately 800 ha in the vicinity of Thoreau, undertaken for the Continental Oil Com- pany in connection with a proposed uranium milling site, encountered 93 sites and 27 localities. The ma- jority of the P II sites are small roomblocks of two to five rooms, while larger Puebloan sites may contain as many as 20 rooms. Both Wingate and Red Mesa Phases are represented. The historic Navajo sites ap- pear to be mainly sheep herding camps. Approximately 560 ha in the vicinity of Marquez was surveyed for the Kerr McGee Nuclear Corpora- tion in connection with a proposed uranium mine. Eleven sites and forty localities were encountered ranging from BM II to recent historic, including one small Pueblo site, one possible Navajo refuge, and possible historic Acoma-Laguna sheep camps. The use of the area by prehistoric hunters is indicated by isolated finds of projectile points. The survey of about 680 ha near Anthony, con- ducted for the Federal Aviation Administration, recorded 34 sites and 13 localities. The localities are mainly single hearths associated with limited artifact scatters. Only one site, a Jornada Mogollon site of the El Paso Phase (A.D. 1200-1400), seems to represent a substantial occupation; other sites attest to the fre- quent use of the area by small foraging parties. Site visibility in the survey area was strongly conditioned by erosional factors in the shifting dune topography, and it is likely that additional small sites may be com- pletely obscured at present. Survey of the Jones Ranch Road right-of-way and excavation of three sites was completed by the Zuni Archaeology Program (ZAP) under the direction of T. J. Ferguson. These sites are located in the upland area (ca. 2,133 m) between the Whitewater and Manuelito drainages. All three excavated sites con- sisted of from one to three deep pit structures or kivas, three to four room surface structures, and ex- tramural storage pits. The sites express much formal architectural variability, and there is evidence at all sites for long-term use and/or re-occupation of site features. Ceramic, tree-ring, and archaeomagnetic studies are being conducted to determine whether this variability is due to chronological differences. In addition, paleobotanical and faunal analyses have been incorporated into the research design to ex- plore subsistence patterns and the possibility for functional variability at the sites. The results of this project are expected to contribute new chronological and ceramic sequence data for this little known area. Three additional sites on the Jones Ranch Road have been tested, under the supervision of Anders Roman- cito (ZAP) and are expected to provide complemen- 940 [Vol. 46, No. 4,1981]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH tary data on chronology, ceramic seriation, subsis- tence patterns, and functional variability. A final report on the historic Zuni farming villages of Ojo Caliente, Tekapo, Pescado, and Upper and Lower Nutria was completed during 1981 under the general direction of T. J. Ferguson (ZAP). Ethnohis- toric data collection and analysis was conducted by Barbara Holmes (N. P. S.) and architectural record- ing and analysis by Barbara Mills (ZAP). The results of this project include a social history of the farming villages based on oral and written sources and de- tailed architectural descriptions, including dendro- chronological studies, at three of the villages. These "farming" villages were found to have been used for a wide range of activities, including pastoralism, with a peak in construction during the 1880s. The villages are a replacement of an earlier set of satellite sites, occupied in the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries and located closer to the central site of Zuni Pueblo. The basis for this settlement shift are discussed, and the architectural correlates of the cen- tral/satellite settlement pattern are explored. In ad- dition, the fit between results from ethnohistoric and archaeological methodologies is demonstrated in the identification and discussion of culture change over 200 years. A report of the results of archaeological monitor- ing of over 3 km of backhoe trenches within the Na- tional Historic Landmark of Zuni Pueblo, including the late prehistoric of Halona:wa, is being prepared by Barbara Mills (ZAP). It describes nearly 100 ar- chitectural and nonarchitectural features; the analysis of artifactual materials, including attribute analyses of ceramics and ground stone; and site stratification. Interpretation focuses on the growth of Zuni Pueblo over approximately 600 years of occupa- tion. Changes in site plan, construction materials, and construction techniques are discussed. Site for- mation processes responsible for the reduction of the multistoried pueblo to its present configuration are identified and discussed, based on historic maps, stratigraphic data, and observations of ongoing site formation activities made during monitoring activity. Each August, classes registered through Ghost Ranch, Abiquiu, New Mexico, directed by Florence H. Ellis, have been pursuing a study of eleventh- through late twelfth-century change in Gallina house types. These changes appear to be related to deteriorating agricultural potential and wild food availability. In the 1200s the basic individual family house changed in floor plan and size as storage facilities and actual storerooms were added inside the house walls and/or attached to them. To supple- ment food crops, high mountain campsites were util- ized for wild plant and animal resources. Old houses and towers were remodeled as storage places at home. The puzzle of supposed lack of Gallina ritual concern is somewhat alleviated by discovery of an unquestion- able sipapu hidden at the bottom of a firepit, sug- gesting that houses were used for ceremonial ac- tivities. Jonathan E. Reyman and Martin K. Nickels (Illinois State University), funded by Wenner-Gren, com- pleted data collection for re-analyses of burials and artifacts excavated by Pepper in 1896 from Rooms 32-33 at Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon. Collections at the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian were studied, and materials were col- lected to test the hypothesis that these 15 "high status" burials were the remains of Mexican troca- dores. The analyses will be completed by September 1981 as the first part of a planned study of the larger problem of the Chaco burials. The Cibola National Forest reports a survey of ap- proximately seven sections of land in the Manzano Mountains southeast of Tijeras Canyon. Emily Garber (UNM) directed the first phase of the survey, with the second phase directed by Forest Archaeol- ogist Joseph Tainter. The project continues the inves- tigation of high altitude land use patterns in the Sandia-Manzano area. Archaeological remains span- ning the entire sequence from Clovis to Historic were found. Ongoing lithic analysis is aimed at determin- ing site function in the context of regional settlement patterns. William E. Reynolds (ESCA-Tech Corp.) conducted a Class III inventory survey of 11,401 ha for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Blocks VI and VII of the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project (NIIP) in the San Juan Basin. A total of 178 sites/components were recorded, including 66 Archaic, 25 possible Archaic, three Basketmaker, 5 ceramic, 45 Navajo, and 33 Anglo sites. The research consists of: (1) detailed analysis of the environment that describes dune/in- terdune areas, assesses the impact of grazing, and generates an environmental reconstruction; (2) remote sensing and analysis of Anasazi roadways and environmental stratification for the NIIP and surrounding areas; (3) multivariate analysis of the lithic Archaic sites to address functional, temporal, and spatial relationships; (4) investigation of the historic Navajo and Anglo sites focusing on their functional, temporal placement, and material cultural differentiation; and (5) analysis and inter- pretation of small lithic sites. Another survey for the BIA is underway by ESCA- Tech Corporation (William Reynolds and Meade Kemrer) in the Summit/Twin Buttes and Defiance Plateau areas. Extensive Navajo historic and eth- nohistoric research emphasizes regional subsistence patterns, economic and culture history, and the iden- tification of areas of procurement and sacred use. Thus far, 1,578 ha have been surveyed and 48 sites, 45 of which are Navajo and 3 prehistoric, have been located. The balance of the survey will be completed during spring 1981. During 1980 and the first part of 1981, the School of American Research (SAR), under the direction of John D. Beal, completed 52 archaeological projects. The majority of these projects were small surveys located either in the Santa Fe/Abiquiu area or in the southern San Juan Basin. Santa Fe/Abiquiu area surveys were structured as inventory surveys and aided in supplementing the understanding of local prehistory and history. San Juan Basin surveys were subsumed under a general area research design fo- cused on land use patterns through time and between 941</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY areas, Archaic adaptive strategies, and Navajo culture change. Kit McCrary and Cherie Scheick (SAR) undertook additional work at the Abiquiu Reservoir for the Corps of Engineers. Sites from previous surveys were relocated and assessed for inundation impact. The majority of sites subject to direct impact were de- stroyed with very little evidence of their earlier com- position and/or location. Subsurface testing revealed little evidence for buried artifacts. John Beal and Cherie Scheick (SAR) conducted survey work on 17 sections of land adjacent to the Deliz escarpment, after completing an initial recon- naissance survey there on roughly four sections of land. In all, 135 sites and 520 isolated occurrences were recorded for discrete periods of time. Emphasis was placed on determining land use through time, the nature of the Navajo/Historic use, Archaic adaptive strategies, and the evaluation of our current knowledge regarding Archaic behavior in the San Juan Basin, Land use through time is suggested to have been discontinuous and specialized. Very few remains suggest habitation-related behavior for the area. A few large Archaic sites are thought to be products of repeated use rather than long-term occu- pation. Navajo occupation indicates a higher fre- quency of area residence than earlier periods. Pueblo sites on the whole are ephemeral with only two pueblos recorded. All sites exhibit a preference for dune/slope locations. Cherie Scheick and John Beal (SAR) conducted work on approximately 11 sections of land adjacent to the San Mateo/Mesa Chivato project and recorded 139 sites and 323 isolated occurrences. Special em- phasis was placed on developing methods for record- ing dispersed, ephemeral lithic sites and on the methods of assigning chronological and cultural con- trols. Sites reflect a highly mobile adaptive strategy through time which focused on the collection of wild plants and a generalized tool kit. The extent and in- tensity of that usage varied through time and across space, possibly fluctuating in response to surround- ing environmental conditions. Richard C. Chapman (SAR) carried out additional survey work in the Star Lake area, finding 36 sites and 301 isolated occurrences which corroborate earlier research results. Special attention was paid to lithic attributes and their recording. Work on a matching funds grant with the State Historic Preservation Office on historic coal mining towns in New Mexico was initiated by Cherie Scheick and John Beal (SAR). Special attention is placed on developing an historical overview of coal mining in New Mexico, on architectural documen- tation of coal towns, on an evaluation of the towns' research potential, and on establishing the economic and social consequences of coal mining in New Mex- ico's development. The document will serve as a management aid for dealing with the increased min- ing interest in the state. John Beal and Cherie Scheick (SAR) continued work for Plains Electric in the Prewitt area with the excavation of more than 20 Pueblo and Navajo sites. Preliminary findings aid in defining a support popu- lation for Casamero Ruin and the nature of the in- teraction. Richard Lang (SAR) has reviewed and modified prior typologies for the P I-III ceramics of the Prewitt locality, employing over 9,000 sherds col- lected through the testing program. Using seriational techniques, the pottery of 14 sites was organized chronologically, shedding important light on type fre- quency change in the eastern Red Mesa Valley ceramic complex during the Red Mesa and Wingate phases. Excavations at three Archaic and prehistoric Pueblo sites in the lower Ojo Caliente Valley were conducted by Richad Lang (SAR). Among the Archaic features uncovered was a small, shallow pithouse with an associated radiocarbon date of 5240 ? 130 radiocarbon years. Both the date and artifacts place this structure in the late Bajada Phase. Other features and associated artifacts of the following San Jose and Armijo phases reflect extremely short- term and recurrent visitations by small social units engaged in fairly repetitive task behavior which ap- pears to have focused on seed collection and process- ing. Analysis of lithic raw materials disclosed major changes in the selection of raw material types during the Bajada, San Jose, and Armijo phases of the Ar- chaic. The Pueblo period aspect of the project dealt with a cobble-bordered, gravel-mulched, agricultural site. Studies focused on questions regarding moisture retention properties, solar exposure, erosion control, and associated cultigen type(s). Pollen analysis dis- closed an abundance of chenoam pollen, but no clear evidence for type or types of plants cultivated. Sandra Rayl and Meade Martin (SAR) tested a small field house site endangered by mining-related work in San Lucas Canyon. Analysis indicated small- scale, low-intensity horticulture along secondary drainages in marginal areas during P II. Testing procedures were carried out under the direction of Richard Chapman (SAR) to examine the nature and depth of Archaic sites in dune situations. The majority of sites in the area were found to be very shallow. Results were used to structure a miti- gation program for work associated with mining operations. The Archaeology Laboratory (University of Texas- El Paso) is in the third and final year of an intensive survey of 991 km2 on Fort Bliss's Dona Ana Range and Maneuver Area 8 in south-central New Mexico; Rex E. Gerald (UTEP) is Principal Investigator and David Carmichael (UTEP) is Project Archaeologist. Over 6,200 sites have been catalogued ranging in time from paleo-Indian to twentieth-century ranches. Early sites (before A.D. 1100) appear to be widely distributed over the bolson, while most later aborig- inal sites (A.D. 1100-1400) are restricted to alluvial slopes or to certain areas within the bolson. Sylvia V. Gaines GREATER MESOAMERICA Preceramic discoveries stand out in recent Meso- american research. In Mexico a variety of early discoveries has followed from investigations by the Departamento de Prehistoria, INAH, reported by the 942 !Vol. 46, No. 4, 19811</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH departmental head, Joaquin Garcia-Barcena. In Belize a survey has located preceramic coastal occu- pations. Early dates for human occupation continue to accumulate from the Prehistoria research, and projects in Chiapas and Belize are of special interest because they provide long Archaic sequences. In par- ticular the coastal preceramic sequence is the first obtained in Mesoamerica. These preceramic reports are grouped together and presented first. The El Cedral site, a now-dry spring, is close to Matehuala, San Luis Potosi. Fieldwork by Jose Luis Lorenzo and Lorena Mirambell (Prehistoria, INAH) began in 1977 and continues. The site has abundant Rancholabrean fauna but only sporadic indications of human activity. A hearth was found surrounded by mammoth bones but lacking artifacts, dated 31,850 ? 1600 (1-10483). In other deposits they discovered a few stone tools and a pointed tool of horse bone dated to 21,960 ? 540 (I-10436). At another site in San Luis Potosi, Salinas, near Laguna de las Cruces, Mirambell excavated Pleisto- cene fauna and sporadic evidence of human occupa- tion consisting of a few flakes. There were no radio- metric dates. Northwest of Mexico City near the shore of Lake Zumpango a site was discovered on the Santa Lucia air base. Mammoth and camelid remains were in- vestigated by J. Mora Echeverria and 0. Rodriguez Lazcano (Prehistoria, INAH). Both the positioning of mammoth bones and evidence of incisions on them in- dicated human use, along with the presence of three flakes of andesite and obsidian. Two radiocarbon dates from the faunal stratum were 23,900 ? 660 (1-10427) and 26,300 ? 880 (EX-6628). From an underlying stratum they obtained a date of 28,345 + 1200 (EX-6627). Subsequently, another mammoth find was excavated by M. R. Avilez, F. Fuentes Galin- do and C. Chac6n (Prehistoria, INAH). They are now trying to determine what stratigraphic relation this may have to a nearby concentration of burnt bone of mammoth and smaller animals which had an asso- ciated andesite flake. In the Ocozocoautla Valley in Chiapas, between 1974 and 1977 J. Garcia-Barcena and D. Santamaria (Prehistoria, INAH) excavated two rockshelters, San- ta Marta and Los Grifos. Ancillary geological and biological studies in the region were part of the proj- ect. The excavators sought material antecedent to that encountered by R. S. MacNeish and F. A. Peter- son in earlier work at Santa Marta. The earliest oc- cupation identified was radiocarbon dated to 9280 ? 290 (I-9259) and 9330 + 290 (I-9260); it reflects rainy season occupation by small groups with a mixed hunting (deer, rabbit, armadillo) and collecting sub- sistence. A few large Gramineae pollen grains may be either maize or teosinte; the latter grows in the area today. Grinding slabs occur in the lithic inven- tory along with a variety of chipped stone tools. Sub- sequently, between 9200-7200 B.P., brief dry season use is indicated, with the third phase, 7200-6600 B.P., reflecting a return to the first phase subsistence practices. Root remains from these deposits have not been identified, but definitely are not Manihot or Ipomoea. Between 6600 and 6300 B.P. the occupation alters to one of use by larger groups for longer periods in the rainy season. Subsistence is largely un- changed except for more evidence of hunting. After a hiatus in occupation, the sequence resumes at 3300 B.P. during ceramic periods and continues through post-Conquest times. During ceramic periods the variety of collected plants increases but there is no evidence of cultivated plants save for one maize cob. However, beginning about 4000 B.P. the pollen record shows an increase in secondary vegetation which may reflect increasing agriculture. A strict pattern of seasonal use does not characterize the ceramic occupations. Small amounts of nonlocal pot- tery and obsidian suggest use of the shelter by mer- chants. The smaller Los Grifos rockshelter is nearby. It, too, has ceramic components; these are underlain by an erosional disconformity and then by seven strati- graphic units dated 10,000-8500 B.P. by one obsidian hydration and three radiocarbon dates. The earliest occupations contain no extinct fauna. A fluted pro- jectile point in a deposit dated between 8900 and 9300 B.P. was associated with two "fish-tailed" points related stylistically to those known from South America. Garcia-Barcena regards the fluted point as a regional Clovis variant. The same investigators are engaged in a broader survey of three Chiapan highland areas for pre- ceramic sites. In the Aguacatenango Valley nine sites were located on geologic terraces, some of which date to Pleistocene times; the sites contain only lithics and have not been dated, although some of the scrapers appear to be of preceramic form. A similar situation was discovered in the Teopisca Valley where nine lithic sites were located. In the San Cristobal de las Casas Valley the Corral de Piedra rockshelter was excavated but produced only ceramic period deposits. Currently, Santamaria is excavating a site on terraces of the Fogotica River, where preceramic levels were encountered; to date, the deepest radiocarbon dated deposits were 7790 ? 130 (I-11513). Much of the early lithic material is debitage. J. A. P6rez Gollan (Prehistoria, INAH) conducted a geological and archaeological reconnaissance of the Cuenca Oriental, the area defined by the Cofre de Perote, Pico de Orizaba, and La Malinche. Several rockshelters were located, but tests in three of them produced no preceramic occupations. The climatic and palynological studies that form part of the proj- ect are expected to help in anticipated environmental reconstruction in that area and, with modifications, in other parts of Central Mexico. Richard S. MacNeish and Jeffrey Wilkerson (Peabody Foundation) surveyed along the Belizean coast and located 230 preceramic sites. A. Nelken- Terner (CRNS) was in charge of laboratory work. Ninety-two sites were surface collected and test ex- cavations were placed in a few. By cross-dating lithic tools they constructed a sequence spanning 9000-2000 B.C. Tools and site locations formed the basis of a trial settlement-subsistence reconstruc- tion. The Lowe-ha complex (ca. 9000-7500 B.C.) camps were located on sand ridges where savannas 943</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY would have supported large game animals. Scrapers and blades appear related to those from Loltun Cave associated with horse and other extinct fauna. In the Sand Hill complex (ca. 7500-5500 B.C.) tropical forest and near-shore sites suggest more use of diverse habitats. In the Stone Bowl complex (ca. 5500-4200 B.C.) seasonal movements are thought to have occurred between inland areas in the wet season and river, estuarine, and coastal locations in the dry season. During the Melinda Complex (ca. 4200-3300 B.C.) a coastal aquatic subsistence focus was adopted. Present were large sites with extensive middens suggesting permanent villages or at least semisedentary base camps. The Progreso complex (ca. 3300-2500 B.C.) bears witness to a shift from the near-shore zone to riverine floodplains, presumably reflecting the habitat preference of early farmers. The coastal sequence could reflect sedentarization prior to cultivation, in contrast to the pattern docu- mented in highland valleys like Tehuacan. AGENCIES. GENERAL. During 1980 Angel Garcia Cook left Salvamento Arqueolo6gico to become the new head of the Departamento de Monumentos Prehispanicos, INAH. He continues as President of the Consejo de Arqueologia. In Tlaxcala an INAH Delegaci6n was created under Yolanda Ramos Galicia. The new head of the Campeche Delegaci6n is Luis Millet Camara. For the Delegaci6n of the Edo. de Mexico, Roberto Gallegos Ruiz is the new head. The new Director of the Museo Nacional de Antropologia is Mario Vazquez. The new Director of the C. R. de Oaxaca is Rogelio Gonzalez. During 1980 there were several staff changes at Dumbarton Oaks with the resignation of Elizabeth P. Benson as Curator and of Anne-Louise Schaffer as Assistant Curator. Replacing them, respectively, are Elizabeth H. Boone, Associate Curator, and Carlos Arostegui, Assistant Curator. In the fall the museum sponsored a conference titled "Interdisciplinary Ap- proaches to the Study of Mesoamerican Highland- Lowland Interaction." This was organized and chaired by Arthur Miller (University Museum, University of Pennsylvania.) Ninety participants met to integrate the various approaches taken in the study of the interaction among different Mesoameri- can groups; the Classic Maya-Teotihuacan relation was explored in particular. Late in 1980 Dumbarton Oaks facilitated a workshop chaired by Frederick Lange (Illinois State University) on Pre-Columbian jade, with a focus on technology. Early in 1981 the Hidalgo regional center, INAH, held a conference titled "Obsidian in Mesoamerica." Symposium themes were diverse, ranging from sourc- ing studies to technology, classification, production loci, and exchange. At present, two methodological studies are under- way by personnel of Prehistoria, INAH. Various statis- tical classification procedures for obsidian artifacts are being compared by 0. Rodriguez Lazcano. The obsidian collection is from a rockshelter near Abasolo, Guanajuato. M. R. Avilez is applying various classifications to experimentally produced sherds from modern pottery manufactured by tradi- tional methods. Alternate quantitative procedures are being compared in regard to the information they supply about the original ceramic situation. ESTADO DE MEXICO. HIDALGO. SAN LUIS POTOSI. The Cerro de la Campana Project, Ahuacatitlan, Estado de Mexico, reported last year, continues with archaeoastronomical studies. Recent investigations indicate not only the presence of trade routes from Teotihuacan through Cerro de la Cam- pana, Chalchihuites, and Casas Grandes into the U.S. Southwest, but also the diffusion of astronomical knowledge between these centers manifested by the distribution of pecked cross motifs. During a visit by Anthony Aveni and Horst Hartung, who have studied such petroglyphs elsewhere, drawings were made of pecked crosses. Roman Pifia Chan (C. R. Estado de Mexico), William J. Folan (Texas, San Antonio), and Antonio Ruiz Perez (Casa de la Cultura, Acambay), co-directors of the project, hope to establish the local use and meaning of the symbols and their relation to archaeoastronomy in Mesoamerica. Dan M. Healan (Tulane) is conducting a 1-year pro- gram of archaeological research at the Early Post- classic site of Tula, Hidalgo with support from NSF. The project is based on previous research which re- vealed a concentration of obsidian surface debris over a large portion of the eastern half of the site, which may have contained obsidian workshops. The current project involves excavation to expose one probable workshop. A combination of extensive, con- tinuous excavation and systematic test-pitting was applied to an area roughly 20 by 30 m within which three general areas were identified: an area of superimposed domestic structures built over refuse; an area downslope which served as a dumping area for debitage and production rejects as well as house- hold refuse; and an open area between these two which may have been the actual workshop site. A preliminary ceramic appraisal indicates occupation throughout the Tollan phase and Tula's apogee (ca. A.D. 950-1150) Lithics, of which there may be as much as one metric ton, suggest core-blade produc- tion. Healan plans a detailed study of raw material input, manufacturing technology, and product out- put. Guy Stresser-Pean is completing the ceramic analysis for a final report on work at the site of Tam- tok near Tamuin in San Luis Potosi. Tamtok is a Late Postclassic Huastec center. Investigation has been concentrated on the ceremonial plaza, and a descrip- tive report is being readied. GUERRERO. CHIHUAHUA. COAHUILA. DURANGO. BAJA CALIFORNIA. In Guerrero, Proyecto Mezcala is underway, directed by Louis Paradis (Montreal). Survey located 73 sites in selected parts of the Tepecoacuilco drainage; sites range from surface artifactual scatters to public centers. Settlement pattern analysis will compare site locations to ecological and socioeconomic variables. Test pits were placed in four sites to gain information on the cultural sequence in the region. A shell mound near the coastal lagoon of Tetitlan was excavated in 1974 by J. Mora Echeverria (Pre- historia, INAH). Geological, pedological, botanical, 944 [Vol. 46, No. 4, 1981]</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH and palynological analyses form part of the ongoing related studies to determine changes in resource use in comparison to changes in resources. Radiocarbon dates indicate site occupation between 2570 and 3170 B.P. L. Gonzalez Arratia (Prehistoria, INAH) and G. Halffter (Instituto de Ecologia) have begun a survey of the Bols6n de Mapimi at the juncture of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango. The area was stratified botanically and geologically prior to the selection of survey transects. The research is de- signed to compare the distribution of hunter-gatherer sites with resource areas. Near Madera, Chihuahua, A. Guevara (Prehis- toria, INAH) is excavating and restoring a cliff-dwell- ing called Las Cuarenta Casas, which seems to be related to Casas Grandes. Wooden beams may allow dendrochronological dating. J. Mora Echeverria (Prehistoria, INAH) began a long-term research project in 1979 to study parts of the Baja California peninsula. The purpose is to com- pare coastal and inland sites in regard to social organization. Survey has begun in the Cabo region in southern Baja. OAXACA. GULF COAST LOWLANDS. Exca- vations continued at San Jose Mogote by Kent Flan- nery and Joyce Marcus (Michigan). A series of Ter- minal Formative temples were uncovered, but only the most complex example is described here. Burnt areas on the plaster floor of a Monte Alban II temple (Str. 35) presumably showed where incense burners were usually placed. In the inner temple room were obsidian blades and parts of sacrificial knives. Beneath temple room floors were four "offering boxes." Two were emptied in antiquity. Of the two in- tact boxes one contained two jade figures; the other contained seven ceramic pieces arranged in a ritual scene: a miniature tomb was constructed of small adobes and fitted with a limestone slab roof. Inside the tomb was a bowl, a small urn, and a small bird skeleton. Above the roof was a "flying figure" with a flowing cape. Bird bones and deer antlers were near- by. Behind the miniature tomb were four anthro- pomorphic urns facing the "flying figure." Flannery and Marcus speculate that the ritual scene repre- sents the apotheosis and ritual surrounding the burial of a royal ancestor. The C. R. de Oaxaca completed the final season of in- vestigations at and near San Juan Yucuita, Nochixtlan (reported previously) under the direction of Mar- cus Winter. Both household and civic-ceremonial locations continued to be investigated. Among the numerous salvage excavations administered by the C. R., the discovery of pottery kilns at San Agustin de las Juntas by Herbert Montafio N. (Salvamento, INAH) is noteworthy. The kilns date to Monte Alban I and IIIB and were used for production of gray wares. These data will contribute to the information on ceramic production in Oaxaca, currently the most complete for any area of Mesoamerica due to the survey projects there (see below). During 7 months of survey in 1980 the Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project completed coverage of the valley. Stephen Kowalewski (Georgia) directed the project, funded by NSF. Other full-time participants were Gary Feinman, Linda Nicholas, Barbara Macnider (ASU), Laura Finsten (Purdue), J. Michael Elam (Georgia), Charles McNett, Jr., (American University), and Benjamin Fischler (Michigan). The 800 km2 eastern (Tlacolula) arm as well as smaller areas in the northern and southern arms were surveyed. The total survey from all seasons covers more than 2,000 km2. Since 1971 ap- proximately 9,000 Pre-Hispanic occupations have been mapped and recorded. During 1980 a Clovis-style projectile point was found near the town of San Guelavia. Archaic oc- cupations also were found in the Tlacolula and Etla arms. Two well-known sites (Mitla and Yagul) in the Tlacolula arm were mapped in their entirety for the first time. During the analysis period the investiga- tors will focus on (1) regional scale social changes from simple origins through a long period of complex states, and (2) use of the data to examine several theoretical topics such as the role of population shifts in social change, the probable effects of administra- tive meddling in production and exchange, and the causes of the Classic-Postclassic transition in high- land Mesoamerica. The Huaxtec Archaeological Project was reported in 1979. Since that time the number of sites located in survey has increased dramatically to 523 and reports on the survey and test excavations are nearing com- pletion. The project is directed by A. Garcia Cook assisted by B. Leonor Merino C. (Monumentos Pre- hispanicos, INAH). The project is concerned with the lower basin of the Panuco River in San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas. Discovery of a Postclas- sic cemetery near one site provided unusually ample physical anthropological information. Also of note is a series of preceramic or aceramic sites located in the Mante area of Tamaulipas. The Gasoducto Proj- ect, also under Garcia's direction and reported previously is close to final publication. CHIAPAS. YUCATAN. The second field season of Proyecto Soconusco, a study of economic prehis- tory of a portion of the Chiapas coast, will be under- way in early 1981, supported by NSF. Barbara Voorhies (UCSB) is the project director. Two sites, believed to have been pivotal in the prehistoric economic development of the region, are scheduled for excavation. One of these, Rio Arriba, may have developed as a transshipment center for goods being moved between land and water transport. One of the major commodities appears to have been plumbate pottery. Clarifying the economic role of this site will be one concern of Linda Pfeiffer (UCSB), who will direct excavations at that site with doctoral funding from NSF. The second site, Acapetahua, may have developed as a pottery production center and as a central place regionally; it could have been one of the towns that paid tribute to Tenochtitlan in late pre- historic times. During 1980 the Middle American Research Insti- tute (Tulane) continued the Komchen project, reported last year. The staff of the project, which 945</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY was funded by NSF, MARI, and the C. R. del Sureste of INAH, included E. Wyllys Andrews, V, (MARI), and Norberto Gonzalez C. (C. R. del Sureste) as direc- tors, W. M. Ringle and P. J. Barnes (Tulane), S. D. Gillespie (Illinois), K. Rowland (New Mexico), and A. Barrera R. and T. Gallareta (U. Yucatan). Special studies by a variety of scholars are underway con- cerning settlement patterns, ceramics, vertebrate fauna, lithics, molluscs, pollen, and obsidian. During the last season the staff mapped about 1 km2 of Komchen, approximately half of the site, and placed test excavations in about 160 platforms, or close to 45% of the structures in the main transect surveyed. The site at its Late Preclassic peak con- tained 900 to 1,000 structures compactly arranged. The center of the site was formed by about six very large platforms containing roughly 50,000 m3 of stone and earth fill around a rectangular plaza. All of the large platforms were extensively looted for build- ing materials during the early 1950s. One of them, Str. 500, was consolidated by the project. Archi- tectural remains include the very big central struc- tures, hundreds of sizable flat-topped residential platforms that often cover hundreds of square meters, and many small platforms large enough to support only one or two perishable superstructures. The latter are found over most of the site but are more frequent near the periphery, producing an im- pression of concentric zoning. Preliminary analysis of key ceramic lots indicates that most of the largest structures and a 260 m long causeway date to about 350-300 B.C. Large public architecture, however, appeared earlier, probably before 500 B.C. At least some construction continued through the terminal Preclassic period, and there is no evidence of a serious population decline before the end of the Preclassic. The site was essentially abandoned in the Early Classic, but saw a large influx of people in the Late and Terminal Classic. The late inhabitants seem to have built few platforms. The early date of large civic or religious construc- tion at Komchen contrasts with many lowland Maya sites to the south, where massive Preclassic buildings tend to be later. The reasons for the early growth of Komchen are not understood, but one idea is that the wealth and presumed importance of the community may have derived in part from exploitation of salt flats, an easy day's walk to the north. BELIZE. The second season of research at Colha in northern Belize was completed in 1980. Partici- pants in the collaborative project are Thomas R. Hester (Texas, San Antonio) as administer, Harry J. Shafer (Texas A &amp; M), and Giancarlo Ligabue (Cen- tro Studi e Ricerche in Venice); R. E. W. Adams and Jack D. Eaton (Texas, San Antonio) are the project co- directors. They have documented at least 86 work- shops, roughly 9% of the total number of mounds and structures at the site. Many workshops are mounded accumulations of chert debitage, up to 1.75 m thick. Horizontally, the major workshops reach 20 m in maximum diameter. The deposits consist of a debitage matrix containing tools broken or rejected in manufacture, hammerstones, and scattered ceramics, which have served to date the workshops. Distinctive assemblages characterize lithic produc- tion in various periods. In the Late Preclassic (Chicanel) the production of large oval bifaces and tranchet bit adzes was emphasized; stemmed macro- blade points ("daggers") and eccentrics also were made. Some workshops may have produced a mini- mum of 35,000 tranchet bit adzes. The bifaces were blanks which could be transformed into celts, axes, or hoes. To date 31 Late Preclassic workshops are known at Colha and 3 have been excavated. There is little evidence for Early Classic occupa- tions, but for the Late Classic (Tepeu) there are 15 workshops. That assemblage is dominated by a chert core-blade technology utilizing polyhedral conical and tabular unifacial blade cores. The blades were chipped into unifacial points. Bifaces designed primarily for use as celts were being made, as were the thick biconvex bifaces known in the lowlands as "general utility" tools. A Late Classic obsidian work- shop is known at Colha, one characterized by tiny blades and flakes. Apparently, small cores and other pieces of obsidian were reduced in a nonsystematic fashion. Obsidian occurs in small quantities in most deposits at Colha, and x-ray fluorescence indicates that it is almost all from Ixtepeque in Guatemala. The Early Postclassic (New Town) workshops number 12, often associated with middens. At first, side-notched points and triangular preforms are characteristic, followed by lenticular and lozenge- shaped bifaces and triangular adze-like tools. No Late Postclassic occupation has been identified. Detailed analyses are being done of the lithics from Colha to explore production systems, craft speciali- zation, and distribution networks. Materials ob- served elsewhere by staff members from Cuello, Pull- trouser Swamp, and Cerros have led to speculation that the bulk of the Colha lithic exports went north to sites outside the region of chert outcrops. Lithic production is not the only investigation underway at Colha. Midden deposits, a plazuela group, and public architecture have been excavated as well. One unusual discovery was a "skull pit" on a terrace of an elite structure in the main plaza. It con- tained 28 adult and juvenile crania associated with large sherds of terminal Classic date. At another locality a stratified deposit yielded Swasey ceramics in a cooking pit located below Middle Preclassic deposits. A regional survey is underway, directed by Tom Kelly (Texas, San Antonio). The Trent-Cayo Terrace Project continued investi- gation of ancient Maya agricultural terraces on the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, Cayo District, Belize, to identify, map, and date them as well as determine their function and history. The last field season was directed by P. F. Healy (Trent) and funded by the Social Science and Humanities Re- search Council of Canada. During 1980 teams exam- ined a wider area of southern Cayo, focusing on ter- races around the ceremonial center of Caracol and the medium-sized site of Pacbitun, located further north near San Antonio-Cayo. Both sites date mainly to the Classic period and have extensive evidence of hillslope terracing surrounding them. Terrace map- 946 [Vol. 46, No. 4, 1981]</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT RESEARCH ping was overseen by Joel Boriek (Williamsburg Ar- chaeological Foundation) and Gary Coupland (Uni- versity of British Columbia). They also surveyed briefly in the region of Blue Hole Camp, where more terraces were identified and an ancient Maya dam was discovered and excavated. The stone dam crosses a stream tributary of the Raspaculo River. It is the second such feature recorded from the Maya region. Apparently, it originally measured about 10 m wide and 3 m or more high. Other project field- work included housemound excavations, collection of soil samples from terraces, and coring of a reservoir at Caracol, which produced maize pollen. The 1980 season at Lamanai under David Pender- gast (Royal Ontario Museum) involved a variety of ef- forts. Among the many excavations, continued in- vestigation of Preclassic civic-ceremonial construc- tion revealed a platform with masks resembling those at Cerros, further evidence of a widespread lowland architectural practice in the Late Preclassic. At a ballcourt the staff excavated below the large center marker disk and discovered an offering containing mercury, the first reported use of the substance in the lowlands. The ballcourt, dating to the late ninth or early tenth century A.D. is part of the evidence at Lamanai for major construction during the transition to the Postclassic period. Three aspects of the third season excavations at Cuello under Norman Hammond (Rutgers) warrant special note. A Late Preclassic chultun was exposed which had undergone initial construction for food storage, conversion to water storage with a plaster catchment, and final use as a trash dump. Among the trash fill were unfired but levigated clay, lumps of fired clay, and a shallow dishlike mold used for shap- ing part of a large vessel. There were numerous animal and plant remains, including a complete cacao bean, the first recovered archaeologically. After the chultun was cleared out, storage experi- ments were initiated, one involving smoked maize. After 1 month squash, ramon (with pericarp), and loose maize grains had deteriorated. Some plants, in- cluding maize stored in a vessel, were still intact. The chultun was then sealed pending future checks on the stored foods. In other excavations in the south part of the site a plain stela was discovered set upright into a pit in a floor. Erection of the stela is thought to date between 0 and AD 200. As there was no trace of painted or plastered decoration, the excavators assume it was meant to be plain, possibly indicating that the sub- sequent incorporation of iconographic and hiero- glyphic carving on Maya stelae was added to an ex- tant monumental form. The alternative is that the plain stela is a derivation from inscribed stelae dating earlier than those now known in the Maya lowlands. A yrogram of stratified random test pitting in a 1-km area was initiated under the direction of Richard Wilk (Arizona). Of key concern was whether early settlement was limited to visible mounds (which have later occupation) or also included intervening areas. Wilk devised a model to estimate population based on the assumption that there would be a "toss zone" of particular dimensions in which refuse would accumulate around each house. The model is founded on observations of modern Kekchi settle- ment in southern Belize. Refuse and distribution and hence the projected population was greatest in the Late Preclassic and Early Classic. Early and Middle Preclassic occupation was low. Swasey phase material occurred mainly at locations where subse- quent mound construction occurred rather than in nonmound areas. Wilk's model predicts a Swasey phase population of slightly more than 50 households. At Negroman on the Macal River in the Cayo District a Hamilton College project is underway to determine if that site was the historic Maya-Spanish town of Tipu. Grant Jones and Robert Kautz are in- vestigating a suggestion by J. E. S. Thompson that Tipu was in the Negroman region. They have located a probable Spanish church, which tends to support the hypothesis. If the identification is further sup- ported, they will be interested in determining the im- pact of Spanish contact, the origins and affiliations of the population, the political role of Tipu in Spanish-Itza antagonism, and the internal organiza- tion of the site. During 1980 a contour map and ex- cavation sampling were completed. Further excava- tions and a valley survey are planned for 1981. During 1979, research at Cerros, directed by David Freidel (SMU), concentrated on the western margin of the nucleated village that underlies the Late Preclassic public central precinct. In the west- ern margin, which is close to the later public archi- tecture, a possible dock had been identified earlier. Excavations in 1979 located a nearby public sub- structure which is oriented similarly to later public construction. Therefore, they suspect that there was a public center associated with the village. An elaborate termination deposit of smashed vessels, bonfires, and incensarios was found on the buried building, and a radiocarbon date of 94 ? 50 B.C. was associated with its stair. Another aspect of the fieldwork concerned the later, dispersed settlement zone surrounding Cerros. A system of raised fields was discovered in associa- tion with the main perimeter canal surrounding the site. This canal is ca. 1,200 m long, 6 m wide, and 2 m deep; it circumscribes an area of 37 ha. The fields discovered are within the canal perimeter and con- nected to it by feeders. The fields are roughly square, 30 m on a side and oriented to the cardinal direc- tions. Test excavations have shown that the ditches defining the fields are lined with rubble and that the feeder canals and main canal were excavated through bedrock. Ceramics in the fields and canals indicate that the system dates to the Late Preclassic period. The full extent of the field system is still unknown. GUATEMALA. EL SALVADOR. At El Mirador both mapping and excavation were accomplished during 1980. The directors of the project are Ray T. Matheny (Brigham Young) and Bruce H. Dahlin (Catholic). Mapping at El Mirador, located about 70 km north of Uaxactun, was done by L. S. B., Inc. using infrared-powered transits that have provided the ac- 947</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY curacy necessary for analysis of celestial alignment of building complexes. A permanent grid was estab- lished for future sampling and mapping. Mapping of the Tigre Complex confirmed the enormous size of the central pyramid, a structure 51 m high, which is larger in volume than Temple IV at Tikal. The Danta Complex, located 2 km east of the Tigre Complex, was mapped in a preliminary way, showing that the main building with its platforms is over 60 m high and the basal platform is over 300 m long. Excavations in Building 34 in the Tigre Complex exposed an anthropomorphic stucco mask flanking a stuccoed staircase. Excavations in the rooms atop the building and in other areas produced approxi- mately 12,000 Chicanel sherds, dating the construc- tion to the terminal Late Preclassic. Another area tested which proved to be Preclassic was the junc- ture of three causeways at the western edge of the site. Although there is a Late Classic component at the Danta Complex consisting of elite residences, no public architecture of that date has been identified yet. The Maya lowlands radar survey is a joint proj- ect of NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Chur- chill College at Cambridge University, the Lende Foun- dation, and the University of Texas at San Antonio. Walter E. Brown, Jr. (JPL), T. Patrick Culbert (Arizona), and R. E. W. Adams (Texas, San Antonio) are the researchers. The aim of the project, which began in 1977, is to test and apply airborne synthetic aperture radar to tropical forest zones in the hope that archaeological features will be recorded. Flights over Guatemala and Belize were carried out in three different years with improving results, and Adams analyzed the 1978 data aided by scholars at Cam- bridge University. Most of the information on the im- agery is nonarchaeological-modern roads, water courses, air strips, geological structures, etc. However, sets of lattice patterned lines also ap- pear and correlate with known swamp zones, which suggests that they might be canal systems. Pattern analogy with known canal systems and air photos which show grids in the same areas tend to support the interpretation. Culbert and Adams, assisted by H. W. Lende and T. Greaves, as well as colleagues working in Belize, carried out preliminary ground checks of some of the patterned areas during 1980 and confirmed that ancient canals did exist in some localities in the Pet6n and northern Belize. Five zones were confirmed in Belize and one in the Pasion area, and a raised field was found in the Tikal zone. Ground checks in the Pet6n were much less satis- factory than in northern Belize. However, Adams believes that the air photos combined with radar data do show extensive raised fields and canals in the Pet6n. The total estimated extent of presently detected fields is between 1,250 and 2,500 km2. This does not include the known and confirmed raised fields detected in Quintana Roo, nor canals along the Candelaria River in western Campeche, which would add about 500 km2 to the total. A combination of ir- rigation and drainage functions seems to be involved. In Adam's view the new data establish a firmer economic base under Maya civilization, but as yet there is relatively little dating of the systems, and the specifics of hydrology, land management, crop inven- tories, soil correlations, and other matters remain to be investigated. In Proyecto Lacustre, reported last year, a second season of survey and test pitting was completed in 1980. Don Rice (Chicago) and Prudence Rice (U. Florida) finished survey transects at Lakes Macanch6, Salpeten, Quexil, and Petenxil in the Pet6n. In a separate but coordinated effort E. S. Deevey continued ecological analyses, including recoring of the lake sediments. At Lake Salpeten a densely settled peninsular site dating to the Post- classic may have been the ethnohistorically known community of Zacpeten. In the course of mapping and testing the site two stelae were encountered, one plain and one carved, although badly destroyed. The latter is similar in size and shape to two at Ixlu that bear dates near the end of the Postclassic. Since Zacpeten has Late Classic through Late Postclassic pottery, it may have been occupied more or less con- tinuously through the Maya collapse. Test pitting on two structures on islands in Lake Eckixil revealed Postclassic ceramics and architecture-Itza settle- ment on the islands was reported in Spanish docu- ments. The general picture emerging from the project is that the lake zones show Middle Preclassic to Late Postclassic occupation, broken by a conspicuous decline in the Early Classic. At Lake Macanch6 the decline was preceded by a Floral Park Terminal Pre- classic complex associated with a defensive wall sur- rounding an area at the northeast corner of the lake. In the Chixoy River basin the Pueblo Viejo-Quixal project continued in 1980 under the direction of Alain Ichon (Mission Francaise). A report on the Cauinal site already has been published, and recent work has concentrated on El Jocote and Chitomax. Each is a small ceremonial center with habitations nearby. The project, one of the few active in Guate- mala at present, has developed a Preclassic to con- quest period cultural chronology for the area, and found evidence of a Late Classic period phallic cult-previously identified in the literature mainly with the Gulf Coast lowlands. In 1979 and 1980 archaeological investigations were conducted at Guaytan in the San Agustin Acasaguastlan archaeological zone, department of El Progreso, by Garry Rex Walters (Missouri, Columbia). The ceramic types firmly establish an oc- cupational history between 400 B.C. and A.D. 1000. The survey located a number of tombs and jade/ob- sidian workshops. The occupational sequence was reinforced by stratified ceramic samples from ex- cavations. The most successful endeavor of the project related to the workshops. Numerous intact obsidian cores (totaling 5,199), core and blade fragments, and a large amount of both unworked jade and jade ar- tifacts broken in processing were recovered, along with some jade-working implements. The artifact distribution suggests that the obsidian workshops were in direct association with jade workshops and that obsidian blades supplied the cutting implements necessary for manufacture and maintenance of some jade-working tools. 948 [Vol. 46, No. 4, 1981]</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT RESEARCH The Centro de Investigaciones Regionales de Meso- america (CIRMA) in Antigua has begun a long-term research project to reconstruct the changing size and distribution of the Indian and Spanish populations of Guatemala from 1500 to 1821. Archival sources in Spain, Mexico, and Guatemala will be augmented by an archaeological reconnaissance of the highlands and Pacific coast. The first step was begun during 1980 when George Lovell (Queen's University, Canada), Christopher Lutz (CIRMA), and William Swezey (CIRMA) orga- nized bibliographic material. The lacunae identified include the Cakchiquel area, most of the Verapaz highlands, and large parts of southwestern and southeastern Guatemala. Analysis was also begun of the demographic and tribute data of the earliest and spatially most extensive tribute assessment for Guatemala, the "Cerrato" census of 1548-1551 in the Guatemalan Archivo General de las Indias. Much of the effort involved correlation of sixteenth-century place names with specific present-day settlements. The second stage of research will be initiated in 1981. CIRMA, in cooperation with the Consejo Nacional para la Protecci6n de la Antigua Guatemala, also has begun an archaeological project to establish a ceramic chronology for the Valley of Panchoy during the 300 years of the Spanish colony. Excavations were begun in the cathedral under the direction of William Swezey (CIRMA) and with the collaboration of Luis Lujan and students from the national univer- sity. The Panchoy Valley offers great potential for historical archaeology, although the natural stratig- raphy is chaotic due to a constant history of flooding, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and urban recon- struction. Through excavation and ethnohistorical research the investigators expect to reveal the evolu- tion of majolica and indigenous ceramic wares from 1541 to the present. The present level of political violence in the Quich6 area has led to suspension of the Quiche Project directed by Robert Carmack (SUNY, Albany). Cur- rently, Carmack, James Mondloch, and Rene Acufia (UNAM) are preparing a translation and commen- tary on the Titulo Totonicapan. Payson Sheets (Colorado), William Loker, and Stick Ware (Colorado) returned to the Ceren site in 1980 for further geophysical explorations and to confirm the nature of anomalies discovered previously. They completed resistivity traverses within the 100- by 100-m grid set up southwest of the previously exca- vated Ceren farmhouse. They employed a core drill- ing rig and crew loaned by the federal Centro de Estudios Geotecnicas in El Salvador. Three anomalies were drilled, and two turned out to be structures. The third was unresolved. Spacing between those structures identified to date averages about 60 m, allowing each family ap- proximately one-third ha of relatively intensive agri- cultural production surrounding their house. Because they farmed the only slightly weathered II- opango volcanic ash, this land would have been insuf- ficient to feed a family, and they probably had less in- tensive agricultural areas nearby. Excavation of structures has been postponed due to war. Barbara L. Stark 949</page></plain_text>
