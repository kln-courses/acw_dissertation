MONKEY BUSINESS AT NORTHERN RIVER LAGOON A coastal-inland interaction sphere in northern Belize Shirley Boteler Mock Institute of Texan Cultures, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX 78205-3926, USA Abstract Ongoing fieldwork at the coastal site of Northern River Lagoon (NRL) in northern Belize, a specialized saltmaking community, has revealed a consumer relationship with the large, inland, stone-tool-producing center of Colha during the Late to Terminal Classic. Artifact distribution suggests that this economic partnership involved the movement of salt, salted products, and trade goods to Colha in exchange for stone tools. This inland-coastal partnership was enhanced by a shared ideology reflected in the iconography of identical Palmar Orange-polychrome plates. The presence of the ideologically imbued plates in both elite and nonelite contexts suggests they were intended to strengthen group allegiance and reinforce territorial boundaries during this troubled time. This study stimulates new insights into the structure of ancient Maya coastal-inland interaction spheres in northern Belize, thereby facilitating comparisons between local areas within a regional context. Small sites on the coast of Belize are yielding important data re garding environmental, socioeconomic, and political circumstances related to cultural changes during the Late to Terminal Classic (a.d. 670-900) in the southern Maya lowlands. This paper concerns one of these sites—the Northern River Lagoon (NRL)—a small trans shipment port or way station located at the northern end of North ern River Lagoon on the coast of Belize (Figure 1), which has been the subject of more than a decade of investigations by the Colha Project (Hester 1979, 1983, 1985; Hester and Shafer 1984, 1991, 1994; Hester et al. 1980, 1982; Kelly 1980, 1982, 1987; Kelly and Valdez 1979; Mock 1994a; Valdez and Mock 1991). In contrast to other small coastal sites, NRL shows evidence of a full-time resi dent population; rich, deeply stratified Late to Terminal Classic de posits, specialized production of salt and salted fish, and access to an inordinate array of imported goods. As I have argued in previous papers (Mock 1994a, 1994b; Val dez and Mock 1991), sudden shifts in settlement or economic strat egies to peripheral coastal communities such as NRL during the Late to Terminal Classic period were precipitated by an imbalance between population and resources, environmental deterioration, and the breakdown of the socioeconomic and political matrix of many inland communities. This paper expands archaeological attempts to understand reactions to these changes during the Late to Termi nal Classic period in the Maya lowlands, using NRL as a concep tual stepping stone. Archaeological evidence points to linkages between NRL and the larger stone-tool-manufacturing community of Colha, 15 km inland from NRL and accessible by both water and land routes (Hester 1979; Hester et al. 1980, 1982; Mock 1994a; Figure 2). The proximity of the two sites and similarities in certain artifact types, particularly ceramics, suggests that the small NRL commu nity was a coastal transshipment station or seaport of Colha (An drews 1990:165, 1991). In this paper I focus on two specific points of inquiry: the eco logical and economic aspects of this inland-coastal relationship and the sociopolitical or ideological relations institutionalizing this dependency. At the same time I realize the reflexiveness of these processes and the inadequacy of these paradoxical terminologies to deal with the complexity of cultural factors guiding this pro posed relationship. Indeed the relative weight of each process in culture change may vary from context to context (Carneiro 1992:177). Ideology, in particular, has numerous metaphors of meaning in the anthropological literature (e.g., Demarest 1992). In this context, it is a symbolic template, a mechanism for the per ception, understanding, judgment, and manipulation of the world inherited from Maya predecessors (Geertz 1973:216-217). I pro pose that material-culture items, such as the polychrome ceramics addressed in this paper, not only reflect these processes, but were actively used in negotiating the changing relations of power be tween elites and nonelites. Although area specific, this study is one step in forging an un derstanding of the broader maze of intra- and intercommunity re lationships in northern Belize during the Late to Terminal Classic period. The community of NRL, although located on the fringes of Classic Maya civilization, was part of a larger and more com plex cultural whole of coastal-inland communities, all in turn affected by and interacting with region-wide events and circum stances. Interactions between coastal and inland communities were often dynamic and multidirectional, conditioned by factors such as the local ecology, the demand for and control of surplus re source production and distribution, the relations between surplus producers and consumers, and the sociopolitical or ideological tem plates guiding these relationships. Within a broader perspective, this study also contributes in sights into processes that produced the spatial, temporal, and or ganizational variability in the archaeological record and thus 165</page><page sequence="2">166 Hock Figure I.

EXCHANGE SPHERES IN NORTHERN BELIZE Among the material correlates of intensive exchange activities at NRL are the variety of ceramic forms and types, many of which are identical to those recovered at Colha (Mock 1994a; Valdez 1987). This diversity, in addition to the great volume of ceramics, elite goods, and other commodities such as obsidian or chert stemmed blades, is clearly greater than would be expected from a resident population in this small settlement, regardless of its pros perity. Similarly, the heterogeneity of artifact forms recovered at Moho Cay, located at the mouth of the Belize River south of NRL, led McKillop (1980) and Wilk (1978:6) to conclude that it was a</page><page sequence="3">Northern River Lagoon 1¿7 multipurpose transshipment center, coming to prominence during the Middle Classic period (a.d. 400-700). A corresponding expla nation was offered for Marlowe Cay (Craig 1966:24); both the char acteristics and abundance of diagnostic Late Classic to Postclassic artifacts suggest a relationship with the nearby, wealthy inland cen ter of Altun Ha. Wild Cane Cay (McKillop 1987, 1996) and sites on Ambergris Cay (Guderjan and Garber 1995; Guderjan et al. 1988, 1989) are similarly precocious, which substantiates their roles as transshipment points during this time period. My observations of sites at Rocky Point and Pott's Creek Landing, conjoined with ar tifact inventories of these sites made by Bennyhoff and Meighan (1952) in their 1950 field season, also support the characterization of these sites as transhipment stations for inland communities dur ing the Late to Terminal Classic period (Mock 1994a). Salt, the production of which is documented at NRL (Valdez and Mock 1991) and additional coastal sites in southern and north ern Belize (Graham 1983; Guderjan 1988,1995; Guderjan and Gar ber 1995; McKillop, 1994a, 1994b, 1995; MacKinnon and Kepecs 1989) undoubtedly played a crucial role in the dynamics of inland coastal exchange as well as more widespread exchange networks during the Late to Terminal Classic period (Graham 1975, 1978, 1983; Graham and Pendergast 1987; Guderjan 1988; Guderjan and Garber 1995; MacKinnon 1985, 1986, 1989; MacKinnon and Kepecs 1989; MacKinnon et al. 1989; McKillop 1987, 1994a, 1994b, 1995, 1996). Salt-preserved fish as well as salt may have ended up in the larders of inland elite during this time of resource deficiencies (Mock 1994a; Valdez and Mock 1991). Certainly NRL's ascendancy during the Late Classic period was facilitated by its role as a transshipment center or station, moving these lo cally produced surpluses in addition to imported commodities to inland communities such as Colha by water route or land transport (see Andrews 1980a, 1980b, 1983). NRL's location on a large la goon near the Northern River and access to the Caribbean put it in an ideal geographical locus for maritime trade. A continued impediment, however, in concerted, collaborative efforts to understand exchange networks is the fact that the archae ological identification of Maya port facilities remains ambiguous. One significant obstacle to identification is that Maya maritime trade did not normally require major structures to service trading canoes or to store trade goods. Structures associated with mari time trade have been tentatively identified on the coasts of Yuca tan (e.g., Andrews 1991; Andrews and Corletta 1995; Andrews et al. 1988) but nothing resembling these has been identified any where in northern Belize, except possibly on Ambergris Cay (Gud erjan 1988:217-218; Guderjan et al. 1988) or at Cerros (Robertson and Freidel 1986). An additional factor to consider in deducing empirical evi dence of port facilities is that coastal areas undergo myriad land scape modifications due to processes such as sea-level changes, mangrove intrusion, and hurricanes. Partially inundated sites have been reported on the northern coast at Moho Cay (McKillop 1980), Marco Gonzalez (Dunn and Mazullo 1993; Graham and Pen dergast 1989), San Juan and Yalamha on Ambergris Cay (Guder jan 1988), Cerros (Scarborough 1991), and numerous sites in southern Belize such as Placencia Cay (MacKinnon 1989) and Wild Cane Cay, Frenchman Cay, and Punta Acacias Lagoon sites (McKillop 1987, 1994a, 1994b, 1995, 1996). Original suspicions that the Northern River Lagoon environs of dense mangrove colonies were drastically different circa a.d. 670 900 were confirmed through the identification of macrobotanical specimens such as pine (Pinus sp.) and cedar (Cedrela mexicana) (which no longer grow in the area) in archaeological deposits re covered in the 1993 field season. Also substantiating this radical environmental change at NRL are inundated stone features and ar chaeological deposits in the site environs (Mock 1994a; see also Dunn and Mazzullo 1993). Hence, if trade-related features are ex tant they are probably submerged. The distribution of Late to Terminal Classic sites along the coast of northern Belize is significant not only in terms of the concentration of diverse ecological zones (Graham 1987, 1989; Rice 1987) with great economic potential, but also in terms of a landscape of interlinked rivers and lagoons binding these coastal settlements to a broader regional economy (Mock 1994a). Graham (1989:144-145) stresses that we must elucidate patterns of re source utilization on a restricted scale with a focus on patterns of local or intercommunity exchange before generalizing about in terregional dependencies or probable trade routes (see also Healy 1989:163). From an ecological perspective, Graham (1989) con siders the interdependencies of coastal and inland settlements: the Placencia sites with the inland site of Alabama, and the Rocky Point-Salt Creek sites and Marlowe Cay on Midwinter's Lagoon with the monumental center of Altun Ha. A similar ecological affiliation is posited for Lubaantun and Wild Cane Cay in south ern Belize (Hammond 1975, 1976:278; McKillop 1987, 1989). Graham (1989:145) appropriately cautions, however, against the assumption that all coastal and inland settlements are related in the same way. Other factors to consider, she argues, must be lo cal geomorphological processes, access to arable land, presence or absence of beach fronts, local resource availability, and envi ronmental changes. Not only were NRL and Colha linked by rivers and lagoons (see Figure 1) but a series of stone-lined roads or sacbes radiating from NRL in a north to northwest pattern possibly formed an ad ditional mosaic of socioeconomic linkages with the larger inland community (Figure 2) (Mock 1994a). By virtue of its centrality, Colha may have been able to facili tate subsistence procurement and spread environmental risk over its territory through control of or alliance with this remote coastal community. Control of NRL would also have enhanced Colha's access to exchange networks and strengthened its socioterritorial boundaries to the east. Accordingly, the community of NRL may have funneled surplus salt and salted resources to elite rulers at Colha, at the same time drawing agricultural products, stone tools, information, and populations, in addition to military protection, from the larger inland polity. Large quantities of imported goods, particularly ceramics, in the archaeological deposits substantiate NRL's wide-ranging trading connections, which moved goods di rectly from other coastal traders either for local circulation or ship ment to Colha (see also Jackson and McKillop 1989:93; McKillop 1996). The NRL lithic assemblage mirrors the community's consumer status and provides support for the posited exchange relationship with Colha during the Late to Terminal Classic period (Kelly 1980:56-60). Although chert outcrops are present in the NRL environs, they are decidedly inferior, a factor that undoubtedly ac counts for the paucity of primary lithic debitage in the archaeo logical deposits of NRL. Moreover, chert-tool forms display the distinctive attributes of the northern Belize chert located in and around the site of Colha (Mock 1994a; see also Hester et al. 1991; McAnany 1989, 1991; Shafer 1983; Shafer and Hester 1983). Of particular significance in light of arguments presented here is the prominence of small, stemmed blades (Figure 3a-j) in the archae</page><page sequence="4">168 Mock 0 20m L.J I I I Figure 2. Hap of Northern River Lagoon.</page><page sequence="5">Northern River Lagoon 169 a. b. c. d. Figure 3. Various chert forms imported from Colha: (a-c) unmodified blades; (d-e) blades with incipient stems; (f-j) stemmed blades. ological deposits (39% of the chert-tool collection), presumably shipped from specialized blade workshops at Colha (e.g., Roemer 1991:Figures 1-2; see also Meskill 1989). Obsidian-blade fragments are also represented in high densities (38.6% of the stone-tool collection) in the archaeological depos its, presumably due to NRL's privileged access to obsidian through coastal exchange networks (e.g., Dreiss 1988, 1989; Dreiss and Brown 1989; Dreiss et al. 1993; Mock 1994a). A total of 87% of the sourced samples from NRL comes from the El Chayal area; the remaining 13% are sourced as Ixtepeque (Dreiss et al. 1993:280). One small obsidian workshop (El Chayal) has been located at Colha; however, almost equal percentages of both Ixte peque (51%) and El Chayal (48%) obsidian occur in Late to Ter minal Classic deposits (Dreiss et al. 1993:275).</page><page sequence="6">170 Mock Figure 4.

PALMAR POLYCHROMES AS BOUNDARY MARKERS The marked similarities in the Late to Terminal Classic ceramic collections between NRL and Colha also represent some measure of the degree of interaction between the two communities. Of the more than six distinct polychrome types represented in the NRL collection, Palmar Orange-polychrome, a Late Classic horizon marker (Ball 1977:134; Gifford 1976:249), is well represented, 10cm Figure 5. Photograph of the Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherd with a monkey motif illustrated in Figure 4.</page><page sequence="7">Northern River Lagoon 171 Figure 6. Photograph and illustration of Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherd with vertical panels containing slashes and dog or monkey motif. occurring in great frequencies at all levels with little evidence of stylistic change during the span of occupation. Palmar Orange polychrome plates occur from NRL north to Colha and San Este van (Valdez 1994:4). Significant to the ideas presented in this paper is a particular style of Palmar Orange-polychrome plate (Figures 4 and 5) that occurs not only in great quantities at NRL but in Late to Terminal Classic deposits at Colha (Valdez 1987, 1994). Identical plates are also noted at Kichpanha, 12 km north of Colha (e.g., Reese and Valdez 1987; Shaw 1992, 1995). Sherds from these distinctive Pal mar Orange-polychrome vessels have not, however, been ob served at Pott's Creek, Salt Creek, or Midwinter's Lagoons south of NRL (Bennyhoff and Meighan 1952; Kelly 1980, 1987; Mock 1994a). Moreover, my own reconnaissance of two sites on Will Edward's Lagoon immediately north of NRL failed to recover any evidence of this particular style of Palmar Orange-polychrome plate.The distribution of this style of polychrome plate then, as presently known, is restricted to communities on a 15-km line run ning northwest from NRL to Colha and continuing 12 km north to Kichpanha (Gibson and Shafer 1982). Thus, this linear relation ship extends more than 27 km from the Northern River Lagoon, with Colha, presumably the controlling polity and manufacturing locus of the plates, almost equidistantly spaced between the two smaller communities (see Figure 1). Moreover, the saches radiat ing out from NRL follow this same northwesterly linear pattern. Under optimal conditions, Colha could easily access resources from NRL by land or more expeditiously by the Northern River and Quashie Banner Creek (Mock 1994a). COLHA AND NRL: AN ALLOCATION OF POWER Polychromes have traditionally been placed in the realm of elite goods, but this narrow view has been challenged by both archae ological context and stylistic analysis (Chase 1992; Reents-Budet</page><page sequence="8">172 Mock 1994:98), suggesting their accessibility to a larger stratum of so ciety. Undoubtedly polychromes functioned in a variety of roles in Classic Maya society, distributional differences or frequencies be ing due to factors such as the artistic quality of the polychromes or the vessel form. The archaeological evidence substantiates that Pal mar Orange-polychrome crosses status-related lines at NRL (Mock 1994a, 1995) and Colha (King 1990; Valdez 1987), being well rep resented in both elite and nonelite housemounds and trash depos its. In marked contrast to other polychrome types recovered at NRL, Palmar Orange-polychrome plates comprise approximately 20% of the total ceramic collection (Mock 1994a). This apparent ac cessibility to symbolically imbued goods such as the polychrome plates is crucial both in terms of its implications for the mainte nance of inland-coastal relationships and its appearance during the Late to Terminal Classic period in the southern Maya low lands. This was a period when competing ruling dynasties maneu vered to increase power (Sharer 1977:539; Willey 1974:426). As a result, a horizontal dimension was reflected in the diversity of the Late Classic ceramics (Willey et al. 1965), and the need for new and different types of information exchange arose (Wobst 1977). The distribution of Palenque's emblem glyph and certain ce ramics at sites in the immediate area has been cited as evidence for the center's political control (Hammond 1982:226). This Clas sic Maya polity structure contained many types of population ag gregates extending from its core, some of which consisted of rulers who, when faced with the breakdown of central control, arrogated their own symbols of power to their communities or kin groups (Hammond 1991:281). Similarly, Fash and Stuart (1991:168— 177) argue that the need to gain additional support at Copan dur ing the Late to Terminal Classic period may have motivated the ruler Yax Pac to confer the Copan emblem glyph on local nobles. I propose that the Colha rulers used similar strategies in the face of increasing demographic pressures, environmental uncertain ties, and social unrest during the Late to Terminal Classic period. As Geertz (1973:219) cogently observes, "It is when neither a so ciety's most general cultural orientations nor its most down-to earth, 'pragmatic' ones suffice any longer to provide an adequate image of political processes that ideologies begin to become cru cial as sources of sociopolitical meanings and attitudes." As the former political order fades into irrelevance, either the old sym bolic framework must be transformed or a new framework must be sought. Those in power may attempt to resolve ambiguity and smooth over contradiction by employing skilled craftsmen to en code artistic products with symbolic messages conveying a uni fied point of view (Brumfiel and Earle 1987:9; Geertz 1973:221). The messages encoded on such artistic products may also reflect greater intrasociety ties or greater dichotomy between groups (Hod der 1979). The ubiquity of this particular style of polychrome plate at NRL and Colha suggests attempts by the ruling elite to fashion the past into into a new symbolic template of group affiliation (Beaudry 1988:46), not only to reinforce political boundaries but to perpet uate the matrix of economic relationships. Colha, although not a typical monumental site, was a large polity with a burgeoning stone tool industry during the Late Classic. Mechanisms of control or alliance may have been necessary to inculcate group identity and compliance in a society in which traditional Classic Maya values were challenged. Moreover, perpetuating their positions of power through a continued supply of salt, salted fish, and trade goods from the coastal transshipment port of NRL, whether a colony or ally, would have been a priority of Colha's ruling elite. Follow ing the strategies of elite rulers at other Maya polities such as Pa lenque and Copan during the Late Classic, I propose that the economic relationship between Colha and NRL was further insti tutionalized by fashioning a shared ideology infused with symbols drawn from the Classic order. This religious/political template was embodied in lower-quality, mass-produced polychrome plates em ulating ceramics traditionally and historically restricted to elite consumption. MONKEY BUSINESS AT COLHA AND NRL I now turn to the subject of the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates and their iconography to assist in the task of eliciting the ideolog ical factors institutionalizing bonds between the two communi ties. Technological and morphological analysis confirm that the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates from Colha and NRL clearly reflect a single production system, the standardization showing up in the form, stylistic treatment, slip, paste composition, and a con Figure 7. Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherds: top, monkey figure rest ing on band border; bottom, anthropomorph with feather.</page><page sequence="9">Northern River Lagoon 173 sistent recurring cluster of iconographic patterns (Rice 1981, 1989:310-311). A strong correlation exists also between the decorative structure and identification with a community (Rice 1989:310). According to Rice (1981:222), these traits reflect not only the "ceramic resources of the production locus and the spe cific ways in which the potters utilize those resources in response to demand" but also a "cultural tradition, that is a range of inter related beliefs, concepts, and ideas developed over time and space." Like other small communities in Belize, NRL did not display the typical indices of the Classic Maya "Great Tradition" such as stelae, hieroglyphic texts, ostentatious monumental structures, or ballcourts. The larger inland center of Colha itself lacks stelae and hieroglyphic texts. Although building construction and renovation did occur at Colha (e.g., Structure 2035), it did not reach the con spicuous display characteristic of some centers during the Late to Terminal Classic period (Eaton 1994:106-107). Despite the obvi ous absence of these indices, I argue that NRL and Colha were participants in the mainstream of Maya society, their elites des perately adhering to but at the same time transforming the Classic Maya paradigm of divine rulers and sacred beliefs so firmly an chored in the ideology. To support my stance I offer the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates recovered at both NRL and Colha, replete with icono graphic evidence suggesting connections to a recurrent theme in Maya iconography: events occurring in the epic tale of creation, the Popol Vuh. To those who would deem this a paradigm that has worn out its welcome in interpretations of Maya iconography, I proceed with the caveat that other nonsurviving versions of this literary work may have guided the pictoral themes represented on the plates (Reents-Budet 1994:278), especially, the intertwined ad ventures of the Hero Twins and monkeys. No complete plates have been recovered at either NRL or Colha, but rim sherds suggest a large plate with an average rim diameter of 40-60 cm. The iconographic patterns, certainly crudely ex ecuted by Classic Maya standards, are better preserved at NRL due to the unique preservation at the site created by the rapid in Figure 8. Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherds: top, mon key with deformed head; bottom, monkey with curled tail.</page><page sequence="10">174 Mock undation of deposits following abandonment. Plate bottoms, al though few, are distinguished by shallow ring bases (although one plate has small nubbin feet). A notable signature of the large, mass produced polychrome plates from both Colha and NRL is the two interior circumferential registers of iconographic elements sepa rated by red and black single or double bands with wavy or dotted line panels. Vertical panels within each circumferential band frame abstract or naturalistic motifs. The top circumferential register dis plays a framing motif composed of three vertical panels, each of which displays groups of short vertical slashes (Figure 6). Some of the panels display no slashes, while the number of slashes in other panels varies from 1 to 10, with four slashes being the most com mon. This attention to detail in the execution of motifs suggests the number of slashes was of importance, possibly functioning as a type of counting or record-keeping device; however, until complete plates are recovered this interpretation must remain conjecture. The actions and attributes of human heroes, animals, and com posite, mythical creatures are often complexly interwoven in Clas sic Maya texts and iconography (Reents-Budet 1994:234-289), traditions which are reiterated in the iconographic inventory on the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates. Colha and NRL share many identical iconographic motifs, with the exception of squirrels and turkeys noted in the Colha collection (Gutierrez 1994). As the de signs on the Colha plates are more eroded and faint, it is possible that this is simply a matter of individual interpretation. A notable characteristic of the both the Colha and NRL plates are the cavorting monkey figures with curled tails (see Figure 4). Some of the painted figures from NRL are obviously simian in nature, marked by snouts, tufted hair, and sloping foreheads (Fig ures 7 and 8, top), while others are more ambiguous, displaying Maya characteristics such as slanted eyes and head deformation (Figure 9). 10c Figure 9. Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherds: top, an thropomorph with blood spots; middle, disembodied head on band border; bottom, figure with truncated arm.</page><page sequence="11">Northern River Lagoon 175 A few portraits display the refined features of the Maya noble, while others feature the disarrayed hair and coarse features more characteristic of captives (Figure 9). Occasionally the head alone is shown resting on a painted band (see Figure 9, middle and bot tom) recalling the "disembodied head" shown so frequently on Clas sic Maya polychrome plates (Coe 1989:167; Smith 1955:2a). Drawing on events in the Popol Vuh, the solitary head may repre sent the decapitated head of Hun Hunahpu or First Father. Classic Maya artists often depicted his severed head lying on a plate in the Otherworld (Coe 1978:83, 1982:92; Freidel et al. 1995:216). Hun Hunahpu also represents the maize god, whose death and rebirth represent the annual agricultural cycle (Coe 1989:167). Occasional groups of red dots appearing above the head of these animal/human creatures depicted on the NRL plates may repre sent blood (see Figure 9, top and middle). In one instance (see Figure 9, bottom) the truncated hand of a human/monkey figure Figure 10. Photograph and illustration of Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherd with mat and monkey-tail design.</page><page sequence="12">176 Mock recalls an event in the Popol Vuh in which an angry Seven Macaw (Vucub Caquix) seizes Hunahpu's arm and tears it off (Tedlock 1985:92). In other instances a monkey tail in the lower register border represents an abbreviated reference to a simian figure (Fig ure 10) descending into the Underworld (Kerr 1992:391). The monkey was a very popular motif in the Late Classic dec orative repertoire before the Classic Maya collapse, its popularity continuing today as monkey impersonators lead community ritu als in parts of highland Guatemala and Chiapas (Freidel et al. 1995:289-291). Both the spider (chuen) and the howler (hatz) mon key occurred in several permutations in Classic Maya texts and iconography (Coe 1977:346). As recounted in the Popol Vuh, the ungrateful wooden people did not perform the necessary rituals to the gods of creation, thus their descendants were turned into mon keys (Tedlock 1985:35). The twin half brothers of the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh, Hun Baatz (One Howler Monkey) and Hun Chuen (One Spider Monkey) were known as sages and diviners who were also turned into monkeys (Baker 1992:219; Edmonson 1971:92 93). This attribution explains their association with mirrors (Miller and Taube 1993:135) and may account for the presence of the rep tilian eye as an prominent iconographic motif on the polychrome plates (Figure 11), given that mirror and eye were metaphors in ancient Mesoamerica (Hunt 1977:146). Mirrors, in their capacity Figure 11. Examples of the reptilian-eye motif depicted on Palmar Orange polychrome plate sherds. to see future events, have also been connected to rituals creating, affirming, and recreating royal identity and legitimacy (Saunders 1988; see also Miller and Taube 1993:80). The monkey was also associated with painting, writing, dancing, music, and giving shape to things through crafts such as silversmith ing and carving (Coe 1977:328; Miller and Taube 1993:117-118). Hence, in this iconographic context the monkey may also be asso ciated with stone-tool fabricators at Colha or saltmaking traders at NRL, the emblem of an emerging class of specialist elite during the Late Classic period. As Helms (1993:52-53) observed, skilled arti sans are frequently accorded rewards and honors because of their ex ceptional power. This often placed them in esteemed, highly privileged positions. Additional figures in the restricted repertoire of motifs dis played on NRL plates are long-necked water birds (Figure 12, top), incensarios (Figure 12, bottom), turtles, and snakes. The bottom of a plate, delineated by the two registers of bands with icono graphic elements, usually displays either a deer or celestial crea ture with deer ears, a large feathered motif (also see Gutierrez 1994), or an abstract design with interior red dots. Deer ears worn by the figures may be connected to death symbolism (Figure 13) (Scheie and Miller 1986:141). Deer ears are also worn by other creatures or "beasties" (Scheie 1989:146), such as the Vision Serpent, which inhabit the Maya world, possibly symbolizing their transforma tive nature. Coe singles out the deer as an important chthonic su pernatural, postulating its connections to the Hero Twins (Adams 1971:Figure 37; Coe 1989:17). He also provides the example of a deer ritual depicted on a polychrome vessel, which takes place in the Underworld or Xibalba, in which the Hero Twins are promi nent participants (Coe 1989:176). Both deer and dogs were among the sacrificial offerings in cuch or renewal rites. Dogs, featured on the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates, are also prominent iconographic motifs (Figure 14) on painted Figure 12.

Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherds: top, celestial creature with deer ear; bottom, deer-like creature. Maya pots. In their role as Xolotl, dogs guided their masters to the underworld and across bodies of water. In the Popol Vuh, the wily Hero Twins, performing in the court of the lords of death, sacrifice a dog and bring it back to life (Miller and Taube 1993:80). Various real and mythical trees were also prominent symbols in ancient Mesoamerica, often acquiring associations with spe cific supernatural beings (Hunt 1977:94). Stepped, fruit-laden trees displaying plain or kan crosses (Figure 15) may simultaneously represent pyramidal structures or stairs, the two often connected to the axis mundi or center of the world (Freidel et al. 1993). The tree itself, a creative center of action, is often used to define sa cred space or as a metaphor for ahau or political authority (Frei del 1992:127). The Hero Twins were able to outsmart their twin brothers, Hun Batz and Hun Chuen, luring them into a tree where they became monkeys (Miller and Taube 1993:134-135). Stepped, fruit-laden trees may also allude to decapitation events and cap tives, since in another section of the Popul Vuh, Hun Hunahpu's decapitated head was hung in a gourd tree, thus seeding the Hero Twins. A major theme in Maya iconography is the severed head of First Father rising out of the sacrificial plate prior to resurrec tion (Freidel et al. 1995:71). The tree/pyramidal iconographic mo tifs may reiterate the use of human skulls in the Maya ballgame played on the stairs of monumental structures. Valdez (personal communication 1994) has suggested that Palmar Orange polychrome plates were thrown down the steps of one pyramidal structure at Colha (Structure 2012) during a termination ritual. The plates were arguably the focus of ritual behavior, for on another occasion the broken sherds were carefully and deliber ately stacked around the base of this pyramidal structure (Conger 1986). Mat motifs also occur on the polychrome plates from NRL. One interwoven pattern occurs inside an incensario motif edged with flame elements (see Figure 12, bottom), while another is a gui lloche twist juxtaposed next to a monkey tail (see Figure 10). Mats were important furnishings for many noble or priestly dwellings and served as symbols in important ritual events such as marriages and divinations. Moreover, an important focus of Yucatan ritual was the mat house or the popol nah, on which the mat not only served as an emblem of rulership but symbolized the interweaving or conjoin ing of different political groups (Rice 1989; Tedlock 1985:345). In the Quiche state during the reign of Quicab, the heads of vassal lin eages received the title "Keeper of the Mat" (Tedlock 1985:345). A similar emblem of power, symbolically embodied in the polychrome plates, may have been arrogated by Colha rulers to a growing class of wealthy craft specialists at Colha and NRL. Certainly traders, or even highly skilled chert-tool fabricators (possibly lineages tradi tionally employed in these occupations) would have been drawn into this network of affiliation. Although the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates cannot be def initely identified as ceremonial in function on the basis of the archaeological context alone, iconography provides linkages to events related in the Popol Vuh or an earlier version, suggesting the plates were used in ritualistic, community-wide contexts at both NRL and Colha. Certainly the lack of whole plates recov ered in the archaeological deposits limits our understanding of the complete picture, especially in terms of the combination and relationships of iconographic motifs depicted on the register bands. Recall Landa's observation that human sacrifices were placed on large plates, or zuhuy lac (Tozzer 1941:119). Although the great numbers of broken plates present in the archaeological deposits at NRL might discount this particular use, it is plausible that the plates held other sacrificial offerings such as tamales or foods eaten in community rituals (Reents-Budet 1994:80). An alternate explanation might be offered also for the great numbers of bro ken plates: they were manufactured for use in a one-time ritual event, being smashed or sacrificed at its termination. The latter is certainly a strong possibility considering the Mayan concern with dedication and containment rituals (Mock 1997; Scheie and Frei del 1990:106, 127, 428). During the Late to Terminal Classic, during a period of social disequilibrium and environmental uncertainties in some commu nities, rulers and subjects alike may have propitiated the supernat</page><page sequence="14">178 Mock Figure 14. Photograph and illustration of Pal mar Orange-polychrome plate sherd depicting a dog. ural with ritualistic intensity and use of symbols attempting to reaffirm or reconfirm the traditional social order. Certainly these iconographic motifs—albeit attenuated, crudely executed forms of their Classic Maya counterparts—offer us insight into the ideol ogy of this cultural arena on the fringes of Late Classic Maya civilization. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES In this paper I have stimulated insights into processes underlying the ascendancy of the coastal community of NRL in relation to the larger inland community of Colha during the Late to Terminal Clas sic period. I have proposed that the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates functioned as a sort of ideological currency maintaining and reinforcing socioeconomic and political boundaries of a Colha ruled interaction sphere (and possibly Kichpanha [Shaw 1992, 1995]). At the same time, this geographically restricted message, reified in iconographic motifs painted on the Palmar Orange polychrome plates, may have been intended to instill unity in an increasingly atomized and heterogeneous society. Reiterating a Classic Maya charter such as the one promulgated by the Popol Vuh, these plates became increasingly accessible to social groups in both the inland center, Colha, and its transshipment station, NRL. Moreover, iconographical motifs such as monkeys may have served as symbols of a new class of growing elite specialists. Although the archaeological data at this time limit the exten sion of these ideas, they serve as metaphors in guiding the present study and future research at NRL centered on inland-coastal re lationships. Additional field research focused on the spatial distri</page><page sequence="15">Northern River Lagoon 179 Figure 15. Photograph and illustration of Palmar Orange-polychrome plate sherd depicting a stepped tree with crosses and monkey tail. bution of the Palmar Orange-polychrome plates and ongoing pet rographic and neutron-activation analysis synthesized with the sty listic and typological classifications will corroborate, modify, or expand the interpretations offered here (e.g., Rands 1967; Rands and Bishop 1980). Iceland's (1994) recent petrographic studies of ceramic samples from Colha and Kichpanha, for example, show great promise in that they reveal a correlation between ceramic type, mineralogical composition, and production methods at the two sites. Since the NRL Palmar Orange-polychrome plates were probably manufactured at Colha, technological studies have great utility in fine tuning geographic patterning, thus assisting in the task of understanding the dynamics of political boundaries in north ern Belize. Evidence suggests that the NRL settlement was abandoned at the same time that the inhabitants of Colha (and possibly Kich panha) witnessed their own demise, perhaps the casualties of well-intended but futile attempts to assure their survival during deteriorating environmental conditions and socioeconomic stress. Evidence of deliberate building destruction at an elite structure and the execution of 30 elite victims and placement of their flayed skulls in a hastily dug pit located at the inside corner of stairs, layered with broken Palmar Orange-polychrome plates and other ceramics, may represent vivid testimony to the end of Colha's po litical ascendancy (Hester et al. 1980, 1982; Massey 1989; Steele et al. 1980; Mock 1994a, 1994b; Valdez 1987). Subsequent to the interment the adjacent structure was burned, thus collapsing over the skull pit. Smashed Palmar Orange-polychrome plates were also scattered over the surfaces of other monumental structures at Colha as part of the ritual abandonment (Fred Valdez, personal commu nication 1995; see also Krochock [1995] for evidence of a similar termination ritual). Traces of incised, red-slipped, Tulum-like Post classic sherds recovered at Colha and on the surface of Late to Terminal Classic deposits at NRL may also signal the arrival of intrusive social groups bearing new ideological traditions and ter ritorial ambitions to challenge the ruling elite's best-laid strategies of maintaining political boundaries and allocating power. RESUMEN Trabajo de campo en progreso en el sitio costero de Northern River La goon (NRL) en Belize septentrional, el objecto de más de una década de investigaciones de prospección regional conducidas por el Proyecto Colha, revela evidencia de manufactura de sal especializada, preservación de pescado, y acceso a una gran variedad de bienes importados tales como cerámica y obsidiana durante la transición del período clásico tardío a ter minal. Yo he propuesto que el asentamiento en estos sitios remotos re spondió a una falta de balance entre población y recursos, deterioro medio ambiental, y desintegración de la matriz socioeconómica y política en mu chas comunidades de tierra adentro durante este período. Se ha avanzado la hipótesis de una relación de consumidor con el centro productor de her ramientas líticas Colha, basada en el alto número de las distintivas cuchi llas hechas en Colha presentes en NRL. Colha, accesible por medio de un sistema de vías acuáticas interconectadas y sacbes, es presumiblemente el centro que controló esta relación, mientras que NRL fue el puerto de em barque. El análisis del inventario cerámico de ambas comunidades revela que esta relación económica fue reforzada por una ideología compartida. Estas comunidades no solamente comparten tipos cerámicos pero también tiestos de idénticos platos Palmar anaranjado-polícromo recuperados en ambos sitios. De particular importancia en el inventario iconográfico rep resentado en los platos en ambos sitios es un mono estilizado. Cerámica polícroma, usualmente exclusiva de la élite maya durante el clásico, ocurre en gran cantidad en una variedad de contextos clásicos tardío—terminales tanto en Colha como en NRL, sugiriendo accesibilidad a un amplio rango de consumidores. Esta reiteración sugiere un sistema de símbolos com partidos perpetuado por los líderes para negociar relaciones cambiantes de poder y reforzar límites políticos durante un tiempo de tumulto político y social. El estudio de esta relación tierra adentro-costa provee un avance conceptual para entender la estructura del intercambio tierra adentro-costa de los antiguos mayas, y las esferas ideológicas en Belize septentrional durante el clásico tardío-terminal, por lo tanto facilitando comparaciones entre áreas locales en un contexto regional.
