<plain_text><page sequence="1">SECURITY AND SANCTITY: THE ECCLESIASTICAL METALWORK OF LOUGH KINALE ANTIQUITIES Security and Sanctity: the Ecclesiastical Metalwork of Lough Kinale As conservation draws to a close on the 8th-century Lough Kinale book shrine, EAMONN P KELLY evaluates this cumhdach, together with a number of ecclesiastical objects to go on display at the National Museum later this year 1 Detail of the book shrine cover showing openwork and cast decoration in the Ultimate La T?ne style 2 The main face of the Lough Kinale shrine is dominated by a cross with cusped sides ough Kinale is a small lake located on the River Inny where the counties Longford, Westmeath and Cavan meet. In 1986, divers discovered a group of decorated objects on the lake bed, close to a small crann?g (an artifi cially constructed island settlement) offshore of Tonymore North, about five miles east of the town of Granard in Co Longford. The finds were the compo nents of an early medieval shrine, already fragmentary when it was deposited in the lake. But despite a small number of missing components, a full reconstruction has been possible. The shrine consists of a wooden box to which metal plates were nailed, the whole being bound with tubular strips along the sides and corners. Once closed it would not have been possible to gain access to the contents without disas sembling the box. For this reason and the iconographie nature of the decoration, the object has been identified as a reliquary, more pre cisely a cumhdach or book shrine. Because of its status as a holy relic, the manuscript, once enshrined, was intended to remain so. Decorated lavishly in the Ultimate La T?ne style, with particular attention being paid to the cover (Figs 2 6k 4), the shrine is dominated by a cross with cusped sides, embellished with five cast bronze bosses and four gilt bronze openwork panels of animal interlace (Fig 1 ). Gilt openwork ornament, highlighted by tinned backing plates is also present around the borders of the cover and on medallions that decorate the cover and sides (Fig 10). Much of the cast and openwork decoration relies on the use of spirals with clubbed or bird-headed termi nals, which are a stylised representation of the classical 'inhabited vine' motif that is sym bolic of the Eucharist. Trumpet, lentoid motifs and opposed peltae are also in abundance. Cast zoomorphic ornament is present on the frame of the cross arms in the form of opposed birds and as projecting animal heads on the side and end medallions, while inscribed animal ornament decorate the strap fittings attached to the ends. Amber studs enrich the main face, some having inlaid metal grilles in the shape of an expanded arm cross. The design of the cover is reminiscent of that seen on the carpet pages of insular 1 06 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW SPRING 2006</page><page sequence="2">I*'*' 1*;' '\ *'' * S?MM - ..^m^r-y; Sgjp :?5 .. ; r gospel books, many of which are dominated by a large cross. An insular gospel book known as the Canterbury Codex Aureus, has cross forms with cusped arms that are closely comparable. The Book of Durrow provides a similar example of border decoration along the long sides that differ from those along the short sides. On later Irish book shrines, a cross is usually the major design element found on the cover and, analysis indicates that the pres ence of a cross as the dominant motif on the cover of the Lough Kinale book shrine indicates that it contained a gospel book. It was probably a large illuminated gospel book of 7th or early 8th century date, associated with a saint of some importance, whose identity remains unknown. Both the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow were enshrined during the 9th or 1 Oth centuries but the shrines have been lost. A book shrine known as the Domnach Airgid has some decorative elements that date to the 9th century, but this was reconstructed substantially and re embellished in the 14th century. Four book shrines (St Dimma, Stowe Missal shrine, Cathach and Misach), were made in the 11th-12th centuries with re-embellishment during the 14th-16th centuries, while the book shrines of St Moiling and St Caillinn date to the 15th and 16th centuries respectively. The shrines that postdate the Lough Kinale book shrine use precious metals such as silver and gold for embellishment and they display a high standard of artistry and design.

Enshrined books were regarded as important relics as they contained literally, the Word of God, transcribed on manuscripts that were associated with major saints. St Patrick is twice associated and St Columcille three times, while other saints were Cronan, MacCairtainn, Molaise, Maelruan, Cairneach, Moiling and Caillinn. The Lough Kinale book shrine was probably enshrined during the late 8th century or early 9th century. Inscriptions, which are a common feature on shrines from the 10th century onwards, are absent which may indicate that it was lost prior to then. The pres ence of fittings for a carrying-strap implies that the shrine was paraded on special occasions. Measuring 34.5cm x 26.5cm x 9.6cm, the Lough Kinale book shrine is the earliest and largest of the Irish book shrines and it is likely to have been produced under the patronage of a local king. The loss or deposi tion of the shrine in close proximity to a crann?g I is unlikely to have been fortuitous and it is likely that the Lough Kinale book shrine was kept nor mally at Tonymore North crann?g.

Although it is undecorated, a strap end (Fig 6c) associated with the satchel appears to date to the late 6th or early 7th cen tury - which would indicate that the chalice and paten from Lough Kinale are the earliest examples to have been found in Ireland. The chalice, which is 7.6cm in height, is of beaten silver with a deep cup (Fig 3). It has a one-piece hollow stem with a cen tral swelling and a domed foot with a foot-ring that are con nected by a large pin, the domed head of which appears in the base of the cup. An applied copper alloy lip, held in position by three tags lapped over and riveted in place, caps the rim. A band of gilding runs just below the rim. Although intact when found, the paten suffered extensive damage before coming into the possession of the museum. It con sisted of a small circular plate with a rolled-over lip formerly mounted on a domed foot of beaten metal similar to the foot of the chalice. The plate was held to the foot by a rivet. The foot is largely intact but the plate, which had a diameter of just under 10cm, is fragmentary. There is a further object from Ballywillin crann?g for which a late 6th to early 7th century date can be suggested. Of copper alloy, it is decorated with a curvilinear design in the Ultimate La T?ne style, incorporating three spirals and trumpet motifs with the background cut away to highlight the design (Fig 6B). In form and design a mount on a late 6th-century house-shaped shrine from Clonmore, Co Armagh bears strong comparison. Two other objects from Ballywillin may also be mounts from a house-shaped reliquary. A conical gilt copper alloy boss that has a setting on the top with a slight internal lip to hold a stud is probably of 8th or early 9th century date (Fig 11C). The dec oration in the Ultimate La T?ne style is not easy to parallel, con sisting of four raised circular areas linked and interspaced by opposed trumpets. The design may be a variant of the egg and dart motif, a decorative device that is of Classical origin and which is present on a range of insular metalwork. A triangular shaped, anthropomorphic mount, showing a head in relief at the apex, above a body with splayed legs, may have been a gable 1 08 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW SPRING 2006</page><page sequence="4">ornament for a house-shaped shrine of 9th century date (Fig 9). A plain ecclesiastical bell with a date range of 600-900 AD was also found on Ballywillin crann?g (Fig 8). Made from iron coated in cop per alloy, it is of a type that shows a strong con centration in the midlands where the majority of examples occur. A small enamelled bell crest was found on the lake bed between Tonymore North crann?g and Ballywillin crann?g (Fig 11 A). It consisted of a cone, decorated with bands of yellow enamel, with a ring at the apgftStf and two long narrow curved flanges, diam^^H cally opposed, that spring from the base. Q|???| flange is complete and incised lightly wit|IB|| long sinuous foliate design based on an acar^H thus tendril. Part of a second similar bell crest, found at Ballywillin crann?g, consists of a con ical portion surmounted by a loop with deco ration in the form of five incised rows of running chevrons (Fig 7). Originally two flanges were present that consisted of strips of sheet metal folded over two transverse bars, of which one survives. It has been proposed that similar crested bells found elsewhere may be the product of a school of metalwork, probably at Roscommon, associated with the early 12th century High King, Turloch O'Connor. An 8th or early 9th-century AD glass stud in a copper alloy collet from Ballywillin crann?g has a domed head that held a metal grille (Fig 12). It was decorated with a key pattern design in the form of a double-framed equal-armed Latin cross with chevrons orientated diagonally in the spaces between the arms. A rope moulding is present on the collet. The stud is of a high order of workmanship and would have decorated an important item of ecclesiastical metalwork. Similar studs are to be found on the Ardagh chalice, on the rim of the Derrynaf Ian paten (Fig 13) and on a house-shaped shrine found near Tully on Lower Lough Erne, Co Fermanagh. None of the ecclesiastical finds from Lough Kinale date from later than the 12th century, although the crann?gs appear to have continued in use as secular residences until the end of the Middle Ages. The Discovery Programme, in association with the National Museum, will publish a monograph later this year on the archaeology of Lough Kinale. The Lough Kinale chalice is displayed currently in Kildare Street in the exhibition on Viking Age Ireland. The conservation programme, run by Dr The design of the cover is reminiscent of that seen on the carpet pages of insular gospel books, many of which are dominated by a large cross Paul Mullarkey of the museum's Conservation Department has been operating since early 1987. Because of the composite nature of the cumhdach, which contains metal, wood and amber, the work has been complex, as techniques designed to stabilize one part of the shrine could well have a deteriorating effect on the other elements. Most of the work has involved the mechanical removal of encrusta tions, one tiny section at a time, using a high-powered microscope to view the surface. This lengthy programme of conservation on the book shrine is now drawing to a close and it is planned that it too will be placed on permanent display during 2006.
