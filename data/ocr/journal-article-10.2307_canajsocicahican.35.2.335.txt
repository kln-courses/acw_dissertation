Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana  State University Press, 2008, 240 pp. $US 22.95 paper (978- 0-8071-3369-9) Diane M. Rodgers has assembled a diverse set of actors in Debugging the Link between Social Theory and Social Insects: ants, bees, biolo- gists, sociologists, and entomologists. They are seamlessly threaded into  a deconstruction of the metaphors and analogies used in the lively en- gagement between sociology and entomology in the nineteenth and early  twentieth centuries. On the one hand, social insects, such as ants, bees,  and wasps, were compared to human social organization. On the other  hand, a much larger repository of comparison, from human society back  to insects, provided explanations of insect sociality, carrying Western  conceptions of race, gender, and class into the classification and docu- mentation of the behaviour of social insects. Rodgers carefully analyzes the interconnected lines of thought be- tween sociologists and entomologists that, by her reckoning, co-con- structed interchangeable visions of sociality and social organization be- tween human and insect society. The book begins with an overview of  entomological terms and of the basic hierarchical model of sociality for  insects. Insect hierarchies are traditionally ranked from the most solitary  insects to the most socially organized or eusocial, such as some bees and  ants. The eusocial insects exhibit specialized behaviours such as a div- ision of labour, including reproductive labour, and caring for their insect  larvae. This sociality is the basis for the author’s claim that concepts de- ployed by entomologists have been “co-constructed with social theory” to  define aspects of sociality. It is around this point that her analysis unfolds. Applying a critical science studies approach, Rodgers tunnels into the  “process of legitimation” created through the development of a shared  lexicon of sociality between entomology and sociology. Through dis- course analysis, she reveals the underlying power relations within early  descriptions of human and social insect social organization that turned  on anthropomorphic accounts of insect behaviour. For example, ants  and bees were invariably described as stealthy invader, reserve labourer,  Queen, slave, soldier, farmer, and nurse, and were ascribed behaviours  such as “effective policing” or “corrupt motives.” The hierarchical social  institutions and roles used to describe social insects created a “legitimat- © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 35(2) 2010 335 </page> <page sequence="2"> 336 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 35(2) 2010 ing loop between social and natural systems [which] co-created class,  race, and gender hierarchies.” The book’s middle chapters emphasize  how dominant discourses of the colonial era, when so much early work  in entomology and sociology became entwined, were reflected in the  racialized terms ascribed to insect behaviour and roles, as, for instance,  slave and slave-maker ants, alongside notions of caste and gender. Social  insects were assigned roles and positions in insect society that mimicked  human practices. The author suggests that as these “biased descriptions  [of social structure] became part of the scientific discourse on nature,”  they were naturalized, serving as universals permeating the explanations  of complex human and insect behaviour and societies. As the book proceeds from explaining insect sociality and its rel- evance to human sociality through the historical and interdisciplinary  exchanges between entomologists, biologists, and sociologists, the  ghosts of theory past are scattered across the pages. Rodgers documents  in scholarly and archival sources the links between disciplines, involv- ing Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Peter Kropotkin, Henry Morton  Wheeler, Franklin Giddings, Robert Park, and Radhakamal Mukerjee,  with references among all to Durkheim, Weber, and Comte. A dizzying  array of male, mostly white scientists and sociologists discussed and de- bated the origins of sociality. One chapter is devoted to the few oppositional discourses or “al- ternative visions” of social insects based in feminism, cooperation, and  postcolonialism. However, Rodgers fails to highlight that the opposition- al discourses were not so much a redress of the dominant metaphors and  analogies deployed in descriptions of insect and human sociality, as an  extension of them to suit an alternative structure, purpose or behaviour.  Thus when Charlotte Perkins Gilman championed the benefits of what  she understood to be female-centred insect societies, she turned to the  same universals of sociality as her colleagues. The social organization  and highly efficient coordination of ants and bees were now described  as socialist or communist; the industry of female worker insects stood as  an example of how human government could become more attuned to  female purposes and needs — a sort of compassionate governance mod- eled on the honey bee. Rodgers’ book can be situated in literature that has recently explored  the “insect boom,” in which insect behaviour has been used to model  self-organizing human collectives, networks, and artificial intelligence  and artificial life computational systems. In these more recent instances,  sociologists have sought metaphorical inspiration from entomologists  asserting that insect sociality, while exhibiting complex organizational  features, are not necessarily strictly hierarchical, and that seemingly  </page> <page sequence="3"> Book review/Compte rendu: deBugging the link       337 complex behaviours emerge out of self-organization. In her final chapter,  the author notes that these more recent findings disturb long held notions  of insect sociality, but cautions that this renewed interdisciplinary cor- respondence between entomology and sociology might still be informed  by “embedded terms and assumptions” that do not necessarily challenge  race, class and gender hierarchies. This observation might have been a place to discuss one of the central  debates in science studies, which is present in this book but not explicit- ly confronted: the nature/culture divide. Although it explores the social  construction of nature, the book often maintains rather than challenges  the separation of nature and culture that many science studies scholars  have sought to disrupt. The “legitimating loop” co-constructed by ento- mologists and sociologists not only embedded social hierarchy, it also  maintained the division between nature and culture. Insects exhibit so- cial organization analogous to human society, but they were very clearly  not on the side of culture as far as entomologists and sociologists were  concerned. This division, I suggest, was crucial to the racialized construc- tions embedded in both human and insect sociality because it categorized  indigenous, non-white peoples on the side of nature (uncivilized), not cul- ture (civilized). Thus, the dialogue between entomologists and sociolo- gists is not only an example of interdisciplinarity and the co-construction  of a shared lexicon, it is yet another example of how two significant and  influential scholarly disciplines worked to keep nature and culture separ- ate. Later chapters seem to forget that the “legitimating loop” privileges  this nature/culture divide, ensuring that descriptions of nature remain  idealized abstractions available for theory-building in the one direction  (sociology) and for making nature understandable through human terms  in the other (entomology). Minor criticisms aside, this book serves as a model for critical science  studies. It highlights naturalizing tendencies that might prevail in current  research and theorizing on sociality in entomology and sociology, as well  as in recent studies in communication and networks. I recommend it to  students of science and sociology, as an example of early interdisciplin- arity and for its critical methodology applied to such a fascinating topic.
