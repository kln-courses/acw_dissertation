ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE Leonard Gorelick and A. John Gwinnett School of Dental Medicine, S. U.N.Y at Stonybrook I. PHILOLOGICAL EVIDENCE' 1. The U2-stone in "Lugal" The Sumerian myth "Lugal"2 tells the story of how Ninurta overcame the monster Asag, turned it into stone, fashioned the mountains with the new material, and channeled the water of the melting snow into the Tigris, thus creating the yearly flooding of the river. In his fight against Asag he was helped by Sarur, his personified mace; Asag in turn could rely on its offspring, personified stones that had organized themselves into an evil kingdom (lines 34-38): kur-ra ?a3 i3-ni-bal numun-bi ba-tal2-tal2 tel2-ba mu bi2-ib-sa4 na4.U2 lugal-bi-ge3 muru2-ba am-gal-gin7 a2 ba-ni-ib2-il2-il2-i na4.su-u na4-sag-kal na4.esi na4.KA-gi-na ur-sag na4.null gar3-ra-du-um-bi uru ba-ab-lah4-lah4 In the land it (Asag) created offspring. Its seed grew widely. They gave each other a name. As their king, U2 raised the horns like a large aurochs in their midst. Su-u, Sag-kal, Diorite, KA-gi-na, and hero Null, their warriors, plundered the cities. 1. After this article had been written, D. Charpin kindly drew my attention to a find of blocks of emery in Ris Ibn HAni. The details of this find, which belongs to the Late Bronze Age, were reported by P. Bordreuil et al in CRAI (1984) 398-438. J.-M. Durand and D. Soubeyran suggested there that these blocks be identified with the gammu-stone, on the basis of the same textual evidence which I used also, namely that from Mari, "Lugal," and lexical sources. I have not altered the text of my article because my arguments proceed in a different way and thus complement and confirm Durand's and Soubeyran's conclusions. 2.

GWINNETT Ninurta, in accordance with his role as defender of the cities against "the land" (kur), took up his arms. The ensuing fight is described as a series of encounters with Asag alone; the stones are passed over in silence. That they did participate is expressed at the very end of the story. Some had fought against Ninurta and were cursed by him, others had not opposed him and were now blessed. The curses and blessings represent, as J. van Dijk puts it, "un trait6 herm6tique sur l'usage des pierres, sur la technique du lapicide, de l'orf vrerie, de la statuaire, du sculpteur."3 The hermetical nature of the treatise can, in many cases, be transformed into understandable terms by deanthropomorphizing the actors and their actions. The first stone whom Ninurta addressed, and cursed, was, as could be expected, the U2-stone, king of stones. The part of the curse that describes the future use of the stone reads as follows (lines 423-34): kala-ga wul e2-gar8 tuku diri-ga-me-en alan-zu be2-em-ta-ba pirig-gal usu-bi-ta nir-gal2-la-am3 be2-me-zi-ir-zi-ir-re-ne usu-tuku a-gars-re su be2-gid2-de3 gurus na4.U2 es-zu zi3-gin7 be2-me-dub-bu-ne li-li-a-zu -u ba-ba-ab-zi-ge-en ad6-ba zu2 e3-ni-ib gurus-me-en gu3-de2-zu be2-gal2 be2-si3-de3 be2-til-e am-gal lu2-sar2-re gaz-za-gin7 nig2-ba-bi gar-ra na4.U2 gii.tukul-ta ur-gi, me3-ta ni2g sipa-tur-re al-sar-re-gin7 en-me-en na4.gug me-ri-kul-la-za mu-bi be2-sa4 i3-ne-eg2 nam-tar-ra-d.Nin-urta-ka u4-da na4.U2 ub-tag na4.gug-buru3-da ur5 be2-na-nam-ma A powerful (person), a man possessing (the physique of) a wall, exceeding are you, (yet) your figure shall be diminished.

The name (of the fact) that carnelian is razed in contact with you shall be given. Now, by the decree of destiny of Ninurta: From this day on, when U2 has touched it (carnelian), alas, it (the name) shall be "carnelian piercing." The passage seems to contain three separate, but related, topics: (1) what happens to the U2-stone when it is put to use; (2) what happens to that on which it is used; and (3) what is its most outstanding ability. What happens to the U2-stone when it is used is that it is reduced from a state where it has a "figure" (alan) to a state where it can be heaped like flour. The verbs in lines 423f. seem to describe the process of reduction in two steps: ba (with the ablative) means "to diminish" something by dividing it into parts (ba) and would thus be a fitting description of the splitting and breaking up of a block of U2-stone; zi-ir is best known in the-obviously transferred-meaning "to annul" a written document. The Akkadian equivalent, pussusu, describes concretely the process observable in a lump of soil as it dissolves in water. Line 425 is not another variation on the theme "reduction," but rather refers to a circumstance of the reduction. As is confirmed by the texts from Mari, the U2-stone was used together with lead.4 The agents of the reduction of the U2-stone to the consistency of flour were, in the anthropomorphic stylization of the passage, its "brothers" and "offspring"; in deanthropomorphized terms, themselves stones. While they reduced the U2-stone, the latter was working on them or, as the text puts it, on their corpses. Two work processes are clearly expressed: cutting a block of stone into pieces (this is expressed in the simile of line 429) and polishing.5 It is not evident whether the "finishing" of line 428 was a process in its own right or rather a synonym for "polishing." 4. Van Dijk reads usu-tuku a-bar,-re 9u be2-gix-de3 and translates "l'athlbte, pour disputer le combat a deux, allongera la main (vers toi: pour te lancer comme discobole)." He bases the translation on one of two meanings of the Akkadian word aba-ru, namely "combat." The Sumerian equivalent of this work, lirum, was in fact chosen by text N3. The other texts have a-gars, one spells syllabically e2-gars, the Sumerian equivalent of the other meaning of Akkadian abaru, namely "lead." Van Dijk attempts to explain this by assuming a Sumerian word a-barx, which would be a loan from Akkadian abaru. The occurrence of lead together with gammu in Mari (discussed below) now invalidates this complicated scheme. 5. I read be2-si3-de3 instead of van Dijk's GAN.SUM-gim. The copy of text SI, where alone the phrase is preserved, allows -de3 for -gim. Thus we can posit a verbal form that is parallel with those flanking it. The verbal base si3 = sapanu is chosen because of the obvious parallel with sapanu in the Mari texts (see below).</page><page sequence="4">198 W. HlEIMPEL, L. GORELICK, A.J. GWINNETT The third topic refers to what must have been the most amazing feat of the U2-stone, namely its ability to pierce carnelian. Technically, piercing was surely more difficult than cutting and polishing; moreover, carnelian belonged among the hardest stones that were worked by Babylonian stoneworkers. The rather bombastic bestowal of the epithet "carnelian piercing" can be understood as a symptom of the appreciation of the properties of the U2-stone. 2. The evidence from Mari Among the administrative texts from Old Babylonian Mari the stone, there called by its Akkadian name gammu, is well attested in receipts that record specific quantities and applications of the stone. In two texts other materials that were used in conjunction with ?ammu are also listed. The crucial information is given in Chart 1.6 Three varieties of ?ammu were distinguished: "piercing gammu" (text 2), "Sutean gammu" (text 9), and unqualified "gammu" (all other texts). "Piercing gammu" was, at least in the case of text 2, not used for piercing but for polishing. Accordingly the term designates here a variety, presumably of high quality. "Sutean gammu" probably came from the land of the Suteans which was, in the texts from Mari, the Syrian steppe. The stone was measured in minas and shekels. The fact that it was measured at all, and in exact and round numbers at that, suggests that it was used in the form of sand rather than in blocks. The price of 60 minas was 5 shekels of silver,' which corresponded roughly to the price of a slave or an ox. The applications correspond exactly to those mentioned in "Lugal": piercing, cutting, and polishing. The only instance for piercing in the Mari texts refers to metal. Metalworkers seem to have used ?ammu routinely, as is implied in a text that records the issue of two pounds of ammu each for three tibira.8 Texts 10 and 11 demonstrate that ?ammu was used in conjunction with lead in equal quantities and with small quantities of copper. It is unfortunate that these texts do not also specify the kind of work; only text lid contains a clue for at least one kind of work that was performed with all three materials: the saws cannot have been the object of the work because in that case the mention of the four alabaster pegs would not make sense. The materials must have been used in conjunction with saws for making the pegs. A possible explanation provided by Pliny is discussed below. 6. A summary of the evidence from Mari is given by D. Soubeyran in ARM 23 448f. 7. ARM 21 221. 8. ARM 23 527.</page><page sequence="5">EVIDENCE FOR THE USE OF EMERY 199 3. Identification The stone U2, respectively gammu, was used to cut, polish, and pierce stone, and to pierce metal.Among the stones on which it was used were carnelian, a chalcedony, and dublu (Mari, text 10), presumably another chalcedony or a crystalline quartz. These stones can be worked with quartz sand but, since the latter is not harder than other varieties of quartz including chalcedonies, work is slow and tedious. The ancient craftsman must have wished for a harder stone and valued it highly when he found it. There are reasons to believe that ?ammu was not quartz but such a coveted harder stone. ?ammu was not, at least not in Mesopotamia,9 used as a gemstone. Hence it could not have been rockcrystal, amethyst, rose quartz and other crystalline quartzes, or one or other of the much used chalcedonies, such as carnelian, agate, or jasper. If it was a form of quartz which was not appealing as a gemstone, such as quartzite pebbles or quartz sand, we would expect it to be mentioned as raw material for the manufacture of glass. The latter has been identified as immanakku.'0 If ?ammu was not a quartz, it must have been a harder stone, a conclusion that is confirmed by the role the stone plays in the myth "Lugal." There it was the king of stones and thus represented the ultimate in some quality. That quality was not beauty, because the stone was not used as a gemstone. It may well have been hardness. Stones that are harder than quartz are mostly gemstones, the true precious stones such as emerald, sapphire, and diamond. There is one exception: emery, a form of corundum. The word emery and its cognates in European languages (such as Schmirgel, esmeril) derive from Greek smiris, which is further connected with Hebrew gamirr and Egyptian ?smr." Smiris was a form of corundum that the Greeks and Romans used for cutting and polishing stone. Its main occurrence was on the island of Naxos, but there were some minor occurrences, and it was also imported from Egypt and India. Indian emery sand was highly valued.'2 Its use was clearly described by Pliny: "Whoever 9. In the inventories of necklaces from Qatna, beads made of gammu are often mentioned. I assume that gammu in Qatna is different from gammu in Mesopotamia. 10. R. H. Brill in A. L. Oppenheim, Glass and Glassmaking in Ancient Mesopotamia, pp. 109f. 11. R. Campbell Thompson (in Campbell Thompson DAC) tried to connect this with na4.AS.MUR. The latter is now read as.bar. He further suggested the identification of emery with a whole series of stone names. None of these have been, or can now be, confirmed. 12. For Indian emery as part of Rome's oriental trade, see E. H. Warmington, The Commerce Between the Roman Empire and India (1974) p. 247.</page><page sequence="6">200 W. HEIMPEL, L. GORELICK, A.J. GWINNETT first discovered how to cut marble and carve up luxury into many portions was a man of misplaced ingenuity. The cutting of marble is effected apparently by iron, but actually by sand, for the saw merely presses the sand upon a very thinly traced line, and then the passage of the instrument, owing to the rapid movement to and fro, is in itself enough to cut the stone. The Ethiopian variety of this sand is the most highly esteemed.. . . The Indian is the next most highly praised, but the Ethiopian is finer and cuts without leaving any roughness. The Indian does not give the stone such a smooth surface. However, people engaged in polishing marble are strongly recommended to rub marble with it when it has been calcined. There is a similar fault in the Naxian sand and in that of Coptos, which is known as the Egyptian variety. These were the kinds used for cutting marble in early times."'3 The passage contains striking connections with the information contained in the myth "Lugal" and in the Mari texts: The stone was used in the form of sand. It was used for cutting and polishing marble (in Pliny's terminology), or alabaster (in the terminology of Assyriological translations of aInugallum). The cutting was done by moving a saw along a groove that was filled with emery sand. Pliny does not mention the use of lead in conjunction with emery. I presume that the lead was used in lumps or blocks and that the soft metal served to hold the grains of emery in place. Against this background the phrase in "Lugal" that the lead "seized" the U2-stone becomes understandable. The combina- tion with lead could thus have been a functional forerunner of emery paper. The high specific weight of lead should also have helped to keep it and with it the abrasive grains of emery in close contact with the surface that was being worked. Whether the man of misplaced ingenuity was a Babylonian remains to be seen. Likely he was not. There exists no known occurrence of emery sand close to Babylonia. The question is rather whether the Babylonians learned about the stone and its use from India, whence they imported pierced carnelian beads'4 and where high grade emery sand was found, or from Greece or Egypt through Syria or Anatolia. 13. Natural History xxxvi 51f., cited in the translation of D. E. Eichholz in the Loeb Classical Library. 14. In the Ur III period, for which alone we possess information about the import of carnelian, the stone was typically imported in the form of beads and not as raw material; cf.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE In a recent study' we documented that the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr period Mesopotamian cylinder seals were predominantly made from soft stones such as steatite, marble, and limestone, all in the Mohs hardness scale of 1-3. However, by the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian periods, hard stones in the Mohs range of 5-6, such as hematite, were commonly used (Fig. 1). One reason for this change is the use of copper and/or bronze tools to work the stone, replacing the earlier chipped flint microdrills and engravers. The purpose of this paper is to present archaeological evidence for another major factor in the change: the emergence of emery rather than obsidian and/or quartz as the abrasive of preference of the lapidary. Emery is a rock combining two minerals, corundum (A1203) and magnetite (FeO Fe203). In its gem form, the mineral corundum is known as ruby or sapphire.

As can be seen from the graph (Fig. 2), corundum is a very hard natural abrasive, ranking next to diamond (Mohs 10). In grit form it is the most efficient commonly used natural abrasive short of diamond grit itself. Until the modern development of silicon carbide abrasive (Mohs 9.5), it was the abrasive of choice for most lapidaries. Modern, so-called "emery"-boards for smoothing and polishing are general silicon carbide.

HEIMPEL, L. GORELICK, A.J. GWINNETT The one known ancient source of emery, Naxos, was called "Naxium" by Pliny. A modern Near Eastern source of emery is located near Izmir, Turkey, but there is no proof that it was known and/or used in ancient times. The oldest context in which emery has been excavated or in which its use has been suggested is in the Cyclades in the Neolithic period, before the end of the fourth millennium B.C.2 Woolley stated that he had found emery at Ur at the level of the pre-Sargonid period,3 but did not elaborate further on the context of his find or on its significance. Frankfort suggested that emery was used for the manufacture of hard stone cylinder seals, but gave neither his reasons nor evidence to support his statement.4 The question of whether emery or quartz sand was used by the ancient Egyptians to produce certain drilled granite artifacts of the 4th Dynasty (c. 2500 B.C.), was debated by Petrie5 and more recently by Lucas.6 Emery was found at Mallia, Crete, by Von Effenterre,7 in a context dated to the MM Ib period (c. 1800 B.C.), thus somewhat later than the time of Woolley's discovery. Warrens reported the presence of emery powder adhering to bore cores from Knossos that stemmed from stone vase manufacture. These were dated to LM IB - II/IIIA. He noted that emery was also found on cores of soft stones such as serpentine, and was thus not reserved only for use on the hardest materials. Bordreuil discovered lumps of emery at Ras Ibn Hani in Syria.9 Using functional analysis and scanning electron microscopy, we1' recent- ly demonstrated that emery used in the form of a loose abrasive, was used by the ancient Egyptians to produce the granite objects of the 4th Dynasty mentioned earlier, rather than quartz sand. The drilled artifacts had a series of regular concentric lines. These could be reproduced with emery, 2. M. G. Oosterom, "Mineral Investigation of Archeological Specimens from Saliagos," in J. D.

Quartz sand could drill, but it did not produce the tell-tale abrasion grooves. Emery, as a harder abrasive, was both faster and produces the grooves. The drill we used in the experiment was a copper tube, since the cores discussed by Petrie and Lucas were also drilled with a tubular drill.

The evidence provided by the ancient artifacts, combined with the findings of modern experimental analysis thus documents the use of emery as a loose abrasive on a variety of materials. This need not have been the only technique by which emery was used by the ancients. In the "Lugal" myth emery is described as being "seized" by lead. This is a graphic way of describing emery, in an abrasive form, embedded in a sheet of lead. In effect, this combination could have been a precursor of the modem emery- board. In order to determine if emery could indeed be readily and simply embedded in lead, and thus function as a modern emery-board, a sheet of lead was sprinkled with emery abrasive of 35-60 grit, which was then forced into the lead with a hammer (Fig. 8). The emery remained embedded in the lead and functioned satisfactorily without loosening. The overall evidence strongly suggests that by 2000 B.C. the value of emery had been established by the lapidaries. It is our impression that emery was to the ancient lapidary what tin was to Bronze Age metallurgy. When and where its use began requires further research.</page></plain_text>
