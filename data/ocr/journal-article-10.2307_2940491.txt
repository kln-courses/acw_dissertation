E. G. SPAULDING. New York: Henry Holt and Company. 1918. Pp. xviii + 532. Professor Spaulding has given us in the preface and brief intro- duction to The New Rationalism so admirable a review of the con- tents and essential doctrines of his book, that I find it difficult not to quote them in full and then to ask the editor of the JOURNAL to accept the quotation as my review of the book. However, I shall avoid this breach of custom by not looking at the book again until I have written out what I find to be the fundamental standpoints taken by the author. I should add that I have had, since studying the book, the help given by two hours of conversation with the author regarding these standpoints, and that I feel it my chief duty as a reviewer of the book to prevent certain possible misunderstandings of the author's position. In studying doctrines that are dressed so completely, as are those of this book, in the garb of logic and rationalism the reader is liable to be reminded of Descartes and Spinoza when he should be reminded rather of Plato. I might put it, Spaulding's position is to tliat of modern thought as Plato's realism is to the thought of Greece in the fourth century before Christ. Yet Spaulding is and is not a Platonic realist. He is not altogether a Platonist, for the simple reason that he is a modern and Plato of course was not. That is to say, at the bottom Spaulding is an experimentalist. He and even the pragmatist can find a common platform, or at least a few planks, on which to stand and grasp hands. He admits that man is indeed engaged in a trial and error process. lie claims no infallibility for man's intellect, though he does believe thbat we discover facts through the intellect. Man's world is subjective, subjective in the sense that it is a selected world, a world, if you will, selected by the nature of man. Over against this Spaulding is not the less a Platonic realist; for there is a world of eternal verities, a world not made by man but little by little discovered by man. In short, the trial and error process called the history of science and of thought is not a process of manufacture or creation but one of discovery. Perhaps nothing brings out so emphatically and explicitly this realism as does Spaulding's doctrine of values, or ideals. Many a realist would admit the eternal verity and non-anthropomorphic char- acter of mathematics, but would not admit that esthetics, ethics, and religion are logically quite prior to or independent of human nature.</page><page sequence="2">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 219 Man's conscience and esthetic taste are no doubt a human selection and in that sense man's art and morals are human; but the good and the beautiful are such not one whit the less independently of man than is the true. In short, as man's nature is not one of the fundamental postulates of geometry, so also is man's nature in no way a funda- mental postulate of ethics, religion, and esthetics. The good, the true, and the beautiful form a Platonic world of eternal being not added to or substracted from respectively by man's appearance or disappear- ance in the drama of world-history. Therefore they can be and should be studied quite apart from history and psychology. And as a matter of fact they are frequently so studied. May I add, the book was written in the years' of the war and the author clearly felt that one of the most dangerous heresies 'of modern civilization is moral and religious subjectivism. If man is to regard himself as 'the measure of all things, or to adopt natural selection as the only ultimate criterion, our civilization faces inevitable decadence in the near future. The greater our command over nature through tools, the greater our capital, or command over human labor, and the greater our field of operation, the quicker must come the cataclysm when wayward, wilful, and skeptical mankind bring about another Noah's flood. You may think to reach heaven by a moral tower of Babel built as you will or as your biological architects advise; but you will not reach heaven in that way. Heaven and God are all about you, not to be seen perhaps with your bodily eyes but to be discovered with the eyes of the intellect as you have discovered the eternal verities of mathematics. Spaulding believes it to be the supreme duty of the modern philosopher to combat our subjectivism or humanism, as Plato believed it his supreme duty to combat the men he called Sophists. Suich is Spaulding's realism. The next thing to be done, if we are to understand this book, is to recognize the place of logic in the author's philosophy. Here we quite misunderstand him if we infer that he undervalues facts and verification through experimental enquiry. MAere logic can not verify the conclusions of our arguments; for this can be done only by crucial experiments. Yet logic is to be given a highly important place in man's intellectual enterprise. Logic itself deals with facts as truly as does chemistry; and logic is one of the most powerful intellectual tools or instruments man has discovered. Whether or not we think that logic can be avoided, historically the student has not succeeded in avoiding it. Logic is there; and whether we like it or not, we have to play the logical game. This game and its rules may seem arbitrary; and such is the case in the sense that logic itself is ultimately an experimental enquiry or procedure as truly as is</page><page sequence="3">220 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY any other science. None the less if we play the game, that is, if we adopt any given logic, we must abide by the rules of the particular game we adopt. This last statement introduces us to two of the bases of Spaul- ding's criticism of modern and current philosophical system. First, what logic are we to adopt; and secondly, the game once chosen, do we obey the rules? He finds that modern philosophers are playing the game of Aristotelian logic; whereas the most advanced or the most exact sciences have a new game of logic. The Aristotelian logic assumes a world of substantial things and their attributes, of inter- acting things causally related, and in general of things related by similarity and difference. In short, it is a logic of subject-predicate propositions and a logic of classes related by exclusion or inclusion. In contrast, the logic of the exact sciences is a logic of relations. It is a logic of symmetrical, asymmetrical, transitive, and intransitive relations, of types of order, of series, and the like. Its terms are variables and these variables are functionally related. In deciding between these two logics Spaulding is thoroughly an empiricist. As a matter of fact modern science by its logic has suc- ceeded in solving problems the Aristotelian logic has not succeeded in solving. As a matter of fact modern science finds its relational logic not only usable but in agreement with the results of experi- mental enquiry. Whereas the Aristotelian logic is found to be inade- quate. In the judgment of modern science we do not live in a world of things and substances, of attributes of substances, and of causal interrelationships. Rather we seem to live in a world whose rela- tions can be external to the entities related, a world variously ordered, a world containing series, variables and functional relation- ships. Accordingly Spaulding condemns the modern philosopher for continuing to play the wrong game. This philosopher is assum- ing a world that modern science fails to find, really a world of the ignorant and of our pre-scientific ancestors, 'a world of things and their qualities. As a consequence the modern philosopher has hopelessly divorced himself from the remainder of the modern intellectual class. He is trying even to solve problems raised regarding science by tools that have been already found inadequate within science. No wonder that modern philosophy as a whole has reached an impasse land that the solutions offered by the several systems form a series of paradoxes and even absurdities. Thus our author examines phenomenalism, subjective idealism, positivism, and pragmatism and finds them to be causation philosophies; again he examines objective idealism and points out that it is a substance philosophy. That is to say, these philosophies are trying to solve problems by means of respectively a</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 221 causation and a substance logic, pro'blems that permit no such solu- tion. In contrast, the author maintains that realism is at bottom an effort to adopt the new logic of science and that this philosophy shows promise of succeeding in solving the persistent problems of the tra- ditional schools, in avoiding the old paradoxes, and in bringing back philosophy once more into partnership with science. But even if we pass by the question: Which logic ? the traditional philosophies should at least play the game of the old logic by obeying its rules. Here the book introduces the criterion of self-criticism which the author made use of and defended in articles published a decade and more ago. If a system claims to, be logically consistent, it should stand the test of self-criticism. It should not tacitly as- sume as an initial postulate what it denies in its conclusion. For example, absolute skepticism should not assume the possibility of knowing in order to show that all knowledge is impossible. Phe- nomnenalism should not assume a knowledge of "the world of things- in-themselves" in order to prove that this world transcends our possible knowledge. The final one hundred and fifty pages of the book are given to a critical and constructive formulation of the basic standpoints of real- ism. Here too I would emphasize the underlying spirit rather than the detailed results. Realism is loyally empirical. It is pluralistic because the facts ultimately faced by science force pluralism upon us. If I mistake not, Spaulding is deeply impressed by the logical independence found among the fundamental terms and postulates of the sciences. The world is populated by many terms and relations, or entities which simply are there together. It is impossible to de- duce them from one another. There is no reason why any one of them should not be absent and the others not remain as they are. They are like the dimensions of space. Why are there three dimen- sions and not four? The question has no answer except, "We find but three." This same independence within reality and the resulting em- piricism forced upon the philosopher are to be seen in the successive strata we meet in going from the simple to the complex, from the lower to the higher existences. The world might have had only the chemical elements, but we find the chemical compounds. It might have had only the lifeless, but we find the living. It might have had only individual men, but we find societies. They simply are. From the lower we can not deduce the higher, though we may find correlations and one to one correspondences between the strata. Again, this logical independence makes evolution and history a real process. It is a process of creative synthesis in which the gen- uinely and irreducibly new comes into existence.</page><page sequence="5">222 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Finally this logical independence is the true basis for a doctrine of freedom. The higher stratum is independent of the lower. It has its own realn of law and though not free in the sense of being lawless is free in the sense of self-government. Life is governed not by the rules of chemistry but by those of life. Mind is governed by the laws of mind, the reason by those of the reason. The higher and the lower are indeed consistent, but this in no way prevents their being indepenldent. Man has a biological and -a physical organiza- tion; but he is also an ethical 'and a reasoning being. His ethical and rational nature do not conflict with his biological and physical characteristics. "The particular ethical and rational characteristics presuppose the particular biological, physical, and chemical char- acteristics enlbodied in any one human individual, but they can not be derived fromn or identified with these latter, though, once dis- covered, they can in some way be correlated with them. But from this there follows the conclusion-of the gravest importance for the world in the present world-conflict of standards-that ethics is not a branch of biology, even as biology is not a branch of chemistry and physics, and al'so that conscience, will, and reason, although not undetermined and lawless, are nevertheless free." They are not free in the sense of belonging to a realm from which causation is absent, but are free in the sense that they belong to a realm in which "the ideals of right and justice and truth are present as efficiencies," capable of leading "men to act as they ought to act, and to reason as the implicative structure of reality dictates, and not as tradition and custon and authority would have them reason."
