CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.-Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending direct to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Worcester, Massa- chusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] Ahlenius (K.) Kaffe, te och r6rsocker, de- ras ursprungliga hem och viktigaste pro- duktionsomraden. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1903, xxIII, 243-268, 2 maps.) Treats of the original homes of coffee, tea, and cane-sugar, and their principal centers of production. Arabia was probably the place where coffee was first cultivated, Africa possibly the home of the coffee- tree. The original home of tea may have been in Assam or southwestern China. The sugar-cane was native to some part of northeastern Hindustan or Assam, as Ritter thought. Anutchin (D. N.) O zadachach' i meto- dach' antropologil. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1902, III, No. I, 62- 88; 13 figs. ) General discussion of the problems and methods of anthropology, with reference to the question of the vari- ability of races, the r81e of sociological- anthropological factors, etc. (Ranke, Ripley, Broca, Livi, etc., are drawn upon for maps. ) Baum (Hr) und Kirsten (Hr) Ver- gleichend-anatomische Untersuchungen iiber die Ohrmuskulatur verschiedener Siugetiere. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1903, xxIv, 33-74, 14 figs.) Treats of ear- musculature of horse, cow, sheep, goat, deer, swine, rabbit, etc., with bibliog- raphy. The muscles of the human ear correspond not to individual muscles of the animal ear, but to groups of these. The high degree of reduction carries with it the abolition of the ability to move the ear. Beddoe (J.) De l'6valuation et de la sig- nification de la capacit6 cranienne. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1903, XIv, 267-294, 9 tables.) After discussing the data of Barnard Davis, Flower, Broca and Topinard, Pearson and Lee, Manouvrier, Fawcett, etc., Dr Beddoe gives the re- sults of his special study of 526 heads (estimation of capacity from circumfer- ence) of living individuals, chiefly from various parts of the British Isles, of whom at least 6o are men of "superior intellectuality." The conclusion reached is that "an evident correlation exists be- tween head volume and intellectual power. " Colareau (E.) Le problame scientifique d'une langue artificielle. Fondements et progr~s de l'Esperanto. (Rev. g6n. d. Sciences, Paris, 1903, xIv, 947-958.) Gives general account of the nature and progress of "Esperanto," put forward by Dr Zamenhoff as an international language. The Esperantist literature comprises more than 150 works, includ- ing a translation of Hamlet by the father of this Latinophile speech. Coupin (H.) Les fun6railles singulibres, (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1903, 4e s., xx, 621-628.) Treats of funeral rites and customs among the Bagas-Foreth of French Guinea, the Australians, New Caledonians, New Hebrideans, Malac- can negritos, Mincopis, Congo negroes, Zambezan Banyai, Makwas, Kaffi: s, Khevsurs of the Caucasus, Ostiaks, Hindus, Todas, Ainus of Japan, Cam- bodians, Tibetans, Samoyeds, Kalmucks, Giliaks, Mongols, Sakalavas and Hovas of Madagascar, etc. Feindel (E.) Le gigantismechez l'homme. (Rev. g6n. d. Sciences, Paris, 1903, xIv, 209-216, 7 figs.) General discus- 162</page><page sequence="3">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 163 sion of giantism based on Brissaud and Meige. Two chief types are recognized, the infantile and the acromegalic with numerous intermediary varieties. The coexistence of infantilism and giantism is not rare. Giantism is acromegaly of the period of growth proper; acromegaly is giantism of the period of completed growth. Macrosomia may occur at any age and giantism may be quite transitory ; the latter is often the case with adoles- cents. Flashman (F. F.) External features of the brain of a microcephalic idiot show- ing absence of corpus callosum. (Rep. Pathol. Lab. Lun. Dept. N. S. W. Gov., Sydney, 1903, I, I-I8, Io pl.) Detailed description of brain (wt. 554.25 gr. ) of male idiot aged I7 years, died of diph- theria. Friedrich (Dr) Einige kartographische Aufgaben in der Wirtschaftsgeographie. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 69- 72, 85-87.) Author outlines for accom- paniment of distribution-map his four economic stages : Animal, instinct, tradi- tion, science, which correspond to the four "culture-stages of Vierkandt. The use of maps is emphasized. He holds that a true picture of the internal condi- tion of man is given by the outward expression in economy of the process of growing freedom from the restraint of nature. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) Considerazioni antropologiche sull infantilismo e con- clusioni relative all'origine delle variet. umane. (Monit. Zool., Firenze, 1903, XIV, repr. pp. 21.) Discusses the anthro- pological characters of "' infantilism," the so-called "infantilism" of woman, and the origin of human varieties, with references to recent studies of Manouv- rier, Godin, Papillault, etc. The author agrees with Manouvrier and Topinard in attributing the " female deficit" (e. g. in brain-weight) to the less active life of woman. Woman is, somatically, less primitive and conservative and more variable than man and her so-called "infantilism " is a chimera. The fixa- tion of somatic characters in the higher races is of recent origin and in spite of invariability of cranial form, they are relatively young, having been really species in process of formation. Sulla plasticit&amp; delle varilt&amp; umane. (Ibid., 158-167.) Holds that a certain plasticity (shown in the proportion of dif- ferent skull-types, etc.) exists in the Eurasian and Mediterranean varieties of mankind. Argues against the theory of Boas (followed by Fishberg) that no new type can arise through mingling of two different types. - La maggiore variabilita della donna dimostrata col metodo Camerano, coeffi- ciente somatico. (Ibid., 294-304.) From the examination by the method of the " somatic coefficient " of 55 male and 55 female bodies of Bolognese, the author finds that the variability of the latter is much greater as to lower limbs, con- siderably greater as to width of shoul- ders, and somewhat greater as to upper limbs. By reason of her greater varia- bility woman has an advantageous re- serve of plasticity, which is lacking to man. The morphologic superiority of woman, if it exists, removes her even more from the infantile condition than is man. The "superiority" of infantilism rests on an equivoque. - Crani e mandiboli di Sumatra. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1903, IX, repr. 64 pp., 5 figs.) Describes in de- tail, with tables of measurements, etc., lo male and 4 female crania and man- dibles from Sumatra, now in the Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography, Rome. They represent a mixed race with abun- dant Malayoid elements. The skele- ton of the face exhibits also " Indone- sian" features. Hindu and Chinese traces are also, perhaps, discernible. In these skulls the bones of the face are very important. Robustness of the masticatory apparatus and volume of mandible are in evidence, signs of mor- phologic inferiority. The capacity of the female crania ranges 1095-1405 and of the male 1235-1635 cm., the cephalic indices 80-90.2 and 71.5-92.9 respec- tively. - La posizione del bregma nel cranio del "Pithecanthropus erectus" e la tendenza neo-monogenista in Germania. (Ibid., 1904, x, repr. 21 pp.) Discusses the arguments of Schwalbe, Macnamara, and Manouvrier as to the position of breg- ma in the cranium of the Pithecanthro- pus erectus, accepting the opinion of the last. The neo-monogenistic view is re- presented by Klaatsch, Schcetensack, Alsberg, etc., who favor "an autono- mous precocious evolution of the human</page><page sequence="4">164 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 6, I904 stock, eliminating the anthropoids from the series of our ascendants." On the other side is Manouvrier who upholds the earlier theory of the anthropoid ori- gin of man. In Germany polygenism can hardly make proselytes. Giuffrida- Ruggeri has elsewhere discussed the Pithecanthropus and the gibbon as prob- able ancestors of man. Goerth (A.) Das sittliche Gefiihl beim minnlichen und beim weiblichen Ge- schlecht. (Die Deutsche Schule, Leip- zig, 1903, vII, 166-174.) General discussion. Concludes that women are not "political animals" like men, and consequently should not be placed above the latter in office. Hall (G. S. ) The relations between lower and higher races. Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc., Boston, 1903, 2 s., xvII, 4-13.) Treats of extermination, contamination by the touch of civilization, effects of dis- ease, colonization, etc. Appeals for the preservation of the lower races as need- ful for the complete development of the higher - " an ounce of heredity is worth a hundred-weight of civilization and schooling." James (W.) A case of automatic draw- ing. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1904, LxIv, I95-201, figs.) Brief account of development of automatic drawing in a man of fifty, accelerated by hypnotic ex- hibition. Joteyko (J.) A propos des femmes math- 6maticiens. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1904, 5e s, I, 12-15.) Critique of an article by Loria in a previous number. Mlle Joteyko points out that women can do and have done good work in science, both in their own right, as well as masked behind husbands or brothers. Lissauer (A.) Bericht der vorbereitenden Commission zur Herstellung von Typen- karten. (Corr. Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, XXXIV, 123- 125.) Reports organization and briefly discusses objects of committee (ap- pointed at the Dortmund meeting) on the making of maps of types of prehistoric objects, etc. Lockyer (N.) The influence of brain- power on history. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1903, LXIV, 71-86.) From Ad- dress of President, British Association, Southport meeting, 1903. Loisel (G.) Les correlations des carac- thres sexuels secondaires. (R. de 1' c. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, 325-340.) General discussion. Author holds that secondary sexual characters appear or are exaggerated at the moment of sexual im- pulse; decrease or disappear when the genital glands are no longer in sexual ac- tivity; are modified when the genital glands are diseased; decrease generally or disappear completely after direct cas- tration. The formation of secondary sex- ual characters may also be influenced by causes (diseases, traumatisms) having nothing, apparently, to do with the ac- tivity of the sexual glands. Lonborg (S.) Historisk geografi. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1903, xxIII, 298-310o.) Dis- cusses the nature and province of his- torical geography, its problems, etc. Loria (G.) Les femmes math6maticiennes. (Rev. Scient., Paris, 1903, 4e s., xx, 385-392.) Historical sketch. Author agrees with M6bius that mathematics lie " outside the nature of woman." Still, obstacles are not to be placed in her way. Manouvrier (L.) Les marques sincipi- tales des cranes nbolithiques consid6r6es comme reliant la chirurgie classique anci- enne la chirurgie pr6historique. (R. de l'Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, 431-436, 4 figs.) Author argues that the "sincipital marks" on neolithic skulls are due to surgical operations performed for the same purpose by the physicians of ancient classic times - cau- terizations or scarifications for affections of the head. - Conclusions g6n6rales sur l'anthro- pologie des sexes et applications sociales. (Ibid., 405-423.) General discussion. The masculine supremacy of today has deeper roots than man's opinion of the intelligence of woman, but an eternal and fixed social subordination of the one sex is not implied in this. Feminism is an aspect of socialism, from which it is separable neither theoretically nor prac- tically. Evolutional adaptation of the sexes must produce the lasting social re- form. Martin (R.) Ueber einige neuere Instru- mente und Hilfsmittel fdir den anthro- pologischen Unterricht. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen 1903, xxxIv, 127-132, 9 figs.) Brief descriptions of useful new and improved</page><page sequence="5">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE I65 anthropometer, callipers, instrument-box, goniometer, parallelograph, dioptograph, craniophore, etc. Also a series of glass eyes to serve as color-table. A color- table for the skin is in preparation. Minakov (P. A.) Znachenie antropologil v' meditzin. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1902, III, No. I, 89-IOr.) General discussion of value of anthro- pology to medicine - race-pathology, nervous diseases, suicide, significance of anatomical characteristics for identifica- tion of criminals, etc., Bertillon system. Modena (G.) L'acromegalia. (R. Sper. di Fren., Reggio, 1903, xxIx, 629-640o. ) First part of critical r6sum6 of literature. Acromegaly occurs oftener in women, is most common at the age of 20-40 years in both sexes, few cases occur before 20. Muiller (H.) Essais de taille du silex. Montage et emploi des outils obtenus. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, I903, XIV, 417-436, 8 figs.) Gives the results of interesting experiments (subsidied by the French Association for the Advancement of Science) in the production and use of flint hatchets - wood and bone working, trepanning, etc. - after the fashion of primitive man. In I I hours and45 minutes the author produced a polished axe; in an hour and 13 minutes (2,2oo blows) cut down an oak 0o.73 meters in circum- ference. M. Miiller seems unaware of the previous experiments of J. D. Mc- Guire and the late F. H. Cushing along similar lines. Patrick (G. T. W.) The psychology of foot-ball. (Amer. J. of Psych., Wor- cester, 1903, XIV, 104-117.) Treats, among other things, of the anthropolog- ical and "recapitulatory" aspects of such games as foot-ball. The author does not see therein a "return to sav- agery." The game acts, for both players and spectators, as "a sort of Aristotelian catharsis. ' Pearl (R.) On the mortality due to con- genital malformations, with especial ref- erence to the problem of the relative variability of the sexes. (Medicine, De- troit, 1903, Ix, repr. 15 pp.) From consideration of the data as to malforma- tion-mortality in the United States in 1899-I9oo, given in the reports of the Twelfth Census, the author concludes " in intensity or degree of the malforma- tions woman is more variable than man." The sex more subject to the abnormalities is less variable with regard to them. These mortality data exemplify the action of natural selection upon man "by the elimination of unfavorable variations." Poncet (A.) et Leriche (R.) Nains d'au- jour d'hui et nains d'autrefois. (Rev. Scient., Paris, 1903, 4e s., xx, 587- 593.) Treats, with 2 figures, of modem and ancient dwarfs. Gives data con- cerning two dwarfs (brother and sister) from a village on the river Ain - cases of achondroplasia, true examples of which are becoming more and more rare. Dwarfs of today, of the ethnic sort met with in Germany, Switzerland, France, etc., are, like the ancient pygmies, not examples of pathological, but of ata- vistic achondroplasia. Ranke (J.) Die im Studienjahr 1902-3 an den UniversitYten Deutschlands, Oes- terreichs und der Schweiz abgehaltenen Vorlesungen und Curse aus dem Ge- sammtgebiete der Anthropologie: Soma- tische Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte zusammengestellt nach As- cherson's Universitats kalender. (Corr.- B1. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIv, 53-58.) These statistics of lectures and courses in anthropology in the universities of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, show that Berlin, Zii- rich, and Miinchen offer the most courses. Special courses relating to American anthropology appear at Berlin, Leipzig, Tiibingen, Bern. - Wissenschaftlicher Jahresbericht des GeneralsecretArs. (Ibid., I I6-123.) Contains critical r6sum6s of Heger's Alte Metalltrommeln aus Sildost-Asien (Leipzig, 1902), Retzius' Crania Sue- cica antiqua (Stockholm, I900oo), Retzius and Fiirst's Anthropologia Suecica (Stockholm, 900oo), von Luschan et al. Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli (Berlin, 1893-1902), etc. Reinach (S.) L'art et la magie a pro- pos des peintures et des gravures de 1' Age du renne. (L' Anthropologie, Paris, 1903, xIv, 257-266.) Compares man of the reindeer age, in the matter of "homeopathic magic," with the Aus- tralians (Spencer and Gillen). While not excluding imitation, ornament, the social uses of expression and communi- cation, etc., as factors in the develop- ment of art, Reinach holds that the art</page><page sequence="6">I66 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 of the primitive hunters and fishers of France and Spain owes its great exten- sion to "Imagic," the idea being that the possessor of an image of an object or a living being could thereby influence it. Ridgeway (Prof) The origin of the thoroughbred horse. (Proc. Cambr., Philos. Soc., 1903, xII, 14I-I43.) The blood-horse of today does not go back to the small horse of Europe from which came the cart horse, nor is its home in Arabia, where, before the Christian era, horse-breeding was not common. Pro- fessor Ridgeway suggests that "the Barbary horse, from which all the fine horses of the world have sprung, was derived either from the zebra of north- east Africa, or, as is more likely, from some very closely allied species now ex- tinct." Zebra markings occur on Arab foals at birth. Schaefer (F.) Einzelentwicklung und Gesamtentwicklung. ( Die Deutsche Schule, Leipzig, 1903, VII, 156-165, 226-237.) Treats of individual and mass-development from the standpoint of philosophy, biology, pedagogy, etc., also the Ziller " Kulturstufen." The author is an individualist and notes that advance in culture and intellectual devel- opment do not mean always the same thing. Scheppegrell (W.) Voice, song and speech. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1904, LXIV, 261-273, IO figs.) General dis- cussion of organs of speech in health and disease. Seger (Hr) Der Schutz der vorge- schichtlichen Denkmaler. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIV, 125-126.) Argues for a committee to consider questions relating to the protection of archeological monu- ments. Committee of society appointed. Siebs (T.) Zur vergleichenden Betrach- tung volkstiimlichen Brauches : Der Kuss. (Mitt. d. Schles. Ges. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1903, 1-19.) Interesting study of the kiss in folk-thought, symbolism, etc. The words for kiss and kissing in various European languages (Teu- tonic, Slavonic, Latin, Greek, Romance) are investigated and eight groups of kiss- words distinguished, the most common terms being those named after the mouth or the lip. The kiss of love, friendship, relationship, reconciliation, peace, grace, reverence, ceremony, etc., is considered. Singer (H.) Tharschisch und Ophir. (Globus, Bruschwg., 19o3, LXXXIV, 245-248. ) Rsum6 and criticism of the article of Oppert (see Amer. Anthr., 1903, N. S., V, 708). Singer considers that Ophir was not a fixed place, but " an Eldorado, like Peru or Australia," and agrees with the location of Tarshish in southern Spain. Vaschide (A.) Recherches experimen- tales sur l'olfaction des vieillards. (C.- R. Acad. d. Sci., Paris, 1903, cxxxvII, 627-628.) In sensation and (less) in perception, woman is superior to man in old age with respect to smell. Anosmia increases with age in both sexes. Walkhoff (0.) Die menschliche Sprache in ihrer Bedeutung fiir die funktionelle Gestalt des Unterkiefers. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1903, xxIv, 129-139.) Discusses views of Fischer and Roux. Concludes that the speech-function and not the masticatory produced the trajectorium. Wilser (L.) Die Namen der Menschen- rassen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIv, 303-307.) Discusses the vari- ous race names in use from the time of Linnaeus down - Blumenbach, Retzius, Cuvier, Top inard, Lapouge - for the peoples of Europe. Wilser expresses- himself against language as a race dis- tinction. He recognizes Linnaeus' Homo Europfeus (North European), Homo afer (better Homo niger), Homo asiaticus (better Homo brachycephalus), Homo alpinus, and besides these Homo medi- terraneus (including the Homo priscus or H. spel&amp;us, and also, as dwarf variety H. nanus) and Homo primigenius (Ne- anderthal, etc.). According to Wilser Europe was earliest occupied by dolicho- cephalic races. Wibling (C.) Ett samlingsfynd fron sten- Alderni Helsingborg. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1903, xxIII, 314-318, 3 figs.) Brief account of the finds of the stone age (five flint "saws") in a sand deposit at Helsingborg. Zaborowski (M.) Association franqaise pour l'avancement des Sciences. Congrls d'Angers (Aotft, 1903). Compte rendu de la section d' Anthropologie. (R. de P' Ec. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, 341-363.) Gives brief r6sum6s of papers read at the Anthropological section of the French Association. Archeology still engages the attention of most of those contributing to the program.</page><page sequence="7">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 167 EUROPE Andrae (H.) Hausinschriften aus Daln- mark. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 53-56.) Contains numerous house inscriptions from all over Den- mark, in Latin, Danish, High German, and Low German (a few) ; also house- marks. Andree (R.) Die Becherurnen. (Ibid., 129-130, 6 figs.) Brief account of the so-called "beaker" urns, based on the article of Abercromby. See American Anthropologist, 1903, N. s., v, 560. Ashley (W. J.) Early Teutonic society. (Int. Quart., Burlgtn., Vt., 1903-4, VIII, 236-261.) Discusses works of Stubbs, Waitz, Maine, von Maurer, Fustel de Coulanges, Denman Ross, Seebohm, Meitzen, Hildebrand, Wittich, Earle, Maitland, Baden-Powell, etc. Professor Ashley concludes that " the mark theory in its attractively idyllic form has gone; the villa theory can hardly take its .place." The question is what was the " common freeman," who remains. d'Azevedo (P. A.) Exogamia em CibOes no seculo XV. (Portugalia, Porto, 1903, I, 860-862.) Cites documentary evidence as to the practise of exogamy in the Portuguese frontier town of Ciboes Portugal, in the latter part of the 15th century. Botelho (H.) Instrumentos de bronze no conselho de Villa Real, Trazos-Montes. (Ibid., 825-827, 7 figs.) Describes bronze hatchets, socketed and unsock- eted, a bronze key and other objects. Brenha (J.) Dolmens ou antas no con- celho de Villa Pouca d'Aguiar. (Ibid., 691-706, i6 pl., and Io figs.) Describes the various groups of dolmens in Villa Pouca d'Aguiar, Traz-os-Montes, and the objects found in connection with them, sculptures, pictographs, flints, stone implements, pottery, "amulets" and symbolic objects, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic stones of a curious sort (plates xxxIv-xxxvI) and of great inter- est. The animal forms represent the rhi- noceros (?), elephant (?), deer, pig (?), cock, etc. Some of the stones, besides pictographs of animals have graphic signs or inscriptions, one of which the authoi interprets as a prayer to the sun. Note- worthy are three scenes of primitive life : A man with bow and arrow shooting a deer, and another similar picture ; a man seated on a deer holding bow and arrow in left hand while seizing the animal's horns with his right. Such signs of burial as were observed pointed to inhu- mation with occasional cremation. The pictographic and alphabetic (?) data of Villa Pouca d'Aguiar are an important addition to our knowledge of neolithic art in western Europe. Breuil (L'Abbe) L'Age du bronze dans le bassin de Paris. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1903, xIv, 501-518, 8 figs.) This fourth section treats of bronze arrows and lances from the Somme basin, their geographical distribution, classification, workmanship, ornamentation, etc. In the Somme region bronze arrowheads are rare and the lances there found are gen- erally inferior in form and strength to those from the rest of the Paris basin. Burmeister (Dr) Gross-Dimon. (Glo- bus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 219- 223, 6 figs.) An account of the Faroe island Great Dimon and its bird-catch- ers from Capt.

Une nouvelle grotte k par- ois grav6es . l'6poque prehistorique. La grotte de Teyat, Dordogne. (R. de l'Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, XIII, 364-367.) Brief account of the cave of Teyat in Dordogne and the animal- figures made on its walls by prehistoric man (horses, bisons, cows, antelopes, etc.) Teyat is the ninth cave in which Quaternary sculptures and paintings have been discovered. Cartailhac (k.) Les stations de Bru- niquel sur les bords de l'Aveyron. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1903, xIv, 129-150o, 295-315, 133 figs.) Treats of the Chateau rock-shelters, the Grotte des Batuls, the Grotte du roc du Cour- bet, etc., and the art remains of pre- historic man there discovered: nicked flints, stone beads, horn harpoons, batons, carved and figured pieces and objects of horn and bone, fish-hooks (?), amulets, etc. Certain objects of bone are thought</page><page sequence="8">168 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 6, 1904 to be throwing-sticks or something of the sort, which paleolithic man may have used. Some others may be like the Australian "message-sticks." Chesnau (M.) Sur la composition de bronzes pr6historiques de la Charente. (C.-R. Ac. d. Sci., Paris, 190o3, cxxxvII, 653-656.) Chemical analysis of three bronze implements from an urn-deposit at Venat shows the composition of each to be such as to confirm the opinion that the objects belong to the "cache " of a bronze-caster. An axe from Maison- Blanche is of different provenance. Cooley (A. S.) The bronze Hermes from Antikythera. (Rec. of Past., Washing- ton, 190o3, I1, 207-213, 2 ills.) De- scription and appreciation of the bronze statue, thought to be Hermes, brought up from the bottom of the sea by Syrnean divers off the coast of Antikythera in 9goo-1goI. Based on the account in the Ephemeris Archaiologikl. The statue was "restored" by M. Andre. D'Arbois de Jubainville (M.) Le pan- talon gaulois. (Rev. Arch6ol., Paris, 1903, 337-342.) Ethnographic study of the brac, or trousers, of the ancient Gauls, which bear a name of Teutonic origin. Under the empire the Romans adopted to a considerable extent this Gaulish garment. Etnier (Ruth S.) Iceland the heroic nation. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1903, XXXII, 473-481, 6 figs.) General account of history, education, literature, industries, houses, etc. According to the author the Icelanders " are scarcely second to the Russians in linguistic ability, many of them speaking five or seven languages." Fortes (J.) A necropole dolmenica de Salles. (Portugalia, Porto, 190o3, I, 665-686, 14 figs.) Describes the neo- lithic dolmen burial-place of Salles, north of Barroso. Poverty in content and lack of osseous remains are noteworthy. The megaliths are of variable orientation. No metal objects. The pictographs are parallel and undulating lines, etc. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) Cause probabili della bassa statura in. Italia. (Arch. di Psichiatria, etc., Roma, 19o3, xxIv, repr., pp. 4. ) Among the normal causes of the low stature of the Italians are to be reckoned race and economic conditions, as Lombroso and Livi have noted. To these the author would add a third, local endogamy with consanguineous mar- riages. The effect of island environ- ment in apparently decreasing the stat- ure of their inhabitants (e. g., Sardinia), and the results of subtraction (by war, etc. and emigration) are also to be con- sidered. Ilberg (G.) Das Gewicht des Gehirns und seiner Theile von 102 an Dementia paralytica verstorbenen mAnnlichen Sachsen. (Allg. Z. f. Psychiatrie, Ber- lin, 1903, LX, 330-374, tables.)

Brief account of anthropological investi- gations among the 96 foreign (and abo- riginal) peoples of Russia. The bibli- ography (pages 119-134) relates to 96 tribes and peoples, small and great, from the Abadzek of the Caucasus to the Ya- kuts. The Ainu, Armenians, Jews, Kal- mucks, Kirghis, Ossetes, and Tatars are well represented in the list of titles. Jaeger (J.) Speier am Rhein. (Globus, Brnschwg., I903, LXXXIV,-37-41.)

(Svenska Landsmilen, Stockholm, 1902, xxI, 1-216, I pl., map.) This valuable monograph, de- voted to the phonology of the mountain dialect of Virmland, is based on material obtained in 1898-I9oo. It was accepted as a thesis for Ph.D. at Upsala in 1902. A number of speech-curves, after the " graphic method," are given. ten Kate (H.) Neuere Publikationen von Dr Robert Lehmann-Nitsche. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 48- 49.) Brief notes on Dr Lehmann- Nitsche's articles on the Gryptotherium, Patagonian craniology, pathological phe- nomena in Peruvian ceramic ornamenta- tion, etc. Keller (L.) Ueber den Geheimbund der Vehme und der Vehmgenossen. (Monatsh. d. Comenius-Ges., Berlin,</page><page sequence="9">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 169 1903, XII, 27-34.) General discussion utilizing and supplementing Lindner's Die Vehme (Miinster, 1888), Philippi's Das Westfdlische Vehmgericht (Stettin, I888), and Thudichum's Vehmgericht und Inquisition (Giessen, 1889). The ecclesiastical use of these secret organi- zations deserves special attention. Lissauer (A.) Legende zur Typenkarte fir die Radnadeln. (Corr. -B1. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, XXXIV, 49-52, IO figs.) Lists the finding places of" wheel "-needles with- out "ears" (7), one-eared (24), two- eared (2), three-eared (9), four-eared (7). The distribution of these needles with radiform top is of considerable inter- est for Central European archeology. McLaughlin (A.) The storm center in the Balkans. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1903, LXIV, 173-176.) Brief notes on Turks, Slavic, Roumanian, Greek, and Albanian peoples. Author takes anti- Russian point of view. Marlot (H.) Notes pr6historiques sur le Morvan et les contr6es limitrophes. (R. de l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, XIII, 424-430o. ) Treats of paleolithic and neo- lithic remains (flints, hatchets, etc.), bronze objects (few), tumuli, megaliths, enclosures. Joigny and Sens on the Yonne seem to have been the centers of dispersion of paleolithic flints. Spring- cults and rock-cults once flourished extensively in the Morvan, and remnants still survive in folk-custom and folk-lore. de Mathuisieulx. Reisen in Tripolitanien. (Globus Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 42- 48, 56-6o, i6 figs.) Contains notes on cave-dwellers of Gariana, Berber ruins, remains of Roman edifices and monuments, the Berbers of the Rumya oases, the ruins of Leptis Magna, Tarunah, etc. The number and significance of the ruins in these mountains have been exaggerated.

Brief descriptions of 13 out-door and 6 in-door plays and games of Portuguese children of Algarve. Pag6s-Allary (J.), DWchelette (J.), et Lauby (A.) Le tumulus Arverne de Celles, prbs Neussargues, Cantal. (L' Anthropologie, Paris, 1903, xIv, 385- 416, 39 figs.) Describes tumulus of Celles and remains there discovered objects of iron, bronze, pottery, a stone hand-mill, etc. Iron objects are numer- ous, bronze few, coins and fibulae absent, pottery (non-Roman) abundant. The authors conclude that the tumulus was intended to receive the ashes of some Auvergnian, who lived shortly before Vercingetorix. The finds prove the skill of the Gauls in metallurgy and ceramics. Peixoto (R.) A pedra dos namorados. (Portugalia, Porto, 1903, I, 807-80.) Describes a "lovers' stone," from near the Luso-Roman station of Bilhares, now in the City Museum of Oporto. The stone has sculptured upon it a lov- ing couple face to face, in the rude fash- ion of Lusitanian art. - Do emprego ainda recente d'uma m6 manual. (Ibid., 828-831, 6 figs.) Treats of the recent employment of stone hand- mills in various parts of Portugal. --0 basto. (Ibid., 822-833, 2 figs.)

Un cas curieux de d6pig- mentation non cong6nitale chez une femme Tsigane. (Ibid., 317-321.) Describes a case of progressive albinism, involving up to the time of observation in 1902 all the body except most of the face, in a Roumanian Gypsy woman (aged 30) of the Dobrudja. The body is well developed and no degenerative stigmata were observed. No ancestral cases of albinism were discovered, and no unusual condition of parents at birth. - Les Skoptzy. La castration chez l'homme et les modifications anthropo- m6triques qu'elle entraine. (Ibid., 463-</page><page sequence="10">170 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 6, x904 491.) After brief historical sketch, author gives details of measurements made in 1902 of 30 male Skoptzy from the Dobrudja, where there are two vil- lages of this sect. The effect of castra- tion is to decrease the absolute and rela- tive growth of the bust, the head, the skull, and to increase the absolute and relative growth of stature, and lower half of body, and probably also that of the ear. Russischen (Die) Sekten. (Globus, Brn- schwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 193-194.) Brief accounts, after the Report for 1899 of the Procurator of the Holy Synod, of the Raskolniks, Stundists, Mormons, Tchuri- kowists, Dukhobors, Molokans, Male- wanzy, Chlysty, etc. The Tchuriko- wists are a new sect discovered in 1899 in the Government of Ssamara. In the same year sectional divisions arose among the Molokans. The Malewanzy have been for some time past growing in strength. Santos Rocha (A.) Mobilario neolithico disperso no concelho de Nellas, Beria Alta. (Portugalia, Porto, 1903, I, 8Io- 812, 5 figs.) Brief account of neolithic implements, etc., from Villa Seco, among them several perforated stones. - Ruinas Romanas de An9d. (Ibid., 813-816, 3 figs. ) Describes briefly the Roman ruins of Anga and the remains found there, walls, mosaic. Some of the ornamental types are indigenous and pre-Roman. - e Nunez (J. J.) A necropole luso- romana nos arredores de Lagos. (Ibid., 816-817.) Notes on the Luso-Roman burial-place near Lagos. Evidences of both inhumation and incineration are present - a rare thing in Portugal. Schliz (A.) Neue schnurkeramische GriTberfunde bei Heilbronn a. N. (Corr.- Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miin- chen, 1903, xxxiv, 6o.) Note on the discovery, in the Grossgartach country, of a neolithic gravemound, in which were " schnurkeramisch " pottery and a skele- ton buried at length ; and, near Wimpfen, of a crouching skeleton in a stone-slab grave. Schoetensack (0.) Der durchlochte Zier- stab (Fibula) aus Edelhirschgeweih von Klein-Machnow. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, IO7-110, 4 figs.) De- scribes the perforated ornament or fibula of stag-horn, possibly paleolithic, from Klein-Machnow in the Havel country, which has scratched upon it designs which the author thinks may be intended to represent fishweirs ! Dr Schoetensack sees in the discovery of this object further evidence of the northeastern drift of the reindeer-hunters of prehistoric western Europe in the wake of the animal itself. Schumacher (K.) Die bronzezeitlich- en Depotfunde Siidwestdeutschlands. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anth., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIv, 90o-Io, map.) Treats briefly of the finds of the bronze age in southwestern Germany --alto- gether some 50 certain and some 30 doubtful "collective finds" have been recorded. Some of these doubtless rep- resent votive gifts to the gods, others relics of the work-places of local metal- smiths; most, however, come from trade deposits and are often packed away in a great jar or a box. They show the development of traffic and commerce in this region, the influence of the East, etc. Schwalbe (G.) Ueber eine umfassende Untersuchung der physisch-anthropolo- gischen Beschaffenheit der jetzigen Bev6lkerung des Deutschen Reiches. (Ibid., 73-83.) After referring to the studies and investigations of Virchow, Deniker, Ripley, Ammon, Ranke, Pfitz- ner, Dr Schwalbe outlines plans for obtaining anthropometric data concern- ing at least 50 percent of the male population of Germany between 20 and 25 years of age. The recruiting service and hospitals must be called upon for much. A unitary scheme of measure- ment must be adopted - such a one is given on page 83. Severo (R.) Os dolmens de Traz-os- Montes. (Portugalia, Porto, 1903, I, 687-690.) General observations based on investigations in 1898 and 1901, serv- ing as introduction to the article of Brenha (q. v.). - Commentario ao espolio dos dolmens do Concelho de Villa Pouca d'Aguiar. (Ibid., 707-750, 16 figs.) Discusses the "amulets," zo6morphic and anthro- pomorphic sculptures, drawings, inscrip- tions, "alphabetic " characters, etc., discovered at Villa Pouca d'Aguiar. Some of the stones seem to figure Echin- oidea. Some of the Alvio statuettes resemble the Zufii fetishes of Cushing.</page><page sequence="11">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 17 I In some respects the art-specimens of the Alvao dolmens exhibit "a localization of character that is suigeneris." These remains testify likewise to the " autonomy of primitive European civilizations." Cupped and pitted stones occur. Certain inscriptions (the author compares 34 dolmen-signs, p. 745, with the alphabets of the Mediterranean) would seem to contain real alphabetic signs. da Silva (A.) A alfaia maritima da ilha de S. Miguel. (Ibid., 834-846, 21 figs.) Treats of fishing apparatus and accessories of the natives of the island of S. Miguel in the Azores- boats, nets, traps, hooks, lines, etc. da Silva Picio (J.) Ethnographia do Alto Alemtejo. (Ibid., 751-756.) Sketches of life and its activities among the mountaineers in Elvas. Continuation. Szombathy (J.) Der diluviale Mensch in Europa. (Globus, Brnschwg., I903, LXXXIV, 319-324, 5 figs.) Resumes Hoernes' Der diluviale Mensch in Eu- ropa, Braunschweig, 1903. (See Am. Anth., v, 695.) For Hoernes, North Africa "is the Orient of diluvial Europe." Tetzner (F.) Zur Sprichw6rterkunde bei Deutschen und Litauern. (Ibid., 61-63. ) After discussing nature and content of proverbs, the author cites, for comparison with the corresponding ones in German, some 50 Lithuanian proverbs relating to " the powers that be," one's fellowman, etc. The peasant-people of the Lithua- nians feel perhaps more the gulf be- tween the world of authority and the ordinary man and give it sharper ex- pression. Proverbs in general differ rather in expression than in content. - Lock- und Scheuchrufe bei Litauern und Deutschen. (Ibid., 87-89.) Treats of the "call" and "scare" words for domestic animals in the German and Lithuanian tongues. Of these there are five "strata." Thomas (P. F.) Ceramica negra nos districtos de Coimbra e Aveira. (Portu- galia, Porto, 1903, I, 821-823, 2 figs.) Brief description of the " black pottery " of Coimbra, etc., produced today by fumigation, as was perhaps also the case in ancient Etruria.

Ob' antropologiches- kagom' izyachenil slavyanskago naelen- iya Rossii. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1902, III, No. I, 102-III.) Resumes his own and others' (particu- larly Anutchin's) investigations on the physical characters of the Slavonic peo- ples of Russia. According to Vorobiev the primitive Slavonic type is tall, brunet, brachycephalic. The bibliography (pp. io8-II1) has sections on the Great Rus- sians, Little Russians, White Russians. Wateff (S.) Anthropologische Beobach- tungen der Farbe, der Augen, der Haare und der Haut bei den Schulkindern von den Tiirken, Pomaken, Tataren, Ar- meniern, Griechen und Juden in Bulga- rien. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIV, 58-60.) Gives tables of percentages for 45,418 (boys, 23,824) Turkish, 338 Pomak, 474 Tatar, 737 Armenian, 2,838 Jew- ish, and 4,589 Greekish children from 6 to 15 years of age in Bulgaria as to color of eyes, hair and skin. The proportion of the blond type (12.96 percent) is highest among the Turks, the brunet (78.69 percent) among the Armenians, the mixed (55.15 percent) among the Pomaks. The highest proportion of blue eyes (21.14 percent) occurs among the Turks, the lowest (4.90 percent) among the Armenians. Weissenberg (S.) Die Karder der Krim. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 139-143, 4 figs.) Treats of the phys- ical characteristics, with results of meas- urements, of 20 men and Io women - family life and social diversions, religion, festivals, condition of women, funeral rites, etc., of the Karaites (earlier in Jewish history, Ananites) of the Crimea. They seem to be more brachycephalic than the Jews and show oftener the Sem- itic nose. In children Mongolian facial characters are often very marked. They are looked down upon by the Jews, but are very proud of their Russian citizen- ship. Dr Weissenberg notes the be- ginnings of decay among this interesting people. Welter (Hr) Die Maren oder Mardel- len: keltische Wohngruben in Lothrin- gen. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f.

L'origines des Celtes. (L'- Anthropologie, Paris, 1903, XIv, 493- 499.) General discussion of the ethnic position of the Celts and the "brachy- brunets," Homo apinus. The "true Celts" are of dolichocephalic race. Wil- ser agrees with Holtzmann in relating the term Celt to Latin calo, old Norman kalr', German Held, "man," "hero." Zaborowski (M.) Origine europ6enne des Aryens de l'Asie. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1904, 5e s., I, 1-7.) Points out how western Asia was Aryanized from ancient Europe. The Aryan problem is to be solved on the basis of an auto- nomic development in Europe, from which center an ethnic stream flowed eastward into western and central Asia. The Persians, e. g., sprang from the neolithic race of southern Russia. Zemmrich (J.) Die Polen im Deutschen Reich. (Globus Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 213-219, 2 maps.) Discusses the geographical distribution, increase and decrease of the Polish population of the German Empire in 189o-I9oo. In Prussia the Poles have increased in Io8 districts, decreased in 62. In East Prussia the Polish-Masuric population shows an absolute decrease, due to west- ward migration. In West Prussia the larger part of the province shows Polish increase, and Posen shows a large in- crease also. The westward drift has af- fected Brandenburg, Hanover, and Rhen- ish Westphalia. AFRICA Bernard (A.) Productions naturelles, agriculture et industrie au Maroc. (Rev. g6n. d. Sciences, Paris, 1903, xiv, 73- 87, 9 figs.) The section on industries treats of fire-arms and other weapons, basketry, carpets, leather-work, pottery, etc. The pottery industry is concentrated at Fez and Saffi. - Le commerce au Maroc. (Ibid., 132-147, 4 figs.) Interesting account of the commercial activities of a country possessing practically neither roads nor bridges; native and foreign trade. Inse- curity, not absence of ways of communi- cation, is the great bar to the development of trade and commerce. Bibre (La) des Cafres. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, I903, 4e s., XX, 602-603.) Describes, after the account of M. Loir in Revue d'Hygidne for October, 1903, the making of beer by the women of the Matabeles of Bulawayo. Caustier (E.) L'Ame soudanaise. (Rev. g6n. d. Sciences, Paris, 1903, XIv, 61- 62.) R6sums s an address by Dr Barot before the Union Coloniale Fran&lt;aise on the black races of the Soudan.

Brief account of the capital of the German protectorate in East-Africa and the condition of life there for Europeans, etc. Destenave (Lieut. Col.) Le lac Tchad. II. Les habitants, la faune, la flore. (Rev. g6n. d. Sciences, Paris, 1903, xIv, 717-727, 19 figs.) Contains notes on the natives of the islands in Lake Tchad, the Kuris, Budumas, etc. Agriculture, political and social organi- zation, trade and commerce, boats, houses, clothing, arms, domestic animals, hunting, etc., are considered. These islanders possess a special breed of cattle, Their reed pirogues and wooden floats are interesting. Doutt6 (E.) Les Marocains et la soci6t6 Marocaine. I, Les origines et l'histoire.

The author objects to the distinction between Arabs and Berbers, the ensemble being really Berber, the so-called Arabs being only the most Islamized. Fies (F.) Der Yamsbau in Deutsch-Togo, (Globus, Brnschwg, 1903, LXXXIV, 266-272, 4 figs.) Interesting account of the planting, cultivation, digging, storing and cooking of yams among the Ewe negroes.

Treats of music and dancing, wilde- beest-dance, "doctors' dance," pro- cedure of shamans, bodily ornament- face-painting, etc., among the Bush, men. In contrast with those of the Herero, the Bushmen songs are gen- erally "Lieder ohne Worte" ; they are also less obscene in their dances; with them women are likewise more life-com- panions. Face-painting has a religious significance and is performed by the sha- mans. Die Verbindungsstrassen durch die nordliche Kalahari. (Ibid., 265-366, map.) Brief account of the roads over the northern Kalahari desert. Inderansiedelungen (Die) bei Tanga. (Ibid., 74-76, 2 figs.)

Interesting descriptions of dwellings and house-building among the Ewe, Guan, in Apai and Kratyi among the Haussa, in Salaga, in the hinterland in Adele, among the bush-tribes in Temu, etc. In central and northern Togo the houses are round, while among the Ewe the square variety, due probably to European influence, prevails. Ash- anti influence is evident in Bo6m, Nkunya, etc. In Atakpama and Ak- prossa two-story square houses of clay occur. von Liebert (E.) Die Besiedelung Deutsch-Ost-Afrikas. (Ibid., 261-263.) Ways of communication, markets, etc., are necessary for development and utili- zation of such sections as are habitable by Europeans. Seidel (H.) Kamerun im Jahre 1902. (Ibid., 93-95.) Contains a few notes on whites, negroes, etc. Singer (H.) Aus den Ruinen von Sim- babye. (Ibid., 176-178.) R6sumbs Mennell's The Zimbabwe Ruins (Bulu- vayo, 1893).

Smith (G. E.) The so-called "Affen- spalte " in the human (Egyptian) brain. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1903, xxIv, 74-83, 6 figs. ) Author holds that "the so-called 'Affenspalte' is not the exclusive prop- erty of the apes, because it certainly is present in the great majority of, if not in all, human brains." It was found not to be absent once in several hundred Egyptian brains. - The "limbus postorbitalis" in the Egyptian brain. (Ibid., 139-141, I fig.) Out of 36 adult brains 22 show this peculiarity, with tendency to develop on left side. Weisberger (F.) Voyage de reconnais- sance au Maroc. II, Climat, flore, faune, population. (Rev. g6n. d.

A spirited protest against the recent characterization of the Jap- anese by ten Kate (See Amer. Antkrop., 1903, N. S., V, 159), which Dr BAlz con- siders mistaken, one-sided, and pessimis- tic. Bilz emphasises the possession by the Japanese of the warlike spirit, neo- phily, joie de vivre, sense of humor, etc. Even 20 years ago Japan was a curiosity ; today it is a world-power. The transi- tion state of the Japanese people is also to be remembered in this discussion. Bois (D.) Les produits v6g6taux l'ex- position d'Hanoi. (Rev. g6n. d. Sci- ences, Paris, 1903, xIv, Ioo3-Ioo8.) Notes on the cultivation and use of plants and their products of Farther India. Brown (A. J.) Industrial training in Asia. (So.

Simulation of accouchement by the husband is in vogue. Flint (J. M.) Chinese medicine. (Smiths. Misc. Coll., Washington, 1903 [1904], Quart. Iss., I, 18o-I82.) Brief account of theories of disease, examination of patient, knowledge of anatomy, materia medica. The author thinks "it can hardly be doubted that a system of medical practice was established in China long before any now known to have existed among western nations." Knowledge of anatomy was crude, ex- aminations of bodies of the dead not being allowed. The yin and yang theory controlled medical practice. The Pen-ts'ao, or synopsis of materia medica .(latest edition 1826), treats of 1892 drugs, in Io,ooo formulae. Ghosu-el-Howie (Mrs) Rock sculptures at Nahr-el-Kelb. (Rec. of Past, Wash- ington, 1903, II, 195-207, 5 ills.) These rock sculptures include 3 Egyptian and 9 Assyrian. Some are of no little historical importance, and one was said in 1882 to contain an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar. - The Buddhist relic mound at Sopara. (Ibid., 297-307, 3 figs.) Reproduces from the Bombay Gazetteer the account of the opening of this mound in 1882 and the discovery of the begging bowl of Gautama and other relics. Henning (C. L.)

Coll., Washington, 1903 [1904], Quart. Iss., I, 149-167, 22 figs.) Interesting account of hats and headdress in a coun- try where "the people have hats for all occasions," and where "the hat is in fact a badge of honor and its absence a sign of disgrace." Butchers have been allowed to wear hats only since 1895 ; many styles have not changed since the time of Confucius. Hat pins, but- tons, hat-boxes, etc., are also considered. Even in the house the Korean wears a gauze hat. There is also a hat-umbrella. Some of the hats show remarkable skill in horsehair-work. In Korea women are almost hatless (having only about half a dozen styles), but children have 12 styles and men about 65. Koganei (A.) Ueber die Urbewohner von Japan. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, Ioi-Io6, 118-123.)

Koganei is of opinion that the little group of North Kurile Aino on Shiko- tan are "a ' missing link' between the Stone-age Aino and the Iron-age Aino." The Koropokguru, if not a mythic peo- ple, were Aino, and the whole matter is to be summed up thus: Japan was once an Aino land. Meyer (M.) Zur Theorie japanischer Musik. (Z. f. Psych., Leipzig, 1903, xxxIII, 289-306, I fig., 3 mus. ex.) Based on examples of Japanese music given in Abraham und Hornbostel's Studien ilber das Tonsystem und die Musik derJapaner (1903). Japanese melodic structure differs much from European. The 7 is rather frequent in the former. The "minor key" is also notable. Myhrman (D. W.) Nya fynd i Babylon. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1903, xxIII, 269- 297, II figs.) R6sum6s the results of the German Oriental Society's excava- tions in the ruins of Hillah, 1899-1903. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLY- NESIA Ackerman (Jessie) Australia's native race. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1903, xxxII, 360-363.) Brief discus- sion of environment, life, social organiza- tion, food, weapons, marriage, etc. Bouchal (L.) Indonesischer Zahlenglaube. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, I.xxxIv, 229-234.) This unusually well docu- mented article treats of sacred numbers among the Indonesian peoples (Malays, Malagasy, Dyaks, Celebese, Sumatrans, Javans, etc.). Cosmology and cosmog- ony, mythology, legends, tales, soul-lore, magic, prophecy, love-charms, ceremo- nies of divers sorts, birth, pregnancy, menstruation, marriage, death and burial, etc., are considered. The numbers 3 and 7 are widespread, and the tribes who make much of 9 have a special word for it (not Io minus I as other tribes), and such peoples seem to have other ethnographic parallels. Nowhere is 13 unlucky. Flashman (J. F.) The evolution of the parieto-occipital fissure, as illustrated in some aboriginal brains. (Rep. Pathol. Lab. Lun. Dept. N. S. W. Gov., Syd- ney, 1903, I, 19-22, 2 pl.) Treats briefly of three aboriginal Australian and one adult (female) European brain. The author concludes that "the condi- tion, as found in the Australian aborig- ines, contains all the factors for the pro- duction of the condition as found in the European; in fact, the former is the predecessor of the latter." - Description of sulci of four brains of Australian aborigines. (Ibid., 23- 48, Io pl.) Details concerning brains of Joey Governor, a criminal; " Bob "; and two other males. The brain of Joey, in general, "presents no striking abnormality." Forster (A.) Kurzer Bericht ilber das Muskelsystem einer Papua-Neugebore- nen. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 19o3, XXIV, 183- 186.) Describes the muscular system of an 8-months-old Papuan child in com- parison with European child of about the same age. Variability considerable. Face-musculature atavistic. Musculature in general not so fixed and not quite so differentiated as with the European child. Gleason (R. P.) Industrial problems in the Philippines. (So. Wkmn., Hamp- ton, Va., 1903, XXXII, 529-535, 4 figs.) Averse to manual training in general, the Filipino takes best to things like telegraphy. In neatness, but not in ac- curacy of manual work, the Filipino boy exceeds the American. Here, as else where " you can't hustle the East." Jardim (J.) A ceramica em Timor. (Portugalia, Porto, 19o3, I, 823-825.) Describes briefly the manufacture of pot- tery by the natives of Baucan in Timor. Moore (C. B.) The Boro Budur temple of Java. (Rec. of Past, Washington, 1903, II, 291-297, 4 ills.) Brief gen- eral description. The effect of these famous ruins is "4amazing," and they are now easily accessible to the traveler. Schmidt (E.) Ein angeblicher Beweis des tertiairen Alters des Menschen in Australien. (Globus, Bruschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 288-289.) Critique of Als- berg's discussion of the human footprints and impress of buttocks in a sandstone block now in the Museum of Wan- nambool, Victoria, and other alleged remains of Tertiary man (a worked bone, molars, etc.) from other parts of Aus- tralia.</page><page sequence="16">176 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, i904 Schmidt (W.) Beitrige zur Ethno- graphie des Gebietes von Potsdamhafen, Deutsch-Neuguinea. (Ibid., 76-81, 110-113, 123-127, 32 figs.) Describes, with discussion of native names and technical terms, signal drums, war- shields, "ancestral figures," masks, seats with heads, etc., from the Potsdam- hafen region of German New Guinea. This valuable article is based chiefly on material collected by Father Vormann. The author, against von Luschan, ex- cludes dream-figures as influencing the " figures of ancestors," and believes that the use of masks runs parallel with skull-cult. Stangl (P. L.) The Tagalo as an Amer- ican. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1903, XXXII, 462-464.) Good traits are excellent as an artisan, teachability, ca- pacity for progress, cautious (also very sensitive), domestic, religious, practical even in metaphysics, analytical, etc. Bad traits, vain, improvident, unveracious, too credulous and confiding (after his confidence is won), quick-tempered. He has in him "the elements necessary to become a valuable member of the family of nations, whether as an American or otherwise." von den Steinen (K.) Marquesanische Knotenschniire. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIv, io8-I 4, 9 figs.) Interesting account of knotted strings used by the priests of the Marquesas islands for mnemotechnic pur- poses, the technical terms and legends and songs connected with them. These knotted strings are chiefly used to ensure the remembrance of ancestral names and traditional verses, sentences, etc. Dr von den Steinen emphasizes the sugges- tive analogy of the Peruvian quiZus. AMERICA Alford (T. W.) The Shawnees of the present. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1903, XXXII, 385-386.) Impressions of a Shawnee, who has a very hopeful view of the condition of his people. Ambrosetti (J. B.) Las grandes hachas ceremoniales de Patagonia, probablemente pillan tokis. (An. d. Mus. Nac. de Buenos Aires, 1903, Ix, 41-5I, 7 figs.) Describes several ceremonial stone axes from various parts of Patagonia, of the sort thought to be identical with the pillan toki of the Araucanian-Calcha- quian region. Dr Ambrosetti considers them to be "votive axes," offered, e. g., to Pillan, or other deities, and these Pat- agonian specimens were probably of like use. Los pucos pintados de rojo sobre blanco del valle de Yocavil. (Ibid., 357-369, I8 figs.) Treats of the two series of ornamentation (red on white) on the pucos, or hemispheroidal dishes from the Yocavil region, one of the most interesting developments of ancient Calchaquian art. The basis of the first sort is center-pointing triangles, of the second center-crossing lines combined with bird-faces at the edges. Only I6 of these fucos are in archeological col- lections (the National Museum of Bue- nos Aires has io). - Cuatro pictografias de la regi6n Calchaqui. (An. d. 1. Soc. Cien. Arg., Buenos Aires, 1903, LVI, II6- 126, 5 figs.) Describes four pictographs from the Calchaqui region. One repre- sents, probably, a petition by Indian hunters of the guanaco to their deity; another, more complicated, in which a great serpent and many human and ani- mal figures appear, may be the r6sum6 of some myth or ceremony relating to rain- making, etc. - the caverns near by may have been kivas - or some legend of Catequil, etc. These Calchaquian pic- tographs deserve special study, for they seem to have more definite intent about them than has much of the ordinary Amerindian picture-writing. - I Calchaqui. (Boll. Soc. Geogr. Ital., Roma, 19o3, repr., pp. 18, 4 figs. ) R6sum6s data concerning the Calchaqui and their culture. Habitat, Peruvian knowledge, art, crania, myth- ology, etc., are briefly considered. Dr Ambrosetti calls attention to the paral- lelism between the Calchaqui and the Pueblo Indians of Arizona and New Mexico- environment, petroglyphs, cer- amics and their ornamentation, stone and other implements, animal fetishes, masks, myths, symbolism, etc., of water and agriculture. These parallels might well be made the subject of a detailed and comprehensive monograph. Baum (H. M.) The Cahokia mound. (Rec. of Past, Washington, 1903, 11, 215-222, IO figs.) General descriptive discussion. Dr Baum holds that the Cahokia mound could never have been</page><page sequence="17">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 177 built by Indians, for while these erected burial mounds, their earliest efforts " are easily distinguished from the work of the Mound Builders, properly so-called." He also thinks that the further study of the crania of the American Mound Build- ers will show that they "differ as much from those of the historic American Indians as do those of the Asiatic Mound Builders from those of the present inhab- itants of those countries." Justification for such opinion is hardly visible. Carlton (F. T.) The growth of rural population. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1903, LXIV, 177-181.) Based on the U. S. censuses of I890 and I9go00. In the north central and New England States "the rural sections, taken as a whole, are not being depopulated, but are increasing in population at a grad- ually accelerated rate." Those nearer large cities show greatest gain. Cattell (J. M.) Statistics of American psychologists (Amer. J. of Psych., Worcester, 1903, XIV, 3IO-328.) Gives interesting information as to fame and labor of the 200 working psycholo- gists of America, who, on the average, " make a contribution of some import- ance only once in two or three years." Prof. Cattell now inclines to believe that "psychologists are born, not made." Chamberlain (A. F.) Primitive taste- words. (Ibid., 146-153.) Discusses etymology and psychological bearings of general and particular (acid, astringent, bitter, peppermint, pungent, rancid, salt, sour, sweet) taste-words in various dia- lects of the Algonquian stock. Diguet (L.) Le Chimalhuacan et ses populations avant la conqu.te espagnole. (J. de la Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, 1903, N. S. 1, 1-57, 3 pl., maps.) Historical and ethnographical account of pre-Span- ish Chimalhuacan (Jalisco, Tepic, parts of Sinaloa, Zacatecas, and Aguas Ca- lientes). Ethnic divisions, dress, arts and industries, agriculture, religion, political geography, and the course of the Spanish conquest are treated of. Based on Tello, Beaumont, Mota Padilla, Frejes, and Navarrete. Remnants of an- cient costume, ceremonies, etc., still sur- vive in Tuxpan, although the "ethnic characters" of Chimalhuacan has almost entirely disappeared. A good paper. Dissette (Mary E.) Signs of progress in Pueblo day schools. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1903, XXXII, 465-472, 8 figs.) Among the signs of progress noted are "a disposition on the part of the Indians to provide better quarters for both teacher and pupils, "-observed in 9 villages; better equipment; rapid growth in the use of the English lan- guage; increasing regularity of attendance, -" our best day schools compare very favorably in this respect with the ordi- nary district school of the States." The Pueblo woman, who "rules the home and the children," is said to be "very much more conservative and non-pro- gressive than the husband." Dubois (Constance G.) The exiles of San Felipe. (Ibid., 607-6Io, 2 figs.) Treats of the enforced exile of the Hot Springs Indians of southern California. The condition of things at Pala is far from satisfactory. Ellis (Leonora B.) The Seminoles of Florida. (Gunton's Mag., N. Y., 1903, xxv, 495-505.) General historical and ethnographic sketch--habitat, agricul- ture, arts and industries (coontie-starch making), dwellings, cooking (sofkee- stew), marriage, status of women, canoe- making, government, religion, whites and Indians. The author notes the great distrust shown by the Seminoles toward the Americans today. Fehlinger (H.) Die Indianer Kanadas, (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, io6-IO7.) R6sum6s governmental re- ports. Increase from 99,527 in 1901 to IO8, I I2 in 1902, chiefly due to more complete enumeration. Fewkes (J. W.) Preliminary report on an archeological trip to the West Indies. (Smiths. Misc. Coll., Washington, 1903, Quart. Iss., I, 12-133, Io pl.) R6s- um6s results of investigations of Novem- ber, 1902, to May, 1903. After notes on excavations, cave exploration, col- lections, etc., Dr Fewkes describes stone implements (celts, chisels, balls, dishes, beads, mortars, rings, ornamented pes- tles), stone idols and amulets, stone disks with faces on one side, pottery, wood-carvings (cassava-graters, clubs, stools, serpents, idols, vomiting-sticks), shell and bone carvings, pictographs and rock-etchings. The importance of ex- cavations in Porto Rican caves, village sites and dance enclosures (juego de bola) is apparent from the success met with at Utuado, where ten skeletons and several AM. ANTH., N.

The collection brought back to Washington numbered over 12oo specimens. To the country people stone celts are piedras de rayo, or " thunder- stones." Dr Fewkes' expedition will add very much to our knowledge of the pre-Columbian Antilleans. Firstemann (E.) Inschriften von Yax- chilan. (Ibid., 81-83.) Discusses the Maya inscriptions of Yaxchilan published by Maler, bearing dates, the author thinks, of 1384, 1412, 1455, and 1157 A. D., the last long before the beginning of Maya culture in its characteristic form. One of the inscriptions is a monument to some distinguished man, another is re- lated to some cyclic event of importance. Froideveaux (H.) Nordenskj6ld Am6r- icaniste. (J. de la Soc. d.

Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1903, XXXII, 550-553.) Brief ac- count of " mission meeting" of Dakota- speaking Indians at Standing Rock, N. Dak. Author contrasts the large attend- ance with the slim meetings of the whites in such weather. Holmes (W. H.) Shell ornaments from Kentucky and Mexico. (Smiths. Misc. Coll., 19o3 [1904], Quart. Iss., I, 97- 99, 2 pl., I fig.) Describes briefly a conch shell gorget from a burial place near Eddyville, Kentucky, in compari- son with a similar gorget from Mexico, and an engraved piece of dark wood or bark from an ancient grave near Florence, Alabama. Professor Holmes thinks that the Kentucky figure "strongly suggests the idea that it must represent a disk- thrower engaged, possibly, in playing the well-known game of chungkee," while the resemblance of the bark figure "to certain delineations of spiders en- graved on shell gorgets . . . is very marked." Lejeal (L.) Le Congrbs de New York, (J. de la Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, 1903. N. S., I, 84-97.) Excellent appreciative r6sum6 of the proceedings of the Con- gress of Americanists at New York, October 20-25, 1902. Wittily and pleas- antly written, as one might expect from a French man of science and letters. M. Lejeal is not so much afraid of "Amerind" as were some who took part in the "logomachy" its use called forth. He also speaks of "the time- honored and luckless prejudice which makes the Old World the sole and necessary source of all civilization." The "IMan of Lansing, brother of him of Trenton," hardly appeals to the author. Nor does Mr Farwell's treat- ment of Indian music. - Thomas Wilson. (Ibid., 103-105.) Brief but very appreciative sketch of life and scientific activities. Le6n (N.) Los Tarascos. (Bol. d. Mus. Nac. de M6xico, 1903, 2a ep., I, 153- 169, 185-201, 217-233.)

Om grafvar och bo- platser i nordvistra Argentina frAn de s. k. Calchaquies. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1903, xxIII, 231-241, 9 figs.) Dis- cusses from his own researches and those of ten Kate, Quiroga, Lafone Quevedo, Ambrosetti, etc., the dwelling places and graves of northwestern Argentina, their pottery, ornamentation, etc. This Calchaquian "half-civilization" is at- tracting more and more attention. Northrop (Amanda C.) The successful women of America. Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1904, LXIV, 239-244.) Based on the 1902 edition of Who's Who in America. Statistics indicate that " col- lege-training has played a small part in woman's success" (15.5 percent of the 954 individuals concerned). Co-ed- ucational institutions have a distinct ad- vantage over separate woman's colleges, and private schools, seemingly, over public schools. Pilcher (Louise H.) Indian town offi- cers. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1903, xxxII, 411-413.) Brief account of the officials of the Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico, their duties and conduct - "1the laws are more strictly enforced than in many white villages, and the Indian officials make better officers than do the Mexican ones in the nearby towns." Plancarte (F.) y Le6n (N.) Noticia de un dialecto nuevo del Matlaltzinca. (Bol. d. Mus. Nac. d. M6xico, 1903, 2a ep., I, 201-204.) Letter of Sr Plan- carte containing vocabulary of 125 words, with comment by Dr Le6n. Reports discovery of this dialect in San Francisco, near Temascaltepec. Dr Le6n finds affinities with Ocuiltec, a Matlaltzincan language of the district of Tenancingo. The numerals of the new dialect are said to little resemble those of other Mexican languages. Prud'homme (L.-A.) Les premiers abo- rig6nes du Manitoba et du Nord-Ouest. (Rev. Canad., 1903, 262-176.) Treats briefly of Mandans, Sioux, Cree, Sau- teux. OutrH conclusions,-Mandans derived from northeast Asia, Sioux from Mongols, Crees and Sauteux from Scan- dinavians or Normans ! Rivet (M.) ttude sur les indiens de la region de Riobamba. (J. de la Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, 1903, N. s., I, 59-80.) Treats of physical characteristics, dress and ornament, houses, utensils, domestic animals, food and drink, disease, village life, marriage (quasi-indifference as to choice), birth, agriculture, work, di- vision of labor (apegado, concierto, libre, suelto), religion, superstitions and pre- judices, death-cult, etc. According to the author, La Condamine's description of these Indians a century ago "is still accurate in all points." They are chiefly barefoot, simply clothed, have few uten- sils or furniture, eat vermin, are largely frugal vegetarians, drink chicha, resist disease poorly, fear and hate the whites, are fetishistic and fanatic, mingling the heathen and the Christian, are born liars, less idle than indolent, home-lov- ing, servants of sorcery, dreams, etc., and reflect in their deportment the cen- turies of humiliation and servitude they have undergone. Seler (E.) Studien in den Ruinen von Yucatan. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIv, 114- II6.)

Report of the committee appointed by the Department of Justice and Edu- cation to investigate the alleged deposit of fossil human bones on the El Corte ranch at Ramos Arispe, in the state of Coahuila, Mexico. The remains turned out to be elephant bones, etc. West (G. A.) Summary of the archeology of Racine county, Wisconsin. (Wisc. Archeol., Milwaukee, 1903, III, 6-42, io figs.) After geographical and his- torical introduction, the author treats of Indian trails, remains in the city of Ra- cine and town of Mt Pleasant, towns of Caledonia, Raymond, Norway, Burling- ton, etc., and Racine county implements and ornaments. Racine county "has yielded to the archeological cabinets of the state and country rather more than its share of aboriginal implements and ornaments of clay, bone, horn, stone, copper, brass and iron." Evidences of aboriginal trade and war relations be- tween the Racine Indians and those of distant regions are furnished by the nature and the types of many of the objects. A rare specimen is an Iroquois pipe. The "Racine garden-beds," or Indian corn-fields, are of considerable interest. Dr Lapham and Dr Hay did much for the investigation of the mounds of Racine county. Williams (T.) The fallacy of the "se- lected group " in the discussion of the Negro question. (So. Wkmn., Hamp- ton, Va., 1903, XXXII, 520-526.) After pointing out that the mass of the ances- tors of the American Negroes came from Congo valley, "from a point at which the Negro race, from climatic reasons, was, on the whole, at its lowest point of development," while about the western highlands they made much greater prog- ress, concludes that in time they will also in America. To compare them as a group with the Anglo-Saxons of their present environment is fallacious.</page></plain_text>
