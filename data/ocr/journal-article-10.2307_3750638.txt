<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Books David Hume, Philosopher of Moral Science By Antony Flew Oxford: Blackwell, 1986, ix+ 189 pp., ?22.50, ?7.95 paper This book is a general and fairly comprehensive introduction to Hume's philosophy, set in the context of his own contention that he wished to put the moral sciences on a secure foundation, i.e. to do for the moral sciences what Newton had done for natural philosophy. Hume, Flew argues in Chapter 1 ('What is to be Done?'), was led astray from the very first by Descartes, for he accepted three erroneous Cartesian assumptions. These are (i) knowledge is possible only when it is inconceivable that there might be error, that is, Flew thinks, when the premises entail the conclusions. (Here 'knowledge' must be a slip for 'inferential knowledge'.) (ii) We are never non-inferentially aware of anything outside ourselves. (iii) Persons are essentially incorporeal. The first assumption, Flew thinks, leads Hume astray over induction, and is at least partly responsible for his scepti- cism. The second aggravates his scepticism, and mucks up his theory of meaning. The third produces Hume's erroneous views on the immateriality of the soul. In Chapter 2 ('Impressions, Ideas and the External World') Flew discusses, among other things, how, or so he thinks, the second Cartesian assumption vitiated Hume's theory of meaning. This assumption, however, was not shared by Hume, however carelessly his penchant for elegant casualness may have caused him to express himself. He said (in 'Of the immateriality of the soul') that impressions were substances (for what that notion was worth) and logically capable of existing without perceivers, though they could not do this infact because (he says in 'Of scepticism with regard to the senses'), they were dependent for their existence upon the perceiver's perceptual apparatus. (It will be remembered that Hume maintained (also in 'Of scepticism with regard to the senses') that there could be no such thing as unobserved objects, because they would be composed of unobserved impressions. There could be no such things as unobserved impressions, however, because impressions were depen- dent for their existence upon such things as eyes. The reply to this argument was that if there were unobserved objects, there could be no eyes (Hume's conclusion), so the existence of impressions could not depend upon eyes. The reply to this reply was that if there are eyes, impressions would be dependent for their existence upon eyes, which means that, if there are eyes, there are no eyes, which in its turn means that there are no eyes (since a proposition that implies its own falsity is false).) Even if Hume did share Descartes' second assumption, I doubt whether this would have the radical consequences that Flew and others think that it has. Flew puts great stress on the argument that we cannot define a word unless the 539</page><page sequence="2">New Books person teaching the word and the person learning it are using it of something of which they are both aware. If we are each shut within a world of our own ideas, we will not ever be aware of the same thing. It is not true, however, that I and some other person can attach the same meaning to a given word only if we are taught its meaning by being shown numerically the same thing. What we cannot do is teach a person the meaning of a word (by ostensive definition) unless the teacher and the person learning it are aware of the same sort of thing. For example, if someone is trying to teach me, by ostensive definition, what 'blue' means, he and I must both be aware of something blue, but it is unnecessary for us to be aware of the identical blue entity. Flew thinks that unless we are aware of the same blue entity, you cannot check that I am using the word correctly. But this is not sufficient. For me to have the kind of check Flew wants, it would not only be necessary for me to see the same thing that you see, when you say that this thing is blue. It would, as I believe Ayer has held, also be necessary for me to be aware of your awareness of it. And, in the last resort, we have to rely on an unchecked judgment of our own in deciding whether we are using a word correctly. For if I ask someone 'Am I applying the word "blue" correctly to this', and he says 'You are', I then have to rely on my own judgment that the words I hear emanating from his lips are the words 'You are' and not the words 'You are not'. I can repeat my check by asking someone else, or even the same man again, and this other person may say 'He said "You are", not "You are not"', but then again at this point I have to rely on my own judgment about the words emanating from the second person's lips, i.e. I have to accept, without checking, that the second man said 'He said "You are"'. Though there is no given point along this line at which I must stop, I must stop somewhere along it. And at whatever point I do stop, I have to rely on my own unchecked judgment concerning what is the case, in this example, the case concerning what someone said. (It seems to me that, when someone seems to tell me that the colour I see is called 'blue', I am putting forward an hypothesis about what the objects of his perception are like.) Flew's treatment of the sense-datum theory in this chapter is inadequate, as is that of most if not all contemporary philosophers. (Sense-data are roughly what Hume called 'impressions'.) Hume thought that we perceived them. Flew thinks we do not, but that they are presented perhaps in the pineal gland. (I did not understand what this remark meant. Is Flew suggesting that if we looked in someone else's pineal gland we wouldfind his sense-data, or that if we looked in our own pineal gland we would find our own?) The truth is that Hume thought, rightly, that we perceived sense-data or impressions and, also rightly, that we always perceived such things. One does not know what it would be like to see the moon without seeing a silver crescent or yellow disc, i.e. a sense-datum or impression of the moon, which reveal the moon and its characteristics to one, rather than prevent us from seeing it. If we did not see a crescent when we looked at the moon, we would not be seeing the moon. (Sense-datum theorists do not have to hold that they are entities. Berkeley certainly did not, for example.) Flew thinks we always see objects (like the aurora borealis or liver spots, for example) but it seems obvious that all we see is at most parts of the surfaces of objects, for example, that section of the surface of the moon which is illuminated by the sun. But the surface of an 540</page><page sequence="3">New Books object does not belong to the category of substance, so seeing surfaces is seeing something which is not itself a material object. And there is no reason why sense-data should not turn out to be identical with the visible parts of the surfaces of material objects, i.e. why 'sense-datum of X' and 'visible part of the surface of X' should not be two different descriptions of one and the same thing. (It would be naive, however, to suppose that they always were.) The sense-datum theorists often made two claims, one essential to the sense-datum theory, the other not. The inessential one was that sense-data were a kind of thing or substance. The essential one was that we could not perceive any material object without perceiving one of them, and that knowledge of the objects was mediated by knowledge of sense-data. The second, essential claim does not entail the first, and is, unlike the first, pretty obviously true. (It is only if sense-data were substances that their existence would compete with the claim of physicalists that physical particles are the only kinds of substances.) Flew, however, is unlike many very modern philosophers in his attitude to scientific realism. Some of them are so impressed by what scientists tell us about the world-scientists themselves do not have the same attitude of uncritical adoration-that they seem to see what scientists tell them is there, rather than what is actually under their noses. Instead of a world of shimmer- ing lights, dull haze, buzzing, blooming, throbbing pains, itches, twinges of jealousy, feelings of anger, and griping stomach-ache, they see a colourless dance of atoms in the void, because that is what they have been told is there. Some then tell us, implausibly, that this ordinary picture is a theory, and a wrong one, which is supplanted by the scientific account (though a theory cannot supplant the evidence upon which it itself is based without cutting off the branch on which it is sitting). Others tell us, implausibly, that statements describing the manifest image of the world can be deduced from a full description of the scientific fact. Yet others that, though we know what it is like to experience this world of colour and sound, there are no propositions describ- ing what it is like (though I have just described it) which knowledge being, like knowing Birmingham, non-propositional, is not something that is within their remit to explain. Hume and I think, to his credit, also Flew, have no truck with this view. According to Hume, the scientific objects which explain the phenomena, if they exist at all, lie behind the phenomena they explain. Causally, their absence would be disastrous, but phenomenologically, they would not be missed. I have said that this view owes its attraction to the success of modern science, and modern science is successful in its predictions. I do not see that, in order for it to have this success, however, it needs to be a complete account of the universe. In Chapter 3 ('Infinite Divisibility, Mathematics and Hume's Fork'), Flew discusses Hume's much despised views on mathematics, and his division of propositions into those which concern relations between ideas and those which concern matters of fact (Hume's Fork). This distinction Flew iden- tifies, as is usual, with the distinction between propositions which can be known a priori and cannot be denied without contradiction, and those which can be denied without contradiction, but can be known only empirically. (There is no discussion of recent views to the effect that there are some necessary propositions that can be known only empirically, and some con- 541</page><page sequence="4">New Books tingent facts that can be known a prori.) Flew thinks that Hume is wrong in thinking that this distinction is something to do with mental imagery. Flew holds (wrongly) that if it did have something to do with mental imagery, it would be a psychological distinction, not a logical one. Hume, however, was right in thinking that we could not form imagery of what it would be like for a true proposition concerning relations of ideas to be false, but could (if we were good enough at imaging) form such imagery when the true proposition in question concerned a matter of fact. Two and two are four, because any situation that would make it true to say that there were two groups of two things would make it true to say that there was a group of four things. And, Hume might argue, I know that two groups of two is equal to a group of four because any imagery (ideas) of what it is like to come across two groups of two things is ipso facto imagery of what it is like to come across a group of four things. I cannot form images of what it would be like for there to be two groups of two things, without their being equal to a group of four things. Hence, Hume thought, the distinction between relations between ideas and matters of fact could be made by considering what we could and could not form mental images of. (Flew does not discuss the interesting question whether the pro- position that all propositions concern relations between ideas or matters of fact is itself a proposition concerning relations of ideas or matters of fact. It ought, one would think, to be the latter.) Flew's account leaves out most of what is distinctive and interesting in Hume's theory. It is customary for modern philosophers to be excessively severe on Hume's (and Berkeley's) image theory of meaning. In defence of Hume may I say that he did not think that the word 'cow' was a word for images of cows. Nor did he think that we recognize cows by comparing cows with images of cows. What he did think was that our understanding the word 'cow', in the absence of cows, manifested itself in our being able to frame images of cows. He should have added, but did not, 'knowing that they were images of cows', to rule out the possibility that it was just coincidence that I saw the word 'cow' and then had a mental image of a cow. If this theory is extended to the meanings of whole sentences, it becomes the theory that I understand a sentence in the indicative mood if I can summon up imagery that resembles a situation which would make the proposition true. (It is a common mistake to say, 'makes the sentence true'.) Many modern views tend to make understanding a word or sentence wholly dispositional, i.e. I know what a sentence means if I would apply it to a situation which would make it, or the proposition it expresses, true, if I were to come across such a situation. This entails that I do not know whether I know what a word means or not until I discover whether or not I do apply it to such a situation. But I do know what words mean, or at least what I mean by them, without having to wait to see whether I use them correctly in the situations which they apply to. This suggests that understanding can involve a mental occurrence, and one account of this occurrence is to say that it involves having mental images. In Chapter 4 ('Argument from Experience, and the Religious Hypothesis'), Flew states his own solution to the problem of induction, which is that, since induction is a rational rule 'Where and so long as all known X's are or have been Y, to presume that all X's have been are and will be Y until and unless some 542</page><page sequence="5">New Books positive reason is found for revising this particular presumption', no question arises about how, if at all, it could be known to be true. But, though we know this has been found to be a good rule in the past, it will be a good rule to follow in the future only if we can expect what has been a good rule in the past to continue to be a good rule in the future, which involves relying on induction. The 'Cambridge solution' espoused by Ramsey, Braithwaite and, recently, by Mellor, that induction can be without circularity justified inductively, Flew ignores. Flew, in Chapter 5 ('The Necessity of Causes, and the Impossibility of the Miraculous') severely criticizes Hume's theory of causation (or one of them). If all we know is that all As have been followed by Bs, then this does not justify us in predicting that if anything had been an A, it, too, would have been followed by a B. What, Flew thinks, does justify this conditional is our practical experience of making things happen (an idea which I suspect is unduly anthropomorphic, because, though lightning may cause thunder, I doubt whether lightning makes thunder happen). But I suspect that, without repetition, we do not know whether we have made anything happen or not. We flip the switch, and there is a loud bang. Did we cause it, or did we not? We have to switch on the light again, and see if it goes on again. And the fact that we have been successful in making something happen in the past is no guarantee that we will go on being successful in the future. Hence I could not see how the fact (if it is one) that dropping a piece of china has in the past made it break justifies us in inferring that if this piece of china were dropped it would make it break again. Flew, too, is extremely critical (in Chapter 6 ('People, their Minds, their Souls and their Selves')) of Hume's views of the self, which he thinks are rather disastrously Cartesian. (Perhaps philosophers should get out of the habit of talking of the self, or (worse) the I, as if it was a kind of umbrella.) He himself takes an Aristotelian view of the mind, according to which it is no more a substance than the smile on the face of the tiger. Smiles, I suppose, presup- pose tigers, or at least the lips of tigers, which are substances, but Flew does not make it absolutely clear what it is that minds presuppose. Presumably it is either bodies or persons. He does not explain how Hume can make use of this view. For Hume, as we have seen, wants to say that there are good reasons for thinking that there are not any bodies. But if there are no bodies, and Hume is using the word 'I' for something when he thinks, what on earth is he using it for? Hume failed to find anything. But if he had not shrunk from the rather extreme, and perhaps heroic, conclusion that, since it is intended to refer to a person with a body, and there is no body, the word 'I' simply fails to refer, he might have avoided this difficulty, though perhaps at too high a price. (In this case, Descartes' argument 'I think, therefore I am' would be valid, but its premise, that I think (or that I think), would be untrue.) In Chapter 7 ('Catastrophic Scepticism, or Merely Academic?') Flew dis- cusses Hume's scepticism. He castigates Hume for advocating scepticism academically, but ignoring it in practice. But what else can an academic sceptic do? In any case, it is not strictly speaking inconsistent to make assertions that one has held it is impossible to know. The situation rather is that, in asserting these things, one is contextually implying that one is in a position to justify 543</page><page sequence="6">New Books them, which one has asserted no one is. In other words, the relation between asserting that the sun will rise tomorrow, and maintaining that there is no good reason for thinking that it will, is like the relation between asserting p and saying that one does not believe p, rather than the relation between asserting that induction can and that it cannot be justified. In discussing Hume's views on liberty and necessity in Chapter 8 ('Necessity, Liberty and the Possibility of Modern Science'), Flew complains that the only kind of necessity Hume admits elsewhere is not the same kind of necessity as that which he thinks is applicable to human actions here. He thinks that there is a strong sense of 'liberty' in which my liberty is incompatible with my actions being necessitated, but personally I have never discovered what this strong sense is. In Chapter 9 ('Values as Socially Projected'), Flew argues that the is/ought distinction is a distinction between describing and prescribing. He argues that when Hume says 'when you pronounce any character to be vicious, you mean [my italics] nothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it'. Hume, Flew thinks, could not have been saying what he seems to be saying (a) because he was not interested in 'controversies merely verbal' (which Flew construes as meaning that Hume was not interested in questions about meaning) and (b) because this view is erroneous. He could have added another bad argument: (c) Hume says things inconsistent with this view in other places. Flew's view is that Hume was a projectivist (whatever that may be). This is open to two criticisms. First, Hume was not a projectivist and, secondly, projectivism is not a very good view to saddle Hume with anyway. (I have discussed Mackie's projectivism in an earlier issue of Philosophy (April 1982).) In Chapter 10 ('Evolutionary Emergence, or Contractual Creation?') Flew argues, correctly, that 'Hume's approach to the origin of social institutions is evolutionary, rather than creationist'. Moral rules are the result of men's attempts to regulate the damage done by their own unbridled selfishness and (Flew forgets to say) confined generosity and short-sightedness. Flew could have said that all men are in a 'prisoner's dilemma situation' with respect to one another, in that it is in the interest of each individual man to be immoral, whether others are or not, though collectively it is in man's interest to be moral. The only way to overcome this is to have a sentiment which compels most men to be moral, whether or not it is in their interest. Flew could have said that a tendency to invent and observe moral rules has been favoured by natural selection as a way of limiting man's short-sightedness and selfishness, which would lead to his ruin if uncontrolled. To some extent Flew's outlook on Hume is excessively dated. He uses the argument from standard samples too readily. He seems to think that founda- tionalism is obviously true. He accepts uncritically Wittgenstein's private language argument. He is aggressive in manner. (He uses the word 'aggressive' as an adjective of commendation no less than four times on page 45.) He does not seem to be aware that the distinction of propositions into those which it is logically contradictory to deny and are a priori and those which it is not logically contradictory to deny and are empirical, has been questioned. He ignores the view that induction can be justified inductively. He sometimes 544</page><page sequence="7">New Books takes Hume too literally, and does not allow for the calculated casualness of his expression. Some of the swashbuckling gives the appearance of being over- confident. Nevertheless, Flew covers a great deal of ground in a helpful and interesting way. The book is constantly enlivened by provocative remarks on controver- sial issues, and is much enriched by Flew's great erudition. Flew shows an enviable familiarity with Hume's work. He expresses many interesting and forceful criticisms of Hume, and his book is densely packed with argument and information. I enjoyed reading Professor Flew's book, and approved of a good deal of it. It is certainly not a book anyone interested in Hume can afford to ignore. Jonathan Harrison</page></plain_text>
