There is no evidence, however, to clarify whether a coregency between these monarchs existed or not. Nearly all the construction and decoration of the temple occurred within the first four to five years of Ramesses II's reign with the exception of the outside walls. The doorway inscriptions in the chapels and on other temple walls demonstrate conclusively that the forms of the names of Ramesses II cannot be used as a reliable dating criterion. In fact, the supposedly diagnostic forms of the so-called nomen or throne-name - Rr-ms-s vs. Rr-ms-sw - are not reliable chronological indicators, but rather their use appears to have been influenced primarily by the format of the inscription, i.e., whether a text was in columnar or horizontal format. The appearance of various epithetical elements in Ramesses II's cartouches were likewise influenced by similar design factors instead of ideological considerations. Introduction In January 2008, the authors of this article inaugurated the New York University epigraphic project in the temple of Ramesses II at Abydos. We are grateful to the Ministry of State for Antiquities for granting us the permission to work with their Department of Documentation as a joint expedition. The first season in 2008 was devoted essentially for the exploration of the temple and its physical conditions as well as other logistic matters. The season in 2008-2009 was dedicated to the digital photography of the temple relief scenes. Subsequently, line drawings were digitally produced from the photographs. The field collation of the drawings started during the season in 2009-2010, and con tinued during our latest season in 2011-2012. At present, we have produced all of the line drawings of the temple scenes and inscriptions and collated nearly all these in preparation for a comprehensive publication of the architectural, photographic and epigraphic record of the temple. This publication will also include a detailed Conservation Condition Report to serve as basis for future restoration plans in the temple. The present article presents some initial results of our study of the construction history of the temple and its purpose. We hope in particular that the results of some of our epigraphical work will also demonstrate how the forms of the royal name underwent an experimental phase in which several 143</page><page sequence="2">144 JARCE 48 (2012) variants of his titulary were tested, so to speak, before finally settling on one or two primary forms.1 These shifts may well have been influenced primarily by calligraphic considerations rather than any ideological factors. In the course of this discussion we also hope to show that attempts to date the monuments of Ramesses II according to the writing of his titulary rest upon some rather shaky foun dations and should viewed with considerable caution. Previous Study Given its importance, it is hardly surprising that the Abydos temple of Ramesses II has been dis cussed in a vast array of books and articles. In this section, we shall attempt to concentrate on those works that were focused primarily on this site, rather than to try to present an inclusive listing. The first attempt to record the temple began during the 1860's by Mariettte who excavated the temple in 1869 and published the architectural plans and an epigraphic record, albeit very sketchy, of certain parts of the temple decoration. These have proved unreliable at several junctures and cannot be used for present-day analytic study.2 Early in the nineteenth century, Lefebvre examined the decoration of the chapel on the south end of the first court, and provided translations of its inscriptions, as well as rough sketches for the remaining parts of the first pylon.3 In 1935, Wreszinski published photographs and line drawings of the Kadesh battle relief scenes carved on the exterior walls of the temple as part of his pictorial publication of the ancient Egyptian monuments.4 Sadly, several portions of these scenes are now lost. Seele in 1940, followed by Murnane in the 1970s, drew attention to the significance of the use of two forms of prenomens of Ramesses II and the employment of raised and sunk relief in the temple decoration as dating criteria for establishing construction phases.5 In 1962, Arnold in a care ful review of the wall relief scenes identified the uses of several parts of the temple.6 Two fragments from the first hypostyle hall, now in the Walters Art Gallery, were published by Cooney in the 1960s.7 Another fragment from the same hall, now in the Pushkin Museum, has appeared in a publication of its Egyptian reliefs and stelae.8 About a century after Mariette's work at the temple, Kuhlmann spent two field seasons at the temple in 1978 and 1981, and subsequently published two articles discussing certain aspects of the decorative program.9 A few years later, El-Sawi discussed the significance of a scene of the winged djed-pillar in the southwest chapel S.10 1 We would like to thank especially Prof. Peter Brand and Prof. Anthony Spalinger for generously supplying us with photo graphs and information on the forms of Ramesses II's names with a broader geographical scope as well as for some pertinent observations concerning dating and geographical distribution. 2 A.

In 2002 Ullmann discussed the cultic rituals as well as the significance of the chapels within the temple as part of her study of the "Temples of Millions of Years" of the New Kingdom. She believes that there may have been as many as eight constructions of this type built during Ramesses' reign.17 A lengthy chapter in K. Konrad's 2003 book analyzed the decoration of various parts of the temple and their functions.18 In the same year, Maderna-Sieben contributed a study on the lengthy building inscription, connecting the temple's construction with Ramesses II's first trip to Thebes as the independently reigning pharaoh.19 Kuhlmann presented in 2007 an overview of the work of the DAIK at the temple and recapitulated his interpretation of the purpose of its rooms.20 A year later, a more general treatment of the temple with useful color photos was published by Osian.21 Abdelrahiem discussed the decoration in the Osiris sanctuary in 2003 and argued that the granite blocks which lie west of the temple belong to the ceiling of this sanctuary.22 In 2010 and 2012, he produced two articles studying the scenes and inscriptions in Court A.23 More recently, Griffin examined the significance of the depiction of the rekhyt on the sandstone pillars throughout the temple,24 a point that we wish to 11 S.

Finally, El-Shal has studied the inscriptions and scenes of Chapel L/XIII in detail.25 A Short History of the Temple's Purpose and Construction The official name of the Abydos temple of Ramesses II was Hwt-R^-ms-s-s-hnmt-m-Tî-wr "The-Tem ple-of-Ramesses-United-With-the-Thinite-Nome." This name is sometimes replaced by or modified with the term hwt-hhxv-nt-rnpwt, "Temple of Millions of Years," a temple designation that often is ren dered as "funerary temple," although recent studies are apt to prefer the broader (and more accurate) descriptive term, "memorial temple."26 The name of the Abydos temple in the inscriptions is paralleled by a similar "house of millions of years" in Thebes by the name of Hnmt-Wlst, whose construction had probably also already been underway in his first year and mostly finished by Year 21.27 Although the Abydos Temple of Ramesses II lacks any solidly dated inscriptions that would allow one to delineate individual construction stages, it seems almost certain that Ramesses began work on the building either, while he was still crown prince during the latter part of his father's rule, or else he undertook the project early in his rule as sole king. As far as the extensive debate over the nature of rule towards the end of Seti I's reign goes, we have decided to sidestep this thorny issue as much as possible at this point in our publication of the temple. In all likelihood the construction of the temple and its wall decoration carving began at the back of the temple and moved outward towards the front gateway to the east. The carving of the inscriptions started with raised relief in the following areas: court C (second octostyle hall), rooms (or Chapels) J, K, L, Μ, Ε, P, Q, R, S, and F, including the left side of the door thicknesses leading to the court room D. During this phase of decoration, the short prenomen without any epithets— Wsr-mirt-Rr in its various forms—was employed with few exceptions in room D (the main sanctuary of Osiris) (fig. 1: Ί'). Also, the right sides of all the door thicknesses in this part of the temple were most likely not included in this stage, as they were carved in sunk relief. At some point in the later phases of the construction, most likely around the same time as the roofs and the lintels in the chapels were installed, the right hand thicknesses were inscribed. Moving further east beyond the Second Octostyle hall C, this raised relief technique was abandoned in favor of sunk relief which was employed throughout the rest of the temple. It appears that in this stage of the construction and decoration that there were two subsequent phases of sunk relief carv ing. The first phase continued to use the short form of Ramesses's prenomen Wsr-m&gt;rt-Rr in Court B, rooms I, N, G, and J, as well as the right side of all the door thicknesses.28 The workmanship of the sunk-relief carving on the right side of the door thicknesses is evidently inferior to that of the raised relief on the left-side thicknesses (fig. 1: '2'). The door pivots indicate that all the chapel doors swung to the right, and therefore effectively hid the right side of the thicknesses when the doors were open, which may explain their relatively inferior workmanship. The left thicknesses were carved in vertical raised-relief columns employing the short prenomen, and various forms of the nomen in the Rc-ms-s mri-'Imn form. By contrast, the right thicknesses were carved horizontally in sunk relief, employing the short prenomen as well, but now using the Rr-ms-sw-mri-'Imn form of the nomen. 25 Ο.

For some inexplicable rea son, this long prenomen appears in the room D (Osiris sanctuary), which lies in the most inward part of the temple decorated during the first stage employing the short prenomen; perhaps this was a later re-carving of original first-stage decoration (fig. 1: '3'). Kitchen, who calls the temple a memorial temple, believes that the construction began "almost certainly in his last years as prince-regent in the last years of Sethos I."29 He feels that the size of Ramesses' temple is such that it would have taken a total of approxi mately three years to complete its construction and decoration, two years of which would have been done while his father was still alive.30 This reconstruction of the building history seems to require that the project should have been finished by the end of Ramesses' first year of independent rule. Although Kitchen does not explicitly say so, this theory may be based on the forms of the royal name used in the Abydos temple as well as the incomplete state of the work that Ramesses had undertaken to finish in his father's temple nearby. According to this reconstruction of events, two years of the construction would need to take place when Seti I was still alive, presumably while some form of joint rule was in force. Thus, at least as far as when the construction would have begun, Ullmann and Kitchen seem to be in essential agreement. The Kadesh reliefs on the outside walls were prob ably executed roughly at the same time as the other reliefs commemorating the battle, i.e., most likely in the second third of this reign.31 In this connection, it would be interesting to note when (or if) other pha raohs decorated externally visible (i.e., "public") sur faces of temples. There are some supposed Heb-sed chapels at the front of the temple. As with many authors who have discussed this temple, Ullmann does not take these into consideration. She begins her discussion of the temple with the area inside the first court that she calls the "Festhof." Since she is concerned Fig. 1.

Certainly, the Kadesh reliefs were executed no earlier than year 5, most likely after the initial work had been completed. There are other indications that a small fraction of the chapel decorations was probably done at a date later than most of temple. There is a mix of themes that might indicate that the temple and some of its rooms served shifting purposes as would be expected with a temple of this size during a reign as long as that of Ramesses II. Introduction to the Study of the Names of Ramesses II at Abydos In Spalinger's discussion of the early forms of Ramesses II's titulary, he did not note whether its vari ous forms were written vertically or horizontally, but the direction of the writing, as we shall see in the discussions below, had a definite influence of the form of the nomen in particular.33 Whether a text is oriented vertically or horizontally text can have an effect on the manner in which the characters in a word are disposed. Normally, that effect is not particularly significant, but this factor certainly should not be ignored. What we might call a combination of epigraphical and calligraphic considerations might have a subtle influence in how the characters in a text were disposed in relation to each other, especially in royal material. The Abydos temple appears to have represented an experimental stage in Ramesses II's reign when several name forms were tried out before the familiar duo Wsr-M3rt-Rr-stp n-Rc and Rr-ms-sw-mry-'Imn were finally adopted. However, Ramesses was hardly the only monarch to have his name written in a different fashion depending on whether it appeared in a horizontal or verti cal inscription. For example, two familiar examples of such rearrangements occur in the throne names, or prenomens, of Amenhotep III, Tutankhamun and Seti I. In horizontal texts, we encounter: LED ΓΡΊ Whereas in vertical texts, one might encounter such variants as these: ^iii^ z3 (^=©j 32 Ullmann, "Tempel Ramses' II.," 188 and 198, Tab. 4. 33 A. Spalinger, "Early Writing of Ramesses II's Names," 75-89. Note that in the early Gebel el-Silsileh stela, the prenomen in the form Wsr-mlrt-Rc-tit-Rr is accompanied by Rr-ms-s-z-mry-'Imn in the vertical text in the stela top (KRI I, 82, 15), but the simi lar prenomen Wsr-M}rt-R''-iw''w-Rr is followed by Rr-ms-s-sw-mry-'Imn in the main text (KRI I, 90, 10) that is written horizontally. The distinction between horizontal and vertical forms of the cartouches plays a large role in the discussion of the name forms in V. Rondot, La grande Salle Hypostyle de Kamak: Les architraves. Centre franco-égyptien d'étude des temples de Karnak (Paris, 1997). Similar observations can be applied to a more thorough recent discussion of Ramesses's name forms and the manner in which they were employed, see A. Spalinger, "Ramesses II at Luxor: Mental Gymnastics," Or 79 (2010), 425-79. The influence of format—vertical vs. horizontal text—is a much underestimated factor in determining how certain words are written in Egyptian.</page><page sequence="7">GOELET AND ISKANDER 149 A similar type of reordering or rewriting of the elements of a royal name in a cartonche can arise when additional epithets are affixed to the king's name.34 The principle of rearranging, or even re-editing groups of signs to form more visually pleasing, or calligraphic, arrangements is an important one in the writing of inscriptional hieroglyphic texts in par ticular. Some familiar examples are: The subject of calligraphy, if such arrangements can rightly be called by that term, is a much ne glected factor in all types of Egyptian texts, particularly royal inscriptions where the highest quality of work was often at hand. The Forms of Ram esses's Names in the Doorway Inscriptions In the listing below, we shall concentrate only upon the Horus name and the two forms that are enclosed in cartouches—the prenomen and nomen. These are the only components of the live-fold royal titulary that occur on the door jamb inscriptions. For the purposes of showing the effect of inscriptional format—vertical vs. horizontal text—on what we might call (for lack of a better term) the epigraphy of the royal names, we shall deviate from standard practices and transliterate by showin; which letters were employed as phonetic complements after two name components in particular: TIT ms (Siern-list F31). For example, Ramesses's nomen V1 A wsr (Sign-list F12) and TTT ms (Sign-list F31). For example, Ramesses's nomen \1 t,TI ' A (Nl/H below), which would normally be transliterated as Rr-ms-sw-mry-lmn, will be rendered below as Rc-ms s-sw-mry-'Imn. Except in the case of the diagnostic elements wsr and ms, we shall ignore other phonetic complements, such as the n following the mn-sign. In addition, the substitution of different forms of QUID the determinatives of deities as in V aJHTI T (N2/H below) will be treated preferably as separate, rather than variant, forms of the nomen, since these might eventually prove to be the predilections of different sculptor-scribes. Such variants probably do not reflect religious/ideological nuances; it seems more likely that differences of this sort may simply indicate different stages of decoration or different teams of workers. The desire for artistic balance and a pleasing graphical effect most likely played a significant role in the writing of the names—what one might term calligraphic considerations for lack of a better term. In particular, one must bear in mind that in inscribing vertical text, particularly within the narrow confines of a vertically disposed cartouche, space considerations were an important factor in deciding which phonetic complements might be used. In the case of the prenomen, for example, the combination of the vertical prenomens is more space-conservative than ~f P iif that is sometimes found in the horizontal versions. There must have been similar considerations in mind in choosing which phonetic complements followed the ms-sign. 34 P. Brand observed in "[Review of] V. Rondot, La Grande Salle Hypostyle de Karnak: Les Architraves"JEA 88 (2004), 268: ". . . Many of Seti's prenomen cartouches are expanded with additional epithets commonly found on similar architrave texts such as those of Thutmose ITI in the Akh-menu at Karnak.

There is, in fact, an example of the same Golden Falcon name also located in the temple's main Chapel D/XVI, see KRI II 548, 11; Abdelrahiem, "Alabaster Sanctuary of Osiris," 2-3 with fig. 1, where it is supplemented with the additional epithet wrfh1swt "who subdues the foreign lands."

There is, in fact, an example of the same Golden Falcon name also located in the temple's main Chapel D/XVI, see KRI II 548, 11 ; Abdelrahiem, "Alabaster Sanctuary of Osiris," 2-3 with fig. 1, where it is supplemented with the additional epithet wfhiswt "who subdues the foreign lands."

The Importance of Inscriptions in the Chapel Doorways Although nearly every wall on the inside chapel doorways in Ramesses II's Abydos temple bears some manner of inscription, by and large only the left hand texts on the door returns have been recorded and studied, and even these only partially. The more formulaic texts on the right hand sides, by con trast, have been almost universally ignored, most likely because their content has seemed repetitive and far less informative than their counterparts on the left.56 Nevertheless, the inscriptions on both sides deserve closer examination, if for no other reason than the great variation in Ramesses II's titulary that they present. There is a long history in Egyptology of using the form of the royal titulary for dating pur poses in connection with the Ramesside period, particularly with the reign of Ramesses II. 57 Owing to a 55 M. el-Noubi, "The Portico of the Temple of Ramesses II at Abydos," 29, shows N2/H and N5/H paralleling each other on the black granite gateway.

El-Noubi, "The Shrine of Min," 331-41, with pis. 20-25, esp. 332-33. 57 The foundational studies on dating according to the forms of the king's names were done by Seele, The Coregency of Ramses II with Seti I, 45-47 and K.

Given the damaged condition of many chapels, the left hand texts additionally offer other valuable information beyond their application to the temple's construction history; in fact, sometimes they provide important insights into the purpose of a given chapel. To anticipate a later conclusion, we would also like to note at this juncture some peculiarities about the texts on the opposite reveals. It is remarkable that, although the texts on both sides of the doorways each associate the king with numer ous gods, there is sometimes only a weak connection or even a something of a disconnect between the divine repertoire on opposite sides. There are additionally sharp differences in style, coloring, and orientation in the texts of the left and right, which, when considered together, suggest that the right hand texts were inscribed at a somewhat later stage. Finally, in a few instances, the orientation of texts on the left reveals may eventually provide information about the flow of ritual traffic in a chapel. In order to give a fuller picture of the ways in which Ramesses was associated with a variety of deities in the temple, we shall note some select examples where additional lines of titulary appear on the out side framing of the doorway in question. In doing so, it seems best to confine that discussion to those few instances where an inscribed doorway lintel still remains in place or to one instance where a pro cession of geographical personifications has a dedicatory superscript. The reason for these limitations is that these rare cases allow one to see the effect of the inscriptional format—horizontal vs. vertical texts—on the form of the nomen in particular. Remarks on the Construction and Installation of Wooden Doors in Chapels Since the chapel doors were made of wood, it is not surprising that none of the original doors at Abydos have survived. Nevertheless, the layouts of the doorways and their inscriptions provide evidence about how the missing doors appeared, how they operated, and how they were installed.58 A wooden door had an appearance close to the idealized form shown in the hieroglyphic repertoire 1 Γ (Sign-list 031), which represents an unmounted single leaf of a double-leafed door. Sometimes inscriptions will show two door signs rotated and juxtaposed so as to form a doorway Ρ Û such as one might encounter in a large temple ceremonial gateway. The two projections at the top and bottom of the signs represent the hinges, or what might be more accurately described as the hinge pivots that would be inserted into holes at the sides of a stone doorway or into the wooden frame of a shrine. These pivots could be made of wood or metal. In the case of small spaces such as the chapel entrances at the Abydos temple, a single leaf door appears to have sufficed. Since the left hand sides of many chapel doorways have a hole in the wall into which a sliding door bolt fitted and since two chapels still have enough of the ceiling above the doorways preserved to see where the hole for the top end of the hinge pivot was set (fig. 2),59 it is clear that all chapel doors were hinged on the right side- Û - and that and other Ramesside Temples in Nubia,'"JEA 66 (1980), 83-99; idem, "Early Writing of Ramesses II's Names," 75-89; and idem, "Ramesses II at Luxor: Mental Gymnastics," 425-79. 58 The literature on Egyptian doors is rather extensive, so only a few of the more relevant references will be provided here: O.

Restored pivot hole in Chapel I. they swung so that they would cover the right hand side of the door returns when opened. The differ ence in the amount of offset between the inscriptions and the walls offers additional verification for the location of the hinge. Throughout the temple, the offsets between the left hand inscriptions and the adjoining walls were typically in the range of 7-10 cm (fig. 3), whereas the offsets on the right sides ranged from 18-24 cm. The extra space on the right would allow for the thickness of the door when it was swung open on its hinge pivot. The manner in which the hinge posts were inserted into the top and bottom of the doorframe sug gests that it would be unlikely that doors could be installed before the large lintel blocks at the top were ready to be set in place. It would be considerably simpler and more practical to do both operations at the same time. In addition, it would be far easier to decorate the chapels when there was no roof to block sunlight and restrict movements, especially when working on the upper portions of the walls. Since the outside lintels, in turn, were installed along with the rest of the roofing, the back two sections of the temple were completed in three stages, moving from the back towards the front: first, the inner most section around the octostyle Court A, secondly, the middle section around the octostyle Court B, and finally, the area in and around the two octostyle colonnade that faced the sun court, Court A. This supposition is supported not only by its intrinsic practicality, but also by distinct changes in the style of relief decoration, as we hope to demonstrate below. Two actual Egyptian wooden doors can provide us with some valuable information on the appear ance oi the chapel doors at Abydos. The doors—an Old Kingdom example from Saqqara and an early Middle Kingdom wooden door from Deir el-Bahri (MMA 23.3.174)—show how the hinge-pivots were</page><page sequence="15">GOELET AND ISKANDER 157 placed at one side of a single leafed door (figs. 4a, b). We can also see that these doors were strengthened by anchoring vertical planks to gether by horizontal cross bars placed at regu lar intervals. Although it is now missing its hinge-pivots, the second and more informative example is a door (figs. 5a, b) that was part of an Eigh teenth Dynasty shrine at the Deir el-Bahri temple.60 with the painted incised spacers de picted in the inscriptions on the right hand chapel door returns. As with the Middle Kingdom example, several irregularly shaped planks were fitted together along their vertical edges to form a single large rectangular surface. The front surface of the door was decorated with three registers of raised relief carved into the wood. These scenes are what one might typically encounter on a temple wall. More to the point, the back side of the door has the same sorts of several regularly spaced horizontal bar-like planks with a rounded upper surface. The flat bottom sections of these bar-like objects have been affixed across the vertical planks to hold them firmly in place and add strength to the whole unit. These cross bars have a straight edge on one side and are rounded off on the opposite end, which was probably also the side on which the door was hinged, as was the case with the Middle Kingdom exem plar. The arrangement may have provided some protection to the crossbars when the door was opened and the bars came in contact with the part of the wall closest to the hinged side. There is a broken portion at the bottom right of the door's front side, an indication that it was hinged on the right, just as the chapel doors in the Abydos temple were. The spaces between the bars were left undecorated. When we compare the back side of the Deir el-Bahri door with the layout of the inscriptions on the right hand door returns at Abydos, it is obvious that the latter were meant to present an idealization of how the rear surface of the door appeared. It seems doubtful, however, that the horizontal spaces between the bars bore seven to eight lines of titulary incised into the wood. Although these texts were neither as elaborate nor as carefully executed as those on the left hand returns, they nevertheless re quired considerable effort to create—quite remarkable when one considers that the inscriptions would have been invisible when the chapel was not in use and effectively out of sight even once the chapel doors were opened. Recently, this type of doorway decoration was discussed in a paper by Chris Karcher, who has proposed the helpful descriptive term "shadow door"61 (fig. 6). The Royal Names, Purposes, Door Returns, and Decoration of the Rooms In the descriptions below, we have chosen the word "chapel" as a descriptive term, even though it may have been more provident to employ the blander term "room," as Ullmann and Konrad both chose to do.62 For example, according to the texts on the right hand door reveals, Chapel Ρ/VII was apr-mnht "house of mnht-cloth" and Q/VIII was a prn swd!-ntr "house of the god's seal," both terms implying that these spaces served as storage chambers, or the like.

To be accurate, the first three lines in such texts present just what were considered to be the most important elements of the king's titulary—Horus name, prenomen, and nomen—and identify the monarch as "beloved" of a deity. The deity so identi fied in the first column is Inheret, the god to whom the chapel was primarily dedicated, a fact that is reinforced in the fourth, dedicatory column. Coordination of this sort between the first and fourth column is a pattern seen throughout the temple. The signs on the left hand side of the doorway face into the chapel so that the texts are oriented in the canonical direction, but in several other chapels, these columnar texts faced towards the outside of the chapel and therefore had a non-canonical left to-right orientation. In most instances the surviving texts indicate that a divine triad may have presided in each chapel. In each chapel, there was sufficient space on the back shelf and the surrounding areas for several small divine images and their attendant shrines. The fourth column of the left hand inscrip tions is the dedicatory text proper and designates the chief image kept in the chapel or the purpose of the room generally. Finally, at the left of the inscriptional area on the doorjamb there is an important practical feature of all chapel doorways—a large square recess was set into the wall of the jamb and located at a distance approximately a column's width away and halfway up from the floor. This hole was provided in order to receive the end of the sliding bolt when the door was closed. Obviously, the texts on this left side would be visible when the door was opened, whereas those on the right return would be covered. The first three columns on the right each begin with a different form of the Horus name (R—&gt;L): (1) Hrw ki-nht mry-M3rt (Hl/V) nswt-bity Wsr-Mîct-Rr (PI/V) z3-Rc Rr-ms-s-z-mry-Imn (Nl/V) mry Ίη-hrt; (2) Hi~w ki-nht mki Kmt (H2/V) nswt-bity Wsr-M&gt;ct-Rr (Pl/V) z&gt;-Rr Rc-ms-s-z-mry-'Imn (Nl/V) mry Mht; (3) Hrw ki-nht wsr-rnpwt (H3/V) nswt-bity Wsr-Mirt-Rc (Pl/V) zi-Rr Rr-ms-s-z-mry-Imn (Nl/V) mry Gbb.

The names given the chapels in this paper are normally based on similar texts that appear in the fourth col umn. This column is the most certainly one of the most important in the chapels where it is preserved, since the text describes the name of the deity or deities for whom the king had made a shrine, statue, or had performed some other benefaction—in short, the purpose of the chapel in question. Extending across the bottom of all four columns, but separated by the column lines, is the phrase di rnh dd wis mi Rr dt "Given life, stability, and dominion like Re (for) everlasting sameness."66 This tag phrase or a close variant of it appears at the bottom of all the columnar dedicatory inscriptions. In several instances, such wishes are shorter and extend for only the first three columns. Right. As with all other right hand doorway texts in the temple, the inscriptions on these returns were recorded neither by Mariette, nor by Kitchen. On the door returns on right side, Karcher's "shadow door,"67 there are seven rows of unpainted and incised horizontal texts, facing inwards; a small number of other chapels have eight lines of text instead. In this particular chapel, the texts show no trace of color, whereas in several other chapels they are in monochrome red ochre. The texts on the right hand side, while well-done, are seldom as high quality or informative as those on the left hand. This disparity in quality was probably because these texts would be obscured when the door was opened. Other factors, such as the possibility that these latter inscriptions were executed at a later date than the much finer texts on the left hand sides of the doorways doubdessly had an influence on the choice of names as well. Although one could describe the right hand texts as being monochrome, that term is not strictly accurate, since the dividing space bars were normally painted blue or blue-green in several of the other chapels. The square ends of the spacing bars are aligned with the beginning of the text lines; the rounded ends are aligned with their ends. In a few instances, either the right hand texts were un painted or else all traces have disappeared. The right hand inscriptions have a pattern that displays alternating rows of titulary—the prenomen line, space bar, then the nomen line—each of the names accompanied by the expression mry DN "be loved of" a deity. Often, the gods so named are important, but in a few chapels rather obscure deities are named as protectors. Many of the deities that appear in the right hand inscriptions have a weak or no immediate connection with those named in the vertical texts on the opposite thickness. Of course, such judgments have to be made as well on the basis what is currendy preserved in the main scenes and texts in the chapels. Straddling every two lines and separated by the dividing bar there is normally the expression di rnh mi Rr "given life like Re." In each row where the prenomen appears, it is introduced alternately with ntr nfr nb tiwy "the Perfect God, Lord of the Two Lands" or ntr nfr nb irt ht "the Perfect God, Lord of Doing Things," i.e., perform ing rituals. Unlike the texts on the left hand side, the royal epithet nswt bity was never employed in the horizontal inscriptions in this or any other chapels. The introductory epithets that appear between ntr nfr and the cartouches may sometimes vary in other chapels, but never in a significant manner. The lines presenting the nomen normally begin with the phrase zi Rr nb hrw "the Son of Re, Lord of Ap pearances." In all but one case, the right hand texts employ the prenomen in its Pl/H form while the nomen has the Nl/H form.68 A three-line example of the typical arrangement of horizontal inscrip tions appears below, which additionally allows us to see how the epithet di cnh mi Rr normally fit into 66 This type of arrangement is what Kitchen calls a "crossword tag," see RITANCII 373, §707. 67 See above, p. 191. 68 For other instances where Ramesses II used alternating names as part of decorative schemes, see e.g., Spalinger, "Ramesses II at Luxor: Mental Gymnastics," 425-79.</page><page sequence="22">164 JARCE 48 (2012) the entire inscription.

Since this short "crossword" phase must straddle two lines of inscription, the ideal arrangement on the right side of the doorways may have required an even number of lines, although an extra di rnh might stand by itself. The deities named in these right hand inscriptions in their entirety are: (1) Wsir nb nhh "Osiris, Lord of Everlasting Change"; (2) In-hrt-Sw z&gt; Rc "Inheret-Shu, son of Re"; (3) Mht zit-Rr "Mehit, daughter of Re"; 69 (4) //rw-nçi-/ii./"Horus-Avenger-of-his-Father"; (5) 1st wrt "Isis the Great"; (6) 'Inpw imv wt "Anubis, who is in the place of embalming"; (7) Wp-w&gt;wt hrp nswt thvy "Wepwawet, the controller and king of the Two Lands." Unlike many other chapels in the temple, Chapel I/VI exhibits a close relationship between the deities mentioned on the left and right hand inscriptions that appear inside the chamber. The three chief deities on both sides of the doorway are: Inheret, whose statue was maintained in the chapel, Osiris, and Mehit. Design Considerations in the Texts. An important feature of the dedicatory inscriptions in all chapels is a desire to lay out the texts in such a manner that the elements of the royal name—Horus name, Prenomen, and Nomen will be aligned in the parallel lines whether the text was oriented vertically or horizontally. This type of alignment, somewhat like "justification" in modern typesetting is unfortu nately difficult to convey due to the limitations of computer-generated or typeset hieroglyphs. Careful attention to the calligraphic effect in presenting titulary is hardly confined to this temple or to the monuments of this monarch. In fact, such arrangements are such common features of Egyptian royal inscriptions that they are easily overlooked and hardly, if ever, mentioned in Egyptological literature yet such design considerations probably played a most significant role in the decoration of temples and stelae in all periods of Egyptian history. Court A (Portico) Chapels Chapels O/I, N/II, G/III, and H/IV form a group on the temple's first terrace, which can be accessed by the central staircase from Court A.70 They are all oriented on the East-West axis of the temple itself. These chapels could also be accessed by two smaller staircases situated at the north and south edges 'I I I GIMDIlPo,© 69 Although this goddess is normally styled as the consort of Inheret, she is known to have the epithet zit Rc at Sebnnytos as well, see L.

All four chapels lacked inscriptions on the right hand door returns, a feature not found in the chapels off the two inner Courts Β and C. However, there are traces of horizontal or vertical guidelines on the right hand surfaces, by which we can safely infer that the original intention was to inscribe the doorways in the same fashion as the chapels leading off the inner Courts A and B. The most likely explanation for the change in plans would simply be a desire to finish the temple quickly. The right hand inscriptions, after all, would be concealed once the doors were opened and would have minimal exposure. Chapel 0/In Deified Seti I, his cult barque, and the royal ancestors.72 Left. The inscriptions present the standard four-column text in incised polychrome hieroglyphs; the signs face into the chapel in the canonical direction. The beginning portion of each column is missing, so that only the epithet stp-n-Rr of the prenomen [Wsr-z-M?rt-Rc]-stp-n-Rr (P3/V) is preserved. This form of the prenomen has been partially restored on the basis of the titulary in the adjoining Chapel N. It is significant that the standard epithet stp-n-Rr has now been appended to the name. In these vertical inscriptions, however, the prenomen is still not written with the final sw. The varying titularies, the as sociated gods, and the dedicatory line are: (1) . . .

Right. As in all the chapels that are in this section of the temple, the right side of the doorway was left uninscribed. Although we have primarily been describing chapel doorways in this article, other texts in Chapel Ο contain some significant variations of Ramesses II's name. This chapel was dedicated to the cult of the royal ancestors that now included the king's deceased father, Seti I. In fact, this is the sole place within the temple where Seti's name was explicitly mentioned. It was only fitting that the north wall of this chapel should have originally contained a king list closely modeled on the more famous one in the so called Hall of Kings of Seti's nearby temple. Seti appears as the next-to-last member of a theoretically unbroken string of royal ancestors that culminates with the living Ramesses himself, thus confirming his legitimacy and that of the Ramesside dynasty. This lengthy table, formatted almost like an accounts papyrus, was carefully executed in polychrome sunk relief.

At the end of the table of kings, there is a heavily damaged dedicatory text in two columns. Several blocks with the Chapel Ο list were removed to the British Museum (BM EA 117) in the early Nineteenth Century; some fragments of the text are still in situ,74 Although Ramesses' list is damaged, the missing portions can be restored confidently based on Seti's version.75 According to Kitchen's restoration, there were thirty-eight columns, each containing the prenomens of two different kings in the following pattern in alternating columns. Ramesses name, either as a pre nomen or a nomen, concludes each column as the dedicatory monarch: (eve„columns)l(Mr®)?i^^!lGEDV^=f-, IGEDVoi — This pattern, however, is not without its exceptions. Within the tabular king list itself, the the pre nomen is consistently written Wsr-M3rt-Rr-stp-n-Rr (P4/V), but occurs once in the Wsr-z-Mlct-Rr (Pl/V) form in the dedicatory portion. Three forms of the nomen are used in the king list. Most examples appear as above Rr-ms-s-mry-'Imn (Nl/V). The nomen Rr-ms-s-sw-mry-'Imn three times, in two differ ent forms, once with the anthropomorphic Re (N3A/V) and twice using the N5 sign (N2B/V). All the cartouches in the king list table are approximately the same size, including those of Ramesses below and in the adjacent dedicatory text. In several instances, some adjustments were necessary—none of the prenomens of the kings of the past, however, include any epithetical elements such as mry + divine name or hk&gt; Wist that were often present in their names in contemporary texts. One might say that considerations of design trumped strict accuracy. Chapel NUI76 Cult of the Royal Ancestors.77 Left. The inscriptions were executed in sunk polychrome relief and face into the chapel; the paint is now rather faint or missing. Only the bottom portion of the four columns of text has been preserved.

Chapel HIIV81 Offering room for the cult statue of Ramesses II82 The original and main purpose of this chapel apparently was to serve as the repository for the cult statue of the king. However, the presence of some inscriptional additions, placed uniquely for this temple on the lower registers—the Litany of Re as well as portions of Book of the Dead Chapters 144,83 146, and 148—show that the purpose of this room may have been later modified to serve the afterlife cult of Ramesses. This supposition is confirmed by the fact that these texts on the lower regis ters of the room contain three instances where the name of Ramesses is preceded by the epithet Wsir "Osiris,"84 implying that at some point the post-mortem aspect of the king was being served in this chapel. In fact, this is the sole chapel in the temple where the king is addressed as "Osiris." The text of the Litany also preserves the sole examples of the Rr-ms-z-z-mry-'Imn form (N4/V) of the nomen in the temple, yet another indication that the texts in the lower registers were executed at a later date.

Court Β (First Octostyle Hall) Chapels Except for the monumental gateways along the temple's main axis, the only decorated doorways leading off Court Β were at Chapel I at the north and the narrower doorway that led to the staircase at the south. Due to the staircase, this court thus is only court that does not have an entirely symmetrical arrangement. The pattern of the inscriptions in this section of the temple appears to have been the same as encountered in the previous group of chapels off of the platform leading up from court A. Chapel I/VI For a complete description, see above at the beginning of this section of this article. The texts in this chapel, their placement, and orientation have been used as the model for the discussion of the doorway texts in the other temple chapels. The Staircase Inscription on the South of Court Β Although the focus of this article has been on the doorway inscriptions associated with the temple chapels, we would like to present a previously unpublished inscription that appears on the right hand (notional west) wall of the staircase that led from the south side of Court Β up to the roof of the temple.86 This fragmentary text indicates that the roof of this section of the temple served a previously unrecognized purpose and possibly reveals an important religious practice within the temple as a whole. The staircase stands opposite Chapel I and is one of the few asymmetrical features of the temple. Kuhl mann has proposed that the location of the staircase—directly opposite Chapel I (the Onuris Chapel would link it functionally to that room. He has further proposed that the staircase might have been used for transporting a cult statue of Onuris's consort Mehit from this room to the roof of the temple.87 This suggestion seems unlikely since the remains of the staircase text mentions only a barque dedicated to Ramesses and invokes a deity by the pronoun "he," almost certainly referring to Re. 85 On this point, see above in the description of the P2/V form of the prenomen. 86 pYj VI, 37, 'V'; this text was not recorded by either Mariette or Kitchen. 87 Kuhlmann, "Der Tempel Ramses II. in Abydos.

May he put/give (down) his rays88 so that they might be bright upon his processional barque, (namely that of) Ramesses-beloved-of-Amun, like Re."89 The staircase is rather narrow, leading one to wonder what sorts of images or barques might have been carried periodically up to the roof in order to revitalize them by exposure to direct sunlight. Un less the object was rather small, it seems unlikely that the rather complex determinative of the noun ssw-approximately (Sign-list P41A)-is an accurate representation of what actually could be transported on these stairs. More likely, just a small cult figurine was removed from the shrine on the barcjue for such purposes. The loss of the beginning portions of the text is particularly unfortunate, since these tantalizing remains mention petitions to the deities by non-elite humanity as a whole (rmtw). It would be quite in teresting to know in what manner such petitioning might be related to a frequent motif on columns in all three courts. A large proportion of the temple's square columns depict various personifications of the gods and humanity in a prayerful posture, usually accompanied by some variation of the familiar logographic group V y dwi rhyt nb, "the common people worship the lord," that L. Bell has discussed at length.90 The columns depict personifications of ntrw "gods," prt "patricians," rmtw "people," rhyt "commoners," and hnmmt "the sun-folk," all depicted in a similar kneeling posture with hands upraised in praise. The significance of where this logographic phrase appears in the temple is a rather complex problem that we hope to raise in a later article, yet the logogram and the staircase text together indi cate that provisions were made to allow some of the non-elite populace to enter parts of the temple on occasion and to petition the deities. Nevertheless, it seems improbable that the common people could 88 The choice of the word miwt "die Strahlen der Sonne, ihr Glanz," Wb. 2, 28, 1-4, is remarkable since it probably involves a play on words that is quite appropriate in the context of rooftop ritual, wherein the exposure of the cult statue to the sun's rays would make the statue new—miw. 89 The word ntrw is actually a single hieroglyph consisting three overlapping A40 signs.

There is a small section of inscription preserved on the opposite east wall, containing only the tem ple's name written in cryptographic manner.91 This fragmentary text offers no additional insights into the purpose of the staircase. The texts on the jambs on the outside of the doorway to the staircase are likewise in poor condition, preserving only the bottom portion where the names of deities who love the king appear. There is nothing out of the ordinary in these inscriptions, except that one column on the left jamb mentions Sokar as a divine patron, one of the few times that this important funerary deity appears in the surviving texts and scenes in the temple. Court C (Second Octostyle Hall) Flanking Chapels The chapels that were situated along the sides of Court C can be divided into three separate groups: (1) This first group is formed by Chapels P, Q, R, J, K, and L, insofar as these six rooms are the same size and flank Court C at its north and south sides; (2) Chapels M and S are the largest in the temple. They each had two columns and nine small cult niches. Both chapels were accessible only through doors on the west walls of chapels L and R respectively; (3) Chapels F, D, and Ε were the main cult chapels in the temple, since they were directly at the western end of temple's east-west axis. They were thus located at the end of the processional route at the back of the temple. Chapel P/VII92 Left. The left hand vertical texts are in polychrome raised relief, as were the scenes inside the chapel. Judging from the position of the dedication text in the fourth column as well as the remains of the squarish hole provided for the door-bolt on the left, these texts had a non-canonical orientation, so that the texts faced outwards from chapel, as do all the other doorway texts on the south side of this court, on both right hand and left hand thicknesses. Four columns of text are preserved, but the first two are heavily damaged, so that only the last two of the Horus names remain: and Wsr MVt (Hl/V). The prenomen is Wsr-z-MFt-FC (Pl/V), preceeded by nb tiwy; the nomen is preceded by ζj Rr η ht.f nb hrw and has the Rr-ms-s-z-mry-'Imn (N1/V) form. The gods who love the king in the first three columns are: (1) 'Imn; (2) Hrw; (3) inpw. The gods' names are presented without determinatives; the usual transcolumnar inscription along the bottom was not included.

The right hand horizontal texts are incised and only faint traces of paint are preserved; the en tirety is badly preserved with one portion mounted on top of a raised cement block; just three lines of text remain.

Court C Rear Chapels The five chapels along the back of the temple—Chapels S, F, D, E, and M at the temple's notional west end—should be considered as two related groups of chapels; the relationship, however, is indirect and somewhat weak. The two large chapels—Chapels M and S at the north- and south-west corners of the temple—form a special sub-group and were the destination for the statues of the temple's two enneads who are probably to be identified with the psdt(y)-np~w η Hrw imyw.f mentioned in the fourth dedicatory column in the left-hand inscriptions of Chapel L. Significantly, Chapels M and S could be accessed only by doorways on the west wall of Chapels R and L; thus, M and S are really an intermedi ary sub-group: on one hand, these two chapels, like the three central chapels along the temple's west end, were independent terminal points for processional rituals, and separated from the central chapels for the Abydene divine triad—Osiris (Chapel D), Isis (Chapel E), and Horus (Chapel F); on the other hand, Chapels M and S could only be accessed through the flanking Chapels R and L. Subgroup 1 - The two large chapels, Chapels M and S, respectively at the SW and NW corners of the temple. Chapels M and S apparently served as the focus of worship for a different ennead, as discussed above. Unfortunately, the decorations and inscriptions of many of the small insets provided for the cult statues are too damaged to tell much about the composition of the ennead, particularly those in Chapel S. Most likely these enneads were the same gods mentioned in the dedicatory inscription on the left side of Chapel L, where the king is credited with building pr psdt(y)-np~w η Hr imyw.f "λ house (i.e., chapel) for the two Divine Enneads of Horus, who are in him."

Zweiter Bericht," 360, n. 13. The writing is peculiar, but contra Konrad and Kuhlmann, since there are two symmetrical Enniad chapels, it seems more likely that the two divine determinatives refer to the wordpsdt-ntrw "ennead of gods," rather than to the god Horus, who does not appear to receive the seated-deity determinative (Sign-list A40) elsewhere in the temple. This consistency in the use of determinatives has led me to suggest instead the transliteration psdt(y)-ntrw. The sequence of the hieroglyphs as they appear in El-Shal, "La chapelle d'Osiris," 341, is incorrectly rendered and leads her interpretation of the text astray. 109 PM VI&gt; 38 (69). n° PM VI, 37.</page><page sequence="33">GOELET AND ISKANDER 175 Chapel F/XV1U Horus112 The texts in this chapel were not recorded in KRI. Left. Chapel F and Chapel E are both distinguished from most of the other chapels in the temple by having a speech introduced by a deity or the king instead of the usual presentation of titular elements in vertical columns. In this case, the king is depicted wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt as be fits a text on a chapel's southern wall; he faces into the chapel; a sun-disk with two uraei and &amp;?-signs is above him (Sign-list N6C). Most of his face is now missing, perhaps due to deliberate damage. His right arm and hand are raised in invocation, while his left hand holds a brachiomorphic censer that extends into the leftmost column of his speech. The signs are in raised polychrome relief that face into the chapel in the same direction of the king. It is uncertain how many columns the whole speech originally comprised, but at present only three columns are preserved, the last consisting of the short extra-columnar phrase ir.fdi rnh underneath the censer. Above the king are two columns of identifying titulary followed by di rnh: ntr nfr t¥sr-z-M3rt-Rc (P1 /V); zl Rc Rr-ms-s-z-mry-'Imn (Nl/V); di cnh.

Right. On the right door return only two lines of incised monochrome inscriptions survive. As in all other chapels, these right hand texts are oriented so as to face into the chapel. The remaining two lines are adjacent and follow the alternating pattern encountered in other door return inscriptions: (x +1) np- nfr Wsr-mlrt-Rr (Pl/H) mry Dhwty wdr Mft "perfect god Usermaatre, beloved of Thoth who decides Justice." The name of the goddess Mlrt has the C10A determinative here although the word is clearly intended as the personification of divine order and universal justice, rather than as a deity in the normal sense of the word; (x + 2) zl Rr Rr-ms-s-sw-mry-1mn (N2/H) mry 'Inpw nb ti dsr "son of Re Ramesses, beloved of Amun, beloved of Anubis, Lord of the Sacred Land."

The importance of Chapel D is signaled by its inscriptions and its dedication to the cult of the chief deity of the Abydene nome, to be sure, but even more by its location at the center of the temple's back wall. To these we can add yet another indication that this was the key sanctuary of the entire temple—unlike any other room in the temple, Chapel D's walls were lined with fine limestone that was decorated in raised relief of the highest quality.114 This work was proudly mentioned by Ramesses II in the temple's large building inscription with special emphasis on the materials used.115 In all probability Chapel D was designed and built in the earliest stages of construction. Perhaps this choice of materials was influenced by the use of similar materials in the completion of his father's more famous temple nearby. In light of these features, it is particularly regrettable that virtually none of the original inscriptional material on the door returns is preserved. However, an extensive amount of the original wall reliefs inside the chapel itself have survived. Depart ing from the normal practice in this article to concentrate mostly on inscriptions of the door inscrip tions, we would like to note an interesting aspect of the texts in the room. Enough remains on the double false door on the back (west) wall of the chapel116 to see that they presented two identical images, back-to-back, of Ramesses embracing the image of the mummiform Osiris who stands on a small platform in the shape of one of the signs for m ft &gt;—ι (Sign-list AA11).117 To the back of both scenes and situated at the very center of the entire scene are two vertical text bands containing the king's titulary, oriented so that the signs confront each other. The king's cartouches are in the usual form normally encountered on the left hand side of the door returns elsewhere in the temple, i.e., Wsr-z-m3rt-Rr (Pl/V) for the prenomen and Rr-ms-s-z-mty-'Imn (Nl/V) for the nomen. Yet, in the horizontal bandeau text at the bottom of the scene on the right (north) wall,118 the cartouches are respectively Wsr-M'rt-Rr-stp-n-Rr (P4/H) and Rc-ms-s-sw-mry-'Imn (N2/H). Following the pattern encoun tered repeatedly in the texts on door returns throughout the rest of the temple, the nomen assumes a different form depending on whether it is oriented vertically or horizontally. Even though these scenes were all executed within a very short time of each other, the complementation of the /ns-sign (Sign-list F31) differs according to the text format even at this early stage. The distinction between the two name forms appears to have been motivated by practical, rather than ideological factors. Chapel E/XVII119 Isis The texts in this chapel were not recorded in KRI. This and the other chapel (Chapel F) flanking the central Osiris chapel (Chapel D) are hardly mentioned at all in Konrad.120 Both Chapel Ε and F are 113 PM VI, 38 and KRIII, 548, 9-16. 114 For an extensive description of Chapel D's decoration and inscriptions, see M. Abdelrahiem, "The Inscriptions of the Ala baster Sanctuary," 1-10, with pis. 1-5. Some of the chapel's religious and ideological aspects are discussed in Konrad, Architektur und Theologie, 266-69 and Ullmann, "Tempel Ramses' II.," 320-21. 115 Abdelrahiem, "The Inscriptions of the Alabaster Sanctuary," 1, states that this chapel is mentioned in "Bandeau Text I" which accompanies the Festival Calendar on the temple's south wall, see KRI II, 514, 9-11. However, despite the mention of alabaster, the description seems to apply not to this one chapel alone, but to the temple overall, see Kitchen, RITA II 239; idem, RITANCII, 360-61. 116 For this type of false door and its connection with royal religious ideology, see M.

Left. As in the case of Chapel F that adjoins the other side of the central Chapel D, Chapel Ε has an invocatory inscription instead of the usual four column text on the left door return. This text presents a nearly complete inscription that extends over seven columns. The first two columns are long and ap pear in front of Thoth, who delivers the speech; the five remaining columns are short and appear over his head. In this instance, Thoth faces rightwards into the chapel; he has his right arm and hand raised in an invocatory gesture; his left hand holds a rolled papyrus. The text is executed in polychrome raised relief oriented in the same direction as the deity faces and has been adjusted to fit around his figure, which the result that the final columns are rather short. A portion approximately one group in size is missing from ihe top of each column, except for the first. The text in front and over the deity reads: θ£· (aim PU1I.4) PUIp, (1) dd-mdw in Dhwty nb mdw-np" zi.k m rh.k η cnh dd wis . . . t wrt (2) . . . snt.k ir.n n.k zi.k mr n.k nb tiwy Wsr-z-mirt-Rr m hwt Rr-ms-s-z-mry-'Imn hnmt Ti-wr shr Dhwty (3) [hf]tyw.k &lt;m&gt; hrt-hrw (4) . . . ww sbi(w) (5) kiri sps (6) . . .

Although one would assume that Thoth's speech would be addressed to Isis, who is ostensibly the chief deity of the chapel, this text repeatedly employs the masculine second person singular suffix pronoun, and mentions "your (m.) sister," so that Thoth's speech may have instead been directed to Osiris or to the king as the presiding priest. Right. There are seven lines of horizontal inscriptions on the right side door return. The text is rather fragmentary; most of the first three lines of text are lost. The inscriptions are done in incised monochrome hieroglyphs that face inward into the chapel. From what remains, it seems that the pre nomen and nomen occur in the normal alternating pattern, with the standard wish straddling every two lines: di cnh mi Rr dt. The prenomen is the usual Wsr-s-Mirt-Rr (Pl/H), preceded by np- nfr nb tiwy. Unlike the case for nearly every other group of horizontal right hand return inscriptions, in the two places where it is preserved, the nomen has the form Rc-ms-s-z-mry-'Imn (N4/H), preceded by zi Rr nb hrw.

None of the deities have a divine determina tive following the name. Once again, it is odd that Isis, who is not mentioned until the fourth line of these dedicatory texts, is not given a more prominent role on right side of the doorway. Vertical and Horizontal Name Forms on the North West Wall of Court A (Portico) A clear pattern emerged in the presentation of the royal nomen from our discussion of door returns above. In texts written in a columnar format such as those on the left hand door thicknesses, the no men was nearly always written RS-ms-s-z-mry-Imn. By contrast, in the linear formatted texts on the right hand thicknesses, the nomen was consistently written Rr-ms-s-sw. Although it is conceivable that there were ideological factors involved, it seems much more likely that the choice between name forms was made simply on the basis of text format. In three other instances where the lintels on the outside of chapel doorways were preserved, if one compares the inscriptions on the lintels with those on the side door jambs, the same distinction between the name forms in the vertical and horizontal texts prevailed. Even though the right hand inscriptions often appear to be thematically loosely coordinated with the more elaborate texts on the left hand returns and, indeed, appear almost as if they were inscribed as an afterthought, it nevertheless remains improbable that much time passed between the two sets of inscriptions. Despite this reasonable assumption, it would still be welcome to find confirmation that the stages of decoration (and construction) followed each other fairly quickly. The decoration and in scriptions in this, the front part of the temple, in fact, provide conclusive proof that both forms of the nomen were already in use together during the early part of the reign. On Court A's portico platform, just outside the monumental gateway leading into Court Β there is a procession of personified phw "marshes, fens" in the form of "fecundity figures" bearing offerings for the king. There appears to have been a corresponding procession, perhaps consisting of nomes instead of phw, on the wall at the southern side of the gateway, but this has been largely destroyed. The scene begins on the walls at the right side of the monumental granite doorway leading into the court and extends almost to the point where this wall joins with the northern wall of Court A; the phw of Upper and Lower Egypt were represented together. The horizontal inscription is interrupted by the doorway to Chapel G and continues on the wall between it and Chapel H. Along the top of this line of figures there is a bandeau-like text in large, deeply incised hieroglyphs that effectively forms the descriptive label for the procession below.121 Except for some damage at its beginning, this inscription is well preserved. The procession of offering bearers walks in a row towards the left as if they were moving towards the gate entrance (fig. 7). The main text above them is oriented in the same direction as the procession and records a speech of these offering bearers, who say that they are coming to present gifts to the king. We present below only the sections with the king's pre nomen and nomen:122 q~ w m in ... η nswt-bity nb tlwy Wsr-M !rt-Rr-stp-n-Rr z!-Rr Rr-ms-s-sw-mry-Imn di cnh ii.n "... to the Dual king, Lord of the Two Lands, Usermaatre-the-one-whom-Re-chose (P4/H), son of Re, Ramessess-beloved-of-Amun y\ i i i 121 KRI537, 14-538, 1. 122 PM VI, 35 (20-21).

These texts are also re corded in el-Noubi, "The Portico of the Temple of Ramesses II," 32-34, with the royal names correcdy recorded, but with minor errors elsewhere. For a description of similar lists of phw, see P. Barguet, "Une liste des pehou d'Egypte sur un sarcophage du Musée du Louvre," Kêmi 16 (1962), 8-20, esp. the tables on 13-17. Oddly enough for a royal inscription, Ramesses II's version appears to diverge from a standard order of the phw. The similar geographical procession (PM VI, 35, 17-18) at the opposite, south side of the gateway has been largely destroyed.</page><page sequence="37">GOELET AND ISKANDER 179 (N2/H) given life. We come. . . Although the computer-generated hieroglyphs used above do not show it, both cartouches are approximately the same length.

However, unlike the situation with the door return texts, where an unknown interval might conceivably have elapsed between the decoration of the right and left hand sides of the doorways, there can be no question that both the vertical and horizontal texts for this geographical procession were inscribed at the same time—one text would have little mean ing without the other. The concluding portion of the large horizontal descriptive inscription appears on the wall between Chapels G and H. Here the king's titulary appears once more in the phrase: . . . jr58 VJ3F1 ' AlA I I &amp;. . . m dfiw n Rcnb zi RrRc-ms-s-sw-mry-'Imn di cnh mi Rr ". . . as the daily provisioning (of) the son of Re Ramesses-beloved-of-Amun (N2/H), given life like Re."

Balanced Presentation of Cartouches The appearance of the nomen and prenomen directly adjacent to each other in a vertical or a hori zontal text, such as in the example outside of Chapel G just discussed above, is not often encountered in this temple. When such a presentation occurred, particularly in texts where offerings associated with the king were listed in a tabular form, there was a need to have the two cartouches equal in size. An example of such a tabular list with Ramesses' names, would be the lower section of the British Museum Abydos king-list that once stood on the north wall of Chapel O/1.123 From a strictly graphical viewpoint, there was an immediate problem in creating an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. 123 See η. 71.

He and his director of sculptors appear to have been similarly influenced by such design considerations as the "balancing" of cartouche sizes. Notably, the shift in name forms between Rr-ms-s-s and Rr-ms-s-sw at Medinet Habu occasionally occurs on opposite sides of doorways under circumstances remarkably similar to what prevailed in the chapel doorways of Ramesses II's Abydos temple.124 The "Walking wsr" Sign This idiosyncratic sign (fig. 9),125 which is likely the work of a single artist or team of sculptor-scribes wherever it appears, occurs three times in the temple, each time as part of the Wsr-MFt-Rr prenomen. It occurs in Chapel S/X, in Chapel K/XII, and Chapel G/III—indicating a rough progression of work in the temple. This odd variant sign appears as well in the nearby Osiris temple as part of Seti's Golden 124 For example, see Medinet Habu IV, pi. 240, which records the texts and scenes on both sides of a doorway. Significantly, this doorway was decorated with the same form of horizontal inscriptions in which the botten bars were interspersed with lines of titulary. These texts likewise appear on the right hand side that would be concealed when the door was opened. For two other examples of this arrangement in doorways at Medinet Habu, see e.g., MHIV, pi. 237A and 240. In all likelihood, these examples could be multiplied here. 125 Listed as an occasional variant of the standard wsr-sign (Sign-list F12) in Wb.

It would be interesting to see whether this odd glyph occurs in both versions. This form of the Golden Falcon name appears in von Beckerath, Handbuch as Gib in Seti's titularies. However, Gla, another variant of the same Golden Falcon name, does not use this odd sign. Peter Brand has supplied us with a few examples of the sign from the Theban region, in particular in the hypostyle hall at Gurnah, a vestibule at Gurnah; and Gurnah, vestibule 3. The Possibility of an Osireion The origin of several scattered red granite blocks that now lie on the sand outside the temple's west wall as well as some similar blocks on the floor of Court C have raised questions as to whether Ram esses may have constructed an Osireion similar to the one that lies to the north of his father's temple. Beckerath alluded cautiously to the prospect that these blocks may belong to a monument directly west of the temple, a counterpart to that of the temple of Seti 1.127 Support for this view has been provided by an unpublished ground penetrating radar survey conducted west of the temple under auspices of the University of Pennsylvanian in January 1992. This survey clearly revealed the existence of a size able underground structure there approximately 30 χ 30 meters in size.128 However, Kuhlmann,129 Abdelrahiem,130 and Konrad have instead asserted that these blocks are more apt to be ceiling blocks belonging to the temple proper, probably originally forming part of the roof of the central Chapel D. Remarks on Ramesses II's Name Form as a Dating Criterion In the initial part of this article, we presented a short sketch of the temple's construction history based on a combination of three main factors: the location of the various forms of Ramesses II's no men and prenomen; the apparent progression of construction from the back of the temple at Court A to the front at Court C; and the shift from raised to sunk relief. The most inconsistent of these three elements are the royal names, which, as the extensive discussion of their usage shows, resist all attempts to fit them into a convincing developmental pattern. However, since the construction of the temple and most of its decoration took place over a relatively short period of no more than four to five years, the location of the various name forms within the temple can provide a reasonably good approximation of a developmental sequence. At the same time, the wide variety of name forms and relief styles both at this temple and other monuments of his reign leaves one with the impression that Ramesses II may well have been encouraging experimentation to aid him decide how he wished to have his monuments decorated.131 These estimates of the times when aspects of the decoration were adopted naturally entail a degree of uncertainty. Yet, since the construction appears to have proceeded at a steady rate from back to front during a short period of time, there are probably less variables in 126 KRlll, 193, 14. 127 For an illustration, see Kuhlmann, "Der Tempel Ramses II. in Abydos," 194, pi. 57. J. Beckerath, "Abydos," I A A 1, 39, sug gested that whether these granite blocks were part of a counterpart to Seti's Osireion was an open question that was yet to be in vestigated. Abdelrahiem, however, pointed out that the blocks outside the temple had originally been found inside the temple and were transported outside, see "The Inscriptions of the Alabaster Sanctuary," 5 with pi. 4, which shows the blocks in situ in 1914. 128 We are grateful to James Westerman for making this survey available to us. 129 Kuhlmann, "Vergangenheit," 218, with n. 3. 130 Abdelrahiem, "The Inscriptions of the Alabaster Sanctuary," 5-6, with pi. 4. 131 These observations are in part based on several instructive photographs from other sites where Ramesses II was active in the early part of his reign, particularly in the Theban region. Once again, I would like to thank Peter Brand for his generosity in sharing and discussing these with us. These illustrations are part of a larger work in progress that he is producing on the innova tive character visible in many aspects of Ramesses II's kingship.</page><page sequence="41">GOELET AND ISKANDER 183 volved within this one structure than comparisons one might make over a much wider geographical area and involving much larger temples, such as those at Thebes and Nubia. Most importantly, we can say with some certainty that by the time nearly all of decoration inside the temple proper had been completed, Ramesses II had already settled on the combination of prenomen and nomen that were to be the standards for the rest of his reign —Wsr-mVt-Rr-stp-n-Rc for both hori zontal and vertical formats, whereas the nomen could appear either as Rr-ms-(s)-sw-mry-Imn or some variant of Rr-ms-s-z/s-mry-Imn depending on whether a horizontal or vertical format was chosen. Since the nomen Rr-ms-(s)-sw-mty-'Imn was definitely in use here at the very earliest stages of construction, the evidence from this temple should certainly serve as a cautionary note for those wishing to rely too strictly on that name form as a reliable dating criterion elsewhere.
