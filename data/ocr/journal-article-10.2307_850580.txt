<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALYSIS: THE HERDING OF SACRED COWS? Marcia Herndon INTRODUCTION n the relatively brief history of ethnomusicology, we have witnessed the promulgation of a wide array of methods for treating music. Most of these methods have received little discussion. It would seem that each has a discrete existence, unquestioningly accepted and passed along only to its creator's students. There are a few exceptions to this; however, for the most part, there has been little of the debate and disagreement which is the developmental essence of other subjects. For the past ninety years, ethnomusicology has addressed itself to the study of music, both as a sound phenomenon and as a behavioral manifesta- tion. The study of musical sound systems per se has an even longer history. Yet no general agreement has been reached; few hypotheses have been discussed or tested. This lack of agreement may be explained, although not excused, by the diversity of training of ethnomusicologists. Some of us were trained as anthropologists; some, as musicologists; few indeed were trained in both disciplines, and some were trained in neither. We are at present united only by a common interest in music. The potential for the development of ethnomusicology is great. A constant stream of new ideas is possible, due to the variety of our training. These ideas, drawn from several different disciplines, could result in the development of a field of study which is tremendously dynamic. Without communication, however, none of this is possible. It is common for a field to exhibit diversity at the beginning. This is particularly true when the actual subject matter of that field is itself quite varied. We have only to look at the history of anthropological theory to understand that that discipline, with its holistic ideal and encyclopedic goals, went through a beginning not unlike our own (see Lowie, 1937). Ethno- musicology has now passed through its infancy. It is time for us to begin the task of summarizing, amalgamating, incorporating, and testing. It is not wise that we should continue to operate in isolation from one another. First, there is the danger that, after several generations of students, we will no longer be able to bridge the already widening terminological and conceptual gap. More importantly, we need the exchange of ideas, the testing of hypotheses in different societies. Only through this process can we ever 219</page><page sequence="2">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS hope to arrive at a unitary method for treating music. Finally, it is our responsibility, as scholars, to communicate and to develop a growing body of shared knowledge. While it is probably not wise to expect total agreement, it does seem logical to wish to evaluate one another's ideas, if only to correct our own. This paper is intended to serve as a catalyst for debate, which, it is hoped, will prove profitable. I have chosen to consider first the only area common to most of us-music as a sound phenomenon. It is in this area that an appraisal of our theoretical positions seems most called for. ASSUMPTIONS We have assumed that what should be done with music is transcription and analysis. But do we really want to analyze? Do we know what analysis is? Webster's unabridged dictionary (1966: 77) tells us that analysis is the "separation or breaking up of a whole into its fundamental elements or component parts." Thus, analysis is the process of examining the attributes and connotations of a concept, idea, or entity. It differs from mere disintegration in that it proceeds according to a definite plan. The end-product of an analysis is a separation of attributes both from the whole of what is being analyzed and from each other. It does not, therefore, increase knowledge, but clarifies, tests, and arranges the parts of a known whole. The process through which we analyze is called deduction, or deductive reasoning. In this method of reasoning, a conclusion (which is often itself called the deduction) is regarded as following logically and necessarily under certain fixed laws from given premises. Thus, what we deduce in a musical analysis is the basic elements or component parts of that music, if we can assume that we are doing so under certain fixed laws. Analysis is to be distinguished from synthesis, which is the combining of separate elements or minor wholes into an inclusive entity. In a synthesis, we use induction, or inductive reasoning. Induction is a term applied to the process of discovering principles through the empirical observation and combination of particular instances or events. Every human plan of action may be viewed as a form of induction, in that it is a scheme devised to meet a given situation, an hypothesis which is put to the test of events. Practical success or failure then verifies or refutes the hypothesis. Let us ask ourselves, then, what is the nature of the knowledge we seek from and about music? Have we established any fixed laws or principles which we can apply to music and thereby analyze it? Would synthesis be more valuable to us than analysis, or should both perhaps be used? 220</page><page sequence="3">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS In recent years, there has been a growing concern among ethno- musicologists with finding a reasonable approach to music. Various methods have been propounded, but there has been little discussion of the relative merits of these methods. If we assume that knowledge, and therefore knowledge about music, is ultimately a cumulative process, a review of previous approaches is required before yet another theory is propounded. Most ethnomusicologists have not presented their ideas in terms of models. For purposes of review, however, this is the most convenient and clearest way to delineate them. PREVIOUS MODELS THE ORGANIC MODEL The use of organic metaphor is usually traced back to Herbert Spencer, Lilienfeld, Worms, and Schaffle. Like the advance of the mechanical model of behavior in an era of influence of physical science, the organic model was inspired by an era of emphasis on biology, sometimes referred to as the Darwinian era. In anthropology, this approach was advocated in print as late as the appearance of Radcliffe-Brown's Structure and Function in Primitive Society (1952). Basically, this approach involves one of two possible analogies. Society is sometimes likened to the relations of parts of an individual biological organism; sometimes, to the relations of a collection of biological organisms making up a species or ecological system. Spencer and his followers likened society to individual organisms, as did Radcliffe-Brown, and this led to contradictions in their position, stemming from their failure to distinguish biological levels of organization. Their position is rather remarkable in view of the fact that Darwinian theory concerns species and phylogeny, rather than individuals and physiology. One spin-off of the organic model which has appeared in ethno- musicological literature is the idea of unilinear evolution. This is a more direct attempt to construct a model of development directly related to the evolu- tionary process. This is exemplified in the work of Sachs and Brandel. In non-evolutionary terms, the timespan and developmental sequences used by historical musicologists also follow this model. THE MECHANICAL MODEL With the rapid advance of mathematics, physics, and mechanics in the seventeenth century, scholars turned to the same methods in interpretation of 221</page><page sequence="4">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS human behavior, partly in rejection of the less palatable teleology, mysticism, and anthropomorphism of other views. Thus, a 'social mechanics' developed, which viewed man as a physical object, a type of elaborate machine, whose actions and mental processes could be analyzed in terms of the principles of mechanics. In Sorokin's view (1928), the 'social physics" of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries was only a variation of seventeenth-century attempts. This was followed, in the second half of the nineteenth century, by a revival of seventeenth century ideas, although generally without acknowl- edgements. This includes H. C. Carey, A. Bently, and Pareto. Pareto, a trained engineer, used only the more general mechanical principles that seemed to apply to social phenomena on the methodological or heuristic levels. This approach involved a basic concept of 'system' of mutually interdependent elements, which may be in a state of 'equilibrium', such that any changes in the elements themselves or in their interrelations away from a position of equilibrium are counterbalanced by other changes which tend to restore it. This conception has, in turn, been taken over by many social scientists, notably George C. Homans and Talcott Parsons. Several ethnomusicologists have used mechanical models in their descriptions of music. These include von Hornbostel, George Herzog, Helen H. Roberts, and Bruno Nettl. THE PROCESS MODEL Yet another model, which might be attributed at least in part to intellectual environment, is the process model. Murdock (1955), Firth (1955), Nadel (1957), and Vogt (1960) have all put forth eloquent declarations that structure is falsely conceived as static, and change as pathological as in the mechanical and organic models. Rather, they argue that it is necessary to pose the primacy of change, considering structure to be simply the manner in which progressing reality is translated into an instantaneous and artificial observation for the individual. Structures, then, are only intersections in time and space of ongoing process. McLeod, Boiles, Herndon, and, by implication, Kaeppler, have been experimenting with this model. THE MATHEMATICAL MODELS Recently there has been a proliferation of models based on mathematics, perhaps reflecting increased influence of scientific methodology. Both predic- tive and descriptive models are to be found, at several levels of abstraction. An excellent exposition of more common mathematical models is to be found in Kemeny and Snell's Mathematical Models in the Social Sciences (1962). 222</page><page sequence="5">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS Examples of the use of this model are to be found in Freeman and Merriam (1956), Merriam on the Flathead (1966), and McLeod on the Kutenai (1971). PREVIOUS MODELS: A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE If we are to begin with the data, structured sound, a review of specific approaches to music is necessary. England (1964) has given several of our colleagues the opportunity to transcribe the same piece, and to discuss the problems involved. What I propose to do is to take a single transcription and subject it to various methods of analysis. In this way, it will be possible to criticize my propositions, since they will be placed in the environment of the views and approaches of others. The song I have chosen for analysis is "Zaodahy!" (Oh, Brother-in-law!) from Madagascar. It was recorded on May 14, 1962, near the town of Loharano, district of Antisirabe, by Dr. Norma McLeod, who later transcribed it.1 The cultural unit involved is not a "tribe" in the usual sense of the word, but a regional group which calls itself Vakin'ankaratra (the people of Ankaratra). The group lies between the Merina and the Betsileo, and is heavily influenced by the Merina, although Betsileo in origin (cf. McLeod, 1966). The singer is Razakandrainibe (Son of Great-Father), an all-round professional musician (cf. McLeod, 1964) who is known by his nickname, Kasoka (Rapid-Fingers). He sings alone in the recording, accompanying himself on a case zither (valiha), although the song, when used in its proper ceremonial context, usually requires a second singer. The second singer duplicates the melodic line a third above the first singer. Both vocal lines are considered to be of equal importance. The song is a Hira alavolon-jaza, or song for the hair-cutting ceremony. About a month after the birth of a child, a ceremonial celebration of the first hair-cut is held. This must take place at the time of the new moon immediately after birth, and it is accompanied by feasting. A dish of rice, meat, and hot vegetables is prepared, and is served on a rice vanner. The vanner is covered with a banana leaf divided into four equal portions. A second leaf is placed around the edge. The food is divided into fourteen portions and covered with honey. After the cutting, the child's hair clippings are mixed with honey and white earth and placed in the portions of food. The head and mouth of the baby are covered with the mixture, and the rest is given to the women, who smear it on their faces to increase their fertility (Du Bois, 1938:385-86). The hair-cutting ceremony has in recent years been modernized. Other children and their parents are invited, a feast is held, and candy and money are thrown to the children at the moment of the hair-cutting. 223</page><page sequence="6">224 HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS Professional musicians are hired to sing songs for the ceremony and to provide general entertainment. "Zaodahy" is for the ceremony, but there is no particular time for it to be sung and it has no ritual properties. The text of this song is extremely elliptical, but other songs of the same type are very full and may praise either the child or the father. The rite is presently passing into disuse. In many families, the mixture of hair, honey, and white earth is no longer prepared, and the hair is placed in a baby book instead (cf. McLeod, 1966). The title of Malagasy songs comes from the first words of the song. Thus, this song is called "Zaodahy" (brother-in-law). The term has no kinship significance here, but is a greeting between the singer and the father of the child.

Descriptive (organic)2 This song of Razakandrainibe (Son of Great-Father), who is known as Kasoka (Rapid-Fingers), is very witty poetry. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful and poignant examples of music from the island of Madagascar. One is tempted to compare it with lilting melodies of popular Western music; however, comparisons in respect of absolute beauty are impertinent. Masterpieces of art should never be compared, except as to technicalities and historical matters. When a work of art has attained perfection, it is a form of infinity; and with infinities no process of addition, subtraction, or other arithmetical operation has the slightest relevance (Tovey, 1939:(VI)1). The piece is scored for solo voice and valiha. The soft and somewhat sudsy resonance of this stringed instrument lends appropriate atmosphere to the occasion for which this song is intended, that of the first hair-cutting of a small child. The suave, refined tone quality of the valiha (itself surprising among a people so little evolved) couples with the elegant simplicity of the vocal line to produce an aura of happy, simple reverence and propriety in the ceremony. The rhythmic unity and recurring forms in the valiha part are so captivating and so deceptively normal in their phrasing that the first impres- sion of Stanza 1 is sufficient to carry the listener through the whole of the rest, however unfamiliar Kasoka's style may be to him. In addition, the soothing simplicity of the voice part lulls the listener into blissful unawareness that this is indeed non-Western, non-advanced music. The scale is European, which provides further accommodation and comfort to the Western ear. Indeed, it is probable that the natives have recognized in our advanced Western scales an advantage of expressive possibilities and have adapted these into their system. If this is not the case, the ideal of singing in thirds certainly demonstrates an evolutionary advance in their musical thinking. In the text, complex metaphors are interwoven, causing double mean- ings. For example, the second line is Ny ahoana, e! (Greetings). Ahoana means what or how, but as the line is elided in the text it may also mean 'What did you do?' (in order to produce the child). The singer probably intended to pun here. The form is strophic and complex, and has three sections. Generally, however, this does not hamper variation, which proceeds blissfully to alter both text and melody when artistically desirable. 227</page><page sequence="10">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS The song as a whole gives an impression of rapid gayness and extreme poetic sophistication, while reminding the listener of the poetry of a witty, insightful, but uneducated peasant. Behind the seemingly innocuous text lurks Kasoka's earthy peasant outlook on sex and the world at large. 2. Descriptive (organic)3 Zaodahy is one of the type of songs sung for the ceremony of the first hair-cut of a Malagasy infant. The general structure of the piece is strophic, with three verses: (1) verse one-ms. 1-10; (2) verse two-ms. 11-24; (3) verse three-ms. 25-35. Phrasing is irregular. The sophisticated interplay of delicately balanced variation among the verses affords the total structure an aspect of smoothness not unlike polished glass or steel. Although the three verses are closely related the first and third verses act to unify the whole piece, and are very nearly alike. The second verse is freer, and adds a streak of bright artistry and vitality, lending sparkling impetus to the song as a whole. Thus, tension and release may be viewed as being present not only at the phrase level, as would be expected, but at the verse level as well. There is smoothly integrated interplay between the notes of the valiha and those of the vocal part throughout. The dialog begins with the first measure, when the valiha anticipates the vocal melody, and continues through- out the entire piece. The top line of the valiha part often plays the same rhythm and melody as the vocal line, but a 3rd above it, as seen in ms. 4-5. The meter is steady at M.M J = 72 but very fast and in eighth and sixteenth notes, lending lightness to the song. The rhythmic progression is intricate and complex, due to the speed at which the piece seems to progress. The piece is non-canonic, and tends to be chordal in nature. The scale resembles the European major scale in tuning, but not in use. The harmony seems to be generally tonal, but progressions are not those normally expected in Western music. Chords are usually in second inversion, notably the f-a-d chord which recurs many times. Harmonic flow is, however, mostly non- chordal, proceeding in parallel thirds. The open fourths and fifths sketched in the valiha part in ms. 1 set a hollow but vibrant mood which continues throughout the piece. The final cadence is from a g-b reiteration to an f-a tremolo by way of a grace note g-f in the bass line. At the end, a d appears at the bottom, hinting that the tonal base may be d. It is more likely, however, that the base is g and the d indicates that the piece really ends on the dominant. This would symbolize an unfinished, continuing phenomenon, and would be very appropriate, since the child whose hair is cut is indeed not finished, but just beginning to live. 228</page><page sequence="11">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS 3.

Classificatory (mechanical, process)6 The piece now under consideration would be classified as Hepta- (7), since it requires seven places on the cycle of fifths: FCGDAEB It is further classified as a Hepta-6, since it requires 6-tint degree relationships. Another major factor is the "scale formula." (Kolinski 1961). This is a representation of the main features of the tonal structure of the vocal part. The mode is a Hepta-G-mode, with six tints: fGabcd Differentiations in structural importance of the tones employed are expressed as follows: = = Tonal center(s) o = Other notes of major importance * = Notes of medium importance A = Notes of slight importance A ^ indicates the initial tone; a , indicates the final tone. A t indicates ascending steps within the piece; a *- indicates descending steps; a i indicates that the notes are not connected through steps. The resulting scale formula for Zaodahy! is as follows: 17) 18) 19) 20) 21) 22) 23) 24) 25) 26) 27) 28) 29) 30) 31) 32) 33) 34) 35) 36) 37) 232  I--</page><page sequence="15">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS 233 p (0--iCi5 72- j, 0 The Major second is the most frequent tone step (72%), followed by the minor second (16%), the perfect fourth (8%), the Major third (2%), and the minor third (1%). Reiterations occur in the interior portion of the strophes, with an alternation of five (first) and three, one step higher. The tonal structure is both closed and open. It is closed in that tints are represented in two octaves so far as the range admits duplications. It is open in the bottom part of the total range possible to the 13th degree (thirteen tones are omitted). The level formula is 77?: 0? (-77?). The level formula expresses the mutual relation between the initial, final, highest and lowest tone. The Melodic structure is considered to be of great importance. Kolinski has developed a complex system of classification and notation of melodic structure (Kolinski 1964b). The melodic structure of the piece is as follows: -d 2 l la o i - 2 I -G _ f rrs.

The structures above are classified in the Kolinski system as follows: 1. first structure on line 1: Heterogenous pendulum, 1st0 nexus, indirect ascent 2. second structure on line 1: indirect ascent 3. first structure on line 2: indirect descent, second and third degree direct nexuses, rising overlapping complex, wide-centered falling down zig-zags 4. first structure on line 3: indirect ascent, fourth degree direct nexuses 5. second structure on line 3: first degree direct nexus, indirect ascent 6. first structure, line 4: heterogenous pendulum containing 5 pitches 7. second structure, line 4: rising down-hook, indirect ascent 8. third structure, line 4: first degree direct nexus 9. first structure, line 5: falling down-hook, indirect descent. Kolinski concentrates on a small number of factors. His "analysis" consists of assigning derived structures to their proper position in his own terminological and classificatory systems. In addition, he subjects pieces of music to arithmetic manipulation. He is interested in the relative frequency of intervals, the level formula, and in tempo.

Classificatory (mechanical, process)8 Zaodahy! is a song for the first hair-cutting of a Malagasy infant. It is the only such song in the Madagascar Collection at Tulane University; therefore, generalization about the style is impossible. Song 1: M XVIII McL, 1: Ou-d: J. = 72 ZAODAHY! Tonal range-The tonal range is falling, 9 semitones, average. Melodic level, direction and contour-The melodic level of this song is expressed in the formula 77?:0?; the level difference is thus -77?. The over-all contour of the song is arc, as judged from the placement of beginning, ending, highest, and lowest tones, The beginning is two semitones higher than the ending tone. The total range is not expressed by the beginning-ending tone relationship. The highest tone is seven semitones above the beginning tone. The lowest tone is two semitones lower than the beginning tone, while the ending tone is the lowest tone in the vocal part of the piece. Phrases are of unequal length, but all tend to exhibit arc form. They begin and end on the same note or begin on one note and end two semitones above that note. For example, the first phrase begins and ends on G. This is not the case throughout, but the phrase patterns all exhibit a marked tendency toward arc form. Melodic intervals-The following are the melodic intervals used in the song. They are expressed in semitones and are divided into ascending and descend- ing intervals. Semitone Interval No. Ascending No. Descendilg 1) (minor second) 4 12 2) (major second) 27 45 3) (minor third) 1 - 4) (major third) 1 1 5) (perfect fourth) 8 6) (augmented fourth) 7) (perfect fifth) 12) (octave) - - 236</page><page sequence="19">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS Five intervals are used ascending and three descending. Ascending intervals make up 41% of the total intervals used; descending intervals 58%. Most of the intervals are narrow. The large total number of single and double semitone intervals (88) is a special point to be noted. The tendency of wider skips is to be ascending, which, in an arc form would account for the larger number of smaller descending intervals. Melodic interval patterns-The use of the m2 and M2 seems to predominate. The use of repetitive monotone occurs seven times. Ornamentation-The song is sung by a single individual, who uses a rising attack consistently. There is no use of rising or falling release, dumbell, dip, or bend. Syncopation is found. Formal structure-This song is strophic, but each strophe is slightly varied. 'The pattern of phrases is /:/ a a a b b c d c d c /:/e. Scale, mode, duration tone, and subjective tonic-There is no scale. The mode is Hepta-6. Duration tone is G and the subjective tonic is G. Melodic meter, tempo figure, and durational values-The song is even and in 6/8 meter. The tempo figure is 198.4. Dotted quarter, quarter, dotted eighth, eighth, dotted sixteenth, sixteenth, and thirty-second notes are used in the following percentages: 1%, 2+%, 9%, 36%, 2%, 42%, 6%. Accompaniment-Case zither (valiha) is used to accompany the singer. Other remarks-This song is lacking one singer, who would sing the same melody a third higher. An adequate sample is not available for analysis. Whether hair-cutting songs could be differentiated from other types of songs were the sample larger is not known and cannot be predicted. 8. Synthetic-analytic (process)9 (1) Melodic contours Arch form of phrases, which seem to be defined by an upward skip at the beginning and progressive downward motion to the end; larger structure 237</page><page sequence="20">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS defined by repetition of original phrase pattern; last note is longest in song; dialogue between valiha and voice. r,J-r -NT JNLr-FLJ _rLL LN., _rL JLL, Chart of Melodic Contour: Voice &amp; Valiha (2) Synthesis10 The phrase is defined by coterminousness of semantic units in the text with musical units. Musical units present problems in definition. Absolute beginning and end of patterns cannot be determined by presence of any significant metric or rhythmic patterns; however, melodic patterns fall into regular groups according to form (arc), and are found to be coterminous with the arbitrary rhythmic patterns. The dialogue between valiha and voice provides confirmation of some phrases, in that some phrases are thus shown to be in existence and bounded by silence. There is congruence between the melodic and rhythmic patterns of valiha and voice and text patterns (where the latter are present). For larger divisions, three sections of AXCD occur, and can be defined as repetitive units. Since AXCD is followed by AXCD and AXCD, we can assume a second structural level is present. The ending is indicated by a signal-complex: the final /i/ in the word "gasy" is heard for the first time; the final note is lengthened in the voice part; the valiha part employs a long tremolo for the first time; the valiha part goes down to a low D for the first time. (3) Final statement Pattern congruence is used as a a priori assumption for making structural statements. On this basis, the structure of the song becomes more logical and coherent. The phrase and one larger architectonic level may be defined. Based on traditional categories of musical form, the piece may be said to be strophic. 238</page><page sequence="21">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS A number of factors have not been described. No attempt has been made to define pitch system, metric system, or mode, for example. There are reasons for this omission. Measuring equipment flexible enough to capture the pitches, and thereby the pitch system, does not exist, since present mechanical transcribers cannot handle more than one line. The metric system defies analysis, since we lack a clear definition of meter. Mode is problematical, because the melodic conceptions of the Malagasy include the idea of double melody of equal importance for each line, and there seems to be no sensible way of defining mode in such a situation. Further, it is not thought to be advisable to define mode in the absence of measuring devices sensitive enough to indicate the pitch system. PREVIOUS MODELS: A COMMENTARY Some commentary on the previous models presented above is necessary. The first two models, which I have called Descriptive (organic), are verbaliza- tions about certain traditional aspects of musical sound. Instrumentation, general form, melody, harmony, rhythm, and other factors may be mentioned; however, it should be noted that these aspects of music are arbitrary, traditional, and often ill-defined. Further, they are discussed through employ- ment of descriptive terms whose meanings are blunted by use of intersense modalities (see Merriam, 1964). Cadential formulae are thought to be of great importance, and are often quoted. In addition, a subjective reason is sought and offered in explanation of any ending which is considered to be unusual or unexpected. Performer and composer are often lionized, although either or both may be ignored if the analyst feels they are not among the great. Music is felt to be a truly creative art, and its creators and performers are ranked by some mysterious process known instinctively by the analyst. Particularly in these first two analyses, total attention is focussed upon the musical transcription rather than upon the sound itself. Description appears to be the goal. To a certain extent, any analysis is a kind of description. But that description should not be open to wide variation in interpretation. Intersense modalities, in particular, are not clear. For example, the impression that a musical passage is as smooth as polished glass or steel may evoke many different responses in the minds of readers. Polished steel may be smooth, cold, very hot, slick, bright, heavy; polished glass may evoke thoughts of transparency, fragility, or even danger. This lack of precision renders any stability or definiteness in analysis impossible. The third and fourth models presented above, those I have called Trait listing (mechanical), represent a realization that intersense modalities are not 239</page><page sequence="22">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS sufficiently precise. In these models, the idea of the trait list has been borrowed from the history of anthropological methodology and superimposed on the traditional Western ideas concerning important elements of music. In the third model, there is definite order in the analysis, but certain parts seem redundant, especially elements #5 and 6 (Rhythm, Rhythmic Organization). For the analysis as a whole, one wonders about the purpose of considering these particular items, or traits of music, and why they were selected as being of significance. If they are indeed significant, why are they? For example, does all music have a tonic? If a society lacks the idea of a tonal center is it valid to posit or assume one? If it is necessary to posit a tonic, what determinants should be used? In this particular piece, G is more frequent in number and duration of occurrences than F; why then must F be the tonic? What is the significance of intervals and their distribution? If intervals are thought to be of importance for purposes of comparison, are they significant on one level or several? What is the level of comparison- piece, form, style, type, society, or area? In addition, one wonders about the purpose of melodic pattern diagrams (model #3, section 2a). If they are done for purposes of comparison, on what level is comparison to be undertaken? In the discussion of intervals (model #3, section 2c), there is an implied agreement with Sachs' classification of societies into: 1) small intervals = logogenic (word-born) 2) average intervals = melogenic (music-born) 3) large intervals = pathogenic (motion-born) (Nettl, 1956:55). If one agrees with Sachs, how do we determine the boundaries between small and average intervals, or between average and large ones? Is, for example, a perfect fourth a large interval or an average interval? In the discussion of ornamentation, yet another question arises (see model #3, section 3). Is ornamentation a valid concept when one is dealing with non-written music? How are we to determine what is extra or orna- mental to a basic musical line? Is it possible to do so with mere sound, or do we not also need information from the makers of that sound? Finally, what is significant in the study of rhythm and form (model #3, sections 5, 6, 7)? How is form determined or recognized? We musicians can usually identify a form almost unconsciously, but what processes are at work? Although the fourth model, taken from Lomax's Cantometrics project (Lomax, 1968), is not, strictly speaking, intended for analysis of pieces per se, it nevertheless provides us with another example of the use of trait listing. In this case, the traits have been chosen for the purpose of comparing the musics of the cultures of the world. Lomax provides us with a good deal of comment and criticism of his own work; however, he does leave a few points in 240</page><page sequence="23">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS question. The first and most obvious problem is that this method does not deal with purely instrumental music. Secondly, it seems redundant to code a sheet in both numbers and symbols. Lomax feels that the symbols will be easily memorized; would it not also be easy to memorize the numbers? His categories themselves resemble those presented in the third model, and are therefore subject to the same questions presented above. In addition, there is a tendency in the fourth model of analysis to lump disjunct categories together. For example, no distinction is allowed in this system between a singer who accompanies himself and one who is accompanied by another person. Further, in line 11, rhythm and meter are placed together, an arbitrary lumping which is not justified. The system advocated through use of model four is ambitious; through its application it is thought possible to make large-scale generalizations about musical systems of the world and their relation to other aspects of culture. Lomax advises against making fine distinctions, saying that too many small distinctions may "choke the classification system or change the level of classification" (Lomax, 1968:38). Large-scale classifications are both necessary and desirable, but a serious question arises as to how much freedom one should be allowed to take in glossing over differences, at least some of which might prove to be of a definitive nature. Certainly some precision must be sacrificed in order to achieve generalizations of a high order, but great care must be taken in determining just what it is that may be sacrificed. In the Trait lists (models 3 and 4), then, we may say that categories chosen are traditional ones. Acceptance of their validity is automatic and unquestioning. However, if it is ever going to be possible for us to arrive at a rational means for dealing with music, it would seem necessary to begin with a close examination of the usefulness of each of our beloved traits and categories. Otherwise, we may only continue to herd our sacred cows. The fifth model, which I have called Classificatory (mfechanical, process), is taken from the Kolinski system of analysis. It is as precise as the Lomax model is general. Kolinski is interested in a small set of items which he believes to be definitive of any music under analysis. His work represents a continuation and refinement of the von Hornbostel methods. As Kolinski says, "in my opinion a fruitful analysis of the tonal construction of music ... is possible only after certain fundamental questions concerning the nature of tonal construction have been clarified" (1964:241). To him, the original problem lies in naming the source of the tone complexes. To this end, he adheres to a concept which he calls tint. Tint is the quality which is identical in octave tones and more or less dissimilar in other tone relations. He sees the ratios of the quintal, or Pythagorean, intervals as the physical equivalent of tint relations (1962), and has developed a complex classificatory system based on these ratios. Since the Pythagorean ratios are symbolized by the cycle of 241</page><page sequence="24">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS fifths, he feels that the placement, within this cycle, of tint complexes reflect the various types of tonal constructions. However, not everyone bases tonal systems on mathematical principles, and there is no indication that even a majority of societies are aware of Pythagorean principles. We are not even agreed that such a common phenomenon as the octave is a universal one. As a result, we would like to have more explanation of Kolinski's reasoning in espousing and expanding von Hornbostel's ideas. It is unfortunate that the scholar desiring to apply Kolinski's methods of analysis runs into difficulties. The basic means of arriving at certain elements, such as level formula, are not in print. Nor is, for example, the reason for excluding silence in the tempo formula given in print. Vital basic methodology is transmitted by word-of-mouth, and this is at best imprecise. More impor- tantly, once the classification of these items is accomplished, what insights are gained into the piece(s) of music being examined? What is the value of this system? What is it seeking to accomplish? The basic purpose would seem to be a comparative one. At what level and by what means is comparison to be effected? Are we dealing with a method of analysis or with a circular polemic? One is, in this case, not certain. Models 6 and 7, which I have also termed Classificatory (mechanical, process), are in reality the same model. They differ only in that the latter is written out, while the former is presented in the form of a chart. In addition, the seventh model does add a statement about the number of intervals used ascending and descending, puts the interval size in parentheses beside the number of ascending and descending semitones, and substitutes the words 'bend' and 'dip' for rising and falling dumbells. Both models are intended to represent the methods advocated by Merriam. In his analyses, Merriam directs his attention toward obtaining as objective a picture of musical structure as possible. To this end, he method- ically eliminates subjective judgements. He stresses the use of precise mathe- matical formulae and the statistical approach wherever possible. In his attempt to classify and compare music of the Ketu cult of Bahia, Brazil, and the Rada cult of Trinidad, using the discriminant function, Merriam has presented the only application of statistical classification in ethnomusicology (Freeman and Merriam, 1956). Since we are only examining one song here, this aspect of his analytical techniques cannot be illustrated. Merriam is greatly concerned with the problem of sample size, and seems to be in doubt as to what constitutes an acceptable sample of a musical style. Thus, his analyses are usually prefaced by statements regarding the size of the sample being dealt with. It is logical that we should all concern ourselves with the size of our sample, and that we should seek-in the absence of a definitive statement or guidelines in this matter-to collect the largest possible sample. 242</page><page sequence="25">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS This model of analysis employs techniques used by von Hornbostel and Kolinski, and follows both in not putting the method used for deriving certain basic items into easily available printed form. For example, the method of arriving at modal structure and duration tone is to be found in footnotes 10 and 11 in an article in Anthropos (Merriam, Whinery, and Fred 1956:162-163; 164). Total explication of methodology and rationale remains in the oral tradition of Merriam students. Although Meriam eliminates most of the common subjective judgments found in musical analysis, he nevertheless fails to define what it is that constitutes a phrase. Nor does he define what it is he means by narrow, medium, or wide intervals. In both of these areas, subjective judgment must be used. Model eight, which I have called the Synthetic-analytic model, is based on the work of McLeod. In the sense that she represents a continuing reduction of subjective judgements and use of intersense modalities, her work might be said to fall into the von Hornbostel-Kolinski-Merriam stream. In methodology, she represents a departure. McLeod advocates a return to the basic data (that is, music) as the primary source of analysis. Basing her approach on linguistic methodology and the philosophical stance of British social anthropology, she proposes that musical analyses have, in the past, accepted too many a priori categories. This is all quite logical, in many ways. However, her methodology remains in the oral tradition, unless one wishes to consult her as yet unpublished doctoral dissertation (1966). The final description arrived at using McLeod's model is clear and free from too many a priori categories. It seems to be a good first step in bringing order and precision to the analysis of music. The concept of significant features, and the use of coterminousness of two or more features for definition of significance, may prove to be useful in comparing musics of the world. Two main problems are encountered with model eight. The first difficulty lies in the extreme length of analyses. When definitional bases are established for other elements of music, the analysis of one song might easily run to over a hundred pages. However, condensation is possible. The second problem is perhaps more serious: McLeod has not given us a means of objectively cross-checking our analyses. Subjective cross-checking is possible with her method, but it would seem that both subjective and objective means are ultimately necessary. This stance will be explained in the following sections of this paper. TOWARD A NEW RATIONALE: THE IDEAL The commonest use of models in ethnomusicology seems to be the more static ones. The consequence of the use of a static model is that, since change 243</page><page sequence="26">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS is not accounted for, descriptions tend to take on the quality of absolutes. When such models are compared with the data, they seem inadequate. As a result of this, Charles Seeger has pointed out how little relationship there is between what is said about music and the music itself. He has posed us a complex problem in distinguishing two modes of discourse-speech, or talking about music; and music itself, or making music. As he puts it: The relationship of the (intrinsic) music-rationale known by the musician to any of the (extrinsic) speech-rationales of music or to the whole collection of them constitutes one of the fundamental problems of musicology. (1960:225). This is the same problem mentioned by Manfred Bukofzer (1957) in discussing the difference between knowledge of music and knowledge about music. It is the distinction made between musicology and performance practice. Many ethnomusicologists also view this distinction as a problem. Mantle Hood (1971:227) comments: ... the ethnomusicologist is committed forevermore to the problems of the speech-music syndrome delineated by Seeger in his reference to points of identity, similarity, and difference in communicable contents. With reference to this opposition of speech-rationale and music-rationale, I would like to term it 'Seeger's Dilemma,' in the same manner as we would speak of Galton's Problem or Goldstein's Dilemma, and to attempt its solution. It is only through solving 'Seeger's Dilemma' that we can begin to approach a model for music. As scholars, it is presently our fate to present our ideas, observations, analyses, and experiences in a two-dimensional (written) form. We are confined to, and limited by, the traditional scholarly concern with the written word. We cannot, as ethnomusicologists, agree as to the meanings of the terms we use. Nor can we reach precision in the transcription and analysis of our sound data, in converting it to two-dimensional (written) form. Further, while Merriam and others have long advocated that the total study of music must include its cultural environment, actual publications would seem to indicate that this is an ideal only sometimes reached. What, then, is possible when we seem to be lacking in the normal theoretical and practical "baggage" of other scholars? Bierstedt suggests, in the Introduction to Judith Willer's The Social Determination of Knowledge, that there may be something about society itself that influences the very nature of knowledge. 244</page><page sequence="27">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS Is it possible, for example, that questions that demand answers in one society, at one period of history, are not even asked in another society, at another period? Here one would clearly respond in the affirmative. No one in modern industrial societies wonders whether, if God is all-powerful, he can restore virginity to a prostitute; no one debates whether the mouse that steals into the cathedral and eats the consecrated wafer has partaken of the body of Christ; and no one asks himself why God, who is presumed to be eternal, did not create the universe, say, some 600,000 years earlier than he did. (What was he waiting for?) Similarly, no one in tenth century Europe wondered whether the speed of light is a constant, whether the structure of DNA, the heredity molecule, is singly or double helical, or whether the division of labor in an organized group is a simple or complex function of its size. (Willer, 1971:2) Will it later be thought that we of this time period and of this place were reacting to social stimulae, to passing fads, as it were, of knowledge? Are we reacting to the supremacy of mathematics and the 'hard' sciences in the same manner that earlier scholars tried to apply Darwinian principles to their data whether those principles fit or not? I would propose that wherever the fads and fashions of science and the pressure of society at this particular time and place may be pushing us, we must still remember that our basic concern is with music and musical systems. Put rather tritely, music is our main and unifying field of study, and it is to music, not to fads, that we must turn for a source of theory. There are at least two broad dimensions which demand our attentions as ethnomusicologists: music, and its cultural environment. Perhaps we still argue about what constitutes a 'period' or even what identifies a 'phrase'; however, beneath our differences, we must all have a basic conviction that music is patterned, and, if we have any anthropological training at all, we must believe that behavior, and consequently musical behavior, is also patterned. Thus, the basic a priori assumption is of patterning. To speak of patterning assumes the existence of structure. As Harary, Norman, and Cartwright point out: The word 'structure' is found extensively in the literature of the social sciences. 'Social structure' and such related concepts as 'kinship structure,' 'authority structure,' 'cognitive structure,' and 'attitude structure.' Linguists are interested in the 'structure of a language' or 'syntactical structure.' . . But despite the widespread use of structural concepts in the social sciences, it is fair to say that the formal analysis of structure has been relatively underdeveloped in these fields. The technical terminology employed in describing structures is meager; few concepts are defined rigorously. As a consequence, the social scientific description of structural properties tends to be couched in ambiguous terminology, and detailed studies of structure, as such, are rather rare. (1965:1) 245</page><page sequence="28">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS In discussing the structure, or patterning, of music, we cannot turn to the social sciences. I have suggested that to turn to the 'hard' sciences or mathematics might be simply an indication of social pressures or of fashion. We are left, then, with music, in its cultural environment. I would not wish to ponder here the nature of music, or whether it is universal, near-universal, or non-universal. Rather, I would hope to assume, as George List (1971:399) does, the pragmatic approach that whatever music communicates, it communicates to the members of the in-group only, whoever they may be. It is to this in-group, whatever its size, and to the musical performance in its cultural context, that we must direct our attention. What approach is necessary to gather data concerning a musical/cultural system? To return to Seeger's Dilemma, do we 'music' music or do we 'speech' music? In anthropological terms, to 'music' music is to engage oneself in participant observation. It has been found that this is quite often a very useful technique; however, it is only one of several techniques which may help the scholar in the field. Other techniques include observation, directive or non-directive interviews, the hypothetical situation, the eliciting of tax- onomies, the study of social space, the analysis of the cultural performance or occasion, or the description of material culture. The first and perhaps most critical task in the field, in terms of arriving at a theory for music, is to seek the boundaries of a music. A boundary is that which indicates or fixes a limit or extent (Webster 1966:260). With reference to musical systems, the boundaries of a musical system would include two dimensions: 1) that range of sound-configurations which is accepted by a particular group or ingroup as music, and 2) the music-related behavior of the group. I am speaking here of a type of cognitive system, based on and capable of being reduced to empirical knowledge. We know that musical systems are not necessarily the same as other social, linguistic, ethnic, or territorial boundaries. (Note, for example, the extremely wide territorial, ethnic, and linguistic range of Beatle music not very long ago). We know that boundaries themselves are only cognitive units. Tennessee, California, or Canada exist only as long as we think of them as entities; the difference between who is black, Chicano, or Indian and who is not may depend upon legal consensus, and may vary between two states. Musical systems, then, are bounded by cognition in the same manner as other types of human boundaries, but may not be identical with them. If we accept the idea of musical systems as cognitive systems, this entails a rethinking of our concepts and approaches. With regard to the outer limits of musical systems, we must reconsider the implications of aesthetics in particular. Aesthetics is often defined as the study of the beautiful. Apel suggests that "musical aesthetics is the study of the relationship of music to the human senses and intellect" (1969:14). He views his definition as 246</page><page sequence="29">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS corresponding to the original meaning of the Greek word aisthesis. Haydon, however, cites the same Greek word as concerning sensuous rather than conceptual data: "The word aesthetics is derived from the Greek word ataoO rTtKs, perceptive, especially by feeling.... Thus, originally it con- cerned sensuous rather than conceptual data." (1941:118). Clearly, we cannot escape the common definition of aesthetics as the study of the beautiful through etymology. What this definition lacks in clarity is the implication of a consensus about the nature of music, i.e., a shared aesthetic. Since we are talking about what people feel, and perhaps what they think, we can assume one of two things about their thoughts; either they all think differently, which would mean that the definition of music is culturally free, or they share some consensus at least about the nature of music. This latter idea is clearly more nearly true, since music is patterned. If music were allowed to be culturally free, we could not identify styles, forms, or types. Each composer could do what he pleased, and listeners would all think differently about what he had done. The facts deny this. Every culture has definitional boundaries which limit musical patterning in some way. Thus, there must be a shared idea about music which is coterminous with a pattern of music. It is the shared aesthetic boundaries which establish the cultural context of musical systems. A model for the approach to aesthetic systems is provided for us in Adrienne Kaeppler's "Aesthetics of Tongan Dance," (1971:175-185), while a more generalized approach to cognitive systems is found in Tyler's Cognitive Anthropology (1969) and Hammel's Formal Semantic Analysis (1965). As Kaeppler (1971:175) views it: ... art is defined as cultural forms that result from creative processes which manipulate movement, sound, or materials. Aesthetics is defined as ways of thinking about such forms. The aesthetic, viewed cross-culturally, is not simply a matter of dis- cerning the good, the true, and the beautiful. Rather, the boundaries of the aesthetic of a musical group are coterminous with the limit of allowable innovation. If that limit is exceeded, the result is likely to be labelled non-music. That this is so is provided in two examples: 1) In Western classical music, Slonimsky's Lexicon of Musical Invective (1953) provides us with myriad instances through time is which composers have been criticized for creating 'non-music', 2) In Maltese folk music there is the case of the creator who exceeded his group's limits of allowable variation and was then ostracized because he was no longer playing "music" (v. McLeod, 1970). Certainly, an aesthetic must include all value judgments; however, it does not include those items which are not considered to be music. 247</page><page sequence="30">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS While it is true that not every society introspects about its music to the extent of having a formal verbalized theory, it is equally true that members of any society can and do distinguish between music and 'non-music'. This ability would seem to indicate a set of criteria which establish the nature of music in that society, whether or not there is conscious verbalization of them. If we view a musical system as equal to the outer limits of its aesthetic boundaries, since it is only within the culturally acceptable range that value judgments will be made at all, it would then seem that these aesthetic boundaries, or what is accepted by the group or in-group as music, canalize musical systems (in the same manner as the enculturation process canalizes the infant's generalized need for liquid into a preference for milk, Kool-Aid, or cows' blood). Further, I would propose that it is perfectly possible to discover these cognitive criteria and later to subject them to formal analysis. The new orientation would focus on discovering how different peoples organize and use the realm of sound, and how they think of it. The object of study would concern not only the music itself, but how sound phenomena are organized in people's minds. Beyond simply establishing the outer boundaries of musical systems, the cognitive approach implies two basic questions: 1)what sets of sound are significant for the people of a particular group; 2) how do they organize these sets of sound? Groups differ in both the selection and organization of sound phenomena. In addition, within a group, there is variation. Different phenomena are organized in more than one way. There is, then, both inter- and intra-group variation. A consequence of this variation is the idea that musical systems are not simple, unitary phenomena. That is, they cannot necessarily be described by only one set of organizing principles. Choices must be made by a society as to which set of organizing principles will be used. These choices are determined by the immediate situation or social context. There are rules for these choices, although they may not be conscious and verbalized rules. This is an argument for a kind of description which sees unity as emerging from the ordered relations between variants and contexts. Variants are not to be viewed as deviations from some assumed basic organization. Rather, with their rules of occurrence they are the organization. For example, McLeod (1971) has taken statements about the organization of a religious ceremony and compared them directly to the music incorporated in that ceremony, demonstrating clear congruences. I would not wish to suggest, as Chomsky (1965) was accused of doing, that this second aspect of the cognitive approach replicates the cognitive system of one's informants. On the contrary, it involves the active intrusion of the ethnomusicologist, who states, to the best of his or her ability, what the variations and rules of occurrence are. The ethnomusicologist's model, then, is 248</page><page sequence="31">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS probably different from that of the informant. However, the methods of description are public and replicable; the results are predictive of the expectations of appropriate sounds and behavior, and to the extent that it will generate conceptual models approximating those used by a particular group, it is a model of their cognitive systems. Conversely, if the model does not generate appropriate sounds and behavior, it will fall of its own weight. I am not attempting here to propound a model of music which is hierarchical. Although the first two components, the aesthetic and the selection/organization begin to sound like a macro-micro distinction, this is abolished by the third component, the learning process. Culture is often defined as learned, cumulative behavior. If we view music as a part of culture, then music must also be learned, cumulative behavior. It would seem, then, that an understanding of the learning process would be of vital importance to any approach to a model of music. Seeger's Dilemma implies that the music-rationale, which includes the learning process, is irreconcilable with the speech-rationale. Yet, is the learning process not a cognitive process, whether learning is accomplished by imitation, verbalized instruction, or other means? As a cognitive phenomenon, the learning process can be studied and the results stated descriptively. Part of such a study would include use of participant-observation; part would include other techniques. Exclusive use of participant-observation, or the music-rationale, might very well prejudice the data, since it is always possible that methods used to teach outsiders (the ethnomusicologist) a musical instrument or type are not the same as those used for group members. Informants, too, can be ethnocentric. A full study of the learning process might include proxemic data, or might add, where appropriate, metaphors, proverbs, similes used by the teacher(s). In each case, however, learning process would be considered to be a cognitive unit which would include the group's conception of how music should be learned as well as who should teach, how and when it should be taught. The three components which I have suggested so far-the aesthetic, the selection/organization (variation), and the learning process-have heretofore received only scant attention. This is by no means true of the fourth component, the sound itself. Ethnomusicologists have not commonly used musicological techniques of analysis in respect to non-Western music. Despite the absence of intersense modalities and a proliferation of views concerning analysis, however, there are ethnomusicologists who are at least indirectly indebted to musicology for part of their theory, in that (like musicology) they employ what anthropologists would call trait lists. Nettl (1956), Kolinski (1964), Boiles (1966), Merriam (1967), and Lomax (1968) employ different kinds of trait lists, but each has 249</page><page sequence="32">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS developed a set of categories which he considers to be significant. Music is then considered according to these categories. Both the trait lists and musicological analysis deal with static descrip- tions, based upon preconceived categories. This type of theoretical orientation has led to Seeger's repeated calls for what he terms 'logic': If we are to use the term "logic" to designate the musical device that results in or characterizes the inner order of music as known to its makers, this must be in a sense consistent with its use in designating the speech-device that results in or characterizes the inner order of speech as known to its makers. (1960:228) More recently, Kaeppler, McLeod, Boiles, Black, myself and others, have leaned heavily on linguistic theory in the analysis of music. The trans- formational model and semiotics are only two of the more dynamic models which have been suggested. In each case, however, new and sometimes difficult sets of terminology have been introduced. Although the linguistic approaches are attempting to get away from preconceived categories and trait lists, they are still some distance from native categories and conceptualiza- tions. The difficulty with musicological, trait-list, and linguistic orientations arises in that masses of data must be refined into abstract terms, definitions, and processes. Most of our discussions have tended to concern the inadequacy of these abstractions. Terminologies have proliferated and have become increasingly individualistic. At the same time, our diverse approaches have become more particularistic rather than more general and universal. For example, while Kolinski is talking about heterogenous pendulum, indirect ascent, or wide-centered falling down zig-zags, McLeod is concerned with phrase-markers and others are counting ascending and descending intervals. In terms of a model for music, what we seem to need is a meta- language. What we have, instead, is an overabundance of terminologies, perhaps symptomatic of our level of concern. A meta-language or specialized language used to talk about sound phenomena would probably be more readily adopted by large numbers of scholars if it remained simply a set of symbols, without semantic loading, which developed naturally out of progres- sive discoveries of recurring cognitive categories in specific musical systems. What I am advocating, then, is a return to the data-in this case, sound as the manifestation of interlocking cognitive maps. This is the logical place to begin. In working with any system of musical sound, the discovery of native categories would become a primary goal. This discovery accomplished, the meta-language would arise out of the second, or analytic, level. This second level would seek to avoid any ethnocentric Western concepts or any terms 250</page><page sequence="33">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS which might be in any way semantically loaded. Indeed, this is the advantage of employing a meta-language at all. By definition, its symbolisms are less semantically loaded than is normal speech. Further, the model in use is clearly stated in the meta-language and its aims are known from the beginning. If one were to choose a dynamic model, for instance, then the output could be checked against actual practice in order to determine what had been left out of the original model, and hence to refine it. Thus, what we seem to need is a music logic, a rationale, a concep- tualization, or a simple basis for talking to ourselves and to others who may be interested. It seems logical to assume that this basis should have elasticity, in order to encompass the wide diversity of our field of study. It should not be our aim to force musical systems into our tight categories; rather, if our goal is understanding of music in and as culture, we must begin with native categories, raw sound, and clear minds. Our assumption can only be that there is pattern on many levels; our goal can only be to locate that patterning. Finally, our conclusions should be of a kind and nature susceptible to checking, both by our colleagues and with the members of a particular culture from which our information came. TOWARD A NEW RATIONALE: A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE If we are to begin with the data, structured sound as the manifestation of interlocking cognitive maps, a specific example is necessary. For the sake of clarity and unity, I will continue to use Zaodahy!, although the fact that this song is not from my personal collection will limit the number of specific illustrations of certain aspects of this model. The first three components I proposed in the previous section are not demonstrable in this example. I do not have complete information on the aesthetics, range of variation, or learning process among the Vakin'ankaratra. Thus, what we can deal with here is the fourth component, sound. As background information, we know that singing should be in parallel thirds, and that pieces for this particular occasion, the haircutting ceremony, should be voices and valiha. Any form of analysis, using any model, involves the manipulation of symbols. In this model, I would propose a three-fold approach for symbol manipulation: 1) a deductive discovery of the general operative principles of the piece or pieces; 2) an inductive computation of generalizations from particular events and a deductive reconstruction of the particular from the structure of the generalities; and 3) a working hypothesis, generated from the other two steps, which would allow the production and testing of other possible pieces within a given style. In this way, our conclusions about a 251</page><page sequence="34">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS particular piece could be checked by actual events within that piece, actual events within related pieces, by informants, and/or by colleagues. Step 1 In the first step, we would begin with the gross features of the pieces under consideration. After a couple of hearings of a piece, we would jot down an outline of what we suspect to be the general organization of the piece. This might include a diagram of melodic motion, a listing of instruments, or a sketch of rhythmic reiterations. In the case of Zaodahy! these notes might look like the sketches found in models three and eight. The notes would then be put aside. The purpose of the first step is basically to allow a place for the recording of the gross features of a piece. These gross features may well be overlooked if we immerse ourselves from the beginning in the micro-details of particular sound events. It is important, in dealing with what we have called styles, forms, or occasions, that the amount of allowable variation within these be known. Therefore, the recording of gross features for thirty or forty songs (or our full sample if it is less than this number) should begin to give us some idea of the wider parameters with which we are dealing. The results of this first step should be kept separate from the second step. This is done in order to avoid our tentative generalizations having an effect on oui inductive computation of generalities from particular events. If we can keep these two steps separated, they can then serve as a check on one another. The notes for step 1 might look somewhat as follows: 1. melodic motion- -rLL LL_ .Lh1I, _ _ ?2. fns tLLru Thnd _riha 2. instruments-voice and valiha 3. general observations- dialogue of valiha/voice patterns? 252</page><page sequence="35">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS phrases = initial upbeat? skip upward in pitch? is tremolo patterned? tempo seems even range is about two octaves three repetitions of larger pattern ending signal = shout of singer? This process should be repeated for each piece in the sample, partic- ularly if the sample does not exceed thirty or forty pieces. The actual number of pieces listened to in this manner will, of course, vary. It should not exceed the point at which the hearer begins to listen to micro-details. Step 2 This aspect of symbol manipulation involves an inductive computation of generalities from particular events, Before the second step can be accom- plished, some form of transcription is probably necessary. Given transcriptions and recordings of a number of songs within a sample area, we then proceed song by song. A determination of pitches and durations used could be made, and plotted for co-occurrence. For example, we would want to know if a particular pitch or duration (or both) is to be found only at the beginning, end, or internally within the piece, section, or subsection. That is, given the parameters of our sets of pitches and durations, what sounds, or rhythmic units, or durations, or combinations may be of significance? This approach resembles models three, six, and seven, but represents a departure from them in two ways: 1) here, it is assumed that the contextual position of pitches or durations may be significant or indicative; 2) I strongly feel that pitches should be expressed in non-relative, formal terms where they do not coincide with the Western system of notation. For example, in looking at pitches, the models previously cited employ counts of ascending and descending intervals. In examining the piece under current consideration, the resulting interval table would be:11 Asc. Desc. m2 4 12 M2 27 45 m3 1 M3 1 1 4 8 253</page><page sequence="36">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS This is, as previously mentioned, a static table. It carries only minimal information. To make it more useful, I would suggest several alterations and additions. First, it might (or might not, in some instances) prove helpful to count the number of reiterations in a piece. Second, the interval and reiteration counts should be considered in terms of possibly significant relationships. For instance, this piece begins with a series of ascending fourths; an examination of the positioning of all ascending fourths should be made. In addition to an interval table containing positional information, it is necessary to create a durational table. This second tabulation should contain both durations and their contexts. A third table should then be made, which combines the first two.12 At the same time, we would apply the process outlined in model eight to discover distinctive features indicating the beginning and/or ending of sections, subsections, and phrases. This process should be repeated for every piece in the sample, with variations noted. The resultant generalizations could then be stated in skeletal form, using the following system: - means equal to or same as + means simultaneous elements, which, taken together, con- stitute the item on the left-hand side of the -- sign () means optional elements (not found in all pieces in a sample) [ ] means that there are several possible elements, but one must be chosen / means "in the environment or context of" #_ # designates the unit under immediate consideration (eg. piece, style, phrase) In this case, we have only one piece, so that is the unit under immediate consideration: #Piece# - silence/pattern/silence We are making the assumption that there is pattern within the piece. We then assume that pattern is composed of several elements. For example: pattern - duration + pitch + emphasis We may well want to include other elements here. These elements are then broken down into their constituent parts, one at a time: duration J., J . ^ , . J pitch - 13 + timbre + ordering 254</page><page sequence="37">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS emphasis - higher decibel count, marked in trans- cription by &gt; These, in turn, are broken down further, where possible: timbre [vaoice voice - 2 singers + // 3rds Alternately, we might prefer to conceptualize the occurrence of voice and valiha within the piece. Since the valiha is playing when the voice is silent, our statment might look as follows: timbre -- valiha (voice) This does not mean that the voice part is optional; merely, the voice does not appear constantly, whereas the valiha does. Another possibility would be to include the concept of silence: timbre - valiha + svice If we do feel that silence is important, we may wish to include it elsewhere, or to change the left portion of this statement from "timbre" to "patterning" or some other word. We may even feel the necessity of saying: Piece - [sOund] + patterning or Piece - [sound /patterning PsilenceJ or #Piece# -- silence/sound/silence sound -- pattern + timbre pattern - redundancy + entropy etc. If this portion of my analysis begins to sound somewhat simplistic and arbitrary, it is intentionally so. It is arbitrary only insofar as it allows for the proposal of various hypotheses which may or may not work. In each case, an hypothesis must be tested against the actual music under consideration. It must also, where possible, be tested against the informants' cognitive map. It is to be expected that a large number of these hypotheses will prove to be wrong or not useful, and will be discarded. This method is also deliberately simplistic. We are not tied into any preconceived set of assumptions about musical intervals, components, or traits, yet we are perfectly free to use any traditional concepts we may want to include. Rather, we are using a small set of conventional symbols which allow 255</page><page sequence="38">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS the simple notation of complex ideas about a body of sound-data. Using these symbols, we can quickly sketch out a series of possibilities and approaches to see which may be the best in a given instance. Statements proceed from the general and abstract to the specific and concrete. Prior to making statements, however, background work proceeds from the specific to the general, with constant testing of hypotheses at every level. Cognitive data from informants should be incorporated wherever possi- ble, and must be distinguished from scholarly assumptions. For example, if we are working at the level of #piece#, before making a series of statements we will have to look at possible constituent parts of #piece# in many different ways. We might begin by identifying phrases both by conventional methods and employing clues gleaned from informants, and then proceed to larger sections, or work with text vs. music if appropriate. Only after a series of low-level assumptions have been tested are we ready to make statements. The statements, then, represent a descending series of non-discarded hypotheses. As our statements become more and more specific, it is logical that there would be an increasing number of optional aspects. This is probably particularly true at the level of specific pitches and their contexts, pitch patterns, chords, or rhythmic patterns. How are we to know, for instance, given a melodic line FGAGA , what to expect next? In Western music, we might well expect BABC# (FGA GAB ABC#), but certainly other arrange- ments are possible and even probable. In Zaodahy!, we can say of the voice part: pitch pattern- - skip/section beginning -reiteration skip i / later phrase LstepwiseJ descent / beginning The hypothesis of this diagram is that pitch pattern may be indicated by several possibilities. Reading inward from the first set of square brackets, we are presented with two main ideas: that the pitch pattern may have an initial skip at the beginning of a section, while later phrases within a section do not. This then potentially indicates a strophe, in which patterns with an upward skip alternate with others. Other phrases within a strophe may begin with a reiteration or a descent. This descent might either be a downward or stepwise skip. This is a preliminary statement, based on only one set of indicators; it ignores rhythmic features, and the presence of an anacrusis in many phrases. Incorporating the anacrusis, the following statement is made possible: 256</page><page sequence="39">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS strophe pattern -- anacrusis/skip/section beginning (anacrusis)/ reit. / skip i L / L[stepwise descent elsewher Both the anacrusis and the upward skip occur sporadically throughout the piece. Thus, on the basis of present evidence, it is still impossible to indicate the exclusive environments of those elements which indicate the boundaries of the strophe. Thus, the next logical step is to examine the end of those units suspected to be strophes, to see if the indicators may be found there. If indicators are not to be found either at the beginning or the end of any suspected unit, it is probably not a unit at all, and serious re-examination, with other hypotheses, is necessary. In this case, however, the end of a strophe can be postulated, although not proven, because of the presence of a reiterative sequence. What makes this piece most interesting, from this point of view, is that there appears to be a mistake in it. The second "strophe" differs sufficiently from the first and third (see ms. 12) that no perfect pattern exists. Further, pitches occur in this measure which are abnormal enough to cause several of the previous models to display severe irregularities. This brings up the problem of the ideal performer/hearer vs. empirical performance practice. If we include this variant as a possible version, and then use the model to generate other versions, we may be creating more mistakes. If, on the other hand, we choose to leave it out, on the grounds that it does not follow the pattern we think we see, we are ignoring the only data we have. There are two possible solutions to this problem, if we choose not to ignore the data. Given the opportunity, we can ask a performer if he/she made a mistake. The performer may not wish to admit to making a mistake; to do so could be culturally impossible. But with the assistance of audience reaction, a larger sample, or culturally defined statements about music the problem can be solved. Here, the utility of this type of hypothesis becomes apparent. Since the model is elastic and hypothetical (and not sacred), and easy to use, it can be checked in the field. Lacking the contextual data, the problem could only be solved with an extremely large sample. Step 3 Step three should involve a careful comparison of the insights from both step 2 and step 1. Just as the hypotheses in step 2 were tested against the 257</page><page sequence="40">HERNDON: ANALYSIS: HERDING SACRED COWS data, so should step 2 be tested against step 1, and vice versa. By this means, any weaknesses or omissions in the second step will be exposed. In this instance, the second step will have to be redone. The first step suppositions included the possibility of a dialogue between the valiha and voice patterns, which was ignored in the hypotheses of the second step. Simply beginning by making a diagram of the relationship of hypothesized phrase units of valiha and voice, and placing them in tentative strophe patterns, it becomes apparent that, while each pattern is different, an alternation of valiha alone vs. valiha plus voice is a major characteristic of the beginning of the proposed strophe. Other observations could be checked in the same way. This is not meant to be a total explication of this piece. Rather, it is intended only as a vehicle for the demonstration of a method. Traditional transformational grammarians will be unhappy with this approach, since it implies that the system is not one of the replication of base rules. Further, the use of such a model as a hypothetical device runs counter to the rigidity of Chomskyian approaches. It should therefore be pointed out that the model demonstrated here is not a transformational grammar. Rather, it is a variety of abstract thinking derived from set theory and basic scientific method. Like all scientific theory, this form of model-making is a free good, until such time as some variety of the model (including a set of rules for making the model) is found to be more satisfactory than others. The only prerequisite of model-making in any form is that it should be tested against reality. The display given in this paper has deliberately avoided a number of vital, yet minute, details. This is not to imply that such detail should not be included. A final description of any musical system would naturally include rules for melodic motion, alternatives of rhythmic patterning, and so forth. This model is capable of dealing with units at any level of discretion. As a descriptive/generative model, it can be subjected to tests on at least two levels. First, each hypothesis can be tested against the material at hand, as illustrated above. Second, a final model which includes all the musical information can be used to generate new pieces. These can then be tested against the sample, as well as by the informants, for validity. Since the model is a derivative of set theory, it is designed to deal with congeries, rather than lists. Since it is a generative model, it is designed to deal with structure and process at the same time, The implication, then, is synthetic rather than analytic, and hypothetico-inductive rather than hypothetico-deductive. The one dangerous assumption in the model is this: that music is patterned. FOOTNOTES 1.
