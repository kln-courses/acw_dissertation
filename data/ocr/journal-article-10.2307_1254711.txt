<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME NOTES ON HOMERIC FOLK-LORE. BY W. CROOKE. (Read at Meeting, 15th May, 1907.) IN this paper I propose to deal with some of the folk- lore and folk-tales to be found in the Homeric poems, and it is not my intention to join, except indirectly, the mellay of the Unitarians,-those who, like Mr. Lang, con- tend that the Iliad and Odyssey are the work of a single writer,-and the Separatists, or, as they used to be called, the Chorizontes, represented by Mr. Leaf. But the study of the folk-lore and folk-tales of Homer is so closely connected with the problem of origins that it is impossible to pass by this controversy in silence. As students of tradition and romance our sympathies are probably on the side of the old-fashioned view which attributes both epics to a single writer. The arguments in its favour have been forcibly stated by Mr. Lang in his recent book.' In the first place, he has made a well-timed protest against the "analytical reader," "the literary entomologist," as he has recently been profanely called. "The poet," he justly remarks, "is expected to satisfy a minutely critical reader, a personage whom he could not foresee, and whom he did not address." He accepts the statement of Mr. Leaf that the epics were "Court poems. They were composed to be sung in the 1 Homer and his Age, in continuation of his earlier work, Homer and the Epic.</page><page sequence="2">Some Notes on Homeric Folk-Lore. 53 palaces of a ruling aristocracy . . . the poems are aristo- cratic and courtly"; they are in no sense ballads or folk-song. This fact, as will be suggested later on, tends to explain some curious omissions, and the reticence which the poet displays regarding ideas and traditions which must have been within his knowledge. Any one who has had personal experience of such Court poets, like the Bhats, who are the singers and panegyrists of the aristocracy of India, will easily understand why the poems contain the inconsistencies on which the Separatists have laid special stress. It is most improbable that the epics were reduced to writing in the age during which they were composed, and it seems quite certain that the audience which heard portions of them recited in the great hall of a palace troubled itself little about the contradictions which impress the modern critic, even if these attracted attention. Mr. Lang, again, has done good service in showing that the Iliad has a well-developed plot, and he adduces weighty arguments to prove that the Doloneia, or Tenth Book, forms a necessary part of it. He also, with much ingenuity, displays the consistency of the character of Agamemnon throughout the Iliad. He argues that both epics represent the culture, customs, and art of a single age. In particular, the methods of disposal of the dead have supplied large materials for controversy. This question seems to be placed out of court by his remark that the people of Australia and Tasmania practise, or did practise, every conceivable way of disposing of their dead.' I have lately had occasion to consider this question with special reference to India. Here we find no uniformity of practice. Inhumation, cairn burial, crouched burial, burial in shaft graves, exposure to beasts and birds, disposal on platforms, and various forms of cremation, are some of the many modes which prevail 1 Homer and his Age, 95.</page><page sequence="3">54 Some Notes on Homeric Folk-Lore. among tribes not ethnically distinct, and possessing a fairly uniform degree of culture. Further, we find these customs varying under our very eyes-forest tribes who used to bury their dead adopting cremation when they come under Brahman influence, and Hindus converted to Islam or Christianity replacing cremation by inhuma- tion. Rites of this kind, in short, seem to be liable to constant modification, and provide no safe criterion for deciding the relative ages of poems like the epics. The facts thus collected seem to indicate unity of age and authorship of the Iliad. The relation of the Iliad to the Odyssey is a much more difficult question. I do not pretend to offer an opinion on the arguments based on archaeology and philology; but I am inclined to think that the linguistic differences in the two poems, of which a catalogue has been prepared by that great scholar, Mr. Munro, have not been fully met by Mr. Lang. From the point of view of religion, again, Professor Lewis Campbell has given a long list of the "obvious differences" between the standpoint of the two poems;1 and the same view has been adopted by Professor Gilbert Murray,2 both critics being deeply impressed by the splendour of Homer's poetry. Mr. Lang's main answer to these arguments seems to be that they do not fit in with Mr. Leaf's scheme of breaking up the Iliad into "cantos."3 Another set of arguments against the unity of the two poems has been produced by Mr. Hall,4 who points out that whereas in the Iliad the Dorians are of no account among the Greek tribes, in the Odyssey they appear to have reached the end of their migrations; that in the Iliad the process of the withdrawal of the Phoenicians from the Aegean seems to have begun, in the Odyssey they appear to have disappeared from Greece, and SReligion in Greek Literature, 84 ff. 2History of Ancient Greek Literature, 33 iff.- 3 Op. cit. 231 f. 4The Oldest Civilisation of Greece, 42, 236, 246, 258, 269.</page><page sequence="4">Some Notes on Homeric Folk-Lore. 55 are found trading more especially outside Greek waters; that the knowledge of Italy shown in the Odyssey points to a later date; and that local politics in the Egyptian delta fix the date of the raid of Odysseus I at the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century B.C. Mr. Lang is at his best in demonstrating that the schemes for the dislocation of the Iliad into lays are impracticable and self-contradictory. The Separatist theory, in short, involves at least two serious difficulties: first, that, assuming the Menis or Wrath of Achilles, the " kernel" of the poem, as Mr. Leaf calls it, to be the work of a writer whom we may call Homer, there must have been, in or about the same age, at least two or three equally great poets who were content to merge their personalities in his, or were identified with him; secondly, that if the present arrangement of the epic is the work of a later editor, it is a mystery how a writer of such genius as his must have been could have left the discrepancies and difficulties which at once attract the attention of the modern critic. The result of the whole investigation seems to be that we may provisionally accept the Iliad, with certain later additions, as the work of a single hand, while the Odyssey probably comes from a different and later writer. " The poems," says Professor Campbell, "are a treasure-house of things new and old, preserving some relics of an immemorial past like flies in amber, while bearing on their surface all the gloss of novelty." 2 In studying part of the large mass of literature devoted to this controversy it occurred to me that if arguments for and against the unity of the epics can be based on considerations like those of armour, the use of bronze and iron, customs of disposal of the dead, and similar considerations to which Mr. Lang's recent book is largely devoted, it might be possible to apply a similar test Od. xiv. 259. 2 0. cit. 54-</page><page sequence="5">56 Some Notes on Homeric Folk-Lore. dependent on the provenience of the Sagas, Marchen, and folk-lore incidents which appear in the poems. If, for instance, the "kernel" of the Iliad was composed on Greek soil, and was subsequently extended by an Ionic poet, we would expect that some indications of this would appear in the folk-lore. So that if taking the scheme of arrangement of the "cantos" in the Iliad, as proposed by Mr. Leaf, and comparing these with the Odyssey we could show that there is anything like a stratification of belief or tradition, and that this cor- responds with the suggested divisions of the poems, we should have an argument of some importance in disproof of the unity of authorship. I hope that in making this investigation I shall not lay myself open to the sarcastic comment of a recent writer, who, reviewing the work of the Separatists, remarks that "we feel as if we were assisting at the midnight adulteration of some new brand of sugar behind a grocer's counter." '1 I trust that the reverence in which I hold the poems will save me from such a charge. In considering the folk-lore and folk tales I shall comment occasionally on any result of this scrutiny which seems of any value, leaving the references in the notes to this paper to speak for themselves. I may say at once that the investigation, for reasons which I will suggest later on, has led to no definite result.2 To return to the sources of the poems-attempts have also been made to discriminate the evidence of foreign influence, of the knowledge of savagery and of lands beyond the Hellenic area, which appears in the epics. For instance, in the Iliad alone we find a reference 1 Edinburgh Review, cci. 210. 2The references follow Leafs scheme as given in his Iliad, Ist ed.

The Odyssey is said to show a wider outlook in the direction of Sicily and Italy; but it exhibits no extension of knowledge towards the Propontis and Euxine, while the information possessed by the writer of the Iliad of the Troad and of the peoples of Asia Minor is no longer to be ttiaced.2 On the other hand, the Iliad knows of the Central African Pygmies, and the tale of the Laestrygonians in the Odyssey seems to point to an acquaintance with the Vikings or their predecessors of northern Europe. How far this may be due to the difference of subject in the two poems is a question for careful consideration. Marks of Semitic influence, again, have been traced in the epics. An instance of this will be suggested later on in connexion with the Saga of Bellerophon. To this source has also been attributed the reference to the rain- bow as a sign; 3 that to Iris as a winged goddess, unique in the poems ;4 the mention of a flood as a punishment for wickedness; 5 and of the palm tree at Delos.6 It has been the habit to attribute Homer's knowledge of Western Mediterranean folk-tales, like those of the Cyclops and Atlas, to Phoenician influence. But it is now certain that the Mycenaean culture was of home growth, and that it cannot be assigned to a non-Greek race, like the Phoenicians. The connexion of the Phoen- icians with the Persian Gulf is now generally dis- credited; 7 and from the Tel-el-Amarna records it is clear that as early as 1400oo B.C. Babylon was the dominant power in Western Asia, and that its civilisation passed 11. i. 268 [i.]; ii. 743 [iv.]; Geddes, Problem of the Homeric Poems, 69, 244. 2Monro, Odyssey, ii. 337. 1 I1. xi. 28; xvii. 548 : [both in v.]. 4 1. viii. 398 [iii.

The discoveries in Crete, again, imply the existence of a great sea power in the Aegean as early perhaps as the second millennium before Christ; and in this way the sites which, according to M. Berard, were associated with the Mirchen of the Odyssey-the city of Alcinous in a west Corfiote site, the island of Calypso in that of Peregil near Ceuta, the cave of the Cyclops at Cumae-must have become known to the Greeks at a period much earlier than is usually supposed, and independently of information from Phoen- ician mariners. Again, in dealing with the question of Semitic influence on early Greek beliefs, it must not be forgotten that, as Mr. A. J. Evans points out,' while it may be admitted that it may have left traces, as Egypt certainly did, on the externals of Mycenaean worship, there was an underlying race-connexion between the pre-Hellenic population of Greece and its islands and the Anatolian region. "The pure Semite is, in fact, difficult to find in Anatolia or Palestine," and "in Cilicia and northern Syria he has largely assimilated elements belonging to that old Ana- tolian stock of which the Carians and the Cilicians stand out as the leading representatives, and which was itself linked on by island stepping-stones to pre-historic Greece." The suggestion, then, of direct borrowing from oriental sources must be reconsidered in the light of recent historical and ethnographical research. In dealing with folk-tradition in the epics nothing is perhaps more remarkable than what may be called the reticence of the poet. A singer of lays before a courtly audience, he knows that his hearers will take little interest in the rude peasant cults. Dionysus he regards as an outsider, received with hostility, and if he was the successor of a village god the poet makes no mention of him. If Homer was a native of the Greek mainland he must have 1Journal Hellenic Studies, xxi. 131.</page><page sequence="8">Some Notes on Homeric Folk-Lore. 59 been familiar with the coarse archaic cults, which are embalmed for us in the pages of Pausanias, but he carefully avoids all mention of them. Demeter is referred to in the Iliad, but she hardly ranks as an Olympian goddess. She is spoken of as the wife or mistress of Zeus; but there is no mention of a child born to the pair, and only once, in the Odyssey, is a personal legend told of her, when she yields to her love of lason, and lies with him in the thrice- ploughed field 1-" one of the lovely earth-born myths that crop up now and again in Homer, telling of an older simpler world, of gods who had only half emerged from the natural things they are, real earth-born flesh-and-blood creatures, not splendid phantoms of an imagined Olympian pageant."2 As the Indian Sitd sprang from a furrow, we recognise in the myth the familiar story of the Sacred Marriage, which attributed to the union of the Earth goddess with her male partner, the fertility of the soil. The representation of this in dramatic form was an important incident in the Mysteries, and was described in a passage of splendid poetical imagination, where Hera beguiles Zeus to couch with her on the crest of Gargaros.3 It is equally remarkable that we have no mention of the serpent cult. We have two snake portents, the snake devouring the sparrows and the bird bearing a snake;4 a snake of cyanus adorns the breastplate of Agamemnon ; 5 we hear of a dragon fed on poisonous herbs, of a deadly water-snake, and Alexandros starts back as one who sees a serpent in a mountain glade.6 But of a snake cult we hear nothing, and this in spite of the fact that it might have been connected with two personages to whom the 1 Od. v.

He knows of Erechtheus, to whom Athene gave a resting-place in her rich sanctuary. But both he and Pausanias are reticent about the sacred serpent which, according to Herodotus, abode there.2 He also knows of Asklepios, the great healer, who in his view is not a deity, but a man with mortal sons who learned their craft from him, and he is called "the blameless leech," an epithet never applied to a god.3 And yet the poet says nothing of his snake, although, as Dr. Frazer shows,4 it is tolerably certain that Asklepios was originally nothing more or less than a serpent, which at a later time was transformed into an anthropomorphic figure with a serpent symbol. It is equally remarkable that the poet carefully selects certain legends for treatment and discards others. His silence, in short, means nothing in connexion with his knowledge of cultus or folk-lore. In some cases doubtless the legend was developed after his time by the later epic writers and tragedians. But he certainly knew some of the stories although he pays little attention to them. Thus of the famous tale of Jason and the Argonauts he tells us little, except in one passage in the Odyssey.5 While relating the legend of the Symplegades or Wandering Rocks, he men- tions incidentally that only one ship of all that sail on the sea, even Argo that is in the minds of all, ever passed that way; and even her the waves would have cast upon the mighty rocks had not Hera, for love of Jason, passed her through. We are told, again, that Euneus, whom Hypsipyle bore to Jason, supplied the Achaeans with wine, and it was apparently he who bought Lykaon as a slave, and the ransom of Lykaon was the silver cup which he gave to Patroclus.6 Of Medea there is no record in the poems, unless she be identical with Agamede, the daughter of Augeias, who, like Medea, was a grand-daughter of Helios, 111. ii. 547 [iv.]; Od. vii. 81. 2 Pausanias, i. 26, 5 ; Herod. viii. 41.

If the poet was familiar with the tale, it is strange that he does not refer to it; for it abounds in excellent epic material. Thus the incident of the cauldron in which she induced the daughters of Pelias to boil their father in order to restore his youth appears in European folk-lore in the story where Christ or St. Peter, or the Devil, wanders through the world in disguise, and restores an old man to youth or a dead person to life by boiling him in a kettle or roasting him in a forge; a bungler, generally a blacksmith, tries to perform the same trick and fails.2 Like this is the Indian tale of Chyavana, who is restored to youth by bathing under the advice of the Asvins, and the wide cycle connected with the Well of Life, which revives even the ashes of the dead.3 There is, again, in the Medea Saga, the fatal wedding-robe which consumes the bridegroom, and this in the German story is made of sulphur and pitch.4 The yoking of the fire- breathing bulls and the sowing of the dragon's teeth appear in the Kalevala in the form of the field of serpents which Ilmarinen must plough before he can win his bride.5 Lastly, Medea's slaughter of the children points to the fact that she is originally a divinity, probably of Semitic origin, closely associated with Hera, and that the sacrifice of children was part of the archaic ritual at her shrine.6 Of the famous tale of Philoktetes, again, Homer tells us only that he lay in sore pain at Lemnos, where the 111. xi. 740 [iv.]. 2Grimm, Household Tales, i. 312 f. ; Ralston, Russian Folk Tales, 57 f.

Achaeans left him sick of a grievous wound from a deadly water snake; that he returned home in safety, and that he alone surpassed Odysseus in archery?. Though the use of poisoned arrows was familiar to the poet, we do not hear of them in connexion with the hero. So with Melampus, a notable figure in Greek folk-lore, who was endowed with prophetic power, who first prac- tised the art of medicine and established the cult of Dionysus in Greece. Of him the poet records two different traditions;2 but we are not told that he knew the language of birds, and that he was warned to leave his house by hearing the wood-worms say that the roof-beam was well nigh eaten through. In this he resembles the Norse Heimdall, who had an ear so fine that he could hear the grass growing in the meadows and the wool on the backs of the sheep. The same tale of semi-divine prescience of coming disaster is told of Gauhar Shah, a modern Hindu saint.3 There is perhaps no tale better adapted to romantic treatment than that of Admetus and his devoted wife, Alkestis. But of her all we learn from Homer is that she was fair among women, the most lovely of the daughters of Pelias, and bore Eumelus, the charioteer to Admetus.' We hear nothing of Oenone, or of the Apples of the Hesperides, which appear in Celtic legend and in the Arabic tale of Ala-ud-din.5 Lastly, Homer tells us little of Herakles, save that many labours were imposed upon him by a man inferior to himself We learn only of the fetching of the Dog of the Underworld, which the poet does not name.6 And yet Herakles has a widespread 111. ii. 716 ff.

In the plays we may learn what are the questions that interest Shakespeare most profoundly and recur to his mind with most insistence ; we may note how he handles his story, what he rejects and what he alters, changing its purport and fashion; how many points he is content to leave dark; what matters he chooses to decorate with the highest resources of his dramatic art, and what he gives over to be the sport of triumphant ridicule; how in every type of character he emphasises what most appeals to his instinct and imagination, so that we see the meaning of character more plainly than it is to be seen in life . . . how dare we complain that he has hidden himself from our knowledge ? "12 Let us now consider some of the folk-lore in the epics. In dealing with Homeric Animism it is hard to say how much represents actual belief and how much metaphor; and its occurrence in what are supposed to be the oldest portion of the poems may be due to the superior energy and imagination of the older writer. Thus, a stone is called "stubborn" or "relentless" in not quite the earliest portions of the Iliad, and also in the Odyssey.3 At times a distinctly human emotion is ascribed to inanimate nature: the earth laughs or groans, the sea rejoices or rouses the Argives, in the earliest as well as in the latest cantos.' The river Scamander waxes wroth in heart in the "kernel" IPausanias, ii. 35, 5; Miller, Dorians (E.T.) i. 373; Frazer, Adonis, Attis, Osiris, 12, 35, 41, I I8 if. 2Shakespeare, 8. 311. iv. 521 [ii.

In the same fashion waves and shores bellow, and the sea is prescient of a storm.2 The belief in birth from rocks and trees, which is probably mere rhetoric, appears twice in the Menis, once in the Odyssey.3 Lastly, it is impossible to detect any stratifica- tion in the mention of weapons craving for slaughter, which is often quoted as an instance of Animism.4 In the Ramayana " the great bow embossed with gold Throbs eager for the master's hold." 5 The spears of the Irish Red Branch champions, we are told, "were regularly seized with the rage for massacre; and then the bronze head grew red-hot, so that it had to be kept in a caldron of cold water, or, more commonly, of black poisonous liquid, into which it was plunged whenever it blazed up with the murder fit."6 To take the cases in which supernatural intelligence and powers of speech are attributed to animals.-Though the horse Arion is mentioned in the Iliad,7 the crude legend of its birth from Demeter and its powers of reason and speech are ignored.8 But we have other instances of these gifted beasts. Antilochus, Achilles, and Menelaus appeal to their horses, and Polyphemus to his ram, throughout the epics,9 and the horses of Achilles weep in sympathy with their lord.'0 This communion of man and beast is common in folk-lore, and the power of understanding beast language is gained in various ways-by eating porridge mixed with I xxi. 136 f.

With these gifted horses which speak and lament the fate of their owner we may compare the Karling legend of Bayard, and Skirnir in the Edda talking to his horse, as Godrun does with Grani after the murder of Sigurd.2 In Persian myth the same power is attributed to the steed of Rustum; in an Irish story the ram speaks to St. Magnenn, as in a Kashmir tale the horse warns his master, the Raja, against his treacherous Wazir; and in the Hindu tale of Vidhusaka, the hero, seeing no means of escape from his trouble, and knowing what his horse had been in a previous birth, bows before him and says: "Thou art a god; a creature like thee cannot commit treason against his lord." On which appeal the horse obeys his master, "for excellent horses are divine beings."3 Another of these sacred Homeric beasts is the boar, which the offended Artemis sends against the garden land of Oineus.4 This reminds us of the mythic swine of Ireland, reared with malice and venom that it might be the bane of the men of Erinn, or the Erymanthian boar slain by Herakles.5 Again, to take the cult of trees-A phrase employed by Homer implies that the earliest temple was a booth of branches,6 and it has been supposed that the same idea is involved in the custom of hanging up the arms of defeated combatants, which appears in the second canto of the Iliad as well as in the Odyssey.7 In the same canto of the I Elton-Powell, Saxo, Intro. lxix. ; Miss Cox, Cinderella, 496 ff.

Iliad we find a reference to the very archaic belief in the grave-tree as an abode for the spirit of the dead man, when the mountain Nymphs plant elm-trees round the barrow of Aetion.1 A similar tale is told of Protesilaus, round whose barrow elm-trees grew; those which faced towards Troy bloomed early and withering fell untimely, like the hero himself, and of Geryon, on whose grave the trees dropped blood.2 We have the same idea in the folk- tales of the grave-trees springing from the corpse and becoming a refuge for the spirit. " Margaret was buryed in the lower chancel, And William in the higher: Out of her breast there sprang a rose, And out of his a briar."3 In Samoa the grave of a chief is called "the house thatched with the leaves of the sandal-wood," in allusion to the custom of planting some tree with pretty foliage near the grave. So in the Celtic tale of Baile and Ailinn the yew and apple trees grew from the lovers' graves and when cut down were made into tablets on which the poets inscribed their pitiful story.' It is only in the Odyssey that we have a vague hint of the equally archaic belief in the birth-tree, if the palm springing at the altar of Apollo which Odysseus saw, refers to the birth-palm under which Leto was delivered.6 It seems equally impossible to discover any stratification of the more primitive religious beliefs in the Iliad. Per- haps the most archaic cultus recorded in the poems is that of Dodonaean Zeus. It is at the supreme crisis 1 II. vi. 419 f. [ii.

The lord of all Pelasgos, and enthroned On frore Dodona's snows; and round thy throne Circle the Sellian seers, for thee devote To feet unwashen, and to bed the earth."' This is in the Menis, but the other two references to Dodona are found in the Odyssey.2 At Dodona, according to Pro- fessor Ridgeway, occurred the first clash of Pelasgian and Achaean, and here Zeus and his shadow-wife, Dione, displaced the old Earth Mother and her dove priestesses.3 Hence we find here a dove cult, which in its earliest stages had no connexion with Aphrodite, but with Zeus, to whom in another passage the doves bring nectar.4 Again, we find at Dodona that Odysseus visits the oracular tree, to learn the counsels of Zeus from the high leafy oak-tree of the god. The notice of this archaic cultus is found not in the Iliad, but in the Odyssey.5 Aeschylus speaks of these prophetic oaks of Dodona, Sophocles of the oak of many voices, and Herodotus tells how "two black doves flew away from Egyptian Thebes, and on alighting at the Dodona oak began to speak with human voice and told them that on this spot should be the oracle of Zeus."6 Such oracular trees, like the burning bush of Moses, the "tree of the augurs," near Shechem, the oak of Moreh, the palm tree of Deborah, are common in the beliefs of the Semites and other races.7 Thirdly, 1 1. xvi. 233ff.

Thus, they were obliged to sleep on the ground, as is the rule with the chief priest of Zinda Kaliana in the Panjab, who must sleep on the ground or on a square bed of grass made on the earth between four posts, a form of primitive asceticism, the idea that ghosts cannot touch the ground possibly aiding in the establishment of the practice.' For the same reason the votaries of Sultan in the Panjab sleep on the ground, not on a bedstead; and in memory, it is said, of the fall of their capital, Chithor, but more probably in obedience to some primitive taboo, the old Rajputs used vessels of clay instead of metal, and slept on straw, while the modern Raja, though he eats off gold and silver, and sleeps on a bed, places leaves beneath the one and straw under the other.2 Apparently for the same reason the Roman Flamen Dialis had the feet of his bed smeared with mud, and the priest of the old Prussian god, Potrimpo, was bound to sleep on the bare earth for three days before he performed sacrifice.3 The custom of the Selloi keeping their feet unwashed presents more difficulty. We have many cases in which the removal of foot-gear in holy places is prescribed, as in the Semitic ritual, probably lest the shoes might become taboo and unfit for future use by contact with the holy ground. The officiant at the Latin Lemuria walked barefoot through the house, possibly on the theory that he thus was unfettered, and there was a special Roman rite, the Nudipedalia, in which barefooted matrons walked in procession in order to prevent drought; while the Egyptian priests, like the modern Kafirs of North India, took off their shoes at the time of sacrifice.3 At I Rose, Pzunjab Census Report, i90o, i.

In the case of the Selloi the rule of keeping the feet unwashed may be a survival of some primitive ascetic ritual, as the Hindu Faqir smears himself with dust or ashes to indicate to all and sundry that he is in a state of taboo, and this may have attracted the attention of the later Greeks by its startling contrast to the elaborate rules of personal purity which marked the officiants of the service of the Olympian gods.2 It is remarkable that the shadowy Dione, the partner of the older Zeus, is mentioned only once in the epics, and that not in the "kernel," but in one of the so-called later additions.3 Two primitive forms of oath appear in the poems-one in connexion with animal victims; the other by the river Styx. The former does not occur, as perhaps we might have expected, in the older cantos.4 The conception of Styx varies in Homer. By one account it is a stream of this world, or at least closely connected with it, because the Titaresios of Thessaly is a branch of it; by another it is a river of the underworld, and a branch of it is Cocytus; elsewhere it is described as a waterfall.5 This oath by Styx is undoubtedly a most primitive rite. In the first place, Dr. Frazer has shown that the fact that a draught of its water is considered deadly, points to the conclusion that it originally represented one of those poison ordeals Maspero, Dawn of Civilisation, I124 ; Robertson, Kafirs of the Iindu-Kusk, 429; Newton, Essays on Art and Archaeology, I56, 178.

Thus in the case of the Aegis, Professor Ridgeway has clearly shown that the Gorgoneion on the shield is but the head of the slain beast whose skin was the raiment of the primitive goddess.4 In the poems it appears in practically all the cantos, and is borne by Zeus, Athene, or Apollo.5 The other magical appliances appear more often in the Odyssey than in the Iliad. In the Iliad we meet the magic strap or girdle of Aphrodite, which seems to have been placed in a loose fold of the robe as a mimetic charm to promote union with the beloved one.6 It some- times seems to stand for the Life Token, as in a Micmac story where a man captures a mermaid by obtaining the hair-string without which she could not live.7 The magical power of the girdle seems, in other cases, to depend on the efficacy of the cord and sacred circle as a charm against evil spirits.

The girdle of Hera has additional protectives in its hundred tassels, which baffle the Evil Eye, and are probably like the pendants found at Mycenae, which seem to represent a common form of amulet.1 The Egyptian kings wore as a protective a special royal girdle, which is like the Bunna-do-At worn by the old Irish kings, and the Brahmanical cord of India.2 Even in the Western Isles of Scotland a girdle of seal-skin is worn to cure sciatica, while one method of becoming a werwolf is to obtain a girdle made of human skin.3 An even closer parallel to the love-girdle of Aphrodite is the magic neck- lace of Frey which fascinates the sons of men.4 The magic wand, the stock implement of all magicians and sorcerers, appears only once in the Iliad, but several times in the Odyssey.5 The Iliad provides examples of those works of art which indicate the magical qualities ascribed to the early metallurgists-the magic tripods of Hephaistos with golden wheels, which of their own motion might enter the assembly of the gods and again return to his house; the magic bellows which work at his bidding; the golden handmaids, " the semblances of living maids, who have understanding in their hearts, voice, and strength." 6 These have their analogues in the Odyssey in the hounds of gold and silver which guard the palace of Alcinous, and the youthful golden torch-bearers, possibly statues,7 which may be com- 1 I. xiv. 161 [iii.]; Schuchhardt, Schliemann's Excavations, i8o. 2 Erman, Life in Ancient Egypt, 60; O'Curry, Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish, iii. 174. 3 Pinkerton, Voyages, iii. 595; Fiske, Myth and Myth-makers, 90. 4 Thorpe, Northern MAythology, i. 33 ; Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, i. 307, ii. 870. 11i. xxiv. 343 (Hermes) [iii.

Friar Orderic tells us that "in the palace of the Great Khan there are many peacocks of gold, and when any of the Tartars wish to amuse their lord, then they go one after another and clap their hands, upon which the peacocks clap their wings and make as if they would dance." This, he shrewdly remarks, must be done either by diabolic art or by some engine working underground; and in another place he tells of vessels of wine which lift themselves to the lips of the drinkers.2 Such, too, were the horse of copper, the hounds, the metal serpent, which the arch-magician Vir- gilius made to clear Rome of evil-doers.3 In the Teutonic legend Thor's hammer comes back of itself into his hand, like an Australian boomerang, and in the hall of Aegi the pitchers of ale brought themselves to the board, the loaves walked in, and the wine poured itself out.4 With these magical works of art may be classed the imperishable clothing which Calypso gives to Odysseus,5 like the invulnerable garment presented by his mother to Oddo in the Eyrbyggia Saga.6 In the same class are the flying sandals of Hermes, golden, divine, which bear him over the wet sea and the 1 Tawney, Katha, ii. 569, i. 350, 390; Griffith, Ramayan, 401. 2 Yule, Cathay and the Way Thither, i. 131, 143; id.

These have their ana- logues in the feather shift of Freyja, and the fairy shoes, the nine-leagued boots of the fairy tales, the Pushpaka or flying throne of Hindu tradition.2 In another form we meet them in the slipper of Cinderella, and the magic shoe of the Chinese story, which the lover shakes when he wishes to summon his absent mistress.3 In a Hindu story the hero wins them from the sons of the Asura Maya, who are represented in European tradition by the two giants in the German tale of the "Crystal Bath."4 It is only in the Odyssey5 that we have an allusion to the treatment by the savage medicine-man, the stopping of bleeding by the recital of a charm, which appears con- stantly in Indian and other folk-lore. In the Ramayana Vrihaspati combines such spells with the use of herbs; the mere passing through the palace of the Hetaira cures the horses' wounds, as Lancelot cures the wounds of Sir Urre of Hungary; and in Celtic folk-lore the magic oint- ment gains its power from the spells pronounced over it.6 The veil, again, is used in a mystic way. In the Odyssey Ino Leucothea gives him the divine veil which saves Odysseus when he wraps it round his breast, the per- sonality of the owner attaching to her clothing, as the might of Achilles is supposed to be transferred to Hector with the arms of Achilles.7 Circe, again, knows the magic ointment.

This is like the ointment of the folk-tales, which makes him who uses it invulnerable, and restores the dead to life; if made of the fat of unbaptised babies, or of seven herbs, each picked on a special day, it gives the witch the power of riding through the air on a broomstick.2 Another variety gives the power of seeing fairies; a third the faculty of invisibility, like the stone which Peredur receives in the Arthurian legend.3 In the Arabian Nights the Merman gives Abdulla an ointment, "wherewith when thou hast anointed thy body, the water will do thee no hurt, though thou should pass the lave of thy life going about in the great deep"; and in another tale of the same collection the Fakir says: "The wonders of this ointment are passing strange and rare. An thou close thy left eye and rub upon the lid the smallest portion of the salve, then all the treasures of the world now concealed from thy gaze will come to sight"-the same ointment, in fact, which the fairies give to the human midwife who attends their wives, and which, if misused, causes blindness.4 This and many other ideas of the same kind are survivals from the time when no one tried to draw the line between medicine and magic. Invisibility, which in folk-lore is ordinarily secured by the use of drugs,-in Dahome by pounding up a baby boy in a mortar,-by a special stone, fernseed, and the like, is in Homer gained by a magic helmet, like that of Hades, which Athene dons that terrible Ares may not behold her.

It is very. improbable that any special plant was in the mind of the poet. The difficulty in digging it perhaps points to the mandrake, that remarkable plant with a myriad mystic virtues, which shrieks as it is drawn from the earth, and of which Pliny tells us that when they intended to take the root, "they took the wind thereof, and with a sword describing three circles round it, they digged it up looking towards the west." Josephus (B.J. vii. 6, 3) says that "a furrow must be drawn round the root until its lower part is exposed, then a dog is tied to it, after which the person tying the dog must get away. The dog then endeavours to follow him and so easily pulls up the root, but dies suddenly instead of his master." 6 1 Thorpe, op. cit. i. 217; Clouston, Popular Tales, i. o9; Lady Guest, Mabinogion, 286; Joyce, Social History, i. 245. 2 1. xv. 668; xx. 444; xxi. 597 Li.]; V. 24, 500 [ii.

Another of these magic drugs is that which Helen learnt from Polydamnia of Egypt, that home of magic and mystery: "But Helen now on new device did stand, Infusing straight a medicine in their wine, That drowning care and dangers, did decline All thought of ill. Who drunk the cup should shed All that day not a tear, no, not if dead That day his father or his mother were, Nor if his brother, child, or chiefest dear He should see murdered there before his face." 1 This drug of forgetfulness is a stock element in the folk-tales. In the Norse legend Grimhild gives a potion, the Ominnis-61ol, to Sigfried, which makes him forget his love, Brunhild, and the same draught she gives to her daughter, Gudrun. We have the Nepenthe of Homer in the "insane herb" eaten by the companions of Sindibad, which some have tried to identify with the oriental hemp. We meet it also in the Arab tale of the "Ensorcelled Prince," and in the Hindu story Koila procures a drug from the dancing-women which causes him to forget his home, his wife, his child, as in the Irish tale the Druids give Cuchulainn the draught of oblivion. In the Chinese purgatory the drink of forgetfulness is adminis- tered by an old beldame, Mother Meng. "Whether they swallow much or little it matters not; but sometimes there are perverse devils, who altogether refuse to drink. Then beneath their feet sharp blades start up, and a copper tube is put down their throats by force, by which they are compelled to swallow some."3 The Greeks had 25, iii. 350; Miss Garnett, Women of Turkey, ii. 2 f.; Hastings, Diction ary of the Bible, iii. 234. 1 Od. iv. 220 ff. 2 Corpus Poet.

So far I have been dealing with some of the many folk-lore incidents which occur in the epics. From what I have said of the provenience of these incidents as illustrated by the references attached to this paper, it will, I think, be found that it is impossible to trace any stratification of these in the various cantos or lays into which some critics divide the Iliad. So far, this may be considered evidence in support of the view that the Iliad and Odyssey belong to a single age, if they are not the work of a single author. But this argument must not be pressed too far. The number of facts is not large enough to base a safe induction upon them. Some ideas would naturally be selected for use by the poet when dealing with special episodes in the story which he selected for treatment. Or, again, it is possible that such incidents may have become part of the stock epic machinery, and be used by one poet after another when dealing with subjects of the same class. W. CROOKE.
