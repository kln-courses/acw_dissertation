<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOLLARDS AND IMAGES: THE DEFENSE OF RELIGIOUS ART IN LATER MEDIEVAL ENGLAND BY W. R. JONES England during the late fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries pro- vided the scene for a debate over the religious uses of art, which, in its literary productiveness if not in its actual results, recalls the great Byzantine Iconoclast Controversy. Not since the Carolingian era, when Christian Europe had been obliged to reconsider its views in response to the challenge posed by Greek Iconoclasts, had the theo- logical, moral, and historical rationale for venerating images been ex- amined with such attention and anxiety. At the earlier time Charlemagne's court theologians, outraged by what they thought was a recrudescence of idolatry among Byzantine iconodules, had condemned the actual worship of images, although they accepted the veneration of the cross and the commemorative and decorative uses of images of the saints.1 Subsequently, the subject did not evoke much concern in the West, which tended to forget the suspicions and hesitations concern- ing images held by the Carolingian theologians. Between the ninth and the fourteenth centuries European Christian art had developed freely and with the general approval of the Church, which showed little inclination to revise arguments concerning the proper use of images worked out centuries before. Those scholars, who occasionally took up the question in the course of discussing other, more pressing matters, were prepared to accept the veneration of images; and they reassured themselves by quoting such hallowed iconodule arguments as Greg- ory I's characterization of images as the bible of the unlearned. Until the fourteenth century the criticism of images was occasional and limited in scope.la Purists like the early Cistercians and Franciscans questioned the wisdom of ornamenting Christian shrines with the con- spicuous symbols of worldly success. After the conversion of the West to Christianity, idolatry of a pagan kind was not a serious nor general problem, although the crudities of folk religion sometimes troubled sophisticated observers. The extreme views of notorious heretics like the Waldensians and Cathars, who rejected the veneration even of the 'Charles Joseph Hefele and H.

JONES cross, never led to a reconsideration of the entire subject of religious art. Further, the acceptance of images by theologians and canonists was reinforced by popular devotional custom. The visitation and venera- tion of images were endorsed as works of merit; and reports of their miracles entered medieval literature and legend. This long period of more or less tacit acceptance was interrupted in the fourteenth century when a generation or two of opponents and defenders of images under- took to examine the fundamental assumptions of Christian iconog- raphy. This "second Iconoclast Controversy" was prompted by the outbreak of the Wyclifite heresy, which questioned, together with sev- eral other traditions of the medieval church, the legitimacy of certain kinds of religious artistry. The criticism of image-worship and similar forms of lay pietism increased during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; but this criti- cism did not necessarily result from heresy nor lead to false belief.2 It was probably the result of a realization of the extent to which certain lay devotional customs fell short of the ideals of the contemporary church. It has been suggested that the "Christo-centric devotionalism" of the later Middle Ages had the effect of popularizing image-worship and of integrating it more fully into the prevailing pietism of the era.3 The proliferation of wall paintings in churches and chapels and the circulation of the little devotional cards, which reproduced the most popular of these images for private use, may have been associated with a growing interest in Christian meditation. Later medieval pietism, which encouraged the laity to resort to such devotional exercises, also provoked objections concerning their indiscriminate and indiscreet use. Professor G. R. Owst, the historian of medieval English homilet- ics, noticed the existence of a body of commentary on images, which appeared to belong neither to the Lollard opposition nor to the ortho- dox defense.4 This third group of authors and preachers constituted the non-heretical critics of images, who denounced the "heathenish" corruptions associated with them, while they accepted their proper use for spiritual and moral edification. In 1356, for instance, Richard Fitz- ralph, archbishop of Armagh and an influential controversialist of the 2Coulton, op. cit., 374-75; Advocates of Reform from Wyclif to Erasmus, ed.

There were other examples of this critical but non-heretical atti- tude toward images, a view which is sometimes difficult to distinguish from Lollard propaganda of the same era. The fourteenth-century homilist, Robert Rypon, sub-prior of Durham, was disturbed by the inaccuracy of some artistic representations of familiar saints;6 and the anonymous author of Dives and Pauper, which appeared in England shortly after 1400, criticized the popular confusion of reli- gious iconography with divinity itself, with the result that some laymen were guilty of idolatry.7 Secular writers of the fourteenth century made the same point.8 Associated with the criticism of specific abuses was the admonition to practice a more evangelical faith, less dependent on the paraphernalia and formalities of worship, and productive of practical acts of charity. Many of the apparent novelties of the Lollard critique of images were, in fact, truisms of contemporary reformist opinion.9 The archheretic Wyclif was moderate in his criticism of images. In his theological works he only occasionally took up the subject, and his views were closer to those of the orthodox critics of images than to the opinions of later Lollards.10 Wyclifs most extensive discussion of images was presented in his treatise on the Ten Commandments-the De mandatis divinis.11 Commenting on the first and second command- ments, he observed that the ancient Hebrews had been forbidden to worship gods other than their own and to make graven images. This prohibition derived from the fact that the Jews were prone to idolatry, that the Incarnation had not yet sanctified human form, and that Christ's birth and life had not created the holy family and his disciples. Images had been gradually introduced, Wyclif noted, toward the end of the Apostolic period, when they were justified as books for the un- learned and as sources of Christian inspiration. Wyclif admitted that 5G. R.

When properly used to excite the religious affections and raise the mind of the wor- shiper to God, they were acceptable and good. When the dead image was itself the object of veneration, however, the Christian was guilty of the pagan sin of idolatria. Wyclif understood the commandment to apply to the heathen, the sorcerer, the Jew, the Saracen, and the heretic-all of whom worshiped false gods-and he saw the prohibi- tion against the making of images as directed against false Christians, who, in an Augustinian sense, lusted after temporalia and worldly sat- isfaction. Wyclif condemned the ignorant and superstitious use of im- ages; and he was especially offended, as were the Lollards of a later time, by the representation of the Trinity in the form of an old man, a youth, and a dove; by the tendency to endow images with magical virtues; and by the crass materialism that sometimes surrounded pil- grimage sites. On a different occasion he observed with considerable regret that "we who call ourselves Christians sin more often in idolatry than do barbarians."12 Wyclif was willing to tolerate images, along with pilgrimages and the veneration of the saints, so long as they were used cum prudencia;13 but he insisted that a distinction be drawn be- tween their proper and improper use. At no time did he advocate their abolition, although he once expressed the wish that Christians might do without them.14 It has sometimes been argued that Wyclifs objections to image-worship became harsher toward the end of his life, but there is no evidence that this was so.15 In his objections to ec- clesiastical ostentation, superstition, and avarice Wyclif was quite con- ventional; and in his critical but tolerant approach to images he was in agreement with other reformers of the medieval church.16 After Wyclif the Lollard attitude toward images was less tolerant, philosophical, and academic; although it differed more in rhetoric and emphasis than it did in message.17 Lollard propaganda appealed in the vernacular to popular emotions and to prejudices of class and status; and, although it did not preach abolitionism, its contempt for richly adorned images and its inflammatory rhetoric provoked sporadic inci- dents of vandalism and arson.18 After Oxford had been purged of Wy- '2Johannis Wyclif, De eucharistia, ed.

Lollard propa- ganda reflected this new attitude in that it was usually anonymous, extremely partisan, and exhibited humanitarian sentiments and social prejudices derived from a sort of medieval "populism," which was ex- tremely distrustful of ecclesiastical privilege and prosperity. Further, Lollardy was a program of action for a small but energetic sect of religious revolutionaries, who taxed the ingenuity of both church and state to contain them. Before the end of the fourteenth century the de- fenders of the established devotional practices of the medieval church like Thomas Netter of Walden had become aware of the increased radicalism of Lollardy and of its threat to religious art; and they had begun to muster arguments for the retention of statues and paintings in Christian churches.19 Lollardy after Wyclif was not a systematic body of belief, but, rather, a loose assortment of opinions and attitudes concerning Chris- tianity and its institutions. One of the principal points of heretical be- lief was the criticism of image-worship and one of the most common accusations made against the Lollards was that they despised the cross and images of the saints.20 The debate over religious images could be and often was associated with other doctrinal and liturgical matters, such as pilgrimages and the cult of the saints, which were discussed separately or in works devoted to the whole range of issues separating the two camps. Lollard views on images can, therefore, be extracted from several sources, both particular and general, and of both Wyclifite and orthodox authorship. Among the most familiar and typical of their diatribes against images was the article contained in the Lollard "peti- tion" allegedly introduced into a parliament at Westminister in 1395 but actually circulated as propaganda on the same occasion.21 Several works previously attributed to Wyclif but not of his authorship-an "Apology" of unknown origin;22 the anonymous English commentary "On the Twenty-Five Articles;23" and brief remarks in some of the mini 1328 usque ad Annum 1388, ed.

JONES pieces printed in the Early English Text Society edition of Wyclifs English works-reflect later Lollard opinion on images.24 Relatively rare is the Lollard sermon, quoted in part by Professor Owst from Bri- tish Museum Additional Manuscript 24202, fols. 26-28v, which was entirely devoted to the subject.25 Lollard opinions can also be ex- tracted from the works of well-informed opponents like Thomas Net- ter and Bishop Reginald Pecock, who composed detailed refutations of the Wyclifite heresy, and from the depositions, confessions, and oc- casional statements of accused heretics. A literal reading of the Decalogue provided the Lollards with an obvious and compelling weapon against the adoration of graven and painted images, and they seized upon it. They tended to define most acts of image-worship as idolatria-the pagan superstition of worship- ing created things rather than God under the misapprehension that such things possessed the sanctity and therapeutic powers that were actually God's alone. Both parties agreed that idolatry was detestable and wrong, but the church denied the Lollard allegation that the ven- eration of Christian images was a heathen survival. For their part, however, the Lollards were unconvinced that the average Christian made the necessary distinction between the physical object and the supernatural force it represented, and, in conformity with their highly selective Scriptural fundamentalism, insisted on the continuity of the prohibition of image-worship from the old law to the new. The Lol- lards were not wholesale abolitionists and were usually willing to ac- cept the reverence paid an unadorned crucifix; but they rejected richly ornamented images, crude anthropomorphic representations of the Trinity, and the actual worship of created things. Such things were, they said, simply "graued gods and mawmets," for which there was no Scriptural warrant, but, rather, irrefutable proof of their unacceptabil- ity.26 During his examination for heresy before Archbishop Thomas Arundel, the Lollard preacher William Thorpe recalled that he had argued that the makers of images, as well as those priests who con- fessed them, were alike guilty of sin;27 and William Woodford, an English iconodule, noted that if image-worship were idolatrous, then 24The English Works of Wyclif hitherto Unprinted, ed.

Lollard belief in the ineffectualness of images was exhibited in their recommendation, which was dramat- ically applied on a few occasions, of using them for fuel: "Certis, these ymagis of hemselfe may do nouther gode ne yvel to mennis soulis, but thai mygtten warme a mannes body in colde, if thai were sette upon a fire."29 On the other hand, there were accusations of fraud, deception, and diabolical trickery. Even an orthodox critic like Archbishop Fitz- ralph insinuated that the keepers of shrines and pilgrimage sites manufactured miracles in order to milk the gullible.30 The opponents of images sometimes claimed that whatever supernatural effect they seemed to possess was the result of diabolical connivance, and that the devil used such things to mislead true believers.31 One Lollard source concluded flatly: "The worschiping of cursid idols is the bikynning, cause, and ende of all iuel."32 The usual Lollard view of images was, however, that they were absolutely impotent and devoid of all real in- fluence on human or natural events. Sometimes the Lollards turned the accusation of heresy against the church by criticizing the unhistorical and unchristian decoration of images with the trappings of worldly wealth. Very close to Wyclif in its tolerance and qualified acceptance of images was the list of twelve articles, which the Lollards circulated during the session of the Parlia- ment of 1395. The tenth article of this list of Lollard "conclusions" condoned the veneration of "ymagis maad truli that representen verili the pouert and the passioun of Jhesu Crist and othere seyntis," but re- jected as "of opin errour or of opin eresie agens cristene feith" those "false ymagis that representen worldli glorie and pride of the world as if Crist and othere seyntis hadden lyuid thus."33 An anonymous Lol- lard author, writing "On the Twenty-Five Articles," likewise re- marked that expensively caparisoned statuary "bene false ymagys and bokis of heresye worthi to be destroyed34;" and still another heretic turned Pope Gregory I's words around when he characterized such art 28Brit.

R. JONES as a "liber erroris populo laicali."35 Though they were willing to ac- cept the presence in a church of a "poor cross" as a reminder of Christ's sacrifice and humble images of the saints as guides to piety, the Lollards were outraged by expensive statuary, which, they said, encouraged venality and misinformed the people as to the historical simplicity and humility of Apostolic Christianity.36 The Lollards took pride in what they characterized as the spiritual quality of their faith, which they contrasted with the alleged exter- nalism, superficiality, and ritual conformism of orthodox religion. The literature of Lollardy frequently alluded to the heightened spirituality or "more gostly" character of Wyclifism. A Lollard sermon quoted by Owst made this point when it asserted: "And now men shulden be more gostly and take lesse hede to siche sensible signes.... For oure lord god dwellis by grace in gode mennes soulis."37 An anonymous English author, who has been characterized as showing Lollard sym- pathies, stressed the priority of the intangible and abstract in the Chris- tian hierarchy of values: "For we schulden knowe bi resoun that thingis that ben unsensible passen in goodnesse thingis that ben sen- sible, as helpe that we may not se passith feelinge thingis, and lyf that we may not feele passith feelinge bodies, so god that we may not se pas- sith worldli thingis."38 The same author also described the need for personal conversion, which was a doctrine of Lollardy as well as the orthodox pietism of the era: "inwardli schulden we traueile forto knowe oure god."39 This tendency to spiritualize and internalize was revealed by William Thorpe's characterization of the act of pilgrimage as a life-long religious experience-a sustained act of Christian devo- tion-rather than a single ceremonial gesture;40 and by the Lollard preacher, who criticized pilgrims undertaking their journeys out of simple curiosity rather "than for ony swete devocioun in here soule to god or to the seynt that thei seken."41 Much of this was, of course, simply a more vehement plea for the experiential and affective faith that was also preached by the orthodox evangelists of the period. The Lollards devalued local cult images, which in their view pro- moted idolatry, clerical luxury, and aristocratic avarice, and instead advocated a more abstract and spiritualized conceptualization of divin- ity unconnected with particular shrines and pilgrimage sites. The old local cults appeared to raise the threat of idolatry through their con- fusion of the created symbols of divinity with the divine itself. Lollards 35Fasciculi zizaniorum, 364. 36This qualified acceptance is expressed by William Thorpe in Pollard, op. cit., 133- 34; Arnold, op. cit., III, 463; Forshall, op. cit., 23. 37Owst, Literature and Pulpit, 144. 38Brit.

Before the end of the fourteenth century the orthodox apologist, Roger Dymmock, felt obliged to reply to the Lollard argument that man himself, fashioned in God's image, was a better symbol of divinity and, therefore, merited veneration more than insensible images.46 An anonymous Lollard preacher described the poor as "quicke ymagis of god";47 and Bishop Pecock reported Lollards of his day as saying: "that ech Cristen man is a perfiter and a fuller and a spedier ymage of Crist than is eny stok or stoon graued."48 From this rhetorical juxtaposition of humanity and the physical objects of worship, the Lollards moved toward advocating explicitly humanitarian standards of Christian piety. The Lollard critique of images included the complaint that the de- votional practices of the church entailed the reversal of fundamental Christian values. Pilgrimages, votive-offerings, and the adoration of images represented to them a purely ceremonial conformism that con- travened the original and essential values of Christianity. The author of the Lollard tract, "Of the Leaven of Pharisees," denounced the sub- stitution of ecclesiastical custom and canonical standards of justice for divine commandment and the clergy's tendency to punish broken pil- 42Owst, Literature and Pulpit, 145. 43Pecock, Repressor, I, 194 44The Lollard sermon on images in Brit.

JONES grimage-vows more severely than the infraction of God's own law.49 Another Lollard diatribe, wrongly attributed to Wyclif, ascribed this transvaluation of Christian ideals to satanic influence, which prompted pious laymen to expend their wealth on the adornment of images and the enrichment of prelates rather than in performing works of charity as Christ himself had taught. The superficiality of conventional acts of devotion produced, it was said, both error and waste: "riche men clothen dede stockis &amp; stonys with precious clothis, with gold &amp; silver &amp; perlis &amp; gaynesse to the world, &amp; suffren pore men goo sore a cold &amp; at moche meschefe."50 Since they held man himself to be the truest image of God, the Lollards argued that the most acceptable form of worship would be alms-giving and other socially beneficial works of charity;51 and because of their jaundiced view of pilgrimages, the least the Lollards expected from their abolition was the elimination of the temptations and vices, which, they said, arose from them.52 Wyclif himself had suggested that the veneration of images should be coupled with the instruction of the Christian laity by a dedicated and knowledgeable priesthood;53 and the Lollards maintained the ped- agogical superiority of preaching and reading to the purely visual form of instruction represented by images. William Thorpe said that he had replied to Archbishop Arundel that a worthy and devout priest- hood offered a better model of the Christian life than could be acquired from the study of images.54 The Lollards tended to stress the educa- tional and charitable duties of the clergy to such an extent that Bishop Pecock, in defending the efficacy and validity of images as instructional aids, undertook a careful analysis of the duties of the priesthood, the process of human perception, and the psychology of learning.55 The Lollard penchant for moralizing about art, which they con- demned as promoting luxury, avarice, and vainglory, was the product not only of their preference for the simpler religion, which they thought they saw depicted in Scripture, but also of a sort of medieval "populism" which derived from social and economic prejudice. The contrast which the Lollards drew between clerical luxury and popular poverty and between the endowment of churches and more practical and humane forms of Christian charity, reflected profound distrust of the conventional machinery of religious expression and also resent- ment of the clerical establishment, which seemed to prosper from its manipulation. Such sentiments were doubtlessly appealing to that class of disenchanted clergy and minor bourgeoisie, which provided the Lollard movement with its cadre; and these distinctions of class and 49Matthew, op. cit., 7. 50Ibid., 210. 51Pecock, Repressor, I, 195. 52See the remarks of William Thorpe in Pollard, op. cit., 140. 53See Wyclif's comments in Sermones, I, 91-92. 54Pollard, op. cit., 135. 55Pecock, Repressor, I, 208 ff.</page><page sequence="11">LOLLARDS AND IMAGES 37 status may have constituted an emotional and ideological bridge con- necting religious and social dissent in later medieval England. The Lollard attack on images provoked a quick response from the church. Replying to the heretics' criticism against images, several orthodox writers and preachers contributed to the creation of a small but important corpus of English iconodule literature.56 Most of it was the work of authors of the late fourteenth and first half of the fifteenth centuries; and Oxford scholars were prominent in their ranks. The apology for images, which was presented in a variety of literary forms -sermons, scholastic treatises, and claustral lectures devoted in whole or in part to the subject-bore the imprint of the classroom and lec- ture-hall. Its scholastic argumentation and traditional Latin eloquence contrasted sharply with the popular, sentimental, and spontaneous quality of the Lollard vernacular diatribes. It was heavily indebted to previous authorities, especially Aquinas, Bonaventure, and John of Damascus; and much of what was said was conventional and repeti- tious. It was acquainted with the events and conclusions of the Byzan- tine Iconoclast Controversy through works like Sicard of Cremona's Chronica Universalis, although there was a tendency to reach back to accepted early authorities such as Augustine, Gregory I, and especially to Scripture. Some of the literary defenses of image-worship like those by Roger Dymmock in the fourteenth century and Reginald Pecock in the fifteenth have been printed; but a considerable number of iconodule works have never been published and have been studied only in limited or occasional ways. Among the most prominent and easily identifiable of the contri- butors to the defense of image-worship were Roger Dymmock, Walter Hilton, Robert Rypon, Robert Alyngton, William Woodford, Thomas Netter, and Reginald Pecock, most of them Oxford-educated, first generation anti-Wyclifites, whose works spanned the period from 1395 to about the middle of the fifteenth century and confronted to some extent the Lollard critique of images. The presence of friars and canons -the Dominican Dymmock, the Carmelite Netter, the Franciscan Woodford, and the Augustinian Hilton-among the iconodules suggests the importance of this devotional custom within the English orders and also the scholastic expertise of later medieval monastic teaching. In the same year as the appearance of the Lollard "petition" of 1395, Roger Dymmock composed a detailed refutation of this list of heretical conclusions. In reply to the Lollard article, which he quoted and translated, and which condemned the veneration of "dead" images as idolatrous and contrary to Christian teaching on charity, Dymmock defended their instructional and devotional uses and their historical 56The manuscript evidence has been surveyed by James Crompton, "Lollard Doc- trine, with Special Reference to Image-Worship and Pilgrimages," Unpublished B.

JONES authenticity.57 The educational value of images, which could be under- stood by clergy and laity alike, far exceeds, he said, that of writing and speaking. Dymmock pointed out that the devotion paid to images passed naturally to the divine reality they symbolized and did not vio- late the Mosaic prohibition, which only condemned the worship of false gods. Dymmock based his argument for the historical validity of images on their use by the ancient Hebrews, who at God's command had decorated the Temple with cherubim, and their approval by Christ Himself, who had honored Caesar's visage on the Roman coin. Dym- mock insisted that the Lollards erred in supposing that man was a worthier symbol of divinity than inert images. Because of his intrinsic merit as a rational creature, man made a much less effective symbol than did images, which conveyed the worshiper's attention difectly to God and did not threaten to inflate human pride. To the Lollard com- plaint that the Church venerated the instrument of Christ's humilia- tion, Dymmock replied in defense of a universal symbol of salvation, which, as St. Thomas had taught, merited the same degree of reverence as was due Christ. In his arguments and anecdotes Dymmock was quite conventional-making points which became a standard defense of im- ages during the controversy. Considerably more ingenious was the treatise on images by Walter Hilton, which appeared between 1385 and 1395.58 Hilton, Augustinian canon of Thurgarton in Nottinghamshire and the author of the popular mystical treatise, The Scale of Perfection, composed a tract specifi- cally devoted to images, which Owst believed was influential in shap- ing the orthodox position concerning images.59 Hilton was no sterile scholastic disputant but, rather, the advocate of a mystical pietism and contemplative faith aimed at clergy and laity alike.60 His treatise on images was arranged in the form of Lollard "conclusions" to which he proposed counter-arguments drawn on the whole from Scriptural sources-always stamped, however, with his enthusiasm for the pietis- tic faith he advocated in the other works attributed to him.61 To Lol- lard objections that image-worship was condemned by the Mosaic 57Dymmock, op. cit., 180-91.

Hilton's treatise was biblical rather than scholastic in tone; and, in conformity with the current popularity of meditative exercises, emphasized their usefulness as devotional tools. Well before the end of the fourteenth century Wyclifism had been routed at Oxford. Several Oxford scholars, even some who had earlier been under Wyclif's influence, renounced his views and joined the anti-Wyclifite counter-defense. One of these was Dr. Robert Alyng- ton, who eventually rose to be chancellor of the university, and who composed a Determinatio de adoratione ymaginum within a work de- voted to the refutation of the Lollard "petition" of 1395.62 Another Ox- ford scholar, who has also been identified as one of the English icono- dules, was the Westphalian, John Sharpe, a noted Aristotelian, who was fellow of Queen's in 1403 or 1404, and who has been said to be the author of a tract, De adoratione et veneratione ymaginum, a copy of which may be preserved in a British Museum manuscript.63 Dr. Nicholas Radcliffe, an Oxford doctor of theology and archdeacon of St. Albans at the end of the fourteenth century, wrote a dialogue against Wyclif and included a defense of images within an unpublished scholastic treatise. In a quaestio devoted to the subject, Radcliffe, who participated in the prosecution of Wyclifites at the Blackfriars synod of 1382, mustered traditional iconodule authorities in defense of this devotional custom.64 62Emden, I, 30-31; Workman, op. cit., II, 139-40.

JONES The apologist for images, Thomas Netter of Walden, whose name has long been associated with the Fasciculi zizaniorum65-an odd col- lection of documents concerned mainly with the Lollard controversy- published a comprehensive refutation of Wyclifism in his Doctrinale antiquitatum fidei catholicae ecclesiae, wherein, aware of the furor Iconomachorum, he devoted considerable attention to the defense of images.66 Netter participated in the prosecution of Lollards and rose in the service of the English church and state to be provincial prior of the English Carmelites and confessor to King Henry VI.67 He was one of that generation of fourteenth-century English theologians who were gradually turning from "the excessive intellectualism and excessive subtlety of scholasticism" to biblically-oriented argumentation.68 In his Doctrinale, which attempted to refute the whole range of Lollard beliefs, he defended the veneration of images on the basis of Scriptural and historical precedents, explaining the difference between Christian image-worship and pagan idolatry, the circumstances surrounding the prohibition of images in the Old Testament, their acceptance by Chris- tians, and their continuing value as devotional aids. Among the more exceptional of the scholastic defenses of image- worship was a tract by William Woodford, a Franciscan doctor of theology and a colleague of Wyclif at Oxford, who was, possibly, the ablest and most outspoken critic of Wyclif and the Lollards at the end of the fourteenth century.69 Woodford published several polemical works against Lollardy before his death about 1411-a feat which won him fame as hereticorum extirpator acerrimus. He opposed Wyclifs theory of dominion and his views on the eucharist, and apparently at- tempted to refute Lollard iconoclasm. British Museum Harley MS. 31, which includes several of his works, contains also (fols. 182-94v) a treatise on images. (Another tract, preserved in British Museum Harley MS. 635, fols. 179-92v, has been identified as the work of Woodford, although it may have been written by John Sharpe.70) The Harleian 31 treatise is a tightly structured scholastic exercise, well informed of the opposing position, which sets forth the Lollard ob- jections to images and proposes counter-arguments drawn from the works of doctissimi Christiani such as Augustine, Gregory the Great, John of Damascus, Bonaventure, and Aquinas, who had demonstrated per naturam, per artem, per historiam, and per scripturam, the legit- imacy of images and their veneration by Christians.70a He begins with 65For Netter and the Fasciculi zizaniorum, see James Crompton, "Fasciculi zizaniorum, I, II," Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 12(1961), 35-45, 155-66. 66Doctrinale, III, 902-72, and for pilgrimages, ibid., 809-28. 67D.N.B., XIV, 231-34; Emden, II, 1343-44. 68Pantin, op. cit., 132-33. 69For Woodford's life and works, see D.N.B., XXI, 868; Emden, III, 2081-82; Workman, op. cit., I, 185-89. 70See n. 63. 70aBrit.

The author pointed out that if images were sinful then their artists and makers were guilty of promoting vice, which was illogical because they were approved by Scripture and Christian history and were no more likely to encourage misconduct than were other professions. He attacked Lollard biblical exegesis which in its strict literalism neglected to notice that the Mosaic pro- hibition was directed against the future worship of "alien gods"; and he explained how Christian revelation had qualified the binding effect of the old law.70b Looking to history, he noted that the ancient Ro- mans, the Hebrews, the early Christians, and the contemporary nobility had used signs and symbols for commemorative purposes; and, draw- ing on Bonaventure and Aquinas, he concluded the treatise with an analysis of the kinds of reverence to be paid images. The apology for image-worship continued well into the fifteenth century. A lengthy and rather novel defense of images was presented by Bishop Reginald Pecock in his Repressor of Over Much Blaming of the Clergy, which was completed and published between 1449 and 1455. Pecock, who was consecutively bishop of St. Asaph and bishop of Chichester, was a determined and outspoken, if somewhat eccentric opponent of Lollardy.71 Eventually his donnish rationalism, his pen- chant for theologizing in the vernacular, and his irrepressible egotism got him into trouble with the Church and led to his own indictment for heresy. The Lollard attack on images evidently troubled him much, for he returned to their defense on several occasions.72 In the long dis- cussion of images contained in the Repressor, Pecock defended their use on the basis of Scripture, good Christian custom, and the "doom of reason." Pecock's analysis of the specific objections of his oppo- nents provides a useful summary of the Lollard position on images, at least as it was understood by one of its most vociferous critics of the mid-fifteenth century.73 Pecock insisted that the Lollard prejudice in favor of a strictly biblical faith ignored the role of reason as a basis of religious belief and behavior. Specifically, he denied that the absence of explicit biblical injunctions to venerate images militated against their use by Chris- tians. He vehemently rejected the Lollard argument that occasional abuses invalidated such venerable institutions of the church as images, relics, and pilgrimages.

JONES controversy were his examination of the historical origin of pagan idolatry in order to show that the Mosaic prohibition was directed only against the worship of demons which had inhabited graven images, and his analysis of the psychology of human perception and communication in order to demonstrate the efficacy of images as instructional devices and devotional aids.73a There were other contributors to the small library of English icono- dulia. Robert Rypon, sub-prior of Durham and prior of Finchale at the end of the fourteenth century, who himself once criticized the cruder aspects of image-worship, preached a sermon denouncing the Lollards as heretics and "idolaters," like the pagans, Jews, Saracens, and sorcerers, who also worshiped the wrong things.74 Another monastic contributor was a certain Master Geoffrey the Monk, other- wise unknown, whose sermon on images is preserved in British Mu- seum Royal MS. 8.F.XII., fols. 12v-16. In addition, British Museum Arundel MS. 458, which contains a number of documents concerning the Hussite movement in Bohemia, includes an anonymous scholastic treatise on images directed against those "impious men," who, like the Waldensians, opposed their worship.75 This may be a continental im- portation, suggesting an exchange of arguments between England and Bohemia.76 The most productive period of debate was the late four- teenth and early fifteenth centuries, although the issue remained alive down to the English Reformation. Lollards continued to denounce image-worship and were drawn to reformers like John Colet, dean of St. Paul's and Christian humanist, who was also critical of their ex- cessive veneration.77 73albid., 208ff., 267ff. Pecock pointed out that the existence of the sacraments proved that there were legitimate alternatives to Scripture as means of religious instruc- tion; that visual symbols were sometimes more effective than audial or literary ones; that the duties of the clergy entailed more than simply the instruction of the laity, thereby im- posing on the individual Christian ultimate responsibility for his own salvation. Later in the work Pecock used the concept of the "absent friend" to explore the evocative power of the cross on the human imagination and emotions. 74See his sermon notebook in Brit. Mus.

The English iconodules defined idolatria in a narrow, historical sense, applicable to pagans and infidels, who worshiped the wrong things, and sometimes to sorcerers, who used images for magical purposes.83 Bishop Pecock argued at length that the Lollard criticism of the church for promoting idolatry was based upon a misunderstanding of what constituted pagan idolatry and how it had come about historically.84 Further, the iconodules denied that Christians believed that images possessed an intrinsic supernatural power (numen) or that they worshiped the material substances from which they were fashioned.85 The former misconception was, they said, the delusion of pagans; and the latter was so patently false that, were it accepted, men would be compelled to worship the most atro- cious objects simply because they were made from sacred substances. 78See the definition of idolatria in excerpts from John of Whethamstede's Granarium de viris illustribus, Brit. Mus. Arundel MS. 11, fols. 137-38v, wherein the pagan nature of idolatry is explained with reference to classical and patristic sources. 79This point is insisteo upon by Netter, Doctrinale, III, 913-15. 80Summa Theologica, IIIa, q. xxv, a. 3; De memoria et reminiscentia, 450b, 20-30. 81De Fide Orthodoxa, IV, 16. 82Robert Rypon, Thomas Netter, and other iconodules replied to the accusation of idolatry by turning the argument around and accusing the Lollards of worshiping false gods and, therefore, of being "idolaters."

JONES English iconodules countered a literal interpretation of the Deca- logue by explaining that the proximity of paganism to the ancient Hebrews had prompted God to warn them against the errors of neigh- boring gentiles-a danger that no longer existed.86 Even Wyclif had admitted that the Mosaic prohibition preceded the Incarnation and dated from a time when paganism was still rampant.87 Thomas Netter, a defender of images, explained that the Hebrews had lived in igno- rance of the divine reality represented by Christ but that Christians en- joyed the advantage of having known and seen the incarnate God: "The Jews did not, therefore, fashion distinct images of things, because, in the prevailing darkness, everything was shadowy, and they saw nothing distinctly. But we Christians, having knowledge of Christ, cast out the old shadows and, because we have been transformed in His image, praise images."88 William Woodford wondered whether Christians should be compelled to conform to the old law more than the ancient Jews, who occasionally made images at God's command; and he doubted the effect of any part of Hebraic law that was not in accord with the law of nature underlying Christian ethics.89 The iconodules justified and explained the liturgical and devotional traditions of the medieval church and the reverence paid images through prayer and sacrifice by quoting Thomas Aquinas' exalted no- tion of the cross and the varieties of adoration-latria, dulia, and hyperdulia-owed the crucifix and images of the saints. While care- fully distingushing between divinity and physical representations of it and while explaining the different types of reverence owed different degrees of sanctity, Aquinas enhanced the defense of images by in- sisting that the same kind of adoration (latria) due Christ was also due the cross.90 Aquinas was, of course, talking about the highest symbol of divinity; and he conceded that the human Jesus and the saints were due lesser degrees of veneration (hyperdulia and dulia respectively).91 Nevertheless, the Thomistic justification of images strongly rein- forced the iconodule position and was often cited by the orthodox dur- ing the Lollard controversy. They were also fond of quoting Aquinas' analysis of the "exterior" and "interior" aspects of the act of adora- tion.92 The iconodules denied that Christians venerated their images in the same way that pagans worshiped their idols; but even when they admitted the existence of superstitious practices, they refused to admit that such abuses imperiled the usefulness of images as devotional aids. 86See, for instance, Netter, Doctrinale, III, 937-39; William Woodford, Brit.

The Augustinian comparison of images with the insignia of royalty, which also referred to a higher reality and thereby demanded respect, was frequently cited, sometimes with contemporary allusions to the king's seal and heraldic devices.95 Walter Hilton explained the evocative power of the cross by means of the simile of the absent friend; and he also compared images with sacraments as compelling symbolizations of divinity.96 Bishop Pecock advocated a commonsense, if somewhat vulgar, notion of images, which he characterized as "rememoratijf or mynding signs" and compared with a string on the finger as a sort of aide memoire.97 The most sophisticated analysis of symbolism attempted by English iconodules was that composed by William Woodford, who explained the variety and frequency of images in human experience and physi- cal nature. The universality and, by implication, the validity of images were, Woodford argued, clearly demonstrated by the duplication of forms visually, genetically, literarily, and conceptually, and by the oc- currence of images in reflections, writing, inherited traits, and dreams.98 The orthodox rejected the Lollard expression of preference for man as a more suitable object of veneration than a statue or painting. Dym- mock, Netter, and others pointed out that such an argument was based on a misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of symbolic repre- sentation.99 The intrinsic importance of a rational being, such as man, made him a much less satisfactory symbol of divinity than an insen- 93Owst, Literature and Pulpit, 137-39, commenting on Brit.

JONES sible image, which referred the attention of the worshiper directly to God and avoided the danger of inflating human pride and vainglory. Although the educational potential of medieval religious art and the broader question of the interrelationship of visual and verbal forms of medieval religious expression remain obscure, the apologists for images repeatedly argued for the recognition of the usefulness of stat- ues and paintings as instructional tools. Gregory the Great was a ven- erable ally of both camps, since in his famous letters to Serenus of Marseilles he both cautioned against the idolatrous worship of images and warned against their destruction.'00 Moreover, it was Gregory who gave the Middle Ages its well-known description of images as the bible of the unlearned. Bonaventure expanded on the Gregorian char- acterization of images as "lewd men's books" by explaining euphoni- ously their value for education (propter simplicium ruditatem), for inspiration (propter affectuum tarditatem), and for commemo- ration (propter memoriae labilitatem).101 William Woodford added to Bonaventure's list several other practical uses of images, which, he said, served also to reveal the future judgment and the Sec- ond Coming, to educate Christ's disciples, to honor the founders and endowers of churches, and to provide physical and spiritual therapy to worshipers.102 It was this usefulness of images for edification and in- spiration that was most often stressed by their admirers, who, like Hil- ton, insisted not only that they were not an impediment to "spiritual" and "interior" religion, but, rather, a great help; and from Roger Dym- mock to Reginald Pecock they argued on behalf of the superiority of the visual to the audial and literary methods of Christian education. English iconodules searched for and found scriptural warrant for their convictions; and they were strict literalists when it suited their purposes. They collected biblical references to the various physical shapes assumed by persons of the Trinity to prove the validity of the traditional medieval representation of them in anthropomorphic and animal form. Bede's exposition of the decoration of Solomon's temple, which even Wyclif had cited as justifying the proper use of images, was frequently quoted by their defenders. At times the orthodox ques- tioned the soundness of Lollard biblical interpretation. Thomas Netter, for instance, argued that the actual sense of the commandment was, as Bede had said, merely to prohibit the making of images which replaced God as the object of worship: "non facies tibi scuptile, idest, ut sit tibi 100Patrologiae Cursus Completus...

Specifically, Thomas Netter denied the Lol- lard claim that they had first been introduced by Pope Marcellinus;109 although Walter Hilton conceded that images, which had not been needed by "perfect" Christians of the Apostolic church, had been popularized as devotional aids for the large number of new converts entering the church after the cessation of Roman persecution.110 Whereas the Lollards rejected the alleged marvelous virtues of im- ages as the product of priestly deception or, perhaps, of diabolical trickery, the apologists for them upheld the authenticity of their mir- 103Netter, Doctrinale, III, 918.

JONES acles and cited these as proof of divine sanction.11 The feasibility of such miracles seemed to justify the traditional doctrine of good works represented by votive-offerings and pilgrimages and also the integ- rity of the sacred reputations of certain popular cults. Thomas Netter replied to Lollard objections concerning the popular custom of calling some images by specific holy names, thereby implying that the image and the divine were identical, by denying that such rhetorical common- places had adverse effects or signified belief in pagan idolatry.112 Regi- nald Pecock rejected what he construed to be mere quibbling over the relative merit of different kinds of Christian charity and defended the legitimacy of all conventional forms of pious expression and ac- tion;113 and Roger Dymmock, writing half-a-century previously, ar- gued that the gifts of the devout to images did eventually reach the poor and needy.114 In summarizing, it would seem that Wyclif's critique of images was in conformity with a critical but non-heretical tradition of later medieval reformism, which continued to speak out against the ex- cesses of image-worship even after the outbreak of Lollardy. Later Lollardy was less broad-minded about images than Wyclif had been, although it did not preach abolitionism and was willing to tolerate unadorned crucifixes and simple images of saints as commemorative signs. Its novelty and radicalism derived mainly from its provocative rhetoric, its distrust of aristocratic ecclesiasticism, and its preference for socially beneficial acts of charity over other expressions of Chris- tian piety. Lollard criticism of images was grounded on a literal ap- plication of the second commandment to contemporary devotional cus- toms in the belief that medieval Christians actually worshiped statues and paintings and were, accordingly, guilty of the pagan sin of idolatria. The Lollards were fond of contrasting-always to their credit-the more affective and "spiritual" quality of their faith with the alleged physicality and superficiality of orthodox religion. In opposition to the traditional doctrine of good works advocated by the church, they preached a practical humanitarianism, motivated by a spirit of chari- tableness and a highly unfavorable view of the ecclesiastical establish- ment. One of the basic denominators of Lollardy was its preference for an abstract, universalized idea of divinity as contrasted with the an- thropomorphic cults cherished by the church and most of the laity; and one of their most frequent recriminations was accusing the clergy of substituting lesser, human standards of piety for the original values of Christianity. Applying this idea to the veneration of im- 111bid., fol. 180; Netter, Doctrinale, III, 967-72. 12Netter, Doctrinale, III, 950.

Lollard moralizing about art-the persistent confusion of ethics with aesthetics-was an unusual twist of the Gregorian view of images resulting from the coincidence of class prejudice with Wy- clifite nostalgia for primitive Christianity. The literary defense of images, to which the community of Oxford scholars made an important contribution, was basically traditionalist and academic, drawing heavily on earlier iconodule arguments by Gregory I, Bede, John of Damascus, Aquinas, and Bonaventure. Yet, in response to the challenge of its opponents, it contributed to the bibli- cism of later medieval theology by seeking proof of its views in Scrip- ture. The English iconodules flatly denied, as a misinterpretation of revelation and history, the Lollard claim that the veneration of Chris- tian images and pagan idolatry were identical; and they justified their beliefs by an examination of the semantics and historical circum- stances of the Decalogue. The historical perspective of the Lollards, which vented itself in an awareness of the discrepancies between Apos- tolic Christianity and the contemporary church, was matched on the other side by a similar consciousness of historical conditioning, which underlay Catholic refusal to equate ancient polytheism with the devo- tional customs of the medieval church. The iconodules rejected the Lollard insistence upon legitimatizing all religious institutions accord- ing to standards derived from a highly idealized interpretation of primitive Christianity; instead they defended the validity of universal ecclesiastical tradition as demonstrated by Christian hagiography and post-Apostolic church history. In terms borrowed from familiar patris- tic and scholastic sources, they reaffirmed the traditional theory of re- ligious symbolism, the educational utilitarianism of images, and the canonical doctrine of good works as grounded upon divine mandate and human psychology. They differed from the Lollards less in the ex- pectation that piety should culminate in good works than in their ex- pectation of the form such acts should take. The iconodules defended the spiritual value and validity of the en- tire range of pious acts, including gifts to the poor, against Lollard preference for a socially beneficial humanitarianism. The Lollard stereotypes, which contrasted the ritualism of the church with their own more evangelical faith, were patently unfair and unhistorical, since image-worship was integrally connected with the devotional re- vival of the later medieval English church-as authors like Hilton and Netter made clear. What Netter characterized as "media delectandi in Deo" were by no means vapid formalities of a sterile religion, but, rather, an immensely popular aid to later medieval Christian devo-</page><page sequence="24">50 W. R. JONES tionalism.115 The Lollard attack on images had only sporadically de- structive effects on the course of English iconographical development. The debate never attracted the attention of the medieval artist nor led to a reappraisal of the basic theory and practice of representing divin- ity in pigment and stone. The single episode discovered by Mr. Thom- son, involving the sixteenth-century painter of the diocese of Worces- ter, who refused to portray St. Paul as an apostle because he denied that the saint had been one of the twelve, was exceptional.16 Accord- ingly, the defense of images remained the responsibility of biblical critics, scholastic theologians, and church historians, who succeeded in reviewing and synthesizing the best opinion on the subject available to English scholars of the later Middle Ages.
