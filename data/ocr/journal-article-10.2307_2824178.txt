<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMAL GAMES. By Russell Freedman; illustrated by St. Tamara. Holiday House, New York. $4.95.32 p.; ill.; no index. 1976. This nicely illustrated book describes some of the "play" activities of young animals (exclusively birds and large mammals). Both the descriptions and how and why the activities occur are accurate, but there is a tendency to overuse anthropomorphic terms (goril- las play "king-of-the-mountain", the lion cub "pre- tends" to hunt). Since this is a book designed primar- ily for pre-school children, these action images are useful for initial understanding of animal behavior, but I hope the adult reader will help the child under- stand the natural role an activity has in the develop- ment and survival of the animal. The black-and-white line drawings are beautiful in their accuracy, but color might have helped the young reader differentiate the main points of the illustra- tions.
