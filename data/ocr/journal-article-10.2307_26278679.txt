<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAMUS AND THE MEANING OF REVOLT Ben Stoltzfus With regard to man's daily struggle for existence, says Camus, revolt plays the same role that Descartes "cogito" does in relation to thought and the process of systematic doubt. Man's cry of revolt is a premise, the first indication that there is perhaps some inherent value in man worth revolting for, since, otherwise, rebellion would be mean ingless, would lose its raison d'être: "I cry out that I believe in nothing and that everything is absurd, but I cannot doubt my cry and I must, at least, believe in my protestation. The first and only evidence thus given me at the heart of the absurd experience is my revolt."i The metaphysical rebel protests his annihilation by death and his irremediable banishment to alien and sometimes hostile surround ings; but at the very center of his revolt is an island of innocence which, at least, gives him the intuition of a lost paradise and, some times, the vision of a promised land hovering somewhere in the dis tance beyond his cry. The cry may be one of immediate physical suffering, like the child's (who is dying of the plague), whose monotone, discordant, and inhuman quality seems to emanate from all men and from all time; or it may, as in the case of Caligula, have transformed itself into the overt hostile acts of metaphysical revolt intent on demon strating the logical consequences of a free man in an absurd world. At the heart of Caligula's cry, however, is the death of his sister Drusilla. It is her death which precipitates his "logical madness" and which, even though he denies it, is the source of his revolt. Meursault's flirtation with the sun has transformed itself, in Cali gula's case, into a flirtation with the moon, each a symbol and a cruel reminder of man's mortality: "men die and they are not happy," says Caligula. The revolt of Camus' heroes is fundamentally metaphysical—the affirmation of man's self against his condition and the entire crea tion. In doing so man declares himself frustrated. The sun "slaps" 1 L'Homme révolté (Paris, Gallimard, 1951), p. 21. 293</page><page sequence="2">Meursault, and Caligula grasps vainly for the moon. Because they are frustrated by creation, they rebel. Revolt then is the conscious or unconscious affirmation by man of his own humanity in the face of a destiny (death) which will ultimately crush him. It is this face to face awareness of an eventual finality (since neither Camus nor his fictional characters believe in an afterlife) which leads the person ages of his novels, plays, and short stories to cry out in protest against their human condition. "Men cry," says Caligula, "because things are not as they should be." This disenchantment is an alienation from the world. Man's honeymoon on earth with the sun and the air and the sea, as Camus describes it in Nuptials (Noces), is violated by his future death. Meur sault accidentally shoots the Arab because, fundamentally, he feels threatened by the sun. The sun that fateful afternoon on the beach is the same sun which shone so brightly on his mother's coffin. The coffin and the sun, as a consciousness of death, become a "blinding light," a too frequent reminder that the "honeymoon" is not eternal. Martha, on the other hand, in the Misunderstanding, is one step removed from the metaphysical revolt. She is an exile on an arid plateau of central Europe far from the sunny beaches of "paradise" for which she longs.2 Her revolt also stems from the fact that "things are not as they should be." When she says that her hate is the most human element in her, this hate postulates a premise for happiness and the right to revolt when desire has not been fulfilled. Camus may lament that her freedom and her revolt are of the wrong kind because, as he so strongly and so ironically implies (Martha un knowingly kills her brother), man is his brother's keeper. Martha revolts because of an unrealized potential. Her brother, Jan, however, need not have returned to his home land to be murdered, for he had achieved some degree of happiness (insomuch as he has lived by the sea where "the sunsets are over whelming" and he was happily married), yet he, like Bernard Rieux in The Plague, feels exiled as long as other men suffer and as long as others are not happy. Dr. Rieux's sense of responsibility does not allow him to bask complacently in his own happiness as long as some men continue to exist in a state of distress. Rieux is, after all, a modern Sisyphus, condemned not to roll a stone towards the sum mits but, as a doctor, to minister to the sick and the suffering (the plague will be his rock and will give him dignity). Oran is a city 'Camus (in Noces, p. 18) writes: "I have to be naked and then dive into the sea, my body still perfumed with the essences of the earth, to wash them in the water and to join together on my skin the embrace for which and for so long, mouth to mouth, the earth and the sea have been sighing for each other." 294 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">of exile and the plague represents evil in any or all of its manifesta tions. On the metaphysical level the cry of revolt is directed towards exile, while on the social level man rebels against sociological, politi cal, or human inequity. I should perhaps mention now that the prototypes for Camus' rebels are Malraux's revolutionaries whose violence also stems from a sense of alienation—from man's triple divorce from the world, from society, and from himself. If Camus' characters are not so obsessed with death as Malraux's are, they do, at least, have in common their rebellion against a meaningless world which will negate their exist ence in the final moment of death. It is this consciousness of their own obliteration which Malraux's heroes channel into revolutionary activity and which most of Camus' characters manifest as a meta physical revolt. It is not surprising, therefore, that Camus, during his Nobel prize speech, should have paid public tribute to the man who had already set forth all of Camus' major themes. The difference between Camus' rebel and Malraux's revolution aries is all-important, however. Like Malraux himself, his revolu tionaries postulate action as the only answer to the forces which negate, not only man, but the dignity within man. Such idealism was per haps appropriate to the 1930's, but it seems dated today; nor can we accept such commitment as the solely valid literary endeavor. Curious ly, enough, the book (The Royal Way) which Malraux left out of the Pléiade edition of his novels best explains the motives of his and Camus' subsequent fictional heroes. The purpose of a novel, according to Malraux, is not to create different fictional types (like Julien Sorel or le Père Goriot), but to elaborate an intellectual position. Malraux's characters, therefore, all resemble each other, and it is, basically, his philosophy which they elucidate. Vannec's and Perken's obsession with death, in The Royal Way, and Berger's statement, in The Walnut Trees of Alten burg, that man does not know why he was born, why he is alive, or why he will die are, essentially, the elaboration of Malraux's intellectual premises. Moreover, if, as Sartre says, God does not exist and if there is no life after death towards which a specific morality can aspire, then man must create his own purpose and his own morality. Existence then precedes essence and there is no a priori morality. This means that man is free from the traditional dictates of a religious or a socialized morality and that he must choose a life in keeping with the authenticity of his inner being. The logical conclusion to man's absolute freedom, as Sartre has pointed out, is that whether someone becomes a Napoleon or dies a drunkard the THE MEANING OF REVOLT 295</page><page sequence="4">end result is the same—that is, there is neither necessity nor purpose to life or to existence. Roquentin, in Nausea, remarks that men, like objects, exist at random and for no apparent reason. Critics have attacked Sartre on the grounds that this position deprives man, not only of purpose, but of hope. Camus and Sartre both say, however, that existence is its own reason for being while hope, according to Camus, as the last evil to escape from Pandora's box, is the most insidious of all, since it is man's belief in an afterlife, which deprives him of the immediacy and intensity of living. Camus' notion of the absurd, though very close to Sartre's, differs primarily in that Camus suggests there is perhaps some inherent human value (as the Greeks thought) worth revolting for. Thus The Misunderstanding and Caligula are a demonstration that Martha's freedom and Caligula's freedom can lead to wrong choices—choices which not only negate others but which negate the self. This is also true of Dora in The Just Assassins. The love of which these per sons have been deprived makes them incapable of loving in return. Their revolt, unlike Rieux's "constructive" commitment, becomes de structive. Their hate will also destroy them. Caligula will be assassin ated by those whom he tried to "enlighten," Martha will be deprived of her mother's love, and Dora finds that she can no longer "love" the man she was in love with. (The violence of these characters' de structive tendencies reminds us of the explorations of the Marquis de Sade). Caligula tells Scipion that he (Scipion) is pure in good even as he (Caligula) is pure in his evil. What matters precisely, in this connection, is the emphasis on the destructive versus the creative possibilities in man. Caligula's flirtation with the moon was a pre disposing factor—a latent metaphysical revolt. The precipitating factor was the death of Drusilla. Alienated from the world and de prived of human love by the very world from which he feels alienated, Caligula assumes the pedagogical garb of a mad, absolute, and "free" tyrant. In spite of the polemic which exists over whether Camus is or is not an existentialist or whether Malraux could conceivably also be labelled one, the literary premises of these three writers are essen tially the same. Birth and death circumscribe the limits of man's existence. Within these limits man gives his life meaning through action, through choice, or through revolt—all manifestations of a similar process. The degrees of man's freedom and obsession with death, as handled by these three authors, are purely a matter of emphasis. They all, sooner or later, create heroes who are "engagés." Perken, Vannée, Roquentin, and Meursault represent the author's 296 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">search for a certain dimension of consciousness. Once these char acters and the reader have been brought to the threshold of lucidity— that is, to view existence, including death, objectively—they are immediately committed to the social struggle: Tchen, Katow, and Kyo for Malraux, Brunet and Hoederer for Sartre, Dr. Rieux for Camus. The quality of the commitment, however, will depend on the degree of alienation from the world, from society, and from the self. Thus Tchen, in Man's Fate, becomes enveloped in his own terrorism and dies (commits suicide) in a futile attempt to assassinate Chiang Kai shek. He has lost the sense of brotherhood and dedication to a cause which animates Kyo and Katow. Camus, however, and in spite of the brotherhood and dedication to the cause, also rejects the violence of the revolutionary hero. This is affirmed not only by the inability of "the just assassins" to establish significant emotional bonds among themselves but also by Camus' many pronouncements in The Rebel on the virtues of the non-violent revolt. Love, curiously enough, is a dimension totally lacking in Camus' fictional characters. His heroes revolt because they are not loved, but their negative, self-centered violence, does not find a corollary in Dr. Rieux as an "homme engagé," since Rieux sees his role as that of a modern Sisyphus. The total fulfilling role of a man-woman rela tionship, the kind of relationship D. H. Lawrence speaks of, is absent. The only fulfilling love relationship Camus writes about, particularly in Nuptials (Noces,) is of man's metaphysical honeymoon with the world of which the physical union of man and woman is a part. Yet Camus implies that if his heroes were loved, or, if they could love, their sense of metaphysical exile would be less acute, that they would perhaps suffer less. If Camus' fictional world, like Malraux's, is an exploration of the author's intellectual and philosophical position, then the chapters in Nuptials, which are a hymn to the earth and its beauties, represent the island of innocence to which I referred at the beginning of my analysis. This book of essays is most clearly a manifestation of Camus' joy and exultation in living, while Caligula, like Gide's The Im moralist or Strait is the Gate, corresponds to the snuffing out of all but one of the buds on the rosebush in order to study its logical and monstrous flowering. Meursault's murder is comparable to Gide's exploration of possibilities (in artistic terms of course and not on intellectual ones as in The Myth of Sisyphus or in The Rebel) and shows the consequences of "tragic complicity." Yet this island of innocence has been singled out as both the source and the cause of THE MEANING OF REVOLT 297</page><page sequence="6">existential tragedy; for "tragic complicity" is man's tendency to anthropomorphize inanimate objects, his environment, and Nature. To humanize things is to postulate a non-existent oneness be tween them and man. Such complicity, it is alleged, derives from the fact that man persists in attributing a oneness to a relationship which can only exist in terms of duality. Roquentin's "nausea" over comes him every time an object or a thing, particularly the tree root, begins to "exist." Sartre communicates artistically this emerg ing "bond" between Roquentin and the things of his environment in terms of a poetic metaphor, in terms of "the black skin of the root." The root is given a human quality and, by virtue of its existence, Roquentin gradually and "nauseatingly" brings the idea of his own existence into consciousness. Camus' use of metaphor also communi cates this anthropomorphism, and it is this contamination of the non human by the human which clarifies both the cause and the source of Meursault's murder of the Arab. Meursault feels the "cymbals of the sun," "the thick ardent breath of the sea"; the sunlight is a "dazzling rain," its reflection is "a sword of light," and it "grinds into" his eyes. While a number of critics have pointed out that the reflec tion of the sun on the Arab's knife is an extension of the dagger which "stabs" his eyes and that the spring which will quench Meur sault's thirst is behind the rock and the Arab, Robbe-Grillet is per haps the first to stress the broader predisposing factor of Meursault's "tragic complicity."3 Meursault, like the Camus of Nuptials, likes to swim, to sunbathe, to make love, and to commune with the sun, the air, and the vast horizon. Meursault, like Camus, is genuinely happy when in contact with the earth (the beach), fire (the sun), water (the sea), and the air (the sky). There is another side, however, to the warm radiance of the earth and that is the cold wind blowing over the rocky wastes at Djémila. This cold wind, which is described in Nuptials, like the sun slapping Meursault, and the moon hovering beyond Caligula's grasp, is Camus' symbolic reminder that life is finite, that man's honey moon on earth is limited, that happiness is transitory. Meursault, who is capable of a remarkable animal and physical union with the benevolent forces of nature is, nevertheless, angry with the world which will ultimately deny him. Caligula's sensuous description of the moon and its unattainability is the basis for his "lover's quarrel." Meursault was the first to rebel at the fact that the world is an inconstant bedmate. » For a more complete discussion of "tragic complicity" see my article "La Connivence tragique de l'Etranger et du Voyeur," La Revue des Lettres Modernes, Spring, 1964, special issue on the "nouveau roman." 298 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">The theme of exile and the vision of a realm beyond, so promi nent in the title The Exile and the Kingdom, suggests that each man has a "kingdom" towards which he aspires or from which he has been alienated. Janine, in The Adulteress, was a happy, vigorous, athletic young woman. Twenty years later, and married, she wonders if the fear of growing old, alone, was enough to justify the sacrifice of her youthful freedom to a man whom she esteems but does not love. Her ecstatic and "adulterous" union with the night and the sky and the earth is a fleeting moment of earthly felicity capable of warming the chill of the desert (the last essay on death in Nuptials is entitled "The Desert" and the "wind at Djémila" is the same cold wind blowing across the desert of Janine's life). But when she re turns to bed and the "hard shoulder" of her husband (he gets up for a drink of water and turns on the light), the light "slaps her in the face" and the metaphoric illumination which takes place, like the sun's role in The Stranger, sheds light on the reasons for Janine's tears. Her cry of protest is contained in subdued and muffled sobs, a faintly audible submission to mortality and her own unhappiness. Nature as described in The Plague provides a hostile environment for man. Yet, as portrayed in Nuptials and The Summer it is benevo lent as well as hostile and it is man's exile from its benevolence which seems to be at the heart of Camus' revolt. It is not insignifi cant that Oran, the city of the "plague" is closed upon itself, with its back to the sea, while Algiers in The Stranger is a luminous city open to the sea. Moreover, the kind of rebellion Camus" charac ters adopt will depend on the extent to which they recognize this duality in Nature. Meursault is primarily a passive rebel, apparently indifferent to his surroundings. Caligula who sees the gods as venge ful will, in his mad rebellion, attempt to duplicate Nature's destruc tive possibilities and the random selection and chaos engendered by death. Martha's revolt occurs because she lives on an arid plateau far from the luxuriant landscape described in Nuptials: "The inces sant unfurling of the waves on the sand reached me through space shimmering with golden pollen. Sea, countryside, silence, perfumes of this earth, I filled myself with a living fragrance and I bit into the already golden fruit of the world, overwhelmed to feel and scent its sweet and strong juice flowing along my lips."4 Martha kills Jan because his description of the "overwhelming sun sets" by the sea reminds her of her unfulfilled humanity. "Whenever I am far from this land I imagine its twilights as a promise of happi 1 Noces (Paris, Gallimard, 1950), p. 25. •Noces, p. 51. THE MEANING OF REVOLT 299</page><page sequence="8">ness."5 It is his money which will enable her to leave her place of exile for that felicitous region which she envisions. The story entitled A Stone Which Grows describes a different kind of exile based, perhaps, on a religious (in the secular sense) distor tion of values—a distortion which suggests that the miraculous stone belongs, not in the church, but at the hearth, among men. And so, Sisyphus' stone is to be carried, or rolled, for the sake of man; the effort is, and must remain, an earthbound one and Camus implies, thereby, that Christianity, as it is practiced, imposes an alienation on man's fundamental harmony and union with the world for the sake of an abstract spirituality which negates his true human potential. The symbolic nature of Camus' landscapes and the actions of his personages will, therefore, correspond to the degree and quality of each character's distance from happiness, perhaps even integration, if I may be permitted a psychological term. Malraux's revolutionaries will kill in order to obtain what they want. Dora, the just assassin, Martha and Caligula will kill deliberately and in full consciousness of their acts. Meursault will kill involuntarily, and Dr. Rieux will be the healer. Camus himself is a committed artist, but he has not gone as far as Malraux and Sartre in sacrificing his art for the sake of social message. Camus' art possesses that essential blend of form and content in which form is symbol and in which symbol is content. Symbolically then, men (Martha) will continue to kill other men (her brother Jan) as long as a capacity for happiness remains un realized. Caligula wants "the moon, or happiness, or immortality." Meursault's quarrel with the world is the same as Caligula's, and his indifference (L'Indifférent was once Camus' proposed title for the novel) to society is logical if the world is absurd. In an absurd world there is no meaning except the meaning man gives his action (Mal raux), his choice (Sartre), or his revolt (Camus). This is the common tie. Camus' social rebel is a non-violent one who says "no" to a "master" who has overstepped an ideological limit. But this "no" is a "yes"—a positive affirmation of his own human dignity which will tolerate no further encroachments on his rights to a limited happiness. The greater the degree of unhappiness the more violent the revolt. Rieux, like Sisyphus, finds dignity and meaning in his profession as a doctor and in his struggle against the Plague. So does Camus as a novelist and journalist. Martha, who has never seen the beach and the sun and the ocean, will kill so that the money she steals will take her to the promised land. Meursault, on the contrary, dwells in the "promised land" which Martha envisions: "Under the morning sun, 300 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">an enormous happiness balances itself in space."6 His quarrel then is not with an inadequate life but with death—a death which is a con stant reminder and negation of daily pleasures. It is this awareness of death, his mother's death (which opens the novel), from which he will try to hide behind a facade of indifference. A society of men which exists in a world devoid of purpose and meaning is indeed full of sound and fury signifying nothing. Meur sault is, therefore, as Camus says in his preface to the American Schoolbook edition of L'Etranger, "the only Christ we deserve." Society, riddled with duplicity, fraud, and the masking of reality, will not tolerate an act ("Do you want my life to have no meaning?" says the judge to Meursault) capable of bringing man face to face with an "absurd" world and the fraud of a convention which con demns a man to death because "he has buried a mother with the heart of a criminal." Caligula's logical madness, his usurping of the power of death and destiny which is apparently indiscriminate in that the young frequently die before the old—is for the benefit of those members of society who do not know what it means to long for a moon eternally beyond man's grasp. But the moon is a relative commodity. Meursault realizes im mediately, but too late, that he has struck four sharp raps "on the door of misfortune," that he has destroyed "the exceptional silence of a beach where he had been happy." The things he misses most in prison are the beach, the water, the sun, the air, and lovemaking— relatively simple pleasures but nevertheless pleasures which testify to his fundamental oneness with nature. He, like the adulteress, opens "to the tender indifference of the world," so much like him, so "fra ternal," or, in her case, so "sisterly." It is not idle to imagine that the Meursault who is executed and who is so intelligently analytical in Part II of The Stranger would have been capable of writing Nuptials, for Nuptials is a hymn to the earth, to her joys and to her pleasures. It is not a hedonistic hymn but, rather, a song in praise of man's fundamental capacity to be happy when in contact with certain elemental forces of his environment from which he draws his strength and from which spring forth his capacities for creative existence. This kind of bond with Nature, however, negates the insidious quali ties of "tragic complicity." Humanising Nature can, in the case of Roquentin and Meursault, represent its contamination. But Janine's "adultery," Rieux's rejuvenating swim in the sea at the height of the plague, and Camus' own lyric exuberance in Nuptials indicates that • Noces, p. 18. THE MEANING OF REVOLT 301</page><page sequence="10">a bond with nature need not be tragic, that it may, on the contrary, be the source of a rebirth. In conclusion, then, we can say that the cry of revolt comes from the very heart of man's unrealized potential—from his unfulfilled desires.7 The cry is the sound of his alienation from happiness. Camus' characters who sense the absurd, or rebel, or feel exiled from the kingdom, do so either in response to a profound need or in answer to a deeply felt frustration. This frustration comes from man's feeling of estrangement from the world, from society, and from himself. The manifestations of this alienation are as varied as the different discernible facets Camus' fictional heroes reveal. If critics have dwelt more on its visible aspects, this is because Camus' personages react to their dilemma either as exiles or as rebels. It is this reaction which often obscures, even masks, the island of innocence, the center from which it emanates. The revolt, unfortunately, may even negate the value it is affirming, and that is why the quality of the cry itself is all-important. ' I have purposely omitted a discussion of The Fall from my analysis because, it seems to me, Jean-Baptiste Clamence is in hell. He typifies a self-satisfied complacent bourgeoisie surrounded by the canals of Amsterdam which are the circles of hell. Clamence is content to sit in a bar by the waterfront where he accosts would-be listeners and sympathizers. If he is the analogue of a sick and degraded humanity which pays lip service to human values but does nothing concrete to right the balance of social inequity, then he is one of us. His behavior is not a revolt but merely the recognition of guilt. He is a mirror-image of ourselves, content to sit quietly in verbal expiation of his (our) sins. He is not even a rebel, as are Camus' other protagonists. Nor does he really feel alienated. He likes his occupation in the gray, dismal, Northern city far from the luminescence of the Mediterranean beaches. If Camus' metaphor for happiness is contact with the sun and the sea, then Clamence, who is stagnating in hell, and who apparently does not know it, has sunk too low even to rebel. 302</page></plain_text>
