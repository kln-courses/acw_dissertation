A Study of Vehicle Vibration Spectra as Related to Seating Dynamics. L. F. Stikeleather, G. O. Hall and A. O. Radke, Universal Oil Products Co. Some new vehicle ride vibration data are presented. The Jane way recommended limit, Pradko/Lee absorbed pow- er, and MIL-Std-1472A (proposed ISO tolerance criteria) provide formats for the data presentation. A brief literature review of the subjective tolerance question is included. The importance of seating systems which attenuate vehicle vibration is demonstrated. 1972 SAE Transactions 720002. A Prediction Model of Human Torso Volitional Mobility. Don B. Chaffin, Rodney K. Schutz and Richard G. Snyder, The University of Michigan. Empirical models are presented which predict the three- space position of the torso when responding to reaches with the right arm. Models were derived which specify torso position in terms of the spacial location of 10 surface markers. These markers were positioned over palpable skeletal points of the spine and shoulder girdle. The necessary data were obtained through photogrammetric procedures utilizing four orthogonal cameras. The inde- pendent (input) variables to these models are the coor- dinates of the reach target. A supplementary, slightly more accurate, set of models was also derived in which the set of independent variables was enlarged to include the an- thropometric dimensions of the subject. The second, concurrent phase of the analysis resulted in the derivation of a set of models which describes the configuration of the internal, torso skeletal system. The vector distances and angles between external surface markers and internal bone articulations points can be calculated from these models. A radiographic procedure using orthogonal or oblique x-ray photographs was used to generate the required data. The relative advantages of the present empirical models over the traditional heuristic, hard-link biomechanical models is discussed. Discussion: Robert P.

Dugoff, U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. This paper describes two motion simulators and their application to research in whole-body vibration. One is a four-degree-of-freedom device capable of producing vertical, pitch, roll, and yaw motions. The other is a single-degree-of-freedom device that produces motion in the horizontal direction. Both have been used to acquire information on whole-body and visual response to vibration. Frequency response plots of some of the acquired data are presented. Procedures for assessing the severity of human vibration responses in terms of absorbed power are described and discussed. Brief descriptions are presented of studies that made use of the equipment and methodology discussed. The first is a concept evaluation of a proposed vehicle for use on the lunar surface. The second is a hardware evaluation of two seating devices for use in a wheeled vehicle in severe terrain environment. 720004. Pedal Operation by the Seated Operator. K. H. Eberhard Kroemer, Aerospace Medical Res. Lab., Wright-Patterson AFB. This paper attempts to serve three purposes: 1. To summarize the open scientific literature on muscular force applicable to pedals, and on the efficiency of foot motions on or between pedals depending on the body support and the body posture of the seated operator. 2. To discuss the applicability of such studies in automobile (or other equipment) design, especially to the design, selection, and arrangement of foot-operated controls. 3. To point out that for most conventional vehicles and equipment, modes of seating, and of pedal arrange- ment and operation follow laregely common experience and tradition, and only partly scientific findings. For new man-machine systems, new solutions seem possible. 720005. The Human Buttocks in Sitting: Pressures, Patterns, and Palliatives. H. T. E. Hertzberg, Aerospace Medical Research Lab. After a brief description of relevant buttock structure, the author presents summary data on buttock size, tuberosity locations, and other dimensions needed for improved seat design, as measured from a sample of 35 young males chosen to approximate the range of USAF flying per- sonnel. Summary load patterns for two angles of seat back (pelvic inclination) are shown, and suggestions to reduce the discomfort of long-continued sitting are made. Curves and data for successful USAF seat surfaces are presented. Citing recent increases in American body size, the author calls for an anthropometric survey on a national sample in which numerous data needed for automotive and other industrial design would be acquired. 1972 SA E Transactions 720006. Development of Biomechanical Manikins for Measuring Seat Comfort. Jiro Kohara, Univer- sity of Chiba (Japan); and Tokio Sugi, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan). A manikin that can simulate the final stable posture of a seated human being has been developed in order to evaluate seat comfort quantitatively and to analyze the biomechanical characteristics of seats. J-SAE 3DM, a manikin with the dimensions of a Japanese 50th percentile person made to imitate the SAE three-dimensional standardized in SAE J826 was em- ployed as the original; three additional joints were installed on its back pan to make it flexible. In this paper, the authors' view of seat comfort, on which their study was based, in summarized. Then the 77</page><page sequence="3">720007-720012 progress of development and various experimental results showing the usability of the final model are outlined. 720007. Measuring the Effect of Spark Plug and Ignition System Design on Engine Performance. Richard R. Burgett, Joseph M. Leptich and Karma V. S. Sangwan, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. Cycle-to-cycle combustion variation and engine emission levels are now recognized as effective indicators of engine performance. A system was devised that directly indicates combustion variation by measuring the work produced in a combustion chamber for every power stroke; it also continuously monitors engine emission level. Using this system, then, the effects of spark plug and ignition system variables on engine performance were examined. These criteria were employed in investigating the effects of spark plug gap size, gap location, electrode size and gap geometry, and the effects of spark timing, spark duration, and spark energy at various engine air-fuel ratios. In addition to studying each variable independently, statis- tically designed experiments to investigate interactions between the variables were conducted. Although all the variables had measurable effects on engine performance, the most significant were spark plug gap size, gap location, spark timing, and spark duration. Discussion: A. H. Ball, Joseph Lucas Ltd.; Terrence Cadmus, Champion Spark Plug Co.; L. H. Haase, Ford Motor Co.; and J. B. Soltau, Joseph Lucas Ltd.; Author's closure 1972 SAE Transactions 720008. Application Engineering of a Maintenance-Free Capacitor Discharge Ignition System. J. T. Hardin and N. F. Sieja, The Prestolite Co. An ignition system with a 3500 h life capability has been developed for tactical military vehicles. An extensive test program was used to develop a capacitor discharge ignition system, composed of a capacitor energy storage system, a noncontacting metal detector timing system, a special coil, shielded ignition cable, and surface gap spark plugs. It provides ignition performance advantages, a single spark plug heat range, and is compatible with 4-, 6-, and 8-cyl military engines. The characteristics of various ignition systems were studied on the bench and on the dynamometer over a wide range of engine operation. The final design's capability to provide engine performance equivalent to the standard system was verified. The advantages and disadvantages of each ignition type is discussed. 720009. A Study of Erosion-Corrosion in Aluminum Radiator Alloys by Jet Impingement. W. H. Anthony and J. M. Popplewell, Olin Corp. The frequent occurrence of erosion-corrosion attack in service failures of aluminum radiators suggests the need for a rapid test which will predict erosion-corrosion susceptibility in aluminum alloys under conditions simu- lating those in an actual radiator. This paper describes a multijet test apparatus which has been used to compare the erosion-corrosion resistance of aluminum alloys in antifreeze solutions at 200 F. Impingement velocities of up to 130 ft/s have been used. The effect of short-term jet impingement has been found to produce a mode of erosion-corrosion attack similar to that found in a 6951 alloy radiator after 40,000 miles of service. Attack appears to progress through several distinct stages starting with the development of a high density of pits which eventually become coalesced together at points of very high impingement velocity. The rate of attack has been found to be dependent on alloy composition and properties, jet velocity, and metal surface condition. The test would indicate that the susceptibility of aluminum radiator alloys to erosion-corrosion failure can be predicted by the effects of high-speed antifreeze jets produced with the equipment described. 720010. Vacuum Brazing of Aluminum. H. K. Herr, Reynolds Metals Co. Fluxless vacuum brazing is now a commercially feasible process for joining a large variety of aluminum heat exchangers, particularly the common automotive and aircraft types. The advantages offered by this process include: improved quality of the brazed assemblies, lower production costs, elimination of air and stream pollution, elimination of safety hazards, and the potential for impçoved product designs. This paper describes the process used to vacuum braze aluminum, analyses the overall cost of the process, discusses selection of alloys suitable for vacuum brazing, and deals with the application of the process to commer- cial production. 720011. Development of New Solder Alloys for Auto- motive Application. R. E. Beai, I IT Research Institute. Automotive radiators are currently used near their maximum operating capabilities. New temperature and pressure demands require stronger soldered joints to prevent failures. Quantitative data demonstrate a direct relation between soldering parameters and mechanical properties. Several new solders and conventional alloys have been examined. Highest strengths are achieved with silver- bearing solders, especially at elevated temperatures. A new alloy with 3.0-3.8 Sn, 1.2-1.5 Ag, balance Pb, showed 100% strength improvement which should raise current reliability and make the soldered radiator viable at higher operating temperatures and pressures. 1972 SAE Transactions 720012. New Light-Weight Design Copper and Brass Radiator Performance Compared With Produc- tion Radiators. F. Lustwerk and Robert Batson, Lytron Inc. As part of a continuing program to improve performance of copper and brass radiators and thus obtain improved 78</page><page sequence="4">720013-720017 material utilization, heat transfer performance of a standard cross-flow automobile radiator and stresses existing during operation were measured under normal operating conditions and at various other temperatures and pressures. It is well know that heat transfer per- formance of a radiator can be improved by raising the operating temperature and, thereby, the saturation tem- perature. Therefore, if the operating pressure and tem- perature can be raised while holding stresses within allowable limits by improved design with little or no increase in cost, a smaller, lighter and less expensive radiator should result. The standard radiator performance was evaluated using brittle coat testing, strain gages located at a number of points on the surface, and thermocouples at many points on the radiator surface. Measurements were made under various air flow, air temperature, coolant flow, coolant temperature, and pressure conditions. Knowledge gained from the data obtained in the series of tests was applied to the design and construction of a new radiator intended for use on a prototype automobile. The new radiator has cylindrical tanks and a single deep tube now. Preliminary results show that peak stresses in the new radiator are reduced by a factor of about 6 compared to the standard radiator. Thus, the new radiator can be operated at 22 psig while stresses in the standard radiator exceeded the yield point at this operating pressure. The new design will permit operation at far higher pressure levels with substantially hydrostatic conditions in the radiator. Production processes used on the new radiator can be economically applied to mass production of radiators for automotive application and also permit simple, in-field repair. 720013. On Computer Directed Calibration of Gas Tur- bine Engine Controls. David C. Thoman, Bendix Aerospace and Electronics Co. The application of time-sharing computation to the calibration of aircraft gas turbine engine controls is described. The control is, typically, a hydromechanical unit composed of sensors, speed governors, servo systems, sleeve and pilot valves, feedback or follow-up devices, cams, and metering systems. Its complexity and required set-in accuracy presents a challenge to even the most experienced calibration personnel. A high-speed time- sharing computer is brought to the service of these personnel to direct the adjustment process and to provide diagnostic and prognostic information. 720014. The Use of Time Sharing in Engineering Design Analysis. Russell F. Henke, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. The increasingly widespread application of time-shared computer programs to significant engineering design analysis problems is due to several factors: first, the convenience, economy, and time-saving capability inher- ent in the basic concept of time sharing; second, the growing acceptance among engineers of utilizing the computer as an everyday tool; third, the appearance of sophisticated applications packages written especially for the engineer in his language and dedicated to solving real problems. The paper is concerned with mechanical design analysis, an area heretofore generally neglected by commercial programmers. The use of an integrated package of mechanical design analysis time-sharing programs is detailed, including example solutions for several real-world problems. The use of programs for static deflection, stress, natural frequency, and mode shape determination is outlined. Fundamental program assumptions, ease of use, and actual experimental cor- relations are emphasized. The paper provides a compre- hensive view both of the past success and of the potential of remote computer usage in engineering design analysis. 720015. Automated Design System. A. J. Foland and R. Razi, Bendix Computer Graphics. A new computer-related system that can be used by design engineers to perform both simple and complex descriptive geometry calculations is described. The sys- tem, which requires no special programming knowledge on the part of the engineer, includes a free-cursor digitizer and a "menu" of calculations which are used in con- junction with conventional drawings to define various computations for the computer. The system eliminates the normal problems of graphic-to-digital conversion asso- ciated with existing methods of computer-aided design, thus freeing the engineer from hours of tedious and routine work. 720016. SPREAD - A Computer Program for Designing Flat Springs. John R. Wolberg, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology; and Eric H. Nickerson, Burndy Corp. SPREAD allows the user to perform complex stress and force analysis with little or no mathematical or computer experience. Extensive use of the program has shown that the resulting springs are much less prone to redesign than springs designed in the classical manner. The designs are usually more efficient, and the resulting product is closer to optimum when the program is used. The total savings in time, money, and effort have often been dramatic. 720017. Applications and Properties of a Specially Proc- essed Nitrogenized AISI 1010 Steel with Con- sideration of Strength in a Completed Vehicle. Bernard S. Levy, Inland Steel Research Labs. The static and dynamic strength properties and the fabricability of a specially processed, nitrogenized AISI 1010 steel are discussed. Typical applications are pre- sented, and it is indicated that one important area of application for this steel is in parts that preserve the integrity of the passenger compartment to enhance safety. In addition, a method is described by which an estimate 79</page><page sequence="5">720018-720023 80 can be made of the static strength of the steel after it has been fabricated and installed in a vehicle. 720018. Interstitial Free Sheet Steel - Applications and Performance. J. A. Elias and R. E. Hook, Armco Steel Corp. Interstitial free sheet steel containing columbium (nio- bium) has been used in a variety of difficult deep drawing applications in the automotive and appliance industries. Performance data have shown a significant increase in deep drawability for this steel over drawing quality aluminum-killed steel. Breakage rates in difficult deep drawn parts have been reduced, often dramatically. One or more anneals between draws have been eliminated and better finished parts have been formed. Laboratory research trials have shown that one or more drawing steps of a multi-stage draw can be eliminated in a complex part. 720019. A New Method of Predicting the Formability of Materials. A. S. Kasper and P. J. VanderVeen, Chrysler Corp. The paper presents a new method, based on standard laboratory cup tests, for predicting the formability of materials; in the example provided, the forming potentials of four new materials are shown. The properties of stretchability and drawability, which are the principal factors defining a material's forming limits, may be assessed using the Olsen spherical cup test and the Swift flat-bottomed cup test. In the shape analysis procedure described, the minimum amount of deforma- tion needed to fix a desired shape is determined. Then necessary adjustments to tooling for optimum sheet metal usage are made based on calculations from a new type of chart showing stretch forming ratio and draw forming ratio, providing a comparison of the formabilities of a number of materials. It is shown that, in the absence of reliable cup testing data, values can be obtained using laboratory tensile testing results; this is possible because computer-determined correlations of certain tensile pa- rameters to standard cup test results have been made. 1972 SA E Transactions 720020. E-Cell Applications for the Automotive Industry. Marshall A. Williams and Branko Vranich, EDAX International, Inc. Memory and nonvolatile properties of the E-Cell makes it suitable for monitoring a variety of functions of a moving vehicle. Properly programmed, an E-Cell can control engine maintenance periods. It is less than 1/10 in3 in size and weighs less than 1/10 oz. This small size facilitates the packaging of a sizable monitoring system in a practical volumetric space. The E-Cell, by virture of its construction, shows no visible signs relating to the amount of information contained in the unit. In addition, the scaling factors used in the supporting circuitry makes the E-Cell compatible with any monitoring program where strict security is required. 1972 SA E Transactions 720021. Department of Transportation Commercial Ve- hicle Road Checks and the Results of Such Inspections. D. W. Morrison and H. E. Seiff, Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety, FHA. Inspection and maintenance of motor vehicles are nec- essary to insure that they are kept in safe condition to operate over the highways. Federal regulations require motor vehicles engaged in interstate and foreign com- merce to be systematically inspected and maintained. As a check to determine whether vehicles under the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety's jurisdiction are being inspected and maintained, our field staff conducts inspections at road-check locations around the country. These inspections indicate that many vehicles are not being properly inspected and maintained. 720022. An Experimental Determination of the Instan- taneous Potential Radiant Heat Transfer Within an Operating Diesel Engine. P. Flynn, Cummins Engine Co., Masatake Mizusawa, Komatsu Ltd. (Japan); O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, University of Wisconsin. An instrument was developed to measure absolute monochromatic infrared emission rates within an oper- ating diesel engine. The instrument and data reduction system were developed for use in obtaining potential instantaneous rates of radiant heat transfer within an operating engine. Data are presented for variations of: engine speed, fuel-air ratio, fuel injection timing, intake air pressure, fuel injector nozzle spray patterns, fuel cetane numbers, fuel family, and fuel additives (tetraeythl lead and amyl nitrate). Also presented is an empirical correlation for instan- taneous radiant heat transfer rates and some conclusions regarding radiant emission sources within the engine and their relationships to combustion processes.

Tatsu Oguri and Shigewo Inaba, Yokohama National University (Japan). Heat transfer from gases to the wall of the combustion chamber of a diesel engine consists of two modes of heat transmission: convection and radiation. The quantitative relation between the two components has been directly measured only to a small extent in diesel engines. In order to prepare the derivation of an equation that would express more accurately crank angle flowed from the gases to the cylinder wall was measured experimentally in diesel engines. The radiant heat flux was extracted from the above-mentioned total heat flux by using a thermocouple covered with a sapphire window. Integrating the instantaneous values of both radiant and total heat fluxes, the ratio of the former flux to the latter was determined versus the value of indicated mean effective pressure.

Detailed results which may be used for design purposes are presented comparing the effectiveness of alternative methods of piston cooling for highly rated engines. These results, which have been obtained from rig and engine running investigations covering a wide range of variables, are not found to be adequately correlated by existing pipe flow heat transfer equations, which are given. Details of how to choose a cooling method are presented. 1972 SA E Transactions 720025. Steady and Cyclic Thermal Stresses of Diesel Engine Pistons - A Photothermoelastic Study and Calculation. M. Mihara, T. Kokubu and K. Hirata, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Ja- pan). A photothermoelastic analysis was used to investigate the steady thermal stresses of the pistons of 4-cycle, high- speed diesel engines, and the cyclic temperature swing of the piston surface in relation to the cyclic thermal stresses was investigated with a digital computer method. The investigation revealed that axisymmetric analysis as an approximation was enough to estimate the steady thermal stresses, and that a major cause of the stress was the radial thermal gradient in the top of the pistons. The cyclic temperature swing and cyclic thermal stress, calculated in connection with time-averaged heat flux, reached considerably higher value than that calcu- lated by usually used equations of instantaneous heat- transfer coefficients. 720026. Experimental Determination of Airflow Patterns in Piston Engines with Induction Swirl. K. H. Huebner, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and A. T. McDonald, Purdue University. A dynamic model of a piston engine has been developed to study cylinder air motion during the intake stroke. Flow visualization and paddle wheels were used to study gross flow patterns. Detailed maps of velocity at several instants during the intake stroke were obtained using hot-wire instrumentation. The model and measurement technique are described briefly. Results are presented for inlet swirl generated by streamlined port and shrouded valve configurations. Gross swirl measurements made with paddle wheels are compared with those computed from the velocity profile measurements. The effects of engine speed, compression ratio, and measuring location in the cylinder are dis- cussed. The results show that measuring devices must be selected carefully to produce reliable data. Gross swirl measurements must be interpreted with caution, using guidelines presented here. 720027. A Rational Approach for Calculation of Heat Transfer in Diesel Engines. G. Sitkei, Technical University of Budapest; and G. V. Ramanaiah, Central Mechanical Engineering Research In- stitute (India). This paper proposes a new equation for calculating instantaneous heat transfer in internal combustion en- gines. The equation constitutes expressions of heat transfer due to convection, and gas and flame radiation. In the term for convective heat transfer three sets of parameters appear: operating parameters (pressure in the combustion chamber, mean piston speed, gas tempera- ture), and engine parameter (equivalent diameter of the cylinder), and a constant that takes swirl velocities (at the time when combustion starts) into account. Consideration of gas radiation and data obtained on flame radiation make the equation broadly complete, scientifically sound, and universally applicable. 1972 SA E Transactions 720028. Experimental Verification of Frequency Param- eter in Plate-Type Viscous Flow Meters in Air Consumption Measurements of Internal Com- bustion Engines. H. Sezgen and M. Özsoy, Middle East Technical University (Turkey). Precise air consumption measurement is of vital impor- tance in the development of internal combustion engines. Considerable errors are introduced in measurements of airflow rates when conventional flow meters are used under pulsating flow conditions. Plate-type viscous flow air meters have been used satisfactorily under certain speed ranges. But it was found that the linear relationship between the flow rate and the pressure drop across the viscous flow air meter deviated at high engine speeds under the pulsating flow conditions found in internal combustion engines. Viscous flow meters have been designed using two main equations-pressure drop and Reynolds number equations. Deviation from linear relationship at higher speeds has led to an attempt at experimental verification of the frequency parameter theoretically analyzed pre- viously. Experimental results have shown that there is an exponential relationship between the frequency parameter and the distance between two adjacent plates of a viscous flow air meter which has to be considered in design calculations. 720029. Analog Computation of Pressure Evolution in the Internal Combustion Engines. K. Aprameyan, M. Murat and R. Vichnievsky, Universite de Paris VI. A philosophy is proposed that there might exist a definite correlation between the engine parameter variations and the Fourier coefficients of different harmonics of the corresponding pressure diagrams and their derivatives. It is thus possible to establish the law of variation of Fourier coefficients with respect to a particular parameter. From these correlations, it is possible to predict a cycle, taking into consideration all the important parameters - injection timing, load, speed, flow processes, etc. Harmonic analyses developed in our laboratory are based on the principles of analog computation, to get results instantaneously, while the engine is running on the test bed. 81</page><page sequence="7">720030-720036 82 720030. A Comparison of World Braking Standards with Reference to the Development of Japanese Brak- ing Standards. Kazuhiko Aoki, Akebono Brake Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan). A new Committee on Japanese Automobile Standards for Brakes has been established to issue standards covering road tests, dynamometer tests, nomenclature, etc. This paper discusses several of these. The Committee also reviewed the regulations and standards of various coun- tries for comparison purposes. In order to have rational standards, ample data on vehicle usage, analysis of brake characteristics, and study of basic human engineering will be needed. Correlation among road tests, dynamometer tests, and test equipment must be established. Amalgamation of various national standards into a single international standard is desirable goal. 1972 SA E Transactions 720031. Design and Development of an Hydraulic Pow- ered Wheel Slide Protection System. Robin A. Cochrane, Girling Ltd. A Wheel Slide Protection system is considered in which a hydraulic power source is used to modulate braking effort at each wheel of a vehicle. The reasons for selecting this type of power source are discussed, together with other parameters employed in the design of the system. System operation is described with particular empha- sis on the functioning of the hydraulic actuators and their response to electrical control signals. Evaluation has been carried out on different vehicles over a wide range of surfaces. Certain observations are made as a result of these tests. 720032. Evaluation of the Use of Automotive Braking Systems During a 7300 Mile Cross Country Trip. R. W. Radliński, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Use of braking systems in four passenger vehicles was evaluated during a 7300 mile trip across the United States. This paper presents an analysis of braking system temperatures and torques and vehicle speeds and decel- erations that were measured during the trip. Similar measurements made during SAE fade and recovery tests are also presented and a comparison of severity levels is given. Requirements for specifying braking system per- formance at temperatures higher than those currently considered are discussed. The need for a new test to insure that vehicles will perform satisfactorily in service with approved brake fluids is shown. 720033. Occupant Protection in Rear-End Collisions. J. W. Melvin and J. H. McElhaney, The University of Michigan. This paper discusses the problem of occupant protection in severe rearend collisions from the standpoint of high performance seat structures and head restraints. Consid- eration is given to both fixed head restraints and to déployable head restraints. Two-dimensional computer simulations of occupant kinematics in a variety of rearend collisions are utilized to provide initial performance criteria for head restraint design configurations. The resulting prototype system underwent a test and devel- opment program on an impact sled. The results of the various prototype performances and general criteria for high performance head restraint systems are discussed. 720034. Performance Evaluation of Automobile Head Restraints. J. W. Garrett and D. F. Morris, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. Accident cases involving cars without head restraints are compared with cars having this device to evaluate the effectiveness of head restraints, their position when impact occurred, and to provide some details concerning the relationship between occupant position, seat back dam- age, and cervical injury. A reduction in nondangerous cervical injury was associated with the head restraint group. However, due to small numbers this could not be confirmed statistically. Approximately 73% of the adjustable head rests were in their lowest position. The position of the occupant on the seat strongly influenced injury. Larger amounts of rearward rotation of the seat back were associated with lower injury severity than limited rotation. 720035. Comparative Analysis of Crash Sensors. Trevor O. Jones, Oliver T. McCarter and Robert N. Oglesby, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Techniques and principles for evaluating and comparing various crash sensor concepts are discussed. The trade-off criteria include: crash/rough-road discrimination, target lethality, component reliability, zone of protection, envi- ronmental susceptibility, and other criteria. Within the context of hardware performance characteristics, cur- rently prominent devices are described including: inertial mass, spring mass, piezoelectric and piezoresistive accel- erometers, radar, sonar, and laser predictive sensors, and bumper mounted detectors. An example of the assessment method is presented, comparing an inertial mass and a spring mass detector. 720036. Mathematical Model of an Airbag for a Three- Dimensional Occupant Simulation. Albert I. King, Clifford C. Chou and James A. Mackinder, Wayne State University. A mathematical model of an airbag restraint system for automobile drivers, including the simulation of the simultaneous collapse of the steering column, has been developed. The model is designed to work in conjunction with a three-dimensional occupant model. It is capable of assessing the relative effects of airbag size, pressure, deployment rate, venting area, contact force, steering column collapse force, and column collapse distance. The results of the model are compared with experimental runs in which anthropometric dummies were used as test</page><page sequence="8">720037-720042 subjects. Good correlation was obtained for torso kine- matics. The model can be conveniently used for a parametric study to aid the design of airbag restraint systems. 720037. Plastic Film Tapes for Electrical Insulation. Joel R. Urban, 3M Co. In this day of specialization it is essential that electrical design engineers have a general background in insulating materials. This paper intends to provide some guidelines for the selection of proper insulation materials. The properties and construction of various types of electrical grade pressure sensitive tapes is discussed. The importance of compatibility, the consideration of cor- rosion, and the mechanical, electrical, thermal, envi- ronmental exposure, cost, and safety aspects of a given application are emphasized. 1972 SAE Transactions 720038. Electrical Properties of Glass and Asbestos Fortified Thermoplastic Resins. John E. Theberge, LNP Corp. Mechanical and electrical properties of 22 glass- and asbestos-fortified thermoplastic resin systems are pre- sented. Large increases in tensile and flexural strength are noted with the glass- and asbestos-fortified nylon com- pounds; increases for other fortified resins are also qualitatively detailed. Flexural modulus data also dem- onstrate the ability of fortifiers to increase rigidity dramatically. Unnotched izod impact strengths are gen- erally reduced by addition of fiber fortifiers, while notched izod impact strengths are increased for some resin systems and decreased for others. Increases in heat deflection are generally realized. The d-c electric properties of dielectric strength and arc resistance are generally enhanced in glass fiber- fortified thermoplastic resins. The a-c electric properties of dielectric constant and dissipation factor are similarly increased. Both increases and decreases in volume resistivity data are noted with the addition of fiber fortifiers. Slightly reduced volume resistivities and in- creased dissipation factors at 60 Hz are noted with asbestos-fortified nylon resins. The addition of flame-retardant additives to fortified thermoplastic resins results generally in reduced physical and electrical properties. 1972 SAE Transactions 720039. Thermosetting Plastics for Automotive Electrical Insulation. W. A. Dannels, Durez Div., Hooker Chemical Corp. Thermosetting plastics are the only insulation materials that meet all of the requirements of the high-voltage system - "coil, rotor, and distributor cap." This is due not only to their electrical properties of insulation resistance and arc resistance at elevated temperatures, but also to their dimensional stability, flame, and heat resistance. Increased temperatures under the hood, and more demanding ignition efficiencies to meet the performance and environmental objectives have led to the development of improved thermo-setting materials. Performance stan- dards and meaningful testing must keep pace with these changes. In the low-voltage system, thermosetting molding compounds are used for applications such as connectors, switch parts, solenoid covers or cases, commutators, and brush holders. For this type of application, although electrical properties are not too demanding, the parts must be structurally sound and dimensionally stable. They have to be produced at a low cost in an automatic system, and hold up under any abuse of assembly or end use. Many recent developments in thermosetting molding equipment and tooling methods have reduced cost and scrap. Some molding operations can be tied in with assembly line procedures. Thermoset materials are being developed to keep up with processing changes. Hopefully, all of this will result in better productivity and improved product reliability. 720040. A Water- Activated Lead-Acid Dry-Charged Bat- tery. John P. Badger, The Prestolite Co. A water-activable, dry-charged lead-acid automotive battery is described in which concentrated sulfuric acid is immobilized and stored in a phenolic foam block within each cell. Design and construction features are described, and the method of activating the battery with water is outlined. Battery performance is described, and shelf life is measured by comparing préchargé performance of the water-activable battery with that of a conventional design as a function of battery age. The new fiberglass reinforced polyethylene thin-wall battery container is described. Physical properties are compared with typical copolymer and hard rubber containers. 720041. A New Manufacturing Method for Lead- Acid Storage Batteries. V. M. Halsall and R. R. Wiethaup, Globe-Union Inc. A new process for the preparation of lead-acid batteries has been developed in response to problems associated with investory maintenance of wet batteries and the processing and performance of dry charge batteries. Unique steps are a modified formation treatment followed by removal of most of the electrolyte by the use of an accelerative force, such as that generated by a centrifuge, to produce a charged and tested finished battery in a moist condition. The new product has superior properties that enable the manufacturer to store and activate it within the battery plant to service the wet battery market or to ship it to the dry charge market as a high- performance long-shelf-life product. 720042. Teaming Plastics and Automation for a Superior Battery. John W. Brodhacker, Howard C. Burns and Albert L. Fox, Automotive Div., ESB Inc. 83</page><page sequence="9">720043-720048 84 The new "S-T-A-R" battery design takes advantage of the properties of thermoplastics in manufacturing a superior battery having the shortest practical electrical path. The injection-molded three-piece construction provides a lighter, stronger battery case and the new design concept adapted to automated assembly provides increased resis- tance to vibration and improved starting power. The new design concept coupled with automatic assembly also makes possible improved quality assurance, a most important factor in meeting the cost effectiveness and uniformity objective originally conceived. This paper describes such key elements of the design as the fastening of molded-in intercell connectors, molded-in high-profile bushings and terminal posts, and the three-piece construction. The automated assembly operation is described in detail, with individual treatment of sleeve-group assembly, group positioner, heat-sealing reservoirs, first leakage tester, plate lug fusion to sleeve inserts, electric shorts testing, heat-sealing covers, post fusion, and final leakage tester. 720043. General Purpose Automotive Vehicle Perform- ance and Economy Simulator (GPSIM). William C. Waters, General Motors Engineering Staff. GPSIM is an automotive vehicle simulator that computes the operating conditions of the engine and transmission and the performance and economy of the vehicle as the vehicle is operated in a prescribed manner. The program can simulate a large variety of vehicles. The vehicle to be simulated is described by the user with a combination of steady-state test results and vehicle specifications. The simulator makes predictions from limited data for proposed vehicle combinations, or it makes more accurate computations based on component tests for production vehicles. This paper tells how the simulator computes the operating conditions and how these computations com- pare with test results. It also describes how engineers using the simulator have decreased developmental lead time, decreased the number of full vehicle tests, and focused developmental work on the best alternatives. The techniques that can be applied in other areas such as the data library control and the command language are described. 1972 SA E Transactions 720044. Power Train-Vehicle Modeling to Simulate Shifting Transients of Off-Highway Vehicles. Larry G. Koch, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Analytic modeling and analog computer simulation techniques are presented for determining power train transient responses excited by clutch-actuated gear shifts. A method for describing the dynamics of a transmission arrangement having several clutches and interconnected planetary gear sets is considered in detail. Simulation model testing is directed toward optimizing system design parameters and evaluating power train component capability and vehicle shift-feel. Data reduc- tion techniques applied to model responses of torque and speed will yield appropriate spectrums representative of simulated work cycle. The spectrum data are used to predict hours of life for gears, bearings, and driveshafts, according to cumulative fatigue damage theory. 1972 SA E Transactions 720045. Modal Modeling Techniques for Vehicle Shake Analysis. James C. Davis, Chevrolet Div., Gen- " eral Motors Corp. A modal model is a concise and convenient way to describe the dynamic characteristics of a structural subsystem of a vehicle, such as a frame or a body structure. Techniques have been developed for obtaining a modal model by fitting the model to measured frequency responses. These modal models are then used as "building blocks" and coupled to mathematical models of the vehicle's other subsystems (the suspension, the engine mounting system, etc.) to simulate the total vehicle system. This paper explains the basic theory of modal modeling, including the concepts of mode shape scaling and residual compliances. Some sample vehicle shake simulation studies are also discussed. 720046. Dynamic Testing and Computer Analysis of Automotive Frames. Jay K. Hay, Structural Dynamics Research Corp.; and J. Michael Blew, United States Steel Corp. A method for quick and accurate static and dynamic analysis of automotive frame designs through use of a structural analysis computer program supplemented by empirical test data is discussed in this paper. A special beam finite element used in the computer program permits more comprehensive and detailed structural description. Specific sub-programs and testing techniques are described briefly. Also presented is a correlation between computer-predicted and actual experimental results for static deflection, and natural frequencies and mode shapes of a representative automotive frame. 720047. Fiat Laboratory Road Simulator. Enzo Franchini, Fiat Auto-Avio Laboratories (Italy). A large facility has been developed in the Fiat Structure Laboratory for performing indoor the fatigue tests usually run on the road. The hydraulic equipment potentiality is such that the severe stresses encountered on a very bad African road can be reproduced on a fully laden truck. The equipment is divided in two independent sections allowing to carry out, simultaneously, also vibration tests on complete vehicles. 720048. Continuing Education - Bring Them Back Alive. J. M. Biedenbach, RCA Corp. This paper describes an industrial training program designed to bring continuing engineering education programs to several thousand engineers distributed in plants over a wide geographical area on a flexible time</page><page sequence="10">720049-720054 schedule, using a practicing engineer's time effectively and efficiently while utilizing good teaching and learning techniques. Using video tape as the teaching media and supplementing this with textbooks, especially developed studying guide materials, visual aids designed for TV presentations, and an associate instructor at the plant location to act in a resource capacity, a successful engineering personnel education program has been devel- oped economically that can be used at any plant location. Other industries could utilize the techniques described to bring quality engineering-updating programs to the majority of their engineers, as could universities, to take graduate-level programs to locations distant from the campus at a time convenient to the engineers involved. 720049. Capitalize on Your Own Resources - Bootstrap Training. Frederick C. Burgwardt, Xerox Corp. Most companies have a very tangible resource which can be mobilized to provide effective in-house education and training. Frequently overlooked are the very specialists who were hired to perform key roles in the development of new products or services. An in-house training program can provide a profitable outlet for this potential. This paper describes the tech- niques of harnessing your resources, investigates the benefits of bootstrap training, and provides insight into specific administrative activities required for successful program operation. 720050. Education for Industry - A Challenge. Harley J. Anderson, General Motors Institute. Continuing engineering educational programs provided at General Motors Institute are described. Resident and in-plant educational programs are discussed which are provided for maintenance, technician, and engineering personnel. Some of the changes in emphasis occurring in electrical technology today due to developments in solid-state electronics are outlined. 720051. A Stratified Charge Multifuel Military Engine - A Progress Report. E. Mitchell, M. Alperstein, J. M. Cobb and C. H. Faist, Texaco Research Center. This paper is a progress report on the conversion of the military L-141 gasoline engine to the Texaco Controlled- Combustion System and the evaluation of naturally aspirated and turbocharged installations in an M-151 vehicle. Relative to the standard gasoline vehicle, signif- icant improvement in fuel economy with low exhaust emission levels were demonstrated as were the multifuel capabilities and excellent cold starting facility of the combustion concept. Possibilities for further improvement in TCCS exhaust quality through adjustment of operating parameters and add-on devices are also presented. This work was done under contract to the U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Command. 720052. Exhaust Emission Control by the Ford Pro- grammed Combustion Process - PROCO. A. Simko, M. A. Choma and L. L. Repko, Ford Motor Co. The Ford Stratified Charge Combustion Process (FCP) which utilizes direct fuel injection has been further developed for reduced exhaust emissions. With air throttling, exhaust gas recirculation, low thermal inertia exhaust maniford, and a noble metal catalyst, low gaseous emissions have been achieved at low mileage on a V4 ton military utility truck with acceptable fuel economy and driveability. Dynamometer and vehicle emission data and details of the fuel injection and air-fuel ratio control system are described. 1972 SA E Transactions 720053. A Rankine Cycle Engine with Rotary Heat Exchangers. William A. Doerner, Roy J. Dietz, Oral R. VanBuskirk, Stanley B. Levy, Philip J. Rennolds and Max F. Bechtold, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. A Rankine cycle engine is described that comprises close-coupled annular components (boiler, nozzle ring, and air condenser) corotating counter to an interior turbine wheel on a common axis. A stationary annular combustor surrounds the rotating boiler. Test runs up to 18 hp demonstrated several advantages for this kind of Rankine engine, which utilizes centrifugal force to achieve: boiler compactness, air condenser compactness (viscous drag air pumping), automatic condensate return (no separate pump), control simplicity, and few moving parts. The organic working fluid used does not support combustion and has low physiological reactivity in preliminary tests. The results appear significant for uses requiring low-polluting, quiet engines. 720054. The Effect of Cure Variations on Chemical and Functional Properties of Resin Bonded Friction Materials. Marvin H. Weintraub, Arnold E. Anderson and Roy L. Gealer, Ford Motor Co. Several resin-bonded friction materials were used to establish the interrelationship between the resin-cure state and the functional properties. Pyrolytic gas chroma- tography (PGC) was used to measure the cure state of the resin and the Friction Assessment Screening Test (FAST) was used to characterize the friction and wear behavior of the materials. A phenolic resin, an oil-modified phenolic resin, and two different cashew resins were used as binders for simple resin-asbestos composites as used in brake linings. Both the PGC and functional properties of these materials showed systematic variations with changes in cure conditions of the resin. For all resins studied, a linear or bilinear relationship was found to exist between the PGC measured cure state of the resin and wear as measured by the FAST machine. A chemical kinetic model was successfully applied to relate both sample wear and a characteristic PGC peak of 85</page><page sequence="11">720055-720063 86 the resin to a unique function of cure time and temper- ature. 1972 SAE Transactions 720055. Approaching the Study of Fabricated Steel Disc Brake Rotors. Alex M. Wilson, Armco Steel Corp. After inconclusive tests of steel brake rotors on a high-performance demonstration car, Armco Steel Corp. decided to take a direct approach in evaluating the application of sheet carbon steels to disc brake construc- tion with production potential. Steel replicas of the normal cast-iron units were tested until an equivalent-performance carbon steel grade was found. Revised prototypes, with design changes were tested with standard industry testing procedures until performance advantages were observed. Efforts are being made to determine the most efficient and economical way to produce the newly optimized steel rotor. This report is an in-progress review of the direction and first results of this project. 720056. Characterization of Cast Iron Friction Surfaces. S. K. Rhee, R. T. DuCharme and W. M. Spurgeon, Bendix Corp. The friction and wear characteristics of automotive friction materials are strongly dependent on the compo- sition and microstructure of the rotor surface. In this study we investigated the compositional and micro- structural changes occurring in the surface layers of cast iron brake rotors during dynamometer tests with a typical organic friction material. Rotors were studied in the as-manufactured, lightly ground and sanded, and as- burnished conditions, as well as after 30 stops from 60 mph at a deceleration rate of 15 ft/s2. Optical and scanning electron microscopes were used to examine the surfaces. Minimum disturbance of the microstructure was found in the sanded surface, but the as-manufactured and burnished surfaces exhibited considerable disturbance. After the 30 stops the pearlite was transformed locally into martensite. Composition analysis of the burnished rotor surface showed high magnesium content. This was interpreted as asbestos or olivine from the lining, trans- ferred to and embedded in the drum surface. These findings indicate that cast iron rotors in brake systems are not, as commonly envisioned, passive, relatively unchanging parts of the friction couple (as compared with the friction material). Instead, they are metallurgically quite active. For this reason they must be well charac- terized during tests of friction materials. 720057. Determination of Water in Brake by Differential Near Infrared. E. Lee Haines, R. M. Hollingshead Corp. A rapid differential near-infrared method has been developed to measure the water absorption of heavy-duty brake fluids exposed to the atmosphere during transfer and filling operations. It is based on the -OH combination band at 5180 cm1. The method has been correlated with the SAE equilibrium reflux boiling point method and can be used in place of it to control line and finished package samples. 720058. Full-Power Hydraulic Brake System for Heavy- Duty Vehicles. Frank R. Schubert, Bendix- Westinghouse Automotive Air Brake Co. A full-power hydraulic brake system has been designed for heavy-duty commercial vehicles. This system uses a hydraulic pump and one or more accumulators to generate and store energy until it is needed for braking purposes. All components have been designed specifically for vehicle braking using standard brake fluid as the energy transfer medium. Mineral oil may be used in the system if the rubber parts are replaced with parts that are compatible with the fluid. 1972 SAE Transactions 720059. Air/Hydraulic Brake System for Heavy Duty Vehicles. George E. Ternent, The Bendix Corp. An air/hydraulic brake system is offered to power disc brakes on heavy-duty vehicles. The principal advantages are that the system is composed largely of service proven air brake components and the system would be compat- ible with existing air braked trailers. 720060. Disc Brakes for Heavy Duty Vehicles. M. E. Markert, The Bendix Corp. Disc brakes offer substantial improvements, in most cases, in performance when compared to drum brakes. Coupled with longer life, less and simplified maintenance, they should offer a most attractive brake system to truck owners and operators. Their application to the more demanding service conditions of trucks, compared to passenger cars, seems logical and necessary with greater potential gain than that which was experienced in lighter vehicles. A description of activities in developing such a brake system is given, pointing out the successes and problems encountered. 720061. Some Considerations Relative to Use of Sheet Molding Compound for Automotive Exterior Body Panels. William E. Tudor, Pontiac Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Fiberglass-reinforced thermoset materials offer significant advantages to the automotive body design engineer. Parts manufactured from this material possess substantially different properties than zinc or steel parts. These differences must be recognized by the part user so that necessary action may be taken to assure satisfactory part performance. 720063. Compression Molding of Glass Reinforced Ther- moplastic Laminate in Mechanical Stamping Presses. John S. Saczawa, Guide Lamp Div., General Motors Corp.; and James L. Slay ton, Chevrolet Div., General Motors Corp.</page><page sequence="12">720064-720073 Glass-reinforced thermoplastic laminate materials which are compression molded on mechanical stamping presses have recently been added to the designer's "bag of tricks." Guide Lamp Div., General Motors Corp., has manufac- tured production lamp housings with this material and process. Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp., is also manufacturing an emission control part for certain buses. Both Guide Lamp and Chevrolet have prototyped other parts using this concept. A production cycle time reduction over injection molding has been achieved. Presented here is a brief description of the process and a survey of results with these materials and molding techniques. The paper highlights the engineering studies leading to production realities at Chevrolet and Guide Lamp. Design considerations with these materials will also be given. 1972 SA E Transactions 720064. Reinforced Plastic Moldings for Automotive Applications. H. J. Sharp, Plastics Development Centre, GKN Ltd. This paper discusses the use of different types of plastics in automotive moldings and relates their importance to vehicle safety. The characteristics of each type are compared and their efficiency and stability as energy- absorbing materials are discussed from the viewpoint of un-reinforced and metal-reinforced structures. Charts are provided to show the extent of plastic use in Europe, the United Kingdom, and North and South America. 720066. System Engineering - A Window System. Paul Bullock, Engrg. &amp; Res. Office, Chrysler Corp. Many of the formal system engineering procedures and techniques developed in the aerospace industry have convenient informal application to the analysis, evalu- ation, and qualification of new automotive design. This paper describes such "systemization" from a product engineering viewpoint in the development of a hardtop window project. The project is traced through its several design and development stages; and the advantages of the system engineering approach, as well as some of the problems encountered, are explored. The paper concludes with a discussion of additional controls that would have been required to yield the full information recording/re- trieval capability demanded for complete system inte- gration on larger projects. 720069. Digitek Chassis Development for Fairchild Ex- perimental Safety Vehicle. Jon S. McKibben and David L. Grossman, Digitek Corp. The development of chassis components to satisfy both formal vehicle response specifications and practical requirements of acceptable passenger car performance was undertaken as a part of the Federal Experimental Safety Vehicle program. Since the formal specifications were new and had never been applied to passenger car chassis design, the necessary development effort was challenging and explored new areas of vehicle perform- ance optimization. The chassis configuration resulting from development for these new standards offers dramatic gains in several response and adhesion qualities, while retaining reasonable ride comfort. 720070. Experimental Safety Vehicle Crashworthiness Design. William J. Wingenbach and Robert Schwarz, AMF Inc. In developing the AMF Experimental Safety Vehicle, two of the major problems encountered involved limitation of passenger compartment intrusion during side impacts, and dissipation of vehicle kinetic energy during high-velocity front and rear impacts. A design solution to the first of these problems has been developed, which has as its basic element an aluminum honeycomb sandwich door panel. Several evolutionary models have been built and tested under both static and dynamic loading, including full-scale vehicle crashes. Actual behavior has agreed very well with analytically predicted behavior, enabling the side struc- ture system to meet ESV design goals. The solution developed for the second problem utilizes variable stroke hydraulic buffers to absorb the required energy. Bumper systems incorporating such buffers were tested successfully in various impact configurations at velocities of up to 50 mph. Both analysis and tests results led to the conclusion that the ESV crashworthiness goals can be met or exceeded with such systems. 1972 SA E Transactions 720071. Application of the Shock Response Spectrum to Some Automotive Crashworthiness Problems. Sol Davis, Fairchild Industries. The shock response spectrum is defined and applied to several areas of automotive design and crash test evalu- ation. An examination of the shock response spectra for several deceleration pulse shapes for vehicle front struc- ture design indicates that there is no "best" input pulse applicable to all occupant/restraint systems. However, in the 8-12 Hz frequency range of current occupant/restraint systems, the square wave does appear to offer significant reduction in peak deceleration response for the fully- restrained occupant. The shock response spectrum meth- od is also used to compare a velocity-sensitive versus constant-force front structure, deceleration data from different vehicles, and accelerometer data having different frequency limits. These examples illustrate that the shock response spectrum can be a useful tool for evaluating particular automotive crash data and for comparing the relative potential damage of deceleration pulses associated with different vehicle designs. 720073. Impact on Engineers and Engineering on People and Nature. Herbert G. Poertner, Engineering and Research Consultant. In fulfilling their roles in today's sensitive environments, engineers initiate a wide variety of reactions. The resulting consequences on the people who must interact with them, 87</page><page sequence="13">720074-720080 88 and on nature that must compete with them, are now subject to critical social evaluation in terms of awakening concerns for environment, community values, and social consciousness. Engineers and engineering educators should develop an analytical awareness of, and meth- odology for forecasting, the impacts of proposed engi- neering works and products. Their planning, designs, and actions should reflect a philosophy that places the highest of values on the enhancement of the quality of living. 720074. Role of the University in Training Engineers to Meet the Changing Needs of Society. Merl Baker, University of Missouri-Rolla. The university, in training engineers to meet the changing needs of society, must be more aggressive than in the past in anticipating changes before they occur and in per- forming research to determine whether anticipated changes are real or a passing fad. The professional societies must serve as the vehicle through which the university can work with government and employers of engineers to determine the present and future needs of society and to achieve a balance in quality and quantity of engineers and scientists to meet these needs. The United States, in the recent past, has almost had a monopoly among the nations of the world in advancing technology. But as other countries approach us, and in some cases exceed our capabilities, we must muster all our resources to have the kind of engineer and scientist that can compete with this very drastic change. 720076. Computer Simulation of Automotive Air- Conditioning Condensers. O. Conklu, Ford Mo- tor Co. This paper presents a simulation model to predict the thermal performance of automotive air-conditioning condensers. Operation of the air-conditioning system and the function of the condenser are discussed briefly. Details of the formulation to calculate various performance characteristics are given. Potential applications of the corresponding computer program are described. Com- parison of the computer results to test data shows that the model predicts heat rejections within 3-7% and air discharge temperatures within 0.5 F of the laboratory test data. 720077. Computer Simulation of Automotive Air Condi- tioning Components, System, and Vehicle. Gerald L. Davis, Frank Chianese, Jr. and Timothy C. Scott, Chrysler Corp. The basic theory and the techniques upon which the Air Conditioning Analytical Simulation Package (A/CASP) computer program system was developed is outlined. Methods for simulating car air conditioning components, systems, and cool-down performance by computerized mathematical models are presented. Solution techniques for the models of the evaporator, condenser, compressor, and vehicle are outlined. The correlation of test data and analytical predictions is demonstrated. 720078. Performance Analysis and Model Experiments for Louvered Fin Evaporator Core Development. M. C. Smith, Michigan State University. Computer analysis and large-scale model experiments to determine the air side performance of louvered fin evaporator cores are discussed. Heat transfer and pressure drop are determined for several configurations and compared with calculated values. The experimental setup and digital computer program used for both experiments are described. Effects of condensation, fins per inch, fin thickness, and other core characteristics are determined. The computer model for heat transfer rate appears valid over a Reynolds number of at least 10. Two empirical parameters of the program, one on the liquid side and one on the air side, should be adjusted after comparison with highly accurate empirical data. Addi- tional work is needed to improve the accuracy of data from the large-scale models, although determination of relative performance of different cores appears to be a present capability. The present theoretical model does not have the capability for calculating the liquid side heat transfer coefficient, the effect of louver angle or louver fin center distribution, or the effect of water droplet formation on the airflow and pressure drop. 720079. ROVACS: A New Rotary-Vane Air-Cycle Air- Conditioning and Refrigeration System. Thomas C. Edwards, Florida Technology University; and Alan T. McDonald, Purdue University. The ROVACS unit is a rotary vane combination com- pressor-expander-circulator, which is the key element in a new air-cycle refrigeration system. Results of an analytical and experimental feasibility study of the system are reported here. The objective of the study was to develop and verify a mathematical model of the system, including heat- exchanger pressure loss and mechanical friction. A parametric study was made to determine the geometry for a unit capable of cooling a passenger car, and a conservatively designed prototype was built and tested. The prototype system produced a cooling capacity of 5400 Btu/hr and generally verified the accuracy of the mathematical model. The coefficient of performance of the prototype system is somewhat lower than that of a typical vapor- cycle system. However, the ROV AC system is much simpler and will most likely be cheaper to build. The system response time is very short (approximately 10 sec), so immediate passenger comfort could be provided in an automotive application. Although a passenger car application is used as an example in the paper, the mathematical model could be used for computer-aided design of any ROV AC system. 720080. Fuel System Time-Temperature Histories During Specified Car Use Patterns. H. I. Wilson, Texaco, Inc.</page><page sequence="14">720082-720087 Time-temperature histories of fuel system components were measured on 80 passenger cars in the summer of 1968 in Los Angeles for several 24 h use patterns simulating normal vehicle operation. These included both driving segments on several types of highways and engine-off soak periods. Ambient temperature, type of driving, and vehicle design features have the greatest influences on fuel system temperatures. These time- temperature histories are of interest for fuel system evaporative emissions study. Two applications of these data have been reported. 1972 SAE Transactions 720082. Improved Fuel Distribution - A New Role for Gasoline Additives. A. A. Zimmerman, L. E. Furlong and H. F. Shannon, Esso Research &amp; Engineering Co. Problems of fuel maldistribution have been accentuated in late-model cars which use lean carburetion to reduce emissions. This conditions has resulted in increased driveability problems such as hesitation and surge as well as producing losses in power and fuel economy. Fuel distribution can be improved by gasoline addi- tives which form a coating of low surface energy in the induction system. As a result of improved distribution, benefits were observed for many cars in driveability, fuel economy, and exhaust emissions. 1972 SAE Transactions 720083. Influence and Implications of European Emission Legislation on Gasoline Lead Levels. J. D. Savage, J. L. Addicott and I. A. Fraser, British Petroleum Co. Ltd. This paper outlines reasons for emission legislation in Europe, makes comparisons with the United States where appropriate, and describes the pace and extent of existing and proposed legislation. It draws attention to variations that exist within the European continent due to national influences. The effect of legislation on the plans of the automotive and petroleum industries is discussed, and the effect of low-lead and unleaded fuel on performance of both existing and projected engines is considered. An attempt is made to assess the effect of all influences on the North American and European automotive industries and to forecast the general trend in automotive and fuel related developments in Europe over the next 10 years. 720084. Saving Maintenance Dollars with Lead-Free Gasoline. D. S. Gray and A. G. Azhari, Amer- ican Oil Co. Motorists who use lead-free rather than leaded gasolines postpone the need to replace spark plugs, exhaust systems, and carburetors, and thus save a significant part of their maintenance dollar. These savings were documented in a four-year test with a fleet of automobiles operated in | city-suburban driving, and in a five-year survey of t representative sample of the motoring public. Savings on f gasoline-related maintenance over the lifetime of an ( average car were about $0.05/gal in the fleet tests and $0.04/gal in the survey. 720085. The Influence of Engine and Fuel Factors on After-Run. Jack D. Benson, Fuels &amp; Lubs. Dept., General Motors Corp. Engine after-run, sometimes referred to as "run-on" or "dieseling," has existed for many years, but seems to be occurring more frequently with late-model cars and low-octane gasolines. A vehicle study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence after-run. Engine operating variables, such as high idle speed, lean idle mixture, and retarded basic spark timing, all increased after-run frequency by increasing the throttle opening (intake charge density). Reduced Research- octane number of the gasoline also increased after-run frequency, but Motor-octane number and hydrocarbon composition did not have any effect. After-run exhaust contained about 125 times more aldehydes than engine idle exhaust, and it caused eye irritation and an obnoxious odor. Compression ignition, rather than surface ignition, is most likely the cause of after-run. Discussion: P. E. Bright, Shell International Petroleum Co. Ltd. 1972 SAE Transactions 720086. Computer Spots Charging System Problems. Jim May, Arkansas Best Freight System, Inc. Use of the Data Process in helping fleet maintenance supervisors do a better job of determining component durability, cost, and aid them in writing truck/trailer specifications has become a tool that has taken the guesswork out. Almost all fleets have some specification that makes them unique, and the information derived from Data Processing can justify an option purchase of a component that has a good, long, low cost life. Reading the electrical system data of a truck over an extended period will make some things glaringly apparent: poor diagnosis of system failures or poor repair, the need for better placement of electrical system components, and the need for complete electrical system design for longer life. Some on-the-spot evaluation of alternator failures on 206 trucks over a 4-month period should help point out what needs yet to be done to get a longer life alternator. 720087. Lighting System Performance and the Computer as a Maintenance Tool. Charles J. Owen, Whitaker Cable Corp., Wesley S. Trindal, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research &amp; Devel- opment Center; and Luther E. Smith, Burlington Industries. rhis paper consists of three parts. The first part discusses *ood and bad electrical wiring, its causes and effects, and he ways in which specific hindrances to good per- formance can be minimized or eliminated. Several examples are cited to pinpoint practices that create 89</page><page sequence="15">720088-720094 90 problems in the wiring system and to show how such problems can be avoided. The second part of this paper covers vehicular lighting systems: malfunction and causes of failure, and ways of protecting the lighting system. Also discussed are the efforts of the industry associations to provide quality and standardization. The final section of this paper tabulates the results of data which have been entered into a computer memory bank in regard to the cost of maintenance on the lighting system. 1972 SA E Transactions 720088. The Computer and the Cranking System. M. B. Kent, Saunders Leasing; Lloyd Gony ou, Ship- pers' Dispatch; and Monte R. Blodgett, Edgcomb Steel. This paper gives insight into comments and suggestions gleaned from computerized maintenance reports per- taining to the cranking system. Part I deals with the starting system: what makes it expensive to maintain and what can be done to reduce maintenance costs. Specific suggestions are listed. Inasmuch as 90% of the overall maintenance costs of the cranking system brought about by faulty batteries, it is important to analyze the nature and extent of battery troubles. This aspect of the cranking system is discussed in Part II, including tests made of 10 Ryder trucks to delineate problem-causing practices and design deficien- cies that contribute to high maintenance costs. Part II discusses the importance of battery cables and connections. Major items of cranking system expense are compared to show that possible savings can result from improved cables and connections. 720089. An Instrumentation System for Vehicle Stopping Distance Tests. T. M. Atkins and D. P. Renner, Kelsey-Hayes Co. An accurate, compact, and convenient instrumentation system for vehicle brake testing has been developed. The system comprises a counter assembly mounted inside the vehicle, a switch that closes at the onset of braking, and a specially modified "fifth wheel." Stopping distance and initial vehicle speed are displayed in numerical form on the face of the counter assembly. Data acquisition is accomplished almost entirely by digital techniques. Measurement accuracy is therefore enhanced (by eliminating the usual dependence on analog voltage scaling). Digital techniques also permit useful control (decision-making) functions to be included. One such function is the unique feature of automatically eliminating erroneous distance pick-up during vehicle "rock-back" at the end of a high deceleration stop. 720090. A Theoretical Prediction of Disc Brake Tem- peratures and a Comparison with Experimental Data. S. Morgan and R. W. Dennis, Girling Ltd. Disc brake temperatures are predicted by considering the heat flow in two dimensions, allowing for losses by convection and conduction. Heat transfer coefficients are presented from earlier laboratory experiments which studied the effects of air crossflow velocity, rotational speed, and caliper angle, and their interaction. The theoretical results are compared with experi- mental data from vehicle tests, the differences being a measure of the magnitude of the effects caused by dirt shields, wheels, and body. 720091. Functional Testing of Brake Combination Valves. John R. Williams and Marshall W. Struble, Delco Moraine Div., General Motors Corp. The high level of reliability required of safety-related automotive parts, such as brake control system com- ponents, demands thorough functional testing of the component. A highly automated test system now in use at a component manufacturing plant helps to provide this reliability by performing 12 separate tests on each brake combination valve produced. The air test and the 11 hydraulic tests are described, features of test system design and operation are discussed, and the test equip- ment used is listed. 720093. A Combined Experimental and Analytical Pro- cedure for Improving Automotive System Dy- namics. Albert L. Klosterman, Structural Dy- namics Research Corp. Powerful capabilities for use in the analysis of complex automotive systems have recently been developed. These capabilities bring the newly developed electronic testing equipment together with the powerful computational techniques to perform a total system dynamic design analysis. The analysis tool developed is called the building block approach, whereby complex system behavior is defined by analyzing and combining the dynamic behav- ior of simpler components and subassemblies. The dynamic behavior of each component is obtained from a separate analytical investigation or from a specific type of experimental test procedure. Component data are then combined mathematically to predict dynamic behavior of the full system under the prescribed loading conditions. With the system simulation completed, design changes in any or all components can be evaluated. The effect of changes in any component on the operation behavior, vibration, noise, and stress can be ascertained. This paper describes the basic dynamic design analysis techniques which are available, and the automated testing methods and computer programs necessary to make the approach practical and successful. To demonstrate the application of this approach to automotive systems, the dynamic simulation of a heavy truck frame, cab, and cab mount system is described. 1972 SA E Transactions 720094. A Technique for Measuring "Effective" Road Profiles. Allan P. Whittemore, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp.</page><page sequence="16">720095-720100 A method of measuring the "effective" profile of road surfaces at highway speeds has been developed. This method is of particular interest to engineers involved in the study of vehicle ride and vibration phenomena on laboratory road simulators, because the measured road profiles include the effects of tire enveloping, thereby eliminating the need to simulate them. Furthermore, the road profiling instrumentation can be adapted to any vehicle which facilitates simulator to road correlation studies. 720095. Making a Road Simulator Simulate. Ronald A. Cripe, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. This paper defines a laboratory road simulator system and discusses various problems associated with using such a machine to test vehicles. Advantages and disadvantages of various methods for applying input forces to the vehicle are discussed to show why the author chose the method of exciting through the tire in the vertical direction only. The development of a method for solving the problem of simlating the rolling tire vertical properties is presented. Vertical and fore-aft response correlation resulting from this tire simulation is shown and the types of problems the author has chosen to study with this test system are explained. 720096. The Role of Information Processing Systems in Engineering. Edgar H. Sibley and Hasan Sayani, University of Michigan. The engineer has been a pioneer in the use of information systems: the referencing of information in handbooks; the communication of information via blueprints; the spec- ification of information for manufacturing, etc. The effect of the computerized information processing system is examined in the light of the expanding use of computers in the engineering environment, both technical and mana- gerial. Because these systems are designed for engineers, who will use them for technical problem solving or data management control functions, the engineer must be aware of the characteristics and limitations of these systems. This paper, therefore, deals with the catego- rization of systems, methods of specification, tools for implementation, and their use. It looks at the historical development of information processing systems, and the factors that drive their implementation; finally, it attempts to postulate the future trends of large-scale systems. 720097. Total Specifications Information System. Milton R. Freivogel, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Chevrolet is now using a new procedure for disseminating specification-type information. The new Total Specifi- cation Information System (TSIS) is an on-line terminal system featuring immediate response and a common data base. Specifications functions and accomplishments be- fore and with TSIS are described, with a history of its development: functions of a Specifications Dept., pro- cedure before TSIS, history of TSIS, information man- agement system, procedures and concepts of TSIS, educational requirements, statistics, and appraisal of the system. 720098. The Release and Control of Engineering Speci- fications. D. M. Mullen, Ford Motor Co. The use of computers and integrated-systems concepts has made computerized auditing techniques necessary. This paper discusses one such auditing system and describes the Ford part numbering and usage condition coding systems which are fundamental to its design. As part designs are released for production by Engineering, these parts are accompanied by a definition of the conditions under which the design is to be used for production and the required quantity per unit. This information is needed in calculating tooling requirements, scheduling manufacture and procurement of parts, and controlling inventories. 720099. The Determination of Vehicle Drag Contributions from Coast-Down Tests. R. A. White and H. H. Korst, University of Illinois at Urbana-Cham- paign. The problem of aerodynamic and rolling resistance characteristics of cars and trucks is of considerable importance to vehicle engineers as the two major con- tributions to external drag. Many testing methods have been developed including wind tunnel testing of scale models, testing of full-size production cars, and coast- down testing. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and analyzed. 1972 SA E Transactions 720100. Nissan Full-Scale Wind Tunnel - Its Application to Passenger Car Design. Kenichi Ohtani, Michio Takei and Hikota Sakamoto, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). In the development of high-speed automotive vehicles, wind resistance and vehicle stability characteristics, particularly aerodynamic lift and side-force effects, must be better understood. For this purpose and other uses, the Nissan Motor Co. has constructed a new full-scale wind tunnel now in operation at its Oppama Proving Ground. The new wind tunnel has been used for experimental studies of the factors contributing to the aerodynamic characteristics of passenger car bodies, and the results are described herein. The authors have also clarified the relationship between aerodynamic characteristics and high-speed road performance. The effect of minor changes in car shape, with various attachments, has been inves- tigated. Finally, the principle of a rear spoiler is treated both theoretically and experimentally at some length. 91</page><page sequence="17">720101-720106 92 720101. Four Sensors for Measuring Fow Quantity in Short Irregular Ducts. Thomas P. Yasin, Engi- neering Staff, General Motors Corp. There are many flow problems in which the flow quantity in a short, irregular duct must be measured. A meas- urement technique which is fast, causes no pressure loss, and can tolerate poor flow quality is often needed. The flow through the radiator duct of a wind tunnel model is one example. Four sensors were tested for velocity response and sensitivity to duct geometry. A full-factorial experiment utilizing a modular simulation of a radiator duct was employed. Two sensors, a propeller anemometer and a long hot wire, seemed to be quite independent of velocity distribution and flow angularity. 720102. Effect of Air Swirl on Smoke and Gaseous Emissions from Direct-Injection Diesel Engines. I. M. Khan, C. H. T. Wang and B. E. Langridge, C.A.V. Ltd. (England). This paper describes and discusses the results obtained from tests of the effect of air swirl variations on smoke and gaseous emissions from direct-injection- type diesel engines. Within the limits of the swirl variations used, an increase in swirl reduced emissions of smoke and carbon monoxide but increased nitric oxide emissions. An increase in swirl also makes it possible to retard appre- ciably the injection timing for optimum engine efficiency and this more than compensates for the increase in nitric oxide emission due to the increase in swirl. It is also shown that the air swirl intervenes in the processes of smoke and gaseous pollutant formation by affecting the details of the fuel-air mixing processes. 1972 SAE Transactions 720103. A New Deutz Multifuel System. Gerhard Finsterwalder, Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG (West Germany). As manufacturers of air-cooled diesel engines, the com- pany of Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD) undertook the rather rapid development of a multifuel engine on the basis of a proven mass-produced, air-cooled unit. Being equal in output, this new engine had to run on all fuels and fuel mixture obtainable at gasoline stations without any modifications being necessary. Preferably, it had to be produced by means of the same manufacturing facilities as the series engine and features a maximum number of identical parts. The solution to the problem involves supplementing the series engine with a high- tension ignition system employing a special spark plug in the direct vicinity of the injection nozzle. This spark plug can be subsequently installed following the rework of standard parts. By using the same basic setting of injection and ignition for all fuels, it is possible to attain absolutely knock-free combustion, with a gentle compression curve and a minimum of cyclic pressure variations. 720104. Cooperative Evaluation of Techniques for Meas- uring Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide. J. M. Perez, Caterpillar Tractor Co., L. C. Broering, Cummins Engine Co.; and J. H. Johnson, Michigan Technological University. A Coordinating Research Council cooperative program was conducted to evaluate the measurement methods used to analyze nitric oxide and carbon monoxide in diesel exhaust. Initially, a single-cylinder test engine was circulated among participants with poor results. Tests were then conducted at one site using a multicylinder diesel engine. Six organizations participated in the program. Exhaust analyses were conducted at steady-state engine conditions and on a 3 min cycle test. Span gases of unknown concentration were also analyzed. The partic- ipants results varied but averaged less than ± 5% standard deviation both within (repeatability) and among (repro- ducibility) the instruments. The short cycle test was in good agreement with the steady-state measurements. No significant difference in the use of Drierite, nonindicating Drierite, or Aquasorb desiccants was evident in sampling system tests. The instrumentation and methods used in this study were satisfactory for conducting emission measurements of diesel exhaust. 720105. Evolution of an Air Suspension for Trucks. W. S. Locke, International Harvester Co. A new truck air suspension system has been developed which provides excellent roll stability and articulation capability without compromising the exceptionally soft ride characteristics of air suspension. The concurrent realization of roll stability and articulation capability for tandem driving axles has been achieved by designing a semirigid, roll-resisting, rear rear axle, to be used in conjunction with a freely articulating, forward rear axle. This principle applies equally well for single driving axle vehicles, where the rigid axle provides the same role stability and articulation, not really a problem on single axle vehicles, is provided by frame and front axle suspension flexibility. The new suspension was designed to fit vehicle models ranging 23,000-54,000 gvw, to attach the rear axle housing to the trailing arm. Aluminum forgings were used in an effort to achieve minimum weight in every suspension part and all chassis components. 720106. GMC Astro Aire Rear Suspension. Robert F. Schmidt, Truck &amp; Coach Div., General Motors Corp. The purpose of this paper is to describe the recent development by GMC of an over- the-high way 34,0001b tandem rear axle air suspension system for heavy-duty truck/tractor applications. Various design approaches for truck air suspensions during the past two decades are touched upon to trace the evolution process leading to the present design philosophy which provides role resistance comparable to steel leaf spring suspension systems.</page><page sequence="18">720107-720112 720107. Development of Drive Axle Air Suspension for Highway Tractors. O. Lee Henry, Lear Siegler, Inc. Trailer air suspensions have been commonly applied to heavy-duty over-the-highway trailers. Recently, several concepts of drive axle air suspensions have been devel- oped within the industry to various stages. This paper presents concept parameters, product development, and suspension development of the Neway Drive Axle Air Suspension (ARD). Performance ride and handling factors, compatibility, and structural integrity were the established guidelines. 720108. Technological Trends in Power Semiconductors Significant for Electric Vehicle Controls. John C. Hey, General Electric Co. Over the past decade, significant areas of power semi- conductor development have been: Increased electrical performance characteristics and optimization of the mix of same to meet specific application requirements. Improved packaging for better heat management and lower system cost. Thoughtful rating and characterization of devices specifically tailored to the needs of the control equipment designer. These developments, as would be expected, have precipated the wide acceptance and usage of power semiconductors in diverse areas of power control. The resultant benefit has been an ever improving system performance at a decreasing system cost. 720109. Rapid Charging Batteries for Electric Propulsion Systems. R. H. Sparks, McCulloch Electronics Corp. Requirements and constraints for Rapid Charging bat- teries used for both pulse load and deep cycle service are outlined. Methods for fast recharging nickel-cadmium and lead acid batteries are described. A new rapid charge concept wherein nickel-cadmium batteries are both rapid charged and reconditioned is presented. Similarly, a unique method of fast charging lead acid batteries is described and illustrated. Areas of required technology improvements in batteries and electronic control devices for Rapid Charge application are outlined. 1972 SA E Transactions 720110. The Design and Development of a Third-Gen- eration Electric Highway Vehicle. Wayne E. Goldman, Anderson Power Products Inc. In September 1971, Anderson Power Products decided to design an electric highway vehicle scheduled for produc- tion by July 1972. The production design was based on two previous prototype vehicles. All the vehicles were original designs based on the unique requirements of battery-powered systems. This paper discusses a systems concept for electric vehicles, the design and evolution of a third-generation vehicle, and the support equipment necessary for successful vehicle operation and mainte- nance. 720111. Electric Car Drives - Design Consideration. Baruch Berman and George H. Gelb, Systems Group, TRW, Inc. Proper selection of the traction drive system to meet the requirements of an electric passenger vehicle is of prime importance. Choice may be made among alternating current, direct current, or combined systems. Each approach can be implemented by utilizing various control techniques and power elements. For instance, an a-c system may use an adjustable voltage inverter (AVI) or a pulse-width-modulated inverter (PWMI) for the power processor; and an induction motor or a synchronous motor for the rotating element. Similar alternatives exist for a d-c system. The choice of a suitable manner of implementation must be based on information characterizing the various elements and tradeoffs match- ing them to the vehicle requirements. This paper describes various a-c and d-c techniques, characterizes AVI, PWM and representative d-c chopper power processors and examines their interface with a variety of motors such as series, shunt, induction, etc. A review of characteristics relating to electric car require- ments is made in an attempt to orient the designer and user with information necessary for selection of drives. 720112. Time-Resolved Measurements of Hydrocarbon Mass Flowrate in the Exhaust of a Spark-Ignition Engine. Rodney J. Tabaczynski, John B. Heywood and James C. Keck, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Experimental measurements of the instantaneous exhaust gas temperature, mass flowrate, and hydrocarbon con- centration have been made in the exhaust of a single cylinder research engine. The temperature measurements were accomplished using an infrared optical technique and observing the radiation of the exhaust gas at the 4.4/mi band of C02. Instantaneous exhaust gas mass flowrates were monitored by placing a restriction in the exhaust manifold and measuring the instantaneous pres- sures across the restriction. Time-resolved hydrocarbon concentrations were measured using a fast-acting sam- pling valve with an open time of 2 ms. From these measurements, the hydrocarbon mass flowrate is calcu- lated as a function of crank angle. The hydrocarbon mass flowrate calculations show that approximately 40% of the hydrocarbons leave the cylinder early in the exhaust process, due to the exit of the head quench layer, and 50% leave the cylinder near the end of the exhaust process, due to the exit of a hydrocarbon-rich vortex produced by the upward motion of the piston. The remainder of the hydrocarbons leave in the middle of the exhaust stroke. The measurements explain why a reduction of the quench volume, created by the clearance between the piston and the first compression ring, reduces average hydrocarbon concentrations. 1972 SA E Transactions 93</page><page sequence="19">720113-720117 94 720113. Emissions from a Direct-Cylinder Water-Injected Spark Ignition Engine. S. S. Lestz and W. E. Meyer, The Pennsylvania State University; and C. M. Colony, Herbert R. Imbt, Inc. The gas-phase exhaust emissions which resulted when a variably timed, variable mass of water was injected directly into the cylinder of a spark-ignition engine are reported. The experimental setup and the procedure used in the investigation are also described. Conclusions are drawn with regard to the optimum injection timing and amount of water introduced. Generally, direct-cylinder injection of water reduces NO, increases unburned HC, and does not effect CO and C02. For a fixed-ignition timing, power also deteriorates. Another finding of this investigation is that direct-cylinder injection does result in NO reductions of better than 85% while using about one-third the mass of water required by manifold injection to effect a similar reduction. 1972 SA E Transactions 720114. New Aspects of Preignition in European Auto- motive Engines. J. C. Guibet, Institut Français du Pétrole; and A. Duval, ELF-Entreprise de Recherches et ďActivitiés Petrolieřes. Research has been done on preignition in automotive engines using a new experimental method enabling the phenomenon to be followed from its onset to its final phase. The technique consists of interrupting conventional spark ignition for a brief period and detecting any uncontrolled ignition signal at no matter what instant in the cycle it may occur. With regard to the danger of preignition, it was demonstrated that fuel effect depends on the following two properties: specific resistance to hot-point ignition and capacity to heat up a possible ignition source. The latter characteristic is linked to both combustion speed and fuel flame temperature. The source of preignition is usually the exhaust valve covered with mineral deposits coming from fuel and lubricant additives. The most harmful deposits are made of barium and calcium phosphates coming from detergent additives in lubricants; whereas lead compounds coming from antiknock additives in fuels have no appreciable effect. The effect of thermal parameters concerning engine design and operating conditions was also examined. In particular, it was demonstrated that preignition may appear no matter what the prior engine operating conditions may have been, provided that the engine is using large amounts of à harmful lubricant. Physiocochemical transformations were also examined inside exhaust valve deposits during preignition. A synthesis of the results obtained reveals the most effective ways of eliminating or reducing the danger of preignition in automotive engines. Such ways consist mainly of decreasing the harmful influence of various metallic lubricant additives on exhaust valve deposit properties. 1 972 SA E Transactions 720115. Measurement of Induction Gas Velocities in a Reciprocating Engine Cylinder. M. J. Arnold, M. J. Tindal and T. J. Williams, University of London. Instantaneous gas velocities inside the combustion cham- ber, cylinder and inlet port of a motored 4-stroke engine have been determined using a constant-temperature hot wire anemometer. The measurements were made with both stationary and moving probes, the latter being operated by means of a traversing mechanism driven from the piston of an adjoining cylinder. With the moving probes, it was possible to study the flow close to the piston crown throughout the induction stroke. The probes were calibrated in a steady gas stream and their response checked under transient conditions using a shock tube. Cylinder gas flow readings were obtained at two speeds of rotation of the engine and a masked inlet valve was used to create varying degrees of induction swirl. 1972 SAE Transactions 720116. New Tire Stud Developments. Rolf J. Cantz, Kennametal Inc. Although they offer snowbelt motorists substantial im- provement of vehicle control on icy roads, studded tires have been attacked with increasing vigor by highway officials for their contribution to road wear. Tests of some recently developed tire stud designs show promise that the safety and convenience factors of studded tires can be retained -but with a considerable reduction in the amount of road wear caused by their use. In addition to a reduction in weight and minor dimensional changes, most of these new tire studs are designed in such a way that the carbide pin will move further into the stud body if, at any time, the protrusion of the stud from the tire exceeds a critical limit. (The greater the protrusion, the greater the impact force. And it is high impact force which causes the road wear.) With their built-in protrusion-adjustment capability, the new tire studs maintain nearly uniform protrusion throughout their lifetime. Their ability to do so is unaffected by differences in wear resistance of various rubber compounds, driving speeds, or road surfaces travelled. Tires fitted with these new studs show an increase of 75% in coefficient of friction on smooth ice, as compared to identical tires without studs. Coefficient of friction decreases only about 5% with such studded tires on bare concrete (cement) roads. And no difference at all in performance between studded and unstudded tires has been found on bare bituminous pavement, dry or wet. 720117. Effects of Studded Tires on Pavements and Traffic Safety in Minnesota. C. K. Preus, Min- nesota Department of Highways. Increasing winter abrasion of pavement surfaces led the 1969 Minnesota Legislature to order the Minnesota Highway Department to conduct an in-depth study of studded tire effects relating to pavement wear and safety.</page><page sequence="20">720118-720122 In the laboratory, studded tires without sand and salt abraded pavement specimens 100 times faster than unstudded tires with sand and salt. Laboratory wear rates correlated with those found on highway pavements. If pavement wear should continue to increase at the same rate, premature repairs would become necessary at great cost. Accident studies indicated that on icy and snowy roads studded tires provide slight advantage over snow tires, but it was considered unlikely that discontinuance of studded tires would make an appreciable change in traffic safety in Minnesota. 720118. New Adhesive Needs and Concepts for the Aircraft and Aerospace Industries. Theodore J. Reinhart, Jr., U. S. Air Force Systems Com- mand. Adhesive bonded components have been utilized success- fully in both aerospace and ground vehicles and for many years. This paper examines several new applications for structural adhesives. Adhesives have proved to be cheaper, lighter, and better performing than their riveted or spot-welded counterparts. Many other advantages of adhesive bonding are cited. Several varieties of adhesive bonding materials in extensive use - including the recent introduction of corrosion resistant primers for use at 250-350 F - are discussed. Among the field problems of adhesive-bonded components are: inferior manufacturing techniques or processing procedures, improper surface preparation of metal adherends, inadequate production inspection pro- cedures, component underdesign, and extreme environ- mental exposure. Despite these problems, however, the use of adhesive bonding is expected to increase dramatically as adhesive technology develops further. 720119. Bonded Joints: Design Considerations and Army Applications. A. T. Devine, Picatinny Arsenal, Dept. of the Army. Ten points are offered as essential to good adhesives joint design. Examples of the role of adhesives in current Army hardware such as the LAW and Shillelagh antitank missiles and the Airmobile Aircraft Maintenance Shop are discussed. Training requirements are outlined for per- sonnel who are to bond munitions with adhesives, and examples of process controls for production line assembly are given. 720120. Adhesives for Naval Applications. Lawrence C. Ritter, Naval Air Development Center. This paper presents information on Navy research and development programs dealing with adhesives and adhe- sive bonding, with respect to their objectives, approach, findings, and future efforts. Three specific areas are singled out for discussion: stress corrosion failure of bonded aluminum; adhesives for use with difficutly bonded nonmetallic surfaces (polymers) and rocket propellants; and bonding and joining techniques for advanced filamentary graphite composites. Stress corrosion experimentation demonstrated the accumulation of corrosion products on the exposed aluminum. It is suggested that the diffusion of polyamine from epoxide adhesives contributes to the accelerated corrosion which leads to the formation of weak boundary layers. A proposed mechanism for stress corrosion cracking is presented. Forty standard adhesives of 26 types were investigated in the study of difficultly bonded surfaces and rocket propellant. The characterization of several of these adhesives is discussed with respect to shear strength, softening temperature, and failure under load. Epoxy /graphite composite, joined to itself and to other metallic members by adhesive bonding and bolting, was investigated to assess the material aspects with respect to the strength of the joint. Bonded joint strengths found limitation through the interlaminar shear strength of multiangled ply composite. Single lap bolted joints failed in the Carboform composite at the bolt hole at loads equivalent to 30% of the composite strength. Joints using double laps of titanium increased loading to 40% of the composite strength. It is noted that a lack of reliable data, against which bonded joints can be designed and ana- lyzed, presently limits full utilization of adhesive bonding in advanced structures. 720121. Valve Timing for Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx). Max A. Freeman and Roy C. Nicholson, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Three engine camshaft approaches to the reduction of oxides of nitrogen were investigated: increased valve overlap, variable camshaft timing, and variable valve overlap. The interaction of these systems with emissions, fuel consumption, and power was evaluated on a dyna- mometer engine. The effects of air-fuel ratio and exhaust backpressure were also reported. Results of the dyna- mometer study were verified with vehicle tests. Oxides of nitrogen levels of 1.2-2.0 g/mile were attained through camshaft design with acceptable driva- bility on the 1970 federal test procedure. 720122. Studies of Catalyst Degradation in Automotive Emission Control Systems. Joseph E. Hunter, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Reactions of sulfur, present in small amounts in gasoline, with catalyst and catalyst support materials are discussed. GMR studies have shown that sulfur accumulates in catalysts and support materials at temperatures of 600- 1300 F under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Partial sulfur release has been observed at 1200-1600 F. Concurrent with sulfur accumulation, there is a marked reduction in the carbon monoxide (CO) reactivity of noble metal, promoted and base metal catalysts. Lesser highly variable effects on hydrocarbon (HC) reactivity were noted. Studies of nitrogen oxide (NOJ reducing, 95</page><page sequence="21">720123-720127 96 noble metal catalysts also showed an adverse effect of sulfur accumulation on the NOx reactivity. These results indicate that steps must be taken to reduce or eliminate sulfur poisoning of automotive emission control systems. Approaches for achieving this objective are discussed. 720123. Exhaust Recirculation and Spark Control - A Speed Governed and Vacuum Modulated System. E. J. Martin and D. R. Vance, Perfect Circle Div., Dana Corp. Published test results have established that the recircu- lation of a portion of an engine's exhaust gas is an effective means of reducing oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust. Many methods of flow control have been tried; some require extensive revisions to the carburetion system. A retrofit system in which recirculation and spark advance are selectively controlled by vehicle speed and vacuum level has been tested on various cars to give 30-70% reductions in NOx as well as significant reductions in HC and CO. Revisions to the existing power train are minimal, while changes in driveability and fuel economy are hardly noticeable. 720124. Effect of Laboratory Ambient Conditions on Exhaust Emissions. M. J. Manos, Scott Research Labs., Inc.; J. W. Bozek and T. A. Hüls, Environmental Protection Agency. A program was conducted to determine the effect of temperature and humidity on exhaust emissions from automotive engines. The objective was to determine if the effects were of sufficient magnitude to require the application of correction factors to measured exhaust emissions to standard humidity and temperature values. Both American and foreign-made vehicles were tested at 20 combinations of ambient temperature and humidity. The effect of temperature and humidity was found to be both unpredictable and of little significance for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. No cor- rection factors were developed for these exhaust gas constituents. The effect of temperature was found to be of little significance for oxides of nitrogen. However, humidity effects were found to be significant and predictable for oxides of nitrogen. A correction factor was developed to correct oxides of nitrogen to a standard humidity value and was subsequently incorporated into the federal test procedure for determining automotive exhaust emissions. 720125. Evaluation of Gaseous Fuels for Automobiles. Stanley L. Genslak, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. An evaluation of gaseous fuels was made to determine their capability in reducing emissions from automobiles. The four-part program included tests of propane (LPG) and natural gas in a dynamometer engine (phase one) and in a car parameter study (phase two). Comparisons of power and spark requirements to gasoline were made on the dynamometer engine. Emissions, economy, perform- ance, and driveability were evaluated on the cars; and air-fuel ratio, spark advance, and exhaust gas recirculation served as variable parameters. The third phase of the program determined the low-emission capability of an LPG car with proposed emission hardware. The economy, performance, and driveability at these low levels were obtained. The final phase tested a dual-fuel car to evaluate the feasibility of using LPG to start and warm up the car, followed by an automatic switch to gasoline. The emissions, the driveability, and the LPG fuel consumption were recorded. 1972 SA E Transactions 720126. Carbon Dioxide Tracer Technique for Modal Mass Exhaust Emission Measurement. Ward W. Wiers and Charles E. Scheffler, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. The C02 tracer technique is a method of measuring automotive exhaust mass emissions during arbitrary modes of operation of a car on the 1972 federal emission test driving schedule. This technique allows modal mass measurements of low-emission cars based on undiluted exhaust gas concentrations. The C02 concentration at the tailpipe is compared with the C02 in the diluted stream to obtain exhaust flow. This flow, multiplied by tailpipe concentrations of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide, and integrated over the driving mode, gives modal mass emissions. Problems associated with the lag between the time at which a transient maneuver takes place in the engine and the time at which measurements are recorded are also discussed. 1972 SA E Transactions llalli. The Clean Air Act - Where Are We? Where Are We Going? How Are We Going to Get There? Eric O. Stork, Evironmental Protection Agency. This paper describes the implementation of Title 2 of the Clean Air Act, with special emphasis on the emission standards and test procedures which will apply to 1975 and 1976 light-duty vehicles. Discussed are the new test procedures to measure an average car's emissions, and the EPA's tests and analysis - particularly the baseline study of emissions from 1971 cars - which became the basis for setting the new standards. The complex control systems being designed to meet the 1975 standards are expected to require more main- tenance attention than the control systems currently in use. The EPA expects to allow more maintenance on durability vehicles than is allowed by the currently- applicable regulations, but will condition its approval of more maintenance on its reasonableness; reasonableness is discussed. Assembly-line testing will be based on average of emissions from produced cars, as well as to assure that cars with excessively high emissions will not be permitted to be sold; as soon as procedures are established</page><page sequence="22">720128-720135 for testing emissions from in-use vehicles, manufacturers will be required to repair at their expense any vehicle that fails such tests, or to recall and repair any class of vehicles that does not conform to applicable standards. Other related innovations brought about by the Clean Air Amendments are also discussed. 720128. Properties of Silicone and Organic Elastomers, as Measured at High Temperatures. A. L. Machek and J. T. Mclntyre, Dow Corning Corp. The high-temperature properties of silicone rubber are compared to those of six organic rubbers. New data on properties at temperature, as distinct from standard heat aging data, are presented to guide the designer and materials engineer. The properties of fluorosilicone rubber are also discussed. Current automotive applications of both silicone rubber and fluorosilicone rubber are de- scribed. 1972 SAE Transactions 720129. On the Rise: Engine Temperatures and Silicone Rubber Properties. T. J. Gair and W. W. Wads worth, General Electric Co. This paper shows that the rise in engine temperatures of automobiles has created a need for elastomers which can resist the deleterious effects of the higher heat. In addition to the high temperature requirement, a material with high tear and high modulus was also needed, as it is anticipated that there will be an increased use of silicone rubber fabricated parts. It is also pointed out that silicones have continued to improve their physical properties so that they are now being used in many automotive applications, and will be the answer to many design problems confronting the industry today. It is further predicted that there will be a need of silicone rubber adhesive/sealants to replace preformed gaskets and as bonding agents for trim and automotive ornaments. 720130. Molded Urethane Foam for Automotive Seating. L. M. Zwoliński, Allied Chemical Corp. Comfort, styling, and durability of automotive seating is largely due to the excellent performance of flexible urethane foam cushioning elements. This paper reviews the production and properties of current molded urethane foam cushioning, and the total assembly seating per- formance requirements. The newer developments of "full-depth" cushioning and "high-resilience" foams are examined in some detail. 720131. An Automatic Method for Identification of Dy- namic Properties of Rubber. R. E. Goodson and B. M. Hillberry, Purdue University; and A. S. Paul, General Motors Proving Grounds. A new method for determining the spring and damping constants for elastomer materials is presented. The method relies on three concepts - measurement of force and displacement or velocity across the test specimen, precise control of differential phase shift and sensitivity in transducers and electronics over the full operating frequency and amplitude range, and automatic optimal identification of K and C using analog hardware. The technique may be used in conjunction with either a resonant beam or electrohydraulic system, as demon- strated in the paper. Typical error sources are presented for both systems with indications given of their elimi- nation by the new technique. Hardware implementing the concepts is described and calibration test results given. It is concluded that the system provides an automatic test procedure which has the potential to reduce errors and maintain consistent results for rubber properties, relatively independent of the test machines and operators. 1972 SAE Transactions 720132. Impact Testing of High Density Semirigid Ure- thane Foam for Automotive Bumper Applications. Frank J. Limbert and William J. Persin, Mobay Chemical Co. Semirigid urethane-foam specimens of various high densities were evaluated when subjected to simulated heavy-mass impacts such as in low-speed automobile collisions. The dynamic test results showed excellent material-energy absorption with essentially no compres- sion sets, even after many repeated impacts of high deflection. These findings, coupled together with the well-known tough physical properties of urethanes, pro- vide an outstanding candidate material that can be used to effectively reduce the damage to support structures and contact surfaces, not only in automotive applications but in any other application requiring a reduction of shock forces. 1972 SAE Transactions 720133. Evaluation of Automotive Sponge Compounds with the Cone-Rheometer. W. W. Paris, Monsanto Co. A new curemeter, called Cone-Rheometer, has been developed. This instrument simultaneously determines changes in pressure and stiffness in elastomeric com- pounds during the course of vulcanization. The use of the Cone-Rheometer to evaluate extruded, continuously vulcanized, neoprene and EPDM sponge stocks is de- scribed. The effects of changes in blowing agent level, blowing agent type, and test temperature are observed and discussed. 1972 SAE Transactions 720135. Reduction of Noise Emissions from Diesel Engine Surfaces. M. F. Russell, C.A.V. Ltd. One of the effects of the existing and proposed European legislation limiting vehicle noise has been to generate a requirement for quieter engines. A simple analysis of the vibration of the external surfaces of several in-line engine structures has shown how the noise from the engine surfaces can be reduced, provided that all the thin-section areas of the external surface are treated. Noise-reduction techniques have been evolved for all 97</page><page sequence="23">720136-720143 98 the commonly used surface structures for diesel engines, and these are described in this paper. Four in-line diesel engines have been treated by these techniques, and noise reductions of 5-8 dBA have been obtained. In all cases, the same manufacturing plant was used to machine the modified crankcase/cylinder block casting; the valve gear cover and sump were modified versions of those already fitted to the engine. 720136. Vehicle Countermeasures for Intoxicated Drivers. Trevor O. Jones, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper is an expansion of a previously presented paper "Ignition Interlocks for Intoxicated Drivers" with addi- tional data analysis which exposed the basic problems resulting from the operation of automobiles by intoxicated drivers in the United States. Several approaches to the development of ignition interlock systems are discussed. The Phystester, an ignition interlock developed by General Motors and based on a pre-driving performance test of short duration, is discussed. Plans for evaluation of its effectiveness are presented, and available data from experiments involving both sober and intoxicated subjects are included. Integration of the Phystester in the operation of the vehicle and additional functional uses of the device are also discussed. Results of the Michigan Breath Testing Program 1970-1971 are provided as an Appendix. 1972 SAE Transactions 720138. Automatic Detection of Intoxicated Drivers. E. Donald Sussman, Philip W. Davis and Andrew Warner, U.S. Department of Transportation. As the evidence of the contribution of intoxicated drivers to vehicular fatalities continues to mount, interest has grown in the development of novel countermeasures. One approach now being considered involves the use of a device installed in the automobile which automatically determines if the driver is intoxicated and prevents the driver from operating the vehicle when intoxication is determined. In this paper such devices are discussed with particular consideration given to the method of deter- mining intoxication, the point in time when the deter- mination is made, and their applications. The paper also discusses the Transportation Systems Center's research program directed to dealing with this problem. 720139. Physiological and Response Measurements in Driving Tasks. David H. Weir and R. Wade Allen, Systems Technology, Inc. Driver response and performance can be quantified by observing the stimulus-response environment. Yet the driver's inherent adaptability allows him to have seem- ingly adequate performance in potentially hazardous driving situations even though he may be operating near the acceptable safety limits. Physiological measures of the driver's internal state can provide further quantification of his performance level and can give a measure of his workload or safety performance margin. Measures of driver physiological and control response have been made under gust disturbance conditions with the subject's car operating at various speeds. The exper- imental techniques and data are described, and corre- lations between the situational parameters and driver stress and control response are shown. 720140. Nonencumbering Visual Performance Measure- ments. Philip W. Davis, U.S. Department of Transportation; Jonathan S. Lutz, U.S. De- partment of Transportion; and Andrew Warner, U.S. Department of Transportation. Instrumentation has been developed to track and record dynamically an automobile driver's voluntary and invol- untary eye motions with no encumbrance to the driver's head or eye. This portable eye-tracking system makes possible field studies of the driver's: 1. Angle of gaze referenced to the scene. 2. Involuntary eye motions as possible indications of physiological state (fatigue, intoxication, etc.). 3. Pupil response. 720141. Heart Rate Variability: A New Index of Driver Alertness/Fatigue. James F. O'Hanlon, Human Factors Research, Inc. This was an investigation of the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and driver performance, and a preliminary test of an Experimental Alertness Indicator (EAI) - a device for measuring HRV. Three drivers drove on a round-the-clock basis for 5 days over a 364 mile (586 km) circuit on a California highway. HRV and driver error frequency were recorded and analyzed to determine effects of driving time, rest breaks, traffic event frequency, and other variables. The results showed that HRV increased markedly with driving time, HRV recovered after rest, HRV might have reflected features of the highway's geometric . configuration, HRV dropped sub- stantially after the occurrence of events which realer ted the drivers, and HRV was little influenced by traffic event frequency per se. It was concluded that HRV is related to driver alertness/fatigue and that the EAI has promise of being useful for estimating the level of driver alertness. 720142. Driver's Visual Range Detection. R. S. Frenk, Delco Electonics Div., General Motors Corp., D. E. Skaar, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp.; and J. A. Tennant, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper presents the results of a study to determine the factors required to monitor visual range. Equations are presented that indicate that it is possible to monitor visual range by using measurements of scene luminance, atmos- pheric backscatter, and ambient light levels. The concept of a device that could monitor a driver's visual range using these measurements is also described. 720143. The Effect of Stress on Driver Information Seeking. George L. Smith, Jr., The Ohio State University.</page><page sequence="24">720144-720151 This paper reviews research done by the Systems Research Group at The Ohio State University on the information- seeking behavior of automobile drivers. The effect of sleep deprivation, long term driving, and low levels of alcohol intoxication on driver eye-movement patterns is discussed. The adaptive behavior which results from loss of peripheral information processing capability under stress is manifested through wider dispersion and less preview by the tired drivers and tunnel vision by the intoxicated drivers. The loss of this information can be expected to result in unsafe performance. 720144. Driver Training for Emergency Situations. Al- bert Zavala, Robert C. Sugarman and Roy S. Rice, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. This paper discusses the value and the need for the simulation of relevant driver information processing and control functions. The emphasis is on relevance of simulation to ensure that such a simulation would have the practical utility of helping to reduce some accidents. An overall review is given of accident rate study findings, results of manual control studies, and conclu- sions based on psychomotor performance skills research. From this review, it can be pointed out that most people who drive a car, even as they are learning to drive, already know how to operate each of the various controls and switches and pedals found in a car. However, the sequence in which these should be operated, and the conditions under which they are operated are the critical factors to be learned and overlearned. It could also be pointed out from this review that the psychomotor skills of most drivers are adequate under routine conditions, but that these skills deteriorate under the stresses of speed, accuracy, task load, and information load. Such stresses can occur simultaneously under emergency conditions. Therefore, the overlearning of emergency driving skills is an impor- tant potential use for driving simulators. Thus, the paper shows that the simulation of driver information processing and control must be aimed toward the training of specific population groups in specific control tasks and under emergency-type driving condi- tions, as well as under routine-type driving conditions. It is assumed that high-accident rate driving populations who receive such simulation training would be more adequately prepared to handle routine and emergency driving situations and would, thereby, reduce the like- lihood of their being involved in a collision. 720147. The Tulsa Powerline 25 Winch System. Reed H. Kennard, Vickers Tulsa Div., Sperry Rand Corp. A new winch system has been developed and tested for installation of underground, or overhead, power or communication lines. The system utilizes a hydraulically powered traction winch with emphasis on ease of rope threading on a pair of urethane-coated grooved pulling drums. Engagement force for traction is provided by a separate hydraulically powered storage winch with a hydraulic powered levelwind. The load, speed, and footage are monitored continually. Control, reliability, and ease of maintenance have been the prime objectives throughout this project. Separate components add to the flexibility of the system and permit tailoring of each application. 720148. High Capacity Levelwind Winch. E. W. Turnquist, Braden Industries, Inc. A new two-speed winch of the traction-drum, storage- drum type for underground or overhead cable installation. Hydraulically driven with efficient planetary and spur- gear reductions, it is capable of levelwinding great lengths of wire or nonconducting rope under heavy-load condi- tion. With uniform input torque and speed, it will exert a constant cable pull and speed throughout any length of pull. It will free-spool for rapid rope removal. It is equipped with an indicating load gage, is fully adjustable for maximum cable pull and of a size compact enough to fit within a utility truck body. 1972 SA E Transactions 720149. Horsepower Requirements of Utility Truck Hy- draulic Systems. Donald H. Groft, Stelco, Inc. The hydraulic power systems used on many public utility vehicles are getting larger and more complicated as the manufacturers of these systems strive for additional performance and economy. More and more labor-saving devices are being introduced. Each new device further complicates the system. A tremendous amount of simpli- fication is necessary before these developments can be efficiently utilized. This paper reviews the power re- quirements and operation of the hydraulics system currently being used on the public utility truck. 1972 SA E Transactions 720150. Some Factors Affecting the Cold Pumpability of Crankcase Oils. R. M. Stewart and C. R. Spohn, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co. The cold pumpability characteristics of a group of commercial premium crankcase oils were evaluated at 0 and -20 F in a test stand engine. A test procedure was developed for these evaluations which gave results that compared favorably with those obtained in two popular makes of test cars at 0 F. In a second, more detailed, phase of this study, the effects of fourteen factors on the cold pumpability of several crankcase oils were investigated. The data from both phases were then analyzed to determine if an oil's cold pumpability in an engine could be predicted from its CCS viscosity, Brookfield viscosity, GM pour time, or ASTM pour point.

Twen- ty-one test lubricants encompassing a wide range of physical properties were employed in the investigation. Based upon this study, the flow characteristics of satisfactory sub-zero gear lubricants have been identified. Correlations of the truck axle flow results with several commonly specified tests for fluidity were attempted and discussed. The development of a small axle flow simulator is described, and its correlations with full-scale axle flow results is discussed. Discussion: R. B.

Powell and H. Ruwe Barton, Auto- Research Labs., Inc. The presently used laboratory hypoid gear scoring tests are described and the deficiencies are noted. The inade- quacies of these tests led to the development of a test device and a procedure designed to evaluate gear lubricants more accurately. An account of the devel- opment of the test system with the cooperation of the Coordinating Research Council, Inc. (CRC) is given. The unique design features of the gearbox and the test gears are described. An account is given of the steps in the test devel- opment and the use of the CRC reference oils in this development. The test is capable of evaluating the scoring resistance of hypoid gear oils covering a range of performance levels from RGO 104 to RGO 110. Data on repeatability are presented. Discussion: R. A.

Ltd. A testing technique has been evolved using typical United States and European production multicylinder gasoline engines to assess the effect of quantity and type of lubricant ash on surface ignition. Results indicate that, for a given metal type of additive, high-ash lubricants have a greater propensity to surface ignition than corresponding low-ash blends. Tests at a constant ash level show magnesium-based lubricants to be less prone to such problems than barium- or calcium-based lubricants. 720154. Unique 2 in.3 Displacement Engine for OEM. Cecil T. Cookson, O &amp; R Engines, Inc. A market existed in the 2-cycle engine field for an internal combustion engine in the 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 in3 range for the original equipment manufacturer. The engine had to be lightweight, compact, low in manufacturing costs, and yet offer high power output and continuous operation. For this market, O &amp; R Engines, Inc. designed the 2-CID Model 20 engine. The design filled a further requirement of the OEM by providing the flexibility of component design and arrangement. This paper discusses these design aspects. 720155. Sound Pressure Levels Generated by Internal Combustion Engine Exhaust Systems. G. P. Blair, The Queen's University of Belfast; and J. A. Spechko, Rupp Industries, Inc. A computer program has been developed which predicts the sound pressure level and the frequency spectrum produced by simple engine exhaust systems. The program utilizes unsteady flow gas dynamic theory to predict the pressure-time history in the exhaust system and the velocity-time history at the open end of the system. Acoustic theory is then used to predict the sound pressure levels and frequency spectrum in free space. The work was carried out on a twin-cylinder four- cycle engine, but the theory can be applied to any internal combustion engine. 1972 SA E Transactions 720156. A More Complete Analysis of Unsteady Gas Flow Through a High-Specific-Output Two-Cycle En- gine. G. P. Blair and W. L. Cahoon, The Queen's University of Belfast. The performance characteristics of a naturally aspirated two-cycle engine can be predicted with an unsteady gas dynamics analysis of flow through the crankcase and cylinder; such an analysis provides values of volumetric efficiency and trapping pressure at any given engine speed. The predictions of the volumetric efficiency and trapping pressure are compared with experimental values from a high-specific-output engine and further amplified with theoretical/experimental comparisons of pressure- time histories taken in the exhaust, transfer, and inlet systems at several engine speeds. The theoretical deri- vation of unsteady gas dynamic cylinder to pipe boundary conditions is presented so that they become both eco- nomical of computer time and mathematically stable.

Pamperin, Honeywell Inc. Maximum temperature is a critical parameter in the control of any thermodynamic cycle. Fast and precise temperature control means improved specific fuel con- sumption and increased engine life by making it possible to maintain the engine at or near its maximum temper- ature, yet not exceeding it. The fluidic temperature sensor is the first direct measuring sensor that offers both long life and fast response. It is applicable to mass production techniques and is ideally suited to vehicular and com- mercial gas turbine usage, as well as other types of heat engines.</page><page sequence="26">720159-720165 720159. Radiation Pyrometer for Gas Turbine Blades. David A. Rohy, T. E. Duffy and W. A. Compton, Solar Div., International Harvester Co. Advances in the development of radiation pyrometry for measuring the blade temperature in gas-turbine engines are reported. In this system, engine-mounted sensor heads collect thermal radiation from either a spot or a reason- ably large area of the turbine blade. High-temperature fiber optics transmit the radiation to a remote detector housing where the photons are converted into an electrical signal by a solicon photovoltaic cell. A signal processor measures and displays on a real-time basis three temper- ature characteristics of the turbine blades with response better than 10 ms in most cases. Recent developments include smaller electronics, practical sensor heads, and 5000 h fiber optics. Importance of measuring the blade temperature, potential uses of the data, and actual engine tests are described. 1972 SAE Transactions 720160. Development of a High Temperature Sensor for a Gas Turbine Engine. Robert F. Sullivan, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. A reliable high-temperature thermocouple for sensing turbine inlet temperature of a gas turbine engine has been developed. This sensor employs noble-metal thermo- elements but retains the high signal level associated with base-metal thermocouples. A unique system of secondary junctions, contained within the device itself, allows transition to relatively inexpensive standard thermocouple materials. The development of different sampling type protective probes, including an air-cooled design, accom- panied the development of the thermoelements. Some of the unsuccessful as well as the successful steps in the development are discussed, and some thoughts on future temperature sensors are given. 1972 SA E Transactions 720161. Material Properties Affecting Traction and Wear of Passenger Tires. R. N. Kienle and K. A. Grosch, Uniroyal, Germany; and C. E. Scott, Cities Service. The response of material to interfacial friction and abrasive slippage is discussed. Friction is divided into two factors: viscoelastic and adhesive. With slippage, the adhesive factor results ultimately in abrasion. Abrasion has been studied in the laboratory from a mechanistic approach and in the field from a base material approach. At least two mechanisms have been found: a tensile failure and a fatigue oxidative failure. Three major components of the tread (carbon black, oil, and polymer), have been found to have the largest influence on friction and wear. Some properties of carbon black and polymers that have been related to wear are reviewed. 720162. Towards the Unified Design of Tire and Pave- ment for the Reduction of Skidding Accidents. A. R. Williams, Dunlop Ltd., G. Lees, University of Birmingham; and T. Holmes, Dunlop Ltd. Pavement characteristics are dominant in the prevention of wet skidding accidents. The tire modifies the pavement properties together with the climatic conditions. Labo- ratory methods and site investigations have led to an understanding of the relative importance of pavement macro- and microtexture and to the isolation of the factors influencing wet road-hold of vehicles. Improvements in pavement characteristics are urgently required if wet skidding accidents are to be reduced; these changes will also influence future tire design. 1972 SAE Transactions 720163. The New Jaguar 12-Cylinder Engine. Walter T. F. Hassan, Jaguar Cars Ltd. A new Jaguar engine, incorporating 12 cyclinders in 60 deg Vee formation and using aluminum for most its construction, was announced in conjunction with a new "E"-type, series "3" sports car in March 1971. This paper is intended to describe this engine and to discuss some of the more interesting design features. The background history of the previous XK engine is pre- sented, together with the reasons for designing the new engine. The design features single camshafts per cylinder bank, with valves in line in a flat combustion chamber, together with a new Lucas transistorized ignition system.

This paper outlines the design features of the 4-cyl, overhead cam shaft 1.6-liter Dodge Colt engine together with four other single and double overhead cam shaft engines in the same family. These engines have been developed for high per- formance with a compact size and reduced weight. The Dodge Colt engine, in particular, has been designed to be in compliance with stringent 1972 United States emissions standards. Emission controls achieved with this engine, such as improved combustion chamber design of small sur- face/volume ratio and various control systems, are described in some detail. 720165. The Assignment of Responsibility for Air Pol- lution. L. S. Caretto, San Fernando Valley State College; and R. F. Sawyer, University of Cali- fornia, Berkeley. A simple method of weighting emissions data to provide a 101</page><page sequence="27">720166-720170 102 relation between source mass emissions and the resulting impact on air pollution is proposed. The importance of the following factors are considered: chemical severity of the pollutant species, source effectiveness, population expo- sure, and area severity. The selection of these factors is described with particular attention to the obtaining of chemical severity factors from air quality standards. Qualification upon the use of this weighting scheme are outlined. Application to the Los Angeles and San Francisco bay areas show that weighted emissions of transportation sources are less than their mass emissions, while weighted emissions of all other pollutant sources are greater than their mass emissions. In both cases, trans- portation remains the dominant pollution source category. 720166. A Method for Estimating and Graphically Com- paring the Amounts of Air Pollution Emissions Attributable to Automobiles, Buses, Commuter Trains, and Rail Transit. Jerold W. Scheel, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. An analytical method is described for estimating and graphically comparing the amounts of mass emissions from automobiles, buses, commuter trains, and rail transit given the emission characteristics of each type of vehicle. Emissions considered included carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen dioxide (N02), and sulfur dioxide (S02). These mass emissions are expressed in "grams per person mile" as well as "grams per vehicle mile" in order to consider their quantity based on the movement of people as well as on the movement of vehicles. The relative effects of these pollutants are also presented. Information from this method can be used to estimate the quantity of emissions produced in a specified area given the travel characteristics of that area. Changes in the amount of emissions resulting from persons who change their mode of travel can also be estimated. An example is used to demonstrate the method and application. Application of this method for a given region can help local officials estimate the effects of various transpor- tation policies on the regional transportation-related pollution. For example, estimated changes in travel habits that result from changes in the transportation system (rail transit, freeway, or busway construction), when combined with the information contained in this publication, can be helpful in estimating - in advance - the impact of various transportation policies as it relates to the amounts of emissions in a given region.

Dorgan, John M. Nolan and Russell L. Rio, General Electric Co. The effects of transmission selection on the performance and fuel economy of a gas turbine powered automobile are analyzed. Both single-shaft and two-shaft turbines are considered. Examples are given of fuel economy for an urban cycle, and performance of these engines with an infinitely variable transmission and with a power shift automatic transmission. The primary conclusions are that the infinitely variable transmission is necessary for a single-shaft engine and highly desirable for a two-shaft engine, and the use of an infinitely variable transmission with the single-shaft turbine eliminates any need for the wider output speed range of a two-shaft engine. 720170. The Development of Silicon Nitride to Achieve Higher Inlet Temperatures in Land Based Gas Turbines. R. J. Lumby, R. F. Coe and D. J. Lines, Joseph Lucas North America, Inc. The introduction of the gas turbine engine into auto- motive transport will depend, to some extent, on the achievement of an efficient working cycle. Implicit in this requirement is the operation of the turbine at inlet temperatures in excess of 1500 K where metallic alloys have insufficient strength and corrosion resistance. Of the ceramic materials being considered for this environment, silicon nitride is the most attractive because of its low coefficient of thermal expansion, good thermal shock resistance, and high strength at these temperatures. The techniques and processes used in the production of reaction-bonded and hot-pressed silicon nitride are sufficiently advanced to enable predictions of material costs to be made. Consistent material is now available with well- established physical properties and having potential for further development. Discussion: D. E. Stoddart, R. P. Graham and R. B.

McMaster, The Ohio State University. New methods of nondestructive testing applicable to automotive industries include xeroradiography, a high- speed, low-cost method of x-ray inspection without use of films or darkroom processing, for tires, plastic parts, welds, and castings; optical holographic nondestructive tests for detection of anomalies and lack of bond in tires; magnetic field tests which measure hardness (or case depth) in engine parts, steering knuckles, and door hinges or latches; x-ray television systems which permit direct, in-motion viewing of plastic, metallic, and tire assemblies; and advanced eddy current test systems with a variety of sorting, dimensional control, and defect-detection capa- bilities. These supplement presently available methods such as film radiography, magnetic particle, liquid- penetrant, ultrasonic, and visual inspection, and sampling destructive tests, in quality control for reliability in the automotive manufacturing industries. Further needs for nondestructive tests in the auto- motive industry include development and application of high-speed, low-cost, automated evaluation test systems which can be incorporated into production lines and operate unattended over long periods. There is need for nondestructive test systems adequate to ensure the manufacturer against liability arising from defective components, designed to provide automatic feedback control of production processes and to eliminate unserv- iceable components before these can be assembled into automobiles and trucks. 720172. Advanced Nondestructive Testing Methods for Bearing Inspection. John R. Barton and James Lankford, Jr., Southwest Research Institute; and P. L. Hampton, Air Force Logistics Command, Warner Robins AFB, Georgia. The principles of the magnetic-perturbation method of flaw detection and the Barkhausen noise residual stress measurement method are briefly reviewed. It is suggested that they provide very powerful tools for assuring improved ball bearing performance. The methods are applied for the evaluation of ball bearing races. Typical experimental results are presented along with metallur- gical sectioning correlation. 1972 SAE Transactions 720173. Acoustical Holography. Victor I. Neeley, Holo- sonics, Inc. Acoustical holography is a real-time nondestructive testing technique which produces a visual image of the internal structure of the part being examined. This technique uses ultrasound to visually detect the presence of any anomalous condition in the material under test. Since the visual image presented shows the position and orientation of all flaws, the integrity of the material is immediately determined. The detection of cracks, voids, nonbonds, and other anomalous conditions interior to metals, ceramics, and plastics can be carried out on a high- volume, production-line basis. Various applications to the automotive industry are discussed. 720174. Nuclear Techniques for Produce Inspection and Quality Assurance. Robert F. Hill, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The increasing emphasis on automotive safety and reliability through produce assurance has further stimu- lated the development of new and improved inspection methods. Nuclear techniques are finding ever-increasing application in this area, and have been used successfully in a variety of automotive inspection problems. Some of the unique methods which have been developed are presented to demonstrate the versatility of nuclear techniques when unusual inspection problems arise. Applications described include: measurement of oil consumption of production engines, monitoring compo- sition of continuously cast bearing material, detection of internal voids in plastic-foam parts, and measurement of the moisture content of foundry sand. 1972 SAE Transactions 720175. Acoustic Emission Related to Nondestructive Testing. C. A. Tatro, Lawrence Radiation Lab., University of California. Acoustic emission technology has developed to the state where broad applications to materials testing and evalu- ation are evident. The unique characteristics of acoustic emission as they bear on applicability to nondestructive testing are emphasized. Among the advantages anticipated for the acoustic emission method, two are especially noteworthy: 1. Moving inspection upstream in the production process so that bad production can be eliminated before large fabrication and assembly costs are accumulated. 2. Economical 100% NDT inspection of finished components or products. 720176. User Attitude Surveys and Transportation Sys- tem Development. Herbert J. Bauer, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper deals with a new concept of transportation system development based on well-established psycho- physical principles. It reviews briefly the traditional method of transportation system development and modi- fication. The point is made that it now becomes necessary to reverse the usual trend of declining public transpor- tation system usage. The "new philosophy" of system development utilizing user-oriented techniques in the form of attitude surveys is presented as a possible aid in enhancing public transit use. As an exemplar to illustrate four techniques (paired comparison, semantic scaling, branch-and- bounds inter- view, and document attitude analysis) the methods and some representative data of General Motors Research Laboratories' Transportation Research Department case 103</page><page sequence="29">720181-720189 104 study of a door-to-door (demand-actuated) public trans- portation system is discussed.

Steel Powders for the Powder Metallurgy (P/M) Forging Process. Joel Muzik, Hoeganaes Corp. The kind of powder selected for use in the P/M forging process depends on the requirements of the finished part. Most of the commercially available P/M powders can be used to make parts by P/M forging, and a majority of these applications do not require properties as high as those achieved by conventional forging. However, the most likely candidate for use in manufacturing parts that require the properties of conventional forgings is atomized low-alloy steel powder. When processed correctly, parts made from the atomized powders will duplicate the microstructure and hence the mechanical properties of conventional wrought steels. Initial interest in alloys centered around the nickel- molybdenum steels (AI SI 4600). However, because of economic factors there has been a shift to alloys leaner in nickel and to those that contain the less expensive elements such as manganese and chromium. The properties of a P/M forged part are not only dependent on the quality of the powder used but also on the processes by which it is forged. Care must be taken in each of the three major P/M forging steps - powder manufacturing, preform processing, and powder forging to insure that the part is not degraded by oxidation. Test results show that a low-alloy steel powder can be manufactured, processed using conventional P/M tech- niques, and hot forged to give properties that are equiv- alent to those of wrought material. 720182. High Speed Tool Steels by Particle Metallurgy. A. Kasak, G. Steven and T. A. Neumeyer, Colt Industries, Crucible, Inc. Application of the powder or particle metallurgical (P/M) method to the production of high-speed tool steels is an effective means of controlling segregation problems. Macro- and microsegregation are virtually eliminated. The characteristics of carbides in the microstructure are appreciable changed; this has important effects on the pertinent properties. The P/M high-speed steel products offer significant advantages in the manufacture and performance of tools. The advantages include superior grindability, machina- bility, size change uniformity, cross-sectional hardness uniformity, hardening response, and tool life under intermittent cutting conditions. The observed property and performance advantages are rationalized in terms of the rapid solidification rate inherent in powder making, as well as in terms of basic microstructural characteristics of the P/M products. 720183. Hot Isostatic Pressing with Vitreous Tools. C. J. Havel, Kelsey-Hayes Co. This paper discusses the use of powder metallurgy to produce gas turbine components. Various methods of manufacture are mentioned, with particular emphasis on hot isostatic pressing. Because rippling, buckling, and similar problems are associated with HIP, the use of glass or vitreous containers was attempted and found very satisfactory. The use of Astrology, Inco 718, IN- 100, and Rene 95 in this technique is described. The success of these alloys, the wide shape flexibility, and the wide operating temperature range prompt the authors to feel many materials can be produced by this process. 720187. The Development of Electric Transport Vehicles of Self-Supporting Plastic Sandwich Construc- tion. H. G. Raschblichler, Messerschmitt- Bölkow-Blohm GmbH (Germany). The development of an innovative electric transport vehicle of self-supporting plastic sandwich construction (FRP/PUR sandwich) is described. The specific advan- tages inherent in this plastics technology as applied to electric transport vehicles are illustrated. A short survey of the production technology as well as of the materials behavior is given. The propulsion and control concept in addition to the design of the source of energy are clarified. The test results obtained with the prototype, undergoing testing since one year, are given, and an automated data processing system for evaluating the test results described. The battery change technique is outlined and the important features discussed. Vehicle and operating costs of the innovative electric transport vehicle are indicated in brief. 720188. Sundancer: A Test Bed Electric Vehicle. Robert S. McKee, McKee Engineering Corp., Boris Borisoff, Tork-Link Corp.; Frank Lawn and James F. Norberg, ESB Inc. A test bed electric vehicle was developed to provide a most favorable operating environment for state-of-the-art lead-acid storage batteries. Performance data were acquired using portions of SAE J227, Electric Vehicle Test Procedure. Tests results illustrate the performance potentials for special purpose road vehicles designed around this power source. 720189. Daihatsu S-37 Mini Cabover Electric Truck and Its Electric Equipment. Isamu Takaoka, Ichiro Umo tor and Shiro Kawakatsu, Daihatsu Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Japan). A recently introduced Japanese electric light truck, the Daihatsu S-37, is described. Its dimensions are: length 9.84, width 4.25, and height 4.25 ft. The truck's maximum speed is 40 mph. The driving range per charge with a payload of 450 lb and two persons is 40-50 miles. The vehicle contains a series-wound traction motor of 10 hp</page><page sequence="30">720190-720196 peak power rating, an SCR chopper speed control unit, and six 12 V batteries of 150 AH capacity. In Japan many Daihatsu S-37 vehicles are in commercial use as delivery trucks for milk and other goods and have acquired a good reputation. 720190. Practical Operation of Electric Vehicles in In- dustry. Berkeley S. Hender The battery electric vehicle has had limited success except in the United Kingdom, where large fleets operate mainly for the dairy industry. Changing social conditions are now bringing modifications to these fleets where many vehicles are used as traveling shops dealing in a wide variety of domestic goods. The development is seen as the fore- runner of wider use of general-purpose vehicles, requiring improved performance and range. The operating costs and high reliability of the vehicles have been proved. Some typical costs are given, together with those for backup mechanical handling industrial trucks. Improvements in energy sources and other compo- nents are now becoming apparent. These, together with worldwide interest, predict a vast growth in the industry, particularly in commercial applications for battery electric trucks and vehicles. 720191. A Fuel-Cell/Lead-Acid-Battery Hybrid Car. M. R. Andrew, W. J. Gressler, J. K. Johnson, R. T. Short and K. R. Williams, Shell Research Ltd., England. A DAF 44 saloon car has been extensively modified to study some of the problems associated with building, controlling, and driving a car powered by a fuel-cell battery. A prototype hybrid car has been made, using as a power source two 12-cell hydrazine/air fuel batteries in conjunction with six conventional 6-cell lead-acid ac- cumulators. The car has been successfully demonstrated on several occasions, and its performance has been measured. The performance of the car, in its present form, falls between that of today's internal-combustion-engined vehicles and that of secondary-battery-powered ones. However, unlike more conventional electric cars, its ranges under town driving conditions and at its steady cruising speed are not limited by the quantity of stored electricity. Some general comments are made on possible future developments. 720192. Auxiliary Services for a Fuel-Cell Hybrid Electric Car. M. R. Andrew, W.J. Gressler, J. K. Johnson, R. T. Short and K. R. Williams, Shell Research Ltd., England. This paper describes the development of the pumps, blowers, and electronic control systems for a fuel- cell/lead-acid-battery hybrid electric car. Wherever pos- sible, commercially available equipment was used in order to reduce costs and expedite the completion of the vehicle. With the chosen components and their associated control circuits, a vehicle was completed which behaves much like conventional cars with two-pedal controls. It is concluded that if low-cost fuel cells were to become available the construction of auxiliaries to provide a satisfactory vehicle would not prove difficult. 720194. Evaluation of Powertrains for Hybrid Heat Engine/Electric Vehicles. H. T. Sampson and H. J. Killian, The Aerospace Corp. Hybrid powertrain configurations were evaluated for several classes of vehicles. This paper presents a discussion of the type of hybrid powertrain configurations evaluated, their respective mode(s) of operation, a discussion of computer simulation of powertrain/vehicle performance, and the effect of the performance of several key power- train components such as heat engine, battery, and electric drive motor on vehicle emissions. Based on power and torque requirements for various classes of vehicles as derived from basic specifications and performance guidelines, it was found that the necessary hybrid powertrain configurations would be composed of major components of a relatively feasible efficiency and size. It was also found that vehicle emissions are relatively sensitive to electric drive motor efficiency and relatively insensitive to battery recharge efficiency. Driving-cycle characteristics were shown to have a significant effect on theoretical average emission levels. Overall, the results suggest that the hybrid/electric powertrain appears to offer promise as a means of obtaining low-emission vehicles compatible with the 1975-1976 Federal Emissions Standards. 720195. A Study of Two-Stroke Cycle Petrol Injection Engines for Exhaust Gas Purification. Giichi Yamagishi, Tadanori Sato and Hiroyoshi Iwasa, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. A petrol direct-injection system was applied to a 2-stroke engine for the purpose of reducing exhaust gas emissions, especially exhaust hydrocarbons. It was observed that fuel injection only, as an alternative to the carburetor, was not an adequate means for exhaust gas purification. Therefore, a combined throttle and spark timing control device and a thermal reactor were also adopted. On an automotive injection engine with a swept volume of 21.7 in3, these changes succeeded in reducing hydrocar- bons to 5 ppm and carbon monoxide to 0.21% in the Japanese four-mode test. The durability of the thermal reactor is not yet adequate. 1972 SA E Transactions 720196. Developing a New Stratified-Charge Combustion System with Fuel Injection for Reducing Exhaust Emissions in Small Farm and Industrial Engines. Masataka Miyake, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. This paper describes a new stratified-charge combustion system called the Mitsubishi Combustion Process (MCP), 105</page><page sequence="31">720197-720201 106 accomplished by controlling the air swirl and improving the injection nozzle in regulating fuel injection, with reduces poisons from exhaust emissions of small engines. Experiments proved that the MCP engine reduces the emission level; for example, with gasoline the concen- trations of HC, CO, and NO are 80 ppm, 0.20%, and 600 ppm, respectively, at the rated hosepower. The engine shows excellent performance in multifuel and starting characteristics. The improvement of spray formation that has an important effect on exhaust emissions and other engine performance is also described. 1972 SAE Transactions 720197. Exhaust Emissions from Small, Utility, Internal Combustion Engines. B. H. Eccleston and R. W. Hurn, Bureau of Mines, U.S. Dept. of the Interior. This material reports findings of an exploratory exper- imental study designed to add information on the contribution to air pollution of exhaust emissions from small, utility engines, and to evaluate the procedures used to test small engines. Gross measurements of hydrocar- bon, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide are reported for 29 4-cycle and 7 2-cycle engines; sizes of the engines ranged 2-22 hp. Emissions measurements were made on each engine for nine combinations of load and air-fuel adjustments; only one speed point - full governed - was covered in the tests. Test procedures are described. An overall average of the data indicate that, operated at full-load and optimum air-fuel ratio, the four-cycle engines emitted about 8 g HC, 180 g CO, and 5 g N02 per horsepower-hour. Under comparable conditions, the 3-6 hp two-cycle engines emitted an average of 140 g HC, 240 g CO, and 2 g N02 per horsepower-hour. Discussion: J. H. Crowley, J. I.

Newhall, University of Wisconsin; K. S. Sanvordenker, Tecumseh Pro- ducts Co.; and N. C. Woelffer, Jacobsen Manu- facuring Co. This paper describes the work of the Small Engine Emissions Subcommittee of the SAE Engine Committee in determining the characteristics of emissions from small utility engines. The study concentrated on utility and off-highway vehicle engines (for example, lawn and garden equipment), not motorcycles. Results of the study indicate that emissions from garden type engines presently constitute less than 1% of the total from all United States sources. Although the data are less reliable on large two-cycle engines such as snowmobiles, there is an indication that such vehicles may contribute a dispropor- tionately large share of the total small engine hydro- carbons. A test procedure for the measurement of small engine exhaust emissions is included. Discussion: J. H. Crowley, J. I. Case Co. 1972 SAE Transactions 720199. SAE Controls Research Study. David C. Hammond, Ford Motor Co.; and Ronald W. Roe, Styling Staff, General Motors Corp. This report presents the results of the SAE Human Factor Committee Driver Control Research Study conducted in June- August 1971. Over 120 test subjects were measured at Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors on three test fixtures representing a sports car, a typical passenger car, and a heavy truck. Finger grasp reach was recorded to 40 locations in front of the driver for both a lap belt and a lap belt with a diagonal shoulder strap. The report presented the background information for a forthcoming SAE Recommended Practice on Driver Arm Reach. 1972 SAE Transactions 720200. Driver Head and Eye Positions. David C. Hammond, Ford Motor Co.; and Ronald W. Roe, Styling Staff, General Motors Corp. Results of previous SAE drivers' eye-location studies have been used to develop a fixed seat eyellipse and contours that describe drivers' head locations. Centroid data from these and other eye-location studies are used as a means of locating the SAE eyellipse according to seat back angle. Part I comprises the discussion of these data. Studies recently completed provide data on drivers' eye locations for varied vehicle packages ranging from sports cars to heavy trucks. The results are summarized in Part II as a series of tables, which include statistical definitions of tangent cutoff eyellipses. Part III of this report describes a method for positioning a fixed seat eyellipse according to seat back angle. A method is also shown for measuring headroom relative to seat back angle. 1972 SAE Transactions 720201. Comparison of Static and Dynamic Driver Eye Position in Various Passenger Vehicles. William J. Burger, Dunlap and Associates, Inc. Cyclopean eye positions of a small selected sample of drivers were measured relative to vehicle reference points while they performed usual driving activities in several late model vehicles. One vehicle was modified to obtain enhanced lateral and rear visibility. Results indicate that 1) during driving, eye position shifts substantially to the rear of static eye position, 2) shoulder belts restrict eye excursions even during straignt ahead driving, 3) a periscopic type mirror eliminates eye position shift and reduced variability during lane changes when compared to standard rear vision devices, 4) there is no consistent change in eye position over extended periods of driving, and 5) driving environment does not significantly affect average eye position.</page><page sequence="32">720202-720210 720202. Identification of Controls Background and Ap- proach. Peter Kyropoulos, Styling Staff, General Motors Corp. The history and technical background of the Control Identification Subcommittee of the SAE Human Factors Committee is reviewed. Recommendations are presented for a proposed SAE Information Report on Identification of Controls for Passenger Cars, with particular emphasis on guidelines for the development of new identifications. 1972 SAE Transactions 720203. Identification of Controls - A Study of Symbols. Daniel D. Jack, Ford Motor Co. The development of a procedure to evaluate the driver's ability to identify and attach meaning to automotive control identification symbols is outlined, together with the test results of Step I of a three-step procedure. The use of a standardized test methodology is essential in arriving at any standard set of symbols which are expected to have a high potential for immediate understanding by the driving population. 1972 SAE Transactions 720204. Human Factors Analysis of Current Automobile Control/Display Characteristics. Henry S. R. Kao, Thomas B. Malone and Richard L. Krumm, Essex Corp. This paper reports an analysis of the degrees of con- trol/display (C/D) standardization in location, operation, and coding characteristics for 1971 automobiles. For C/D location commonality, between-manufacturer and with- in-manufacturer and between-car-type designs are com- pared. For operation and coding analysis, a selected group of C/D was used. With 90% of domestic and 76% of imported cars surveyed, a great variability of C/D designs was found for all three measures. The second part of the study experimentally evaluated four alternate control concepts for passenger car three-beam headlight systems. 720208. Installation and Operation of Gas Turbine En- gines in Surface Effect Vehicles. D. Hürden, Bell Aerospace Co. There are in the world about 20 different surface effect vehicles powered by gas turbines, but the bulk of engine operating experience has come from three of them - the British Hovercraft Corp.'s SRN 4 and SRN 5, and the Bell SK 5. Engine problems in all three craft have stemmed from the ingestion of foreign objects, including ice, sand, and salt spray. This paper describes these problems and the steps that have been taken to solve them. 720209. Application of a Monel-Platinum Dual-Catalyst System to Automotive Emission Control. R. S. Lunt, L. S. Bernstein, J. G. Hansel and E. L. Holt, Esso Research &amp; Engineering Co. A dual-catalyst-equipped test vehicle, containing Monel catalysts for the reduction of oxides of nitrogen followed by platinum oxidation catalysts, has controlled emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitro- gen to levels of 8.0, 0.4, and 0.8 g/mile, respectively, using the single-bag 1972 federal test procedure. The Monel catalyst was fabricated in a low-mass, high-surface-area, open-mesh structure. The low mass contributed to rapid warmup of both the reduction and oxidation catalysts. The high geometric surface area permitted efficient conversion of all three pollutants simultaneously when the vehicle was operated only slightly richer than stoichi- ometric. As a result the amount of oxidation required of the platinum catalyst was greatly reduced. The durability of Monel is a major problem. The mechanism of Monel strength loss, currently the limiting factor in catalyst life, was shown to be grain-boundary widening due to alternate oxidation-reduction reactions undergone by the metal. Reinforcement of Monel by an oxidation-resistant metal, particularly when accompanied by fabrication into a unitary structure, significantly improves strength and maintenance of low pressure drop. However, durability equivalent to 50,000 miles of vehicles operation has not yet been demonstrated. A rapid method for Monel surface activation has been found to replace inconvenient vehicle activation. Heating in moist air for several hours develops the surface roughness necessary for high activity. Finally, laboratory tests of a technique for enhancing the warnup rate of the oxidation catalyst by means of an electrically heated "trigger" element are described. Expenditure of a rela- tively small amount of power through this catalytically active element can release sufficient heat of reaction to light-off the main oxidation catalyst. Discussion: R. J.

The Effect of Fuel and Vehicle Variables on Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbon and Phenol Emissions. George P. Gross, Esso Research and Engineering Co. Exhaust emissions of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA) and of phenols has been studied with a variety of test fuels, using cyclic tests in five vehicles including one without emission control (NC), two with engine-modi- fication (EM) control, and two with experimental very- low-emission systems. The experimental systems both reduced phenol emis- sion to less than 0.5%, and PNA emission to about 1%, of the levels observed in the NC vehicle. Phenols were reduced 30% by one EM vehicle, but not by the other EM vehicle, while PNA emissions were reduced by 70% in both EM vehicles. Fuel composition influenced emissions both directly and through engine deposits. Direct effects included increased phenol emission from increased fuel aromatics and, generally, increased PNA emission from increased fuel aromatics, from increased fuel PNA, and from the presence of a high-boiling naphtha. However, these direct 107</page><page sequence="33">720211-720215 108 effects of fuel composition on emissions generally de- creased, in both relative and absolute terms, in the emission-controlled vehicles. The PNA emissions from several test fuels differed by a factor of two between engine deposits formed from two different commercial premium gasolines. High PNA emissions occurred with deposits from a fuel containing lead and phosphorus; an unleaded fuel, of different hydrocarbon composition and without phosphorus, gave low-emission deposits, but this same fuel, with lead added at 0.5 g/gallon, still gave low emission. The exact fuel factors are not clear at this time. Discussion: M. E. Griffing, Ethyl Corp.; C. L. Oubre, Shell Oil Co.; and John B.

George Kim, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Development of engine-vehicle prototypes for low emis- sions and optimum fuel control characteristics has been facilitated through use of a computerized emissions test system. Simultaneous on-line sampling of exhaust species concentrations, fuel consumption, spark advance, pres- sures, and temperatures provides both graphical and computed outputs of several vehicle parameters that are important to development programs. On-line display of vehicle air-fuel ratio is continuously supplied. Either of two federal driving cycles (or any random driving schedule) may be employed. Dynamic calibration, range sensing, and zero-drift correction keep operator interaction and errors to a minimum. Capability for reprocessing, plotting, and/or patching stored data provides increased computational flexibility. 720212. A Mobile Instrumented Vehicle for Measuring Road Performance and Exhaust Emissions. W. I. Doty and L. J. Olejnik, Shell Oil Co. The paper describes Shell's mobile instrumented vehicle for measuring road performance and exhaust emissions. Information is given on the design critieria and construc- tion features of the vehicle and its instrumentation system. Test results show typical applications of the vehicle in providing data on the effect of engine adjustment and component condition on performance, fuel economy, and exhaust emissions. Instrumentation in the vehicle includes exhaust-gas analyzers to measure unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and carbon dioxide concentrations in the exhaust gases. The center of the system is a 40-channel magnetic tape data logger which can accu- mulate approximately 1.5 million data points per hour. The data logging system includes 10 operating parameters, 10 exhaust gas temperatures, and 20 vehicle and engine temperatures. Accumulators are used to log time, distance, and fuel consumption. Manual data are also logged as an event reference. The data acquisition system allows an efficient manipulation of the data using high-speed computer facilities. The concept of the system is to provide sufficient instrumentation flexibility to permit measurements of emission and road performance parameters under realistic road conditions. 720213. Computer Assisted Valve Train Design and Development Part II. R. C. Dennis, Engine and Foundry Div., Ford Motor Co. This report describes the nature of two fundamental innovations in computer applications necessary to diffuse computer usage completely into the general design and development process - list processing and parametric representation of curves and surfaces. Acquisition of current change level information regarding engine design parameters looms as a major part of the total activity. List processing techniques are required for an operationally feasible procedure for data base maintenance. Parametric representation of curves and surfaces must be incorpo- rated so that engine assembly and detail drawings can be "stored" in computer memory. The payoff lies in estab- lishment of one nonredundant data base serving all activities related to the valve train. Such an integrated design engineering aid can be easily applied to other engine subsystems and ultimately the total engine. 720214. Design Refinement of Induction and Exhaust Systems Using Steady-State Flow Bench Tech- niques. G. F. Leydorf, Jr., R. G. Minty and M. Fingeroot, American Motors Corp. Application of steady-state flow-bench techniques to engine intake- and exhaust-system components usually produces significant gains in flow capability. This paper describes instrumentation, equipment, and procedures. Empirical design guidelines are presented. Case studies are used to illustrate the process of design refinement: a variety of flow-bench programs on induction- and ex- haust-system components is described; methods of attack are illustrated; reader insights into most-critical areas of tested components are presented. 720215. Water Pump Porous Bearing Design Analysis. L. L. Ting, D. W. Hall and J. E. Mayer, Jr., Scientific Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Applying hydrodynamic lubrication theory for porous bearings and boundary lubrication theory, this paper presents a method of analyzing the performance of a water-lubricated sleeve type porous bushing in an au- tomotive water pump design. Relations of bearing load capacity versus shaft speed have been obtained and compared for sintered iron-graphite bushings (a cermet material developed by the Ford Motor Co.), sintered iron or sintered bronze bushings, and steel bushings. The load capacity was computed, based on a minimum allowable film thickness during hydrodynamic operation, and on a maximum allowable temperature during boundary lubri-</page><page sequence="34">720216-720222 cation operation. The results show that sintered iron- graphite bushings are superior to sintered iron or sintered bronze bushings, as well as steel bushings, in this application, due to the lower coefficient of friction. The computations are in agreement with bench test and vehicle test results on an experimental water pump having a sintered iron-graphite bushing, both analytical and experimental results indicating acceptable performance of the coolant lubricated sintered iron-graphite bushing. The present analysis, therefore, offers a bearing design method for this or similar applications. 720216. Computer Models for Designing Dial-A-Ride Systems. F. J. Mason and J. R. Mumford, Ford Motor Co. Ford Motor Company has been active in the analysis and implementation of Dial-A-Ride, a form of public trans- portation in which door-to-door service is provided with a fleet of small vehicles operating in a shared-riding mode. A Dial-A-Ride system design methodology has been developed, a task which has revealed the nature of the modeling process for complex transportation systems. This methodology has been used successfully to design Dial-A-Ride systems currently operating in several cities. A discussion of this process as applied to Dial-A-Ride research is presented here. Several stages in the modeling process are identified. The analyst's knowledge of the system, his information needs, and the modeling technique chosen to satisfy these needs are described for each stage. A city for which Dial-A-Ride has been proposed is analyzed to illustrate each stage in the design methodology. The effectiveness of an analysis which utilizes several types of models to examine a complex system such as Dial-A-Ride is discussed. 720217. Dial-A-Bus for a University: Demand Response Service in a Many-To-One Environment. J. E. Gibson and R. A. White, Oakland University. The feasibility of a demand responsive bus system for Oakland University is analyzed and the recommended plan is presented. Oakland is an isolated campus, located approximately 25 miles north of Detroit, between Rochester and Pontiac, in a relatively low population density area. The University is primarily a commuter institution, with almost 100% of its 5000 commuter students traveling to the campus in personal automobiles. There is no form of public transportation serving the University, except the personal taxi. Oakland's policy is to construct parking lots to accommodate the high commuter volume. As early as 1976, the University will have to consider building parking structures to keep the lots within a reasonalbe walking distance from the center of campus. This paper examines an alternative mode of trans- portation for Oakland. Based on an analysis of potential demand and a transportation simulation, the University should implement a four-bus system to link Oakland with the Rochester community. Each 12-passenger vehicle would be flexibly routed on demand within a quadrant of the Rochester community; the system could be operating by the beginning of the Fall term 1972. 720218. Demand Bus System for New Residential Area in Japan. Ichiroh Kaneshige and Yukio Funaya, Isuzu Motors Ltd.; Yasumasa Sakano and Toru Ogawa, Fujitsu Ltd. In recent years, many papers have dealt with the demand responsive bus system as a promising new transportation system for urban and suburban areas. In this paper, the authors show the algorithms of a demand bus system that is able to control trips from many origins to many destinations and their simulation tech- niques. A case study of this system in a developed Japanese newly residential area is illustrated. From an investigation of the case study results, this system seems to be applicable. The authors have developed a digital, fully automatic communication and control system and a bus body design for the implementation of demand bus service. An outline is described in the latter part of the paper. 720219. A Case Study of the Economic Feasibility of a Demand-Responsive T ransportation System. Thomas F. Golob and Richard L. Gustafson, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper presents an analysis of the economic feasibility of a demand-responsive transportation system employing driver-operated vehicles on existing street networks. The system is designed to meet the general public transpor- tation needs of a suburban community. The analysis follows traditional economic theory in developing demand and supply curves for the transportation service as a consumer good, followed by an investigation of the equilibrium between demand and supply under various market conditions. Cost models specifically applicable to a transportation service with demand-responsive attrib- utes are formulated to calculate the system supply functions, and an attitudinal survey is employed to generate estimates of demand in the case study commu- nity. The demand and supply equilibrium situations are investigated with respect to funding alternatives and sensitivity to changes in supply and demand variables. 720222. Applications to Lead Vinyl Noise Barriers in Transportation Equipment. Charles L. Meteer, Ferro Corp. Lead vinyl coated fabrics, new composite vinyl films, and molding compounds have been developed that have application as flexible sound barriers in transportation and recreational equipment. The material consisting of fine lead particles disbursed in PVC compounds for coating, casting films, extrusion, injection molding, ther- mal form sheets, and rotational coasting combines the high mass of lead and the properties and formability of 109</page><page sequence="35">720223-720232 110 vinyl. These composites provide a limp high mass sound barrier material. 720223. Description of a Universal Pulling Machine. Ulrich W. Seiffert, Volks wagenwerk AG. Considerations for improved vehicle safety and govern- ment regulations required, among other things, tests on seat belts and seat belt anchorages-points. Starting with a single pulling cylinder for the introduction of the forces, a pulling machine with nine separate pulling cylinders was developed. These nine tensioning cylinders are operated hydraulically from a central unit. Each cylinder can be operated singly or in parallel with another. The operation of the cylinders is controlled by an electronic unit that compares the voltage signals representing the required and the actual values. The regulating characteristics are travel or position control, speed control, and force control. The principle of the test machine and objectives during different tests - for example, checking the strength of seat belts, seat belt anchorage points, door and roof rigidity, and simulation of a frontal crash with quasi-static deformation of the vehicle front-end - are described in this paper. 720224. Investigation of Vehicle Side Impact Stiffness - Comparison of Static and Dynamic Tests. Hartmut Rau, Institute for Automobile Engi- neering Technical University (Berlin). The purpose of this investigation on vehicle side-impact stiffness and the comparison of the static and dynamic tests was to contribute guidelines for a final test procedure with two advantages: to be, on the one hand, simply practicable and reproducible and, on the other hand, to provide results corresponding as close as possible to real accidents. Additionally, the investigation emphasized testing of side parts significant to the objectives of the test: door only, door and sill, or door, sill and roof. New cars as , well as heavily rusted vehicles were used for the test. Therefore this paper also treats the question of what degree a test of only new cars will be useful, without considering the state of corrosion of older vehicles. 720225. Laboratory Testing for Evaluation of Passenger Car Roof Intrusion Resistance Strength. Johnny M. Petty, Ford Motor Co. A test facility and procedure have been developed for use in evaluating passenger car roof intrusion resistance strength in the laboratory. This facility and procedure produce reliable and repeatable data which permit numerical comparison of separate test bodies of vehicles and automatically indicate performance through the use of an X,Y,Y plotter. The test facility consists of three parts: an adjustable structural frame for supporting the test unit in position for test, a hydraulic loading system for applying the load, and instrumentation for load and placement readout. A complete description of the facility is presented, with emphasis on the advantages of dual readout of data. The test procedure is also detailed, with description of sample preparation, mounting the test unit, and the graphical addition of curves. 720226. Simulation of Rollover with a Dynamic Roof Crush Test. Ulrich W. Seiffert, Volks wagen werk AG. Tests to simulate rollovers are currently very often criticized because of the nonreproducibility of the tests and their results. There are test procedures that attempt to simulate vehicle rollovers, for example, rollovers initiated . by a ramp, rollovers initiated by inertial movement of a vehicle positioned on a slope on a car which is stopped rapidly, drop test of upside-down vehicle, and static roof crush test. In addition, another test procedure is used by Volkswagen. A flat impact plate equal to the empty weight of the vehicle is dropped from a defined height onto the roof of the vehicle. The vehicle can be mounted on a bed at various angles relative to the impact plate. The results with this simple test method provide a comparative scale for roof rigidity rather than an absolute comparison with dynamic vehicle rollover roof rigidity. Besides the problems of conducting reproducible tests to simulate the deformation during rollovers, the problem of definition and evaluation of survival space is described. Based on the definitions that exist today, the paper concludes that it is impossible to define a fixed survival space for assessing the behavior of vehicle roofs during rollover simulation tests. 720231. Relating Instrument Panel Visibility and Driver Perception Time. James L. Sauter and Robert B. Kerchaert, Chrysler Corp. For the instrument panel designer, good visibility means providing clear, legible, and easy-to-understand instru- ments and controls free from obstructions, shadows, and inadequate lighting. Unfortunately, most of these pro- visions are subjective in nature and it is ultimately the designer or group of designers who must decide what is "good visibility." In order to remove some of this subjectivity, a study was undertaken by Chrysler Corp. to find a more objective approach to measuring visibility. In particular, this study dealt with measuring in a quantitative manner the readability of letter patterns used on instruments, controls, and indicators. This report, which covers the main results of the study, deals with the effects of such diverse factors as driver age, illumination and letter size on a driver's perception time - the time it takes for a driver to take his eyes off the road and read a target on his instrument panel. 1972 SA E Transactions 720232. A Procedure for Measuring Instrument Panel Visibility. Robert B. Kerchaert and James L. Sauter, Chrysler Corp. A procedure has been developed for measuring the relative visibility of automotive instrument panel graphics</page><page sequence="36">720233-720238 and components. Through use of a Luckiesh-Moss Visibility Meter, discreet values of visibility can be assigned to visual targets and related to driver reaction time. Also, eyes off the road lapsed time boundaries may be established which will define visibility requirements necessary to serve the total driver population. These requirements can be translated into meaningful guidelines or standards for visibility attributes such as size, shape, color, contrast, and position of graphics, controls, and indicators.

A study has been made of motor vehicle driver equipment in order to determine the most desirable design features and the optimum grouping of electrical controls condu- cive with minimum concious thought and physical effort in location and operation under any given set of conditions. Consideration is given to the psychological aspects of control operating noise level and action "feel," to styling and standardization of layout with the ultimate objective of driver fatigue reduction, and to a worthwhile contri- bution in road safety improvement. 720234. Rental Car Diagnostic Techniques. Robert F. Cahill, International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp. Automobiles in rental service are hard used and need quality inspection for the safety and comfort of rental agency customers. Employee training is only partially successful. An automobile inspection machine combining man and machine capabilities to match the defined goals and limitations of rental car inspection is described. Machine and driver combine to check 22 items including lights, tire pressure, tread depth, horn, brake function, radio, windshield wipers and washers, heater, gas tank, cleanliness, etc. 720235. Vehicle Diagnosis as an Integral Part of an Advanced Automotive Service System. E. Spengler, Volks wagen werk AG. This paper presents an automotive service concept developed by Volks wagen werk AG Service Division. It is based on the knowledge that the complex tasks of automotive service can best be solved by coordinating the development of products and service methods, and that automotive service should be viewed as an integrated system of various "subactivities," with each one being optimized to increase the efficiency of the overall system. Vehicle diagnosis is such a subactivity. A new data logging and processing system as a major step toward the implementation of an integrated automotive service system is described. 720236. Diagnostic Equipment for Army Vehicles. Donald S. Sarna, Fred Pradko and Daniel F. Ancona, U. S. Army Tank- Au tomo tive Com- mand. The Army diagnostic equipment program for the support of automotive material is presented. Three generations of equipment will be discussed: the first generation is a family of computer controlled automatic test equipment for automatic diagnosis of a complete vehicle; in the second generation, a transducer kit will be permanently installed on-board the vehicles with provision for rapid connection to the computer; the third generation will be an on-board go/no-go system to indicate the condition of major component (no external test equipment required). 720237. Some Factors Affecting Gas Turbine Passenger Car Emissions. C. A. Amann, W. R. Wade and M. K. Yu, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The intent of this paper is to put into proper perspective the relationships among the vehicle, the thermodynamic cycle, and the combustion process as they relate to exhaust emissions from a gas turbine-powered passenger car. The influence of such factors as car size, installed power, regeneration, and other cycle variables on level road load fuel economy, and on the production of oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, are examined. In limited checks against experimental data, the mathemat- ical model of the combustor used in this study has proved to be a reliable indicator of emission trends. The calculated emission levels are not final, however, with deficiencies subject to improvement as new combustor concepts are developed. Discussion: A. F. McLean, Ford Motor Co.; H. C.

Greenwald, Research Labs., United Aircraft Corp. The feasibility of a simple-cycle gas turbine engine for automobiles is analyzed by means of comparison with Otto-cycle engines for automobiles. Applicable technol- ogy is reviewed with emphasis on centrifugal compressor technology, which has demonstrated pressure ratios of better than 10: 1. The design point of a simple-cycle 150 hp automobile engine based on these components is pre- sented, together with estimated torque and fuel-flow characteristics for the entire range of possible engine performance, derived from engine-cycle analysis pro- grams. The results of a vehicle performance computer program designed to evaluate candidates for this appli- cation include time/speed/distance performance esti- lll</page><page sequence="37">720239-720251 112 mates for maximum acceleration as well as fuel economy and emissions estimates for pertinent driving cycles. Summaries of manufacturing cost estimates are presented for several candidate gas turbine engines. A speculative overall cost for both four and ten years of ownership is estimated based primarily on these fuel economy and manufacturing cost derivations. It is concluded that the simple-cycle gas turbine engine studied is sufficiently attractive as a low-pollution automobile engine for the post- 1975 decade to warrant full-scale demonstration as soon as possible. 720239. Characteristics of Urban Bus Driving Cycles. Roy A. Renner, International Research &amp; Technol- ogy Corp.; and Richard D. Lawhorn, Instru- mentation Associates. In preparation for the California Steam Bus Project, diesel-powered city buses were road-tested over two contrasting routes (driving cycles). Special instrumenta- tion was used to continuously monitor distance, speed, acceleration, road gradient, and engine rpm. From these data, profiles of power requirements were derived, together with cumulative values of propulsive and braking energy. The driving cycles were characterized by statistical distribution functions of key variables. 720241. Principles of X-Ray Stress Measurements. M. E. Hilley, University of South Florida. Basic stress-strain principles of elasticity theory are related to elastic strains that could occur in metals and alloys. The equated relationships are expressed as a function of the diffraction line shift that occurs because of a variation in the spacing d of the atomic planes in a crystalline material that is due to applied or residual stress. This fractional change in d is a strain from which stress can be calculated and which can be determined by the change angular position of a diffraction x-ray beam. 720242. Equipment and Methods of X-Ray Stress Anal- ysis. C. F. Jatczak, The Timken Co. The measurement of stress by x-ray diffraction techniques is considered from both the technical and practical viewpoints. Basic principles are discussed and the tech- niques and x-ray instrumentation presently in use here and abroad are described and compared from the standpoints of accuracy, precision, and time required for stress determination. Both diffractometer and film or camera techniques are covered. Other factors discussed are alignment requirements, selection of optimum in- strumental conditions, required correction to raw diffrac- tometer data, specimen surface preparation, and stress constant evaluation methods. Step-by-step procedures for the novice with illustra- tions of typical data and calculations are finally presented for the two exposure and sin2 diffractometer techniques and for the two-exposure camera method. 1972 SAE Transactions 720243. Applications of Residual Stress Measurements. R. W. Buenneke, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Two applications of x-ray residual stress measurements in steel are reported. One application shows how residual stresses have a direct bearing on fatigue strength caused by varying material and heat treatment. The other application shows how x-ray diffraction measurements can help determine the cause of grinder cracking in carburized and hardened steel parts. Grinder cracking occurs by overheating the surface which produces tensile residual stresses that exceed the fracture strength of the steel. Also, there appears to be a relationship between retained austenite content and the grinder cracking phenomenon. 1972 SAE Transactions 720244. Results of Interlaboratory X-Ray Stress Meas- urements. W. P. Evans, Caterpillar Tractor Co., R. A. Hanson, The Fafnir Bearing Co., J. A. Larson, Scientific Res. Staff, Ford Motor Co.; and R. E. Ricklefs, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The data from five residual stress round robins run by the X-Ray Fatigue Division of the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee have been studied. Many factors affecting precision have been isolated during 16 years of testing. Some of these relate to the sample - material hardness and geometry - while others, such as alignment, are instrumental or procedural. Laboratories using proper techniques can achieve an interlaboratory standard deviation of 2.5 ksi on a stressed, hardened steel cylinder. 1972 SAE Transactions 720251. The Effect of Fuel Hydrocarbon Composition on Exhaust Hydrocarbon and Oxygenate Emissions. Eric E. Wigg, Raymond J. Campion and William Lewis Peterson, Esso Research and Engineering Co. Fuel-exhaust compositional relationships are derived for exhaust hydrocarbons and aldehydes using data obtained with 18 full-boiling-range gasolines used as fuel in a late model vehicle. The agreement found between the data from the present work and those obtained by others in similar studies indicates that the relationships should be sufficiently general to apply to a large segment of the current vehicle population. The present data indicate that aromatic hydrocarbon and aromatic aldehyde emissions are linearly related to fuel aromatic content while exhaust olefin and aliphatic aldehyde emissions show an inverse relationship. Regression analysis of the aromatic hydro- carbon and aromatic aldehyde data expressed as a function of fuel aromaticity gives fuel aromatic coeffi- cients of 0.49 and 0.41 for the hydrocarbon and aldehyde expressions respectively. Exhaust photochemical reactivity calculations, using a composite reactivity scale, predict that fuel aromatic content has little influence on exhaust reactivity. The fuel-exhaust compositional relationships are shown to be insensitive to the nature of the driving cycle. A comparison of data obtained using the 1968,</page><page sequence="38">720253-720256 1972, and 1975 Federal test procedures shows the existence of only minor differences in exhaust compo- sition. However, elimination of the cold start from the 1972 test procedure did have a significant effect on the results. Discussion: W.

Pierrard and Richard A. Crane, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. Laboratory and field tests were conducted to determine how changes in some gasoline compositional factors might affect atmospheric visibility and soiling caused by exhaust particulate matter emitted from late model automobiles. In the laboratory tests, measurements of light scattering, soiling index, and mass emission rates of air-suspendable particles were made on diluted exhaust from cars driven on a programmed chassis dynamometer. These tests showed that light scattering, and also soiling, were increased by increasing the aromatic content, removing lead antiknocks, or increasing the combined amounts of sulfur and phosphorus in gasoline. The individual effects of sulfur and phosphorus were not determined. Light scattering and soiling appeared to correlate more closely with the volume, rather than the mass, of the air- suspendable particulate matter. Field tests were carried out in an unused, 6200 ft long, Pennsylvania turnpike tunnel using two matched four-car fleets. In these tests, the air in the tunnel was continuously sampled with a filter unit. The air in the tunnel sampled during the tests with the cars using the unleaded gasolines soiled the filters 57% more than the air sampled during the tests with the cars using the leaded gasolines. Reduction in visibility caused by air-suspended particulate matter was determined at the end of each test by measuring the intensity of white light passed through a 2615 ft air path in the tunnel. The particulate matter from the unleaded fleet caused nearly twice as much decrease in light transmission as did that from the leaded fleet. The above results were obtained with 1969, 1970, and 1971 models of production cars. Three 1970 model cars equipped with advanced emission control systems con- sisting of thermal reactors, exhaust gas recirculation, and particulate traps were tested with leaded and unleaded gasolines. The mass emission rates of air-suspendable particles and the light scattering were lower than with the production cars, but no significant effect of gasoline lead content was found. The effects of changes in aromatic content and sulfur and phosphorus levels were not investigated. Discussion: D. T. Wade, Esso Research and Engineering Co.; and J. S.

A proposed set of modifications, which, in combination with a mixture-Optimizer, enables a spark-ignition engine to accept air-fuel mixtures as lean as 22 23-1/2:1 without impairment of drivability, will permit the simultaneous reduction of all pollutant exhaust emissions, HC, CO, and NOx, to a very low level. Under such circumstances, the true best economy mixture largely coincides with the mixture ratio that minimizes the exhaust emissions. The mixture-Optimizer is a feedback type of electronic control device which automatically selects for a carburetor or fuel injection system the air-fuel ratio that yields the minimum fuel consumption for any given power output. For all driving conditions, other than idling and coasting, the minimum fuel consumption occurs at mixture ratios close to the borderline misfire limit. Therefore the mixture-Optimizer, by seeking these mixture ratios, tends to reduce all pollutant exhaust emissions that are under legal control. It also helps drivability by discouraging engine stalling. The mechanism of the mxiture-Optimizer is described, and results of simulated tests are presented. 720255. Exhaust Hydrocarbon Emissions from Gasoline Engines-Surface Phenomena. W. W. Haskell and C. E. Legate, Shell Oil Co. A detailed understanding of the surface phenomena associated with exhaust hydrocarbon (HC) emissions is required to be certain that all avenues of emission control, internal to the combustion chamber, have been exploited. This paper presents information obtained on a single- cylinder research engine, which supports the following hypotheses: there exists a critical piston top land-to-bore clearance above which HC emissions decrease sharply; the presence of an oxidatively active catalytic surface in the combustion chamber increases HC emissions; using a clean engine operating on a fuel containing 5% lubricating oil, HC emissions increase within minutes to a level comparable to that obtained with equilibrium deposits; the first parcel of gas to leave the exhaust valve contains an order of magnitude lower concentration of HCs than does the total mixed exhaust; and a cylinder bore tapered outward towards the top eliminates oil-droplet formation in a motored engine. In order to predict exhaust HC emissions from the top land volume, an equation is derived which accounts for the effects of piston and bore expansion, blowby, and cylinder-pressure ratio. This equation is applied to literature data obtained on the decrease of HC emissions with an increase in engine speed. 720256. Engine Speed and Load Effects on Charge Dilution and Nitric Oxide Emission. William R. Aiman, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The effects of engine speed and load on nitric oxide 113</page><page sequence="39">720257-720263 114 emission were investigated with a single-cylinder engine operated at conditions representative of those found in the 7-mode, 7-cycle Federal Emissions Test Cycle. The fuel-air mixture was constant at 83% of stoichiometric and the spark settings were optimized. Nitric oxide emission increased as engine speed and load were increased. The effects were interdependent, in that, the effect of speed was greatest at low load and the effect of load was greatest at low speed. In addition, both speed and load effects were larger when valve overlap was higher. Engine speed and load affected exhaust nitric oxide concentration primarily via influences on charge dilution. This finding explains the interdependency of the speed and load effects, and also why they depended on valve overlap. 720257. Some Design Aspects for High-Speed Snow- mobile Safety. Edgar Rose, Outboard Marine Corp. This paper describes analytical and experimental methods used to ensure a maximum amount of safety in the design of a high-speed snowmobile. Constructional features of the resultant record-breaking 140 mph snowmobile Pegasus are related to the various specifications consid- ered essential to operator safety. Development of this vehicle involved investigation of crucial parameters such as yaw and drag on directional stability while operating at high speeds. These effects and other aerodynamic influ- ences are explained as they affect single-track and dual-track vehicles. The final design of this snowmobile incorporated measures to counter adverse tendencies during high-speed operation, as well as backup devices such as a rollover bar, auxiliary braking system, fire protection, and an escape mechanism. 720258. Snowmobiling with Associated Maxillofacial In- juries. Conrad I. Karleen, University of Min- nesota Hospitals. In the United States and Canada 1,600,000 snowmobiles have been manufactured, some of them capable of speeds up to 80 mph. Good legislation, safety training programs, and more safety features in the snowmobiles are essential to decrease the rising accident toll. For example, changes in the windshield construction which might reduce facial injuries are recommended. Hospital charts of snowmobile accidents are reviewed describing location of body injury, mechanism of the injury, time of day, age, sex, and cause of death. 720259. Practical Snowmobility for Ordnance Vehicles. Hjormund Kummen, Pacific Car and Foundry Co. Off-road vehicles, to negotiate snowcovered terrain reliably and economically, must comply with a narrow range of design parameters. The practical lessons of past experience are evaluated, indicating the superiority of the four-tracked vehicle configuration. The design details essential to achieve snowmobility are indicated. Engineering information and the current state-of- the-art indicate that a functional, low-cost ordnance vehicle can be designed for use during all seasons in the Arctic. 1972 SA E Transactions 720260. The McCulloch BP-399-T Snowmobile Engine and Its Installation. Harry I. Hazzard, McCulloch Corp. The BP-399-T and other engines of this family were planned as snowmobile and ATV engines with particular regard to balancing. They show shaking forces of 14-30% of those of conventional designs. Engine balance becomes a major factor, wherein vibrational forces should be considered in two classes: those which are symmetrical about the e.g. and cause translations of the e.g. through space, and those forces which are unsymmetrical and cause the body to rotate or rock. The mechanics of design and development are discussed, along with installation problems. 720261. A Hybrid Computer Simulation of the Recre- ational Snowmobile. James A. Newman, Shui- chih Cheng and Vipin K. Suri, University of Ottawa. This paper describes the development of a hybrid- computer simulation of a recreational snowmobile. The vehicle has been mathematically represented by a dis- placement-driven, damped nonlinear spring-mass system with two degrees of freedom. The analog circuit and the logic level control system of the analog/hybrid computer is discussed. The use of a hybrid system using Hytran Operational Interpreter to perform Off-line and On-line checks is also discussed. Finally, a method to display a visual representation of the vehicle on an oscilloscope screen is presented. The simulation permits vehicle designers to vary at will the various design parameters and to observe immediately the effect of so doing. 1972 SA E Transactions 720262. Interior Cab Design of the IH Transtar. R. E. McAfee, International Harvester Co. Driver environment encompasses physical room, control placement, visibility, interior noise level, occupant pro- tection, and temperature control.

Limitations of the standard are touched upon. Conventional approaches to impart fire retardance to vinyls, polyolefins, urethane foams, ABS, polyester, and carpeting are reviewed. Potential problems associated with each of the approaches include fogging, dripping, staining, low-temperature flexibility, durability, effect on physical properties, and cost. 720264. Commercial Vehicle Occupational Health Haz- ards. James M. Miller, The University of Mich- igan. The Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 may have much importance to the truck cab designer. The levels of noise, heat, and carbon monoxide to which the truck operator is exposed may be a health and safety hazard. While current standards for these hazards have not been directly applied to commercial carriers, it is predicted that they will be in the near future. Some current research in the noise and carbon monoxide areas in particular is cited; legal standards for these are projected for the designer's use. The inclusion of air conditioning as standard equipment in trucks may be a realistic way to meet new standards. 1972 SAE Transactions 720265. A Procedure for Designing Against Fatigue Failure of Notched Parts. Lee E. Tucker, Deere &amp; Co. A procedure for designing against fatigue failure of notched parts is presented. It is based on measuring nominal loads or strains and estimating notch root stresses and strains using Neuber's rule. Other inputs to the procedure are axial smooth specimen cyclic stress-strain response, fatigue properties, and fatigue notch factor. Miner's cumulative damage rule is applied to the local stress-strain history and fatigue life predicted. Examples are given where life predictions are compared to labo- ratory test results.

Crossland, The Queen's University of Belfast. The paper reports data on block-program fatigue testing of a simple cantilever specimen with a stress concentra- tion, the specimen being made of SAE 5130 steel. The various programs investigated were based on a normal distribution with a crest factor of 4 and were aimed at accelerating fatigue testing. From tests on programs with 4, 8, and 16 stress levels, it was concluded that at least 8 stress loads were required to simulate accurately the normal distribution. Tests in which various stress levels were omitted showed that stress levels S/0 &lt; 1.75 contributed nothing to fatigue damage, and consequently they could be omitted from the program resulting in a saving of 87% in testing time. Stress levels in the range 1.75 &lt; S/ &lt; 4 had a damaging effect, and even the one cycle of S/0 = 4 in each full program of 4000 cycles caused significant damage. This indicates the great importance of the choice of crest factor. 1972 SAE Transactions 720267. Fatigue Crack Propagation in Steel Weldments. F. V. Lawrence, Jr. and W. H. Munse, Univer- sity of Illinois. Fatigue tests have been conducted on low carbon steel butt welds containing lack of penetration defects. The growth of fatigue cracks from the lack of penetration defects was monitored by radiography. These measure- ments allowed the total fatigue life to be separated into periods of crack initiation and crack propagation. It was found that the rate of crack growth conformed to the expression: da/dN = 0.27 X 1013(AK)58. The ini- tiation period was found to occupy approximately one- half of the total fatigue life and to consist of the cycles necessary to shake down the residual stress in the weld and to form the lack of penetration defect into an active fatigue crack. 720268. The Effect of Case Carbon Content and Heat Treatment on the Pitting Fatigue of 8620 Steel. J. P. Sheehan, Packer Engineering Assoc.; and M. A. H. Howes, IIT Research Institute. The pitting fatigue of carburized 8620 steel in lubricated concentrated contact has been investigated over a range of case carbon contents (0.72-1.2%) and after direct quench and re-heat treatments. Several surface finishes were used, including the as-heat treated surface, ground finishes, and polished finishes. Testing was carried out on geared roller test machines. Surface finish was found to be the variable having the most pronounced effect on fatigue resistance, the as-heat treated surface having the greatest resistance to pitting failure. Pitting fatigue also decreases with increase of case carbon content. 1972 SAE Transactions 720269. Automated Roadway Transportation System Con- figurations. Glenn E. Wanttaja, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A number of new concepts for moving people by means of automatically controlled vehicles on separated automated roadways have emerged in the last few years. The Metro Guideway transportation system concept described in this paper makes use of a common automated roadway and an integrated multimode system of automatically controlled vehicles for public transportation, personal private trans- portation, and goods movement. The objectives for the multimodal Metro Guideway system concepts are reviewed and a methodology is presented for system evaluation from the perspective of user costs and benefits and nonuser impacts.

Computer Simulation for an Automated Roadway Network. Larry L. Howson, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the development and preparation for a simulation on the digital computer of an automated roadway network for a new urban transportation system concept called the Metro Guideway, using the 1990 Detroit region as the case study area. The objectives of the simulation are to determine the performance of the system as a function of various design parameters, to develop operational computer programs, and to evaluate the computer hardware needs of a real-world system. The discussion includes a brief description of the case study area and an overview of the mathematical and computer models. 720272. Evaluation of the Operating Conditions on a Detroit Dual-Mode Vehicle Network. Robert G. Stefanek and Stephen J. Kiselewich, Ford Motor Co. The success of urban automated vehicle networks will depend very strongly on the availability of an efficient traffic management strategy for such networks. Previous papers have discussed an automated network traffic management strategy, known as cycle preprogramming, which appears potentially capable of accomplishing the necessary coordination of vehicle flows in a large automated network. This paper develops a methodology by means of which the efficiency of the cycle prepro- gramming strategy in managing traffic in a large network can be studied. The methodology is then used to analyze the operating conditions on an example automated network for the Detroit area. 720273. Motor Vehicle Noise Generation and Potential Abatement. Robert L. Paullin and Harvey B. Safeer, Office of the Secretary of Transportation. In May 1969, the Department of Transportation initiated a study on the magnitude of the transportation noise problem and its potential abatement. This study has resulted in the first comprehensive review and analysis of transportation noise in the United States. As an aid in conducting the analysis, and for continuing use in noise reduction efforts, four computer simulation models were developed. By using the models, it was possible to establish the noise levels which might be expected for different transportation modes as a function of the traffic characteristics peculiar to that mode. In addition, an understanding was developed of the tech- nical, economic, and legal limits of potential abatement means for each transportation mode. The study also dealt with the responsibility and ability of public and private groups to provide the necessary implementation programs to achieve noise abatement. The need for government standards and regulations was reviewed as was the need for additional research and development of successful means for reducing noise. This paper presents the results of the noted study as they relate to motor vehicles, and the program of the Office of Noise Abatement of the Office of the Secretary, Department of Transportation, for achieving reasonable noise reduction consistent with the Secretary's desire for an integrated transportation system. 720274. Noise Source Definition-Exterior Passenger Ve- hicle Noise. R. J. Vargovick, Ford Motor Co. A drive-by exterior noise program was conducted to determine the contribution of each car noise source - engine/exhaust, fan, and tire/roadway - to the total exterior drive-by noise of a passenger vehicle. A 1970 high- and low-power sedan and a 1970 high- and low-power sporty compact were utilized in the test sequence. Octave-band and dBA sound levels were recorded with the microphone positioned 25 ft away for various modes of vehicle operation at cruise and wide-open- throttle conditions. Results indicate for cruise (road-load) conditions that: 1. Except for high-performance vehicles, the pre- dominant source of exterior vehicle noise about 500 Hz is tire/roadway noise. 2. The major sources of exterior noise below 500 Hz are both engine/exhaust noise and tire/roadway noise. 3. Fan noise is an insignificant contributor to pas- senger vehicle exterior noise at present noise levels. 1972 SAE Transactions 720275. Measurement of Automotive Passby Noise. Ralph K. Hillquist and Richard A. Bettis, General Motors Proving Ground. Procedures for measurement of noise emitted by various automotive vehicles have been developed and refined by various technical committees of the SAE. These proce- dures are used for evaluation of vehicles during devel- opment and also as the basis for noise regulations. Recent work on the parameters of these procedures indicates that the site used, the vehicle operator, and the ambient weather conditions are all significant factors in the accuracy of test results. Variation between samples of like vehicles also is a significant factor in the attempt to determine noise level characteristics of a given model. Revision of these procedures to minimize the variation in results attributable to variation in test parameters, and to become more representative of typical operating modes of the vehicle, is essential. 1972 SAE Transactions 720276.

Each situation was assigned to one of three categories of annoyance sensitivity depending upon the attitudinal</page><page sequence="42">720277-720283 factors related to the source. Each category had a linear relationship between noise intensity and annoyance.

A Summary of Engine-Propeller Interactions. John B. Woodward, III, University of Michigan. The interactions of a marine propeller and its propulsion engine are surveyed, with particular concern for the interaction as seen from the engine end. It is pointed out that linking characteristics of engine and propeller should be considered together when marine engineers design a propulsion plant. Propeller characteristics and engine characteristics are reviewed, with a suggestion that, as a compromise between efficiency and vibration excitation, the designer choose from a number of blades, the area of blades being a compromise between efficiency and having sufficient thrust area to avoid cavitation. Matching of engine and propeller in several situations is then dis- cussed. Problems of off-design conditions and margin allowance are included. 720278. A Review of Practical Waterjet Propulsion. Howard R. Apollonio, Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. A decade's evolution and application of practical waterjet propulsion is described. Reasons for selecting types of pump elements are identified on the basis of efficiency and flexibility to suit the most commonly encountered engines and craft types. Preferred configurations for water inlets and control devices are described. Experience with propulsive efficiency, reliability, cost, boat and engine matching, maintenance, maneuverability, cavitation, and corrosion is discussed. Favorable performance in these areas compared with existing propeller systems is shown. 720279. Engine Propulsion Matching for High-Speed Craft. Richard Hecker, Naval Ship Research and Development Center. The study discussed in this paper has been made to illustrate the ease with which engineers can choose propellers described in available literature to match high-speed ship designs, saving time and cost incurred in waiting for individual computer services. Specifically an investigation was made utilizing current literature to determine the performance of supercavitating versus conventional propeller in relation to hydrofoil craft. Powering requirements are given for a typical hydrofoil craft, and a preliminary choice of propeller diameter and pitch ratio has been made from published series and experimental work. It is shown that the supercavitating propeller already documented fulfills the requirements of high-speed craft at speeds exceeding 100 knots, whereas at speeds greater than 60 knots the conventional propeller fails. This paper also shows that supercavitating sections have good drag-to-lift ratios when the propeller is driven at high rotative speeds. Mention is made of the successful application of lightweight gas turbines to marine use. 1972 SA E Transactions 720280. 50 Years of Marine Gear Evolution. Richard C. McRoberts, Twin Disc, Inc.

These provide both design flexibility and quick reaction to change requests. Many new circuit approaches to single power supply operational amplifiers, comparators, lamp and/or relay drivers, timing circuits, and voltage regu- lators are presented and typical performance character- istics are given. Simplicity is emphasized to allow multiple circuits in a single package to reduce the cost/circuit function. 1972 SA E Transactions 720282. A Digital Memory Fuel Controller for Gasoline Engines. M. Williams, Joseph Lucas (Electrical) Co. Ltd. A digital memory fuel control unit has been developed for otto cycle engines which enables low pollution exhaust emissions to be achieved, coupled with good drivability and mechanical performance. The unit has been tested on a Triumph 2.5 PI vehicle, and the practical results achieved fall just short of the requirements of the 1975 federal and California legislation. The electronic controller receives signals relating to the engine's instantaneous operating conditions and, by reference to its digital memory, computes the optimum fuel required. The capacity of the controller's memory is effectively increased by an interpolation technique. The controller operates as an on-line process control com- puter, of cigar box dimensions, which is able to exist in the arduous automotive environment. 720283. Computerized Energy Distribution and Auto- mated Control. P. W. Sognefest, R. L. Anderson, B. E. Estes, III and R. G. Nedbal, Essex International, Inc. A digital computerized energy distribution and automated control system is being developed at Essex International's 117</page><page sequence="43">720284-720287 118 Vehicular Research and MOS Manufacturing Facilities in Pittsburgh. The control system is comprised of a central computer in conjunction with a digital multiplexing system. Prototypes of the system have been tested: the subsystems of the car that were tested include fuel injection, ignition, power assist, comfort, and lighting. In its final form this system will make decisions for all the subsystems on the automobile. For example, antiskid braking, gear selection, automatic speed control, and driver displays will be incorporated. The system will evolve onto the car in pieces such as engine control, lighting, and automatic temperature control. Then, as economic factors dictate, the components will evolve into a single computerized system. The automatic temperature control system is economical today. The central computer will be economical for certain functions in 2-3 years. 720284. Data Retrieval by Accident Reconstruction for Safer Vehicle Design. Richard I. Emori, Uni- versity of California, Los Angeles; and Jack D. Baird, University of Southern California, Los Angeles. The effectiveness of safety design must be justified in terms of real automobile accidents with human occupants. Since it is far too dangerous to use human subjects in full-scale collision experiments, substitutes are usually studied; experiments performed with dummies and math- ematical models. Then we still have to extrapolate the results from the substitutes to the reality. Full-scale collision experiments with human occupants could be performed by reconstructing real automobile accidents accurately. To retrieve the most needed data for further improvements in safety design and to translate actual accidents as controlled experiments, an engineered meth- od was developed to reconstruct accidents. It synthesizes previously validated analytical and experimental knowl- edges pertinent to automobile collision mechanics. The method was applied to an actual accident, indicating that the methodology is sound and accurate. 1972 SAE Transactions 720285. Stress Analysis of a Cantilevered Thin- Wall Cylinder Within a Cylindrical Cavity. R. S. Mezey, Sundstrand Corp.; and W. G. Gibbons, General Electric Co. A semiempirical procedure has been developed to deter- mine the stresses in a thin-wall cylinder extending from a block cavity and subjected to cantilever loading. A theoretical analysis produced the equations for direct bending stress and radial stress. The local stresses were experimentally determined via strain gage techniques. In addition, the experimental results indicated the angular location of the maximum local stress. Combination of the total axial stress and the radial stress sensibly provide the maximum shear stress applicable in design. 1972 SAE Transactions 720286. Field Adjustment and Inspection of Headlamp Aim. D. Walker, Ford Motor Co. Adjustment and inspection of headlamp aim may be accomplished by four methods: visual, optical, photoe- lectric, and mechanical. Visual aim is the simplest but the least accurate. Lateral accuracy is restricted by the ability of the driver to align the vehicle perpendicular to the aiming board and the difficulty of determining the edge of the high-intensity zone of the low-beam lamps. The precision of visual aim is considerably less than the tolerances prescribed in the SAE J599b, Lighting Inspection Code. An optical aimer projects a reduced image of the headlamp beam on a screen. Difficulty in visually determining the edge of the high-intensity zone of the low-beam lamps and inability to accurately align the aimer to the vehicle results in inaccurate measurement of headlamp aim. Two photoelectric aim systems are available. The field photoelectric aimer is designed on the assumption that the left edge of the high-intensity zone of the low-beam lamp is 17 in (at 25 ft) from the point of maximum intensity of the light pattern, and that the top edge of the high- intensity zone of the low-beam lamp is 1 1 in (at 25 ft) from the point of maximum intensity of the light pattern. These conditions may sometimes occur by coincidence, but not by design. Furthermore, no accurate method is provided for aligning the aimer to the vehicle. Consequently, the system lacks the required precision and accuracy for aim adjustment and inspection. The "Third Derivative" photoelectric aim system is accurate and precise but very expensive. However, mechanically aimable lamps can be aimed and inspected with mechanical aimers, which are less expensive and more adaptable to field or shop aim adjustment or inspection. Body variations and dog track reduce the accuracy of mechanical aimers. However, mechanical aimers, when used with mechanically aimable lamps, are more accurate than visual, optical, or photoelectric systems. Mechanical aimers are precise and are available at reasonable cost. Therefore, only mechanical aimers should be used for aim adjustment and inspection in the field and for service. 720287. An Analysis of Automatic Transmission Clutch- Plate Temperatures. K. Tataiah, Shell Oil Co. Automatic transmission clutch failures and rapid oxi- dation of the transmission fluid have sometimes been attributed to high temperatures in the clutch pack. For the purpose of estimating these temperatures, an analysis was made of the clutch system, and a solution was developed from the partial differential equations of heat conduction with appropriate boundary conditions. The solution thus obtained was verified experimentally. There were several important conclusions to this study. The maximum temperature rise occurs somewhat earlier than the end of the lockup time. The interface temperature rise increases as the lockup time decreases for a fixed amount of energy input. The ratio of heat flux</page><page sequence="44">720288-720293 entering the reaction plate to that entering the composite plate is not constant, as has been assumed by others. The heat absorbed by the fluid outside the clutch pack is negligible during the short lockup time. Temperature rises for some typical cases are computed. 720288. The Development of Auto Temp II. R. B. Caldwell, Ranco, Inc.; R. F. Johnson and R. A. Simon, Chrysler Corp. The development of the Auto Temp II Temperature Control System used in Chrysler Corp. vehicles is summarized. A description of the design, development, function, and manufacturing aspects of the control system is presented, with emphasis on unique control parameters, reliability, service-ability, and check-out of production assemblies. Auto Temp II was developed by Chrysler in conjunction with Ranco Incorporated. The servo-controlled, closed-loop system, which has a sensitivity of 0.5 F, utilizes a water-flow control valve for temperature control, along with a cold engine lockout. The basic components are: sensor string, servo, and amplifier. All automatic functions involving control of mass flow rate, temperature, and distribution of the air entering the vehicle, are encompassed in one control unit. All components are mechanically linked through the gear train and are responsive to the amplifier through the feedback potentiometer. 1972 SA E Transactions 720289. A Cost/Performance Comparison of Die Cast Zinc and Glass-Reinforced Thermoplastics. Lawrence S. Lazar, United States Testing Co., Inc.; and Donald C. Herrschaft, International Lead Zinc Research Organization, Inc. In an earlier paper, a series of comparison tests were described that verified the cost/performance advantage of die-cast zinc over five unreinforced, engineering ther- moplastics in tension, flexure, creep, impact, and fatigue when compared under identical test procedures and specimen geometries as dictated by plastics industry standards. Additional tests showed the superiority of die-cast zinc over these same thermoplastics in regard to thread strength, dimensional stability, heat distortion, weathering, flammability, and chemical stress cracking. This paper reports on a continuation of these same series of test procedures where die-cast zinc is compared with six 40% glass-reinforced thermoplastics. Again the results continue to show the cost/performance superiority of die-cast zinc over the reinforced thermoplastics tested. 720290. Corrosion-Resistant, High-Strength Clad Metal System for Hydraulic Brake Line Tubing. Robert Baboian, Texas Instruments Inc. A new clad metal system has been developed as a material for hydraulic brake line tubing. The material consists of a 1008 LCS/304 SS/1008 LCS composite in the ratio 45%/10%/45%. Laboratory experimental tests, accelerated life tests, and field tests were performed on brake tubing formed from this material. The results show that the brazed and ternecoat low-carbon steel/stainless steel/ low-carbon steel tubing has excellent corrosion resistance and high mechanical strength. The results are compared with those obtained with conventional brazed and ternecoat LCS brake tubing. 1972 SA E Transactions 720291. Formed-in-Place RTV Silicone Gaskets. M. A. Maudlin, Dow Corning Corp. The formed-in-place gasket concept consists of using a paste-type liquid silicone RTV (room temperature vul- canizing rubber) applied to the flange area of the components to be sealed and having the flanges squeeze out and form the liquid gasket on assembly. This system offers several advantages over the conventional precut or preformed gaskets. This system can replace all the static gaskets on a drive train (except head and manifold) and preform as well or better than the gaskets it replaces. Material cost can be reduced as can handling costs when the RTV is automatically applied. 720292. Considerations in the Selection of Materials for Miniaturized Automotive Terminals and Con- nectors. S. H. Butt, Olin Corp. Miniaturization of terminals, connectors, springs, and other contacts in automotive electric systems has imposed rigorous demands upon the principal materials used in their manufacture - copper alloys. This paper surveys the more important copper alloys and presents available data, including that from current research, which bear upon the problem of material selection. Various coppers, copper alloys, and groups of copper alloys are described, and a brief description of mechanical and electrical properties, corrosion performance, surface characteristics, and economics is presented. Comparative data for the various representative copper alloy groups are also presented. Such data includes comparison of mechanical strength - ultimate tensile, offset yield, and fatigue strengths, modulus of elasticity; corrosion resistance - general, stress, and crevice corro- sion, dezincification; and surface characteristics - contact resistance, solderability, plating performance. Study of the data indicates that there is no simple optimum choice for all applications. The designer and user should use the data as a guide in selection of materials for each application. 720293. (SP-367) Human Factors Methodology in the Design of the Driver's Workspace in Trucks. Peter Kyropoulos, Styling Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper is essentially a set of instructional notes intended for the use by those who want to familiarize themselves with the methodology of human factors as applied to the design of truck cabs. Careful study and use of the references is required if the notes are to be useful. The need for constructing mockups and for experiments 119</page><page sequence="45">720294-720299 120 using typical users as test subjects is repeatedly empha- sized. The basic elements of anthropometrics are re- viewed. Seeing is treated as the first step in the decision making process. It is the most important channel of communication between the driver, the vehicle, and the surrounding road and traffic. Similarly, control location and identification is a problem in communication between driver and vehicle. Control forces, seating and environ- mental requirements of comfort and alertness are re- viewed. Simulation and simulators are treated here as an essential part of experimental aspects of human factors design. The role of mathematical models is examined. A number of exercises accompany the text. The references list 34 texts and papers as well as 9 applicable SAE Recommended Practices. Illustrations are held to a minimum. 1972 SAE Transactions 720294. (SP-368) Design Consideration for Mounting a Beverage Body on a Truck Chassis. Julius P. Brauer, J. A. Hackney &amp; Sons, Inc. Because the truck chasis manufacturer and the beverage body manufacturer do not work cooperatively, many problems are encountered by the latter when he mounts the body he has built on the truck chassis. Some of the problems are caused by chassis design and some are the result of the chassis not being constructed according to recognized standards. This paper gives the truck chassis manufacturer a better appreciation of the chassis requirements for a beverage body by reviewing some of these problems and offering suggestions on how to solve them. The areas explored include: CA dimensions; the cab; the truck frame; rear axle alignment; spring length and deflection; the transmission, driveline and differential; brake assem- bly, brake boosters, and air tanks; air brake lines; air or oil filters; fuel tank; battery; and electrical system. The author again takes each of these areas and makes recommendations for an ideal truck chassis. 720295. (SP-368) Design Consideration for Mounting a Service Body on a Truck Chassis. H. W. Knapheide, III, Knapheide Mfg. Co. The present lack of chassis uniformity among different makes of trucks forces the service body manufacturer either to produce a greater number of standard models or to modify standard service bodies to fit individual chassis. The problems created by the wide range of cab-to-rear axle lengths for a particular weight truck chassis, for example, could be eliminated by all chassis manufacturers having one common length for each weight class. Other recommendations made include: the elimination of the drop frame chassis and the standardization of frame width and length for a particular weight class chassis. Fuel tank locations are also discussed. 720296. (SP-368) Design Consideration for Mounting a Fire Apparatus Body on a Truck Chassis. Del Bilyeu, Truck Body &amp; Equipment Assn. The problems encountered in mounting fire pumps, fire truck bodies, and related equipment on chassis are discussed. The problem area is defined and recommendations are offered for each of the following areas of the chassis: frame, electrical systems, fuel systems, brake systems, transmission and PTO systems, exhaust systems, drive- lines, and lights. More technical cooperation between body builders and chassis manufacturers is suggested. 720297. (SP-368) Design Considerations for Mounting a School Bus Body on a Truck Chassis. G. L. Hartman, Sheller-Globe Corp. This paper outlines the chassis requirements which enable the school bus body manufacturer to attach his own body successfully to the chassis with a minimum on inter- ference. It describes the cooperative effort made by the major truck chassis and body manufacturers in recognizing problems and formulating objectives for this solution. The areas included in their discussions and formalized in design objectives were: dimensional references, changes made by the body manufacturer, and responsibilities of the chassis manufacturer. Detailed design illustrations are also presented. Finally, the paper describes body attachment, and then discusses problem areas that remain to be solved. 720298. (SP-368) The Problems of Mounting Truck- Mixers on Truck Chassis. William H. Buelow and Earl C. Thayer, Rex Chainbelt Inc. Weight distribution considerations, operational consid- erations, and physical interference problems encountered in mounting concrete truck-mixers on truck chassis are discussed. Trends in mixer size growth and increased acceptance of hydrostatic drive systems are illustrated. A formula for arriving at a truck side-rail "beam" accept- ability index is outlined. 1972 SAE Transactions 720299. (SP-368) Design Consideration for Mounting a Mobile Home Body on a Truck Chassis. R. M. Premo, Sheller-Globe Corp. This paper outlines the design factors that should be considered by the suppliers of chassis for motor homes, and discusses the important considerations involved. The author presents recommendations for the frame, engine mounting, radiator, oil dip stick, automatic transmission, steering column angle and location, brake pedal, exhaust system, gasoline tank, ride quality, and front axle capacity. By working together cooperatively, the mobile home builder and chassis manufacturer can solve many of the problems described.</page><page sequence="46">720300-720306 720300. (SP-368) Problems Confronting a Truck Equip- ment Distributor Mounting Bodies or Equipment on a Chassis. J. Van R. Kelly, Watson Auto- motive Equipment Co. Since almost every new truck is tailor-made, built to the specification of the customer and the commodity it will transport, much cooperation is needed between the chassis manufacturer and the intermediate and final stage manufacturers in completing a truck to optimum stan- dards. This paper makes recommendations for the chassis frame, covering such areas as frame mounting surfaces, chassis frame length, frame strength at front end, and miscellaneous frame considerations. Other problem areas discussed in detail include: cross member interference with PTOs, exhaust systems, clearances for controls, alternators and electrical systems, wiring recommenda- tions, and clearances and locations of other equipment. 720301. Recent Test Data on Selection of Alloy Steels for Gears and Bearings. J. R. Eagan, International Nickel Co. and C. H. Shelton, International Nickel Co. Results of three recent investigations on alloy carburizing, which independently ar- rived at similar conclusions, relate basic inter- pretations of the role of alloy composition, microstructure, and behavior of composite ma- terials to the properties sought. Information on the impact and pitting resistance prop- erties of carburized steels is discussed. Quantitative data on the effect of alloys, heat treatment, and mechanical processing provide assistance to the gear and bearing designer in the more efficient utilization of materials. 1972 SA E Transactions 720302. Converting Conventional Mechanical Stamping Presses to Fabricate Thermoset and Thermo- plastic Sheet Molding Compound. John A. Briggs, Danly Machine Corp. Mold clamping forces are commonly generated by hydraulic, mechanical, or some combination of hydraulic and mechanical methods. The characteristics of vertical hydraulic and mechanical molding machines are discussed and a description of molding two automotive parts in vertical, mechanically driven modified metal working presses is given. Both parts involved were of Fiber Glass Reinforced Plastic (FGRP) material with one part of Thermosetting Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) and the other of a Thermoplastic sheet. The mechanically driven metalworking presses involved were of the type commonly found in automotive stamping plants. 720303. Spectrometric Oil Analysis - Use and Interpre- tation of Data. D. Lo tan, Société Nationale d'Etudes et de Construction de Moteurs d'Avi- ation (France). The paper describes a theory that can be used to explain a mathematical statement of the functioning of an oil system. To arrive at this theory, the rates of contamination of the oil circuits of turbojet engines were investigated extensively, by way of spectrometric oil analyses. The details of the phenomena involved are presented, along with the parameters governing the oil system; a chart for interpreting spectrometric oil analysis data is developed, and the mathematical theory is worked out in detail. There is a relation between the rate of wear of the components of an engine and the rate of contamination of its oil system. By indicating metal particle concentration in the oil, spectrometric oil analysis detects rates of wear high enough to constitute risk of accident due to engine failure. The detection method described takes into account the relation between the rate of contamination and the measured concentration of particles, making it possible to set up contamination rate statistics and to establish component soundness standards. 720304. Civil Certification of a Normal Category Plastic Airplane. Calvin L. Stoner, Federal Aviation Administration. This paper covers structural requirements for certification of a normal category plastic airplane. Due to the lack of service experience and published data, substantiation of the airframe requires special attention. Means for showing compliance with applicable regulations covering proof of structure, fabrication methods, protection of structure, material strength properties and design values, special factors, fatigue strength, and lightning protection are explained. By current standards, a plastic airframe is novel. However, plastics may be the answer to the corrosion and fatigue problems of metal aircraft. 720305. An Investigation of Flight Loads, Counting Methods, and Effects on Estimated Fatigue Life. Richard Sewell, National Research Council of Canada. This paper is concerned with the analysis of aircraft flight loads from counting accelerometer records of normal acceleration at the center of gravity. The load-time histories so obtained may be used to set up applied loads sequences for component or full-scale fatigue tests, and the derived stress-time histories may be used in the estimation of the fatigue life of the wing structure. Accelerometer design is discussed, and three counting methods used (peak-count, variable reset, and level crossings) are compared. Damage calculations are pre- sented, based on the Miner-Palmgren hypothesis of cumulative damage and the stress-endurance data pub- lished by the Royal Aeronautical Society. An alternative to the more-usual method of estimating fatigue damage is given which considerably reduces the labor involved and provides more accurate results. 720306. New Concepts in Developing Flight Airworthiness Requirements. Dennis A. Tuck, Federal Avia- tion Administration. The FAA Flight Test Branch is now actively engaged in 121</page><page sequence="47">720307-720313 122 several regulatory development programs using resources made available by NASA, FAA, USAF, and others in industry. These resources include advanced flight simu- lators, variable stability aircraft, and current aircraft. These tools are in use now to develop standards proposals for supersonic transports, V/STOL transports, and gen- eral aviation aircraft. Critical control and stability parameters may now be explored by FAA flight standards pilots in concert with other government and industry experts to the extent and with fidelity never before possible. An example of this approach may be found in the latest issue of the "Tentative Airworthiness Standards for Supersonic Trans- ports." The SST performance standards therein resulted from an investigation of several aircraft models in the NASA Ames Flight Simulator for Advanced Aircraft and a small delta-winged fighter loaned by the Air Force. 720307. TSO is the Way to Go. Hugh E. Waterman, Federal Aviation Administration. In discussing general aviation equipment standards, the author briefly summarizes some of the steps taken by the FAA in recent years. Several possible vehicles for implementing such standards were investigated by the FAA, and after full consideration, the technical standard order (TSO) system emerged as the best, although imperfect, vehicle. Various objections to TSO are enumerated and discussed, as are the advantages of the system and suggestions for its improvement. 720308. Aspects of Structural Safety in General Aviation Airplanes. Robert Allen, Federal Aviation Ad- ministration; and William Roberts, Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administra- tion. A review of 1547 accidents in general aviation was completed to determine whether structural safety is responsible for a significant portion of these accidents. IFR and turbulent weather conditions existed in more than half these accidents. In fleets with the greatest structural strength, this same result occurred. We con- cluded that the inability to negotiate severe weather suggests aerodynamic improvement may deserve special emphasis. Certain general aviation models were relatively free of one or the other of the two major in-flight failure modes. 720309. Some Special Investigation Areas in Light Air- craft Flutter. Charles C. Pate, Mahendra K. Punatar and Ray W. Winn, Cessna Aircraft Co. A brief description is given of the approach taken by a manufacturer of light business and personal aircraft to the flutter analysis of propeller whirl flutter, twin-boom aircraft, T-tail configuration, servo tabs, and all-moving tail. Effects of structural variations that may occur in the service life of an aircraft are presented, and the effect of ice formation on control surfaces is discussed. 720310. Inspectability Criteria for Airframes Designed to Fatigue/Faile-Safe Requirements. Robert T. Weaver, Federal Aviation Administration. This paper covers inspection programs which will become a part of small airplane certification and operation as a result of Amendment 7 to FAR 23. Amendment 7 adds fatigue evaluation to wings and associated structure, reference paragraph 23.572. Paragraph 23.572 allows two basic methods of pro- viding the required fatigue evaluation: fatigue strength investigation or fail-safe strength investigation. The fail-safe strength investigation allows compliance with the regulations without running long and expensive fatigue analyses and/or tests but must be supplemented with proper inspections for complete FAR 23 compliance. Designing for inspectability and inspection methods will be covered. 720311. Fatigue Certification of General Aviation Aircraft in Australia. K. O'Brien, C. Torkington, M. Benoy and R. Douglas, Dept. of Civil Aviation, Australia. This paper deals broadly with three aspects of the fatigue substantiation of general aviation aircraft structures. It describes the development of the Australian fatigue substantiation requirements for general aviation aircraft; it presents the results of local work in the acquisition of loads spectra for a range of aircraft, including pressurized and nonpressurized light twins, and it discusses some specific problems affecting the safe life and fail-safe substantiation of general aviation aircraft structures. Recent Australian work on ground taxi load spectra and on the endurance and radiographic inspectability of laminated spar caps is described. 1972 SAE Transactions 720312. Reactions of Pilots to Warning Systems for Visual Collision Avoidance. Paul M. Rich, Warren G. Crook, Richard L. Sulzer and Peter R. Hill, Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA conducted a series of six experiments having application to the development of pilot warning instru- ments (PWI). The experiments were concerned with the effect of warning rates on pilot performance, pilot response to imminent collision threats, the evaluation of scanning patterns, the value of warning-only, the effect of relative motion on pilot performance, and the effect of PWI display sector size. The results of these experiments offer a variety of useful data in the area of visual collision avoidance. 1972 SAE Transactions 720313. SECANT - A Solution to the Problem of Mid-Air Collisions. J. L. Parsons, RCA/Government &amp; Commercial Systems. The paper describes the principal characteristics of SECANT, a system for the Separation and Control of Aircraft using Nonsynchronous Techniques. This coop-</page><page sequence="48">720314-720319 erative, transporting collision-avoidance system, de- signed to be compatible within the entire aviation community, is capable of accommodating the dense air traffic anticipated for the 1980s and beyond. It makes available to the pilot evasion or escape maneuvers in any direction - vertical, horizontal, or a combination. SECANT helps the pilot to avoid mid-air collisions by transmitting probes and receiving replies with a 1 fis pulse at 1000 pulses/s on 24 different frequencies. Various discriminants are used to eliminate undesired signal, and the false alarm rate is near zero. The capabilities of each of the following modular equipments are discussed: Remitter, Proximity Warning Indicator, Vicinity Traffic Finder, Collision-Avoidance System, and Traffic Monitoring System. The correlator, which transmits a randomly selected frequency probe and, when a corresponding frequency probe is received, retransmits an appropriate reply, is described. The theory of operation is presented, and development plans are outlined. 1972 SAE Transactions 720314. A Solid-State Altitude Encoder. Dale Pollack, Consultant. An altitude encoder enables an ATC transponder to report the altitude of the airplane to the controller, in addition to its identity and position. Several forms of altitude encoders have been designed. This paper de- scribes a digital altitude encoder with only one moving part, almost zero friction, proper accuracy, and all solid-state components. In this encoder, frequency is the sensing parameter. Also covered are the Gray code and the Gillham code. 720315. Weather Radar for Single Engine Aircraft. A. Rufus Applegarth, Jr., ARADAR Corp. A new approach to airborne weather radar using a simple steerable phased-array antenna is presented. This antenna avoids the need for a dish of any kind and has no mechanical scanning device. It is inexpensive to manu- facture, using microstrip techniques throughout, and has an overall gain that is equal to or better than a dish of comparable size. It is electronically scanned at about 17 frames/s through a 90 deg total angle, producing a TV picture type display. The range, using an 8 kW peak power X-band transmitter and an inexpensive receiver, is greater than 90 miles. The model with beam width about 5 deg in the horizontal plane and 10 deg in the vertical plane fits entirely inside the wing of a Piper Cherokee. A "twin engine airplane" version with an 1 1 in array would have a 5 deg vertical beam width and 6dB of additional loop gain which would permit the transmitter power to be reduced to 2 kW peak power for the 90 mile range. 720316. Flight Evaluations of the Effect of Advanced Control Systems and Displays on the Handling Qualities of a General Aviation Airplane. Paul C. Loschke, Marvin R. Barber, Calvin R. Jarvis and Einar K. Enevoldson, NASA Flight Re- search Center. Flight tests have shown that, by means of improved displays and advanced control systems, it is possible to transform a typical light airplane into a flying machine that borders on being perfect from a handling-qualities standpoint. A flight-director display and an attitude- command control system used in combination trans- formed a vehicle with poor handling qualities during ILS approaches in turbulent air into a vehicle with extremely good handling qualities. The attitude-command control system also improved the ride qualities of the airplane. A rate-command control system was less beneficial than an attitude-command control system. Although this paper deals primarily with general aviation aircraft, the results pertain to other types of aircraft. Short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) aircraft would be a natural application of the control systems because, as a result of their low speeds, they encounter many of the handling-qualities problems noted on light aircraft. The improved ride qualities should be of interest to all airline operations, and for STOL aircraft in particular, because of their prolonged exposure to low-altitude turbulence. 720317. Aileron-Rudder Interconnects and Flying Qual- ities. David R. Ellis, Princeton University. An interconnection between the roll and yaw control may function as a device for coordinating the two controls, or as a means for increasing the effective dihedral, or both. The coordinating function may be interpreted in terms of adjusting the overall level of aileron yaw; this can improve roll and yaw response to roll control inputs. The interconnect function of increasing effective dihedral is of questionable value, and some undesirable side effects might be avoided if it were not employed. 720318. Influence of an Aft C.G. on Longitudinal Flying Qualities. Rogers E. Smith, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. The effects of aft center-of-gravity (eg) travel on the total longitudinal response characteristics of the aircraft are reviewed and the implications of this eg shift on the aircraft's longitudinal flying qualities discussed. In addi- tion, variations in pitch damping, control gearing, and speed effects are discussed at specific aft eg locations. The examples used are based largely on experience gained during in-flight demonstration programs using the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc. (CAL) variable stability B-26 aircraft. 720319. The NASA Advanced Transport Technology Program. Theodore G. Ayers, NASA Langley Research Center. An advanced transport technology program has been 123</page><page sequence="49">720320-720324 124 initiated by NASA to expedite the development and application of advanced technologies to the next gener- ation of subsonic conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) jet transports. The major technical elements of this program include airframe and engine systems studies for identifying technology needs, technology development for providing the technology base in those areas of the aeronautical disciplines offering significant payoffs, and exploratory flight vehicles for validating advanced tech- nology concepts and demonstrating specific benefits associated with civil applications. The possible benefits and application of the NASA-developed supercritical aerodynamic technology are discussed in some detail. Early experimental aerodynamic results obtained from wind-tunnel and flight investigations are included. 720320. Thick-Wing Flight Demonstrations. William E. Palmer and Donald W. Elliott, North American Rockwell Corp. The prime factors in determining overall airplane use- fulness - that is, its range, endurance, and maneuvera- bility, are the aerodynamic, propulsive, and structural efficiencies. Specialists concerned with these disciplines are continually striving to increase the efficiencies in order to provide larger returns on investment, for commercial application, and superiority over opponents in the case of military aircraft. Advances in aerodynamics, with potential for struc- tural weight reductions, are the subject for present consideration. Supercritical aerodynamics, which deals with flow fields where local speeds are greater than the speed of sound, has provided a means whereby cruise flight speeds can be significantly increased to near-sonic conditions or where considerably thicker wings, with the attendant increased useable volume and decreased wing weights, can be utilized without sacrificing cruise speeds. It is this latter case that is the specific subject of the present discussion. To provide proof-of-concept flight data on the thick supercritical wing, the U.S. Navy, NASA, and NR-C have teamed up to conduct a series of flight tests on a modified Navy T2-C Buckeye trainer aircraft. The novel method of airplane modification, generalized qualitative results, and some potential applications are presented in terms that can be appreciated by all engineering backgrounds. 1972 SAE Transactions 720321. Preliminary Results of Some Experiments with a Vortex Augmented Wing. Jan Roskam and Mark Gleason, University of Kansas. A wind tunnel investigation was made of a new high-lift system consisting of a leading edge cusp flap combined with split upper and lower trailing edge flaps. The idea behind the system was to generate two strong spanwise vortices that would increase maximum lift and drag simultaneously. Test results were not encouraging. The spanwise vortices were observed, but were not sufficiently strong to generate the anticipated high lift. Several interesting flow phenomena were observed and are described. The purpose of this paper is to present a summary of results obtained from this wind tunnel test program. 720322. An Energy-Absorbing Seat Design for Light Aircraft. B. Underhill and B. McCullough, Piper Aircraft Corp. Aircraft seats that merely hold the occupants rigidly in place have been satisfactory when considering horizontal or lateral decelerations; but they have not proved sufficient when accidents occur resulting in large vertical deceleration. This deficiency led to the concept of an energy-absorbing seat, which would utilize the space between the seat bottom and the floor to absorb impact energy and reduce accelerations, thereby increasing occupant survival potential. To establish the seat design strength requirements, a maximum tolerance "g" load was chosen, and the maximum vertical velocity was calculated based on the available arresting distance. The effect of varying pas- senger weight was investigated, and a weight was chosen for design purposes. This then defined the load-deflection requirements of the seat. Other requirements established that weight and cost be kept to a minimum, and that conventional materials and fabrication processes be used. The development and static and dynamic testing leading to the final design of a lightweight, economical, energy-absorbing seat are described. 1972 SAE Transactions 720323. Methods of Crashworthiness Testing for Aircraft Design. A. W. Bloedel, Cessna Aircraft Co. The first steps to crashworthiness testing is to design and fabricate instrumentation, design and construct a crash test site for barrier crash testing, and design and fabricate impact sleds for product improvement. Associated with the design phase are many hours of report and paper research pertaining to aircraft crash testing and auto- mobile crash testing. Four basic design concepts apply to crashworthiness of aircraft: production of a structure that will stay intact during a crash; restraint of the occupant during the crash; protection of flailing limbs from injury; and restraint of loose equipment in the cabin. Destruction type tests on full-scale vehicles assure structural integrity of the capsule and provide acceleration pulse shapes of primary structure as collapse occurs in the forward section of the fuselage. 720324. Crash Fire Hazard Evaluation of Jet Fuels. Samuel V. Zinn, Jr., Federal Aviation Admin- istration. A fire hazard evaluation of jet fuels was performed by controlled laboratory test procedures, and the relative ignition characteristics of the fuels were analyzed under simulated survivable aircraft accidents where data pre- viously were inadequate or did not exist. The tests included fuel release modes, ignition sources, and envi-</page><page sequence="50">720325-720334 ronmental conditions which normally occur during a crash. This report presents the details of the work performed, the data obtained, and the conclusions established. 720325. Dynamic Tests of General Aviation Occupant Restraint Systems. Hector Daiutolo, Federal Aviation Administration. A series of twenty-two dynamic tests were conducted on general aviation occupant restraint systems. These tests utilized lap belt, and lap belt/shoulder harness restraint systems. Except for aircraft certified after September 1969, Federal Aviation Regulations require only lap belt restraint systems for emergency landing conditions. Based on the longitudinal deceleration/time response of an- thropomorphic dummy occupants, it was demonstrated that the lap belt/shoulder harness restraint systems offered occupants successful restraint at occupant inertia force levels substantially above the current regulatory level. The tests, preliminary in nature, warranted con- tinuation of the test program in that the lap belt/shoulder harness restraint systems showed promise for regulatory inclusion by virtue of the fact that results were achieved with restraint systems offered as options in recent years, requiring minimal weight increase with fuselage rein- forcement adaptable to retrofit as well as new assembly. 1972 SA E Transactions 720327. Development of the Cessna Model 210 Hydraulic Power Pack. Leon K. Evans, Cessna Aircraft Co. The present power pack used on the Cessna Model 210 is an electrically driven hydraulic unit. This approach in power-pack design combines the advantages of the electric gear system and the hydraulic gear system without reducing the reliability of the total system. The hydraulic system provides light weight and remote location of power units without the use of large pushrods and their related routing problems. This, plus the low cost of electric power units and the deletion of all hydraulic components from the already crowded engine compartment, provides a very substantial improvement to the aircraft landing-gear system. 720328. Unpressurized Navajo Air-Conditioning System. R. C. Eklund, Piper Aircraft Corp. It has been obvious for some time that an air-conditioning system is a desirable option for general aviation aircraft. This paper discusses the more important details of the design and development program for the unpressurized Piper Navajo air conditioning system. The final system weighs 97.6 lb and provides a maximum ground cooling capacity of 18,000 Btu/h on a 100 F day at 1000-1500 engine rpm. Flight testing failed to reveal measurable aircraft performance change with the system off. Since the basic system is closely related to existing automobile systems, emphasis is to be placed on the problems unique to the aircraft installation. 720329. Electric Heating System for Aircraft Applica- tions. James A. Riff, Motorola, Inc. The adaptation of a 3-phase, alternating current, auto- motive modified to produce a-c energies of sufficient magnitude as to provide cabin heating for light commer- cial aircraft is described. Such a system is primarily intended to provide a high degree of reliability, along with the ability to provide continuous controllable heat for long durations. Aircraft heat power sources of this type can be easily constructed, readily installed, and offers simplicity of design for uncompromising safety. 720331. An Improved Stall Warning System for General Aviation Aircraft. Thomas S. Donnelly, Amer- ican Aviation Corp. An improved stall warning system has been developed for general aviation aircraft. Existing stall warning systems are susceptible to false warning signals caused by rough or gusting air. These extraneous warning signals have been eliminated by adding a signal discriminator to the basic stall warning system. The design requires a low-cost, highly repeatable, time-delay module, capable of "zero timing" at each independent actuation of the stall sensor switch. The development of this device is described, and the service test results are discussed. 720333. Pulse Operated, Multichannel Annunciator. R. L. Barnes, Beech Aircraft Corp. Pilots have to read and analyze much flight information. Conditions that require instant action can be instantly recognized by the use of indicator lights. These lights are grouped into annunciator systems, which have changed from simple, single indicator warnings to complex, multichannel systems. These systems provide an analysis of significant conditions of the aircraft and warn of any changes in this condition. This paper discusses the categories of annunciator indicators, circuit requirements, circuit design, additional input circuits, and application. 720334. A Look at V/STOL for Business Aircraft. T. W. Feistel, E. C. Stewart and R. M. Gerdes, Ames Research Center, NASA; and K. R. Smith, Jr., Aerospace Corp. The paper addresses the three questions: "Is V/STOL capability economically viable for business aircraft, and if so how does the viability depend on the aircraft con- cept?"; "How is a V/STOL concept chosen to match a given mission and what are some of the most promising concepts?"; and "What unique operational requirements are likely to be imposed on the users of future V/STOL business aircraft?" A cost-benefit analysis is presented which indicates that a VTOL business aircraft would be more viable economically than a contemporary turbine powered business aircraft. The combinations of traveler's time value and trip distance for which each aircraft dominates is shown. Next, a discussion is presented on the significance of disk loading as it related to V/STOL 125</page><page sequence="51">720335-720341 126 concept application. Preliminary design configuration studies for three different business-aircraft-sized V/STOLs, using three concepts covering a range of disk loading, are presented as examples. Finally, a discussion of operational aspects of interest to future users of V/STOL business aircraft by NASA test pilot with VTOL research aircraft experience is centered around the requirements for routine IFR terminal area operations. 1972 SA E Transactions 720335. Why Another Light Twin Jet: The SN 601 - Corvette. Robert Briot, Société Nationale Indus- trielle Aerospatiale, France. The purpose of this paper is to explain how the following challenging targets have been achieved: large cabin volume with a cruise speed above 400 knots using only limited thrust, short field capability with simple high-lift devices, and versatility with a unique basic version. In each case a carefully balanced choice between several technical solutions was necessary in order to bring on the market a moderately priced aircraft. 720337. Consideration of Application of Currently Avail- able Transport-Category Aerodynamic Technol- ogy in the Optimization of General Aviation Propeller-Driven Twin Design. J. D. Raisbeck, Robertson Aircraft Corp. The evolution of light aircraft design has tended to emphasize payload/range capabilities. A less understood but extremely meaningful area of design, the integration of cruise speed and low-speed flight aerodynamic optimi- zation, is discussed here. High-lift technology has found broad application in large transport aircraft, but virtually none of this tech- nology has been integrated into general aviation aircraft for reasons of cost, complexity of design, lack of low-cost manufacturing adaptability, etc. However, transport- category aerodynamic technology can be applied to general aviation and business aircraft. The application of extensive high-lift devices in conjunction with increased low-speed lift/drag ratio, and advanced airplane control systems to general aviation aircraft is reviewed. Parametric studies of pertinent wing aerodynamic variables were performed for a typical twin-engine propeller aircraft. Wing loading and aspect ratio are optimized for both slow-speed engine-out operation and cruise speed and payload/range. The results are encouraging, and point the way for serious consideration of the integration of advanced technology aerodynamics with propeller-driven twins. Such integration greatly increases these aircrafts' pro- ductivity, efficiency, speed, and safety. 720339. Commercial Applications of Quiet Aircraft Tech- nology. Edward D. Griffith and George F. Roberts, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., Inc. Recent experimental developments in military programs in aircraft quieting are reviewed in this paper, with suggestions on acoustic technology applications appro- priate to general aviation. Comments are offered on the possible impact of developing noise abatement concerns, requirements, and legislation on general aviation. Poten- tially productive design tradeoff studies necessary to ensure minimum cost and an acceptable level of per- formance in the field of commercial light aircraft design are suggested. Reduction in the external acoustic noise signature of light piston-engine aircraft may logically be sought in the area of propulsion system design. 720340. Development of Pseudohomogeneous, Three- Dimensional Continuously Woven Composite Material. T. N. Faddis, G. W. Forman and C. D. Reese, University of Kansas. To overcome the most serious deficiency in fiber- reinforced composite materials a three-dimensional, con- tinuously woven material has been developed. To dem- onstrate the feasibility of the new weave pattern, a 0.3 in thick fabric was woven with 12-end S-glass roving and impregnated with Epon 828 epoxy resin using curing agent Z. A 24 harness semiautomatic loom was used to produce the fabric. Tension tests were conducted on the material in both the weave and transverse directions. The material exhib- ited maximum tensile strength of 47,000 psi and 64,000 psi in the weave and transverse directions, respectively. The elastic moduli were 2,640,000 and 3,220,000 psi, respec- tively. Compression tests were conducted in the weave (longitudinal), transverse, and thickness directions. The ultimate strengths in compression were 39,000, 52,000, and 71,000 psi, respectively. The elastic moduli in compression were 2,820,000, 3,410,000, and 1,240,000 psi in the three respective principal directions. The Poisson ratios were obtained for both tension and compression. 720341. Applications of Hard Anodizing at Cessna. Marvin Hatch, Cessna Aircraft Co. This paper covers the properties of hardcoat anodizing as it applies to changing surface properties of aluminum so it can be used in areas heretofore prohibitive. Information concerning surface preparation, racking, equipment for the process, and post treatments is presented. Hardcoat anodizing changes the surface properties of aluminum so that it can now be used in many new applications. The process employs a refrigerated elec- trolyte maintained below 50 F, vigorous agitation, close control of processing conditions, and a higher current density than conventional anodizing. Specifics about the process at Cessna Aircraft Co. are presented, as is a discussion of racking, surface prepa- ration, and post treatment. The properties of the anodize- coated aluminum and the resultant possible applications are also described.</page><page sequence="52">720343-720347 720343. Fabrication and Analysis of Tetra-Core: A Layered Anisotropic Fiber Composite. F. E. Gordon, G. W. Forman and C. D. Reese, University of Kansas. Tetra-Core is the name given to a fiber composite-material developed by the U. S. Army Aviation Material Labo- ratory, Fort Eus tis, Va. This report discloses the initial studies conducted at the University of Kansas on Tetra-Core, including fabrication methods, analytical strength analyses, and experimental test results. The Tetra-Core composite is formed by stacking oriented, spaced-fiber lamina in a repeating -60, 0, +60 deg pattern. Layers are offset slightly as the stacking occurs, to produce a tetrahedrally shaped element. An improved fabrication loom was conceived and tested. The loom concept is predicated on the fact that the intersection of two planes is a straight line. In the case of Tetra-Core, planes are formed by the buildup of lamina, intersecting to produce tetrahedrally shaped elements. The straight lines formed at these intersections are at an angle of 35 deg 15 min from the vertical. This sloped- wall loom concept provides for more positive fiber placement, higher fiber density, and greater flexibility than afforded by the first methods of Tetra-Core fabrication. This loom concept can be automated to produce either individual panels or a continuous sheet of Tetra-Core. Patent applications have been filed. Tetra-Core is an ortho tropic material that falls into the special category of quasi-isotropic fiber composites. Three strength analyses, based on the macroscopic properties have been conducted: netting analysis, layered anisotropic stringer analysis, and layered anisotropic lamina analysis. Results of all three analyses compare favorably. An experimental test program was conducted to determine the coefficients of the compliance and stiffness matrices. Four elastic properties were measured: Young's modulus in the 1 and 2 directions, in-plane shear modulus in the 1-2 direction, and Poisson's ratio in the 1-2 direction. 1972 SA E Transactions 720344. Corrosion of Adhesive Bonded Clad Aluminum. Narvel Rogers, Bell Helicopter Co. A series of accelerated corrosion tests were conducted to study the relative rates of corrosion penetration into an adhesive bondline on clad and bare aluminum. Three different adhesive systems were tested. Both standard and corrosion-inhibiting primers were used with two of the adhesives. Aluminum alloys, 2024 bare and clad, 7075 bare and clad, 5052 and 3003 were used. The aluminum surfaces were prepared by chromic acid anodizing and by etching in a solution of sulfuric acid and sodium dichromate (FPL etch). The bonded panels were subjected to 30, 60, and 90 days exposure in a salt-spray cabinet. After exposure, the panels were tested for peel strength and were examined visually for extent of corrosion. The results of these tests indicate that the rate of bondline corrosion penetration is greater on the clad aluminum alloys and on 3003 than on the bare alloys tested. 720345. Aircraft Fire Protection Technology Applications. J. G. Alexander, J. H. Newland, D. M. Patterson and F. L. Tempesta, Avco Corp. A different approach to aircraft passenger survival has been undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Avco Corp. - that of shielding the passenger compartment by surrounding it with a fire resistant foam shell capable of protecting the occupants long enough for the fire to burn out, or for fire-fighting equipment to reach the aircraft and extinguish the fire. Application of the newly evolved intumescent material as a passive thermal control system to provide fire protection for remote or inaccessible dry bay regions and equipment bays is also discussed. 1972 SA E Transactions 720346. Purpose of an Aerospace Technology Program. John W. Phillips, Kent State University. Although many of the larger engineering schools tend to specialize in their programs and emphasize graduate school research and development, there exists today a demand for training in basic engineering skills. Since the technology graduate is the general practitioner of engi- neering, the School of Technology assumes particular importance. In the aerospace or aviation industry* the qualified graduate should be able to find employment in the areas of design, manufacturing, or operations. Design includes preliminary layout, stress analysis, test engineering, or materials engineering; manufacturing encompasses qual- ity control, production process, scheduling and planning, liaison and field engineering, or perhaps personnel; and operations includes actual piloting or flight instruction, airport operation and management, aircraft maintenance, and traffic control. The well-planned aerospace technology program is designed to serve the interests of the student and industry in these three general areas. The graduate is not so constrained that he must specialize in any one area, but has sufficient background to enter into, and be competent in, any of them. It is assumed, of course, that on-the-job training is available to develop a maximum competence in any one area. 720347. Growth of Schools of Aeronautical Technology. Leslie L. Thomason, Arizona State University. When technology emerged as a distinct area within the total technology spectrum following World War II, aeronautical technology came into being among 4y degree granting institutions. During the past decade, growth among these programs has been confined to expansion and refinement of existing programs, rather than a quantitative growth in the number of new programs being implemented. The proliferation of technician-oriented 127</page><page sequence="53">720348-720354 128 aeronautical programs among junior colleges came within the past decade. Programs vary from flight training activities provided on a flying club basis to in-depth aeronautical engineering technology curricula. Indiscriminate and universal appli- cation of the term "technology" to all aviation-related programs regardless of content or objective, has led to problems in the transfer of credits. A recommended course of study provides a strong core approach to general studies and technical areas, with numerous options, depending upon the students' specific areas of interest within the framework of aeronautical technology. Facts, findings, and recommendations are based on examination of literature, reports of commissions and committees, and interviews and correspondence with leaders in the aerospace industry and in aeronautical technical education. 720348. What the Aircraft Industry Expects of Recent Graduates in Technoiogy. Paul J. Patterson, Piper Aircraft Corp. A survey was made of 162 engineering supervisors in 54 companies in the aircraft industry to determine to what extent their manpower needs have been filled by tech- nology graduates. This paper reproduces the question- naire, including a tabulation of the responses. The major findings were that such graduates are available, capable, somewhat inflexible, expendable, and promotable only to a point. In discussing the replies to the questionnaire, the author notes that in the present economic climate engineering departments are not operating under normal circumstances. Technologists are available, but are not being hired because of personnel cutbacks. He cites the situation as a challenge to produce a technologist who can provide support for engineering activity as well as adapt to changing job requirements. Areas in which technologists can make significant contributions, namely, design, project engineering, and electronics, are discussed in detail. The limitations of current technologist graduates are also examined. 720349. What the Aircraft Industry Can Do to Assist Technology Schools in Turning Out Graduates for Present and Future Needs. Frank G. Mitchell, Cessna Aircraft Co. This paper explores various ways that the aircraft industry can assist aviation technology schools in turning out graduates who can meet the industry's present and future requirements. Among the methods suggested are: active liaison between industry and schools, making company training materials and programs available to schools, inviting school personnel to seminars and company tours, estab- lishing a network of communications between industry and schools, instituting a variety of cooperative work- study programs, and taking an active part in the training of technical education teachers. 720350. Industry Update of DD A Model T63/250 Turbo- shaft and Turboprop Engine Programs. Elroy P. Neate, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Detroit Diesel Allison (formerly Allison) Division of General Motors has, since 1965, been developing and producing several models of its small model T63/250 gas turbine engine. This paper discusses the continuing engine program by identifying models and applications of both turboshaft helicopter engines and turboprop fixed wing aircraft powerplants. Progress in development of higher horsepower versions which improve the performance and utility of business aircraft is also discussed. 720351. Highlights of the Design and Development of a Modern Geared-Fan Jet Engine. M. C. Steele and F. L. Roberts, AiResearch Manufacturing Co., The Garrett Corp. The Garrett AiResearch Model TFE731-2 two-spool geared-fan jet engine rated at 3500 lb thrust is being developed to fulfill the need for a modern small power- plant in the general aviation marketplace. Rigorous preliminary design cycle optimization studies and the subsequent incorporation of proven component aero- dynamic designs have resulted in an efficient, simple, and compact turbofan engine configuration. Highlights of the performance, mechanical reliability, and ecological aspects of the program are discussed. The engine is currently in the final stages of development with certification scheduled for April 1972. 720352. Development of the JT15D-1 Turbofan Engine. D. L. Cook, United Aircraft of Canada, Ltd. The UACL JT15D-1 engine is a 2200 lb thrust turbofan engine of the high bypass ratio type, the first small engine of the type to be certified and placed in production. The engine is briefly described, and the scope of development testing and resources applied is reviewed. A selection of major development problems is covered, and future developments are indicated. 720354. What is an Engineer? A. F. Campbell, Dawson, Campbell &amp; Associates. The success of any organization or nation is in proportion to the effort exerted by the people involved. To exert full effort, people must be motivated. The more one is motivated, the more effort is expanded. The will and desire to move is enhanced by a motivating stimulus. Man will find his own stimulus, but the organization involved must provide or show that stimuli are available. There is evidence of people apathy slowly creeping into all the professions and we dare not permit this to happen in the engineering profession. This paper offers some suggestions for creating motivating stimulus.</page><page sequence="54">720355-720364 720355. Further Development of Windshields and Wind- shield Mounting. Ulrich W. Seiffert, Christian Hildebrandt and Wolf Nitzsche, Volkswagen- werk AG. The development of windshields and their methods of mounting are covered. By performing tests in which a single head form strikes against the windshield, two model heads strike against the windshield at the same time, and an unrestrained test dummy strikes the windshield, it has been shown that reinforcement of the interlayer and, at the same time, limiting of the windshield edge mounting would improve the safety factor when accidents occur. The necessity of further development is however depen- dent on the restraint system used. Apparently, devel- opment of the windshield is not necessary if inflatable restraint systems are used and if their performance is sufficient enough. 720356. Application of the Parameter Plane Method to the Handling of a Vehicle Under Emergency Conditions. R. R. Guntur, Technical University of Delft, Holland. This paper presents a new approach to the problem of handling a vehicle under emergency conditions, showing that the parameter plane method gives a clearer insight into the handling characteristics of vehicles under emer- gency braking conditions. The value of this method lies in the selection of the two independent parameters. For the particular problem considered, cornering stiffness at the front wheel may be taken as one independent parameter and cornering stiffness at the rear wheel is taken as the other. In other problems, suitable choice of the parameters may be made in order to obtain the necessary infor- mation. An illustrative example is included. The effect of wheel locking on the handling charac- teristics of the vehicle is studied; the degree of instability is redefined as a nondimensional number, and its utility is indicated. If a specified degree of stability is to be achieved, the roots of the characteristic equation of the system must lie within specified boundaries of the complex s-plane. These boundaries may be mapped on the parameter plane. An adaptive brake control system may be designed to confine the movement of the operating point to the region thus specified. 1972 SA E Transactions 720357. Combustion Characteristics of Rotary Engines. K. Yamamoto and T. Muroki, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd.; and T. Kobayakawa, Mazda Motors of America, Inc. An inherent characteristic of the rotary engine geometry is its high surface-to-volume ratio. This results in a high quenching effect at the trailing portion of the charge. Combination of rich mixtures in the end gases together with high quenching effects reduces the octane require- ment. It also means, however, that the unburned hydro- carbon (HC) concentrations are relatively high, whereas the NOx concentrations are quite low. Thermal reactors have been the Toyo Kogyo Co.'s principal approach to the control of CO and HC exhaust emissions. 1972 SA E Transactions 720358. Welding for Strength. H. N. Irvine, Hawkeye Institute of Technology. Modern design trends are placing greater demands on welded structures. This paper discusses the present state of the art and provides recommendations for dealing with some of the more commonly encountered structural problems. Emphasis if placed on stress concentration and fatigue strength and the relation of these factors to welding practices and methods. Formulas needed to compute stress and strength are presented. Characteristics of various types of materials, of fillet size, and of good bonding welds are described and compared. 720359. The Engineer as a World Competitor. R. G. Brown, Eaton Corp. The role of the engineer, the engineering profession, and professional societies such as the SAE are discussed against a backdrop of domestic and international trade. Questions are posed regarding individual responsibility and future shock handling. 720361. Design to Minimize Stress Concentration. Socrates Rombakis, John Deere Waterloo Trac- tor Works. The importance of the stress concentration factor in design of structures is emphasized. Design for static stress concentration and design for fatigue stress concentration with ductile and brittle materials has been described. Changes, in the critical areas to minimize stress concentration, and examples with typical cases of critical areas of discontinuities are given. Table with design techniques for improving fatigue strength and a few stress concentration charts have been enclosed which are typical in the construction. 720363. Urban Transport Development: Prospects for Implementation. C. William Hamilton, Battelle Columbus Labs. The record of the nation's cities in implementing plans for significant changes in their public transportation systems is strikingly poor. However, there is substantial evidence to suggest that all the important pieces necessary for major programs are available. This paper covers forces of change in urban transport development - sources of financing, institutional arrangements and their impact on decisionmaking; also discussed is urban transportation technology - options for the future, and transit imple- mentation projects in cities. 720364. FAA Participation in Airport Construction. John H. Shaffer, Federal Aviation Administration.

The Act authorized a $5.4 billion federal expen- diture for improvements to the National Aviation System during the decade of the Seventies. The Airport Devel- opment Aid Program (ADAP) portion of the Act projects a $2.5 billion expenditure to match state and local funds for the improvement of existing airport facilities and to construct new airports. This paper describes the gov- ernment's participation through the Federal Aviation Administration in airport construction. 720365. Gylon Fluorocarbons: New High-Performance Friction Materials for High-Speed, Heavy-Duty Wet Clutches. Walter R. Wise, Jr. and Jerry R. Mitchell, Garlock Inc. Gylon® is a proprietary family of filled fluorocarbons that are the new, high-speed, high-performance friction mate- rials of now and the future. The energy absorption, life, and power transmission capabilities it contributes to heavy-duty, wet clutches in both over-the-road and off-the-road vehicles have been demonstrated to be markedly superior to those of metallic and semimetallic friction materials currently available. Gylon friction material is providing substantive commercial solutions for current problem clutches as well as for new-generation, high-speed clutches now on the the drawing board. 720366. Evaluation of Friction Materials. A. B. Olson, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The evaluation of new friction materials at Caterpillar includes small scale, full scale, and field tests. These tests and the equipment used for them are discussed, as well as the philosophy behind the program. The quality assurance of production materials, the equipment used, and the tests run are directed at measuring the performance of incoming materials to be sure they meet our standards. New tools being developed to improve the program are described. 720367. Obtaining and Utilizing Recorded Data for Vehicle Development. B. C. Zehr, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Demands for quick, sure answers to field problems; shorter development times; an ever-increasing amount of social and political pressures; and increasing foreign competition present a tremendous challenge to construc- tion equipment engineers. To meet this challenge, we must economize by more fully and effectively using developed technology. One area where considerable improvement can be made is in obtaining and utilizing recorded instrumented data. This paper first discusses the types of instrumentation that are being used to record data; then gives practical examples of how the data can be used in establishing loadings for full-scale structural fatigue testing and ^ laboratory component testing, or in establishing test courses for complete vehicles. Emphasis is placed on the team effort required to obtain, analyze, and use recorded data successfully for vehicle development. 720368. Computer Aids for Analysis of Recorded Data. George W. Melton, Caterpillar Tractor Co. During design, development, and testing, the engineer is continually confronted with the task of transforming a large volume of freshly gathered, undigested data into a meaningful representation of "what's going on." This paper discusses several types of analyses that have proved to be both useful and flexible. The necessary data processing tools, also described, vary in complexity from a desk calculator system to a large computer system. 1972 SA E Transactions 720369.

Scheduled Oil Sampling as a Maintenance Tool. R. L. Klug, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Analysis of used lubricating oil for products of wear can indicate the mechnical condition of engines, transmission, final drives, and hydraulic systems. Laboratory equipment is available and techniques have been developed which allow the servicing dealer to perform this analysis in the field. Test results can also be interpreted by the servicing dealer. The time lag between sampling and reporting is reduced, and the servicing dealer can utilize guide lines available from the manufacturer while taking full advan- tage of familiarity with machine history and local operating conditions. Maximum results are achieved only when sampling is done on a continuing basis. 1 972 SAE Transactions 720373. A User's Experience with Oil Analysis. Max F. Oelschlaeger, Concrete Materials Div., Martin Marietta Corp. Oil analysis is a maintenance tool that shows great promise in the construction and aggregate industries. Properly administered, it can save the user much money through maintenance costs and improved machine avail- ability.</page><page sequence="56">720374-720379 The paper describes an analysis problem based on the reporting of periodic samplings taken in order to deter- mine the presence of contaminants in the lubricants of various compartments of heavy-duty equipment. Loca- tions of excessive wear can also be identified. When the oil sample program is operational, a monitor maintenance program serves to let the customer recognize and treat minor problems before they become major problems. Preliminary statistics are cited, indicating the new program's performance to date, and difficulties encoun- tered are noted. 720374. The WABCO 150-Ton Electric Truck - Facts and Features. William Zorn, Westinghouse Air Brake Co. The WABCO Model of 150-B mining truck was an- nounced in late 1970, and during 1971, over 40 of them were delivered to various customers in this hemisphere. It employs various powerplants up to 1600 hp, which gives it a very favorable horsepower-to-weight ratio for vehicles in this size category. The 36 X 5 1 in tires provided are more than adequate for this vehicle, as the low air pressure at which these tires can be operated minimizes tire failures from road obstructions and provides extremely long life. The d-c drive system recently developed by General Electric for vehicles of this size class utilizes operational principles and design features that were successfully employed in smaller drive systems of this type, currently installed in over 1300 vehicles with engines up to 1000 hp. This paper describes the features of construction of this vehicle and the unique attributes of the pneumatic and hydraulic system. 720375. Euclid Turbine-Electric Rear Dump. Douglas M. Kelley, White Motor Corp. The need for a compact, lightweight rear dump truck of large capacity has generated a new concept in the 200 ton class truck market. The dimensions of the load-carrying body and tires for the given capacity were set forth at the basic parameters inside of which the structure of the truck was to be accommodated. Recent development of an exceptionally small 7,500 lb, 1850 hp, gas turbine-alternator package permits ideal amidship installation of the powerplant. Dual tires on the front and rear axles gives low body loading height and 50-50 weight distribution, both empty and loaded. Electric motors allow simple, convenient drive to all wheels for 100% traction capability in propulsion and dynamic braking. 720376. Vcon 3006 - A New Concept in Large Mining Trucks. Leo Davis, Peerless Manufacturing. The world's largest mining end dump truck, the Vcon 3006, utilizes several new innovations to raise vehicle performance limitations and to increase the productivity per operating cost. Its capability of hauling 250 tons on eight 36.00 X 51 tires with equal load distribution and reduced load variations at increased ton mile per hour values is provided by a walking beam frame and four independently suspended oscillating bogies on liquid spring suspension units. Individually powered wheels with single tires provide exceptional traction and reduce tire scrubbing in turns to a minimum. Its 3000 hp diesel locomotive engine provides a low fuel consumption, high performance, and reliability unmatched for a vehicle in this class. The Vcon 3006 design concept provides it flexibility to match power requirements to the job and provides for potential future trolley applications. 720377. How Does a Manager Motivate Engineers? M. G. Tiede, Deere &amp; Co. Engineering resources comprise one of the most vital assets of any enterprise. With technical change so rapid, engineers become unproductive and disgruntled early in their careers. Helping them to develop themselves into enthusiastic, productive career achievers instead of just job-holders is the art of motivating people. The most valuable resource a manager of an engineer controls to achieve this self-actualization of his career is himself. This paper discusses the qualities a good engineering manager should possess himself, and a number of techniques he should use to motivate his engineers. 720378. Japanese Approach to Motivation. E. W. Snell, Caterpillar Tractor Co. This paper identifies some of the motivational charac- teristics inherent in Japanese culture. Much of Japan's strength today is derived from the diligence and dedi- cation of its people to their country, companies, and families. The Japanese have effectively combined their above-average literacy with hard work to mold a work force that produces enormous quantities of products at high production rates. Rather than perpetuate their image as imitators the Japanese today are emerging as an innovative people determined to establish their nation as an industrial leader. Some insights into the reasons for this determination are presented here. The author became a student of the Japanese way of life during six years of living in Japan while working for Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. The material is based upon personal observations and discussions with the Japanese and noted authorities including Howard VanZandt, vice president, ITT Far East, and Pacific Inc. 1972 SA E Transactions 720379. How to Manage for Good Motivation Results. Robert B. Singer, White Motor Corp. Managing and supervising to achieve favorable results in motivating engineering employees is related to the planning, budgeting, and administration practices recom- mended for a product engineering activity within a corporation environment. The information and sugges- tions included in this paper are based upon 23 years of experience and have produced favorable results. Other material in the paper is considered valuable in avoiding 131</page><page sequence="57">720380-720387 132 negative results in motivation. The paper concludes with specific suggestions for supervisors and managers of engineering employees. 720380. Serviceability in Development and Design to Support Maintenance and Operation. Lewis L. Gober, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Re- search &amp; Development Command. For many years, design engineers have considered their duties finished when the design was finished, leaving all maintenance problems to the operator/mechanic. Pres- ently, however, the operator/mechanic sees no relevancy in the work left to him to perform. This paper suggests ways to deal with the problems resulted from this situation and recommends many solutions, including an SAE serviceability panel. 720382. Effective Utilization of Horsepower in the Mined-Land Reclamation Effort. John W. Howland, The Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. The growing national concern for preservation of the environment presents a real and difficult challenge to the mining industry and manufacturers of earthmoving equipment. Perhaps the greatest challenge is the devel- opment of equipment that will relocate strip-mined spoil with a greater degree of efficiency than is presently possible with conventional bulldozers. The relatively short distance that spoil must normally be relocated is a guideline for research and development of techniques and attachments for conventional bulldozers, designed spe- cifically to handle large volumes of spoil over lateral distances of 50 ft or less. Although a wide variety of standard and exotic approaches have been considered for handling spoil in the land reclamation effort, the tractor appears to be the most suitable basic prime mover; the angle blade shows promise as an attachment that can materially improve overall efficiency in short relocation distance ranges where bulldozing techniques are highly inefficient. 720383. Why Our Landfill Equipment Needs are Dif- ferent. George Edema, Browning Ferris Indus- tries. Waste disposal is no longer a simple matter of finding landfill areas and dumping in the refuse cast off by the public and industry. As this paper emphasizes, landfill must be considered as salvageable real estate useful for later development. This requires specialized techniques and specialized machinery, all of which have identifiable needs that are unlike those of the usual earthmoving operations. How much these needs differ and how they can be satisfied by design changes to produce efficient machines capable of handling continuous, all-weather landfill programs are highlighted. The urgency of finding ways to handle an ever increasing burden of trash and waste is a compelling reason for solving the problems of this industry. 720384. Sanitary Landfill - Boom or Doom? Richard W. Eldredge, Roy F. Weston, Inc. In the field of solid waste management, the earthmoving industry has particular interest in all regulatory actions concerning the disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills. Recent passage of Public Law 89-272, the Solid Waste Act of 1965, and Public Law 91-512, the Resource Recovery Act of 1970, has produced for the earthmoving industry a feeling of uncertainty with respect to the future. Opposing viewpoints are presented, and a prediction is made based on logical assumptions. 720385. Servo Controller for Fatigue Testing Full-Scale Structures. R. G. Miller, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The Servo Controller is basically a closed-loop device capable of producing and applying a program of multiple time-varying forces to a test specimen. It was developed as a universal tool to fatigue test full-scale specimens in the laboratory. An electrohydraulic servovalve is utilized as a controlling mechanism. This paper reviews the design and development of the system and discusses some of its application. 720386. Automatic Laser Grade Controls. Ted L. Teach, Laserplane Corp. The development of the continuous gas laser has made possible a new method of automatic grade controls for construction equipment. This method of control has advantages offered by no other system: accuracy, reduced operator skill requirements, reduced direct labor costs, and night operation. Developed originally for draintube plow and motor grader control, laser grade control systems now control various machines, such as ditchers, scrapers, landplanes, dozers, and trimmers. Several manufacturers now offer automatic laser grade controls as original factory equip- ment. Laser controls offered on the market to date are limited to operation in planes. Equipment to control both vertical and horizontal curves is presently under devel- opment for machines such as trimmers and pavers. With such controls, it will be possible to generate very complex surfaces with accuracies not now possible. 720387. Design and Development of the Funk 1000 Transmission. J. J. Jameson, Funk Manufac- turing Co. Some of the design decisions made in the Funk 1000 transmission are reviewed in this paper. The gear and shafting arrangement and clutch shaft are described, and power flow is detailed. The design of the torque converter to accommodate both an automotive and industrial converter is explained, as are the operation of the hydraulic circuit and clutch construction. Gear and bearing life is considered, and developmental testing to evaluate performance and reliability is reported.</page><page sequence="58">720388-720407 720388. Off - Highway Haulage Truck Powerplants - Diesel Engine and Gas Turbine Experience. D. C. Myntti, Kennecott Copper Corp. This paper reviews the experience of operating six gas turbine powered haulage trucks at the world's largest open pit mine. It compares the actual findings with the claimed advantages and disadvantages of operating gas turbine engines. Although the turbines have been replaced with diesel engines, the prospect of turbines in haulage trucks still shows promise. 720389. Deflection Characteristics of a Statically Loaded Multiple-Bearing Differential Pinion Shaft. M. M. Delao, E. E. Pfaffenberger and W. J. Derner, Link-Belt Bearing Div., FMC Corp. Theoretical and experimental determinations of load and deflection at the spigot bearing position were performed on a straddle-mounted (3-bearing) differential pinion shaft in a complete truck differential and carrier assembly. Two theoretical calculation methods are used; namely, a widely used approximate method that considers the shaft to be supported by two bearings and a digital computer method that treats the shaft as a statically indeterminate structure. Loads on the spigot bearing were measured using the Contact Pattern Analysis technique, while deflections were measured with strain gage displacement transducers, all under a statically applied input torque. Comparison of theoretical and experimental results show that the actual loads are more consistent with a 3-bearing statically indeterminate system calculation than with a simplified 2-bearing theoretical approach. Further re- finement of the elastic model of the bearings is suggested to provide even closer agreement. 720390. The Churchill Falls Power Development Man- agement and Construction Equipment. H. L. Snyder and R. D. Boivin, Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corp. Ltd. In this paper the Churchill Falls power development is briefly described. However, particular emphasis is placed on construction management and the types of heavy construction equipment required. The scope of each of the four major divisions into which construction at the project has been divided, that is, storage, power, transmission and support facilities, is outlined. The basic performance data of the equipment used in each facility are listed. 720402. (SP-369) Acoustic Fundamentals and Noise. John B. Miller, University of Wisconsin. Acoustic noise has been described as "sound without value." This paper on acoustic noise is a study of what is called sound, treating of how it is generated, how it is propagated, absorbed, and measured. These specifics are discussed, along with some simple examples of how sound is related to the environment in which it exists. 720403. (SP-369) Methods of Vehicle Noise Measure- ment. Ralph K. Hillquist, General Motors Proving Ground. This paper discusses the various vehicle noise test procedures promulgated by SAE, ISO, and ANSI; it notes some shortcomings of these documents and presents suggestions for improving them. The goal is to make these vehicle procedures more representative of typical oper- ating modes and community exposure problems. 720404. (SP-369) Noise Legislation, Present and Future, as Related to Product Design. R. H. Lincoln, Outboard Marine Corp. The current and future regulation of product noise levels required by federal, state, and local authority has been surveyed. Probable effects on product design are pre- sented and discussed, with consideration given to specific problems such as: cost/benefit; enforcement, noise- monitoring networks; lead time; technological feasibility; and design concept changes. All these problems are present and must be considered in any coordinated approach to product noise control. 1972 SAE Transactions 720405. (SP-369) The Abatement of Structural Noise in Internal Combustion Engines. Richard D. Strunk, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. The mechanism of structural noise in internal combustion engines is defined, and its abatement is considered. Structural noise is shown to dominate the other sources of engine noise at high frequencies. The abatement of engine structural noise by employing the fundamentals of isolating high-frequency vibrations, reducing the radiation efficiency of finite panels, and damping resonant vibra- tions is discussed. 720406. (SP-369) Practical Noise Control for Engines. Lyle F. Yerges, Lyle F. Yerges, Consulting Engineers. Engine noise control involves well-known methods and procedures, and the methods applied successfully to automotive situations can be applied with equal success to nonautomotive equipment. Three case histories are given in which a problem is solved with existing standard equipment by exerting control at the source, along the transmission path, and to the receiver. 720407. Air Cushion Restraint Systems Development and Vehicle Application. D. D. Campbell, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. The discussion presented in this paper includes: A design review of General Motors air cushion restraint system, performance in dynamic testing, and the General Motors program for production build and fleet tryout. Among the items covered in the design review are: The driver's restraint system, the front passenger's restraint system, and the sensing mechanism. The discussion of air cushion system performance testing includes: The text matrix, two significant crash configurations, the importance of vari- able inflation levels, and the need to continue baboon and human volunteer testing. The discussion of the General 133</page><page sequence="59">720408-720413 134 Motors pilot production build and fleet tryout program covers the purpose for gaining "on-road" air cushion system experience. 720408. Air Cushion Systems for Full-Sized Cars. J. A. Pflug, Ford Motor Co. The initial air cushion research by Ford and suppliers has primarily involved full-sized cars. Technical approaches for these cars in packaging, kinematics, sensing and deployment are presented. Also, efforts to meet the requirements of the potential restraint standard as well as to resolve "real world" problems are discussed. 720409. Development Problems with Inflatable Restraints in Small Passenger Vehicles. Ulrich W. Seiffert and Gunnar H. Borenius, Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). This paper summarizes the work done on air bag systems under Volkswagen's restraint system development pro- gram. The paper first presents theoretical considerations as applied to small cars. Based on this, some typical design parameters for the Volkswagen air bag systems are given. Sensor considerations and various air bag system concepts and configurations are discussed. The solutions chosen for the VW are presented, followed by some typical test data from sled tests and full-scale crash tests. Acceptable small-car systems cannot be expected simply by scaling down large car systems, mainly because of the differences in vehicle deceleration characteristics and passenger compartment layout between large and small cars. Volkswagen's development experience over the last few years has shown that, before solving all the peripheral problems of inflatable restraints which are not covered by FMVSS 208, an extensive development effort is required to reach the basic 30 mph performance levels attained by large car air bag systems one or two years ago. In summary, the advantages and disadvantages of the air bag system are described. These indicate that the air bag is not clearly superior to other restraints, and Volkswagen believes that the customer should be allowed to select the type of restraint system for his vehicle. 720410. French Developments in Original Déployable Systems (With Reference to Safety Belts). C. Tarriere, Association Peugeot-Renault; G. Mauron, Research Dept. Peugeot; and P. Ventre, Renault. The Association Peugeot-Renault has explored several paths, technological as well as theoretical, regarding déployable methods of restraint. The first work was carried out using various kinds of American-made devices. At the same time, the Association Peugeot- Renault is actively participating in the development of French devices. This communication explains the present stage of these technological solutions, analyzes the performances obtained, and allows comparison of the latter with those obtained using seat belts. 720411. Special Problems and Considerations in the Development of Air Cushion Restraint Systems. E. H. Klove, Jr., Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp.; and Robert N. Oglesby, Engi- neering Staff, General Motors Corp. Presented in this paper is a discussion of the details of the General Motors air cushion restraint system and of specific technical problems of system development and of implementing a production build program. The details of the General Motors system include a description of the components of the driver's and front passenger's systems, crash sensing, and "variable inflation." The discussion of specific technical problems includes performance con- siderations, such as: Occupant rebound, child-size oc- cupants, out-of-position occupants, nonbarrier type crashes, and the function of the appearance cover. Also included is a discussion of the toxicity potential, noise risk, sensor development, reliability considerations, and field service requirements. 720412. Requirements for Air Bag Restraint Energy Sources. Robert J. Hayosh and A. L. Gutherie, Ford Motor Co. One of the subsystems of air bag passive restraint systems presently under examination for automotive application is the energy source subsystem. The function of the energy source is to provide, release, and control a volume of gas at a rapid rate to inflate the air bag. Three basic types of energy sources will be described: stored gas, generated gas, and hybrid sources. Both liquid-cooled and gas- cooled hybrid sources are mentioned. The automotive requirements for application of energy sources are discussed in terms of performance objectives for passive restraints, particularly for front seat passenger air bags. The requirements include minimum package size and weight, ability to perform in hot and cold as well as normal environments, freedom from degradation during the service life, high reliability, controlled toxicity and heat, and ability for safe disposal during vehicle recycling. Two new types of inflation systems which are to improve versatility are mentioned. These systems are to provide either secondary inflations or multiply deployment speeds depending on their design. 720413. Gas Generator and Aspirator for Automatic Occupant Restraint Systems. Foy McCullough, Jr., William F. Thorn, L. Bruce Katter and Eckart W. Schmidt, Rocket Research Corp. Development of reliable, low-cost inflators without toxic exhaust products is the key to successful inflatable occupant restraint systems. The characteristics and per- formance of gas generators and aspirator inflators are presented together with cushion gas characteristics. Toxicity considerations, including both gaseous and aerosol constituents, are discussed. Results indicate that inflators can be produced that will meet stringent, yet realistic, toxicity requirements. The fasibility of the aspirator inflator has been established, and this unique</page><page sequence="60">720415-720421 device offers distinct and significant advantages over conventional direct inflation devices. 1972 SA E Transactions 720415. Gas Cushion Systems Analysis - Occupant-Cush- ion Interactions. B. K. Hamilton, Craig Young, Claude P. Talley, K. Chakravarti, David E. Finlow and William H. Wright, Fibers Div., Allied Chemical Corp. A simplified approach for analytically obtaining equations of motion for torsos, during contact with gas cushions in frontal collisions and subsequent ride-down character- istics has been developed. From these equations, calcu- lation of torso "g" forces, cushion pressures, and other system parameters can be made. Comparison of calcu- lated values and those obtained, experimentally, are in good agreement. Utilizing this approach, it appears possible to optimize gas cushion system parameters in terms of desired torso response under a variety of design criteria as a guide to system design and experimental verification. Such parameters include cushion configu- ration, fabric permeability, and temperature, type, and quantity of gas introduced before and during torso impact. 1972 SA E Transactions 720416. The Anatomy of an Inflator for Air Cushion Occupant Systems. Ronald C. Lawwill, Olin Corp. Many anxieties have been generated concerning the introduction of an air cushion passive restraint system in automobiles for a variety of reasons; but, one of the most prevalent anxieties stems from the common lack of understanding relative to the functioning characteristics and safety of the inflator which is to contain some quantity of pyrotechnic materials - this inflator becoming a permanent fixture in the passenger compartment of the vehicle. This presentation discusses in understandable detail the physical and functional characteristics of the basic pyrotechnically augmented inflator and how each of its major components contribute to form a controllable system which can be varied to meet various systems demands. It further discusses a proposed marriage of inflator and sensor in a system totally restricted from functioning by any other mode than the properly pre- scribed crash energy signature. 720417. Compact, All-Solid Gas Generators. George A. Lane, Thomas E. Dergazarian and Gerald R. Staudacher, The Dow Chemical Co. Gas generators for filling auto air cushions have been developed in several compact sizes and configurations. All solid chemical-generating compositions have been devel- oped to give nearly pure nitrogen gas. Other compositions developed give mainly carbon dioxide. Gas cushions ranging in size from 1-12 ft3 have been inflated. De- ployment time, bag temperature, and sound level are within safe limits. Toxicity tests have been performed on dogs without harmful effects being observed. 720418. Energy Management in IORS. W. R. Carey, T. J. Wissing, R. G. Gehrig, G. W. Goetz and D. A. Larson, Safety Systems Div., Eaton Corp. Inflatable Occupant Restraint Systems (IORS) are catego- rized according to high, medium and low momentum air bag deployment energies. Theoretical flow curves for these categories are presented which minimize deployment accelerations imparted to out of position occupants, in particular the standing child. Practical techniques to achieve these flow curves for stored gas, augmented gas and solid inflators are presented. Aspirating systems are described and their superiority over direct fill systems is indicated. 1972 SA E Transactions 720419. Crash Sensor Basic Requirements. Trevor O. Jones and Oliver T. McCarter, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. The primary purpose of this paper is to suggest basic crash sensor requirements which can serve as a basis of further discussion. No attempt has been made in the body of this paper to suggest a particular crash sensor scheme or to recommend specific detectors or devices. However, an Appendix is provided in which is described the current General Motors sensor scheme. As air cushion systems are developed and evaluated, it becomes more apparent that the crash sensor is, perhaps, the most vital system component. In view of the criticality of this system component, a suggested comparative analysis of crash sensor has been included. 1972 SA E Transactions 720420. Crash Sensors for Inflatable Occupant Restraint Systems. E. Pujdowski, Safety Systems Div., Eaton Corp. Several Inflatable Occupant Restraint Systems (IORS) crash sensors are compared with respect to operating principle, performance, and potential vehicular use. Desirable characteristics of the sensor mount are de- scribed. Forward mounted crash sensors are discussed as a means of providing early crash discrimination. Rough road and barrier test results with crash sensors are reviewed. 720421. Crash Detector Development. Lon E. Bell, Allied Chemical Corp., Technar, Inc. Within the past several years many crash detector concepts have been evaluated for use in automobiles. The experience gained in the process of detector development has lead to several useful new design techniques. In this paper, under the general categories of design methods and design verification procedures, special applications of failure mode analysis, design perturbation analysis, and inadvertent actuation prediction techniques are discussed. The design of rolamite acceleration-time detectors and the 135</page><page sequence="61">720422-720428 136 concept of fail safe and self-diagnostic design are presented as applications of specific methods. 720422. Development of a Radar Sensor for Inflatable Occupant Restraint System. Takayuki Makino, and Dazuo Sato, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes a radar sensor which is being developed as an adequate sensor for an inflatable occupant restraint system. The important characteristic of this radar sensor is that an optimum highly sensitive sensing zone is formed by the combination of two transmission antennas and two reception antennas in order to improve the collision judgment accuracy, mini- mize the difference of precollision time for various obstacles, and suppress the received signal level due to rain and snow, etc. 720423. A Microwave Anticipatory Crash Sensor for Automobiles. John B. Hopkins, F. Ross Holmstrom, Morrin E. Hazel, Edward White and Timothy Newfell, U. S. Department of Transportation. An anticipatory crash sensor for actuation of déployable passive restraint systems has been developed. The system consists of a 10 GHz continuous wave (CW) doppler radar. In operation, position discrimination is achieved through use of separate receiving and transmitting antennas, located on opposite sides of the front of the vehicle. An object is detected only when within the region of overlap of the two antenna patterns. Velocity dis- crimination has been achieved very simply in both digital and linear realizations. A threshold circuit permits adjustment of the minimum target size to which the sensor will respond. A variety of circuit and antenna configurations has been examined and constructed to obtain optimal system performance. These include hybrid systems which make use of mechanical confirmation of impact in an inter- mediate speed range, and more elaborate antenna con- figurations. Characteristics of typical targets have been determined experimentally. In addition, studies have been carried out to permit preliminary estimates of cost and reliability for production sensors, and - using available accident data - to indicate the probable effectiveness of such systems. 1972 SA E Transactions 720424. A Critical Review of Radar as a Predictive Crash Sensor. Trevor O. Jones, Dale M. Grimes and Ronald A. Dork, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. A general discussion will be provided on crash sensor requirements with emphasis on the advantages of long inflation times. Several different "text book" varieties of candidate radar systems will be described. An information and data processing analysis will be conducted relative to crash sensor required information. The conclusion reached is that radar crash sensors will be unavailable for model year 1976 air cushion requirements. 1972 SA E Transactions 720425. Development of the Crash Sensor/Vehicle Inter- face. Keith B. Termaat and Kenneth A. Free- man, Ford Motor Co. Crash sensor interfacing with the automobile must be approached from the occupant protection standpoint. Generation of the crash pulse, which determines occupant response, is affected by complex vehicle variables that often preclude discrimination from noncrash signals. Synthesis of the design solution is approached on a systems basis to match sensor capability to vehicle variables. Reliability is provided for with appropriate design of experiments and statistical analysis. 1972 SA E Transactions 720426. A Basic Airbag Model. Donald J. Nefske, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A mathematical simulation of the operation of a com- pressed-gas airbag system is developed. A system was built and tested, and the analysis is evaluated on the basis of these tests. Included in the study are nonideal gas effects, manifold and diffuser effects, bag stretch, bag leakage, and overpressurization of the passenger com- partment. Interaction between a single rigid object and the bag is also considered. A correlation between bag pressure and the force it generates is obtained. This allows the development of an analytic model for determining the motion of a single rigid mass interacting with a dynam- ically inflating airbag mounted in a moving vehicle. An application of the model to study rebound of the occupant from the airbag is presented. 720427. A Consumer Case for the Air Bag and the Problem of Public Acceptance. Lowell Dodge, Center for Auto Safety. Impositions placed on vehicle occupants by safety belts and safety belt use are substantial and will increase as systems to encourage or force belt usage are incorporated. By comparison, the known impositions of air bags are minor, but to these must be added other requirements, the extent of which are not yet well-known. Substantial fleet testing of air bags will clarify most of these inconven- iences. Automobile manufacturers and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have failed to generate public support for the air bag. Lack of consumer support will continue unless greater resources are allo- cated to equip fleet vehicles with air bag systems so that a reliable record of air bag efficacy can be compiled. 720428. Consumer Acceptance of the Volvo Passive Belt System. Nils Bohlin and Stig Pilhall, AB Volvo (Sweden). Consumers' acceptance of and attitude toward a passive three-point belt system have been studied and evaluated</page><page sequence="62">720429-720433 in a personal interview investigation of 325 people. These participants were provided with the opportunity to try out the belt system in two demonstration cars - 2-door and 4-door sedans. The method of selecting the respondents complied very well with the requirements of public representation. The results of the inquiry are presented in the full survey as related to driver, passenger, age, sex, etc. The main questions in the study - the convenience when entering or leaving the demonstration car - was very positively judged. The most frequent opinion on a 7-point evaluation scale was as high as 7 (most positive); the average value of 6.2-5.9 was given for wide and half-open doors, respectively. 720429. A Consumer Viewpoint on Car Restraint Sys- tems. Leonard R. Barnes, Michigan AAA Motor News. Lap-shoulder belts became standard with very little, very ineffective explanation of why they should be used. National effort is needed to persuade all to use them and automobile industry to improve them, and to see the effect of buzzers and interlocks before mandating airbags or equivalent. This paper looks at the past history of restraints, forecasts the future if airbags are to be mandated without explaining them. AAA of Michigan motorist survey shows strong dislike of airbags, a preference for seatbelt-shoulder harness if choice must be made, a strong feeling that it is not the business of government to mandate airbag or seatbelt use. A question is raised about claims of number of lives that airbags will save. Are they too high? 1972 SAE Transactions 720430. Passenger Car Occupant Restraint Alternatives Demonstration and Display: A Consumer Re- search Study. Robert S. Baxter, Chrysler Corp. The main objectives of the survey were to obtain consumer reaction to and preferences for various occu- pant restraints based upon perceptions of performance, convenience, and overall usefulness. Specific cost factors were to be excluded. Two of the restraint alternatives were under active consideration by Chrysler Corp.: a "cushion system" and "semi-automatic" or continuous belt ar- rangement. The research was designed to determine whether or not further development was warranted. Respondents' restraint preferences in their next new car were taken three times. Latent preferences were obtained prior to any exhibit exposure at the beginning of the survey. Preferences were next obtained immediately after the filmed demonstrations. Final preferences were obtained following the vehicle inspections and demon- stration. In the initial preferences, only 40% of the respondents indicated a preference for seat belts. Some 19% of the respondents stated a preference for inflatable air bags and 27% gave a preference for extra, crushable foam-filled panels. These preferences shifted to 82% for seat belts, 5% for air bags and 11% for extra, crushable panels after the filmed performance demonstrations. Inflatable air bags were last choice for 69%. Final preferences following the vehicle inspections were similar, with a slight shift toward extra, crushable panels and away from air bags. Among the 83% preferring seat belts, better than four out of five wanted both lap and shoulder belts. A minority of 22% preferred the contin- uous lap belts over the self-locking retractor lap belts. 720431. The Air Bag Controversy - A Case of Over- inflation of Underinflation? Donald L. Schaffer, Allstate Insurance Co. The air bag is ready and installation in front seat positions is essential at the earliest possible date. There has been almost a conspiracy of silence and a suppression of favorable data - thus the media and through it the public are almost completely uninformed, or even worse, mis- informed about air bags. An informed public will accept and should demand an air bag system. Minimal utilization of active restraints (lap and shoulder belts) mandates passive restraints (air bags). It is felt that SAE has a duty to cause a speed-up in the present rate of availability of air bags. The ultimate savings in lives and reduction in serious injuries as well as automobile insurance costs will be gratifying and substantial. 720432. Product Liability for Active and Passive Restraint Systems. Richard M. Goodman, Goodman, Eden, Robb, Millender, Goodman &amp; Bedrosian. In this paper you will find problems posed by threatened lawsuits arising out of potential defects in passive restraint systems. For many years, it was recognized that the manu- facturer of an automobile was liable for defects in manufacture or design which produce injuries. Now the question is should part of the cost of claims and verdicts be shifted to the government - this might make the government more responsive to the feasibility of adopting particular safety systems. 720433. Passive Preloaded Energy-Absorbing Seat Belt System Improved Belt Systems. H. P. Willumeit, Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). Safety belt restraint systems can be improved by using semi-passive and full passive devices which lead to a high and increasing utilization without a considerable decrease on the user's comfort. Improvements for increased injury protection are given by introducing belt force limiters and devices which eliminate the belt slack at the moment of crash beginning and furthermore give a certain preload to the belts enabling the passenger to take part in the vehicle deceleration almost from crash onset. Results of sled tests complete the description. A final comparison with the airbag shows the higher protection possibilities of belt restraint systems against injuries. 1972 SAE Transactions 137</page><page sequence="63">720434-720440 138 720434. Threepoint Energy-Absorbing Seat Belt System with Combined Vehicle- and Webbing-Sensitive Emergency Retractor. Ulrich W. Seiffert, Erich Carbon and Helmut Ristau, Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). The principles of seatbelts for the VW-vehicles with a retractor which is sensitive to vehicle deceleration and to webbing acceleration is described. In addition, possibil- ities are shown to reduce the Severity Index with energy absorbing devices in the seat belt retractor or in the B-pillar-ring. The results show that the requirements from the NHTSA up to Notice No. 16 of Docket 69-7 cannot be fulfilled in relation to the Severity Index (SI). 720435. A Semipassive Seat Belt System. Derek P. Peck, Triumph Motor Co., England. This paper describes a semipassive seat belt system that was one of a series developed during a program to examine the possibilities of modifying seat belt designs to meet the passive occupant restraint requirements in the original proposed amendment to FMVSS 208. As such, many features are prohibited by the interlock ignition option of the latest amended 208. This semipassive seat belt installation utilizes a system of electrical interlocks to achieve an improved seat belt wearing rate. It is estimated that a usage rate of 95% would be achieved, making it more effective than an air bag. 720436. Design Approach and Crash Performance of Automatic Seat Belt Systems. G. M. Bradford, J. Broughton and H. Jakob, American Safety Equipment Corp. Automatic seat belts are presented as a method of complying with proposed government regulations re- quiring passive protection against occupant injury from vehicle collisions. Operational models have been installed in current model cars. The proven field performance of belt systems now in cars reducing fatalities and injuries is the fundamental basis for considering the automatic seat belt. Several design approaches for automatic seat belts are explored and described. Webbing and hardware modi- fications to adapt the configuration of the belt systems to present car interiors are described in detail. Dynamic testing results are presented to compare crash perform- ance to current production belt systems now in cars. 720437. Starter-Interlock Systems as Passive Restraints. Charles H. Pulley, American Safety Belt Coun- cil. Various studies by automobile companies, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the Gov- ernment Services Administration have demonstrated that starter-interlock systems can dramatically increase safety belt use - in fact, can increase belt use to the 75-90% level. Such systems offer immediate advantages over any passive restraint systems because they are available now and can be installed in production quantities for very little cost on all new cars. The starter-interlock system can also be retrofitted to older model cars that already have safety belt fittings. Another way of increasing belt usage would be for the states and cities to pass mandatory use laws. Such laws have been enacted in Australia and in Brooklyn, Ohio. In these areas, safety belt use is up 50-70% and traffice fatalities down 30% in one area and down 50% in another. 720438. Passive and Semi-Passive Seat Belts for In- creased Occupant Safety. H. George Johannessen and Gerald A. Yates, Hamill Manufacturing Co., The Firestone Tire &amp; Rub- ber Co. Developments leading to passive seat belts are discussed. A problem in semantics is identified, and a distinction is drawn between "passive" and "semi-passive" seat belts. A low-injury passive seat belt precursor is described, having a continuous webbing loop for lap and shoulder belt and an emergency-locking retractor. The seat belt system indicates potential for improving upon present seat belt systems, and with identifiable modifications, being converted into a passive occupant restraint configuration, and being later modified to provide 40-mph crash survival capability. 720439. The Automatic Cushion Restraint - A New Passive Safety Program. Geoffrey Grime, Britax, England. The new passive restraint system comprises a pad or cushion automatically retained in place against the chest of a car occupant, and a knee restraint. In normal circumstances, the chest restraint is held in contact with the occupant by light spring pressure so that he is free to lean forward to reach door handles and the like; in an accident, the arm supporting the pad is locked in position, and forward movement of the chest is then controlled by the force exerted by the pad. Variation of this force with distance is determined by the characteristics of an energy absorber, which governs the movement of the arm. The forward movement of the lower part of the body is controlled by the knee restraint which must be capable of considerable deformation. Both calculation and results of sled tests indicate that the system is likely to give good protection in frontal impacts, while extensive driving experience with prototype installations has produced favorable opinions on its acceptability to the driving public. 720440. A Passive Safety Belt System. Stig Pilhall and Nils Bohlin, AB Volvo (Sweden). The geometry and behavior of several front-seat passive belt configurations have been studied and evaluated. General design criteria are discussed. The preferred solution is a three-point belt with two ends attached to the door. The belt straps automatically, and for comfortable exit, the occupant may make a slight manual operation.</page><page sequence="64">720441-720447 Crash tests indicate that the belt performs approx- imately as a standard three-point belt. Door strength, retractor strength, strap strength and tension, seat influ- ence, etc., have been tested. Curves are given for recorded and computed data, including old and new severity index. 1972 SA E Transactions 720441. Hazard Indices and Their Relationship to An- thropomorphic Dummies. Jule Brinn, Chrysler Corp. This paper discusses some of the very serious problems associated with the use of anthropomorphic dummies in crash testing of automobiles. These problems arise primarily from the nonrepeatable behavior of the dummy and from the unknown correlation between its behavior and that of the human. The combination of these factors leads to scatter in test restults and in their interpretation which are well beyond the usual range of engineering practice. The systems approach to crash testing can be placed on a true scientific basis only by increasing our under- standing of the dummy/human relationship and by decreasing test scatter. Test programs relating to these problem areas are described. These tests demonstrate that the results obtained are heavily dependent on the data analysis scheme employed. Results obtained by use of the mathematical analog technique are compared to other methods. The analog approach is found to minimize scatter in tests results and yield values which compare favorably with our limited human tolerance knowledge. Results of dummy head impacts against windshields are shown to approximate theoretical considerations when the brain analog technique is employed. The study concludes that the organ analog approach appears to analyze dummy test results in a more meaningful manner than other current techniques; how- ever our knowledge of human tolerance as well as of dummy construction will require considerable advance- ment before safety systems testing is upgraded from an art to a science. 720442. Airbag Effects on the Out-of-Position Child. Lawrence M. Patrick and Gerald W. Nyquist, Biomechanics Research Center, Wayne State University. This paper describes experiments involving airbag sys- tems. Because there is the least amount of data on the tolerance of children to impact, the out-of-position child was used in the experiments. After careful consideration it was decided that a primate of approximately the same weight as a child be used, which would provide the most realistic evaluation of potential injuries. The animal chosen for the experimental program was the baboon. Five distinct positions were chosen and this paper describes in detail the experimental physiological con- ditions and results. 1972 SA E Transactions 720443. Human Volunteer Testing of GM Air Cushions. G. R. Smith, S. S. Huri te and A. J. Yanik, General Motors Corp.; and C. R. Greer, St. Joseph's Hospital, Houston, Texas. From November 1970 through August 1971 an extensive program of static and dynamic air cushion inflation tests utilizing human volunteers was conducted at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, sponsored by the De- partment of Transportation. Forty-one full cushion deployment static firings were made, with air cushion hardware and seating buck environment designed by General Motors. The static series was followed by 35 dynamic sled firings of human volunteers, beginning at 8.6 g (15.1 mph) and culminating at 21.7 g (31.5 mph). A major objective of both the static and dynamic test series was to identify changes in air cushion design found necessary to improve its protective capability for human beings. Because of the severity of cushion deployment, one modification was made following the initial static tests: The orifice diameter size of the bag inlet was reduced from 1.0 to 0.6 in to diminish the rapidity of bag inflation. This modification proved effective in the dynamic series. As far as the human element in the dynamic series is concerned, no severe injuries beyond erythema, abrasion, contusion, and blister were received. As a result of this program, and testing of baboons at Wayne State University, an improved "augmented" GM air cushion is being developed and hopefully will be man-evaluated in the future. 1972 SA E Transactions 720445. Passive Protection at 50 Miles Per Hour. R. L. Carter, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration. The paper examines the engineering and economic feasibility of inflatable restraint systems and structural modifications required to achieve passive protection for occupants in passenger car frontal collisions at 50 mph equivalent barrier speed. Vehicle structural modifications, already proven in prototype tests, are examined for compatibility in car-to-car crashes. The special aspects of inflatable restraint systems capable of 50 mph protection are also discussed, taking into account the improvements in system behavior made possible by structural modifi- cations. Costs and benefits are also projected. It is concluded that cost effective 50 mph protection can be achieved. 1972 SA E Transactions 720447. An Investigation of Thermal Conditions Leading to Surface Rupture of Cast Iron Rotors. Rudolf Limpert, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the thermal performance characteristics of solid rotor disc brakes. Using the results of mathematical and computer analyses, as well as road test experiments, relationships for predicting the temperature and thermal stress response of 139</page><page sequence="65">720448-720452 140 the rotor are developed for braking in a single stop. Special emphasis is given to determining the onset of surface cranking as a result of different braking condi- tions. A design criterion for avoidance of surface rupture in a single stop is developed. Results obtained in the analytical and experimental study indicate that acceptable correlation between tem- perature prediction and measurement require an exact assessment of the distribution of braking energy between tire and brake and rotor and pad. Thermally induced surface rupture was found to occur when the theoretical compressive surface stress exceeded the yield strength of the material. Inspection of the rotor surface under the microscope showed that single brake applications from a speed of 60 mph produced surface rupture, caused mainly by the temperature gradient existing at the surface of the rotor. For higher rotor temperatures attained over longer periods of time during repeated braking, other factors such as fatigue properties and composition changes have a significant effect upon rotor surface deterioration. 1972 SA E Transactions 720448. Device for Applying Brake Pedal at a Controlled Rate for Impact Brake Testing. Glen E. Schaefer and Dennis P. Derrick, Delco Moraine Div., General Motors Corp. The determination of the impact load capability of vehicle brake system components is necessary to verify product design requirements. Testing methods and procedures must minimize the variables inherent in vehicle "spike stop" applications to assure the acquisition of accurate, meaningful test data. This paper describes the design, development, and characteristics of a device currently in use for "spike stop" brake applications at a vehicle test facility. 720449. Effects of Surface Roughness of Brake Drums on Coefficient of Friction and Lining Wear. S. K. Rhee and P. A. Thesier, Research Labs., Bendix Corp. The effects of surface roughness of brake drums on coefficient of friction (brake torque) and lining wear were investigated using typical commercial grey cast iron drums and typical commercial linings. Sample and inertia dynamometers were used. The surface roughness is found to significantly affect the coefficient of friction (brake torque) and lining wear, though the effect is dependent upon the lining compositions. The significance and implications of these findings are discussed. 720450. Radioisotope Reveals Behavior of Lubricants in Two-Stroke Cycle Engines. Takashi Kohayakawa, Yoshimi Hirai, Tsugio Ogawa and Eizi Suzuki, Daihatsu Kogyo Co., Ltd. Studies have been conducted for determining the distri- bution of the lubricant in a crankcase scavenged two- stroke cycle engine. Presently, it is not obvious how newly supplied oil reaches each engine part and how it leaves the engine through the exhaust gas. Furthermore, it is desirable to know what percent of the supplied oil is exhausted during the scavenging period and what percent is burned in the combustion chamber with the gasoline. Three different lubrication systems were studied utilizing radioisotopes: premixed fuel and oil; manifold supply system for the oil; and crankcase supply system for the oil. The lubricating oil was tagged with tritium. The lubricating oil behavior in the crankcase scavenged two-stroke engine has been investigated within the limited operating condition of these tests. The results show that almost all supplied oil was exhausted within one hour, and the remainder was exhausted gradually. With the premixed supply system, the oil supplied to the engine is exhausted through the exhaust system more rapidly than when the separate lubrication supply system is used. Thus, in the separate supply systems - the manifold supply and crankcase supply systems - the amount of oil remaining in the engine is greater and the residence time longer than that of the premixed supply system for the same engine operating conditions. Con- sequently, superior lubrication characteristics can be expected with the separate lubrication systems for crank- case scavenged two-stroke cycle engines.

M ulticy linder 2-cycle, water-cooled outboard motors were modified to allow testing of up to three different fuel-oil blends simultaneously. A special "floating laboratory" test barge was designed and constructed for operation of the outboards. Engine protection and metering facilities were provided in the control room on the barge. Repeatability studies were then carried out to determine the precision of the test using multiple references in four outboard motors. Results indicated that a high degree of precision was attainable. Some results from fuel and lubricant evalu- ations, which followed, are included. Discussion: Jack Dilworth, McCulloch Corp.; C. R. Spohn and D.

In Japan, test methods for evaluating the performance of 2-cycle engine oils have been developed separately by each 2-cycle engine manufacturer. The reason for this is that there are many differences in engine performance and in lubrication methods. Evaluation through bench tests is used as a valid method for screening engine oils prior to field tests. Field tests are conducted eventually as the most reliable test method for evaluating the performance of engine oils. Yamaha Motor, one of the leading Japanese 2-cycle engine manufacturers, developed a "70 min engine test</page><page sequence="66">720453-720458 method" in 1963, which can be conducted in a relatively short period of time with good reproducibility. In this paper, several problems regarding Yamaha's 70 min engine test method are discussed. 720453. Developments in Dynamometer Control Meth- ods. Robert W. Clements and Michael A. Richard, Chrysler Corp. The application of automation to dynamometer testing of engines has led to the development of specialized circuits and techniques to compensate for limitations inherent within the electromechanical systems used to implement automation theory. Stable, quick response to a programmed speed change has been achieved for engine-automatic transmission testing by the use of a parallel feedback technique. Vehicle simulation using analog computer circuitry and road test data is used to calculate torque requirements from programmed acceleration-time and velocity-time curves. Similar circuitry is used to calculate engine- transmission output torque from dynamometer parame- ters. 720454. Transient Engine Testing by Computer Control. J. F. Cassidy, Jr. and J. H. Rillings, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper describes a computer controlled engine test cell being developed at the General Motors Research Labo- ratories. The object is to combine the advantages of the controlled experimental conditions possible in an engine test cell with the dynamic capabilities of a vehicle driven on the road or on a chassis dynamometer to produce a unique research and development tool. The overall system, consisting of an IBM 1800 process control computer linked to an electric dynamometer and engine in an engine test cell, is introduced. This is followed by a description of the test cell control and data acquisition instrumentation and of the pallet system which permits prebuilding of engine experimental packages for rapid installation in the test cell. An overview of the computer programs, with emphasis on user interaction is presented. The throttle and speed control algorithms, which apply road or chassis dynamometer load conditions to the engine in the engine test cell are discussed. Typical engine torque, speed and exhaust emission results are shown for a 1970 California cycle run on an engine in the test cell. 1972 SA E Transactions 720455. A Comparison of Dynamic Exhaust Emission Tests: Chassis Dynamometer vs. Engine Dy- namometer. J. F. Cassidy, Jr., Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Exhaust emission tests run on an engine dynamometer are compared with those run on a chassis dynamometer. The worst ease average difference between the chassis and engine dynamometer mass emissions, obtained over a period of six months, was less than 7%. The elimination of the driver, vehicle, and chassis dynamometer yielded significant improvement in test reproducibility with respect to carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. A digital computer was used to control speed and throttle position of the engine dynamometer experiments. No transmission was used. The computer and engine dynamometer duplicated transient effects of transmission, vehicle, and chassis dynamometer. 1972 SA E Transactions 720456. Defining System Requirements and Writing Specifications. Michael C. Kasprzyk, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Successful computer monitoring and control applications require careful problem and system definition, especially if a system integrator is used for a turn key type installation. The concepts of interactive design and vendor involvement are presented as fundamental to writing specifications and defining system requirements for successfully solving the problem. 720457. User's View of Process Control Computer Sys- tems Management. Richard R. Perryman and Norman E. Prochaska, Ford Motor Co. A survey of industrial control computer applications presently operational in this user's facilities revealed an approximate 50/50 division between those that were internally and externally implemented. Problems en- countered in the planning, launching, and follow-up phase of system installation were found to be common to both internal and external system implementations and are categorized and evaluated as being inherent and envi- ronmental in nature. In an effort to avoid anticipated problems characteristic of a computerized installation, proper staffing as an inhouse project team is essential. During the process of developing inhouse talent, three plateaus of system implementation maturity are attained. These plateaus range from complete dependency upon outside assistance to "do it yourself" inhouse imple- mentation. Flow charts are developed to depict typical decision paths leading to a plateau of system implemen- tation most appropriate for the particular user "turnkey dilemma." 720458. Systems Management - Mainframe Vendor. E. M. Becker, IBM-CCS Marketing Representa- tive. Mainframe vendors generally are very recent entrants into the systems management marketplace. Customer demands for complete service and support of their application development and implementation, particularly in the sensor-based areas, were responsible for their entry. This paper discusses the life cycle of a typical systems management contract from preproposal analysis to Phase 1 (design) to Phase 2 (implementation) to customer turnover. Also presented is a typical statement of work from a typical proposal. 141</page><page sequence="67">720459-720466 142 720459. Systems Management by a Systems House. David A.

Public Confusion over Gasoline: Where Are the Engineers? A. J. Fritsch, Center for Science in the Public Interest. Industrial practices can cause consumer confusion. The failure to communicate between the highest levels of automotive and petroleum companies provides an ex- ample. Gasoline is taken for granted by the driving public. It is extremely toxic and its emission products are a major contributing factor to air pollution. Engineers know how automotive and gasoline problems are interlocked. The Clean Air Act has forced scientists and engineers to cooperate. Technological solutions and cleanup timetables are insurmountable only when this collaboration is missing. The substantiation of gasoline advertisements, trade secrecy, standardization, and lead consumption are also covered in this paper. To preserve a safe and pollution-free environment, the scientist and the engineer have a duty to anticipate toxic and unsafe products and company practices. 720461. Metropolitan Engineers Council on Air Re- sources - Activities in 1971. Sidney B. Tuwiner, MECAR. MECAR (Metropolitan Engineers Council on Air Re- sources), organized in 1965 to represent the engineering profession through its various societies in the New York metropolitan area, has four objectives: 1. To advise on standards and formulation of laws to improve air quality. 2. To serve law enforcement agencies in an advisory capacity. 3. To alert city, county, regional authorities, and the general public to pollution problems. 4. To inculcate within the engineering profession the need to cope with the sociotechnical problem. The group attempts to maintain consistency of direction of policy in matters pertaining to air quality in metropolitan areas. 720462. Professional Ethics and Environmental Technol- ogy. M. R. J. Wyllie, Gulf Oil Co. The premise of this paper is that many of the problems facing society are technological at heart, and can be solved only by the application of better technology by technologists. Further, it is the duty of technological organizations to present and publicize impartial, balanced advice to the public and government as to the best courses of action to pursue. The author illustrates his hypothesis by taking three areas as examples, namely, the population explosion, the eutrophication of lakes, and automobile emissions. For each, he examines currently disseminated information, points up inaccuracies in much of this information, and suggests avenues to be explored in working for solutions. 1972 SAE Transactions 720463. Higher Orders of Tire Force Variations and Their Significance. W. K. Klamp and J. Meingast, Uniroyal, Inc. A number of tires have been examined in terms of the higher orders of radial and fore-and-aft force variations. Presented in this paper are some typical values of higher orders as measured on a specially designed high-speed machine. These measurements are related to the following factors: 1. Tire operating conditions. 2. Tire construction variations. 3. Influence of wheel and balance. 4. Radial force correction. 5. Ride evaluation. With experience, emphasis has shifted to understand- ing how tire manufacturing introduces higher harmonic disturbances, and thereby improving tire production, and making better use of conventional uniformity grading equipment. 720465. The On-Car Tire Grinder for Improved Ride Smoothness. R. J. Caulfield, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and R. J. Higgins, Service Research, General Motors Corp. "Smooth road shake" complaints resulting from tire and wheel nonuniformities have been greatly reduced on original equipment tires. However, the problem still exists on aftermarket tires that have not been ground. The On-Car Tire Grinder (OCG) was developed by General Motors Research to provide a means for correcting smooth road shake complaints in the field. The device effectively duplicates the grinding done on original equipment tires. It has a low initial cost, does not require removing the tire from the car, and has proved practical for service use. Several companies have been given a free license to manufacture the on-car grinder for sale to tire stores and automobile dealers. 720466.

This paper covers the features of rotary engines with charge-cooled rotors developed by Yanmar Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. It includes test results obtained with charge- cooled rotors during the course of development of the engine with this feature. With continuing new applications of the NSU/Wankel rotary engine, charge-cooling ap- pears to be a promising feature, especially in small-sized engines, from the point of view of simple structure and improved economy. 1972 SAE Transactions</page><page sequence="68">720467-720473 720467.

Discussion of the rotary-combustion engine's history, operation, and lubrication illustrates the role of various quality level engine oils in providing the necessary functions of engine seal wear protection, bearing lubri- cation, rotor cooling, and overall combustion chamber area cleanliness. Specific examples of current quality and experimental-type engine oil influence on overall engine durability, including seal and housing surface wear, are cited for various engine designs. Data evaluating lube oil effects on engine cleanliness and oil consumption char- acteristics are also discussed. Analysis of used oil from a number of test engines is presented showing the rotary- combustion engine to yield oil deterioration typical of current piston engines. 720468. Development of Rotating Combustion Engines at Curtiss-Wright. Charles Jones, Curtiss-Wright Corp. This paper summarizes the highlights of developments of the rotating combustion (RC) engine at Curtiss-Wright Corp. in each of several principal areas; speculates on remaining directions, both within and without the frame- work of previous explorations; and briefly describes germane technical features of the engines used in commercial applications of other licensees. At the same time an attempt has been made to span gaps left by previous papers or publications and to expand material considered proprietary earlier. Design features, testing, and ramifications of the RC1-60 rig engine are examined in detail. The application of the fundamentals and principles of the RC engine to automotive, aircraft, and small, air-cooled engines is also described. 720469. Specialized Road Surfaces for Traction Test Purposes. C. V. Allen and F. D. Smithson, Proving Ground, General Motors Corp. There is a growing need for specialized road surfaces in order to conduct a variety of tire and/or vehicle tests. This need arises in such areas as vehicle and/or component testing required by various Department of Transportation standards, dynamic calibration surfaces for road- monitoring "skid trailers", and comparison of tires at multiple sites on a common basis. Surfaces which would fulfill this need should meet the following objectives: 1. Be entirely prescribably utilizing easily obtainable components and simple construction techniques. This would assure that any organization could produce a desired surface with confidence of specific and repeatable results. 2. Provide the desired frictional characteristics. These could be "real world" surface characteristics, or a specific set of characteristics, or a specific set of characteristics required as a particular test parameter. 3. Exhibit reasonable durability. This paper will approach the subject of specialized surface development by discussing the basic character- istics of road surfaces which influence their frictional performance and must be controlled to obtain the desired results. These frictional phenomena are then related to specific tests to explain how they can influence results. This discussion will provide the basis for an outline of the development of a specialized road surface which was designed to meet the previously outlined objectives. 1972 SA E Transactions 720471. Testing and Analysis of Tire Hydroplaning. R. W. Yeager and J. L. Tuttle, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The ability to view the tire footprint and simultaneously to measure the tire-to-road surface interface forces is essential to the investigation of parameters affecting high-speed passenger tire performance on wet surfaces. The tire is photographed from below through a glass plate; the tire-to-road surface interface forces are recorded for various combinations of tire types, inflations, loads, wear conditions, water depth, and vehicle velocity as the tire passes over a triaxial force pin. The facility and test method are described for the evaluation of pneumatic tires at all modes of operation: free rolling, sliding, and free rolling with a slip angle. An empirical equation is given to estimate the hydroplaning speed of a passenger tire on a smooth surface in a single mode (free rolling) of operation. The parameters that affect tire hydroplaning are discussed as are some of the conditions that may influence the method of test. Implication is made that these factors and parameters also are related to high-speed wet surface braking distance. 1972 SA E Transactions 720472. Design of Laboratory Equipment for Routine Tire Force and Moment Testing. T. E. Ritter, W. S. Kristofetz, A. D. Cortese and R. E. Rasmussen, General Motors Corp. Tire force and moment test machines are used to measure mechanical properties important to vehicle handling. Many different machines have been developed for this type of work. This report discusses considerations in the design of such equipment which include productivity, road simulation, tire size range, input parameters, weigh- ing system design, and data processing. The design of a new test machine with a belt type road simulator is described. Some early test data on machine correlation, lateral force and aligning torque dynamics, and flat road uniformity are presented. 720473.

Wilson, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. 143</page><page sequence="69">720474-720479 144 A new laboratory test facility for measuring the various understeer influences on complete vehicles is described. The machine actuates the body and suspension in the same manner as it occurs on the road while turning or braking. Changes in steer and camber angles of the wheels are measured as body roll, tire lateral forces, and tire aligning torques are applied to the vehicle separately or simultaneously. It makes a direct measurement of vehicle roll susceptibility (tendency to roll in a turn). Steer caused by braking, called brake steer, is measured by applying brake forces. A description is given of the systems and interacting subsystems of the machine, which provide duplication of a wide range of actual over-the-road conditions while preventing application of unrealistic constraints to the vehicle.

Commodity Structural Foam Materials for Au- tomotive Application. D. B. Emery, Amoco Chemicals Corp. Structural foam plastic materials are increasingly being used in engineering functions as well as in areas where styling and aesthetics are important. Recent developments in plastic part designs and in processing research point toward significantly increasing uses of structural foam for automotive and truck applications. Plastic structural foam parts are not being molded that are as large as 12 ft in the longest dimension. Existing molding equipment will allow part weights as great as 100 lb to be processed. It is technically feasible to mold passenger compartment-sized parts with the present state of the art. Physical property data for structural foams are presented to assist designers and engineers in their work. 720475. Polyolefin Structural Foams for Automotive Use. Donald P. Hug and Charles C. Shockley, Hercules Incorporated. Polyolefin structural foams have the potential for large usage in the automotive industry because they have all the attractive properties of the solid polyolefins plus greater rigidity at a lower cost for molds and molding machinery. The advantages to the automobile manufacturer include: lighter vehicle weight, lower cost, better balance to offset safety and antipollution devices, greater collision safety, noise reduction, better resistance to corrosion and a smoother ride. Preliminary designs and economic studies were performed for several automobile parts including bucket seats, hoods, rear deck lids, dash panel inserts, air-conditioner housings, etc. 720476. Isocyanate Based Structural Foams. E. J. Thompson, H. E. Reymore, R. L. Grieve and A. A. R. Sayigh, The Upjohn Co. Over the past few years there has been a growing interest in the applications of isocyanate-based structural foams (Dermathane). Molds and tooling are critical to making a good article. Experience is the principal teacher in this area of technology. An analysis of various toolings and applications tells what is necessary and what is unnec- essary. Density is well-known as the most important variable when strength is considered. However, when sandwich- like structures are involved, the analysis for strength becomes more complicated. This paper includes all the processing and design information necessary for using Dermathane at the optimum strength and economy. 720477. Design Aspects of Expanded ABS. John A.

(SP-370) Status Report on HC/CO Oxidation Catalysts for Exhaust Emission Control. P. W. Snyder and W. A. Stover, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp.; and H. G. Lassen, Ford Motor Co. The 1975 Federal CVS test procedure and emission standards have placed a heavy emphasis on minimizing the time required after engine start-up to begin converting exhaust emissions. Three major improvements in catalytic HC/CO converters have been made in the past year to reduce catalyst ignition time: 1. Use of low thermal capacity monolithic catalyst supports. 2. Locating converter after thermal reactor and/or closer to the exhaust manifold. 3. Development of catalysts with superior stability to long exposure at high temperatures. 4. Development of catalysts with improved low temperature activity. Small laboratory samples of potential HC/CO oxi- dation catalysts were screened for activity in a "laboratory simulated cold-start" test with exhaust from a 2 cyl engine. Several improved catalyst candidates were eval- uated in a full size converter "cold start" test with exhaust from a 351 cu in engine.</page><page sequence="70">720480-720484 Unfortunately, the rapid thermal-chemical response of the improved catalyst, operated closer to the exhaust manifold, increases the occurrences of excessive catalyst temperatures. Math model studies of the effect of the improved catalyst properties on thermal response indicate a need to prevent unexpected high CO or HC concen- tration peaks in the engine exhaust, or to improve properties of existing catalysts. System changes, such as moving the low temperature catalyst farther from the exhaust manifold, may be required to obtain some protection from catalyst overtemperatures. These changes increase emission levels and require a breakthrough in engine control of raw emissions or improved catalysts. 1972 SA E Transactions 720480. (SP-370) NOx Reduction Catalysts for Vehicle Emission Control. G. H. Meguerian, F. W. Rakowsky and E. H. Hirschberg, American Oil Co.; and D. N. Schock, Ford Motor Co. IIEC efforts to develop NOx catalysts with improved durability have continued. Properties of several nickel oxide catalysts on pelleted, monolithic ceramic, and metallic supports are discussed and the engineering requirements for their effective use are defined. Some promoted nickel oxide, pelleted catalysts show good low temperature activity, and produce minimal amounts of ammonia but are strongly deactivated by sulfur in the feed gas. Monolithic and metallic catalysts, on the other hand, although not active at temperatures below 1000 F, are very active at higher temperatures where deactivation by sulfur and ammonia formation are not troublesome. 1972 SA E Transactions 720481. (SP-370) Methods for Fast Catalytic System Warm-Up During Vehicle Cold Starts. W. E. Bernhardt and E. Hoffmann, Volks wagen werk AG. During vehicle cold start, emissions, mass flow rates, and catalytic converter space velocities vary by orders of magnitude. Therefore, catalytic exhaust control systems must be designed to operate at high efficiency almost from the moment of engine start-up. Catalysts must reach their operating temperature as quickly as possible. Therefore, the utility of different methods for improving the warmup characteristics of catalytic systems is illustrated. A very elegant method to speed the warmup is the use of the engine itself as a "preheater" for the catalytic converters. High exhaust gas enthalpy to raise exhaust system mass up to its operating temperature is obtained by the use of extreme spark retard, stochiometric mixtures, and fully opened throttle. Intensive studies to investigate the effects of concurrent changes of spark timing and air/fuel mixtures on exhaust gas temperature, enthalpy, NOx and HC emissions are discussed. Finally, NOx catalyst characteristics are dealt with, because the NOx catalyst is the first in a dual-bed catalytic system. The NOx catalyst should have high activity, low ignition temperautre, and good warmup performance. If the NOx has a fast warmup rate, this would result even in a significant improvement in the warmup characteristic of the HC/CO bed. 1972 SA E Transactions 720482. (SP-370) Engine Testing of Catalysts - Conver- sion Versus Inlet Conditions. P. Öser, D. H. Pundt and W. Buttergeit, Volks wagen werk AG. A test procedure to determine the conversion performance of oxidation and reduction catalysts for the treatment of automotive engine exhaust gases is described. The vari- able parameters are the air/fuel ratio, the secondary air quantity and the space velocity. The results are recorded in diagrams which permit the selection of optimal catalysts with reference to the conversion and which also form the basis for the layout of the necessary devices for controlling air/fuel ratio and secondary air. Characteristic results with noble metal catalysts monolithic supports and pelleted base metal catalysts are shown. 720483. (SP-370) Mitsubishi Status Report on Low Emission Concept Vehicles. Yasuo Kaneko and Yuhiko Kiyota, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. During the past four years, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has been active in the design and development of catalytic converter systems in the IIEC Program. Experience indicates that an effective dual catalytic converter, consisting of a NOx catalyst and a HC/CO catalyst, is indispensable to achieve the stringent IIEC targets, established on the basis of 1976 Federal Stan- dards. However, there still remains a major difficulty of meeting the NOx target since NO is regenerated in the HC/CO catalyst in the dual converter system. This paper describes our major efforts in seeking a breakthrough to control the NOx emission, and covers some noteworthy findings on transient NO concentrations at the inlet and outlet of HC/CO converter in an experimental dual converter. 720484. (SP-370) Economical Matching of the Thermal Reactor to Small Engine-Low Emission Concept Vehicles. H. Kuroda, Y. Nakajima, Y. Hayashi and K. Sugihara, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The Inter-Industry Emission Control (IIEC) Program included the thermal reactor as one of the effective ways of oxidizing HC and CO in the exhaust system. However, this was accompanied by very substantial fuel economy penalties, especially in the case of small engine-low emission concept vehicles. Starting with a new concept aimed at obtaining the HC/CO oxidizing trigger temperature in the thermal reactor by modifying engine settings, the authors arrived at an economical technique of matching the thermal reactor to the engine. 1972 SA E Transactions 145</page><page sequence="71">720485-720490 146 720485. (SP-370) Fiat Status Report on Low Emission Concept Vehicles. Carlo Pollone, Fiat S.p.A. The work reported has been done in the last year as part of Fiat's collaboration with the Inter-Industry Emission Control Program. Emission results obtained on two concept cars are shown, including respectively: thermal reactor, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), HC/CO catalytic converter, and NOx and HC/CO catalytic converters. Work is also reported on screening of materials for thermal reactors and catalysts. 720486. (SP-370) Toyo Kogyo Status Report on Low Emission Concept Vehicles. K. Tanaka, M. Akutagawa, K. Ito, Y. Higashi and K. Kobayashi, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. This paper describes the extensive effort and progress made by the Toyo Kogyo Co. in developing emission control systems applicable to small vehicles with small displacement reciprocating engines, in order to achieve the very stringent targets established by the IIEC program. Three concept emission package systems have been selected as showing promise to achieve the targets, and these packages have been under evaluation for emission performance and durability in the total vehicle systems, which were experimentally built. These package systems incorporate component sys- tems such a thermal reactors, EGR, catalytic converters, and other subcomponents to assist these main component systems. Despite the effort made to date, none of these package systems have reached the stage of satisfying the HC/CO targets over extended vehicle mileage, of the NOx target, even at zero vehicle miles. The durability of these package systems has been revealed as unsatisfactory. Frequent maintenance oper- ations are required to adjust or replace the component devices in order to maintain very low emission levels during the course of the durability mileage. 720487. (SP-370) Toyota Status Report on Low Emission Concept Vehicles. T. Inoue, K. Goto and K. Matsumoto, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. The status of Toyota's development of low emission concept packages - NOx and HC/CO catalytic converter and EGR, and thermal reactor, NOx and HC/CO catalytic converter and EGR - and their components is described. Variations of thermal reactor design, performance and durability characteristics are discussed. Above the throttle valve entry EGR has been found to have desirable flow characteristics with a simple control system. EGR rate over 15% brings about unaccep tably poor driveability and fuel economy with smaller vehicles. Many types of catalytic converters for pelleted catalysts have been designed and examined for their performance and durability. A down-flow-type converter has relatively good flow distribution and warmup char- acteristics. As for HC and CO, a few prototype vehicles have met the 1975 federal regulation at low mileage, but the 1976 regulation for NOx of 0.4 gm/mi is very difficult to meet even with a significant penalty in driveability and economy for our smaller vehicles. 720488. (SP-370) Ford Durability Experience on Low Emission Concept Vehicles. R. M. Campau, A. Stefan and E. E. Hancock, Ford Motor Co. Recent vehicle durability experience with low emission concept hardware systems is described. The low-emission concept systems discussed include: thermal reactor only, a combined thermal reactor and HC/CO monolithic cata- lyst system, and a system combining low thermal inertia exhaust manifolds with dual-bed (NOx and HC/CO) catalytic converters. Problems shown to influence either emission per- formance or vehicle function during both atypical and normal vehicle operation include: the melting of mono- lithic structures used to support both the NOx and the HC/CO catalytic promoters, the deleterious effect of the sulfur content of gasoline on the performance of pelleted NOx catalysts, and the loss of emission control with malfunctioning engine components. Vehicle fuel economy and performance losses with these types of systems is documented. Current redesign efforts on these low emission concept vehicle systems in an attempt to overcome the durability problems are described. Such redesign efforts include possible alterations in fuel volatility characteristics of the gasoline. 720490. Metal Foams as Energy Absorbers for Automo- bile Bumpers. L. M. Niebylski and R. J. Fan- ning, Ethyl Corp. Evaluations of aluminum foams show they can be efficient energy absorbers. They are especially interesting because they have virtually no rebounding characteristics. The load-compression response characteristics of the foam can be controlled by variations of alloy composition and foam density, thereby controlling foam strength and utility. This makes foamed metals attractive candidates for a number of automotive energy-absorption appli- cations. The energy-absorption properties of a number of aluminum alloy foams have been studied under low and medium speed impact, up to 25 mph. The foam density, volume, and size required for a 5 mph "single shot" impact shock absorber have been determined for two automotive weight classes. Nonshearing, columnar, high-density foam structures have been developed to withstand basal compressive loads. These columns have potential for multiimpact shock-absorbing applications. Work is currently under way to define foamed</page><page sequence="72">720491-720498 aluminum properties and design required for use in bumpers for 50 mph barrier and pole impacts. 1972 SA E Transactions 720491. The 1973 Chrysler Energy Absorbing Bumper System. J. D. Withrow and D. N. Renneker, Chrysler Corp. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the 1973 Chrysler Corp. bumper system, its detailed construction, the energy management scheme used, and the engineering methods applied to the design of the elastomeric bumper guards and the effect of these guards on the overall energy levels transmitted into the vehicle. The 1973 bumper system was designed to meet and exceed the 1973 DOT exterior protection standards by methodically analyzing the impact event and developing an efficient energy management scheme which takes full advantage of the vehicle as an energy absorber. Addi- tional energy absorption is provided by the efficient use of elastomeric bumper guards. This system has proven to be both theoretically and practically efficient for impact speeds up to 5 mph. Several materials were considered for use as impact pads. These materials have various properties over the full temperature range but show efficiences ranging 25-40% at the effective stress levels. 720493. Development of the First Sheet Molding Com- pound (SMC) Body Component: The Chrysler Station Wagon Air Deflector. George J. Currier, Chrysler Corp. The Chyrsler Corporation made use of a thermosetting polyester sheet-molding-compound (SMC) to provide an efficient, neat-appearing, and economical station wagon air deflector for its 1969 full-size station wagons. This marked Chrysler's first usage of this material for a major automotive body component. 720494. Development and Analysis of Door Side-Impact Reinforcements. John S. Haynes, Chrysler Corp. A door side-impact reinforcement beam has been devel- oped that allows efficient use of material in resisting side crush loads. The beam section can be roll formed, thus permitting further economies in fabrication. Analytical techniques have been developed that evaluate and handle bending, buckling, and crippling in beam design. This paper covers the development that led up to these results and includes a detailed description of how to apply the analytical methods. 1972 SA E Transactions 720495. Rollover Testing. R. A. Wilson and R. R. Gannon, Safety Res. &amp; Dev. Lab., General Motors Corp. Testing for vehicle rollover performance has proven to be a formidable challenge for the impact test engineer. Realism and repeatability have been difficult to define, let alone produce. Field accident data do not provide a "typical" rollover situation to imitate. Vehicle kinematics, vehicle damage, and occupant injuries cover a very wide spectrum. This paper will cover the history of rollover testing, the current rollover picture from field accidents, and GM's recent experience with a new rollover test method. 720496. Crash Data Analysis. G. G. Lim, Ford Motor Co. A new technique for body/frame cars to predict the vehicle collapse, velocity, and deceleration histories in a barrier crash at any speed between 10 and 30 mph has been developed. This approach requires data interpolation from a minimum of two and preferably three barrier tests conducted with no additional instrumentation than that already present in today's standard testing. Potential savings could be derived from using this technique to reduce the number of barrier tests that would otherwise be necessary for checking safety restraint performance throughout the crash speed spectrum contained within the test boundaries. Good correlation with tests was obtained with the 1969 Ford car line. Application of this technique to the 1971 Mercury showed similar favorable results. Applicability of the equations to body/frame configu- rations other than those tested has not been determined. 1972 SA E Transactions 720497. Urban Vehicle Design Competition History, Progress, Development. Vincent S. Darago and Charles M. McCuen, Urban Vehicle Design Competition. The Urban Vehicle Design Competition was inspired by the success of the Clean Air Car Race and the Great Electric Car Race. The academic community recognized the tremendous educational value of these events, and encouraged development of UVDC from its inception. The project was designed by engineering students to benefit students throughout North America. The rules of the competition include technical paper requirements that make the competition extremely attractive to professors who wish to build a course around this theme. The response of more than 2000 engineering students at 80 universities throughout the United States and Canada has indicated the success of the structure of the competition. The first major objective of the UVDC project has been met. Ninety- three teams throughout the country entered the UVDC design portion of the contest. The second portion of the project is the prototype contest of August 1972. At this time, student-developed and modi- fied vehicles will compete for UVDC honors as the best urban vehicle. 720498. Exhaust Emission Levels of In-Service Vehicles Comparison of 1970 and 1971 Surveys. F. L. Voelz, E. C. Coleman, J. S. Segal and B. G. Gower, Atlantic Richfield Co. The results of a nationwide automobile exhaust emission survey conducted in 1971 are presented and compared to data obtained from a 1970 survey. Average hydrocarbon 147</page><page sequence="73">720499-720504 148 and carbon monoxide emissions are given for engine speeds of idle and 2500 rpm. Vehicle distribution curves for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are shown for the 1971 data for selected year groups based on emission control devices. Comparison of the distribution curves obtained from the 1971 and 1970 data show that "deterioration" (increased emissions) occurred at both idle and 2500 rpm in the one year period. The effects of carburetor adjustments on idle emissions are compared for the 1971 and 1970 data. 720499. Car Maintenance Expense in Owner Service With Leaded and Nonleaded Gasolines. J. S. Wintringham, A. E. Felt, W. J. Brown and W. E. Adams, Ethyl Corp. Maintenance expenses when using leaded and nonleaded gasolines are reported from a 5-year program encom- passing over 10 million miles of operation by 64 matched pairs of employee-owned cars. The data are analyzed on a fuel-related basis for those items of maintenance that might be expected to be affected by the presence or absence of lead antiknocks. Year-by-year breakdowns of important costs are presented. To provide additional information on car operating costs, total maintenance and tire replacement costs are also included. Comparisons are made with previously reported information, and projections regarding the significance of these costs are made for the future. 720500. Additives Can Control Combustion Chamber Deposit Induced Hydrocarbon Emissions. R. P. Doelling, A. F. Gerber, P. M. Kerschner, M. S. Raków and F. H. Robinson, Cities Service Oil Co. An investigation was undertaken to determine if gasoline additives could effect a reduction in exhaust HC emis- sions. Of the multitude of compounds studied, two were found to reduce the increase in HC emissions associated with the accumulation of lead-derived combustion cham- ber deposits by approximately 50%. A practical combi- nation of these compounds was evaluated in a fleet test which confirmed laboratory engine results. Studies were also conducted in laboratory engines and fleet vehicles to determine the effect of fuel lead level upon this additive's effectiveness and the activity of the additive upon established lead-derived combustion chamber deposits. Results obtained from these programs indicated that the additive would function with fuel lead levels from i/2-3 g/gal, but that it was not capable of modifying established deposits. A rationale for the observed effect is presented. 720501. Automotive Lamp Outage Detection. F. J. Scharf, Lake Center Industries. A presentation of potential solutions for detecting and indicating failed exterior automotive running lamps is provided. Comments and summaries of research in the areas of reed switches, photocells, magnetics, and elec- tronic devices are given. Basic design specifications are established along with the posing of other significant system design criteria that must be resolved by automotive companies or safety requirements. The electromagnetically actuated reed switch best satisfies the design requirements for a stable, economical, and usable system. Comprehensive theoretical reed relay systems are presented and their impact on the automotive electrical system is discussed. 1972 SA E Transactions 720502. Electronic Lamp Monitoring. James W. McNamee, Packard Electric Div., General Mo- tors Corp.; and Sumner B. Marshall, Sprague Electric Co. In describing the electronic lamp monitoring system developed at Packard Electric Div. of General Motors Corp., this paper discusses the requirements of lamp monitoring systems, presents a brief history of such systems at Packard Electric, explains how the system functions, and details the method of assembling the system into General Motors automobiles. The requirements for a lamp monitoring system are: it should be able to monitor all types of exterior lamps on the automobile, and the number of lamps must not be critical to design; it must be easy to assemble; it should be simple in design so that it can be repaired in the field with minimum training of personnel; it must be reliable and able to withstand the electrical and environmental conditions to which the vehicle is subjected; there should be minimal change from one car line to another and from one model year to another; and most importantly, the unit cost should be reasonable. 720503. Interior Window Fogging - An Analysis of the Parameters Involved. Alexander R. Peters, Uni- versity of Nebraska. Many factors are directly related to the occurrence of window fogging and flash fogging. The pertinent variables affecting the problem are identified and discussed. In simple terms, fogging is dependent upon the difference between the dew point temperature of the interior environment and the glass surface temperature. Several dew point and glass temperature curves have been computed which typify various operating conditions. Alternatives that will help to eliminate fogging are discussed. 1 972 SAE Transactions 720504. Wax Method of Determining Windshield Defroster Performance. Ward J. Atkinson and Boris P. Muchnij, Chevrolet Motor Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp. This paper describes a procedure for determining</page><page sequence="74">720506-720511 defroster performance using wax. The approach is a useful tool for establishing breakthrough points, and developing balanced defroster air distribution patterns prior to cold room testing. Since it can be conducted at room temper- ature, the wax method is considerably more convenient and can be executed with greater frequency than in a cold room. Although the wax procedure is a good barometer of the relative effectiveness of different defroster systems, and does provide valuable preliminary studies, it does not duplicate cold room conditions. The test method de- scribed, therefore, is not a substitute for, nor can it be used in place of, actual cold room testing. The paper provides information on the test facility, test equipment, test preparation, wax mixture and application, and conducting the test. 720506. The Objective Method of Evaluating Aspiration Wind Noise. Harry Jagtiani, Chrysler Corp. The automobile industry places a major emphasis on reducing car interior noise levels to attain a more pleasant and comfortable ride. In recent years, improved super- highways, allowing higher car speeds, have created a rise in the aspiration wind noise due to high aerodynamic pressure differentials causing air to pass by the body seals. No longer is a car body sealed merely against water leaks. With the increased use of air conditioning in cars, the closed side windows have lowered the ambient interior noise, thereby exposing the broad band frequency aspi- ration wind noise. A need for an objective method for the quality control and development of body seals was imminent. This report analyzes the aspiration wind noise parameters and presents two objective methods of meas- uring aspiration wind noise. These methods, using a meter, replace the previously used method of subjective evaluation of the loudness of wind noise. 720507. Importance of Acoustical Leaks in Passenger Car Bodies. J. D. Shedlowsky, Pontiac Motor Div., General Motors Corp. In its treatment of acoustical leaks in passenger car bodies, this paper considers the general principle of noise control in a passenger compartment, the concept of acoustical leaks, examples of such leaks, and design guidelines for acoustical isolation. The paper states that the basic problems can actually be designed into vehicles through lack of understanding of acoustical principle, and various examples are given in illustration. Remedies for some of these déficiences are also proposed. Finally, design principles formulated to eliminate acoustic leaks are presented. 720508. Vehicle Sound Package - Art or Science? J. R. Peart and T. V. Huber, Ford Motor Co. Sound package engineering has always been an art developed through experience and much subjective road testing. Because the problem is complex, it is essential to have a logical procedure to achieve the most efficient sound package. The quite car concept is proposed as a solution. Additionally, a plea is made for relevant automobile-oriented material test procedures to be rec- ognized industry-wide. 720509. Low NOx Emissions From Automotive Engine Combustion. James G. Hansel, Esso Research and Engineering Co. A wide range of air/fuel ratios and exhaust gas recycle rates were examined in an automotive test engine for the purpose of reducing NOx emissions to low levels. A minimum NOx level of 0.4 g/mile on the 1972 Federal Test Procedure was obtained at a rich A/F of 12 and a recycle rate of 25%. With this combination, the fuel consumption increased approximately 15% and the wide open throttle (WOT) power decreased about 30%. Com- bustion in the cylinders was good and the vehicle operated smoothly. Comparable results were not obtained with lean mixtures. The results of this study do not establish the feasibility of meeting the 1976 NOx standard with the rich mixture, high recycle technique. Further, the increased CO and HC emissions would have to be controlled by exhaust gas treatment. 720510. A Systems Approach to Vehicle Emission Con- trol. E. N. Cantwell, R. A. Hoffman, I. T. Rosenlund and S. W. Ross, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). Exhaust manifold thermal reactors, exhaust gas recircu- lation, exhaust particulate trapping systems, and appro- priate engine adjustments have been combined to produce total emission control systems which reduce all gaseous and exhaust particulate emissions from passenger vehicles. The first generation system was developed to meet the former U.S. and State of California emission standards for 1975. Field service tests demonstrated that the emission standards were met but unexpected operational problems were encountered. Solutions to these problems have been found. Second generation total emission control systems are being developed in an attempt to meet the current U.S. emission standards for 1975-1976. These systems in their present state of development produce very low exhaust emission levels; the hydrocarbons are well below the standards and the carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide levels are quite close to the 1975-1976 standards. Possible approaches to reduce the emissions even further and alleviate partially the losses in fuel economy are discussed. 1972 SA E Transactions 720511. Field Test of an Exhaust Gas Recirculation System for the Control of Automotive Oxides of Nitrogen. John C. Chipman, John Y. Chao and Ray M. Ingels, California Air Resources Board; Roy G. Jewell and Wendell F. Deeter, Atlantic Richfield Co. The California Air Resources Board conducted an extensive field test program to evaluate a vehicle exhaust 149</page><page sequence="75">720512-720515 150 recirculation system for control of oxides of nitrogen. The system utilized hot exhaust gases from the crossover and included certain modifications to the carburetion, choke, and crank case ventilation system. It was tested on two fleets of automobiles equipped with California approved HC and CO emission control devices. The test program involved periodic measurements of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. The effect of the system on vehicle driveability, engine deposits, wear, and oil deterioration was also studied. The Atlantic Richfield Company, under contract to the Air Resources Board, equipped the vehicles with the recirculation system and performed the final engine inspection. 1972 SA E Transactions 720512. Printed Circuit Switches for Automotive Appli- . cations. S. Lemon, AMP Inc.; and G. Galbraith, Ford Motor Co. It is the intent of this paper to describe the design and advantages of printed circuit switches in general through a detailed description of one particular example. Although a number of printed circuit switches have been used successfully in a variety of applications, an automotive instrument panel switch from the Ford Lincoln-Mercury Cougar XR-7 is described because of the dramatic way this switch met the cost and reliability goals. This switch is actually a single modular unit containing three individual switch modules that control a map light, a courtesy lamp, and either a convertible top or a heated backlite. 720513. The Use of Conductive Elastomers in Hard Back Printed Circuit Switches. Paul J. Blinkilde, Essex International, Inc. Hard back printed circuit switches, also known as on-circuit switches, offer an opportunity for switch designs which are reduced in complexity and enhanced in reliability in single switch mode concepts. On-circuit switching also offers the opportunity for the consolidation of two or more switching modes into one assembly which can have reliability, cost, convenience, and styling advantages; as well as leading to simplification of connecting wiring harnesses. While having the advantages noted, the on-circuit switching concept also has limitations. Failure of the printed circuit due to mechanical wear and/or electrical erosion is a major concern. Careful selection of switching modes must be made so that electrical load and endurance requirements do not exceed the ability of the device. The Achilles Heel of the concept is at the interface between the movable switch contact and the stationary contact, which is integral with the printed circuit board. Cold filament current inrush in lighting circuits on "make", and surges from inductive circuits on "break", cause electrical erosion which combines with mechanical wear accumulated during endurance tò tax the ability of the designer and manufacturer to produce an acceptable device for the user. The limitations can be minimized and virtually eliminated by employing a new contact material known as Pressex. Pressex is a rubber-like compound which can be formulated to be an insulator in its free state and a highly efficient conductor when compressed. This paper will discuss Pressex as a switching material, and describe how its use can overcome the limitations of conventional on-circuit switch design. 720514. Designing Clad Metals for Corrosion Control. Robert Baboian, Texas Instruments Inc. The choice of material for a particular application depends on many factors, including cost, availability, appearance, strength, fabricability, and corrosion resis- tance. Frequently, use of a monolithic metal is compro- mised by one or more of its properties. The metallurgical materials systems concept provides a means of designing specific properties into a single composite material. Two or more metals are bonded at the atomic level to form a clad metal that meets the precise requirements of a specific application. In this report technical factors involved in designing corrosion-resistance materials sys- tems are considered. Advantages and limitations are discussed and specific automotive engineering applica- tions are used. 1972 SAE Transactions 720515. Aluminum Striped Stainless Trim for Prevention of Autobody Galvanic Corrosion. Jack M. Beigay and Donald R. Zaremski, Allegheny Ludlum Industries, Inc. The electrochemical action of stainless steel trim in direct electrical contact with autobody steel can promote accelerated rusting of body steel in crevices where paint may be defective or damaged. Rain, snow, and/or road splash containing deicing salts and other contaminants provide the electrolyte. A dissimilar metal battery is created under such conditions resulting in the less noble body steel undergoing rapid galvanic attack. Attempts to prevent this type of corrosion have been investigated in the laboratory and by actual service testing. The various methods evaluated included electrical insulation to interrupt the flow of galvanic currents and the use of a third sacrificial metal which would provide cathodic protection. Among the many third metal systems tested, the aluminum striping concept was proved to be the most practical as well as the most effective for suppressing objectionable galvanic rust of autobody steel. In principle, the aluminum striping development involves a technique to bond continuous stripes of aluminum to production-width coils of finished auto- motive grade, stanless steel strip. The aluminum stripes can be positioned on the stainless steel strip at preselected locations, which ultimately places them on the exterior surface of the return flange (car body contacting surface) of fabricated trim sections. In service, the ideally located stripes of aluminum provide a highly effective system which protects against galvanic attack. The effectiveness of the aluminum striped product in</page><page sequence="76">720517-720523 combating galvanic corrosion has been established by service testing for a number of consecutive winter seasons in the Pittsburgh area and on one of a fleet of test cars which has now been in service in the Detroit area since the fall of 1969. Galvanic corrosion test assemblies have also been exposed on stationary racks along the seacoast in Miami Beach, Fla., and Kure Beach, North Carolina.

The first attempts in corrosion preventative maintenance in vehicle bodies came about in the early 1960s. Air Force TO 36-1-5, Army TM 38-600, Post Office V-5-65 and NAV DOCKS P-300 were quite general in their descrip- tions and defined areas on the vehicle to be rustproofed. The material applied and geographical areas requiring rustproofing were also general. The first materials used were proprietary in some cases; specifications in others. Currently, MIL-STD-1223M is used to specify rust- proofing at the time of procurement rather than after the vehicle has arrived at the point of use. 720518. Fuel Injection and EGR Adjustments on the Renault R17TS. C. Henault, Regie National des Usines Renault. Because of low nitrogen oxide emissions, a version of the Renault 17 TS equipped with a high-performance engine was selected for the American market. This paper discusses problems encountered in adapting a Bosch electronic fuel injection system to a 1600 cm3 engine to meet American standards up to 1974. The principal problems solved were those posed by intermediary operating speeds. This study also gives an idea of the pollution limits which can be obtained with an injection system which incorporates various important adjustment factors. Engine specifications are presented, as are descrip- tions of the electric regulation, electric and pneumatic cold-start, and fuel feeding circuits. The various modi- fications to the engine are also described. 720519. Buick's 1972 Exhaust Gas Recirculation System. A. L. Thompson, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. In 1972 models for sale in California, Buick first employed programmed-metered exhaust gas dilution of the engine intake charge as the major means of reducing oxides of nitrogen (NOJ emission levels. With more stringent NOx emission standards appli- cable nationally to 1973 light duty vehicles, it is probable that similar systems will be more widely used. The major considerations in the decision to use this means of reducing NOx emissions, the design details of the total system, and the field experience to date is discussed. The author concludes with some thought on the limit of usefulness of exhaust gas recirculation for NOx reduction, and further refinements needed to approach that limit. 720520. Analytical Evaluation of a Catalytic Converter System. John L. Harned, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Performance of packed bed type catalytic converters in controlling hydrocarbon (HC) carbon monoxide (CO) mass emissions is investigated using a one-dimensional plug flow math model. Converter operation is explained, and the effects that some gas stream conditions and basic parameter values have on converter emission control performance during warmup are evaluated. It is shown that total mass emissions passed by the converter during warmup can be minimized by maintaining gas mass flow and HC-CO concentrations at low values. Converter warmup performance is highly sensitive to changes in bead diameter and catalyst kinetics, but it is relatively insensitive to changes in bed area/length ratio and bed void fraction. New information is presented dealing with the mod- eling of platinum kinetics, bead temperature stability, and mass and heat transfer j-factors for packed beds. 1972 SA E Transactions 720521. Friction and Wear of Paper Type Wet Friction Elements. A. E. Anderson, Scientific Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A simple model of the engagement process for paper friction materials has been conceived, consisting of squeeze film, squash film, and adhesive contact phases. In support of the model, laboratory test results are presented of paper clutch squeeze and squash film behavior in a new laboratory test fixture. Also scanning electron microscope photographs, profilometer data, and clutch inertia dy- namometer friction and wear results are discussed in the context of the new engagement model. 720522. Friction Behavior of Clutch-Facing Materials: Friction Characteristics in Low-Velocity Slippage. Tsuchio Bunda, Atsunobu Fujikawa and Kazuo Yokoi, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. A study was made of details of friction characteristics of several kinds of clutch-facing materials of resin mold type. With particular attention given to the low-speed slip area, the following was made clear: There exists a thin film on the friction surfaces of facing and mating materials. A thin film is presumed to be a visco-elastic substance which is susceptible to momentum and affects, to a great extent, friction and wear characteristics. 720523. How to Turn a 3-Point Inertia Belt into a Passive Seat-Belt System. Michel J. W. Coenen, Coenen, N. V. This paper discusses how to turn a 3-point inertia belt into a passive seat-belt system. The main objectives of the program were to prove that it would be possible to use existing seat-belt systems to cope with future requirements 151</page><page sequence="77">720524-720533 152 for occupant restraints and that therefore existing anchor points (or at least the existing systems) could be used. The aim was to use only existing techniques in order to reach a high reliability standard and to design a system that also could meet current homologation requirements. A pro- totype was developed with a combination of a 3-point seat belt with running loop with an inertia reel at the central lap belt, in combination with loops around the webbing of the seat belt running along cable-operated tracks. The prototype met all the objectives. 720524. Selection of Elastomeric Materials for Resilient Exterior Body Parts. H. S. Byrne, Mobay Chemical Co. Valance or bumper filler panels as well as other exterior automotive body components of painted elastomers have been used and are being considered more extensively for future models. Three types of materials are the prime candidates: EPDM rubber and thermoplastic or thermo- set urethanes. The parts, however, must perform adequately within the automotive design criteria framework of MVSS regulations, cost, fabrication, appearance, and style. 720525. Volute Spring Bumper System. Richard R. Golze, North American Rockwell Corp. There are numerous engineering solutions to the energy management problem in low-speed vehicle bumper impact situations. This paper covers a North American Rockwell volute spring energy storage assembly. Selection of a system involves price, performance, installation, weather- ability, reliability, etc. Extensive tests - pendulum corner impact, barrier, and pendulum - were carried out and showed that the volute spring assembly on a test vehicle withstood more than 100 impacts without evidence of failure. 720526. The Cold Cranking Simulator and British Engine Cranking Studies. R. Hollinghurst, Mobil Oil Co. Ltd., K. Marsden, Esso Chemicals Ltd., R. A. Wright, Perkins Engines Ltd.; and C. E. S. Hackett, Mobil Oil Co. Ltd. This paper presents a summary of studies initiated by the British Technical Council to examine the repeatability and reproducibility of cold crank simulator results obtained on European cross-graded engine oils used in gasoline and diesel engines, and also to relate the results obtained to actual cranking speeds. The study of various components of engine cranking resistance on low-temperature starting behavior confirms that only those having oil viscosity dependence are related to temperature. Results obtained on engine startability and the cranking of used lubricants show significant increases in cranking speed as a result of fuel dilution, but show the converse for high insoluble contents (up to 10%). An advantage in cold startability is shown for the low end of the 20W specification compared to the high, but magnitude depends very much on the individual engine. Good correlation was obtained between the cold crank simulator results and the cranking tests on the gasoline engine at + 10 F and diesel engine at -10 F, using the various selected oils, including the widely used 20W/50 multigrades. 720528. (P-40) Marketing the Flying Truck. R. Cruse Lewis, Burlington Industries, Inc. The time is now for shipper and air carrier to maximize profitability through extensive employment of the air freight concept. Better understanding by both parties of the Total Materials Management theory, that is, the tradeoffs to air cost, is the key to vastly improved utilization of the Flying Truck. 720531. (P-40) Air Freight Pays Off in Profits. L. D. Richardson, Magna Alloys &amp; Research Pty. Ltd., Australia. Distance and time were the two obstacles baring the achievement of the export marketing objectives of a young Australian company, Magna Alloys &amp; Research Pty. Ltd. The airplane and a unique use of air freight provided the solution to overcoming these obstacles. This paper shows how air freight was used as a marketing tool, the economics and operation of the company's air freight program, and the results achieved through the imple- mentation of this program. 1972 SAE Transactions 720532. (P-40) The Day's News Goes to Market on Night Flights. Edward F. McDougal, American Banker Inc. Publishers are presently facing rapidly increasing mailing charges from the U.S. Postal Service, while at the same time experiencing a deterioration of service in longer and longer delivery times. This paper describes one publisher's solution to the problem - a combination of air freight, truck and the Postal Service. The newspapers are trucked to the airport for shipment to eight distribution points throughout the United States, and then trucked to the Post Offices for mailing. The system has resulted in 72% of the total circulation reaching subscribers on the publi- cation date, 26% on dateline plus 1, and 2% on dateline plus 2 - a vast improvement over the previous system of mailing from a single Post Office located where the newpapers are printed. 1972 SAE Transactions 720533. (P-40) Handling Intermodal and Interline Con- tainers. Gregory V. Schultz, Factory Magazine. Containerization was the first step in a globally stan- dardized physical distribution system. It precipitated a system of intermodal unit-loads and modular packaging dimensions known as Total Pack. As part of this system, reasons are presented why the air-cargo mode should adopt an intermodal unit-load 54.00 X 45.00 in (1372 X 1143 mm). Usage of intermodal and interline con-</page><page sequence="78">720535-720544 tainers is traced through the entire distribution system, including solutions to key problems. 1972 SA E Transactions 720535. (P-40) Terminal Handling Environment for Noncontainerized Freight. E. A. LaMarre, Unit- ed Air Lines, Inc. The air freight terminal has evolved from its beginnings as a by-product industry. It evolved as an unwanted child. The first terminals were patchwork copies of trucking terminals with modifications, but through many trials and errors, they have become the diverse, compatible, flexible series of systems that they are today. Air cargo terminals, even within the same system, are largely autonomous. This is as it should be. The terminals are individually keyed to the needs of their local shippers and their freight. Similarities exist, naturally, but the systems and the extent to which they are employed differ from station to station. Any attempt to impose uniform operating conditions on the various stations would impair their ability to respond to their local customers. 720537. (P-40) Removing Roadblocks from International Customs Clearance. John B. O'Loughlin, U.S. Bureau of Customs. The United States Bureau of Customs is working through international organizations to further its policy of facil- itating the flow of cargo in international trade while interdicting the movement of contraband. These organ- izations, with United States participation, seek to har- monize customs procedures worldwide by developing international conventions and preparing recommenda- tions to member states. The Bureau also is moving toward an automated merchandise processing system and is adapting its procedures to rapid technological advances in land and water transportation in the fields of containerization and the movement of cargo by lighters carried aboard seagoing vessels. 1972 SA E Transactions 720540. (P-40) Reducing International Air Freight Costs - The Role of the Forwarder. Holt W. Webster, Airborne Freight Corp. The air freight forwarding industry is assuming more and more complex duties and creating innovative services at the same time that it is providing customers with dollar-saving "trade-off" opportunities. The maturing industry has begun the air shipment of garments on hangers, and has launched the Overland Common Point (O.C.P.) Tariff for combining ocean transportation with connecting domestic air service. Forwarders have crusaded for greater container use, and, now, air carriers are beginning to offer incentives for containerized shipments. The industry also has assumed greater single-carrier responsibilities, developed sophis- ticated world-wide communications systems, and created simplified billing procedures. 720541. (P-41) Transit Planning in Washington, D.C. Past, Present, and Future. G. V. Wickstrom, Metropolitan Washington Council of Govern- ments. Existing transit services in the Washington, D.C. area are faced with increasing costs and diminishing patronage, resulting in declining service. Top priority tasks are to provide for the improvement of existing bus services, planning for integrated and efficient bus operation before, during and after construction of the rail rapid transit system; and initiation of new and expanded passenger and service improvements. Future transit planning must recognize, however, that land use and travel patterns dictate the choice of travel mode. In fact, highway improvements will also be required in order to serve the land development and travel generated by the transit lines themselves. 720542. (P-41) Cost Minimization in New Urban Trans- portation Systems. Donald L. Flynn and Theodore K. Martin, RMC, Inc. The objective of the study was to explore the potential for reducing the costs of new urban mass transportation systems. The significance of major components of the capital investment cost was determined for guideway systems. Specific methods of reducing the cost of the most significant components were identified and examined in detail: economies of scale in construction, reductions in the requirement for guideway s by utilizing a dual-mode vehicle, eliminating tunnels by using super-elevated guideways, new tunneling, joint purchase of vehicles by several systems, and reductions in initial vehicle purchases by reductions in the maintenance float. It is concluded that there appears to be no opportunity to dramatically reduce the cost of urban transportation. All potential reductions are on the order of 5-10%. The most promising areas for reducing costs are related to implementing institutional procedures to take advantage of economies of scale and the use of existing technology. New technological developments, with the exception of tunnel excavations, do not appear to offer much potential for cost reduction. However, the dual-mode vehicle has a significant potential for reducing costs by eliminating much of the need for costly guideway construction. 720544. (P-41) Transit Planning in Small Urban Areas. Littleton C. MacDorman, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into issues of furnishing transit service in small urban areas and to suggest certain important elements of planning frequently overlooked in the implementation of transit programs. Further, the paper outlines suggested areas for improve- ment which are needed in order that viable and financially feasible transit service may be provided to smaller communities. In this paper, transit planning refers to public transportation planning, and considers any alter- native which delivers reliable service with reasonable cost 153</page><page sequence="79">720545-720559 154 to both users and the community at large; small urban areas in this discussion refers to communities between 50,000 and 500,000 population. 720545. (P-41) Transportation Systems Criteria - Urban Corridor Rail Systems. Walter P. Trzaskoma, ENSCO, Inc. Industrialized nations confronted with environmental, socioeconomic, and populace mobility problems, resulting from urbanization of their respective societies, are seeking solutions via revitalization of their rail systems. This paper presents an overview of urban corridor rail revival in different nations and points to similarities in such areas as service, economics, design, and speed. 720546. (P-41) Intermodal Transportation Systems. Benton H. Elliott and Philip S. Noble, General Electric Co. Economic forces and technological developments have been combining in recent years to create a revolution in cargo transportation known as containerization. However, this is only one manifestation of the dramatic growth in Intermodal Transportation as a whole. The underlying causes, existing state-of-the-art, and future developments of this phenomenon are discussed. 720548. (P-41) Who Benefits from Corporate Innovation in Freight Transport - if Anyone. Nicholas Bachko, U. S. Lines, Inc. Innovation in oceangoing freight transportation is paying benefits to the general public, the shipper, the consignee, to direct labor, and to associated industries and their labor. Government, too, is sharing in the fruits of innovation. However, ocean transportation, which con- stitutes the prime investors, has been denied a fair share of the benefits and has, in fact, been exposed to greater risk when the operation is interrupted for any reason. 720549. (P-41) Prototype Planning Experience with PRT. Samy E. G. Elias, West Virginia University; and Lawrence Deibel, Morgantown PRT System. This paper describes the planning experience with the Morgantown PRT. The University offered an ideal site for the implementation of a PRT. Previous work in the field of transportation by West Virginia University along with a national and local need for a new transit concept helped set the stage for early planning. Early contacts were made with the University, the City, and the community to gain support while the project staff coordinated with all levels of government. A feasibility study was conducted to evaluate the alternatives for the Morgantown PRT. Systems Analysis was used to reduce the list of alter- natives and discern the best system for the Morgantown situation. Coordination and timely cooperation was emphasized among members of the design team and between the design team and the community. The project recognized that social, economical, political constraints play an important role in planning. Some of these constraints had particular application in Morgantown. The project at- tempted to anticipate and satisfy these constraints and their interactions on the PRT system. 720551. (P-41) Personal Rapid Transit Planning - The Urban Planning Director's Viewpoint. City of Omaha. An urban planning director enumerates seven community problems which a Personal Rapid Transit developer may encounter and suggests procedures to overcome these problems. The use of expanded interprofessional teams, together with recent city planning techniques to ensure citizen, business and political participation during system definition and promotional stages of PRT development, is recommended. Potential benefits which might accrue to various sectors of an urban area following installation of a well located PRT system are discussed, along with suggestions for engendering support for the PRT program. 720553. (P-41) The Development of Personal Rapid Transit. Albert J. Sobey, TASA, Inc. This paper reviews some of the considerations which led to the development of the concept of personal rapid transit. It includes a discussion of the possible devel- opment of the market and indicates that even with extensive use of conventional rail and bus transit systems, new and innovative systems (such as Personal Rapid Transit) will be required to meet the overall needs of the urban areas. The development requirements of PRT systems, both technically and ecnomically, are discussed and examples are included to illustrate the comparative performance of PRT, bus, and rail systems in a wide corridor and in a large urban area. The institutional problems which will influence the ultimate development of the systems are also reviewed. 1972 SAE Transactions 720556. (P-41) Transportation Systems Invention and Innovation. W. L. Garrison, University of Pitts- burgh. While there is a high level of invention and innovation in transportation activities, there is little innovation suppor- tive of solutions to systems problems. Impediments to such innovation may include resistance of transportation to those innovations that result in system change, the resistance of the environment of transportation systems to systems change, lack of client-sponsors for changes, and lack of systems knowledge. These impediments might be circumvented by developments such as government acting as the client-sponsor for certain types of innovation, better coupling of innovators to monetary payoffs, and the creation of experimentation environments within which innovations might be tested. 720559. (P-41) Nuclear Submarine Tankers. L. R.

The description of a nuclear submarine tanker of high deadweight tonnage specifically designed for Arctic oil transport service is presented, including discussion of salient features of such a proposed design. 720560. (P-41) Transportation of Oil From the Arctic - The Trans Alaska Pipeline. E. L. Patton, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. A group of seven oil companies has formed the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. to design, construct, operate and maintain the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The total pipeline will be approximately 789 miles long, some 641 miles of which will be across federal lands. The project will include pump stations, camp sites for use during construction, airfields for use during both construction and operation of the line, a communication system, and material sites for construction and access roads. The terminal site at Valdez will consist of a tank farm and dock facilities from which ocean-going tankers will transport crude oil to markets. Prior to construction of the pipeline north of the Yukon River, a road will be built for access and the movement of equipment, materials and personnel during pipeline construction activity. This road (to become a part of the State of Alaska Highway System) will be approximately 373 miles in length, of which about 365 miles will traverse public lands. Of the approximately 586,000 square miles of land in Alaska, the project will utilize less than 0.001% of the total. The project is now more than a year behind its original schedule as a result of a court injunction stemming from the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 720561. (P-41) Arctic Transportation. Sydney Wire, Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. With the discovery of a major oil deposit on the North Slope of Alaska in 1968, extensive investigations were carried out to determine the feasibility of transporting the oil by ice breaking tankers to markets on the East and West Coasts. Because of the economic necessity to produce this oil on a year-round basis, the efforts were directed toward the design of a self-sufficient Arctic vessel able to cope with the ice conditions without assistance from ice breakers. Some of the major features of such a tanker are discussed and compared with similar features of standard vessels operating in other areas. 720562. (P-41) Controlled Depth Submerged Barge. John D. Sudbury, Continental Oil Co. This paper describes a concept for hauling cargo in a towed vessel at controlled depths beneath the ocean surface. A system is proposed for hauling crude oil from the North Slope of Alaska through the Northwest Passage and to the East Coast of the U.S. Specifications for a 189,000 shp ice breaking tug and a 250,000 ton barge with necessary controls are detailed. The application of this towed underwater barge concept to other transportation is presented. 720564. (P-41) Ship to Ship Lightening. A. F. Dickson, Shell International Marine Ltd. The paper sets out the known history as far as the author's company is concerned on operations involving the transfer of oil on the high seas. It then deals with the large-scale lightening operations being undertaken by Shell in North West Europe and reaches the conclusion that these operations demonstrate that, given suitable shelter, lightening as a regular operation can be a perfectly satisfactory way of reducing the draft of incoming large tankers to enable them to enter restricted ports. Mention is made of the value of specialized lightening ships when mounting salvage operations for stranded tankers. 720565. (P-41) The Single Buoy Mooring System (For the Offshore Loading and/or Unloading of Oil and Solids in a Liquid Suspension Form). Bernard Frankel, IMODCO Inc. There are tremendous opportunities for the economic development of great mineral wealth from parts of the world presently inaccessible by the simple and effective media of offshore single buoy mooring systems. The first single buoy mooring system ever used in a slurry transfer operation is described in this paper. 720566. (P-41) Transportation of Iron Ore by Slurry. Hugh C. Downer, Marcona Corp. Transportation of solid materials by pipeline is, of course, not a new development. In the 1950s a 108-mile pipeline was constructed from Cadiz, Ohio, to Cleveland trans- porting approximately 1 million tons per year of coal to a public utility plant. This line was discontinued in the 1960s, having served its purpose of forcing a reduction in the rail rate. A 72-mile pipeline is in operation trans- porting 800 tons of gilsonite per day from a mine in northeastern Utah to a refinery in western Colorado. Other applications are, a 14-mile copper concentrates pipeline in Chile and several pipelines of up to 16 miles in length transporting uranium bearing gold tailings in South Africa. Other recent additions to this list would be the 273-mile Black Mesa coal pipeline serving the Four Corners generating plant and the 54-mile Savage River, Tasmania, iron ore pipeline. Additionally, development of the pelletizing process which transforms relatively low grade iron ore into high iron content pellets for blast furnace burden requires pipeline transportation of fine ground ore in slurry form throughout the process. 720567. (P-41) The Transportation Needs of Urban Systems. Britton Harris, University of Pennsyl- vania. An attempt is made to show that a transportation system as such is too "open" for sound planning, and that the 155</page><page sequence="81">720568-720572 156 larger interaction system (including the users of trans- portation and their bases at home and work) must be considered. This requires a detailed understanding of micro-behavior, social goals, and public policy alterna- tives in a wide range of situations. 720568. (P-41) The Mix of Demands. Damian J. Kulash, The Urban Institute. There are two general approaches to travel demand analysis currently being suggested: the widely used "Urban Transportation Planning process," and the use of "Direct Demand Models." Their general forms, strengths, and weaknesses are sketched briefly, and some problems common to both approaches are investigated. These include the limitations imposed by the single period, static, partial equilibrium nature of the analysis, and the problems raised by the possible existence of multiple equilibria within that framework. The paper advocates research in several directions which would help to alleviate the problems in current procedures, and which also promises to yield some policy guidelines as research progresses. These are the inves- tigation of peaking patterns and the forces behind them, the quantitative representation of more dimensions of traveler experience than are currently being analyzed, the analysis of different socio-economic stratifications, the inclusion of auto ownership decisions into the travel demand prediction process, and the development and comparison of alternative structural formulations for determining passenger demand. It is suggested that, for the time being, analyses along the proposed lines should be conducted in connection with specific, relatively small-scale transport projects as opposed to a modeling effort which attempts to tackle all of the analysis problems simultaneously. 720569. (P-41) Special Facilities Needs. Lloyd M. Pernela, University of Pittsburgh. Arguments are put forth that the current urban trans- portation planning process is failing to address itself to the causal factors and elements of the urban environment that create the demand for travel. The approach to urban transportation analysis and development is argued to be best done through work on special facilities. Special facilities are defined as the basic building blocks of life in the urban environment. The reason for the study of special facilities needs is that the true determinants of travel behavior can be best established at this level. Using trip-aggregate models behavior specific to special facilities is suppressed. The success of disaggregate (individual- based) models in modeling modal choice behavior is extended to the analysis of special facilities. The need for policy-sensitive models further exemplifies special facil- ities models. 720570. (P-41) A New Perception of Urban Transpor- tation: A Federal Responsibility. William I. Goodman, U.S. Department of Transportation. This paper discusses the dramatic change that has taken place in the urban transportation concept. The impor- tance ascribed to social, political, and aesthetic concerns by the transportation planning function has resulted in greater sensitivity on the part of transportation planners to nonphysical elements. Aesthetic and design principles are being identified and are becoming more important in fitting transportation facilities into communities, without disrupting the natural environment. Also discussed are the steps taken by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Environment and Urban Systems to institute a design and development expertise that would be more sensitive to the aesthetic objectives in the metropolitan transportation planning process. The need for reforms within the decision-making process are also discussed. Among them: the need to sort out the appropriate level of government for each trans- portation function, better coordination and integration of various kinds of planning grants to facilitate multimodal planning, more citizen participation, and development of citizen constituency for transit and for improved trans- portation planning. 720571. (P-41) Regulation or Deregulation - Interstate Commerce Commission. Fritz R. Kahn, Inter- state Commerce Commission. The financial difficulties of many of the nation's railroads and some of the other surface carriers properly cannot be attributed to the regulatory scheme embodied in the Interstate Commerce Act and its administration by the Interstate Commerce Commission. If, as many observers seem to feel, the transportation enterprises' difficulties stem from a lack of managerial initiative and exploitation of competitive conditions, that inertia does not derive from the statute. Despite widespread misconceptions to the contrary, the Interstate Commerce Act from its inception has been structured to deal with conditions of competition and contemplates that the response be initiated and effectuated by the carriers' managements with little or no interference by the regulatory agen- cy-whether in the areas of their franchises, rates or finances. In short, the case for deregulation or the massive revision of the existing regulatory laws has not been made. 720572. (P-41) Regulation or Deregulation - Labor. William H. Dempsey, National Railway Labor Conference. The thesis of this paper is that the existing scheme of government regulation of labor-management relations in the railroad industry does not sufficiently protect the public interest in two respects. First, the acknowledged interest of the public in preventing crippling strikes has not been served adequately, as is evidenced by the frequency of ad hoc Congressional intervention in recent years. Second, the prevalence of economically irrational contract provisions injures the public just as surely, even though more indirectly, as strikes. Some form of com- pulsory arbitration is the only answer.</page><page sequence="82">720573-720581 720573. (P-41) Regulation versus Deregulation - Its Effect on Private Carriage. George J. Agamem- non, Burlington Industries, Inc. Total deregulation is not in the public interest. Effective control is mandatory but updating of regulatory practices, procedures and concepts is past due.

This paper outlines methods of shipping automobiles to prevent such damage. Part 2 provides the engineering principals relating to the shipping method endorsed in part 1. 720578. (P-41) A Status Report on VTOL Short-Haul Systems. Merrick W. Hellyar, Sikorsky Aircraft, Div., United Aircraft Corp. Serious interest in VTOL systems for short-haul appli- cations can be traced to concept-definition efforts in 1967-68. In January 1968, Sikorsky published the results of a year-long market research project that suggested a very large market for intercity VTOL equipment, and similar conclusions were indicated by the commercial project organizations at Boeing and Lockheed. Encour- aged by the CAB's calling for a Northeast Corridor VTOL Investigation, the three manufacturers moved from con- cept-definition to project-development and varying de- grees of preliminary design. What emerged from Phase I of the CAB's investi- gation was an endorsement of the manufacturers' posi- tions that a VTOL or STOL system was both feasible economically and technically and necessary to serve the forecasted passenger demand in the Northeast Corridor. It was hoped that unanswered questions would be resolved in Phase II of the Northeast Corridor Case, now scheduled for hearings in the spring of 1972. This paper traces the evolution of the VTOL short- haul concept from its origins in 1967 to the present. It shows how design proposals have become more responsive to the evolving system and economic requirements of the potential operating airlines. For example, Sikorsky is preparing a two-phase program beginning with the readily available 46-passenger S-65-40 helicopter, and followed by introduction of the 100-passenger S-200 compound air- craft in 1980. The VTOL market potential is discussed, as is projected acceptance of the VTOL short-haul system in the Northeast Corridor and the principal routes of western Europe. 720579.

Results show that such systems can be used effectively, from a performance standpoint, in a VTOL or STOL mode of operation. A supplementary assessment of potential applications of such vehicles is examined, with a brief look at economic factors and an examination of missions for which they might be effectively used. 720581.

The operation, braking, and parking of the air cushion landing system will be explained. The advantages of this type of landing system over conventional wheeled landing gear will be examined in relation to civil aircraft applications such as high density, low density short-haul transportation systems, and STOL operations.

(P-41) The Role of the Heavy Lift Helicopter. E. E. Gustafson, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Of all the problems inherent in transportation, none are so vexing or difficult of solution as the interfaces between different modes of transportation. This is particularly so in situations where facilities are not in being. Examples are replenishment of isolated villages or stations in remote areas, the emplacement of assemblies or subassemblies on construction sites or buildings, lumbering in ecologically delicate or unstable areas, mineral and oil exploration in undeveloped areas, the electric transmission tower con- struction industry and the factory built housing industry. This paper will describe the unique capabilities of the Skycrane configured heavy-lift helicopter, report on the concept development work that has been accomplished in the commercial and industrial fields over the past few years, and consider new applications that have not yet been field tested but that appear to have the potential of alleviating or solving existing or forseeable difficult transportation and construction problems. 720586. (P-42) Construction Economics and Community Impact. Ernest E. Dean, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. A discussion of construction economics and community impacts of the new Dallas/Fort Worth Airport is pre- sented. Planning and design criteria and a description of construction of the airport development are presented and serve as a background for the information pertaining to economics and related community impacts. To evaluate the economic effect of construction, two pilots are presented and analyzed. The first plot pertains to the commitments and cash flow of construction funds as a function of time. The second plot pertains to the number of construction personnel on the airport site as a function of time. Personnel levels and the construction costs are used as a basis for analyzing the impact on the economy of communities served by the airport. It is concluded that the construction of new, large- scale airports has major impacts on the economy and life style of communities in the vicinity of the airport. Since an airport is one of the catalysts necessary for continued economic growth of a region, the construction phase can act as the first step in a long-term growth pattern which continues during the operational phase. 720587. (P-42) The Airport Environment Economic Im- pact on the Community. George Howard, The Port of New York Authority. There have been a few economic studies which have attempted to identify and quantify the benefit of an airport to the regional economy. One of these studies was performed by C-E-I-R, Inc., in 1960 for The Port of New York Authority. C-E-I-R estimated that in 1959, 121,000 employees earned $683,000,000 in the New York-New Jersey Metropolitan Region because of air transportation. Projecting the relationships to 1971, it is estimated that employment generated by air transportation last year mounted to 190,000 with earnings of about $2 billion. Similar studies are reported for the Los Angeles Inter- national Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Air- port. Such studies have not, for the most part, attempted to evaluate the economic dependency of industry on air transportation. The benefits of air transportation cannot be adequately assessed simply by the multiplier effect or input-output analysis. Environmental studies such as those done by the Commission on the Third London Airport and by the National Academy of Sciences on the extension of Kennedy into Jamaca Bay have been more comprehensive in their analysis of environmental costs. The decision to build a new airport or expand an existing one is an increasingly difficult one, involving a complex mixture of institutional, environmental and economic issues. This makes it all the more imperative for the evaluators of these major public projects to give full weight to all the identifiable benefits and costs so that planning decisions can be made rationally with full knowledge of the consequences. 720588. (P-42) Area Survey of Airport Environs Eco- nomic Reactions Present and Future. George J. Bean, Hillsborough County Aviation Authority. Airports have a definite impact on their community environs. Past impact of the airport on the community can readily be measured through analysis of historic economic data which has been assembled in the individual com- munity. Measurement of present economic impact in- volves the overlying of airport growth data on that of the general community surrounding the airport. Measurement of future airport economic impact on its environs must deal in large part with the intangible qualities of surveys and forecasts relating to the community's continued development. The highest degree of direct economic support given to the community starts within the airport itself. The secondary level of economic impact covers those areas directly adjoining the airport, and finally, the impact can be measured in terms of the airport's interplay with the community, expressed as the entire trade which the airport serves. 720589. (P-42) O'Hare International Airport: What It Means to Chicago. William E. Downes, Jr., Commissioner of Aviation, City of Chicago. This paper shows how an "Airport City", Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, has acted as a magnet and catalyst for industrial, commerical and residential growth in the Chicago area. Land surrounding the airport has appre- ciated 250 times the 1942 rate. O'Hare is the sixth leading</page><page sequence="84">720593-720601 employer in the Chicago area, though Chicago is the second most populated consolidated area in the U.S. Only three of fourteen communities near O'Hare had greater disposable incomes than those generated by air trans- portation at O'Hare in 1970. 720593. (P-42) Problems and Issues for Short-Haul Air Transportation. Joseph F. Vittek, Jr., Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology. The problems of developing an efficient short-haul air system are not primarily technical, but economic and political. The key issues are whether the community will accept new and expanded air facilities, what standards of service the passengers will demand and how the system will evolve. The solutions recommended are national in scope and require the federal government to take a leading role. 720594. (P-42) Forecasting Air Service Demand. George W. James, Air Transport Association of Amer- ica. In 1967 the airline industry embarked on a new fore- casting project - an Airport Demand Forecast Study to determine future traffic demands at individual airports as well as future nationwide air traffic. The study, involving many complex problems, has recently been completed. It will be used for airport planning purposes at major hubs across the country. The study forecasts demand far enough into the future to enable needed airport devel- opments to be accomplished in time. 720597. (P-42) The Airport - A Center of Economic Gravity. Joseph A. Foster, Dept. of Aviation, City of Houston. The airport as an instrumentality of air transport services performs a function of substantial economic importance to the community and country it serves. It provides the facility that gives business and industrial communities access to a national and international air transport network that links cities and nations together. The economic impact of a major airport, both on neighboring real estate values and on the economy of the communities it serves, is quite substantial. An active commercial airport truly becomes a center of economic gravity within its market area. 720598. (P-42) The Development of Propulsion Systems for Air Transport. Harry Pearson, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. The paper briefly reviews the evolution of modern aero engines and analyzes the forces which motivate continued technical development, especially the interaction with growth in traffic and aircraft size. The contribution of improved propulsion systems to the economics and regularity of air transport are examined with particular reference to developments during the past decade. There is some discussion of the environmental factors partic- ularly noise - raised by civil aviation, the progress already made to deal with them and the possibilities for the future. The overall benefits of powerplant technical development particularly as they affect the general and travelling public are summarized. Examples are drawn from both the U.S. and European scene. 1972 SA E Transactions 720599. (P-42) How Will New Engines Contribute to Better Air Transportation. Richard C. Mulready, United Aircraft Corp. Engine technology has played a major role in establishing today's modern commercial transport aircraft as a vital part of the world transportation system. This paper discusses the significant advancements that have been made in air transportation and the contribution the engine has made to these advancements. Potential future im- provements that could benefit the customer, community and operator are examined and new transport aircraft and engine possibilities indicated. The concern over the social and ecological compatibility of air transportation with the community will be a significant factor in future transport aircraft and engine design requirements. The impact of these demands on new engines and advanced technology requirements will be discussed. 720600. (P-42) Aircraft Engines - A Vanguard of Air Transportation Progress. E. E. Hood, Jr., Com- mercial Engine Div., General Electric Co. This paper covers the impact of the gas turbine on safety, reliability, and airline profitability and the impact of the jet aircraft on international trade and development. Historically, new aircraft engines have led to new and more productive airplanes. New technology has enabled the development of more efficient and quieter engines with better materials and manufacturing techniques. The economics of this is discussed. Air transportation progress is benefitting the airlines, national interests, and all in our society, including the neighbors of our airports. 720601. (P-44) Economic Forecasts and Transportation Planning. Howard C. Gary and Kenneth O. Nilsen, Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton. This paper examines and challenges various established theories of transportation economics. The sad state of our transportation systems prompts this examination. Pol- lution caused by mass transportation, the high cost, inadequacy, and inefficiency of these systems have all been considered, and combined together indicate the need for improvement. Several areas the authors feel should be more carefully scrutinized are: acceptance of the so-called beneficial impact of transportation, selection of analysis periods of appropriate durations for purposes of project evaluation, the spillover effects of any transportation project, and a realization that transportation planning should not as- sume that "tomorrow will be just like yesterday." 159</page><page sequence="85">720603-720612 160 720603. (P-44) Transport Demand Forecasts and Simu- lation. Thomas Lambie and Martin L. Miller, CLM/Systems, Inc. Selected techniques for forecasting transportation demand are described and evaluated. Techniques discussed com- prise judgment, including Delphi techniques, "other forecasts", historical extrapolation, and modelling ~ conventional regression and econometric models. Simu- lation as it applies to evaluating large-scale transport facilities is discussed, using airports as an example. 720604. (P-44) Status Report on Locomotives as Sources of Air Pollution. Max Ephraim, Jr., Electro- Motive Div., General Motors Corp. The diesel electric locomotive as a source of gaseous emissions is reviewed. Locomotive operation is outlined to provide an understanding of diesel engine application, operation, and controls. Methods of evaluating gaseous emissions are offered for consideration as industry standards. Present-day exhaust emission levels are pre- sented. Specific recommendations are offered to the locomotive manufacturers, the railroads, and to gov- ernmental regulating bodies to effect improved exhaust emission levels. 720605. (P-44) Characteristic Emissions of Heavy Class Intercity Trucks. Mark Sherbinsky, International Harvester Co. The heaviest class of intercity trucks is examined using the 1967 Census of Transportation to establish a represen- tative sample of vehicles with truck-miles as the major delineator. Representative road types and vehicle loading factors are selected. Computer simulation of the vehicle and road is used to establish histograms of percent engine load versus engine rpm. The above is then combined with modal emission levels to allow projection on a weighted truck-mile basis, to the entire intercity population of this class vehicle. Heavy class is defined as over 26,000 lb gvw. 720606. (P-44) Considerations in Reducing Truck Emis- sions in Metropolitan Areas Through the Im- provement of Goods-Movement. Irving J. Rubin, Ford Motor Co. A reduction in truck emissions in metropolitan areas can be accomplished through the installation of pollution control devices, and the more efficient utilization of trucks in the movement of goods. This paper discusses the government-mandated standards for truck emission con- trol, and reviews the various methods employed or suggested for improving the efficiency of trucks - such as the "off-hours" delivery system - as well as alternative vehicle modes for moving goods. The conclusion is that improving the efficiency of trucks can reduce congestion and costs to both truckers and shippers, and, at the same time, it also can reduce pollution. 720607. (P-44) The Environment and The Bus. Robert E. Field, Truck &amp; Coach Div., General Motors Corp. The ecology of our environment has recently been of great concern to all of us. In the bus business, we have gone from horse drawn carriages, to electric, to steam power to diesel to obtain an efficient, clean operating vehicle. A great deal of effort has been expended in determining the components of the emissions of the diesel engine. Great strides have been made in reducing these emissions. GMC Truck &amp; Coach has developed and released an Envi- ronmental Improvement Program that reduces smoke to the invisible range and meets Federal standards for HC, CO and NOx. Odor also is eliminated as a problem. 720609. (P-44) Digging into Air Pollution Problems -- An Earthmover's Viewpoint. R. D. Henderson, Cat- erpillar Tractor Co. This paper comments on the status of emission regula- tions; provides estimates of emissions from earthmoving vehicles based on Caterpillar information and compares this with diesel powered off-highway machinery based on Bureau of Mines data; suggests that simple emission test procedures may suffice for the great variety of equipment used in the construction industry if standards are established; and proposes that nonproductive testing to prove conformance to standards be minimized. 720610. (P-44) The Impact of Aircraft Emissions Upon Air Quality. Melvin Piatt and E. Karl Bastress, Northern Research and Engineering Corp. Aircraft emissions and their impact upon air quality have been studied at four major air carrier airports and two general aviation airports. Predicted concentrations of nonmethane hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide due to aircraft emissions alone have been found to exceed their respective national ambient air quality standards. In the case of nitrogen dioxide, aircraft emissions contribute significantly to excessive concentrations. On the other hand, aircraft contributions to excessive concentrations of particulates and sulfur dioxide are small in areas to which the public has "reasonable access." 1972 SA E Transactions 720611. (P-44) Monitoring and Modeling of Airport Air Pollution. D. M. Rote, I. T. Wang, J. Pratapas and Lois Leffler, Argonne National Laboratory; and Glen Cato, Celesco Industries. The airport air quality monitoring program conducted at both O'Hare and Orange County Airports is discussed and preliminary results are presented. Aircraft and related ground vehicular data are presented along with a sum- mary of engine emissions. These data are discussed and their use in the activity simulation models is described. The models used for activity simulation and calculation of air quality are described briefly. 1972 SA E Transactions 720612. (P-44) Estimation of Engine Emissions at Alti- tude Through Ground Testing. William T. Westfield, Federal Aviation Administration.</page><page sequence="86">720615-720622 An afterburning turbofan engine was operated over a range of simulated altitudes and Mach numbers to determine if correlation existed between static sea level emissions and those at altitudes and flight speeds. Data were taken at a point about 27 ft downstream of the exhaust nozzle exit and on the centerline of flow. No apparent effect of altitude or flight speed on emissions, either gaseous or particle, was observed. 720615. (P-44) Future of Gasoline Engines. Albert G. Lucas, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp.; and George W. Niepoth, Engi- neering Staff, General Motors Corp. The present gasoline engine is examined against the requirements for an automotive powerplant such as performance, economy, operational factor and availability considerations. New factors of emissions and noise are shown to modify the basic requirements. The effect of these factors on future gasoline engines is discussed. 720616. (P-44) Prospects for Alternate Powerplants. John J. Brogan, Environmental Protection Agency. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 require that new model automobiles of 1976 and later meet stringent exhaust emission standards. The technical difficulties appearing in 'clean-up' of the conventional automobile engine require that alternate engines be developed in the event that the conventional engine cannot be made to meet the standards. Although the alternates cannot be mass produced by 1976, prototype engine development and demonstration by that date may lead to decisions to mass produce one or more in the early eighties. Features of the major alternate engine systems are reviewed, projections are made of the prospects of each as a replacement for the conventional engine. The introduction to production of rotary otto cycle systems by the mid-1970s, gas turbines by the early 1980s and high performance all-electric systems by the late 1980s is projected in this paper. 720617. (P-44) Future Automotive Fuels. J. C. Ellis, Shell Oil Co. The national concern over air quality and the under- standing of the role of the internal combustion engine powered passenger car as a contributor of atmospheric pollutants has imposed new design criteria upon both the automobile manufacturer and the petroleum refiner. For the passenger car engine builder these criteria have been specified by the emission standards required by the Clean Air Amendments of 1970. With certain exceptions, gasolines for these low-emitting passenger cars have not yet been specified, nor have their required quality and performance characteristics been clearly spelled out. This paper attempts to judge the influence of emission control requirements on future gasoline quality. Lead antiknocks, hydrocarbon compositions and gross physical properties are among the factors considered, and an effort is made to quantify the effects of changes in these characteristics on emissions and to estimate their impact on the industry. It is concluded that future automotive fuels, that is, fuels that will be produced for future emission controlled vehicles, will be a blend of liquid hydrocarbons, free of lead alkyl antiknocks and other catalyst poisons, and with hydrocarbon composition and volatility modestly adjusted to provide optimum emissions control at lowest overall system cost. 720619. (P-44) Automotive Emissions ~ What Can Uni- versities Do? David V. Ragone, Dartmouth College. Universities, in the process of pursuing their classical roles, the generation and dissemination of knowledge, can contribute significantly to the resolution of automotive air pollution problems if they recognize problem-oriented, as well as discipline-oriented approaches to education. In addition to the classical roles, both faculty and students can contribute as unbiased, but informed, third parties who can validate technical arguments in controversial areas for the public. 720620. (P-44) The Future of Regulatory Requirements Related to Automotive Emissions. Eric O. Stork, Environmental Protection Agency. Federal regulatory involvement with the automobile industry, automotive emissions of air pollutants in particular, is the main emphasis of this paper. Govern- ment concern with automotive air pollution is traced from the early 1950s to the present. The present document will focus on the process by which the government brings to bear the well being and concerns of the American people in relation to automobile-caused air pollution. 720621. (P-44) Aircraft Noise and the Airlines. William B. Becker, Air Transport Association of Amer- ica. The U.S. airlines deep concern over aircraft noise and the abatement thereof is described. The three basic ap- proaches are set forth: reducing noise at the source, operational procedures, and control of land use in the airport vicinity. Emphasis is placed on the need for much larger government funding for aircraft noise research and development. 1972 SA E Transactions 720622. (P-44) Aircraft Noise as a Continuing National Problem. Lloyd Hinton, Metropolitan Aircraft Sound Abatement Council. The history of the aircraft noise problem is presented using many references to particularly important studies. Emphasis is placed upon the similarity of expert opinions during twenty years of research for measures needed to resolve the problem. While objectivity is sought - the common denominator of the aircraft noise issue is controversy - the author is representing the views of noise impacted airport community residents who cannot com- prehend the lack of progress in aircraft noise abatement. 161</page><page sequence="87">720623-720631 162 This lack of progress has persisted in spite of general agreement on measures needed and is the basis of a call for the reallocation of authority among federal agencies having responsibility both for the regulation of aviation and for the planning and development of urban areas, including airports, with environmental protection as basic criterion. 720623. (P-44) The Many- Wheeled Noise Monsters Must Be Tamed!. Theodore Berland, Citizens Against Noise, Chicago. Trucks are the major source of noise on our streets and highways, affecting the sleep and sanity of millions of city and suburban residents. Truck noise sources are many, but mainly are engine and tires. Since the automotive and trucking industries have not volunteered to quiet truck noises, the federal government will have to legally require they do so. 720624. (P-44) The Truck Noise Problem, and What Might Be Done About It. Rodger F. Ringham, International Harvester Co. From various sources of information it is clear that truck noise is a definite public nuisance. Early noise control efforts were very productive in that many heavy duty trucks did not have mufflers, and the addition of this device made clear improvements. Further improvement requires treatment of many sources significant to the overall level. It is felt that today's "tight but attainable" 88 dBA for heavy trucks can reduce to 86 dBA by 1975 and 84 dBA by 1978 with a lot of hard work. There is promise for meaningful noise regulation in the "real world" as indicated by "calibratability" of nonstandard sites. 720625. (P-44) Construction Noise, A Citizen's View- point. Robert Alex Baron, Citizens for a Quieter City, Inc. Construction noise accompanying the rehabilitation of old and the development of new transportation modes is extremely destructive to the quality of life, and the environment. With few exceptions, industry has failed to internalize the cost of unmuffled equipment and pro- cedures, and the cost of this intense noise exposure is an "external cost" borne by both the worker and the exposed public. Engine equipment manufacturers, contractors, and project sponsors resist design for quiet. Engineers have an ethical imperative to protect the noise receiver. Citizen demand for quieter construction is growing and a few manufacturers are voluntarily marketing quieter com- pressors and paving breakers. Government, on all levels, is beginning to raise the question of unlimited noise emissions. The Walsh Healey noise exposure limits are now applicable to construction operations. Industry should be given financial incentives and assistance to expedite the necessary change-over to design and oper- ation for quiet. 720626. (P-44) Noise Abatement - A Balanced Approach. Thomas C. Young, Engine Manufacturers As- sociation. Concern over noise emissions has increased significantly. This paper related the noise emission problem to other pollution efforts and defines alternative abatement strat- egies. Major technical and economic parameters are discussed based on the present state-of-the-art. A bal- anced approach to noise abatement is suggested. 720627. (P-44) Consideration of Environmental Noise Effects in Transportation Planning by Govern- mental Entities. Louis H. Mayo, The George Washington University. The increasing public concern in recent years over the problem of environmental noise has resulted in the enactment of technology-based regulatory agencies and statutory measures to control technological applications. Most of the earlier controls, however, were reactive measures rather than positive efforts to assure devel- opment of a new technology in the public interest. This situation is beginning to change as new environmental codes are being implemented in various states and cities. This paper describes how the noise factor has influenced the planning of transportation systems by various legislative and regulatory entities at the federal, regional, state, and local levels. 1972 SAE Transactions 720630. (P-44) Ecologie Ramifications of Air Pollution. Harvey Babich and Guenther Stotzky, New York University. Pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere by both industrial and natural processes. Natural processes also remove these pollutants from the atmosphere, but, when total emissions exceed the capacity of natural sinks, the quality of the air decreases. Air pollution can cause severe damage to plants, animals, and microorganisms. Air pollution can also cause subtle damage to the biosphere, as manifested by growth retardation, acceleration of aging processes, alterations in reproductive potential and genetic constitution, and alterations in host-parasite relations. However, air pollutants may serve some beneficial roles, such as satisfying some nutrient requirements of plants. Field studies, however, indicate that the environment, in general, is adversely affected by atmospheric pollution. Unfortunately, only speculations on ecologie ramifica- tions of air pollution are possible with the present level of knowledge. 1972 SAE Transactions 720631. (P-44) DDT - An Uncommon Carrier. Leland G. Merrill, Jr., Rutgers University. Environmental quality indices gain favor as means to express mathematically the status of the environment. One stress indicator points to pesticides as the top current cause of pollution stress. Using DDT as the example pesticide, the unanticipated phenomena encountered with</page><page sequence="88">720632-720643 DDT usage such as non-target kill, genetic resistance, biological magnification, and other side effects are described. Transportation is heavily involved not only with the use of pesticides but with the problems of air pollution and the use of heavy metals. Cautions are presented based on the DDT experience, particularly regarding the often too narrow base of a science to support broadly applied technology. 720632. (P-44) Transportation and Environmental De- sign: Opportunities and Conflicts in Cityscape and Regionscape. Ian Brown, Princeton Uni- versity. Socio-aesthetic forces are among the most influential determinants of urban form in present day society. These forces derive from a brief period of history still dominated by the Romantic, Picturesque, point of view. Regional and urban planners, victims of this aesthetic approach, currently provide fixed solutions and unmaneuverable transportation networks. An evolving society requires a network system that can respond to its development. The multivariate system of network reserves, justified in this paper, claims a capability of maximum response to change, with maximum adaptability to existing urban forms. It calls, however, for an espousal of monotonie socio-aesthetic principles opposed to those at present endemic in society. 720634. (P-44) A Balanced Approach - A Lawyer's Viewpoint. Jonathan T. Howe, Jenner &amp; Block. Laws controlling noise and the role of various local, state, and federal agencies must be balanced against their respective interests, limitations of technology and envi- ronmental goals. Past attempts to control noise sustain the need for a balanced approach. The interest of obtaining realistic, uniform standards which are enforced by realistic, uniform procedures will advance the cause of noise control. Inconsistent standards and enforcement procedures will only impede effective noise control. 720636. (P-44) Origins of Diesel Truck Noise and Its Control. P. E. Waters and T. Priede, University of Southampton (England). The paper discusses the fundamental origins of truck noise and shows the rate at which the noise of each individual source increases with speed. Various means of controlling noise from each component are considered. A method of predicting engine noise, and hence vehicle noise, from basic engine speed and piston diameter data is given and the significance of this information to the engine designer is emphasized. 1972 SA E Transactions 720639. (P-44) High Speed Train Noise Control. L. Duthion and C. Doyotte, Société BERTIN. This paper presents the tracked air cusion vehicle from a noise control point of view. The study of the different sources of noise points out that it is possible when using a linear induction motor to reduce the noise level to value as low as possible. In the case of very-high-speed vehicles other types of propulsion can be used. However, it remains possible to reach acceptable noise levels. 720640. (P-44) Are Present Horns, Whistles and Sirens Necessary for Communications? K. M. Eldred and B. H. Sharp, Wyle Labs. Horns, whistles and sirens are commonly used to convey information concerning time, location or warning. Of major concern to the community are the audible warning systems used on emergency vehicles and trains. The various types of existing audible warning systems and their historical development are discussed in this paper, together with an analysis of their effectiveness in fulfilling their prime function - namely, to warn people of imminent danger. It is concluded that such systems perform adequately in many situations, but not when the recipient of the warning signal is inside another vehicle. It is suggested that alternative means be developed for warning the occupants of vehicles of immediate danger so that audible warning systems of reduced acoustic power can be used to warn the pedestrian or other persons outside vehicles. 720641. (P-44) Environmental Aspects of New Traffic Technologies. H. Hedrich and P. J. Gaede, Krauss-Maffei AG (Germany). The aspects of comprehensive environmental protection must be taken into account in the very first concept phase of any technical development. For this reason the requirement for operation at low noise level, exhaust-free propulsion and a high measure of safety is among the primary demands within the performance catalog of the TRANSRAPID and TRANSURBAN transport technol- ogy. A comparison with conventional means of transport shows the advantages of the new systems. 720643. (P-44) Future Transportation and Air Quality - DOT Programs. John E. Hirten, U.S. Depart- ment of Transportation. Transportation plays a large role in our style of life, work, and many of our activities. At the same time, the present transportation technology has been a major contributor to the deterioration of environmental quality, particularly air quality. This paper discusses the efforts of the U.S. Department of Transportation to grapple with the prob- lems of transportation and air quality. Of principal concern to DOT is the requirement for states to prepare plans to meet 1975 air quality standards. DOT has been involved in reviewing these plans, addressing the trans- portation control aspects, and future efforts which may be undertaken to meet the standards. In addition, the Department has a specific environmental impact mandate in its various legislative authorities which includes air pollution and transportation related environmental qual- ity problems. 163</page><page sequence="89">720644-720650 164 720644. (P-44) The Role of Transportation Demand Models in the Projection of Future Urban and Regional Air Quality. E. J. Croke, K. G. Croke and J. E. Norco, Argonne National Laboratory. The significance of the impact of transportation system characteristics on the urban quality has resulted in a need to evaluate certain transportation air quality-oriented policy statements regarding the effect of present efforts to reduce emissions from automobile operation or to design transportation systems that do not constitute a danger to air quality. The evaluation of these policies requires the integration of planning techniques from both transpor- tation and environmental fields. The classical transportation system planning process involves a well-established sequence of data acquisition and systems analysis activities. Likewise, the regional air pollution planning procedures also depend on the use of a sequence of empirical models that require a substantial data base. An interface of the transportation system and air pollution control planning processes is clearly re- quired; the output of one or more of the members of the sequence of transportation models must be translated into an emission inventory that is required to drive the sequence of air pollution models. This paper describes such an integration developed as part of the Argonne Transportation- Air Pollution Model. Two policy applications using this model are described to illustrate the sequence of steps required to use trans- portation data in an air quality model and to indicate how a transportation air quality model can be used as a policy evaluation tool. These two policy evaluations are the reduction of automotive emission of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides in the Chicago metropolitan area that would be achieved by the current federal automotive emission standards; and the reduction of these pollutants that would be achieved by applying both the federal standards and a proposed City of Chicago ordinance which initiates an automotive inspec- tion-maintenance system. 720645. (P-44) Air Quality Implications of Future Trans- portation Systems. Richard K. Brail, Rutgers University. The contribution of future transportation system config- urations to air pollution is examined. The necessary linkages between transportation and land use systems are recognized, and projections of population growth and distribution made. It is found that although future air quality resulting from transportation will be markedly improved over current pollution levels, the increased vehicle-miles traveled yearly in the United States will require substantial investment in transportation networks and shifts in demand for various transportation modes. 720646. (P-44) Personal Rapid Transit Systems and Their Relationship to the Environment. Luis R. Lazo and John B. Bohle, Transportation Technology, Inc. The paper presents both qualitive and quantitative data on the relationshio of emerging Personal Rapid Transit systems and the environment. Specific reference is made to comparison of these systems with the U.S. air pollutant inventory and with the automobile. Thermal pollution and reduction of power supply requirements for these transit systems are considered. Definitive specification infor- mation for interior/exterior noise levels, in comparison with other transportation modes and with background conditions, are provided. Visual aesthetics of guideway, station, and vehicle design are presented as the most challenging remaining problem in the integration of Personal Rapid Transit systems into the society. 720647. (P-44) A New Pollution Free Tracked Air Cushion, Air Driven Rapid Transit Vehicle. Yau Wu, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. A new concept of the linear air turbine vehicle is proposed. The tracked air cushion and air driven rapid transit system is designed for the future high speed ground transportation in the urban area. Through the compressed air pipe lines to the passive vehicle, the system employs the principle of compressor, pipe, heating chamber, nozzel, turbine, air cushion and jet in a new combination. This vehicle contributes no air, thermal, vibration nor noise pollution. Many technical, environmental and economical problems have been discussed. The primary results indicate that this is indeed a very efficient, practical and economical system for the future high speed ground transportation in the major cities. 720648. (P-44) Motor Vehicle Restraints for Clean Air - Some Implications for Air Pollution Control Policy. Robert Witherspoon, Institute of Public Administration. Deciding what to do about the motor vehicle is charac- terized by conditions of complexity, value conflicts and uncertainty about the future. Doing something faces the difficulty of affecting a fragmented policy making process. Under such circumstances the most appropriate way to proceed is by seeking additional knowledge through research and experimentation. Research should start from the premise that motor vehicle restraints for clean air would probably entail measures much greater in scale and severity than currently contemplated. Measures of this magnitude imply practical and political problems of an entirely different order, and very probably, profound changes in city form and function as we know them today. 720650. (P-44) Environmental Considerations in Urban Transportation Planning. Jack Kinstlinger, Penn- sylvania Department of Transportation. The systems approach to transportation planning has proven itself to be sound and effective. To accommodate itself to today's values, however, the planning process must be broadened so that it considers community impacts as fully as economic impacts. While current</page><page sequence="90">720652-720661 legislation and regulations mandate such an approach, additional research and data gathering are required to allow the full evaluation of community impacts. Trans- portation planning must conceive of strategies other than constructing new facilities. These include economic and land development policies and low capital intensive alternatives. More citizen participation and better inter- governmental decision-making on a metropolitan-wide basis are required if urban transportation plans are to gain public support and if their timely implementation is to be realized. 720652. (P-44) The Iconography of Urban Systems. Ernest Schwiebert, Ecosystemics. This paper argues that without a clear technically-based philosophy for structuring our cities, an iconography of systems equal to their growth and movement and change, our planning efforts are doomed to failure. Neither the architect, in his preoccupation with individual projects and mere pieces of cityscape, nor the engineer, in his willingness to slice into the living tissue of the city without understanding its socio-environmental pathology, is trained to cope with our problems of urban design. Yet it is the vast technical networks of movement that are the lifeblood of our cities, and have the most promise of providing an infrastructure capable of ordering growth and change in our cities. However, urban sociologists are preoccupied with problems of social diagnosis, architects reject technology as a conceptual skeleton for their esthetic games, and engineers seem unable to grasp the vast esthetic implications of transportation technology in the cityscape of tomorrow. 720655. (P-44) California Laws and Regulations Relating to Motor Vehicle Noise. A. S. Cooper, California Highway Patrol. Reasonable and effective laws for the enforcement of motor vehicle noise have been enacted and successfully applied in California. Specific laws to prohibit both sale and operation of noisy vehicles were necessary. Meas- urements by both instruments and human ear judgments are practical and necessary at this time. Noise limits whould be gradually reduced commensurate with the needs of the public and the capability of the technology. Future controls on noise producing components, in addition to the complete vehicle, appear to be necessary to obtain desirable minimum levels. California has pioneered interim solutions to portions of this environmental problem and has developed the expertise along with the practical experience to achieve further advancements in solving the problems. 720657. (P-44) And Now a Word from the Regulatee!. Ralph K. Hillquist, General Motors Corp. Regulation of noise from motor vehicles is an inevitability. To provide optimum benefit to the community at a minimum of additional cost to its citizens, these regu- lations must recognize the responsibilities of all parties involved, provide uniform requirements as appropriate to the level of government, and embody a flexibility to adapt to new findings and circumstances. Both manufacturer and operator, as regulatees, must be considered in the drafting of vehicle noise restrictions. 720658. (P-44) Regulatory Approaches to Controlling Rail Rapid Transit Noise. Kenneth G. Knight, De Leuw, Cather and Co. America's need for mass transportation systems to meet the challenge of maintaining urban mobility in the 1970s coincides with a growing public awareness and concern for environmental problems including noise pollution. In rail rapid transit, significant technological advances have already been made and used in modern systems on a voluntary basis to alleviate the effects of operational noise and vibration on both passenger and community. Since quite costs money, experience has generally proven that enforced legislation is necessary to obtain quieter products from industry. However, the rail rapid transit systems of this country are essential public services which will play an increasingly vital role in urban transportation. Therefore the establishment of practical noise control guidelines for new systems through the cooperative effort of both government and industry and the initiation of a comprehensive early action program of research, demonstration and subsequent improvement of existing systems are put forward as viable alternatives to the establishment of mandatory noise controls for the entire rail rapid transit industry. 720659. (P-44) Toward a Balanced Strategy for Air Quality Control. C. Kenneth Orski, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The lingering uncertainties about the ability of the source control strategy alone to achieve and maintain the national ambient air quality standards in certain met- ropolitan areas argue strongly in favor of widening our options. A mixed abatement strategy, combining the progressive improvement of the technology of exhaust emission control with deliberate efforts to reduce the use of cars in the cities is proposed. The effectiveness and feasibility of various forms of vehicle restraints are examined. 720661. (P-44) Social and Economic Implications of Low Emission Vehicles. Robert U. Ayres, Interna- tional Research and Technology Corp. The basis for formulating so-called "uniform" emission standards for motor vehicles is examined and found to be inconsistent with the widely accepted principle that "the polluter should pay," if consideration is given to the problems caused by pollution rather than the sources of emissions. Atmospheric pollution problems are geograph- ically limited and also depend upon other variables such as time of day, and weather conditions. The major problems are associated with Southern California and other cities of the southwest, and congested urban areas. It 165</page><page sequence="91">720662-720670 166 is proposed that emissions standards should be made flexible in order to reflect these environmental variations, and thus to achieve the maximum environmental im- provement for the least total cost to vehicle owners and users. Several "zoning" schemes are discussed, having the common feature that cars meeting the most rigorous standards would be required only in zones having the greatest density of vehicles and pollution (or the greatest propensity of "smog"). Such zones would probably be small enough in geographic extent to affect only a small fraction of vehicles - mainly taxis, delivery trucks and CBD commuters - at most 15% or so of the vehicles registered. Given the smaller number of vehicles involved, a fairly short (say 3 years) transition would probably be adequate. 720662. (P-44) Air Transportation System Planning: Progress in Noise Reduction. A. L. McPike, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Many different groups are involved in air transportation system planning and noise fits into this planning in a very complex manner. This paper presents a brief examination of how community noise considerations affect the devel- opment of new commercial transport aircraft. The general noise level goals of the manufacturer are discussed and information is provided to show that, contrary to popular opinion, the noise levels of succeeding generations of jet transports have generally been lower than those of their predecessors. Some of the evaluation procedures available for minimizing community noise are examined, along with some of the constraints the aircraft manufacturer faces in the design process. A brief assessment of what the future trends in community noise levels will be is presented here. 720664. (P-44) Rail Mass Transportation System Plan- ning and Noise. George Paul Wilson, Wilson, Ihrig &amp; Associates, Inc. The noise produced by new high-speed rail rapid transit system operations is much less than traditionally expected due to modern design concepts and equipment which include specific features for reducing noise and vibration. Using data obtained from various operational and experimental rail transit vehicles and systems, the noise characteristics to be expected from new and proposed systems and equipment have been determined. The known and specified noise characteristics can be used during the planning of transit systems to determine the expected wayside or community noise levels for various types of way structures, vehicles, and operational conditions, and can also be used to determine design features or system characteristics which should be included for the control of noise. This permits the inclusion of noise as one of the factors affecting system planning and design. 720665. (P-44) Comprehensive Community-Transporta- tion System Planning and Noise. R. Dale Beland, Wilsey &amp; Ham. To date new transportation systems have failed to avoid the impact of noise on the surrounding community, due to lack of adequate planning in terms of depth of research and analysis, lack of attention to the whole problem of noise pollution, and the lack of coordinated planning of communities and the transport system that serve them. This paper discusses several ways to achieve greater coordination between community planning and trans- portation planning in order to reduce noise. A systems approach should include the steps of identification of objectives, identification of programs, prediction of effectiveness, and evaluation of alternatives. Several means of doing this are discussed. 720667. (P-44) Natural Systems Integrated with Trans- portation Planning. Donald L. Williams, Uni- versity of Louisville. Natural science information can be used to more sensi- tively locate major urbanization components such as new communities and major components of the national transportation system, such as airports. The public decision-maker needs this information displayed in a systematic, usable form so that the consequences of all alternative choices are apparent prior to the final decision. The integration of the natural sciences, evolving opera- tions research techniques and community development tools appear to offer a procedure for producing this vital planning ingredient. 720669. Selection Models - Small Truck Fleets. J. C. Selby, Weldwood of Canada Ltd. The purpose of this report is to develop analytical models that may be used to determine the size and number of trucks required to provide a given service level at the lowest possible cost. Two models are presented, they are: 1. The Simulation-Linear Program Truck Selection Model: This model employs simulation to determine the number of miles driven and linear programming to minimize the "total cost objective function." 2. The Truck Salesman's Truck Selection Model: This model is less accurate than the "Simulation-L.P." model but is also less laborious and easier to use. It applies "trial and error" solutions to the L.P. objective function and uses other equations developed for the Simulation-L.P. model to make these solutions as accurate as possible. The two models have been used on a number of case studies and similar results have been obtained. Thus, it is hypothesized that because the results are similar the models must be correct. The report concludes with a discussion of some of the nonquantifiable problems that may be encountered when rationalizing a truck fleet. 1972 SA E Transactions 720670. The Boston Reformed Fuel Car. Marc S. Newkirk and James L. Abel, International Materials Corp. International Materials undertook to develop an inher- ently low-polluting automobile, the "Boston Car," with</page><page sequence="92">720671-720678 two fixed design parameters: the use of an internal combustion engine and the use of gasoline fuel. On-board production of carbon dioxide-hydrogen mixtures to fuel the engine was the approach undertaken; gasoline was reacted with steam to produce a "reformed" fuel upstream from the engine. Initial efforts to develop an engine to burn the mixture revealed problems with respect to starting reliability and high rpm carburetor flashback. Starting reliability was achieved by providing accurate air/fuel ratios at cranking speeds. It was necessary to employ a spark distributor lacking any provisions for spark advance in order to guarantee elimination of flashback at advanced rpms. These modifications have resulted in extremely fine road performance from the test vehicle, comparable to the production model prior to modification. The reformed fuel production unit involved miniatur- ization of certain refinery techniques for the production of synthetic gas mixtures. In engineering this miniatur- ization, certain central factors were encountered. Devel- opment of reliable metering and pumping systems, heat exchange mechanisms, burner assembly, and reformer canister involved relatively straightforward engineering programs. Carbon deposition in the reformer coil, how- ever, proved to be a peculiarly difficult problem but proprietary designs have allowed solution of this problem, insuring increased thermal efficiency and unit life. The Boston Car concept retains all of the advantages of standard automotive technology. Low profile fuel system changes are involved, and production feasible innovations. High system efficiencies and engine per- formance provide the comfort of use required for consumer acceptability. Extremely low emissions signa- ture provides an adequate resolution for the problem of air pollution from mobile sources. 1972 SAE Transactions 720671. The Effective Fit Concept as Used in ANSI B92. 1-1970, Involute Splines and Inspection (inch and metric). Leon DeVos, Ford Motor Co. The effective fit concept for involute splines, as docu- mented in the American National Standard B92. 1-1970, is described. The flexibility of the concept is demonstrated, and examples in both English and metric (SI) units of measure are given. The paper reflects the latest (1970) revision to the B92. 1 standard, which was developed in the '40s and first published under the designation B5.15. 720672. Control of Particulate Lead Emissions From Automobiles. E. N. Cantwell, E. S. Jacobs, W. G. Kunz, Jr. and V. E. Liberi, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). Exhaust particulate lead trapping systems and devices designed to reduce airborne lead emissions by 65% or more have been developed and tested on vehicles. Tests of up to 60,000 miles indicate that these devices should retain their effectiveness and last the lifetime of a passenger vehicle without maintenance. The traps reduced the total amount of lead emitted from production vehicles operated on lead gasoline by 82-91%. They also reduced by 64-84% the amount of lead in the air after driving both production and trap-equipped vehicles through a vehicular tunnel. When a trapping system was combined with a gaseous emission control system, consisting of exhaust manifold thermal reactor and exhaust gas recirculation systems, the total lead emitted was reduced by 85% and the amount of lead found in the air of the vehicular tunnel was reduced by 70% when compared with production vehicles. 720676. The Future of the Aerospace Industry in Texas. H. A. Helstrom, Vought Aeronautics Co. This paper presents a graphic picture of the problems facing the aeronautics industry in the state of Texas. Following the national pattern of aerospace distribution of employment, the slowdown of contracts in this industry to firms employing approximately 80,000 people, has created a not too pleasant picture. While the situation appears to be stabilizing, diver- sification to other allied fields, such as ground trans- portation, with its air cushion vehicle systems, LIM- powered systems, etc., is called for. A plea has been made for engineers to apply their talents to other than aerospace production, and to develop new products and markets. 720677. Guidance of Vehicles by Telecommand in Order to Simulate Accidents. Harald J. Schimkat, Erich W. Unterreiner and Rudiger W. Will, Volks wagen werk AG. After using an analog computer and a mechanical substitution system to determine if the project was possible, a remote control ground vehicle was designed and constructed which would follow a predetermined course at a given speed to test the handling characteristics of vehicles and to conduct crash tests safely. The vehicle is guided visually via onboard TV. Data are fed back by 6-channel FM, while 4-channel FM serves to transmit commands to servo motors in the unmanned vehicle. Except for a cathode ray tube, all onboard control instrumentation is crashproof, and a self-contained power source provides for fail-safe braking. 1972 SAE Transactions 720678. Control Characteristics of the Driver at Braking. Kazuhiko Aoki, Akebono Brake Industry Co., Ltd. In order to determine the operational characteristics of human pedal force, a driving simulator consisting of a driver's seat, pedals, analog computer, double gun synchroscope, etc., was developed. The driver was asked to guide the spot representing the controlled variable using the spot as a target. A simple transfer function to match the test results was derived and the effect of parameters on the constants in this function was analyzed. This experiment established that a pedal force of 200 daN seemed best for control. 167</page><page sequence="93">720679-720685 168 720679. Fuel Injection - Another Tool for Emission Control. G. D. LaMasters, Marvel-Schebler/ Tillotson Div., Borg-Warner Corp. Interest in fuel injection is spurred on by the promise of lower emissions. The problem of NOx will require better control of fuel metering to comply with the emission standards set by the federal government. Fuel injection and other basic engine changes can provide the emission levels by operating in a lean air/fuel ratio to reduce NOx. 720680. Seat Belt Type Passive Restraint System. Juichiro Takada, Takata Kojyo Co. Ltd. (Ja- pan). Takata Kojyo Co. Ltd. has developed a compact passive occupant restraint system using seat belts for automobiles. The objectives of the system included: increased fre- quency of seat belt use, greater safety factor in high-speed crashes, minimized inconvenience and discomfort often associated with the use of seat belts, availability of the system for all types of cars, minimized alterations or changes needed to install the system in a car, and development of a system which is compact, economical to install, and convenient to use. The operation of the automatic seat belt restraint system is as follows: When the contoured, vehicle bucket seat is occupied, and the ignition is energized, two wrap-around movable arms extend from the base of the car seat on either side of the occupant to automatically place and fasten the three-point safety belt around the occupant. The two mechanical arms which apply the belt then retract to their neutral positions under the seat. The movable arms are used only to apply and buckle the belt. The paper describes the installation and operation of the system in detail. 720681. Application of Kinetic Energy Propulsion to Mass Transportation. Louis J. Lawson, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., Inc. The need for new mass transit vehicle alternatives has been spurred by the growing concern in our cities over photochemical smog, noise, smoke, odor, and transit system operating deficits, which are to a large degree the products of present rolling equipment. A project planned in conjunction with the San Francisco Municipal Railway is intended to demonstrate a practical kinetic energy (flywheel) propulsion system providing optimized electric transit with route flexibility and increased quality of service. The dual-mode trolley coaches used for the demonstration will be capable of providing scaled oper- ational data that can be extrapolated to new classes of ecologically and socially acceptable vehicles. 720682. The Demonstration of an External Combustion Engine in a City Bus. Richard D. Burtz and Rodney L. Burton, Steam Power Systems, Inc. An External Combustion Engine (ECE) was designed, tested, and retrofitted to a 40 ft, 46-passenger city bus. The bus was tested and demonstrated comparable accel- eration and lower external noise, odor, and air pollution emissions than a diesel bus. Presently, ECE bus fuel consumption is considerably higher than that of a diesel bus. It is shown in this paper how ECE fuel consumption can be improved with further development, although not to lower levels than the diesel. More time in service is needed to determine the ECE bus operating costs, which depend largely on the costs of powerplant maintenance. 720684. Characteristics of the Brobeck Steam Bus Engine. Francis C. Younger, William M. Brobeck &amp; Associates. This paper describes the characteristics of a low-pollution steam engine for the California Steam Bus Demonstration Project. The nature of combustion in an external com- bustion engine is such that the lower levels of exhaust emissions should be expected. To demonstrate the lower exhaust emission level and to show that steam engines are feasible powerplants for automotive applications, a recip- rocating-type steam powerplant was designed, built, tested, and installed in an urban bus. The system was designed to provide performance and handling characteristics similar to those initially found in the diesel-powered bus without significantly altering the appearance of the bus or reducing its seating capacity. To accomplish this limited objective for demonstration purposes, all available space, including that under the bus, was utilized for major components. A 3-cyl double-acting compound engine is used to extract work from steam delivered at 800 psia and 850 F. The exhaust steam is condensed in a vented system, where the exhaust is maintained at nearly atmospheric pressure. Condensate is recirculated to a monotube type vapor generator. The feedwater and burner control are similar to those used in the later Doble steam cars. Data on performance of the bus with this engine are presented. 720685. Low Pollution Characteristics of Urban Transit Buses Fueled with Liquefied Natural Gas. P. C. Malte and G. A. Wooldridge, Rohr Industries, Inc. The advantages of liquefied natural gas as a fuel for urban transit buses are discussed. Urban transit buses powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) are both feasible and practical as transportation systems for many metropolitan areas desiring cleaner air. The Rohr-Flexible LNG bus utilizes a four-cycle diesel engine that has been converted to spark ignition, natural gas operation. Analysis of gaseous exhaust emissions for the natural gas bus engine, plus its performance and noise characteristics, and installation details, are presented. Smoke and odor emissions are sensed as being negligible. This and other reported investigations on natural gas engine emissions, including the fact that the emitted hydrocarbons exhibit a low photochemical reactivity in polluted atmospheres, give heavy-duty LNG powered systems a clear advantage over diesel counterparts.</page><page sequence="94">720686-720690 720686. Interactions Among Oil Additive and Engine Operating Parameters Affecting Engine Deposits and Wear. Loren G. Pless, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Engine deposits and wear are greatly affected by engine oil-additive treatment variables and by engine-operating parameters, such as oil-change interval and oil filtration. While each of these two major elements has been investigated extensively, little is known about interactions between these elements. Tests with 1963-1967 model United States passenger cars, operating with leaded commercial gasolines in several types of service, evaluated effects on deposits and wear of: 1. Ashless (nonmetallic) dispersants. 2. Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDP), type and concentration. 3. Interactions between dispersant and ZDP. 4. Interaction among dispersant concentration, oil- change interval, and supplementary bypass oil filtration. Sludge and varnish deposit control differed widely among three dispersants used at equal concentrations. Increasing the concentration of the best dispersant reduced sludge but not varnish. Increasing ZDP concentration above about 0.06 weight % zinc greatly reduced valve train scuffing. At one zinc concentration (0.12 weight %), valve lifters wore similarly using ZDP made with either primary or sec- ondary alcohols. Increasing ZDP concentration decreased cam and lifter wear with high-dispersant concentrations, but increased wear at low-dispersant concentrations. Less wear occurred with low ZDP concentrations in low- dispersancy oils than at any ZDP concentration in high-dispersancy oils. Deposits and wear increased with increasing oil- change interval, and at each interval, more deposits and generally more wear occurred using a low-dispersancy oil than a high-dispersancy oil. With high-dispersancy oils, supplementary filtration had no effect on deposits and wear. With low-dispersancy oils, supplementary filtration reduced sludging and cam and lifter wear, but did not effect varnish or piston ring and bearing wear. Discussion: T. V.

A method is presented for determining the extent of volatility loss in crankcase oils. Under high temperature test conditions, the oil consumption of oils of varying volatility levels correlated very well with their volatility loss. A method is presented for predicting the oil consumption due to volatility of a crankcase oil. 720688. A Laboratory Engine Test Method and Its Application to Evaluation of High Temperature Oil Thickening Problems in Gasoline Engines. J. V. D. Wilson, G. J. J. Jayne and E. G. Thomas, Edwin Cooper &amp; Co. Ltd. A method of evaluating oil thickening under high temperature conditions has been developed in a single cylinder gasoline engine. It is a preliminary laboratory engine test method which has been used for the evaluation of experimental antioxidants, and the paper includes results and discussion of work in this field. Development of the method to achieve required severity, precision, and correlation with other methods such as the ASTM Sequence UIC is also described. 720689. Unleaded Gasoline - Lubricant Requirements and Fuel Additive Performance. D. S. Orrin, W. R. Miner and K. L. Kipp, Chevron Research Co. Unleaded gasoline was used in a 30 car, 48,000 mile taxicab field test to study the effects of a deposit control (DC) gasoline additive and lubricating oil additives on engine deposits, wear, and other variables. With both gasolines containing DC additive, unleaded gasoline performed as well as or better than leaded gasoline in this test. Engine deposits were comparable, and wear and corrosion were reduced when unleaded gasoline was used. With unleaded gasoline, we found motor oils need a high level of ashless dispersant to obtain maximum varnish control. Also, in these test engines, an ashless oil gave the same wear protection with unleaded gasoline that an SE type of oil gave with leaded gasoline. A highly effective DC gasoline additive minimized carburetor, intake valve, and crankcase deposits with unleaded gasoline. This agreed with the effective per- formance that this additive had previously shown in leaded gasoline service. Also, unleaded fuel with the DC additive used with a nondispersant crankcase oil per- formed similarly to a nonadditive fuel used with an SE type of oil in the control of engine sludge and varnish.

The current demands of the earthmoving industry are placing increased pressure and responsibility on the equipment manufacturer. Coupled with government reg- ulations, this presents a new set of standards to which the manufacturer must conform. This presents a formidable challenge to everyone involved in this field of endeavor. This paper discusses the effects of these factors on the design and development of a large earthmoving machine, the 675 front-end loader. The 675 is a large loader, built for heavy-duty work, that has high standards of main- tenance, performance, and safety. This paper points out the features built into this machine to meet the growing demands for these qualities. 169</page><page sequence="95">720691-720699 170 720691.

Engine Performance and Exhaust Emissions: Methanol versus Isooctane. G. D. Ebersole, Phillips Petroleum Co.; and F. S. Manning, The University of Tulsa. Operating characteristics of a single-cylinder, spark- ignition engine fueled by both methanol and isooctane were determined. Engine output, indicated specific fuel consumption, and specific emissions of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and aldehydes were measured for both fuels and compared using performance maps. The engine output comparisons showed that lean misfire limits occurred at leaner mixtures with methanol than with isooctane and that maximum engine output levels were nearly equal for both fuels. Comparison of the specific parameters of each fuel at equivalent power levels obtained with maximum power spark timing permits the following conclusions: Use of methanol results in higher indicated specific fuel con- sumption, greater emission of aldehydes, but lower emissions of hydrocarbon and nitric oxide; the two fuels showed similar trends of carbon monoxide emission.

Andrews and R. S. Devoto, Stanford University. An American Motors Gremlin has been converted to low-pollution operation on methanol through the use of an exhaust-heated intake manifold, a rejetted carburetor with heat exchanger for heating of fuel-air charge, a catalytic muffler, and an exhaust-port air injector. Tests carried out at EPA laboratories demonstrated that this car surpasses the 1975-1976 federal standards for unburned HC, CO, and NOx. The low levels of HC and CO are due to lean operation and the use of an oxidizing catalyst. The low NOx emissions are due partially to retarded spark- timing and lean operation, and, as indicated in a chemical kinetic model of NO formation, to properties of methanol that are favorable to low NO levels. Results of gas Chromatograph and chemical analyses of the exhaust for organics, aldehydes, and ammonia are also discussed. Discussion: Ted Selby, SAVANT, Inc.; and John C.

Nigro, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Initial installation of regenerative industrial gas turbine engines into traditional diesel power applications pre- sented numerous challenges.

Regulation of Commercial Motor Vehicle Interior Noise Levels. D. W. Morrison and R. M. Clarke, Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety, Federal High- way Administration. This paper reports and analyzes two sets of test data that were taken to determine the interior noise levels of typical heavy-duty trucks. Under controlled test conditions, various stationary tests were run in an effort to correlate their results with those obtained during SAE J366 and J336 dynamic tests conducted at the same time. In addition, sound level exposures were determined for various over-the-road operations in an attempt to corre- late these results with the static test results. 720698. How Loud are Diesel Truck Cabs? Thomas D. Hutton, Freightliner Corp. This study investigates the intensity and the duration of noise exposure to which a driver is subjected during actual freight hauling, over-the-road operation of cab-over- engine, intercity, diesel trucks on typical western interstate freeways. To do this, a practical instrument package was developed for recording dBA noise levels over extended periods of time. The noise levels produced during extended operation are compared with results of single decibel readings taken under various circumstances with the tractor stationary and accelerating. A determination is made as to whether the driver's occupational noise exposure is within the limits specified by Walsh-Healey for the various tractors tested. 720699. Correlation of Standard Truck Cab Interior Noise Tests to Operational Noise. Joseph H. Emme, H. L. Blachford, Inc. Noise levels of trucks, both interior and exterior, have been studied extensively in the last few years. However, most of these noise studies have been performed under carefully controlled conditions. This paper presents the results of two studies which were concerned with the noise level experienced by the truck driver during actual operation. The first study's purpose was to determine the noise level of actual operation while the second study compared actual operational noise to the noise level that was produced during three standard test methods.

Mathematical Expressions Relating Evaporative Emissions From Motor Vehicles Without Evap- orative Loss-Control Devices to Gasoline Vola- tility. William F. Biller, Michael Manoff, Jyotin Sachdev and William C. Zegel, Scott Research Labs., Inc.; and David T. Wade, Esso Research and Engineering Co. A program was undertaken to study the effects of fuel volatility characteristics on evaporative emissions from motor vehicles without evaporative loss-control devices. The ultimate objective of this study was to derive a simple mathematical expression relating evaporative emissions from an urban car population to gasoline volatility parameters. Since development of the necessary data base for such a program through direct experimentation would have been quite inefficient, an alternate approach was taken in deriving a set of mathematical models to calculate evaporative emissions from carburetors and fuel tanks of motor vehicles. These models were verified by comparison with limited experimental data. Information available on daily urban area vehicle use and data on how fuel system temperatures vary with vehicle, vehicle use, and ambient temperature were then used to develop a general model that would calculate daily evaporative emissions from a vehicle population, given the ambient temperature conditions and fuel volatility pa- rameters. Linear regression analyses on these calculated data resulted in a simple mathematical expression for predicting the daily average evaporative emissions from motor vehicles. Such an expression is of interest in studying the effects of changes in gasoline volatility characteristics on evaporative emissions from uncon- trolled motor vehicles. 720701. Sound Attenuation in Operator Enclosures. Ray Sellon, Stolper Industries, Inc. This paper outlines parameters for the design of operator's enclosures (cabs), with the special reference to noise control. Specific suggestions for the solution of noise pollution include shock mounting of the cab, plugging all holes through which noise can enter; attenuating large sheet metal areas by damping, effectively using large amounts of glass, diverting the exhaust outlet away from the cab, providing a fan shroud, not mounting sound generating components to enclosure walls. Such steps should reduce the sound level by 15-20 dB, but will add 12-15% to the overall cost of the enclosure. 720702. Design Considerations for Noise Insulation of Operator Cabs. Joseph H. Emme, H. L. Blachford, Inc. The noise insulation of operator cabs for construction and agricultural equipment has become increasingly important in the last few years. This paper presents a discussion on the noise control design considerations for the basic structure, control levers, and effective sealing. Also discussed are the parameters to consider in the use of absorption and transmission loss materials. 720706. Tractor Noise Analysis - Open and Enclosed Operators. Bernard H. Ris, Ford Motor Co. Proper analysis technique is the most vital step toward controlling the noise to which the tractor operator is exposed. Two distinct situations arise when: unenclosed, or cab enclosed operators are considered. This paper presents the noise analysis technique required in each case. For tractors without operator enclosures, the noise sources must be located and ranked according to their conbtibution. A complete analysis of the engine-produced noise level is presented. Enclosing the operator represents a means of con- trolling the sound level to which he is exposed. Analysis and priority ranking of several methods used to reduce the noise level inside the enclosure is developed. 720707. On The Noise Reduction of a Rectangular Box With Application to Tractor Cabs. M. G. Milsted and E. L. Wegscheid, Deere &amp; Co. The mechanisms by which airborne sound energy is transmitted into a vehicle cab are discussed. Airborne noise reduction of cabs is seen to deviate considerably from the mass-law behavior of the constituent materials. Various acoustical treatments are evaluated experimen- tally by directly measuring the noise reduction on a cab-like enclosure. The experimental results agree fairly well with available theoretical methods of computing noise reduction.

Equations have been derived for designing automatic tensioning variable speed V-belt drives. Such drives employ a screw principle to increase tension in the belt as loading of the drive increases. Adjustable tensioning makes it possible for variable speed drives to transmit significantly larger loads without overly penalizing belt life. This feature is possible because high tensions required by heavy loads are not retained during lighter loads experienced under normal operation. Drives have been designed by these equations and have been proven successful both in the field and laboratory. Experience in designing the drives is discussed and general recommendations are provided for the design of new torque sensing drives. Other types of applications are described that would also benefit from torque- actuated tensioning. 1972 SAE Transactions 171</page><page sequence="97">720709-720718 172 720709. Design and Development of a High Horsepower Torque Sensing Variable Speed Drive. Duane L. Keller and Ronald E. Wilson, Allis-Chalmers Corp. The application of torque-sensitive drives for combine belt drives affords the advantage of allowing the drive to be normally tensioned at lower tensions but still maintain the aggressiveness to transmit high peak horsepower loads. Dayco's equations will predict drive design (driven and driver axial forces, tight and slack side tensions) for various output loads. Varying the cam actuators surface and ramp angle will increase or decrease the effect of torque sensing. Belt-sheave and actuator surface coef- ficients of friction were experimentally determined. 720710. Driveline Torque Coupling for Tractor Draft Control. C. E. McKeon, Ford Tractor Opera- tions.

A small, two-stage, transonic axial compressor was selected for a 5 lb/s airflow, 0.46 lb/hp • h, sfc turboshaft engine at 2500 F turbine-inlet gas temperature. The axial compressor was configured to supercharge a single stage centrifugal compressor to provide an overall axial/cen- trifugal pressure ratio of 16:1. The axial compressor was designed, fabricated, and developed through rig testing. On final test, a pressure ratio of 3.1:1 was demonstrated at 80% efficiency with 10% surge margin. 720713. Design and Test of a Small High-Pressure Ratio, Axial Compressor with Tandem and Swept Stators. Charles J. Paine, AiResearch Manu- facturing Co. A small (22.2 lb/s), high-pressure ratio (1.83), axial compressor stage with a tandem stator has been designed and tested. The rotor was based on a 0.359-scale of a design made for NASA. The tandem stator consisted of a backward-swept first stage and a rectilinear (zero sweep) second stage. The scaled-stage overall performance was comparable to that of the full-size stage. 720714. Economic Factors in Radiator Selection. Neal A. Cook, Modine Manufacturing Co. With the impact of noise regulations and the need for controlling costs, the choice of a cooling system needs more careful study. This paper presents an analysis of the optimum radiator size for a given cooling load considering three types of cores. The sum of the first cost and operating cost is analyzed on the basis of return on investment using the method of discounted cash flow. An analysis of a standard line of radiators showing the relationship of total owning and operating cost versus engine cooling load is also presented. Total useful operating life is shown as well as operating hours per year. Curves of noise levels are also shown for this analysis to help provide a decision-making tool in the choice of radiators. 720715. Kool Pak - A High-Capacity, Quiet, Thermo- statically Modulated Cooling System for Mobile Vehicles. James R. Pharis, McQuay Perfex Inc. Anticipating increasingly firm noise legislation and higher engine horsepowers, a complete cooling system has been developed for mobile vehicles that shows considerable promise as a method of efficiently and quietly cooling engines of high horsepower. This system, consisting of a fan, fan drive, and radiator, features thermostatic modu- lation of the fan, a low velocity, quiet air-moving method, low fan horsepower, and a conventional radiator with a high-capacity core. The remote aspect gives the vehicle manufacturer freedom to use a radiator of unconventional size and shape, and flexibility to encapsulate various noise-producing components of the vehicle. 720717. Coordinating the Complete Cooling Package. Earl Bell, Young Radiator Co. There is more to the cooling system than just the jacket water radiator. Consideration must be given to the heat generated by the torque converter, hydraulic system, turbocharger, lube oil cooler, and the air conditioning. Total heat load, water pump flow, fan performance, deaeration, and drawdown requirements dictate further considerations. Reasonable preliminary evaluation of these significant aspects of a cooling system can save manufacturing costs as well as operating costs, while effectively prolonging the life of the machine. A simple check list can save both time and money. 720718. Hearing Protection for Farm Equipment Oper- ators - The Challenge of the 70s. Robert Pish and Cecil R. Sparks, Southwest Research Institute.</page><page sequence="98">720719-720728 Recent legislative pressures directed toward protection of hearing acuity have placed an increased urgency on the agricultural industry's noise-reduction program. Hampered, however, by a serious lack of definitive data in dealing with hearing loss, the industry must put added pressure and priority on obtaining such data. This paper outlines the required measurement standards and data needed to accomplish this action. 720719. Sound Level Tests of Agricultural Tractors. W. E. Splinter, University of Nebraska; and M. L. Mumgaard, G. W. Steinbruegge and L. F. Larsen, Nebraska Tractor Test Lab. Sound level at the operator station and at a bystander position 7.5m from the center line of the vehicle has been measured at the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory on 67 agricultural tractors. Sound values at 100, 75, and 50% drawbar load are reported. Results indicate that farm tractor manufacturers have made significant progress in reducing sound levels to acceptable values. 1972 SA E Transactions 720720. An Update on Noise Control at International Harvester. Richard T. Bennett, International Harvester Co. International Harvester has testified to the Environmental Protection Agency about present noise levels and has stated what it considers to be reasonable goals. Noise control work is progressing, especially in the area of environmental noise on lawn and garden equipment and operator noise on larger tractors. The engineering com- munity must take every opportunity to present the case for cost-benefit considerations in noise control. 720724. Characteristics of Multiple Range Hydro- mechanical Transmissions. Eli Orshansky, Orshansky Transmission Corp.; and William E. Weseloh, Rohr Industries. The purpose of this paper is to show the advantages of multirange hydromechanical transmissions and to show some basic relationships of primary design parameters. Hydromechanical transmissions can be designed so that they maintain a high efficiency over a wide range of torque/speed variations. The amount of volumetric loss and, therefore, slip, can be reduced to a minimum; therefore, it is possible to control the speed of the powerplant by proper ratio control. The powerplant and transmission can be considered as one system which is permitted to operate, under optimum conditions, irrespective of the road load or speed of the vehicle. Discussion: Robert D. Barrett, International Harvester Co.; Authors' Closure 1972 SA E Transactions 720725. Designing a Hydromechanical Transmission for Heavy Duty Trucks. William A. Ross, Sundstrand Corp. A new automatic transmission for heavy-duty trucks is going into production. It is a dual mode, hydromechanical transmission, incorporating a control system to minimize engine fuel consumption. The size, weight, and price are generally competitive with other automatic and manual transmissions. 720726. Development of a Hydromechanical Steering Transmission. Robert J. Dorgan, Russell L. Rio and David M. Latson, U.S. Army Tank-Au- tomotive Command. The advantages of infinitely variable ratio steering and propulsion for track laying vehicles are well known. Studies and demonstrator programs in the past decade have indicated that the hydromechanical transmission has the most promise of providing infinitely variable ratio for military vehicles. In 1966 the Army launched a program to develop the hydromechanical transmission to "production ready" status. This paper describes that program, the transmission selected, and some of the problems en- countered in the transition from the demonstrator stage to one of readiness for military application. 720727. Rotary Brush Air Cleaner for Gas Turbine Engines. D. K. Werle and J. D. Stockham, ITT Research Institute. A parametric study was made of the variables associated with a rotary brush air cleaner for helicopter gas turbine engines. Tests were conducted at air volumes ranging 3000-8000 ftVmin and brush speeds of 1200-3000 rpm. While centrifugal effects were found to be an important cleaning mechanism, impaction effects significantly im- proved dust separation at brush speeds above 2400 rpm. On a constant impaction area basis, brushes with 1 mm diameter wires were more efficient than brushes with 2 mm wires. Wires added in the axial direction were more effective than wires added in a radial direction. Separation efficiency at 8000 ftVmin of dust laden air and brush speeds of 3000 rpm approached 100% for size classified test dusts in the 15-35/jtm size range. The separation efficiency on a 2.7 /mi mass mean diameter test dust was a respectable 66%. Only 7 hp was required to rotate the brush shaft at 3000 rpm; the pressure drop of 4 in of H20 was independent of brush speed. 720728. Approaches to Design of Low-Emission Gas- Turbine Combustion Chambers. Donald M. Dix and K. Karl Bastress, Northern Res. and Engrg. Corp. The elements and results of a technical approach to the design of low-emission gas-turbine combustors are de- scribed. The role of emissions modeling, the major features of an emissions model, the integration of conventional combustor design methodology with an emissions model, and the application of the combined methodology to specific design approaches are examined. The results indicate that emissions models that include nonuniformity of local gas conditions are of immediate 173</page><page sequence="99">720730-720736 174 utility in the design process, but that further effort in relating this nonuniformity to both conventional design parameters and conventional performance parameters is required. Applications to specific design approaches indicate that very limited emission reduction is obtainable by purely aerodynamic means and that improved fuel injection offers more potential for emission reduction, but that the most stringent emission standards will require either variable-air-distribution or variable-fuel-distribu- tion combustors. 1972 SA E Transactions 720730. The BF - Onan's New Twin Cylinder Garden Tractor Engine. Orien A. Kruse, Onan Div., Onan Corp. Onan's new 40 in3, heavy-duty, air-cooled gasoline engine offers advantages of 2-cyl configuration in a size range formerly dominated by single-cylinder engines. The twin-cylinder-opposed design results in a compact, quiet, extremely smooth-running engine, easily adaptable to garden tractor installations. The engine features an aluminum die-cast cylinder block. Aluminum die castings are used extensively throughout the design. All components are well tooled for low-cost, high-volume production. A variety of options are available, allowing tailoring the engine to meet the garden tractor manufacturers' specific requirements. 720731. Determining Critical Whirl Speeds for Outboard Motor Crankshaft Flywheel Assembly. Robert T. Larsen, Outboard Marine Corp.; and Arthur Sorenson, Jr., University of Wisconsin. The current study proceeds from an experimental obser- vation of crankshaft flywheel whirl to the satisfactory development of a method of analysis. It aims to establish the most simplistic approach compatible with system behavior. The results of this study point to a mathematical model based upon a rigid disk whirling about the end of a flexible shaft. The proposed model represents a sensible compromise between accuracy and simplicity, which leads to a simple expression for the critical whirl speeds in terms of the most significant system parameters. 1972 SAE Transactions 720732. Small Engine Design Using Adaptive Control Design Optimization Technique. Eldon J. Reynolds and John J. Allan, III, The University of Texas at Austin. Advances in low cost digital computing have spawned new design techniques. One of these, design optimization by adaptive control (DOAC), is explained. Modeling an entire system to optimize one component has many disadvantages. When using the ideas presented here, a component is removed from a physical system and replaced with a minicomputer, D/A and A/D hardware, transducers, and an adaptive simulation algorithm. The adaptive algorithm can then optimize the com- ponent design using real time performance data. An example implementation dealing with a small recipro- cating internal combustion engine, and some possible future applications, are discussed. 720733. Bearing Noise Reduction. Loren E. Lura and Robert B. Walker, New Departure-Hyatt Bear- ings Div., General Motors Corp. Bearing noise may result from variable processing tech- niques and/or improper application practices. Examples are cited, and methods for measuring bearing sound level are described. It is shown that both the bearing manu- facturer and the user have a responsibility in eliminating conditions which may contribute to noisy bearing oper- ation. 720734. Bevel and Hypoid Gear Noise Reduction. LeRoy S. Pitts, Gleason Works. Vibrations created by the meshing action of bevel and hypoid gears operating in a drive system often result in gear noise. This paper discusses the origin of those vibrations and the various parameters which affect them. It also outlines techniques for analyzing vibrations during manufacture and gear noise in the vehicle. 720735. Transmission Noise Reduction. Terry A. Dunlap and William G. Halvorsen, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. This paper discusses the nature of noise production of automotive transmissions and the various measures which may be taken to reduce operating noise. The measures discussed include investigation and modification of the gear shaft system dynamics in both bending and torsion. Also discussed are determination of dynamic character- istics of the transmission housing and ways of reducing the levels of vibration of housing areas and of decreasing the radiation efficiency of those areas. 720736. A Compound Cycle Employing Two-Stage Com- bustion to Reduce Automotive Air Pollution. Reiner Decher, Richard C. Corlett and Abra- ham Hertzberg, University of Washington. This paper presents a compound engine concept that has the potential of significantly reducing exhaust emissions. This cycle is based on a combination of components of the spark-ignition engine and the gas turbine. The cycle utilizes a two-stage combustion process involving fuel-rich combustion at high temperatures to reduce NOx formation and followed by lean burning to eliminate unburned hydrocarbons in a thermodynamically productive manner. A thermodynamic analysis of this cycle and a comparison with the conventional otto cycle is presented. The combustion processes involved are examined and methods of implementing this cycle in a practical manner are shown. The results of this analysis indicate that a practical automotive power cycle with excellent part load and transient response characteristics is possible via this approach.</page><page sequence="100">720737-720743 720737. Simulation of a Two-Stage Rotary Van Steam Expander. Itzhak Ben-Bassat and Carl H. Wolgemuth, The Pennsylvania State University. The purpose of this work was to develop a tool for evaluating the performance of different positive-dis- placement steam expanders. The model reported here allows for two stages of expansion, friction, and heat transfer. The equations developed include also the transient charging and exhaust processes, but do not include the inertia effects in the fluid. These equations are in dimensionless form and the solutions are applicable to all expanders of this type. If expanders of different geometry are to be considered, only the volume equations must be changed to obtain a simulation. The performance (work output and adiabatic expansion efficiency) is shown as a function of breathing number and arcs of admission and exhaust. 720738. The External Combustion Piston Engine (ECPE). Harvey W. Welsh and Robert A. Yano, Thermo Mechanical Systems Co. The External Combustion Piston Engine (ECPE) is a new and unusual powerplant concept which is intended to improve the performance and emissions of conventional reciprocating piston engines in the power class which is needed for automobiles. Under contract to the U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command and the Environmental Protection Agency (Office of Air Programs), the analysis and preliminary design of a 160 bhp, 6-cyl engine with a low-emission external burner was undertaken. The study has shown that the ECPE powerplant is a potential solution to the present air pollution problem. 720739. New Bearing Concepts for Gas Turbines. Elie B. Arwas, John M. McGrew and Leo W. Winn, Mechanical Technology Inc. This paper surveys two bearing approaches that may be considered for gas turbine applications. The first is the hybrid bearing which uses a fluid film in parallel or in series with the rolling-element bearing, and whose objec- tive is to increase the L10 life of the rolling-element bearing in high-load and/or high-speed applications. In the parallel arrangement this objective is sought by load sharing between the fluid-film and rolling-element bearing components. In the series arrangement, the objective is sought by achieving a decrease in the effective speed of the rolling-element bearing. The series approach also provides radial, viscous, damping, and this paper derives the relationships necessary for such design. The second approach is the use of gas bearings as a solution to problems of high-temperature operation. The merits and potential problem areas of gas bearings in advanced gas turbine applications are discussed and some appropriate gas bearing types are described. Discussion: H. J. Wood, H. J. Wood and Associates.; Authors' Closure 1972 SA E Transactions 720740. Low-Cost Fluid Film Bearings for Gas Turbine Engines. J. M. Ross, Gould Inc. This paper deals with the use of low-cost hydrodynamic bearings in high-speed rotor systems. The Advantages of these bearings, included reduced noise, damped vibration, and long life, make them attractive candidates for gas turbine engines. Several designs are discussed in detail, such as axial groove, three-lobe, full floating, and tilting pad bearings. Material and construction requirements are also covered. 1972 SA E Transactions 720741. Flexible Rotor Balancing of a High-Speed Gas Turbine Engine. Neville F. Rieger and Robert H. Badgley, Mechanical Technology Inc. The need for balancing a high-speed rotor in a manner that accounts for its speed-dependent deformations is discussed. The influence coefficient method of flexible rotor balancing is described with reference to the balancing of an advanced gas turbine engine rotor. This engine rotor-bearing system is then studied in detail as an application of flexible rotor balancing, using the influence coefficient method. The relative effectivenss of various combinations of balance speeds and numbers of balance planes is compared. 720742. Optimizing Tire and Machine Relationships for Maximum Performance. R. N. Klaas, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper lays out some guidelines for selecting the proper tire for off-the-road vehicles and then maintaining those tires so the machine-tire relationship is optimized for maximum performance. Essentially, this involves selecting the proper size tire, choosing the best available tire design, construction, and compound compromise for specific job requirements, and finally following good maintenance practices on each unit. 720743. Traction and Flotation Characteristics of Earth- mover Tires on Soft Soil. Masatoshi Satake and Tsuneo Mukai, Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd. (Japan). The problems due to the soft soil often found at job sites in Japan call for a tire superior in traction and flotation to be used in wheel-type earthmovers. We have developed several types of experimental tires by applying various theories about such influences on the characteristics of tires as configuration of the tire, internal structure, and design of the tread. Tests on such experimental tires have been conducted with a new machine for evaluating the traction and flotation of earthmover tires. After careful experimentation and testing, we for- mulated a theory, which is a slight modification of Bekker's experimental formula, and this theory has been proved to be applicable to common practices in the field. 1972 SA E Transactions 175</page><page sequence="101">720744-720754 176 720744.

A relatively new technique for combining fiberglass reinforcements and polyester resins into reinforced plastic parts has given reinforced thermosets the capability of approximating metal finishes. This material is sheet molding compound, commonly called SMC. It has been used successfully in large quantities by automotive companies for the past four years.

Technical Aspects of 2-Stroke Cycle Snowmobile Engines. Tetsuzo Fujikawa, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. This paper describes aspects of the Kawasaki two-stroke engines for snowmobiles. Generally speaking, in order to obtain good results in developing engines for snow- mobiles, it is important not only to investigate the engines themselves, but also to match their performance with those of the snowmobile, including their power-trans- mitting system. Kawasaki has developed an ignition system for firing two plugs per cylinder, which prevents abnormal com- bustion and results in higher performance. 720751. Sound Attenuation After the Fact. James Giovanetto and Carl Kacynski, Westinghouse Air Brake Co. The noise levels of earthmoving equipment, in the operator's cab and outside the machine, are discussed. Ways and means of lowering the dB ratings for increased operator and bystander comfort are taken into account. Suggestions are made for ways of mounting the cab itself and lessening vibratory reactions from the engine, in- cluding rubber engine and cab mounts, plus acoustical material for reducing inside the cab noise. 720752. Noise Control at the Operator's Area on Large Farm Tractors with Cabs. Donald R. Hartdegen and Herbert G. Akins, International Harvester Co. Developing procedures for evaluating and reducing operator's noise levels is a common challenge for all machine manufacturers. Although individual approaches will vary with each individual, industry, or equipment type, the end result is a method to evaluate and develop the control of noise. One such approach used on large farm tractors with cabs is described in this paper. It describes the application of general sound control theory and some of the benefits obtained. Each modification made on the product has its own unique procedure for analysis. This paper does not assume these procedures will solve other noise problems, but they can be used as a guide. 720753. Automatic Shift Control for Heavy Duty Trans- missions. J. W. Schmidt, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Through the years, changes have occurred in vehicle design that have necessitated a re-evaluation of trans- mission shift systems. Vehicle trends have been towards increased size, articulation, and multipower usage. Me- chanical linkages for these vehicles have become costly to design and build, and are troublesome to maintain due to wear, improper adjustment, and damage. In 1968 an electric shift control concept was intro- duced for the off-highway heavy duty transmission market to eliminate the problems associated with mechanical, hydraulic, and air linkages. This system consisted pri- marily of three components: shift tower, wiring harness, and range selector control valve body. Now a new electronic shift control has been developed which enables the transmission with electric shift to achieve the optimum in fully automatic operation. The electronic control ensures that all shifts occur at optimum speeds, eases driver operation, and provides a unit that is precise, reliable, maintenance-free, and adaptable to large and complex vehicles. The new shift control is of interest, as described in this paper, because of the complexity of combining electronics and hydraulics to automate the shifting of the heavy duty transmission. 720754.

The WABCO model 3200 3 axle, 200 ton mining truck was announced in the fall of 1971. It employs a 2000 hp electromechanical drive system to power tandem rear axles. The power train consists of an EMD 12-645-E4 900 rpm locomotive type engine, generator, controls and two drive motors. Each tandem axle has one motor, which drives the wheels through a reduction gear set, a differential, and planetaries.

Exhaust Emission Control in Medium Swirl Rate Direct Injection Diesel Engines. Robert F. Parker and James W. Walker, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. This paper reports test work conducted on a family of medium swirl, direct injection diesel engines in the 50-200 hp range, typical of those used in FCIM equipment. An analysis of emissions reporting techniques is discussed, including a comparison of on-highway and agricultural weighting factors for the 13 mode cycle. Naturally aspirated, turbocharged, and turbocharged-intercooled versions of a basic engine family are compared, along with possible emissions reductions by exhaust gas recirculation on a naturally aspirated engine and retarded injection timing on turbocharged engines. The increase in fuel cost for N02 reduction by retarded timing is presented. 720756. Combustion System Parameters and Their Effect Upon Diesel Engine Exhaust Emissions. Rudolf Pischinger, Technical University of Graz, Aus- tria; and Wolfgang Cartellieri, AVL - Institute Prof. List (Austria). Exhaust emission characteristics of a production auto- motive diesel engine were studied. The particular engine was chosen because it is being marketed with a pre- chamber as well as with a direct-injection combustion system and, in both configurations, either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. In addition, an aftercooler was fitted to the turbocharged direct-injection engine. Methods for reducing exhaust emissions are discussed. A brief survey is given of potential emission control by catalytic converter, exhaust recirculation, and LPG dual-fuel operation. Basic investigations, conducted on single-cylinder direct-injection (DI) engines are reported. It is concluded that direct injection is the most promising combustion system for low-emission commer- cial automotive diesel engines, particularly when turbo- charged and aftercooled, and that this type of engine can satisfy the 1975 California standards.

Diesel Emissions as Predictors of Observed Diesel Odor. Harry E. Dietzmann and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Ralph C. Stahman, Environmental Protection Agency. The use of diesel exhaust-emissions measurements to predict the observed odor from diesel engine exhaust has been studied, using a group of 31 trucks and buses powered by a variety of diesel engines. Regression analysis of gaseous emissions at a variety of conditions has resulted in equations for use in predicting odor. Acrolein, carbon dioxide, total hydrocarbons, selected light hydrocarbons, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and aliphatic aldehydes have been related to perceived odor. Some of these exhaust products are odorous and some are nonodorous yet indicative of the completeness of com- bustion. The empirical method, however, is somewhat less reliable than the observed odor based on a trained panel rating supra-threshold levels in terms of the PHS Quality- Intensity Odor Rating kit. In general, the greater variety of measurements and the fewer type of engines will increase odor prediction accuracy. Discussion: Philip L. Levins, Arthur D.

Amann, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Concern over exhaust emissions has revived interest in the gas turbine as a powerplant for passenger cars, and concern over cost has stimulated interest in the single- shaft version of this engine. A novel transmission is needed to compensate for the inherently poor output characteristics of the single-shaft engine. The rated power and response time of the engine and the efficiency and power split of the transmission are shown to be the primary parameters influencing vehicle acceleration. Some factors affecting engine response time are reviewed. Transmission parameters are studied by considering standing-start accelerations of an automobile powered by a fixed-geometry single-shaft engine using versions of three of the many types of possible transmissions. For the combinations considered, the fixed-geometry single-shaft engine cannot easily provide vehicle performance match- ing that of the traditional two-shaft turbine engine, if both start with the compressor idling at half rated speed. Higher idle speed improves engine acceleration but increases idle fuel consumption. Any cost advantage realized through selection of a single-shaft engine must be balanced against the cost of the transmission chosen to accommodate engine output characteristics. Discussion: David W.

A new power systems evaluation technique was developed to compare average fuel consumption and output power capability between different systems. Many combinations of engines, transmissions, and control systems could be represented by a modular general-purpose powertrain simulator. The torque and speed requirements of a vehicle were represented with a stochastic model. This technique was applied to the selection of a gas turbine transmissions system for an off-road vehicle. 177</page><page sequence="103">720760-720769 178 720760. A Review of Solid Waste Collection in the United States - 1800-1950. Harvey W. Rogers, Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. The problem of solid waste collection in the United States is not a new one. The problems of equipment stan- dardization, vectors, aesthetics, and dust and odor control, to mention a few, were approached systematically as the need was recognized. This paper described the transition from past to present collection practices. This devel- opmental transition can serve as good background information upon which to build future collection tech- nology. 720761. The Refuse Challenge - Today's Problem. George Edema, Browning Ferris Industries, Inc. The solid waste disposal industry in the United States is confronted with a tremendous challenge. While being transformed, almost overnight, into a sophisticated or- ganization of collectors and disposers, having to adhere to new and complex environmental laws, we are handling even greater demands for service. New laws and regu- lations are being enacted so rapidly that many of our present methods of operating, and our present equipment, are being made obsolete before we can develop suitable replacements. The energy and talents of the automotive and supporting industries are urgently needed to design and produce new types of collection equipment that will be economical, safe, and capable of meeting this ever growing challenge. 720762. The Refuse Challenge Material Handling Prob- lems of Collection - The Future. Eugene J. Wingerter, National Solid Wastes Management Association. Within the past 15 years, the solid wastes management field has experienced an extensive technological ad- vancement. This advancement has brought the field into parity with other segments of the materials handling and construction industries. During the coming decade the solid wastes industry will experience a continual tech- nological refinement and maturity in areas of waste collection, transfer systems, resource recovery, and dis- posal. The rapidly expanding demands for service com- bined with the constraints for economical systems for waste management will accelerate the automation of selected processes formerly based upon labor intensive procedures. This paper highlights the current state- of-the-art for waste management and identifies areas where technological improvements could lead to signif- icant manpower and productivity achievements in the field. 720765. ATV Flotation Tires. M. L. Pules and D. J. Eves, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Flotation tires on all-terrain vehicles (ATV) are an essential component for good, overall off-the-road mobil- ity. Water displacement by the large volume tires provide additional buoyancy for amphibious vehicles. The large contact area of the deflected tire provides low ground pressure for flotation on soft ground. ATV tires are a special breed of tires with design features for better mobility such as carcass flexibility, wide tire section, and special tread design. 720766. Rubber Propulsion Tracks for All Terrain Vehi- cles. M. W. King, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A rubber track has been developed for use on all-terrain vehicles (ATV).

This track uses a series of internal lugs for propulsion and can be manufactured with any desirable tread pattern. This paper will present the advantages and some of the technical aspects of this track. 720767. Hydraulic Rotary Vane Type Actuators and Their Application to Farm and Industrial Machinery. David J. Cronberger, Houdaille Hydraulics. The rotary actuator, a device which converts hydraulic fluid under pressure into rotary mechanical motion, is very useful in applications that require limited turning motion. Several applications are described in this paper, and illustrations are presented. Descriptions of the two basic types of rotary actuators, the vane and the piston, are offered. The latter type is further divided into the helical-spline, piston-rack, and piston-chain. 720768. Dynamic Considerations in the Application of Hydraulic Motors. Richard A. Klimaszewski, Vickers Div., Sperry Rand Corp. Speed and pressure response of a hydraulic motor to changes in flow (stroking a directional valve) is predicted for typical mobile hydraulic circuits. A simplified ap- proach was used to derive the equations for a system consisting of a pump, directional valve, and a motor with an inertia load. The speed and pressure response to increases in flow was studied by solving the equations on an analog computer. Expressions for the natural frequency, con, and the damping ratio, f, were written in terms of motor displacement, load inertia, system compliance, and system leakage coefficient. The response to increases in flow is presented in terms of the damping ratio. The response to decreases in flow is discussed for directional valves with both open and closed cylinder ports. The effects of the simplifying assumptions of the valve stroking rate and of the valve cylinder port configuration are discussed. 1972 SA E Transactions 720769.

Hydrostatics has been employed throughout for transmission of engine power. Required for the new design concept was a rotary hydraulic union with capacity for 50 gpm and 4700 psi. Problems related to the hydrostatic transmission, drive tire, and controls were solved, resulting in a durable and efficient compac- tion tool. 720772. Twin-Powered Self-Loading Scrapers. Ronald G. Rumpf, Westinghouse Air Brake Co. Twin-powered self-loading scrapers are relatively new in the construction equipment field. The high horsepower to weight ratios coupled with all-wheel drive give two axle scrapers excellent performance in the cut, on the haul road, and in the fill area. Self-loading is accomplished with heavy-duty elevator systems. Loading time and distance is less than that experienced with single engine elevating scrapers. This type of equipment, in the 20 and 30 yd3 class, is geared to handle a wide variety of construction and mining production jobs and has long since graduated from the "cleanup tool" and "potato dirt" type equipment. 720773. Designing the JD740 Skidder. L. E. Miller, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. The forestry products manufacturers are being forced by economic pressures into producing wood handling equip- ment of larger capacity and more efficient operation. Consequently, four-wheel drive articulated skidders of larger sizes and increased horsepower are being designed and built. John Deere's JD740 Skidder is one of these units. This paper presents the design features of the JD740 and discusses aspects of these features important in their selection to meet the original design goals. 720774. The 528 Wheel Skidder. Rodney H. Anderson and George R. Heidenblut, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The 528 wheel skidder represents a second-generation machine designed and tested to satisfy the requirements of the large wood areas of the world. Numerous unique features were incorporated in the design to meet the special needs of the logging customer; these are described, along with the development program that yielded the present vehicle. 720775. More Efficient Combustion in Small Open Cham- ber Diesel Engines. R. E. Vanderpoel, American Bosch Corp.; J. M. Rife and A. R. Rogowski, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Uniti quite recently, it appeared that there was an effective lower limit on bore size in open-chamber diesel engines. This paper presents a technique for improving combustion in the small open-chamber diesel engine. Recent work at MIT on a 2-V2 in bore, short-stroke diesel engine has demonstrated that good efficiency can be obtained through a combination of a large-hole nozzle and the use of air swirl to prevent overpenetration. There is some indication that good efficiency can be obtained over a wider operating range than standard diesel practice. A method of design analysis for this type of engine is presented, along with techniques for estimating the swirl and nozzle design parameters. 720776. Comparison of the Various Correlations for Spray Penetration. N. Hay and P. L. Jones, University of Nottingham (England). A survey of spray literature has been carried out in order to find all those works containing a theoretical or experimental correlation of spray penetration variables. Twelve such works were found. Three hypothetical sets of conditions based on actual data from the Sulzer LVA24 diesel engine are used to test the correlations. The results obtained from applying the three sets of conditions are given as penetration-time curves. The effects of injection pressure, air density, and nozzle orifice diameter on the penetration predicted by each correlation, are also shown in penetration-time curves. An analysis of the results leads to several conclusions from which recommendations are made as to whether each correlation is suitable for use under conditions prevailing in modern diesel engines. Future trends in medium speed diesel engine conditions show that all but 179</page><page sequence="105">720777-720783 180 two of the twelve correlations will not give satisfactory predictions of penetration under these conditions. 720777. Development of a Fuel Filter and Water Sepa- rator for Diesel Engines. Vernon D. Roosa, Stanadyne, Inc.; and David H. Hodgkins* Hartford Div., Stanadyne, Inc. A new fuel filter by Stanadyne is described. Its devel- opment, including shape and paper selection, is covered. The Master filter makes use of unusual packaging concepts and techniques to overcome the ever-increasing problem of short filter life as diesel engine horsepower increases. Fuel filter paper evaluation, selection, and test results are described. Comparisons of, and arguments for, more realistic filter test methods are provided. Supplementing the fuel filter is a new type of water separator using similar packaging concepts. This simple design provides very good capability for water removal at high flow rates. A water separator test method is outlined. Both products offer contaminant visibility to en- courage system maintenance. 1972 SA E Transactions 720778. Versatility in Compensated Hydraulic Circuits. Leonard Reimer, Cessna Fluid Power Div., Cessna Corp. A compensated hydraulic system is a system in which the pump automatically compensates or reacts, usually by a change in displacement, to some change in its operating condition or to some external signal. An almost endless variety of operating characteristics to provide many conveniences is possible. Pressure- and flow-compensated systems are familiar but still have new possibilities. In addition, torque compensation, speed compensation, and various hybrid systems are not feasible. The features of several existing and proposed systems are examined in this paper. 720779. Characteristics of Compensated Pumps. Kurt R. Lonnemo, Vickers Div., Sperry Rand Corp. This paper describes the design, steady-state and typical dynamic performance characteristics of a line of pressure and flow compensated pumps. Particularly, the influence of the application parameters on the dynamic charac- teristics is discussed and illustrated. Some installation considerations are also given and a few successful applications to farm tractors, dozers, trucks and jumbo jets demonstrated. 720780. Fluid Power System Contamination Analysis. John M. Karhnak, Jr., U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Command. Over the past several years, the Army has become increasingly aware of the disastrous effect of solid particle contamination on the life and efficiency of fluid power system components. Something must be done to give a more reliable, quicker, and more accurate check on the system condition at any given time. In July 1971, the Army Mobility Equipment Com- mand acquired a prototype portable automatic particle counter for use on fluid power systems. This battery- operated counter connects directly to the vehicle or test stand at a fixed, predetermined test point, eliminating the need for sample containers and simplifying the test procedures. Connection, analysis and disconnection takes less than 5 min. The portable counter has been used on a number of vehicles with verification samples being taken and checked by Oklahoma State University. Results to date have encouraged the Mobility Equipment Command to continue with the field verification program. 1972 SA E Transactions 720781. Cummins' New 927 Cubic Inch Diesel Engine. R. E. Schumann and R. W. Jones, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. A new heavy-duty in-line 6 cyl diesel engine has been developed for the truck, construction, industrial, and marine markets. The displacement is 927 in3 with a 51/2 in bore and 6V2 in stroke, with naturally aspirated ratings of 240 and 260 SAE hp at 2100 rpm. The design is based on a currently successful 855 in3 engine and includes design changes in many basic components, such as angle drilled crankshaft, offset drilled rod, revised water and lube system, and others, to improve the durability of the product. 720782. Scania's New DS14 Diesel Engine. Olle Lindgren, Scania Div., Saab-Scania. A new model of a turbocharged direct-injection diesel engine has been developed to meet present and near- future power needs for heavy-duty trucks. This paper gives a full description of the new V8 design with special emphasis on the turbocharging system including exhaust manifold arrangement and valve timing. It also covers other design features, such as Scania's unique oil filtering system, the durable cylinder head sealing arrangement, and the accessory drive. Finally, the paper deals with aspects of the development and testing program that was undertaken to attain an economic and virtually smoke- free diesel engine of high durability and reliability. 720783. Development of a Turbocharged Two-Cycle Air Cooled Diesel Engine. Tetsuya Matsumura, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. This paper describes the development of a turbocharged 2-cycle air-cooled diesel engine with 4-, 6- and 10-cyl engine series featuring unique designs in their respective component parts. Development was initially begun on a single-cylinder engine, on which tests were carried out. Following that, full-scale engine experimentation was carried out using a 4-cyl prototype engine, after which successive tests were made on each cylinder series. The turbocharged 2-cycle air-cooled diesel engine is especially noteworthy for such features of its construction as its</page><page sequence="106">720784-730792 mechanically driven exhaust turbocharger, cooling meth- ods for cylinder, cylinder head, and piston. 720784. Destructive Testing of Crane Booms. C. A. Brolin, H. E. Durscher and G. Serentha, FMC Corp. A series of tests to ultimate failure was conducted on lattice type crane booms. The results of these tests, correlated to predicted mathematical values, demonstrat- ed that ultimate load capacity can be predicted accurately and that SAE J987, "Crane Structures - Method of Test" results in proper but probably conservative ratings. The proposed SAE Recommended Practice, "Latticed Crane Booms - Analytical Determination of Stresses and Critical Loads," appears to give reasonable ratings when com- pared to actual failure loads. This work and results presented suggest that the day may come when such structures can be rated based on ultimate or critical load rather than on critical stress. Discussion: Howard I. Shapiro, Charles M. Shapiro &amp; Sons. 1972 SAE Transactions 720785. High-Pressure Technology. Bernard Triai and David Jezwinski, American Poclain Corp. High-pressure hydraulic systems (operating at pressures of 3500 psi or greater) are replacing mechanical systems with smaller and more reliable machines. This paper discusses the existing limitations of the technology of high-pressure hydraulics, as well as the advantages of systems working at pressures in the area of 5000 psi. An analysis is made of an hydraulic circuit and its components, including the reservoir, pump, valves, motor, cylinders, hoses, and fluid. 720786. The Hoist Dynamometer - An Instrument for Full Scale Evaluation of Band Brake Materials. Joseph Fox and Luft A. Alvi, Raybestos- Manhattan, Inc. This paper describes a hoist dynamometer capable of reproducing field conditions for the purpose of providing comparative data on friction materials used on band brakes and clutches by the crane and hoist industry. Performance qualities essential to the braking system are recorded for both automatic and manual operation. The dynamometer enables the testing to be performed under controlled conditions which can be both repetitive and reproducible. 720787. Development of a Hydraulic Excavator for the World Market. F. E. Simpson, Caterpillar Trac- tor Co. The recently announced Model 225 Excavator is Cater- pillar Tractor Co.'s initial entry into the hydraulic excavator market. The development program for this machine was designed, from the beginning, to achieve a machine well suited not only to the United States but to overseas markets. Major features of the vehicle, and how these features were affected by unique aspects of the development program, are discussed. 720788. Case's New 580 CK Loader-Backhoe Model B. Roy A. Gillette, J. I. Case Co. The design changes made on the 14 ft Case 580B backhoe-loader to upgrade its overall performance level are described in this paper. Increased productivity was obtained by use of a higher horsepower engine, adoption of twin boom cylinders, improvement of bucket digging power, addition of an optional attachment, and provision of tow position stabilizers with lock checks on the cylinders. Lift capacity of the loader was also increased. A new operator seat was designed and various modifications made to provide easier operation. Ease of maintenance and repair was also improved. Optional equipment for the backhoe-loader is also described. 720789. The 3400 and 3500 International Industrial Loader-Backhoe Machines. W. F. Klaviter and R. D. Moore, International Harvester Co. Two high performance industrial machines, the 3400 and 3500 International industrial loader-backhoe, featuring a balanced system of loader integral frame tractor and backhoe design have been introduced to the market. These combinations with matched hydraulic systems optimize operator comfort with machine durability and productivity. 720790. Case 1737/1740 Uni-Loader - Evolutionary De- sign. Maurice Klee, J. I. Case Co. Evolutionary design may be defined as up-grading an existing design to improve marketability, while still retaining fixed parameters of cost, weight, size, and related attributes. When the project involves an already well-designed and acceptable product, then further evo- lution of the design requires some novel approaches. This paper discusses the evolutionary design of compact skid-steer loaders. Powerplant, loader efficiency, service and parking brakes, and service accessibility are covered. 720791. Stabilization of a Hydro Mechanical Steering System. Christopher K. Smith, Henry R. Sebesta and James E. Bose, Oklahoma State University. The stability of a hydromechanical steering system on a rough-terrain vehicle was investigated in an effort to eliminate limit cycle oscillations and an insensitivity to small perturbations of the steering wheel. Because of constraints imposed upon the problem, the basic system configuration was considered to be fixed. A linear analysis of the system was adequate to indicate possible com- ponents for modification, and nonlinear analyses of the indicated components proved to be accurate design tools. The problem was solved by redesigning two valves and a feedback linkage. 720792. Hydraulic Poppet Valve Stability. D. E. Wandling and B. L. Johnson, Iowa State Uni- versity. 181</page><page sequence="107">720794-720800 182 This paper presents the describing equations of a pres- sure-compensated poppet valve; the magnitude and phase relationships of the open-loop system are examined, and stability predictions made, using Nyquist techniques. Effects of changing the valve mass, valve-cavity volumes, and the lengths of supply and discharge lines are discussed. Experimental data are presented on the observed system instability for various line lengths, valve-cavity volumes, and valve masses. The results of these studies are compared to the computer predictions, and other exper- imental observations are discussed. The usefulness of Nyquist's criteria in analyzing the stability of the hydraulic poppet valve is discussed with respect to the problem of determining the location of poles of the open loop. 1972 SAE Transactions 720794. Row Crop Tractor Concepts at John Deere - Generation II. Orton E. Larson and David F. Lemons, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. The agri-businessman is increasingly being faced with the need for more efficiency in his operations and an awareness of the importance of an improved working environment for himself and his workers. John Deere has introduced a new line of row crop tractors intended to help meet those requirements. Numerous details of design contribute to the major concepts of increased power in compact, maneuverable chassis, new power train options, improved operator environment, including ease of oper- ation and good serviceability. 720795. John Deere Power Trains - Quad-Range and Perma-Clutch. William A. Best, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. This paper discusses the Quad-Range transmission and Perma-Clutch power train components available on 1973 v John Deere row crop tractors. It presents the design and explores some of the development aspects of the Perma- Clutch, powershifted planetary and gear train, transmis- sion oiling system and control valves, and the unique gear shifting arrangement all which comprise the Quad-Range transmission. 720797. Progress in the Art of Coal Hauling. Jackson Medley, Kress Corp. High labor and operating costs have led to the demand for more reliable and productive equipment. OSHA is further demanding safer, quieter, and cleaner working conditions for the operator. A fleet of Kress 150- ton single unit, rear engine, bottom dump coal haulers, now in operation at the Captain Mine, are an interesting solution in meeting these demands. By eliminating the weight of the gooseneck, hitch, and tractor frame, and using 175,000 psi yield steel, these units have payload to weight ratios of approximately 3:1. This is between 60-90% improvement over conven- tionally designed tractor-trailer units. This new coal hauler design concept became possible with the development of a dual tire front axle module which includes an oleo pneumatic suspension and 90 deg steering capability. The automatically leveled suspension system has a 20 in stroke, allowing relative deflection rates 1V2 times softer than the softest passenger cars. This increases vehicle operating life, improves tire life, provides excep- tional driver comfort, and allows safe 50 mph plus operating speed. Sufficient power is available to maintain this high speed when loaded; which results in substantial productivity improvements. The engine in the rear gives 65% traction empty and 50% plus traction on grade when loaded. This engine location isolates the driver from noise and vibration. All removable components are modular. The engine module can be removed and replaced in as little as 3 h. For maximum safety, the dual accumulator hydraulic system allows normal vehicle control even when the engine is dead and one hydraulic system is inoperative. 720798. The History and Development of Minimum Performance Brake Criteria for Off-Highway Rubber Tired Vehicles. Robert C. Lehman, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. This report discusses two topics: the history and the development of the present off-highway minimum per- formance criteria for braking systems and the current activities of Subcommittee X - Vehicle Brakes - of the SAE Construction and Industrial Machinery Technical Committee. The Subcommittee has currently been developing a revision to SAE J237, Minimum Performance Criteria for Braking Systems for Off-Highway, Rubber Tired Front End Loaders and Dozers. Thé proposed revised report is included in an appendix. When approved, similar revi- sions will be made to SAE J 166, J236, and J319. The revisions cover failure of a component common to both service and emergency stopping systems, holding per- formance, system recovery, weighing accuracy, and failure of parts. The background reasons for these revisions are described. 720799. Accelerated Tractor Testing at Minimum Cost. George F. Boltz, International Harvester Co. The continual escalation of costs made it essential to reduce both the cost and time required to endurance test tractors. Emphasis is placed on methods of automation, utilization of existing equipment, and methods of safe- guarding and monitoring units which are left unattended for extended periods of time. 720800. Amplitude Distibution Analyzer for the Meas- urement of Gearing Load Spectra. R. W. Grob and L. H. Franzen, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Gearing load spectra data collected under actual working conditions help a designer predict the fatigue life of power</page><page sequence="108">720801-720807 train components. Considerable time was required in the past to collect and reduce these data to a form suitable for design use. A vehicle mounted instrumentation system consisting of a strain gaged shaft, a shaft encoder-slip ring assembly, and an amplitude distribution analyzer, was developed which performs load measurements. At the test's conclu- sion, it provides a spectrum analysis in printed histogram form. 720801. Hydraulic Excavator Control System. Gerald W. Bernhoft, Koehring Div., Koehring Co. The use of a low-pressure, low-volume pneumatic pilot system and amplifiers provides superior control of the dipper and dipper arm of a hydraulic hoe when used in conjunction with pressure-compensated four-way hy- - draulic valves. The use of a split-control regulator and pilot valve provides automatic proportioning of flow for simultaneous operation of a tilt with extend or dig functions. Since the position of the control level represents a given flow, regardless of the hydraulic load, an operator can positively proportion the speed of the dipper and dipper arm cylinders. 720802. Hydraulic Steering Control System - A Flow Amplifier Approach. John B. Waggoner, Cat- erpillar Tractor Co. Smooth, effortless steering systems for large, articulated vehicles enhance their production performance. This paper deals with the complete primary steering system and also brings into focus an approach to the current industry need for a back-up, or secondary steering system. The individual components of both primary and secondary steering systems are discussed in detail from a design and function standpoint. The overall system performance is then discussed to identify clearly the various component functions and relationships. 720803. Hydrostatic Steering Designed for Large Off- Highway Vehicles. J. L. Rau, Ross Gear Div., TRW Inc. Simplified power steering control of large off-highway vehicles still remains a formidable problem for steering system designers. Several hydraulic power steering mech- anisms presently prevail with varying envelope and performance features compromised for off-highway ap- plication. This paper describes the first low-cost positive dis- placement-type hydrostatic steering unit especially de- signed for the large off-highway vehicle industry. The basic features of the HGB hydrostatic steering system are discussed relative to set goals in each major design area. It is shown that the HGB Hydraguide meets the general requirements for a simplified high-flow hydrostatic steering unit adaptive to the off-road construction and earthmoving machine. 720804. Solid Rocket Motors for the Space Shuttle Booster. James B. Odom, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. The evolution of the booster system for the space shuttle is traced from the initial concepts employing liquid propel- lant and reusable boosters to the final selection of recoverable, solid rocket motors. The rationale associated with each of the several major decisions in the evolution process is discussed. 720805. Airbreathing Engines for Space Shuttle. Arthur J. Glassman, Warner L. Stewart and Stanley M. Nosek, Lewis Research Center, NASA. The requirements imposed on the airbreathing engines by the shuttle mission and some results from engine design studies are discussed. In particular, some of the engine system weight study results are presented, potential problem areas and required engine modifications are identified, and testing requirements for a development and qualification program are discussed. The engines of interest for the shuttle are engines that are currently being developed for other applications. The potential problems, engine modifications, and testing requirements result primarily from the new environments associated with launch, space residence, and reentry. 1972 SA E Transactions 720806. Maneuvering Engines for Space Shuttle Orbiter. Robert W. Polifka, Manned Spacecraft Center, NASA. The orbit maneuvering engines provide the propulsive thrust to increase or decrease the velocity of the space shuttle orbiter while in earth orbit. The design and operational philosophy of the shuttle vehicle and orbital maneuvering system are discussed along with the design characteristic and selection rational for the current baseline orbit maneuvering system. The need for long life and economic reusability are the new shuttle requirements which must be considered along with traditional factors such as performance, reliability, and weight. Critical development issues and potential alternate designs are also discussed. 1972 SAE Transactions 720807. Space Shuttle Orbiter Main Engine Design. W. F. Wilhelm, Rocketdyne Div., North American Rockwell Corp. A reusable, high-performance, liquid-propellant rocket engine is being developed for the Space Shuttle Orbiter vehicle. The engine is a high pressure design based on the staged combustion cycle. Control is accomplished with an electronic digital system. This controller accepts vehicle commands for start, shutdown, mixture ratio, and thrust level, plus providing appropriate signals to five major propellant valves: main fuel, main oxidizer, chamber coolant, and two preburner oxidizer valves. Many unique design features, such as regenerative cooling at high chamber pressure, a high-efficiency 183</page><page sequence="109">720808-720818 184 three-stage fuel pump, a dual-inlet oxidizer pump, and an electric control system, are incorporated to satisfy the life, performance, and reliability requirements of the Space Shuttle Orbiter Main Engine. 1972 SA E Transactions 720808. Maintainability of the Space Shuttle Orbiter Main Engine. R. T. Goe, Rocketdyne Div., North American Rockwell Corp. Previous large liquid-rocket engine check-out and main- tenance operations were mostly manual, time consuming, and costly. Using Saturn experience and guided by airline practice, the Space Shuttle Orbiter Main Engine has been designed for rapid turnaround and simple, low-cost maintenance. A streamlined operational concept and the addition of specific design features for easy maintenance were the prime factors in this accomplishment. 1972 SA E Transactions 720809. High Temperature Damping. Robert Plunkett, University of Minnesota. Porcelain enamel coatings give substantial amounts of damping at temperatures between 400-800 C depending on the particular enamel. Suitably chosen enamels can reduce the vibration amplitude at elevated temperatures and increase the fatigue life at all temperatures for those structures subject to forced vibration at resonance. Particularly suitable applications are gas turbine blades, combustion chambers, and aerodynamically heated plates and shells. 1972 SA E Transactions 720810. Modal Damping Predictions Using Substructure Testing. A. M. Ellison and W. E. Jones, Jr., Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., Inc. A method is presented for predicting the modal damping of structures using a combination of analysis and tests of substructures. Damping characteristics of simple sub- structures and joints are determined by the test program, and analysis is used to predict the modal damping coefficients as a function of the peak kinetic energy of vibration in the mode. Both the magnitude and the form of the damping can be predicted before full-scale test hardware becomes available. 720811. Effect of Additive Damping on Transfer Function Characteristics of Structures. Curtis F. Vail, General Motors Corp. The effect of viscoelastic damping on transfer function characteristics of structures is discussed. Three types of viscoelastic damping treatments were examined: free layer, constrained layer, and constrained layer spaced from the neutral axis. Structures were tested with and without damping treatments for slow sweep and fast transient sweeps at two amplitude levels. The transfer functions were calculated and used for determining the effectiveness of the treatment for reducing the response. Analysis was performed for the modal characteristics, inherent damping, additive damping, and transfer func- tions. Correlations between the predicted and test transfer function magnitudes showed the acceptability of the analysis method. 720812. Transient Dynamic Response of Viscoelastic Structures. Gregg K. Hobbs, Hughes Aircraft Co. A brief discussion of the sources of damping is given and methods of mathematically modeling the linear sources of damping are discussed. It is shown that the most general linear model corresponds to a system that is linearly viscoelastic. The technique applied in problem formula- tion are based on finite element models which utilize lumped masses. Transform and state space methods of solution are discussed and compared. Transient solutions for forcing functions of exponential order or less are given. 720813. Study of Modeling of Substructure Damping Matrices. Gary C. Hart and Jon D. Collins, J. H. Wiggins Co. Several methods are presented for developing propor- tional substructure damping matrices from modal test data. Examples demonstrate the significance of the nonuniqueness of the resulting proportional damping matrices. Several alternate modal synthesis procedures are presented for the systematic calculation of system modal damping from substructure damping information. The relative merits of these procedures are discussed, and one procedure is recommended. 1972 SA E Transactions 720815. Jet Engine Condition Monitoring Without Aids. Loren C. Ellis, United Air Lines, Inc. The aircraft engines represent from 40-60% of the total direct maintenance cost of a commercial airliner. The engines, along with tires and brakes, represent the "consumable" components on the airplane. The engine's requirement for high reliability, coupled with its ap- proximately 50% share of the aircraft maintenance cost, has required development of numerous reliability, per- formance monitoring, and inspection tools and programs to assure its good health at minimum cost. Engine performance monitoring is one of the pro- grams that has been developed. The scope of in-flight engine performance monitoring ranges from a slide rule in the cockpit to a completely instrumented engine mon- itored by an onboard computer. This paper will review United Air Lines' engine monitoring program, which is a compromise between the slide rule and the onboard computer. The flight log monitoring program is reviewed and UAL's decisions not to install AIDS are explained. 720818. System Monitoring Techniques - Practical Ap- plications and Experience at Eastern - Jet En- gines. John J. Dziuba, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. Jet engine maintenance philosophy is rapidly changing</page><page sequence="110">720819-720827 from "hard time" between overhaul to "on-condition." The on-condition philosophy has placed added emphasis on the ability to monitor the condition of installed engines. This paper reviews monitoring techniques utilized by Eastern and presents several case studies involving their use. Other techniques which were evaluated and rejected by Eastern are also discussed. 1972 SAE Transactions 720819. Computer-Controlled Environmental Test Sys- tems: Criteria for Selection, Installation, and Maintenance. C. P. Chapman, California Insti- tute of Technology. Digital computer-controlled environmental test systems, originally developed for random vibration testing, can also be used for sine-wave testing, for large-scale time series analysis and presentation, for simulated natural environment testing (for example, temperature, pressure, and humidity), and for related applications. Costs and requirements for such systems are discussed; costs level off with multiapplications. Organizational changes, in both personnel and plant facility, must be considered. Additional development and modification of the control logic programs is an important capability after delivery. Control loop speed constraints are considerations for real-time test control. Tradeoffs must be made for the input-output devices and word storage. Reliability main- tainability, and personnel training are important param- eters that are also discussed. 1972 SA E Transactions 720820. Evolution of Digital Vibration System. Charles L. Heizman and Edwin A. Sloane, Time/Data Corp. Digital vibration control systems are discussed in this paper, from their inception to the present. Current models include sine, transient or shock, and random test features. The current state-of-the-art in commercial vibration control systems is presented, with a summary of their performance and features. Future systems are discussed, showing the trend in control developments that will permit practical implementation of multichannel and multiaxis control. The use of digital vibration for design is discussed, whereby testing and evaluation can together modify original designs. 720821. Field Experience with Digital Control Systems for Vibration and Acoustic Testing. Francis C. Bosso, Alfred G. Ratz and Stephen F. Sullivan, MB Electronics. This paper discusses fully-developed digital control systems used in vibration testing. The fundamentals of control are presented, along with a discussion of the final systems evolved. Of particular importance is the need to fully exploit the new levels of automation and safety available when computers are used. Performance is demonstrated using the results of operational tests. 720823. Control of Electrohydraulic Shaker by Digital Iteration Techniques. George C. Kao and Kurng Y. Chang, Wyle Labs. The paper presents the results of a feasibility and conceptual study for on-line transient waveform control of nonlinear electrohydraulic test systems. The control concept is based on digital computing algorithms and the reciprocal properties of the fast Fourier transform used in the time-invarient vibratory system approach. In order to reproduce a specified time history at the test specimen, digital iteration techniques, which compensate the fre- quency coupling and the effects of nonlinearities on the electrical and mechanical components of the vibratory system, were used to define the test system transfer function. Successful control of prototype test systems are presented and discussed. 720824. The Development and Use of Aircraft Derivative Turbines in Industrial and Marine Applications. David A. Nazzaro and James T. Geis, Turbo Power and Marine Systems, Inc. This paper describes the initiation, development, and future outlook for the aircraft derivative gas turbine in ground-based applications. A short synopsis of the current applications of the gas turbine is given along with its accomplishments to date. Specific emphasis is placed on the development of the required technology as set forth by the demands of the electric utility industry. 720825. The Industrial Jet Gas Turbine for Base Load Applicationa. Robert Harnsberger, Cooper-Bes- semer Co. The application of jet gas turbines to industrial uses of all types has been a successful venture in its short history of 12 years. Through this effort, aircraft technologies and practices have been found to blend well to the require- ments of the stationary ground-based gas turbine. For those unfamiliar to the subject, the paper presents an overview of the jet gas turbine as an industrial product, the applications and gas generator models involved in this activity, and the maintenance concept which is unique in the industry. 1972 SAE Transactions 720826. Aero Engines for Navy Shipboard Use. G. M. Boatwright, Naval Ship Systems Command. The primary purpose of this paper is to describe the application of two aero derivative gas turbine engines to the DD963 Spruance class of destroyers. Some of the effects of these applications on other portions of the ship, on training, on maintenance and other logistics will be discussed. Also several other proposed shipbuilding programs expected to use gas turbine propulsion will be mentioned. 1972 SAE Transactions 720827.

Solar gas turbines have been used in a large variety of applications in three basic packaging configurations - natural gas compressor, electrical generator, and me- chanical drive (pump). This paper notes a number of specific applications, including gas transmission, oil pumping, tanker loading, refrigeration and air condi- tioning, telecommunications, standby power, etc. The examples illustrate the gas turbines advantages with respect to high power-to-weight ratios, low vibration, high reliability, compactness, unattended operation ability to operate in extreme climatic conditions, and economic heat recovery. 720828. U.S. Army's 1500-SHP Demonstrator Engine Program - Some Lessons Learned. Nicholas C. Kailos and Paul Chesser, U.S. Army Air Mobil- ity Research and Development Lab. Development of the U.S. Army's 1500-shp advanced technology demonstrator engines was initiated in 1967. Presented are several lessons of a technical and non- technical nature learned from the program. Several problem areas encountered are highlighted and analyzed. Reflected is the need for standardization within the industry of methods of bookkeeping component effi- ciencies and of conducting engine performance analysis. Scheduling, development approach, and instrumentation experiences and requirements are also discussed. 720830. Evolution of Small Turboshaft Engines. Max Bentele and Justin J. Laborde, Lycoming Div., Avco Corp. There is an ever increasing interest in the small, under 1000 hp, turboshaft engine for use as aircraft propulsion powerplants. This paper discusses the historical evolution of these powerplants, their current state-of-the-art, and their future potential. The effect of a continually ad- vancing technology on the performance, weight, and cost of these engines is discussed. The level of technology in the small gas turbine engine is compared to that of larger engines, pointing out some of the technical differences resulting from engine size effects. The interaction of engine performance, cost, weight, reliability, and main- tainability is discussed; and some of the potential trade-offs between these areas are presented. 1972 SA E Transactions 720831. Small Turbine Advanced Gas Generator for Future Propulsion Requirements. Edward T. Johnson and Millard L. Pedersen, U.S. Army Air Mobility Research and Development Lab. On November 30, 1971, the Eustis Directorate of the U.S. Army Air Mobility Research and Development Labo- ratory issued four contracts for the design, fabrication, and testing of the Small Turbine Advanced Gas Gener- ator (STAGG). The ST AGG airflow range is approxi- mately 1-5 lb/s. The purpose of the STAGG program is to provide the core gas generator technology base for future small gas turbine engine programs for the Department of Defense (DOD) as well as the Army. The STAGG program will incorporate advanced component technol- ogy into a gas generator in order to define matching and integration problems at an early date, thereby reducing gas turbine engine development time and cost. STAGG is a core gas generator (gas producer) with the compressor, combustor, turbine, and bearings and seals as prime interest areas. It includes laboratory (slave) inlet, exhaust nozzle, lubrication system, and fuel control system necessary for operation and testing. Two contracts are in the 1-2 and two contracts are in the 3-5 lb/s airflow size. The gas generators will not include accessory drive or power turbine systems. 720834. Design and Analysis of an APU Monopropellant Gas Generator. R. D. Marcy and J. P. Maddox, Rocketdyne Div., North American Rockwell Corp. The performance, mechanical integrity, and operational characteristics of a monopropellant thermal gas generator have been predicted using analytical tools developed through the use of digital and analog computer programs. The basis for these analyses are empirical relationships derived from experiments, as well as theoretical relations. A throtteable prototype gas generator has been designed and fabricated to meet the requirements of an APU for use in the space shuttle vehicle. 1972 SA E Transactions 720835. Turbomachinery Design for Space Shuttle Aux- iliary Power Systems. W. L. Burriss and B. H. Rowlett, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. The two major factors that affect auxiliary power system design decisions are: the working fluid to be used and vehicle mission requirements. It has been found that optimum turbine designs will be similar for the two working fluids (hydrazine or hydrogen-oxygen) consid- ered for the shuttle orbiter system because of the constraints imposed by geometrical and mechanical design limitations. As a consequence, variations in power level and/or working fluid selection can be efficiently accommodated by relatively minor modifications to turbine design nozzle. Analytical techniques for optimization of turbine aerodynamic design parameters have been developed. These techniques can be extended to include transient- state simulation and design optimization of the other system components, including the turbine controller, in a manner similar to that used for development of control system for multispool fan-jet engines. Transient-state simulation has demonstrated significant advantages in reducing development cost and risk for a number of systems, and similar advantages can be expected to accrue to the space shuttle auxiliary power system, regardless of the working fluid selected. 1972 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="112">720836-720840 720836. Storable Fueled Power System for Space Shuttle. D. A. Straznickas, J. M. Preble and D. B. Wigmore, Aviation Div., Sundstrand Corp. The effects of system/component selection and design on the fuel consumption of a hydrazine fueled, auxiliary power unit suitable for the Space Shuttle Orbiter are discussed. An auxiliary power unit (APU) output of 150 hp hydraulic and 20 kVs electrical has been assumed as well as a representative load/altitude mission profile. While the efficiency of the various components which make up the system are discussed, emphasis is placed on turbine and control system design as these areas are major contributors to APU performance. 720837. Extending the Life and Recycle Capability of Earth Storable Propellant Systems. Thomas F. Schweickert, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. Rocket propulsion systems for reusable vehicles will be required to operate reliably for a large number of missions with a minimum of maintenance and a fast turnaround. For the space shuttle reaction control system to meet these requirements, current and prior related system failures were examined for their impact on reuse and, where warranted, component design and/or system configura- tion changes were defined for improving system service life. It was found necessary to change the pressurization component arrangement used on many single-use appli- cations in order to eliminate a prevalent check valve failure mode and to incorporate redundant expulsion capability in propellant tank designs to achieve the necessary system reliability. Conceptual designs were developed to show how each of these provisions might be implemented. Material flaws in pressurant and propellant tanks were noted to have a significant effect on tank cycle life; proof testing was defined as the best method of assuring that the tanks were capable of providing the desired cycle life. The appropriate selection of proof- to-working pressure levels is fundamental to the successful application of the tests to cycle life determination. Finally, maintenance considerations dictated a modularized sys- tems approach, allowing the system to be removed from the vehicle for service and repair at a remote site. A unique component packaging concept was studied as a means of facilitating repair and reducing maintenance downtime. 1972 SA E Transactions 720838. Hydraulic and Flight Control System for Space Shuttle Orbiter. William J. O'Brien, McDonnell Aircraft Co. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is a combination spacecraft and aircraft which can remain in orbit from 7 to 30 days and also fly horizontally and land on existing commercial airport runways. The vehicle utilizes gimballing of the main rocket engines for control during ascent and typical aerodynamic surfaces for control during reentry, ap- proach, and landing. A hydraulic system was selected as the power source for operation of these controls and for actuation of the landing gear, brakes, steering, and jet engine deployment. This paper discusses the system selection rationale, power requirements, flight control characteristics, oper- ational profile, maintenance features, built-in test re- quirements and innovative features of the hydraulic system. The system design provides for spacecraft relia- bility with commercial aircraft serviceability. 1972 SA E Transactions 720839. Space Shuttle Bipropellant RCS Engine. W. Sanscrainte and M. Chazen, Bell Aerospace Co. The requirements of the space shuttle bipropellant RCS engine technology contract and the scheduled contract effort are presented. The requirements included an engine concept scalable from 400-1 100 lbf, with a 100 mission life employing N204/MMH propellants. Emphasis is placed on reusability and minimum post-flight servicing. The engine components are reviewed and their selection supported by tradeoff analyses, thrust chamber firing test data, materials test data, and metallurgical evaluations. The materials test data indicate that the proposed silicide coated columbium chamber and uncoated columbium injector have the potential of meeting the mission life consistent with the Isp goals. The engine valve trade studies resulted in the selection of a torque motor operated bipropellant valve configuration. "Fuel vortex film cooling" of the insulated chamber is described, together with the fuel vortex film cooling goal of 295 Isp with a maximum insulated chamber temperature of 2200 F has been demonstrated with that approach to chamber film cooling. Engine thermal analyses are presented. The correlation of predicted and observed pulse mode oper- ation confirms the basic engine transient analytical model. The results of engine rain, sand and dust, salt spray testing, and no post-firing servicing indicate that mini- mum engine ground servicing will be achieved. The test data to date, the component configurations and materials selected indicate that all bipropellant RCS requirements and goals can be met. 1972 SA E Transactions 720840. The Evolution and Development Status of the ALF 502 Turbofan Engine. T. A. Dickey and E. R. Dobak, Avco Corp. The factors influencing the design of the ALF 502 engine are reviewed in context with explanations and some retrospective comments. Early experiments are outlined, followed by a more detailed account of the intense short-term development which culminated in the pre- flight rating test. The conclusion reached is that, in the 6000-8000 lb thrust class, the economy and rapid availability achieved by combining a carefully tailored fan module with a simple, well-proved core engine of modest pressure ratio can outweigh the advantages of higher cycle efficiency obtainable with a more complex machine. 187</page><page sequence="113">720841-720849 188 720841. New Ttirbofan Engines - F101 and TF34. J. E. Worsham, General Electric Co. The General Electric Company has recently been in the process of developing two new turbofan aircraft engines - the TF34 and the F 101. The TF34 has been developed for the U.S. Navy's S-3A antisubmarine warfare aircraft; the F 101 is being developed for the U.S. Air Force B-l strategic bomber. Each of the new aircraft programs has the common requirement for subsonic endurance. The S-3A require- ment includes subsonic operation only while the B-l includes supersonic capability as well as subsonic. This basic mission-mix difference combined with major dif- ferences in engine/air vehicle installation features and different levels of technology applied due to the relative chronology in the respective development programs lead to contrasts in the design features of the major compo- nents of the engines. These major contrasts are presented without delving into the details of the applicable mission analyses and resulting cycle selection. The development of new aircraft engines (in many cases) the concurrent development of unique manufac- turing and nondestructive testing processes and materials. Laser drilling, inertia welding, delta ultrasonic testing, Ti- 17, and René 95 are identified as representative facets of these development programs. 1972 SA E Transactions 720842. F100/F401 Augmented Turbofan Engine - High Thrust-to-Weight Propulsion Systems. John F. McDermott, United Aircraft Corp. The mission requirements laid down in 1968 for advanced Air Force and Navy air superiority fighters dictated a quantum step forward in performance of their propulsion systems, particularly in terms of thrust-to-weight ratio and inlet-engine compatibility. Design features incorporated in the F100/F401 engines to meet the weight requirement include high aerodynamic stage loadings, a high temper- ature turbine with advanced cooling techniques, and a balanced beam exhaust nozzle concept which significantly reduces the weight of this component. Weight has also had a strong influence on selection and development of materials, metallurgical processes, and fabrication tech- niques. Inlet compatibility/stability considerations are addressed by fundamental aerodynamics, together with stability augmentation devices, such as variable camber inlet guide vanes, variable compressor geometry, and a fully modulated augmentor with smooth transition throughout the augmentation range. Description of the physical and performance char- acteristics of the two engines, which utilize a common gas generator, or core, is provided. 1972 SA E Transactions 720843. Propulsion Systems for Orbital Maneuvering Stages. E. A. Lamont and H. G. Diem, Rocket- dyne Div., North American Rockwell Corp. This paper describes propulsion systems under consid- eration for orbital maneuvering stages (Space Tug or Orbit-to-Orbit Shuttle). It describes the Space Tug/Orbit- to-Orbit Shuttle (OOS) configurations, and the missions to be performed by the Space Tug/OOS. The propulsion system requirements for the main engine and the attitude control systems are discribed. The effect of the mission and operational requirements on the main engine system characteristics (that is, start, stop, throttling, reuse, life, etc.) are described. A listing of the propulsion system candidates for this application is provided. Briefly described are existing systems such as Delta, Agena, Centaur, and Transtage. New engine systems (the Staged Combustion Engine and the Aerospike Engine) for this application are described in greater detail. This descrip- tion is followed by a definition of the technology status for both the Staged Combustion Engine and Aerospike Engine, which are the leading candidates for this appli- cation. 1972 SA E Transactions 720846. Prototyping in Army Air Mobility. William E. Crouch, Jr., U.S. Army. This paper reviews the procedures and experience of the Army in applying the prototyping concept to the devel- opment of aircraft capable of satisfying the stringent requirements for man and equipment mobility. The concept has produced the objectives of early determi- nation of design feasibility and production of least-cost airmobiles with a high degree of capability. Present and past programs are reviewed. 720848. Choices for the Future: An Industry Viewpoint on Prototyping. Harold D. Altis, McDonnell Air- craft Co. The role of experimental prototypes in aeronautic ad- vancements is discussed. Two flight regimes are identified for exploration through new prototype projects: sustained supersonic/hypersonic flight and general purpose VTOL aircraft. Specific aircraft design approaches are presented. 720849. Brief on Navy's Sea Control Ship Program. D. V. Cox, U.S. Navy. The primary mission developed for the U.S. Navy's Sea Control Ship Program is protection of underway replen- ishment groups, amphibious groups, convoys, and those task groups which will not have carriers in company. An included mission capability is for some offensive anti- submarine warfare operations such as following up ocean surveillance contacts, sanitizing areas, and forming bar- riers. Several guidelines were used to develop a system to fill this role: no carriers would be available; a high air threat would not exist; the system would be relatively inex- pensive, hence austere, to attain larger numbers; reliance would be on sensors and weapons in the embarked aircraft; and flexibility should permit adjusting the aircraft deckload to the mission and threat and also accommodate changing technology with least effort.</page><page sequence="114">720852-720859 This paper briefly outlines the program, describes the first six months' experience, and presents some of the alternatives for future operation. 1972 SAE Transactions 720852. Suitability of the CL-84 Tiltwing Aircraft for the Sea Control Ship System. T. M. Sullivan, General Dynamics Corp. Effectiveness of the Sea Control Ship (SCS) concept depends on the aircraft it carries. A new class of aircraft, typified by the CL-84, has demonstrated performance that can greatly expand the usefulness of the SCS. Austerity of the system is emphasized to allow for a high number of ships to protect military and civil shipping over a wide area. Catapults and arresting gear are excluded, and launch and recovery of aircraft depend on V/STOL performance. The CL-84 has the ability to take off and land vertically and with a very short deck run can greatly increase payload or fuel load. It also has high-speed, endurance, and altitude capability exceeding that possible with today's rotary wing aircraft. Thus, it has the capacity to extend the ASW and AEW defense perimeter of the SCS system well beyond that otherwise attainable. 720853. Harrier on the Guam - A Blueprint for the 1970s. Lawrence A. Smith, McDonnell Aircraft Co. V/STOL aircraft trials on the Guam have, for the first time, explored the innovative concepts of the Sea Control Ship. An integral part of these trials are the Harrier operations. The Harrier, acquired by the U.S. Marines and operating frequently as an arm of the prototype Sea Control Ship (Guam), has provided the versatile fixed wing aircraft characteristics that are needed to explore this emerging concept. Derivative aircraft, more optimized for these roles, offer the U.S. Navy a high confidence, agile weapon system that will have been conceptually evaluated in the initial trials. Integration of the aircraft with the ship has been easily demonstrated, and the Harrier on the Guam provides a Blueprint for the 1970s. 720854. Combat Capabilities and Versatility Through CCV. D. H. Bennett, McDonnell Aircraft Co.; and R. P. Johannes, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab. Advanced design studies indicate that use of "control configured vehicle" (CCV) concepts can provide im- provements in combat capability and versatility. These benefits will be evidenced by improved performance and survivability, as well as by new maneuvering capabilities not available to pilots of current aircraft. The fly-by-wire (FBW) techniques, utilized to enable CCV, also provide the potential for improved flying qualities. The end result of applying these concepts in the preliminary design stages can be a lighter weight fighter aircraft to do a given job better. 720856. NASA Lift Fan V/STOL Transport Technology Status. Wallace H. Deckert, Ames Research Center, NASA; and Robert C. Evans, Lewis Research Center, NASA. This paper is an overview of the status of lift fan transport technology. Selected results of recently completed NASA in-house and contractual research investigations are included within the general areas of lift fan transport design, propulsion, acoustics, integrated propulsion/air- frame/aircraft control systems; piloted moving-base simulation; and aircraft aerodynamics. Ongoing NASA lift fan transport research is briefly summarized, and a possible next step in the overall program is suggested - the construction of demonstrator large-scale lift fans fabri- cated completely or largely with a flightworthy approach. This would substantiate design weight, performance, rotor stability, noise levels, vectoring, and response; and also enable a first-cut estimation of production and main- tenance costs. 1972 SAE Transactions 720857. Remotely Piloted Vehicle Technology. John D. Seaberg, Jerry R. Etter and Louis R. Records, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab. Recent advances in electronics have enabled the Air Force to consider using remotely piloted vehicles (RPV) for missions now performed by manned aircraft. This paper describes the research and development program for the FDL-23 RPV, an extensively modified Air Force Model 147G drone. The vehicle is being used to initiate studies of techniques and applications of remotely manned aircraft capable of performing various RPV operations. A complete description of the FDL-23 RPV is offered, with special emphasis on the Remote Pilot Station, the Flight Control System, the Command/Telemetry System, and the Video System. A summary of 12 planned flight test missions is also presented. 720858. Flight Simulator Development in Parallel with Aircraft Flight Test - A Case Study of the American Airlines DC-10 Program. F. A. Wirth, American Airlines, Inc. In order to assure delivery of a flight training simulator while flight testing is incomplete and several months ahead of the delivery of its counterpart aircraft, new and unusual methodology must be applied. Such methodology, called positive interface management, has been developed and successfully applied to the DC-10 program by American Airlines. This paper is a case study of this application. 720859. Computer Simulation and Operational Tests of Airtrans Automatic Train Control. D. L. Leftwich, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. A new, automatically controlled transit system is being developed, manufactured, and tested. The system will transport interline, enplaning, and deplaning passengers, employees, interline baggage and mail, airmail, supplies, 189</page><page sequence="115">720860-720866 190 and trash to meet the needs of the world's largest airport. The system, known as Airtrans, will make the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport the easiest airport in the world to use. Computer simulation of the automatic control system to verify control system design and establish limits for operational testing will be discussed. The methodology used to design successful operational tests will be discussed. The material presented will apply to other systems that are similar in concept and design. 720860. Test Requirements in Support of Public Ground Transportation Systems. S. B. Moore, LTV Aerospace Corp. This paper presents considerations in formulating test requirements for public ground transportation programs. Ground transportation systems are categorized by func- tion, speed, subsystem characteristics, etc., in order to aid in establishing requirements of test engineering technol- ogy, test laboratories, and test facilities. Current LTV public transportation programs are used to exemplify the general test requirements of systems proposed to fill the current and projected needs of society. 720861. Fly Off in the Wind Tunnels. Philip P. Antonatos, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab. With the increased emphasis on technical evolution of flight vehicles during preliminary design, the wind tunnels play an important role in establishing the base for extrapolation to full-scale performance. Present-day re- search and development programs are established to improve the correction procedures that are applied to the experimental data and reviews are proceeding to establish the requirements for newer facilities which will better approximate the needed full-scale results. Combining the potentially improved accuracy of obtaining data with the sophisticated computerized design and simulation tech- niques it will then be possible to achieve a fly off in the wind tunnels. 1972 SA E Transactions 720862. Effects of Fuel Corrosion Inhibitors on Filter- Separator Coalescence. Paul C. Linder and Charles R. Martel, Air Force Aero Propulsion Lab. The coalescence performance of fuel filter-water sepa- rators has been determined using JP-5 fuel containing a fuel system icing inhibitor and various fuel corrosion inhibitors. Using distilled water, the corrosion inhibitors degraded coalescence performance to a very slight degree. Using a very hard tap water, the corrosion inhibitors varied greatly in their effect upon coalescence, ranging from slight to severe. Of ten corrosion inhibitors tested with hard tap water, only 3 permitted adequate coales- cence performance. When tested with distilled water, all of the corrosion inhibitors performed satisfactorily. The effect of these fuel additives on the coalescence per- formance of the filter-separator was found to vary greatly, depending upon the type and quality of test water dispersed in the fuel. It is concluded that existing filter-separator test methods are deficient, in that the type and quality of test water is not controlled. 1972 SA E Transactions 720863. Surfactants and Their Effects on Filter/ Sepa- rators. T. H. Jefferson and S. B. Boulware, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and De- velopment Center. Surfactants (surface active agents) in certain concentra- tions and combinations are known to have a harmful effect on filter/separators. They affect the basic physio- chemical parameters associated with coalescence and the removal of solid particulate from hydrocarbon fuels. Tests conducted on military filter/separators indicate that JP-4 and JP-5 jet fuel can be decontaminated properly; however, problems exist in the decontamination of water from motor gasoline (MoGas) and No. 2 diesel fuel. Tests conducted to determine the effect of surfactants versus electrostatic charge generation indicate that small amounts of surfactants or combinations of surfactants and free water or solid particulates can convert a nearly inert fuel into a fuel producing high and dangerous levels of static electricity. 1972 SA E Transactions 720864.' Charge Removal by Irradiation. A. Neal de Gaston, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Jet fuel maintains a static electric charge due to its low conductivity (&lt; IO12 mhos/m). The de Gaston Décharger is an invention which uses ionizing radiation to increase fuel conductivity (&gt;109 mhos/m) temporarily. The Décharger is able to reduce charge density below any arbitrary level for any flow rates and charge densities by suitable design. The basic theory of the Décharger is discussed. Its design and the summarized test date are given. The data indicate that the fuel conductivity is increased to 7.6 x 10*9 mhos/m. The average energy per effective ion produced is &lt;147 eV. 1972 SA E Transactions 720866. The Electrostatic Charging Tendencies of Jet Fuel Filtration Equipment. K. H. Strauss, Texaco, Inc., W. G. Dukek, Esso Research &amp; Engineering Co.; and R. E. Langston, Buckeye Pipe Line Co. As part of an effort to develop technical information on the electrical charging characteristics of aircraft fuels and ground filtration equipment, the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) conducted an extensive study using the filtration equipment of the pipeline supplying J. F. Kennedy Airport, New York. Relative charging tenden- cies of 10 different types and makes of coalescer and separator elements were obtained on the jet fuels being pumped to the airport. Fuel effects were eliminated as far as possible by simultaneously monitoring a "test" filter- separator and a "control" filter-separator, mounted in</page><page sequence="116">720867-720873 parallel. Over a 3-1/2 month period, 199 fuel batches totaling 154.2 million gallons were filtered and monitored. The results showed fuel characteristics to have the major effect on filter charging characteristics, as batch-to-batch variations were greater than differences between filters on an absolute basis. However, simultaneous side-by-side tests showed teflon-coated screen type separators to charge less than pleated paper separators. No relation- ships were found between charging rates and fuel properties, such as rest conductivity and fuel cleanliness. 1972 SAE Transactions 720867. Cost Your Brakes Down. R. L. Rosback, The Bendix Corp. Aircraft wheels and brakes are significant maintenance cost items on transport airplanes. Cost can be minimized by adequate design criteria for original equipment and modernization of existing equipment through the incor- poration of new technology. The four parties key to the minimization of operational costs of wheels and brakes are the Federal Aviation Admin. (FAA), the airframe manufacturer, the supplier, and the user. This paper deals with how each of these parties can contribute to this effort. 720868. Antiskid and Modern Aircraft. E. A. Hirzel, Hydro-Aire Div., Crane Co. The essence of braking control is to adjust the brake pressure properly at all times to maintain brake torque at the correct level to balance the tire-runway friction force at its peak value, and thus give the aircraft maximum available deceleration. Hydro-Aire has been involved in the development of skid control systems from the days of the old "tire savers" to today's fully automatic braking controls. This paper presents the technical history and evolution of the modern brake control or "antiskid" system. 720869. Tire Development by Dedicated Involvement. Harold Saviers, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper discusses some of the improvements made in aircraft tires and looks at possible future developments. Fiber is discussed; current nylon fiber may well be replaced with fiber B, a new organic material with high strength and high modulus. Compounds can be tested on accurate machines. Tread designs are changing to a centerline rib with four grooves. A new carcass shape in the lower sidewall areas is discussed. Retreading practices are reviewed, and it is shown that the unit price of new tires and retreaded tires has increased very little in relation to performance. 720870. Cantilever Aircraft Tires - More Than a Break for Brakes. W. R. Woodall, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Aircraft users can expect a more efficient use of the tire envelope if their fleet is equipped with the new cantilever tires. This thoroughly tested concept provides for larger brakes, longer wear, better high-speed performance, and improved body durability. This paper details the design philosophy and transitional processes by way of which this tire came to be available for aircraft service. 1972 SAE Transactions 720871. Non-Steady-State Thermal Analysis of a Rolling Aircraft Tire. N. M. Trivisonno, The B. F. Goodrich Co. Our previously reported steady-state thermal analysis for a rolling passenger tire has been modified. This makes possible a nonsteady-state thermal analysis for tires which operate under nonsteady-state conditions. A finite ele- ment analysis was used which involved the solution of a set of simultaneous heat balance equations. Conduction with the tire, conduction to the road surface, convection to the contained air and , to the surrounding air, and radiation from the outside and inside surfaces of the tire were taken into account. The experimentally measured infrared surface temperature distribution was used as input data. A new, fast-response infrared camera and infrared recorder were used to obtain the data. The results gave, as a function of time, the complete temperature distribution and rates of heat generation in the tire. 1972 SAE Transactions 720872. Optimization of Commercial Transport Airplane Stopping Systems. D. B. Meredith and B. C. Hainline, The Boeing Co. The role of the aircraft manufacturer in the design, integration, and optimization of commercial transport airplane stopping systems is discussed. Specific emphasis is placed on: system design considerations, configurations, and features; laboratory and flight testing; typical problems encountered; and future basic data require- ments. Advancements in stopping system simulation techniques and antiskid control systems in recent years have allowed large improvements in stopping system efficiency. Future improvements are dependent on ob- taining basic data on tire and brake dynamic character- istics for use in simulation studies to control and improve the combined brake and tire frequency response phase lag. It is anticipated that new rational landing rules being developed by the FAA must account for and include the effect of the engine thrust reversing system on stopping distances. The design, development, certification, and operation of airplanes with integrated air brake, wheel brake, and thrust reversing systems will further emphasize optimization of the total airplane stopping system. 720873. Forming the Space-Age Giant Components. D. E. Krantz, Convair Aerospace Div., General Dy- namics Corp. A program was conducted to develop stretch-formed corrugated panels made of Rene 41 for the skin of hot areas in the booster nose section of the space shuttle. The temperatures reach 1600 F there, and this superalloy was necessary. The material is difficult to form, however, and 191</page><page sequence="117">720874-720904 192 techniques had to be developed for tooling and formation of the panels. This paper discusses those techniques, as well as those used to age-form thick aluminum panels for cryogenic fuel tanks. In addition, explosive-forming and bulge-forming at Convair is described. 720874. High-Frequency, Pulsed-Current GTA Welding. William A. Roden, Convair Aerospace Div., General Dynamics Corp. Investigations were made of the effects of high-frequency, d-c, straight polarity current pulsations in the range of 2,000-25,000 pulses/s on the quality and mechanical properties of gas tungsten arc (GTA) welds in 2219 aluminum. Pulsed-current and conventional GTA welds were made on 0.125, 0.250, and 0.350 in 2219 aluminum, using free fall, single-pass butt welds. Results of this inves- tigation show that pulsed-current welds are superior in x-ray integrity to conventional GTA welds made under similar conditions, with discontinuity levels 80% lower for relatively long weldments. High-frequency pulsation is also very effective in avoiding the typical cast structure of weld metal. Such welds exhibit fracture toughness values 10-15% higher than conventional GTA weldments. Potential manufacturing advantages include higher weld quality (fewer rejects and lower rework costs) and thinner weld lands, which result in lower structural weights. 720877. A Digital Instrumentation System for Engine Testing. C. W. Formwalt and J. L. Frank, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. This paper discusses the Dynamometer System of Accu- rate, Unambiguous Readouts (Dinosaur), a new system used in the performance testing of engines at John Deere. Readouts are digital, and data are in engineering units; thus, the engineer supervising the test can make decisions regarding the conduct of the test while there is still time to modify the test program. Testing time is reduced as the operator need not perform calculations, data conversions, etc. Test setup and teardown time is minimized by checking all instrumentation transducers for proper operation prior to the test at which time a bulkhead system with quick-disconnect connectors is utilized. Among the subjects discussed are the operation and design of Dinosaur, the method of digital computation, and the use of a new programmable-cascadable frequency divider. 720878. The Engineer and Product Liability. Leo C. Peters, Iowa State University. One result of the recent increase in product liability litigation has been the involvement of engineers in the legal environment. This involvement has been developed through changing theories of liability and increasing sophistication of engineered products. This paper illustrates typical involvement of an engineer in products liability litigation and emphasizes the differences between practicing engineering in a technical environment and in a nontechnical, legal environment. A brief historical discussion of the breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and strict liability theories of products liability is also presented. 720901. 4x4 Highway Tractor Concepts. James Mueller, Axle Div., Eaton Corp. Two new 4x4 drivetrain systems have been developed for highway tractors that are used to pull multiple trailer combinations. The first one is a 4 x 2 that automatically becomes a 4 x 4 when conditions exist that require 4x4 operation. The second one is a full-time 4x4 that proportions the drive torque 36% to the front axle and 64% to the rear axle. A unique front driving steering axle has also been developed that permits a 4 x 4 system to be installed in a standard 4x2 truck. There is no need to relocate any major components to make space available for a front driving steering axle. 720902. Urban Noise Legislation. Cosimo Caccavari, Dept. of Environmental Control, City of Chicago. The types of noise problems confronting the urban dweller and the legislation dealing with such noises are discussed in this paper. Of prime consideration are vehicular transportation, mass transportation, and rail- road noise. Current noise regulations in Chicago are reviewed and the needs of future legislation explored. 720903. Restrictive Differentials. Stanley E. Chocholek and Russell C. Ferbitz, Rockwell-Standard Div., North American Rockwell Corp. Various methods have been used to restrict differential action in drive axles to prevent loss of traction. Although these methods differ in principle, they exhibit similar characteristics. Based on tractive effort performance, most devices can be categorized into one of four basic classifications. This paper defines these classes and compares them to requirements needed for the "ideal" differential. 720904. NoSPIN and Tandem-Lock Differentials - Op- eration and Application. A. A. Choma, Detroit Automotive Products Corp. The operation and application os the NoSPIN and Tandem-Lock differentials to power transmissions is described. The three types of NoSPIN - standard, silent, and silent overrunning - and two of Tandem-Lock - conven- tional NoSPIN and inside-out design - are described, and the positive and negative features of each are considered. The paper points out the early design deficiencies and the corrective action taken to overcome them. The application guidelines of the NoSPIN and Tandem-Lock differentials are also covered so that proper application of the differentials can be carried out.</page><page sequence="118">720905-720914 720905. A Shiftable Controlled Traction Differential for Heavy Duty Trucks. William W. Hoenes, Axle Div., Eaton Corp. This paper describes a shiftable controlled traction differential developed for both on and off highway heavy-duty truck application. The differential can provide greater limited slip action when engaged for adverse driving conditions than current designs and yet not have the undesirable aspects normally associated with limited slip differentials. There is also a unique lubrication system that extends the life of the unit. 720906. Mack Power Divider. Robert W. Stieg, Mack Trucks, Inc. This paper discusses the history, theory, operation, and refinements of one of the oldest limited-slip vehicle axle and tandem interaxle differentials that has remained in continuous production. The design uses a cam and wedge principle, but is a true differential in the manner of a conventional geared unit. Its unique drive principle provides frictional bias in a ratio between 2-3:1 to increase vehicle drawbar pull on split-coefficient surfaces. 720908. Oshkosh Powermatic Transmissions for On/Off- Highway Vehicles. Wallace K. Blank, Oshkosh Truck Corp. The approach taken in the design, development, and application of an Oshkosh powershift transmission for on/off-highway truck use is described. The Oshkosh transmission design has a building block concept, and in its basic form consists of a two-speed splitter auxiliary attached to the four-speed main drop box to provide a transmission with eight forward speeds and two reverse speeds. The two-speed splitter auxiliary may be omitted to provide a transmission with four forward speeds and a single reverse speed. The eight-speed transmission will be capable of use with high speed, low torque engines, or with low speed, high torque engines. This is accomplished by changing the input ratio gears. The overall ratio of the transmissions may also be changed to match tire size and/or axle ratios. The ratio change for engine speed-torque and/or overall ratio may be made without affecting the transmission range or physical configurations. 720910. A Study of Drivetrain Cost Comparisons Using Data Bank Information. Clifford L. Hayden, Mainstem, Inc. A different approach to the study of drivetrain cost comparisons is presented, using 175 units operating within two fleets. Engine, transmission, clutch, driveshaft, uni- versal joint, etc., were identical, item for item; the exceptions being identical brake types but different manufacture and differences in the manufacture of chassis. All units were serviced by the same mechanics. Use of a data bank by the mechanics gave a true cost/mile for the two fleets compared, and showed that good record keeping would provide fleet managers continued benefits. 720911. Drivetrain Problems - Do They Exist? J. E. Paquette, Fleet Facts, Inc. An initial report presenting order of magnitude data only. Owning, operating, and maintaining fleets of line-haul and pickup and delivery units has its own peculiar problems. This paper considers questions such as what manufacture of vehicle should be selected, reliability of the product, whether or not to perform maintenance, etc. Specifically covered is the possible problem area of drive trains; a preliminary standard operating system developed by the American Trucking Assn., Inc. is given. 720912. Dual-Use Fluids for Power Steering and Power Brakes. Bruce C. Brenner, Dow Corning Corp. Increasing underhood temperatures and decreasing avail- ability of vacuum, indirectly caused by more stringent safety and emission control regulations, brings the possibility of central hydraulic systems closer. However, as the central system fully evolves, equipment manufac- turers indicate that they expect a transition step, where the same fluid will be used in both the power steering and power braking systems. With the expected demands on fluids to be used in such systems increasing, Dow Corning has initiated the development of a silicone candidate, based on the most readily available silicone fluid, dimethylpolysiloxane. The recent advances in lubrication technology, information on compatibility with presently used materials, and the inherent physical and chemical properties which allow a silicone fluid to be a serious candidate for such usage, are presented. 720913. Single Power Source for Both Power Steering and Power Boosted Brakes. D. E. Runkle and U. Grinbergs, The Bendix Corp. Improved power brake booster designs and systems with redundant capabilities are anticipated to be required as a result of the new safety regulations for improved stopping distances, and indirectly, as the result of the new emission controls because of the potential loss of vacuum aviability and increased underhood temperatures. In early 1968 it was becoming obvious to certain brake engineering groups that a new brake booster system with reserve capabilities for truck hydraulic brakes would be a requirement in the near future. Bendix, as a major independent supplier of power brake boosters, had more than a casual interest in the trend appearing over the horizon. As the result of discussions with customers and our internal analysis of various power booster systems, hydraulics, in the form of the Bendix Hydro-Boost system with an integral electric motor pump backup, was settled upon as one major approach to best serve the industry. This paper is devoted primarily to the design and operating characteristics of the Bendix Hydro-Boost Power Brake Booster Unit for trucks. 720914. Hydra-Flex Seat: A New Kind of Ride for Truck Drivers. John Carter, Seats, Inc. A review of the long-standing highway truck ride problem 193</page><page sequence="119">720915-720924 194 and conventional solutions emphasizes an increased usage of suspension seats to isolate the driver from predominant cab vibration. A novel new suspension seat (Hydra-Flex) features an articulated linkage which conforms to similar kinematics as natural motion of the human body. Further, this linkage inherently provides an action which cancels the characteristic back-slapping motion of truck cabs. Numerous inherent advantages over conventional designs of suspension seats are disclosed, and these features are attributed to the "bionics" principle which is involved. 720915. Airdraulic Seat System. Arthur Harder, Coach &amp; Car Equipment Co. A new and different seat suspension suitable and advan- tageous for off-the-road and highway vehicles is pre- sented. Contributing to a comfortable ride for the operator are several proven features, to which have been added three new and unique features. The seat suspension is an air-oil cushioning system to which has been added a servo-linkage to operate a two port hydraulic valve; the servo-linkage being tied to the vertical seat motion. The new, unique features are: 1. Unlimited range of adjustment of seat vertical position to suit the individual operator, assuring him of easy access to the brake pedal, good vision, and comfort, regardless of his particular body dimensions. 2. At any vertical seat position the operator chooses, automatic adjustment for the weight of the operator. 3. Clearance between the front edge of the seat cushion and the rim of the steering wheel, once set to the operator's liking, is maintained, including the time while the operator is dismounting and remounting. On other air cushion seat suspensions with motion restrained to vertical up and down as this one is, no such maintenance of clearance occurs, and dismounting as well as remounting is difficult as a result. 720916. Power/Weight Ratio for Tractor Trailers. David L. Paul, Associated Truck Lines, Inc. The use of a computer-generated vehicle mission simu- lator has made it possible for truck operators and manufacturers to select a horsepower-to-weight ratio to fulfill the requirements for operation over a known terrain. This practical presentation shows several specific applications of the procedure and offers some conclusions drawn from those applications. 720918. What's Happened to Secondary Wiring Life? C. N. Hostert, United Air Lines. The deterioration of secondary ignition wiring life on today's internal combustion gasoline engine has created many maintenance problems in the field. The mandatory use of TVRS (resistance wire) has amplified these problems and made them more difficult to solve. The solution does not lie solely with wire design - engine application, engine design, and component selection and location are also important factors. 720922. Simulation of Tractor-Semitrailer Handling. A. I. Krauter and R. K. Wilson, Cornell University. A computer model of a tractor-semitrailer is developed which extends that given by Mikulcik in SAE 710045 (Ref. 10 of paper). The extended model allows translation, yaw, roll, and pitch of both tractor and semitrailer. Lateral and fore-and-aft weight transfer is displayed. Wheel dynamics are included and effects of wheel slip, slip angle, vehicle speed, and tire load are used in the calculation of the tire forces. The vehicle is maneuvered by a simulated driver who specifies the front-wheel steer angle and the brake torques. The ability of the model to accurately describe a real vehicle is studied by using the model to simulate a full-scale experimental test. The model is also used to study two types of proportional braking for a tractor- semitrailer executing a large-radius turn on a wet asphalt track. 1972 SAE Transactions 720923. (SP-373) Establishing a Testing Standard for Truck Tire Sounds. S. A. Lippmann, Uniroyal Tire Co. As highway development programs brought increased truck traffic through formerly isolated communities, public sensitivity to truck tire noise increased significantly. Industry was alert to the possible consequences of social and legal pressures and acted in concert to set up standards for noise control and for establishing criteria by which to measure annoyance levels. Work by several leading associations provided a starting point for inves- tigations by the SAE Truck Tire Noise Subcommittee. The Subcommittee's efforts resulted in formulation of a tire testing procedure and a consolidation of requirements to be incorporated into a proposed standard. This paper reviews the objectives and approaches of the subcom- mittee and serves as an introduction to the accompanying papers. 720924. (SP-373) Mechanisms of Tire Sound Generation. T. R. Wik, B. F. Goodrich Tire Co., R. F. Miller, B. F. Goodrich Tire Co. A conceptual framework has been developed for inves- tigating the generation of sound by tires. Recent meas- urements have quantified some of the characteristics of truck tire sounds. The characteristics that have been measured include the peak A-weighted sound level and its dependence on the tread pattern, speed, and deflection of the tire; the effect of the road surface on tire sound levels; and the spectral distribution of tire sounds. These characteristics are discussed in terms of the mechanisms of tire sound generation. 1972 SAE Transactions</page><page sequence="120">720925-720931 720925. (SP-373) Effects of Operating Parameters on Truck Tire Sounds. David A. Corcoran, The General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The A-weighted sound-level measurements of truck tire sounds are dependent on a number of variables. These parameters, in general, include vehicle speed, load, inflation pressure, tread wear, test surface, tread pattern, distance from the microphone to sound source, time, number of tires used on the vehicle, tire size and type, etc. These parameters are individually considered and their effects on the A-weighted sound level measurements of truck tire sounds are discussed in this paper. 1972 SAE Transactions 720926. (SP-373) Characteristics of Truck Tire Sound. G. R. Thurman, The Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. The nature of the sound produced by running truck tires is primarily due to the tread pattern design. At 50 mph the sound consists of a fundamental in the frequency range 300-400 Hz and of several higher harmonics. Each of these harmonics, including the fundamental, may consist of several separate frequencies; however, the spread of these frequencies is less than one-third octave. The singing, presistent sound produced by certain tire designs is shown to be associated with the level of the higher harmonics, particularly the third and forth. 720927. (SP-373) Sound Levels of Highway Truck Tires, Proposed SAE Recommended Practice XJ57. Gerald M. Dougherty, Member, SAE Truck Tire Noise Subcommittee. The noise standard is acceptable only if it isolates the area of concern (tire sounds), correlates to human response, and is repeatable, easily understood, and economically feasible. With these goals attained, the SAE Subcommittee on Truck Tire Noise proposes their recommendations on "Sound Level of Highway Truck Tires - Recommended Practice XJ57." Part I of this paper contains the final draft of the test procedure that the Subcommittee has proposed to SAE committees as a recommendation. Part II explains and supports the Subcommittee's decisions for the recom- mended specification. 1972 SAE Transactions 720928. (SP-373) An Experiment for Relating Objective and Subjective Assessments of Truck Tire Noise. Ralph K. Hillquist, General Motors Proving Ground. The SAE Truck Tire Noise Subcommittee, as a part of its efforts toward writing a measurement and evaluation procedure, conducted an experimental test program for relating objective and subjective assessments of truck tire noise. The program comprised a series of designed experiments involving 6 trucks, 18 sets of tires, and 5 vehicle operating modes. The test runs were presented in random fashion to a 'jury situated alongside a highway. The subjective noisiness ratings and the A-weighted sound levels obtained verified the design objectives of the experiment and, further, correlated well with each other. 1972 SAE Transactions 720929. (SP-373) Jury Reactions to Truck Tire Noise - An SAE Study. S. A. Lippmann, Uniroyal Tire Co. The A-weighted sound level accounts for the bulk (but not all) of the jury's reaction to the sound of trucks coasting on a variety of tires. A component of the jury's reaction is related by the study to the manner in which the sound decays after the vehicle passes the point of observation. This component also appears to depend strongly on the characteristics of the sound. The jury's reaction shows two forms of distortion: end-of-scale compression and temporal drift. The analysis attempts to account for these factors and to see beyond them into the jury's basis for reacting. 1972 SAE Transactions 720930. A Comparative Study by Vehicle Testing of Copper Alloy and Gray Iron Brake Discs. S. K. Rhee, Bendix Corp.; and J. E. Byers, Bendix Automotive Control Systems Group. Automotive friction materials are composites containing three kinds of components: an organic binder, fiber for reinforcement, and property modifiers. At low braking temperatures, the wear rate of the friction materials is controlled primarily by abrasive and adhesive mecha- nisms. At higher braking temperatures, the wear rate increases exponentially with increasing temperature due to thermal degradation of the binder and other components, and the exponential wear rate is frequently accompanied by brake fade. Thus, one method of reducing thermal wear and fade tendency is to lower the temperature at the rotor/friction material interface. Since the rate of heat transfer from the interface is mostly dependent upon the conductive and convective modes, a rotor of low con- ductivity will have a significant advantage over a rotor of low conductivity if the heat capacity remains the same. Therefore, brake discs made of chromium copper (99 Cu-1 Cr) were evaluated and compared with gray cast iron discs. The thermal conductivity of chromium copper is six times greater than that of gray cast iron. The evaluation methods were dynamometer and vehicle (24,500 lb gvw) tests. In all cases, the copper alloy brakes were found to run substantially cooler than gray cast iron brakes. The copper alloy brakes were more effective in terms of torque or deceleration at high temperatures, and showed sub- stantially lower wear of the friction material as well as of the disc when compared with gray cast iron brakes. The copper alloy discs used did not have any coatings on the surface. 1972 SAE Transactions 720931. An Investigation of Passenger Car Refueling Losses. Malcolm Smith, Scott Research Labs., Inc. 195</page><page sequence="121">720932-720937 196 This paper presents the findings of the second year of a planned three-year program to investigate the hydro- carbon losses sustained during the refueling of passenger cars. The magnitude and frequency of occurrence of spills by type of spill were estimated from observations of refueling operations during a five-city, four-season field survey. The magnitude of the average observed loss due to spills was 10.6 g and the probability of a spill loss was 0.329. The average spill loss was 3.5 g per refueling operation or 0.3 g/gal of dispensed gasoline. Measure- ments of displaced hydrocarbon losses were made under controlled conditions during a laboratory study conducted in the Scott all-weather room. A regression analysis of these data yielded a model which estimates the displaced hydrocarbon loss as a function of dispensed fuel temper- ature, displaced vapor temperature, and the Reid vapor pressure of the fuel. A sample of 732 measurements of dispensed fuel and displaced vapor temperature, taken during daylight hours only, yielded a preliminary estimate of 5 g/gal of dispensed gasoline for the average displaced loss. 1972 SA E Transactions 720932. The Effect of Gasoline Volatility on Exhaust Emissions. P. J. Clarke, Esso Research and Engineering Co. For many years, the primary consideration for deter- mining motor gasoline volatility specifications has been good car performance, that is, fast start-ups, freedom from vapor lock, and good driveability. Now, for late-model cars, there is a new consideration for volatility control. This is exhaust emissions. Fuel volatility has been found to have a significant effect on the exhaust emissions of many late-model vehicles. A decrease of 5 psi Rvp from current levels increased exhaust CO an average of 28% at 70 F and 22% at 30 F in a group of 11 cars. Exhaust hydrocarbons were increased an average of about 5% at both temperatures. Now, before lowering fuel volatility, it is important to consider the effect the change will have on exhaust emissions as well as car performance. 720933. Driveability Testing on A Chassis Dynamometer. R. J. Wahrenbrock, Ethyl Corp.; and J. B. Duckworth, American Oil Co. Driveability tests were conducted on 12 cars at four ambient temperatures with seven fuels of differing front-end and mid-boiling range volatility levels. One fuel was a typical winter-grade gasoline, one was typical of summer grade, and the remaining five were blended to provide various combinations of Reid vapor pressure and ASTM 50% evaporation temperature. Three driving schedules were used on the chassis dynamometer - a cold-start driveaway schedule to study operation from cold start through warmup, a warm-vehicle procedure to evaluate driveability with a thoroughly warmed-up car, and a hot-start vapor lock procedure to observe hot-fuel handling characteristics. Road tests were run at one temperature on four cars with two fuels for correlation between road and dyna- mometer results. For additional correlation between road and dynamometer, the dynamometer results at one temperature were compared to the results of road driveability tests conducted by CRC at Pasco, Wash, in 1969, which used four of the same fuels. The results of this program showed that the drive- ability characteristics of automobiles and their sensitivity to changes in physical properties of fuels can be evaluated on a chassis dynamometer. In general, the chassis dynamometer is more discriminating or more severe than comparable road tests. Correlations are developed show- ing the response in terms of driveability to changes in fuel properties. 1972 SA E Transactions 720934. New Emphasis on Fuel Volatility - Effects on Vehicle Warm-up with Quick-Release Chokes. Russell F. Stebar and Robert L. Everett, Re- search Labs., General Motors Corp. Quick-release chokes may become an essential feature of advanced exhaust emission control systems to minimize emissions during warmup. However, quick-release chokes greatly impair warmup drivability when gasolines of conventional volatility are used. Consequently, modifi- cations of gasoline volatility were investigated as one approach to restoring warmup drivability with quick- release chokes. Warmup drivability of two test cars equipped with quick-release chokes was measured on a chassis dyna- mometer at 40 and 68 F using fuels with widely different volatility characteristics. Warmup drivability was essen- tially restored by increasing fuel volatility in the 40-90% ASTM distillation range. Front-end volatility up to the 40% point had very little effect. 1972 SA E Transactions 720935. Quick-Heat Intake Manifolds for Reducing Cold Engine Emissions. William D. Bond, Engineer- ing Staff, General Motors Corp. This report presents some design parameters and devel- opment experience on quick-heat intake manifolds for evaporating the fuel. These can achieve good fuel evaporation soon after a cold start. Used in conjunction with a fast-opening choke, such a quick-heat intake manifold helps reduce carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. This is especially effective on cars with catalytic con- verters, since CO caused by cold enrichment is produced at a time when the catalyst is not yet hot and effective. The sensitivity of one design of quick-heat intake manifold to fuel volatility characteristics is included. A variety of ways to correlate drivability with the ASTM distillation characteristics of the fuel are evaluated. 720937. Idle Emissions Testing. J. Panzer, Esso Research and Engineering Co. Data were obtained on exhaust emissions at idle from four fleets of cars to develop information that would be needed</page><page sequence="122">720938-720941 for servicing vehicles rejected by state and city emission surveillance programs. As expected, emissions increased with car age. Pre- 1968 European cars produced higher emissions and responded less favorably to tune-up than other pre- 1968 cars. Idle emission standards already proposed can bring about rejection rates of 10-60% of all cars depending on the emission standard and local car population. Extended idling can increase these rejection rates by 3-31% of all cars. Although most rejected cars passed emission standards after tune-up, a significant percentage required additional repair work in order to pass. It is clear that several standards, some cars could not be made to pass at a reasonable cost. Evaluation of exhaust analyzers has led to devel- opment of criteria for service station equipment. Ana- lyzers have been manufactured that could meet these criteria. 720938. Effectiveness and Costs of Retrofit Emission Control Systems for Used Motor Vehicles. Jose L. Bascunana, Environmental Protection Agen- cy; and Milton J. Webb, Olson Labs., Inc. A program was undertaken to determine which retrofit methods are currently feasible for used cars, considering emission reduction effectiveness, cost, effects on vehicle performance, facilities, and labor skill required for retrofit installation, maintenance, and inspection. An extensive search was made for all sources of information on retrofit methods, developers, and pro- ducers. Eleven representative retrofit devices were acutally tested in this project. A fleet of 20 used vehicles without factory installed exhaust control systems was used for testing the performance of the retrofit devices. The vehicles were tested first without a retrofit device to obtain a reference baseline, and then with retrofit device installed. Emission tests were conducted by the 1972 CVS Federal Test Procedure. Fuel consumption was also measured during the CVS test. Drivability tests were conducted by an Automobile Manufacturers Association procedure. Durability tests were conducted on four types of retrofit devices over a representative driving pattern for 25,000 miles. To evaluate and compare the different retrofit sys- tems, an objective evaluation methodology was developed to provide quantitative figures of merit or indexes in terms of feasibility criteria, performance, and cost-effectiveness. A summary of the results of the retrofit tests, analyses, and evaluations are presented. 720939. More on Origins of Exhaust Hydrocarbons - Effects of Zero Oil Consumption, Deposit Loca- tion and Surface Roughness. J. T. Wentworth, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Three investigations are reported which clarify the mechanism of exhaust hydrocarbon (HC) emission and suggest new ways to reduce these emissions from recip- rocating, 4-stroke, spark-ignition engines. The work was carried out on an engine using the sealed ring-orifice (SR-O) piston, which effectively eliminates exhaust HC emission caused by the piston-bore-ring crevice. This reduces HC emission substantially, making other effects more apparent. In the first investigation, exhaust HC concentrations were unchanged when the engine was run first with oil and then water in the crankcase. This means that oil did not contribute to exhaust HC emission in the SR-O engine. In the second investigation, small patches of simulated deposit attached at different locations in the combustion chamber caused exhaust HC concentration increases which varied by a factor of 10, depending on deposit location. In the last experiment, exhaust HC concentration dropped 17.1 ppm C when the rough cast surface of the combustion chamber was smoothed from about 540 /xin to about 16 /xin, rms. 1972 SAE Transactions 720940. Field Emission Performance of 1971 Generai Motors Cars in Customer Service. Daniel L. Frank, General Motors Corp. This paper describes the exhaust emission performance of 127 General Motors automobiles during their first year of operation. All were 1971 models in private service. The evaluation covered the period from November 1970 to November 1971. Each car selected for the program had received an exhaust emission test before leaving its respective assem- bly plant. At approximately three-month intervals each car was again evaluated for emissions. It was checked for drivability and for conformance to certain emission- related specifications. Emission-related parameters were maintained at the manufacturer's specification. The diagnosis and maintenance performed kept the emission levels near their "end-of-line" averages through- out the length of the program. The causes of the emission failures were determined to define design requirements of future emission systems. Discussion: C. E.

Deposits that accumulate in the critical areas of carbu- retors can adversely affect the design metering charac- teristics. Since this can cause an increase in vehicle exhaust emissions, it is important that these deposits be minimized. Fuel additives provide an effective means of cleaning carburetors and keeping them clean. Thirteen commercial and experimental additives of different chemical composition were screened in laboratory engine tests, and four of these were selected for further evaluation in vehicles operated in consumer type service. The detergency action of the additives resulted in 197</page><page sequence="123">720942-720946 198 reduced carburetor deposits, reduced exhaust emissions, and improved fuel economy. In most cases, there was an additive concentration effect, in which effectiveness increased with increased concentration. The laboratory engine tests were useful to evaluate the carburetor detergency characteristics of the additives prior to initiating more extensive field service tests on the most promising ones. A directional correlation was obtained between the laboratory engine tests and the vehicle tests in consumer type service. 720942. Simulated Road Test Evaluation of the Effect of Gasoline Additives on Exhaust Gas Emissions. T. M. Franklin, R. L. Stambaugh and R. R. Kuhn, Rohm &amp; Haas Co. A laboratory engine test procedure has been developed which measures the effect of gasoline additives on engine deposits and the resultant effect of these deposits on exhaust gas emissions. The basis for the laboratory test is the Department of Health, Education and Welfare 50,000 mile durability driving schedule. Several gasoline additives have been evaluated with varying effects on exhaust gas emissions. A strong dependence on base fuel composition was also noted. 720943. Automobile Club of Southern California Progress in Vehicle Exhaust Emission Control. Louis J. Bintz and Thomas A. Tappenden, Automobile Club of Southern California. A study of 93 new 1972 vehicles of various makes and models was made to determine what effect the more stringent California emission standards have had on exhaust emission levels (especially oxides of nitrogen), fuel economy, and engine design. Data are compared with similar fleets of 1970 and 1971 model vehicles and show an encouraging reduction in exhaust emission levels, with a penalty in fuel economy. 720944. Effect of Unleaded Fuel and Exhaust Gas Recir- culation on Sludge and Varnish Formation. R. L. Stambaugh, R. J. Kopko and T. M. Franklin, Rohm and Haas Co. Based on evaluations of sludge and varnish performance in a modified Sequence V-C procedure, it would appear that reduced lead levels in gasoline and the use of EGR hardware will place at least as great a demand on lubricants as is the case today. Analysis of sludge from representative tests indicated that the total amount of sludge formed from unleaded fuel was essentially the same as when leaded fuel was used. Hence, it does not seem likely that engine oil drain intervals of the future can be lengthened. 1972 SA E Transactions 720945. Influence of Lubricating Oil Ash on the ORI of Engines Running on Unleaded Fuel. A Marciante and P. Chiampo, Fiat, S.p.A. The paper gives a survey on the influence of lubricant ashes on octane requirement increase (ORI) at steady- state high speed of a typical engine: the 125 B model, modified to run on unleaded 91 NORM fuel. Through preliminary tests, a method was set up to evaluate knock by oscilloscope, and a test cycle of 216 h was run which permits reproduction of the stabilization of deposits equivalent to 40,000 km (25,000 miles) of operation. With this type of test, straight mineral oils, ashless oils, and oils containing traditional organometallic, calcium/zinc, barium/zinc, and magnesium/zinc base additives as well as calcium, sodium, and zinc base additives of new formulation were evaluated. The results revealed that ORI values are almost identical, that is, 3-4 octane numbers for both the straight mineral and ashless oils. As regards the oils with organometallic additives, ORI is influenced by the nature of the metal, and its values are in the range of 8-5 octane numbers. Also, the relation between ash content and ORI value was evaluated for the calcium/zinc and barium/zinc oils; it appears that ORI decreases only when the ash content is less than 0.3%. The results obtained with primary reference fuels (PRF) were confirmed with two full boiling range fuels (FBRF). 720946. Shear Stability of Multigrade Crankcase Oils in Cars, Laboratory Engines, and Bench Tests. M. F. Smith, Jr., Paramins Labs., R. M. Stewart, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co.; and H. R. Stringer, Rohm &amp; Haas Co. Extensive field test data have been obtained which can serve as a basis for evaluating the ability of various laboratory methods to predict the shear stability of multigrade crankcase oils. This basis was developed by determining the average viscosity changes of one single grade and 12 multigrade reference oils in six separate car fleets. The 12 multigrade oils were formulated with all of the chemical types of V.l. improvers currently in use, or likely to be used, in the near future. As a second part of the program, four types of bench tests and three different laboratory engine tests were evaluated for their ability to predict the average viscosity changes of the 13 reference oils observed in the fleet tests. Correlation of the laboratory method results with the field data was marred by the nonconformance of two multi- grade oils. This nonconformance was more noticeable in the bench test results than in the laboratory engine test data. The control oil (ARO- 11 3), which did not contain a V.l. improver, showed a measurable viscosity increase in the 1500 mile field tests. This indicates that factors other than mechanical shear may have influenced the viscosity changes of the multigrade oils in the field tests. Discussion: W. A.

Kendrick, Oronite Addi- tives Div., Chevron Chemical Co. Snowmobile field tests were conducted using a variety of two-cycle gasoline engines to evaluate deposit and scuffing control tendencies of lubricating oils com- pounded with several additive types. Results from these field studies showed that the BIA TC-W quality lubricant performs best in snowmobile engines. Specifically, this snowmobile field test which used higher fuel/oil ratios than are currently used showed that an ash-free amide additive as superior to either a low ash imide-sulfonate combination or an ash type sulfonate, and scuffing problems can be significantly reduced by the use of supplemental additives. 720956. (P-45) Effect of Long-Duration Impact on Head. V. R. Hodgson and L. M. Thomas, Wayne State University. Impacts have been analyzed in terms of degree of injury, head injury criterion (HIC), and average acceleration as a function of time for frontal impacts against the following surfaces: 1. Rigid flat surface - fractured cadaver skull. 2. Astroturf - head drop of football-helmeted cadaver. 3. Windshield penetrating impact of a dummy. 4. Airbag - dynamic test by human volunteers. It is concluded that the linear acceleration/time concussion tolerance curve may not exist and that only impacts against relatively stiff surfaces producing im- pulses with short rise times can be critical. The authors hypothesize that if a head impact does not contain a critical HIC interval of less than 0.015 s, it should be considered safe as far as cerebral concussion is concerned. 720957. (P-45) Parameter Study of Biomecbanical Quan- tities in Analytical Neck Models. B. M. Bowman and D. H. Robbins, Highway Safety Res. Institute, The University of Michigan. A parameter study is performed involving several ana- lytical vehicle occupant models in current use, with investigation of neck representations a primary goal. Side, oblique, and rear impact situations are investigated. Attention is given to the effects of varying head-neck mass and moments of inertia, anthropometry, muscle strength, and location, as well as strength of motion-limiting "stops." A model that replaces the conventional simple ball-joint neck with a two-joint, extensible neck is studied. This model also makes use of joint-stop ellipses to approximate the anatomical range for relatively free angular motion at a joint. Allowance is made for the effect of muscle contraction on occupant dynamics as a function of the degree of voluntary or involuntary tightening of the muscles, based upon experimental findings. A discrete parameter neck model that treats the cervical spine as a linkage of rigid vertebrae and massless, deformable discs is discussed briefly. It is determined that, besides being extensible and having at least two joints, three-dimen- sional neck representations should account for coupling between the forces resisting the three possible rotational motions - for example, yaw, pitch, and roll - that can occur between the head and the torso. 720958. (P-45) Improved Neck Simulation for Anthro- pometric Dummies. John W. Melvin, James H. McElhaney and Verne L. Roberts, Highway Safety Res. Institute, The University of Mich- igan. This paper describes the development of an improved neck simulation that can be adapted to current anthro- pometric dummies. The primary goal of the neck design is to provide a reasonable simulation of human motion during impact while maintaining a simple, rugged struc- ture. A synthesis of the current literature on cervical spine mechanics was incorporated with the results of x-ray studies of cervical spine mobility in human volunteers and with the analysis of head-neck motions in human volunteer sled tests to provide a background for the design and evaluation of neck models. Development tests on neck simulations were carried out using a small impact sled. Tests on the final prototype simulation were also performed with a dummy on a large impact sled. Both accelerometers and high-speed movies were used for performance evaluation. A mathematical model of the cervical spine was developed for the purpose of comparing the neck simulation responses to the results obtained from the human volunteer sled tests. The features of the final prototype neck simulation are discussed and comparisons are made with current dummy neck performance. 720959. (P-45) Mechanical Necks with Humanlike Re- sponses. C. C. Culver, R. F. Neathery and H. J. Mertz, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A viscoelastic neck structure that responds to impact environments in a manner similar to the human neck is described. The neck structure consists of four ball-jointed segments and one pin-connected "nodding" segment with viscoelastic resistive elements inserted between segments that provide bending resistance as well as the required energy dissipation. Primary emphasis was placed on developing appropriate flexion and extension responses with secondary emphasis placed on axial, lateral, and rotational characteristics. The methods used to design the resistance elements for the neck structure are discussed. Three variations of the resistive elements have been developed that meet the response characteristics specified by Mertz and Patrick. However, no single resistive element has satisfied the flexion and extension charac- teristics simultaneously, but such an element appears to be feasible. Additional efforts are required to assure proper performance when used in conjunction with a total dummy structure under a wider range of test conditions 199</page><page sequence="125">720960-720964 200 and to establish the durability required for this neck to serve as an adequate compliance test device. 720960. (P-45) Experimental Investigation on Injury Mechanisms of Cervical Spine at Frontal and Rear-Front Vehicle Impacts. H. J. Clemens, Anatomisches Institut der Freien Universität Berlin; and K. Burow, Institut für Kraft- fahrzeuge der Technischen Universität Berlin. This paper discusses the results of simulated head-on and rear-front vehicle crashes employing 53 human torsos. Measurements of deceleration of the head were taken, and the resulting injuries were noted. The most common and serious injury was to the cervical spine at the sixth vertebra. It is suggested that vehicle restraint systems be developed to avoid such injury, such as safety belts that would limit anteflexion of the head, airbags for head-on crash protection, and seat backs with integrated headrests to support the head at the e.g. 1972 SA E Transactions 720961. (P-45) Development and Validation of Computer Simulation of Crash Victim in Three Dimensions. John A. Bartz, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. A three-dimensional mathematical model of the crash victim has been developed and experimentally validated at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. The digital computer simulation includes a body dynamics model of 40 degrees of freedom and a contact model that generates forces from contact with vehicle surfaces, between body segments of the crash victim, and restraint forces from belts and inflatable restraints. The validity of the com- puter simulation was determined from comparisons of predicted responses with those measured in various experiments, including static bench tests, pendulum tests, impact sled tests, and a full-scale automobile crash test. Inputs to the computer program were based on detailed measurements of dummy characteristics and measured properties of the contact surfaces and restraints. The generally good agreement between the simulation and experimental results, plus the relatively low cost of exercising the model, demonstrate that the computer program is a useful engineering tool. 1972 SA E Transactions 720962. (P-45) User-Oriented Mathematical Crash Vic- tim Simulator. D. H. Robbins and R. O. Bennett, Jr., Highway Safety Res. Institute, The Univer- sity of Michigan. During recent years, the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) has developed and validated two- and three-dimensional models describing the motions and forces acting upon an occupant during a collision. These inexpensive-to-operate models are performing with ap- proximately 90% accuracy in parametric studies of classical crash configurations. In our own validation procedures, contacts with automobile development and design groups, and discus- sions with federal agencies, certain shortcomings of mathematical modeling procedures have been isolated. These include primarily the inability of the user to determine and input data to the computer programs and also to specify force, motion, velocity, and acceleration output data in a form applicable to the various vehicle design, human tolerance, and compliance tasks for which the models have been developed. As a part of the development of a new six-mass, three-dimensional crash victim simulator, a user-oriented interactive input/output language (OVERLORD) has been developed and is operational at HSRI. The objective of this tool is to make use of the HSRI and other similar models accessible to persons not highly trained in computer use. The program itself selects and positions the occupant in the vehicle and then automatically conducts the simulation. This is accomplished in a "conversation" between the user and the computer. The program asks the user certain basic questions such as: 1. What percentile occupant do you desire? 2. What is the impact velocity as well as type and direction of impact? 3. What standard vehicle geometry is desired - stan- dard, compact, subcompact? The new three-dimensional model and the OVER- LOAD program that prepares the input data, executes the computer run, and submits the output back to the user are described in detail in the paper. Comparisons between the predictions of the new model, predictions of the older HSRI three-dimensional crash victim simulator, and experimental data are included in the paper. 720963. (P-45) Nonlinear Viscoelastic Model for Head Impact Injury Hazard. Roger C. Haut, Charles W. Gadd and Richard G. Madeira, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This study explores the application of viscoelastic mod- eling for characterization of the response of the brain to impulsive loading with the objective of learning whether such models could exhibit the same time dependency of strain or likelihood of injury, as exhibited by the Severity Index, HIC Index, Wayne Tolerance Curve, and other similar representations of tolerance. The mathematical relationships between viscoelastic properties and the corresponding time dependency of tolerance are shown for Newtonian, Bingham plastic, and Pseudo-Bingham, as well as more general behavior. Preliminary static and dynamic tests upon small mammalian material are described with particular atten- tion given to strain in the vicinity of the brainstem as a function of loading profile. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that the falling time dependency of the above indexes can be interpreted in terms of nonlinear viscoelastic response. 1972 SA E Transactions 720964.

Schneider and A. M. Nahum, University of California, San Diego. The dynamic responses of the human skull and facial bones have been determined by a series of impact experiments. A preliminary report was issued on this subject with particular reference to three impact sites of the skull - the frontal, temporoparietal, and zygomatic. This work has been extended to include more experiments in these areas to delineate further the nature and reliability of the earlier data. In addition, new data have been obtained for maxilla, mandible, and zygomatic arch in order to include additional anatomic sites that are frequently involved in accidental impacts. Relationships to impulse duration, peak force, and various anatomic characteristics have been studied and will also be presented. Additional data have been obtained for unembalmed anatomic specimens to provide new infor- mation to supplement and expand the tolerance base reported in the preliminary study. 720966. (P-45) Injury Mechanisms in Rollover Collisions. Philip V. Hight, Arnold W. Siegel and Alan M. Nahum, University of California, San Diego. This paper presents conclusions of a study of rollover collisions and the injuries resulting from them. The injury severity, the type of injury, the body region injured, the frequency of injury, and the injury mechanism are all indicated. The study includes statistics on both restrained and unrestrained occupants, and shows that ejected occupants usually sustain more severe injury than con- tained occupants. Several conclusions are presented as to automobile structures in relation to injury. 1972 SA E Transactions 720967. (P-45) Injury Frequency and Head Restraint Effectiveness in Rear-End Impact Accidents. John D. States, John C. Balcerak, James S. Williams, Alexander T. Morris, William Babcock, Robert Polvino, Paul Riger and Raymond E. Dawley, University of Rochester. All of the rear-end impact accidents occurring in the city of Rochester, New York, in a three-month period were surveyed by tabulation of the police accident reports. Special police information forms, telephone interviews, and mail questionnaires were used for further data acquisition. Vehicle photographs and medical examina- tions were conducted for approximately every 20th vehicle and occupant. During the data collection period, 691 rear-end impacts occurred. Although a computer program revealed 1371 accidents, defects in the program accounted for the large difference. Whiplash injury frequency based on telephone interview and mail questionnaire data obtained one to seven days after the accident revealed a whiplash injury frequency of 38%, which was approximately twice that determined by on-scene police investigators. Head restraints reduced whiplash injury frequency by 24% and fixed head restraints appeared to be more effective. Seventy percent of adjustable head restraints were in the downmost position. Women sustained whiplash injury more frequently (51%) but benefited from head restraints more (whiplash injury frequency 38%). An extensive review of the literature related to whiplash injury and head restraint design and effec- tiveness is presented. 1972 SA E Transactions 720968. (P-45) Car Crash Collision Types and Passenger Injuries in Dependency Upon Car Construction (Field Studies of the German Automobile Insur- ance Companies). K. Langwieder, Association of Third Party, Accident and Motor Traffic Insur- ers (HUK-Verband) (Germany). In order to contribute to the improvement of traffic safety, the German Motor Traffic Insurers investigated 100,000 accidents in 1969. In dependency upon crash conditions, injuries were related to clearly described car models. The method used in commented upon in detail. This paper deals with the representative material on 10,271 car crashes with passenger injuries. It is shown what types of impact are found in real-life collisions and at what speeds they occur. Facts influencing accident severity are discussed. It turned out that car crashes occur mostly at a collision speed below 60 km/h. Frequently, serious injuries are sustained in cases with moderately severe car damage. This fact is proved by fractures of the skull base, of the cervical spine, of the sternum, of the pelvis, and of the lower extremities, as well as eye injuries. An important percentage of casualties occur in average crash severity. Influencing facts resulting from the car construction generating these kinds of injury are discussed. Effectiveness and possibilities of safety measures, such a safety belts, head restraints, and airbags, were studied with the aid of real-life collisions. It turned out that safety belts today offer the best protective effect. The present data on types of accident and correlating car damage and injuries furnish indications with regard to realistic experimental car tests. 720969. (P-45) Head Model for Impact. V. R. Hodgson, Wayne State University, M. W. Mason; and L. M. Thomas, Wayne State University. A human head model has been developed primarily for use in evaluation of impact attenuation properties of football helmets, but is also applicable in automobile 201</page><page sequence="127">720970-720974 202 impact safety tests. Using firm silicon rubber molds made from impressions of cadaver bones, a skull and mandible were each cast in one piece using a self-skinning urethane foam that hardens into cross section geometry similar to the human bone. A rubber gel material is used to simulate the brain. The skull and attached mandible are overlayed with repairable silicon rubber skin having puncture and sliding-over-bone characteristics similar to human skin. At present, the model has a rudimentary solid silicon rubber neck, through the center of which runs a flexible steel cable attached at the foramen magnum. The cable is used to attach the head to a carriage or anthropometric dummy and can be adjusted in tension to give various degrees of flexibility. Response of the head is determined by a triaxial accelerometer mounted in a cavity in the skull that is located at the head e.g. and is conveniently accessible from beneath the mandible. Static load-deflection tests and impacts have been conducted on both the model and several cadavers. Results show that the response of the model falls into the cadaver range so that injury indexes can be applied directly to the model. The model is rugged, repeatable, and practical to use in situations where either protection is worn on the head or a frangible headform is desired. 720970. (P-45) Pathophysiologic Responses to Rotational and Translational Accelerations of the Head. T. A. Gennarelli, L. E. Thibault and A. K. Ommaya, National Institutes of Health and Georgetown Univ. Acceleration- time data in 25 squirrel monkeys subjected to controlled sagittal plane head motions are presented. In 12 of the 25 animals subjected to pure translation of the head at peak positive g levels ranging between 665-1230 g (6-8 ms duration), cerebral concussion was not obtainable. In contrast, 13 of the animals subjected to head rotations at peak positive tangential (at e.g.) g levels ranging between 348-1025 g (5.5-8 ms duration) were all concussed. Visible brain lesions were noted in both translated and rotated groups but with a greater frequency and severity after rotation. An analysis of the lesions produced in both groups is presented, along with our preliminary data on the use of the evoked somatosensory réponse as an objective, quantifiable index for the onset and severity of brain damage in head injury. 720971. (P-45) The Dynamic Performance of Child Seating Systems. Verne L. Roberts and James H. McElhaney, Highway Safety Res. Institute, The University of Michigan. In a previous study, an extensive study of the dynamic performance of child seating systems indicated that little protection was provided under circumstances other than panic braking. This study was performed with impact test conditions of 30 mph frontal and 20 mph lateral and rear barrier impacts with seating systems meeting the re- quirements of FMVSS 213. Additionally, the performance of prototype seats developed under contract with the Department of Transportation under similar test condi- tions will be presented to compare the protective qualities available with seats of current design and those that could become available in the future. The performance of the child seats will be evaluated using two criteria, motion limits and acceleration limits. It is believed that the performance of child seats can be determined without the extensive test equipment and facilities required for adult seating and restraint systems. 1972 SAE Transactions 720972. (P-45) Biomechanics of Seat Belt Design. James H. McElhaney, Verne L. Roberts and John W. Melvin, Highway Safety Res. Institute, The University of Michigan; William Shelton and Albert J. Hammond, Ford Motor Co. This paper discusses the development of adequate criteria and evaluation methods for seat belt restraint design. These criteria should include the effect of seat belts in abdominal injury as well as head injury. It is concluded that belt load limiters and energy-absorbing devices should limit head-to-vehicle contact, ensure that the lap belt maintains proper contact with the bony pelvic girdle, and limit the belt loads. Studies are made of pulse shape and belt fabrics. Currently available mathematical models are used for the studies included in the paper. 1972 SAE Transactions 720973. (P-45) Effectiveness of Safety Belts under Var- ious Directions of Crashes. D. Cesari, R. Quincy and Y. Derrien, Organisme National de Sécurité Routière. Studies of the effectiveness of safety belts were carried out under various directions of crashes, including dynamic sled investigations, destructive barrier tests, and impact tests. The studies showed that three-point belts were effective in frontal impact from 0-30 deg, but that their effectiveness diminished after 45 deg because the belt slips off the chest. The three-point belt did not provide protection for the knees. The studies also pointed out that the anchorage system of the belt is a very important factor in its effectiveness. 1972 SAE Transactions 720974. (P-45) Impact Tolerance and Resulting Injury Patterns in the Baboon: Air Force Shoulder Harness-Lap Belt Restraint. Thomas D. Clarke, David C. Smedley, William H. Muzzy, C. Dee Gragg, Robert E. Schmidt and Edwin M. Trout, 6571st Aeromedicai Research Lab., Holloman AFB. The tolerance to abrupt linear deceleration (-Gx) and impact trauma patterns resulting from the use of the Air Force shoulder harness-lap belt restraint were investi- gated. Eighty-nine deceleration tests were performed with 37 adult male baboons. Peak sled decelerations ranged from 6.5-134 g. The stopping distance varied from 0.5-3.5 ft at 6 in increments.</page><page sequence="128">720975-720978 LD50s were calculated to be 102, 103, and 98 g for the 0.5, 2.0, and 3.5 ft stopping distances, respectively. Since the deceleration pulses were similar, the results imply that for the exposure range of these tests, impact lethality is dependent upon the magnitude of peak sled deceleration, irrespective of the pulse duration, sled velocity, or stopping distance. At all stopping distances, the primary cause of death was lower brainstem or cervical spinal cord trauma. The pelvic, abdominal, and thoracic injury patterns were significantly different at the various stopping distances. Animals impacted at the 0.5 ft stop typically displayed no significant injuries other than head-neck trauma. The predominant injuries at the 2.0 ft stop included pelvic and abdominal myorrhexis, intestinal herniation, urinary bladder rupture, and pelvic fractures in addition to luxation of cervical through thoracic vertebrae. At the 3.5 ft stop animals received extensive muscular and skeletal injuries of the pelvic, abdominal, and thoracic regions. Brainstem hemorrhage was a significant finding, but there was no evidence of luxation or fractures of cervical vertebrae. 1972 SAE Transactions 720975. (P-45) Rear Seat Inflatable Occupant Restraint System. David J. Romeo and Richard A. Rose, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. The program objective was to develop an effective inflatable occupant restraint system for unbelted rear seat occupants of motor vehicles. An extensive series of developmental and evaluative impact sled tests included variations in occupant position and size using a standard- size American sedan as the basic vehicle for incorporation of the passive restraint. The restraint system includes a crushable honeycomb knee bar to limit femur loads and to control the head and upper torso trajectory of the unbelted occupants. At speeds below which the airbag deploys, protection is provided by energy-absorbing padding on a head bar as well as on the knee bar. For high-speed crashes, the airbag deploys, and the bag loads are carried out through the head bar and the knee bar support plate. Nondeployed protection is provided for crash speed pulses up to approximately 20 mph in order to satisfy multiple impact considerations, and nonvented side bags are used for oblique impact protection. In terms of present injury criteria, the restraint was effective for the 50th percentile adult for crash speeds up to 45 mph for frontal and 30 deg oblique sled simulated barrier crashes. A performance envelope of crash speed at which protection is provided for other dummy sizes and positions was obtained. 1972 SA E Transactions 720976. (P-45) Safety Performance of Shaped Steering Assembly Airbag. Lawrence M. Patrick and Gerald W. Nyquist, Wayne State University; and Kenneth R. Trosien, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses a program wherein studies were made of forward force simulations of crashes and destructive barrier crashes using a shaped steering assembly airbag. It was shown that the airbag offered the best protection when compared with the performance of lap belts and lap and shoulder belt combinations. This shaped airbag deploys between the abdomen and the steering wheel and between the head and the steering wheel, thus providing protection of these two important areas. 1972 SAE Transactions 720978.
