<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Zoological Connection: Animal- Related Human Behavior* CLIFTON D. BRYANT, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University ABSTRACT Sociologists have been derelict in their failure to address the zoological component in human interaction and attendant social systems. Even a cursory examination of our language and other cultural inventory reveals a discernible animal influence on our social lives and behavior which has been largely neglected by sociological researchers. In this connection, several investigative directions in studying animal-related human behavior would seem to hold particular productive research promise. Research might be profitably directed at such topics as animals as social problems, ideological conflicts involving animals, the human-animal interface attendant to work, the animal as surro- gate human, and animal-related crime and deviancy. As sociologists interested in understanding human behavior in all of its vagaries, we might be well- advised to add animal to the lexicon of our discipline, and so turn our research attention to the "zoological connection." We might accordingly come to per- ceive whole new vistas of behavioral linkages and social causation. Sociologists, among the practitioners in most of the behavioral sciences and many of the humanities, have been singularly derelict in their failure to address the zoological component in human interaction and attendant social systems. We have tended not to recognize, to overlook, to ignore, or to neglect (some critics might say deservedly so) the influence of animals, or their import for, our social behavior, our relationships with other humans, and the directions which our social enterprise often takes. Humanists have long explored the presence, function, and sym- bolism of animals in art, literature, and theater at various periods of history (as illustrations, see Antal and Harthan; Clark; Hastings; McSpadden; Toyn- bee; Zuelke). Social historians in both trade and scholarly treatises have addressed the relationship of man and various beasts in myriad social contexts, and including a wide variety of species, such as the wolf (Lopez), *Presidential address delivered at the annual meeting of the Southern Sociological Society, 1979. Many of my colleagues in the Department of Sociology at VPI &amp; SU made valuable suggestions for this paper for which I would like to thank them.

Other writers (Carson; Dembeck) have spoken to the human-zoological interface among animals in general. Animals are often a constituent indirect factor in human illness and in this connection, social epidemiologists have documented the epizootic relationship between man and beasts, perhaps the classic statement being Hans Zinsser's exposition on the etiology of typhus, Rats, Lice, and History. Similarly, behavioral scientists other than sociologists, have examined the interface of animals and human social behavior. Economists have spoken to the question of the financial consequences of many modes of animal oriented activities from sheep raising, to horse racing, to the consumption of fried chicken. Likewise, there is an extensive anthropological literature which treats a wide spectrum of animal involvements in human culture ranging from Levi-Strauss' (a) statement on totemism to Wissler's classic paper on the influence of the horse in the development of plains Indian culture in the United States, and from Williams comments on animal refer- ences and themes in the communication among members of a black pente- costal church to Jordan's insightful analysis of the relationships of the dog and human in the rural South. Psychiatrists have also probed the relation- ship of animals and humans (Heiman), as have veterinarians (Leigh). Sociologists, on the other hand, have often been myopic in their observations of human behavior, cultural patterns, and social relationships, and unfortunately have not taken into account the permeating social influ- ence of animals in our larger cultural fabric, and our more idiosyncratic individual modes of interaction and relationships, in their analyses of social life. With very few exceptions, the sociological literature is silent on this topic. This discussion seeks to move sociological attention in a more zoo- logical direction. To this end, I hope the following comments, illustrations, and suggested investigative directions will be sensitizing to the researcher. ' The zoological bent of our social enterprise can be readily discerned by even a casual examination of our cultural inventory. Sensitivity to this influence and preoccupation can serve to highlight the sociological signifi- cance of animal-related human behavior, and better elucidate the import of such behavior for a larger society. Animals and Language Saturation An extensive behavioral science literature indicates that the language of a given society may well reflect the cultural preoccupations of the society as evidenced by the inclusion of an inordinate number of words, expressions, and nuances pertaining to these concerns and preoccupations in the lan- guage repertoire (as an illustration, see Lindesmith and Strauss). Eskimos,</page><page sequence="3">Zoological Connection / 401 for example, preoccupied with survival in their cold environment, have an elaborate set of words which refer to minute distinctions among different kinds of snow and snowfall (Hiller). The Arabs are said to have approxi- mately six thousand words which refer in some fashion to camels (Kline- berg), and the Solomon Islanders, presumably as with other societies in the South Pacific, have numerous terms which refer to the coconut (Lewis). It is possible to identify many other societies whose language demonstrates some distinctive cultural preoccupation. In our own society, the quantita- tive bent of our language, and our elaborate vocabularies for automobiles and for sports activities reveals some of our cultural proclivities. Perhaps equally obvious is the language that reflects the particular concerns and preoccupations of many subcultural groups in our society and others. Less recognized, however, is the fact that the language of our own society is heavily saturated with zoological references, which suggest a greater influence of, and involvement with, and preoccupation with, ani- mals than we are prone to recognize or admit. Words, phrases, metaphors, similies, analogies, etc., redolent of animals are abundant in our language to a degree that invites sociological explanation. In appearance we have "buck teeth," a "lpony tail," are "pigeon-toed," have "crow's feet under our eyes," or look "ratty." A blind date may be a real "dog." In physical ability, condition, or characteristic, individuals may be "fat as a hog," "an old goat," "hungry as a bear," "strong as an ox," "smell like a goat," as "busy as a beaver," "eat like a horse," "like a bird," "blind as a bat," or "sick as a dog." In temperament, we may be "gentle as a lamb," or "mean as a snake," "pig-headed," "bull-headed," "stubborn as a mule," "lion- hearted," "quiet as a mouse," or a real "son-of-a-bitch." In terms of demeanor, behavioral proclivity, and/or attitudinal persuasion, one may be a "night owl," "book-worm," "silly-goose," "sex-kitten," "cool cat," "stud," "scaredy cat," "foxy lady," "catty," "sly as a fox," "slippery as an eel," or "quick like a bunny." We may be "hot to trot," make an "ass of ourselves," "horse around," "cat around," "cry wolf," "be a scape goat," "get our feathers ruffled," "get the lion's share," "be a monkey's uncle," a "lame duck" politician, "bark up the wrong tree," throw "snake eyes" in dice, be "hen pecked," or "let the cat out of the bag." We live in a "dog eat dog" world, get our information "straight from the horse's mouth," have a "whale of a time" at a party, take "Mickey Mouse" courses in school, "bug out" in combat, "live high on the hog" in affluent times and if we are really confronted with a problem we may well be able to "weasel out of it." Time and space limitations obviously preclude an exhaustive recita- tion of animal-related language component to our society's culture. It suffices to say that our language does have an extraordinarily high satura- tion level in this regard. This strong zoological flavor in our language would suggest a considerable animal influence in our cultural fabric.</page><page sequence="4">402 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 Other Zoological Dimensions in Culture Preoccupation with animals does not stop with zoological analogies and metaphors. We are inordinately prone to label much of our material culture with animal labels, titles, designations, and other appellations, again to a degree that begs explanation. Our children play with teddy bears, eat animal crackers (more recently our pets eat people crackers), and save their allowances in piggy banks. We adults wear Hush Puppy or Bass-Wejun shoes; Alligator shirts, turtle-neck sweaters and shark-skin suits; smoke Lark or Camel cigarettes (or use Bull Durham tobacco if we roll our own) or White Owl cigars, which we light with a Cricket lighter. For those of other nicotine persuasion, a plug of Red Fox or Bull of the Woods chewing tobacco may hit the spot. We refresh ourselves with Gator Aid, and for something stronger may imbibe cold duck wine, White-Horse scotch or Wild Turkey bourbon, with perhaps a bit of longhorn cheese for a hors- d'oeuvre. One of our favorite foods is a hot dog. We drive Rabbits, Impalas, Foxes, Mustangs, Firebirds, Jeeps (jeeps, as older persons will recall, were originally small animals in Popeye cartoons), and put "tigers in our tank," according to a well-known gasoline commercial. We shine our shoes with Kiwi polish and our automobiles with turtle-wax, and wash ourselves with Dove soap and our pots and pans with 20-Mule Team Borax. You can always tell a good-old-boy-he'll be wearing a Caterpillar Tractor cap. At another level our literature and art forms are also heavily linked with animals. Basic to children's literature are stories such as Goldilocks and the Three Bears, The Little Red Hen, The Three Little Pigs, and Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf, not to mention the Uncle Remus stories and Brer Rabbit. One of the most enduring novels in the English language is Black Beauty, a story purportedly told by a horse in the first person; Bambi was a book-of-the-month selection in 1928, and a recent best selling novel made into a very popular movie was Watership Down, a story whose main charac- ters are rabbits. Other books with animal titles might include The Yearling, Animal Farm, The Painted Bird, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Like our books, many of our movies have had zoological themes, plots or references. Examples here would be Day of the Dolphin, The Birds, Born Free, King Kong, Jaws, Straw Dogs, Dog-Day Afternoon, Orca, Daktari, The Pink Panther, Animal House, The Swarm (about killer bees), Willard, Francis the Talking Mule, To Kill a Mockingbird, and The Owl and the Pussycat. Theater also reveals the zoological connection. One of the most beloved plays of our time is Harvey, where a seminal character is an invisible seven-foot high rabbit. More recently, the play Equus, about a youth who blinds horses, has fascinated theater goers. Among other plays that either involve animals or use similies or metaphors in the title are Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Night of the Iguana, and The Voice of the Turtle to mention a few.</page><page sequence="5">Zoological Connection / 403 Similarly, many of our most popular television programs have in- volved animals in some fashion. Here could be listed Lassie, Mr. Ed, Gentle Ben, The Muppets. Some of our most famous actors and performers have been animals. Consider Rin-Tin-Tin, Trigger, J. Fred Muggs (the world's most successful chimpanzee), and of course Cheeta (Tarzan's chimpanzee), not to mention Arnold (the pig in Green Acres). Among the most famous Americans in history (and in all the world) are imaginary animals-Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, and Donald Duck. Even some of our imaginary, hu- man, comic book characters have animal names, such as Batman and Robin, and Red Ryder's sidekick, Little Beaver. A substantial number of our songs over the years have had zoologi- cal titles or references. Here could be included Three Little Fishes, My Heart Goes Where the Wild Goose Goes, How Much is That Doggie in the Window, Bye Bye Blackbird, Turkey In The Straw and You Ain't Nothing but a Hound Dog. Perhaps the most popular musical group in history was the Beatles, from Britain. For those persons of classical taste there are Swan Lake and Madame Butterfly. Our leisure activities are very much dominated by animal oriented behavior. Among our favorite recreational pursuits are horse and dog rac- ing, cock-fighting, hunting and fishing, bird-watching, horseback riding, attending dog and other animal shows, visiting zoos, attending circuses and rodeos,2 tropical fish raising, practicing taxidermy, and leering at Play- boy bunnies. Even some of our most celebrated athletic teams have animal names in totemic fashion. Consider the Chicago Bears, the Atlanta Falcons, the Detroit Lions, and the Miami Dolphins. Animals are seminally constituent to many of our holidays and spe- cial occasions. We have Santa's reindeer at Christmas, the Easter Bunny, the Thanksgiving turkey, the black cat at Halloween, and Ground Hog Day. The Zoological Influence on Behavior Encyclopedic volumes might be written listing zoological elements and traits in our culture. But the animal influence in our social life goes beyond mere semantic novelty. There is virtually no area of social life that is un- touched by animals. The particular configuration which our social behavior assumes results in many instances from a zoological consideration. The crowing rooster wakes us up in the morning and the last thing we do at night is walk the dog, or let the cat out. Animals and insects sometimes interfere with our picnics, and in institutionalized fashion, we eat fish on Friday. Taking home a doggie bag has become constituent to the ritual of restaurant behavior, and a mink coat may break up a marriage or save one, depending on whether it is given to the mistress or the wife. In some rural parts of the country, most work stops and schools let out on the opening</page><page sequence="6">404 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 day of deer season, and the table fare of many families depends on whether the husband is a hunter. A recent scientific study showed that people who have a dog (or other kind of pet) are more likely to survive a heart attack (Friedmann and Katcher). Some individuals may bankrupt themselves betting on the ponies, and others may legitimate their high social status by riding to the hounds. The apartment one rents may depend on whether pets are allowed. Our social relationships are often shaped by animals. It may be easier for boy to meet girl (or vice-versa) if they are both walking their dogs. Two individuals may sustain a friendship over time by being hunting companions, and a young childless married couple may find that their mutual concern for a pet dog or cat gives them a shared interest which strengthens and nour- ishes their marriage. In the war on poverty a few years back, it was dis- covered that some ghetto families were strengthened by discharging the mutual responsibility of taking turns staying up at night to protect sleeping infants from being attacked by rats. In effect, the family that fights rats together stays together. An individual whose tom cat yowls all night may well discern that his neighbors are less than cordial in their interaction with him. Making enemies is facilitated by criticizing someone's horse or kicking someone's dog, but the best way to ingratiate one's self with the neighbor's children is to acquire a monkey. Individuals who collect snakes seem to have fewer friends who visit them than do most people, and persons who have a moosehead hanging over their fireplace mantle are probably less likely to be asked to join exclusive upper-class clubs. (John P Marquand, as may be recalled, in his novel, The Late George Appley had Appley, the protagonist, object to his son's girl friend because her parents were, in his opinion, gauche enough to have an iron deer in their front yard.) One can lose the respect of friends (or the respect of the public: remember LBJ and his beagles) by mistreating a pet, gain public admiration by riding a bucking bronco or a Brahman bull, become newsworthy by catching an inordinately large fish,3 enhance one's political chances in an election by appearing on television with a dog, and become a social outcast (at least temporarily) by having an encounter with a skunk. The Sociological Study of Human-Animal Relations In spite of the evident prominence of zoological influences in our culture and the subsequent import for our social lives, the sociological literature is largely silent on animal-related human behavior. This is an unfortunate oversight which handicaps our acquisition of a comprehensive under- standing of our social enterprise. Sociological research on animal-related human behavior might well yield additional valuable insights concerning</page><page sequence="7">Zoological Connection / 405 the interactional process, social motivation, the influence of value systems on perception, socialization and personality development, human violence and its sublimation, and the social dynamics of anthropomorphism. In this connection, several investigative directions in studying animal-related be- havior would seem to hold particularly sociological promise and the remain- der of our comments will address such directions. THE ANIMAL AS SOCIAL PROBLEM Historically and cross-culturally animals have sometimes been social prob- lems, or key elements in social problems. Man-eating tigers disrupt village life in rural India. Locusts destroy crops everywhere and precipitate fam- ines. Contaminated oyster beds in Chesapeake Bay may put large numbers of watermen out of work. The infants of the poor in slum areas are some- times attacked by rats. Discovery of an endangered species in a strategic location may halt a technological project that might have brought employ- ment to thousands and progress to millions, and an insect like the boll weevil impoverished an entire region for decades. Human behavior and values are often inextricably interwoven with animal behavior in convo- luted configurations that may assume dysfunctional dimensions for the social enterprise. Some countries in Europe have recently embarked on massive fox extermination programs because of an incipient rabies epidemic (Clark and Nater), and only a few years ago, the police of Reykjavik, Iceland were forced to shoot thousands of dogs kept as pets in violation of local ordi- nances. In Iceland, dogs other than farm animals have long been considered a social nuisance and hazard and accordingly outlawed. In our own country, we are confronted with both extant and poten- tially serious animal-related social problems.4 Our dog and cat population, for example, is approximately one-half that of the human population and growing at a much faster rate (2,000 to 3,500 puppies and kittens are born each hour as compared to 415 human beings). (See Djerassi et al.) Hunger and famine are widespread in the world, and only a short time back we were being asked not to eat meat one day a week to make more food available. It may therefore be difficult to rationalize to the world the fact that each day our pet dogs and cats eat as much food as can be carried in a freight train 12 miles long. In 1974, Americans spent 2.5 billion dollars for more than 150 varieties of pet food, six times the amount spent on baby food. This year the figure will be almost twice as much. Upwards of 200 million dollars is spent annually on television advertising by the pet food industry. This pet food is not produced without the use of energy which is now in short supply. Our dogs litter the streets and parks of our country to a degree that is both disagreeable and unhealthy. Each day our dogs produce 3,500 tons of feces and 36 million liters of urine (Djerassi et al.). In</page><page sequence="8">406 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 some large cities like New York, the parks are becoming little more than manure heaps, and children playing in the parks are touching and eating dog feces which harbour the eggs and nematode larvae of a worm which produces the disease Toxacara canis which in turn can cause a variety of physiological disorders in humans including brain and liver damage, con- vulsions, blindness, and even death. Our dogs are biting hundreds of thousands of persons each year- 38,000 in New York alone. This is an increase of 43 percent over the past eight years in New York. Each year persons, and especially children, are attacked by dogs, and savagely mauled, maimed, and even killed. The cost of livestock loss from wild dogs is counted in the millions, and in a nation where adequate health services are not always available to humans, we are spending billions annually for veterinary medical care for dogs and cats. The dog is simply one animal that is an element in some of our potentially serious social problems. Assuming a Malthusian increase in dogs and cats, what portends for our society when the number of these animals exceeds the human population? The possibilities and consequences are awesome. Given our affinity for companion animals and certain emerging social value systems in regard to animals, any effective means of ameliorat- ing or resolving the situation may be socially disruptive, if not economically chaotic. There are other animals and other problems but the social import of much animal-related human behavior would seem to be a sociologically fertile realm of study and research for students of societal dysfunctions and disorganization. THE ANIMAL AS SENTIENT CREATURE Certain operative value systems in our society mandate conceptualizing the animal as a sentient creature, possessed of sensibilities and sensitivi- ties, and endowed with certain inalienable basic rights to be free from pain and suffering imposed through human tyranny and exploitation. Such value systems have recently crystallized into a concerted social movement bearing the name "animal liberation" (Singer). This movement is gathering considerable impetus and its recent momentum is increasingly bringing it into conflict with various value systems, of technological, economic, or social mode, with which it is unalterably incompatible. The collision of such value systems is not without significant social and economic implica- tion. It may be recalled that concern for whales in our society, and activism in this regard, resulted in legislation that caused the demise of an entire industry, the American whaling industry. Similar concern for dolphins is having its impact on the tuna fishing industry because of resultant legisla- tion that severely handicaps tuna fishing techniques. In Europe "animal liberation" already has achieved considerable success and animal husband-</page><page sequence="9">Zoological Connection / 407 ry there is burdened by an incredible array of regulatory legislation moti- vated by animal welfare concerns. In Denmark, for example, laying hens must now by law be maintained in a yard rather than in a wire cage. The most efficient implementation of poultry science technology calls for the maintenance of laying hens in cages. There is wide concern and appre- hension among agricultural scientists and persons in agribusiness that if we should follow the European and British lead in the treatment of farm animals, or even go beyond them, our agricultural capacity might be crip- pled beyond our ability to feed our farm population, much less export food. Thus, we could have a social dilemma involving the rights of a chicken to have a "natural" quantity of exercise room (Singer) versus the rights of an American to be able to afford eggs even if on only a modest income. There are other incipient dilemmas in the "animal liberation" con- troversy. Major recreational and occupational activities such as trapping, hunting, horse and dog racing, greyhound coursing, rodeo, and cock- fighting, to name some, are all threatened by the controversy and possible legal reforms that may be generated by animal welfare concerns and the attendant efforts of its adherents. Our technology makes heavy use of animals for laboratory testing but long-standing opposition to the practice, such as the anti-vivisectionist movement, is intensifying. Recently India has halted the exportation of rhesus monkeys for research purposes (Time). Our country's scientific laboratories had previously been importing up- wards of 20,000 monkeys annually, mostly rhesus monkeys for experimen- tal purposes. The monkey ban is creating serious concern among many research scientists who fear that some research programs may be imperiled. In 1973, the story became public that indicated that the U.S. Air Force intended to use 200 beagle dogs to test poisonous gases. As a result, "the Defense Department received more letters of protest than it had received about the bombing of North Vietnam" (Regan and Singer). Some countries have moved to severely restrict and regulate the use of animals for labora- tory purposes. One country, Liechtenstein, does not allow the use of ani- mals for such purposes. The future of large segments of U.S. scientific research may well be imperiled by the current efforts to improve the lot of animals. The animal welfare dialogue is well rooted in history. Rene Descartes, the seventeenth century French mathematician and scientist conceptualized animals as a kind of beast-machine, as it were. Inasmuch as animals could not speak, it was assumed therefore that they could not think, and accordingly, could not feel. Malebranche, an intellectual heir of Descartes is said to have kicked his dog in order to hear the "creaking of the machine" (quoted in Carson). In opposition to the Cartesian view of animals as machine a formidable social opposition arose and continues to gain momentum until this day. The neo-Cartesian perspective survives however. Interestingly, Pope Pius II, for example, in speaking on the</page><page sequence="10">408 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 subject of the lower animals killed in a slaughter house or a laboratory, indicated that, "their cries should not arouse unreasonable compassion any more than do red-hot metals undergoing the blows of the hammer, seeds spoiling underground, branches crackling when they are pruned, grain that is surrendered to the harvester; wheat being ground by the milling machine" (quoted in Carson). Animal welfare controversy is assuming some unusual configura- tions. Animal welfare advocates from the United States are making clan- destine trips to the ice floes of Canada to spray indelible ink on harp seal pups to render them undesirable in the annual seal harvest-and being arrested in the process. In Hawaii, two laboratory assistants, fired with animal welfare zeal, absconded with two dolphins that were being used in important laboratory research, and let the animals free in the ocean (Associated Press, c). They were subsequently tried for first-degree theft. Although sociologists have traditionally found social controversy of en- gaging scientific interest, they have apparently viewed animal related controversy, social movements, or collective behavior as possessing little sociological relevance. The emerging social dilemmas and conflicts in this regard would surely seem to offer sociological vistas of tantalizing dimen- sions. From the standpoint of national need and the cultural equilibrium, sociologists would almost seem to have an implicit mandate to become involved in this morass of convoluted social value conflicts. There is an inconsistency and lack of logic in much of our societal animal values that invites analysis. After all, as one author put it, "Beat a cat and go to prison. Chase and kill a fox and become conceivably Master of the Hunt" (Carson). MAN, BEAST, AND WORK Sociological students of work and occupation have found little to interest them in the human-animal interface attendant to work, even though the systemic linkages are not inconsiderable. The history of the social enter- prise is, in large measure, a history of man and animal working together. In various societies we encounter horses, cattle, camels, water buffalo, llama, reindeer, elephants, or dogs, to name only a few species, as ubiqui- tous work animals. The resultant dyadic arrangement between man and beast is a most singular interactive relationship and could undoubtably provide enlightening and significant insights concerning personal identity, dyadic behavior, and the interface of anthropomorphic processes and social linkages, if probed sufficiently. The cowboy and his horse, the farmer and his mule, the organ grinder and his monkey, the miner and his jackass, the mahout and his elephant, and the shepherd and his dog to mention some of the vagaries of man-animal work teams to be encoun- tered, are classic examples of task-oriented social assemblages involving a human and one or more beasts. Inasmuch as the company of, and inter-</page><page sequence="11">Zoological Connection / 409 action with, an animal especially in some work-linked aggregations and attendant behavioral configurations, appears to satisfy at least partially, certain human interactive and communicative needs, it might well be that a better understanding of the sociopsychological parameters of loneliness and alienation, and the ameliorative mechanisms which most effectively address such states, can be obtained through systematic study of such aggregations. At a less abstract level, another man-animal work linkage with sociological import is the occupational specialty which is animal oriented or animal related. It should be recalled that a substantial proportion of our extant vocations, in fact, directly involve animals. The vocations range from professional specialties such as veterinary medicine to unskilled workers in poultry processing plants, and include occupations with widely varying concerns such as fisheries biologists who undertake to maximize zoological aquatic resources, game wardens who seek to optimize the ex- tant populations of wild game and fish through the enforcement of hunting and fishing laws, exterminators who attempt to minimize the number of unwanted and undesirable animal and insect populations, and taxidermists who strive to create the illusion of life in dead animals and fish through various preservative techniques. It is only in recent years that sociologists have undertaken to study occupations because of the animal connection.5 The animal oriented component of work does have implications for the dynamics of work performance and the development of occupational identity, and some of the studies of such occupations have revealed some interesting causal connections in this regard. In one study of veterinary medicine (Snizek and Bryant), for example, it was learned that there is a decided trend in the profession to elect or effect a small animal practice mode as opposed to a large animal or mixed practice mode. This decision is contrary to the original career plans of entering veterinary students and apparently results from a change in professional ideological orientation which occurs in the course of their training. This decision does not appear to be based so much on financial considerations, as on concerns bearing on the characteristics of the animal patient populations involved in the various practice modes, and the characteristics of the owners of the animals. It has been pointed out (Bryant and Snizek), that large animal veterinary practice is considerably less "medicalized" than small animal practice. A small animal practice mode permits a more effective, convincing and thus satis- fying, dramaturgical performance of the professional role, and the owners of small companion animals are a more responsive and appreciative audi- ence for such a performance. Thus, in the case of veterinary medicine, it is the animal connection that dictates professional role playing. The zoological component of some types of work has other socio- logically important implications. Animals may contribute to, or detract from, the relative occupational prestige of particular vocations, depending</page><page sequence="12">410 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 on the public context. The animal dimension may even be a significant factor in the degree of work satisfaction or disaffection which people expe- rience on the job. In a study of employee morale in a poultry processing plant (Bryant and King), what ostensibly appeared to be relatively un- pleasant or distasteful work, was well tolerated, and even enjoyed, by most of the workers, and one ameliorative consideration here appeared to be the fact that the workers were working with poultry. As one worker put it, "I like to work with chickens." It should not be overlooked that animals can and have successfully displaced humans in some work situations. Perhaps the most sociologically fascinating example of animals being employed in human work systems is the intriguing efforts of Verhave to train pigeons to work on a pharmaceu- tical company assembly line performing quality-control inspection work.6 This researcher was able to train the birds "to discriminate 'defective' gela- tin capsules from nondefective capsules." The results of the experiment were extremely encouraging and the way might well have been paved for a new industrial revolution where man was freed from monotonous and disaffective work by the employment of birds and beasts. Sociological con- siderations, unfortunately, brought the project and prospect to naught. As one writer describes the outcome: However, the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the research decided to abandon the project for a variety of reasons unrelated to the efficiency of the technique. The major deterrent to continuation was, as one might expect, the concern about public reaction. What consumer would be confident in the reliability of a drug, part of whose quality control was supervised by a pigeon? (Lubow, 34). Is it not reasonable to contemplate the possibility that in the future, animals may well replace people in performing certain odious work roles where the recruitment of a human work force is difficult, if not impossible? Perhaps even more fascinating to ponder is the prospect of some enterprising entre- preneur attempting to circumvent the minimum wage law by substituting animal workers for human employees. In our subsequent research studies of work and the social context, it might be profitable to example more fully the interpretive meaning and behavioral import of animal-related work for practitioner, and public. THE ANIMAL AS SURROGATE HUMAN Animals serve numerous functions in human society, but perhaps socio- logically, the most interesting function is filling statuses in social groups. Many animals in effect, are required to play the role of surrogate humans in many social contexts. Some animal trainers or keepers, like the elephant's mahout, may literally live with the beast. The gold miner's jenny often served as both sexual and social companion. Traditionally, in Indonesia, baby orangutans were sometimes reared in a human family almost in the</page><page sequence="13">Zoological Connection / 411 fashion of a child. Almost every conceivable kind of creature from snake to cat, and from horse to chimpanzee has been made to play the role of companion to human. It is the dog, however, that has been the principal in this regard, in our society. Claude Levi-Strauss (b) has observed that: " . . . dogs are relevant in connection . . . with . .. human society. . . because, having no social life of their own, they form a part of ours." We often take the view that a child needs a companion to grow up and interact with, and to provide an object of emotional attachment. The dog which the child receives becomes in effect, a surrogate brother or sister and usually plays the role well. Each may become protective of the other and both are intensely loyal. They may play together, sleep together, and even "talk" to each other. It has been noted that "communication may be established more easily with a pet than with a parent or relative" (Siegel). Children sometimes have imaginary pets before they have real pets. It has been suggested that a dog or other kind of pet is an essential component in the socialization of a child. The care of the pet develops responsibility, and the child can better "explore the environment" (Levinson, a). As Levinson puts it, "When he (the child) is accompanied by his trusted animal friend, he will not be afraid to try his skill and to compete with his peers." He then goes on to say that, "A child who is foiled or rebuffed in his attempt to make friends with his peers can find acceptance from his pet." Although it is popularly believed that a dog or pet has some impact on a child's social- ization, sociologists have not seen fit to explore such a possibility. It is interesting that the Icelanders do not think a child needs a dog or pet and thus there are relatively few such family pets in contrast to the U. S. pattern of a family which often includes a dog as well as children. The prospects of cross-cultural comparative studies of dogs and socialization are extremely inviting. The dog may even be a detrimental element in socialization. For the young childless couple, or in the years prior to having chil- dren, the pet dog often becomes a surrogate infant, and it is the dog who is the recipient of the love, affection, and attention that the infant would have received. When the infant does come, the dog accustomed to role of only child may become jealous and sulk. Dogs may become so integrated into a family that they develop emphathetic psychosomatic disorders when their owners are ill. One account (Fox) related the story of a dog who would have mild seizures when the husband and wife had a fight. Some- times a dog will become a part-time surrogate mother for a child and become over-protective to the point of inappropriateness or even danger to others. For the older couple, the dog may play the role of surrogate child to replace the grown child that has moved away. For many elderly persons, and especially widows or widowers the dog or other pet may become their major social contact and the majority of their interaction may be with the pet. In Great Britain much more so than in the United States, the cage bird</page><page sequence="14">412 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 is a popular pet with older people. The birds become, as some writers (Mugford and M'Comisky) have phrased it, "'little feathered human re- placements' for a distant or a neglected nuclear family." The seeing-eye dog becomes a surrogate caretaker for the blind, and dogs are recently being used as surrogate therapists for the mentally dis- turbed (Rynearson), or at least "co-therapist" (Levinson, b). The attach- ment of dogs and people is so great that the death of the owner may cause the dog to grieve itself to death, or the death of the dog may be as traumatic to the family as the loss of a child. The widespread presence of pet ceme- teries is vivid testimony to the degree of anthropomorphism involved in most human-dog relationships. It is not unusual to encounter tombstones, caskets, and even graveside services in the repertoire of human response to the death of a dog (or other pet). 7 We simply tend to use animals, and especially dogs, as replacement actors for people in our understaffed social groups. As Rynearson has phrased it, "It is natural for the child who has left home or the spouse who has died to be warmly surrogated by a pet." There is an increasing psycho- logical and psychiatric literature on the emotional attachment of humans and pets, and the social role of animals in human groups.8 Unfortunately, sociological interest in such topics has been minimal. Given some of the incipient trends in childless marriages, singlehood, widowhood, and the increase in the number of couples where children no longer live in the home, there would seem to be good reason to predict the increased reliance on pets as surrogate humans. In the face of such prospects and the in- creasing significance of human-pet relationships for the maintenance of emotional equilibrium and the amelioration of loneliness and alienation, within a context of ever more burdensome societal crises and pressures, would not a concerted sociological research effort focusing on individuals and their pets likely yield handsome insights concerning this neglected dimension of human relationships and social interaction.9 ZOOLOGICAL CRIME It is in the area of crime, delinquency, and deviancy that sociologists may perhaps encounter the most fertile phenomenological fields to plow. Animal related social norms in enormous variety are constituent to all societies, but seemingly especially our own. Violations of such norms may well be among the most ubiquitous of any social deviancy. With only a few recent exceptions (see for example Bryant and Palmer), the area of animal crime has been almost completely ignored by researchers. Animals can be the perpetrators of crime, the instigators of crime, and the victims of crime. They may also be the object of crime, the motivation for crime, the instru- ment of or for crime, and even the mechanism for the punishment of crime.</page><page sequence="15">Zoological Connection / 413 The New York killer, David Berkowitz, at one time claimed that he was instructed to murder by demons who spoke through the dog owned by his neighbor, Sam Carr, and in California recently an individual tried to murder a person with a rattlesnake.10 All manner of animals are being kidnapped for ransom and illegally captured dolphins bring $10,000 on the international black market. In the ghetto areas of our large cities, the poor survive by purchasing the cheap and illegal meat of wild game and birds. Cockfighting is a multi-million dollar, clandestine and often illegal, recreational pastime for hundreds of thousands of Americans (Bryant). Animal-related crime may well be among the oldest forms of sanc- tioned social norm violation. Prehistoric man like primitive folk peoples today, presumably had a well-developed conceptualization of fishing and hunting rights, prerogatives, privileges, and obligations. Encroachment on another's hunting or fishing rights, failing to observe appropriate amenities or obligations attendant to hunting or fishing such as the appropriate dis- tribution of killed game, or the theft of another's kill, would all constitute serious breaches of normative mandate and would disturb community equilibrium, precipitating serious sanctions in many instances. Among agri- cultural or pastoral peoples, the theft of livestock, or invasion of grazing space constitutes extremely serious deviant acts. In contemporary society the involvement of animals in the social enterprise has become increasingly convoluted and complex, and the pro- liferating number, and elaboration of, proscriptive and prescriptive norms relevant to animals and animal-related human behavior, has reached an incredible stage. Where in an earlier era one might be hanged as a horse thief, it is now possible to be prosecuted and punished for a bewildering array of animal related offenses ranging from parrot smuggling to annoying a whale. These can be arranged in at least five categories. Animals as Personal Property As mentioned above, horse theft was an endemic criminal activity on the American frontier, as was cattle rustling. Miscreants were dealt with swiftly and harshly. Animal theft is still a major mode of criminal activity. Cattle rustling is still widespread, as is the theft of other livestock. Florida ranchers alone, for example, lose $3,000,000 worth of beef cattle each year (Bryant and Palmer). Expensive race horses are tempting targets for thieves and extortionists. "Dognappers" steal dogs for ransom and other thieves steal dogs for resale to pet shops or scientific laboratories. In Burma, a 6-ton, 12-foot-tall elephant owned by an American firm was recently "elephant- napped" and held for $1,500 ransom (Associated Press, d). In the Chesa- peake Bay area, "oyster rustlers" steal oysters planted in leased beds at the bottom of the bay. The theft, appropriation of, or assault on, a man's beast, be it elephant or fish, is a crime against property and is a relatively frequent and widespread criminal offense.</page><page sequence="16">414 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 Animals as personal property may also be assaulted or killed. The owner of a pet poodle in Florida claimed that a dog groomer cut her pet while clipping the dog's hair causing the dog to "become traumatic" and frightening it out of its playful personality. She sued for $15,000 damages and the jury awarded $9,000. Several years ago in Tampa, Florida, a man who was unhappy with the number of animals kept in a subdivision, went on a shooting spree with a shotgun and killed a shetland pony owned by a neighbor, and two dogs in the neighborhood. He was arrested on a felony charge of malicious killing of animals (Associated Press, e). Animals as Public Property Fish and wildlife, in this country, are considered to be the corporate prop- erty of the public, and accordingly hunting, fishing, and trapping are regu- lated and controlled by both State and Federal legislation. Jurisdiction usually depends on whether the game in question is migratory or nonmi- gratory. The vagaries of game-law violations are among the more prevalent of all criminal offenses, and game wardens who enforce such laws wage a relentless war on "camouflage-collar criminals" (Palmer; Snizek et al.). Crimes against publicly owned creatures are recently assuming new and unusual configurations, however. This past year in Texas, three men were fined $6,000 in federal court, for conspiring to kill at least 70 federally protected golden eagles from a helicopter. The men had violated the Air- borne Hunting Act, in addition to killing protected birds. The men appar- ently were killing the eagles because they thought the birds were a menace to baby sheep and goats (United Press International, b). Several years ago, three corporations and four individuals were tried in federal court for illegal international trafficking in American alligator hides worth $700,000. At that time American alligators were on the endangered species list (New York Times). Federal law protects various undersea growths in national parks and elsewhere, but scuba divers are now stealing coral from the ocean floor because of the new jewelry fad, and facing prosecution as a result (United Press International, c). Today it is illegal to annoy or attack any marine mammal. When the carcass of a dead whale washed ashore on the U.S. East Coast a year or so back, curiosity seekers came to see the whale and some even carried a piece of the carcass away with them as a souvenir, without knowing that they were technically in violation of federal law. It is even a violation of the Creatures of the Shelf Act to have a lobster on board one's boat under some proscribed conditions. A few years ago a captain of an Italian fishing boat was caught in American waters with lobsters aboard and he was arrested, and his trawler seized by the U.S. Coast Guard (Townes). The company that owned the trawler was subse- quently fined $25,000 and the captain was released on probationary status for one year. He could have been fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for</page><page sequence="17">Zoological Connection / 415 one year. The broadening purview of animal-related laws will surely dra- matically increase the number of persons who violate these laws and are legally punished for their offenses. The Animal as Hazard or Nuisance Within some contexts, the animal is viewed as a hazard or a public nuisance and appropriate laws are enacted in an attempt to ameliorate the nuisance and prevent the hazard, and persons subsequently violate these laws. Perhaps the best known example of such offenses is the serpent-handling of various Appalachian fundamentalist, religious sects. Persons maintain- ing some patently dangerous animals as pets are often legally punished. One man in New York State, for example, was fined for keeping a mountain lion (Associated Press, f). In Chicago, when a skunk wandered into a resident's garage, neither the Animal Welfare organization, the city's stray pick-up service, the police, the city's rodent control department, or state game and wildlife officials would come and take the skunk away. Local health officials told the homeowner that it was illegal to keep the skunk, and it was illegal to let it go because it can carry rabies. State officials told the individual that it would be illegal to destroy the skunk. Finally in despair, the homeowner bought a wire trap and caught the skunk. He was then told that he had broken three laws; he had brought a trap into the city, it was illegal to trap in the city, and he had no license to trap in the state (Associated Press, g). In Dallas, Texas, a woman was fined for keeping 50 monkeys as pets. It was charged that "the monkeys create an offensive odor, excessive noise and cause severe devaluation of the property." (Asso- ciated Press, h). In Charleston, South Carolina, the city council enacted an ordinance to require horses to wear diapers, and charges were brought against a carriage driver who refused to diaper his horse. A municipal court judge declared the ordinance "unreasonable and invalid" (Associated Press, i). Anti-Cruelty to Animal Laws As noted earlier, there is a long history of organized groups and informal efforts to ameliorate the plight of the animal and to regulate the treatment of animals in order to protect them from human cruelty. Anti-cruelty stat- utes have both proliferated and expanded in their scope and coverage of animal-related human behavior. Contemporarily there are anti-cruelty laws covering animals in agriculture, being processed into meat, in enter- tainment, and in laboratory experimentation, to name but a few areas. Dog-fights and cockfighting are illegal in some contexts, in many states, but avidly pursued underground as clandestine sport by fans who are in violation of the law (Bryant). Showhorse "soring" is illegal under federal law but violations are endemic in some horse-show circles and circuits (Mizell and Robboy; Orgent). For many years, carnival geeks, who bite the</page><page sequence="18">416 / Social Forces / vol. 58:2, december 1979 heads off of chickens have often run afoul the law, and in one instance, a sheriff in a small southern town actually closed a geek show to prevent the star from performing the act he had advertised-eating a whole live pig (Bryant). A high school coach in Florida who acquired the curious practice of biting off the head of a frog during football games as a means of boosting the morale of his team, was ordered to cease the practice lest he be charged with violating animal-cruelty laws (Associated Press, j). Laws prohibiting a human from having sexual relations with an animal exist in most states and some carry very severe penalties. These laws generally view beastiality as cruelty to animals. (In recent years, the state of Indiana did away with its statute and other states may well follow). Crimes Against Ecology The concern with ecology in recent years has precipitated an elaborate extension of animal related laws and regulations. A significant propor- tion of such laws have addressed animals or fish that are threatened with extinction-"endangered species" as it were, and generally prohibited the hunting or killing of such animals if indigenous to this country, and the importation or ownership of the animals or any products derived from them, if the creatures are native to other countries. Examples of such laws are the prohibitions against importing certain types of furs, hides, and skins, as well as whale products and some kinds of ivory. The importation of certain rare kinds of birds and animals is also illegal but there is wide- spread smuggling of these creatures in spite of severe penalties. Inter- estingly, even noted scientists and zookeepers are violating such laws. The director of Yale University's Peabody Museum and an internationally known ornithologist and research pioneer in the study of egg-white protein, was fined $3,000 for illegally importing bird eggs from Britain (New York Times News Service). In recent years some of the most prestigious zoos in the nation have been investigated for possible violation of federal laws concerning the importation of rare animals (Associated Press, k). Rare parrots and other birds have become so valuable that widespread criminal activities involving smuggling birds into the country in order to evade animal protection laws are occurring. Some parrots or parakeets may be worth as much as $10,000 each, and smugglers sometimes try to bring in illegal shipments of birds worth as much as half-a-million dollars (Asso- ciated Press, 1). In the well-publicized snail-darter case, a 100 million dollar dam had to be halted because its completion and the subsequent impact on a hitherto unidentified species of perch fish would have violated the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Crime is a behavioral phenomenon relative to time and technology, and to social values and interpretive context. It would appear that such laws and patterns of social control attendant to animals and animal related human behavior are proliferating at a significant rate, and will continue to</page><page sequence="19">Zoological Connection I 417 do so in the future. In the face of social constraints to the contrary, violations of such normative systems will also likely persist, if not accel- erate, producing much more widespread modal patterns of "zoological crime." There would seem to be little rationalization for sociologists to continue to disregard animal crime. Such criminal configurations may have far more significant social consequences than might be generally believed. Smuggled parrots might carry Newcastle's disease which could precipitate epidemics and heavy losses in the poultry business, making the price of chickens and eggs skyrocket. Animal crime is ubiquitous. It is encountered in city and farm, factory and laboratory and its offenders come from all walks of life and social classes. Animal crime involves powerful public sentiments from all concerned parties. Animal crime with all of its implications may be as potentially divisive and as disruptive to the social enterprise as any other form of deviancy. Summary Our social enterprise is not composed of humans alone. Creatures of all variety are inextricably involved in many of our behavioral activities and play important interactive roles in society. The animal influence in our lives is enormous and our culture is richly infused with zoological components. The profusion of animal oriented or related human behavior in which we routinely engage is important in its consequences and significant in its import. It would seem to well justify the research attention of sociologists. As students of society and social behavior, we can no more appropriately ignore the zoological dimension, than an analysis of drama can ignore seminal actors in a play. To truly understand human social behavior in all its vagaries, and to be completely sensitive to the full array of its nuisances and subtleties, we must enhance our appreciation of its zoological dimen- sion. Accordingly, we might all be well advised to add animals to the lexicon of our discipline. We may come to perceive whole new vistas of behavioral linkages by taking into account the "zoological connection." Our behavior, our lives and our destiny are directed in part by the shadow of the beast. Let us, therefore, turn our sociological attention to this neglected area of social causation. Notes 1. We refer to sensitizing in a manner similar to that of Blumer in his use of the phrase "sensitizing concepts." 2. There has been a recent and excellent sociological study of the rodeo (Reid). 3. Perhaps one of the most singular instances of becoming newsworthy because of involve- ment with animals is the case of Peter Snyman. Mr. Snyman is a South African who has been attempting to break the world record for living in a snake pit. He has been living in a cage with 24 poisonous snakes including black mambas and Egyptian cobras and hopes to continue</page><page sequence="20">418 / Social Forces ! vol. 58:2, december 1979 his ordeal for 40 days to break the old record of 36 days. The snakes sometimes slither into bed with Mr. Snyman for a little body warmth. (Associated Press, a). Another odd, animal-related record was set by Curtis Roe of Bakersfield, California who reportedly ate 32 earthworms and set a record in doing so. As a prize he won a role in an upcoming movie to be titled "Brain Suckers." (Associated Press, b). 4. Many colleagues in sociological circles have told me of a paper which Hugh Bain read at a professional meeting some years ago. The paper addressed the topic of the dog as a social problem. Unfortunately, I have never been successful in locating a copy of this paper. If anyone has this paper, I would very much appreciate receiving a copy. 5. One such effort is the program of research studies conducted at VPI &amp; SU over the past six years. This research has addressed the occupational structure, role, and careers of ecologically related vocations, most of which are, incidentally, also animal related. Among the occupations studied are those of veterinarian, game warden, forest and park ranger, fish biologist, marine resources agent, and poultry processing worker. For an overview of this research program see Bryant et al. 6. Skinner, of course, had managed to train pigeons to operate missile guidance systems in World War II. 7. Only recently have social thanatologists begun to explore the parameters of grief and mourning attendant to the death of companion animals. For one excellent, pioneering study see the paper by Witt. 8. The emotional dependence of humans on animals has been noted by both folk peoples and contemporary romantic novelists. As one American Indian expressed it: What is man without beasts? If all the beasts were gone, men would die from great loneliness of spirit, for whatever happens to the beast also happens to man. All things are connected. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of earth. Chief Sealth of the Duwamish Tribe, State of Washington, Letter to the President of the United States, 1855 (quoted in Rynearson) In a similar vein Romain Gary, the French novelist, has the protagonist Morel, in the Roots of Heaven say: 'Dogs aren't enough any more,' he was saying, with satisfaction. 'You see, up to now, dogs were enough for a good many people. They consoled themselves in their company. But the way things have been going, people have been seized by such a need for friendship and company that the dogs can't manage it. We've been asking too much of them. The job has broken them down-they've had it. Just think how long they've been doing their damnedest for us, wagging their tails and holding out their paws-they've had enough. . . ' 'They've had enough, I tell you. It's natural: they've seen too much. And the people feel lonely and deserted, and they need something bigger that can really take the strain. Dogs aren't enough any more; men need elephants. That's the way I see it.' 9. It is interesting to note that recently dogs are being used in therapy programs for alcoholics. As one alcoholic patient put it, "A dog is always your friend" (United Press International, a). 10. The phrase, "Son of Sam murders," became a household word. We have traditionally tended to use animal labels in referring to some kinds of crime and criminals. Examples might include "cat burglar," "mad-dog killer," and "werewolf killings."
