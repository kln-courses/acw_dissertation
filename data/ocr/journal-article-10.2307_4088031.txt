College Station, Texas A&amp;M University Press. xix + 225 pp., 45 illustrations. ISBN 0-89096-378-9. NPG.-The au- thor of this delightful book gives an absorbing ac- count of the life of "Florence," as she calls Mrs. Bailey. From 1885 throughout her long life, Florence Bailey pioneered field study of birds, fought for their con- servation, wrote of her explorations of the West with her husband, Vernon Bailey, and devoted boundless energy to educating the public, especially children, about birds. Florence was the first woman elected a Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union. In the same year, she was awarded the Brewster Medal for her "Birds of New Mexico," published in 1928. Her chronicles of explorations of then little-known parts of North America illustrate the role, in protection of wildlife, of such naturalists as C. Hart Merriam (her brother), John Muir, John Burroughs, Ernest Thompson Seton, and the botanist Alice Eastwood. Conservationists will learn how the struggles to educate the public brought about legislation we now take for granted. Kofalk relegates to the back of the book explanatory notes for each chapter, a complete bibliography of Florence's writings, secondary sources including mention of Mrs. Bailey by other authors, and a de- tailed index. The delightful story of Florence's life thus unfolds smoothly in the text, uncluttered by doc- umentation. The book is filled with quotations from Florence's publications. She was a good scientist, who combined rigorous observations of wild birds with highly sub- jective interpretations. Some ornithologists may find her anthropomorphic statements and flowery style irritating. However, I found the style refreshing. The main thrust of Kofalk's message is clear. In the Introduction she expresses appreciation of Florence and all she stood for: "By viewing nature through Florence's eyes we can [experience] both intuitive love for the wholeness of nature and a scientific knowl- edge of its intricate workings." And "perhaps both poet and scientist can once again share their experi- ences in nature for the benefit of those who seek its joy as well as its definition." Amen! This biography is essential for museum and com- munity libraries that emphasize field biology and conservation, for ornithologists-both professional and amateur-and for anyone who enjoys a true story, beautifully told.-BARBAR B.
