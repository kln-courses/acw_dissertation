<plain_text><page sequence="1">EBIONITE CHRISTIANITY [In the jf.T.S. of April 1951, pp. 96-99, Professor T. W. Manson re viewed two books by Professor H. J. Schoeps, dealing with Jewish Christianity. The latter was so good as to send to the Editor recently a summary of the results of his studies in this subject, and by Dr. Man son's advice this summary, apart from a few omissions, is here offered to the reader. Dr. Manson believes that there is fruitful work to be done in this field of inquiry, which has been much neglected in the past; and he hopes that this summary may stimulate interest in the subject. The translation is by the Editor.] Definite authorities, the pseudo-Clementine Romance (consisting of Homilies and Recognitions), Symmachus' translation of the Bible, re mains of apocryphal gospels, patristic and rabbinic information, disclose to us the theology of Jewish-Christian communities of the middle and later part of the second century. Jewish Christianity obviously took many forms and varied in different districts. But the sources just men tioned are attached, almost without exception, to groups in Coele-Syria or Transjordan, composed of the descendants of the first Christians who left Jerusalem and probably also of others who moved from Palestine shortly before a.d. 70 and round a.d. 135. In this way information and traditions have been preserved, which go back to the middle of the first century and reveal the opposition of their fathers at Jerusalem to St. Paul and the growing Gentile Christian church. This opposition, mirrored in the oldest strata of the pseudo-Clementine Romance, had practical im portance for these groups, because their fathers' arguments could also be applied for their own defence against Marcion and the Christian 'gnosis'. It is proposed in the following pages to sketch briefly their tenets in respect of their Christology, their opposition to St. Paul, and their attitude to the Jewish law, so far as the positive and negative evi dence permits. 1. 1. The Ebionite Picture of Jesus Christ In Jesus the Ebionites saw the teacher and the pattern of perfect 'Chassiduth'. On account of the merit of his life, they held, he was called</page><page sequence="2">220 NOTES AND STUDIES by God to be the Christ, that is, the messianic Prophet. 'Had another similarly fulfilled the precepts of the law, he would similarly have be come the Christ, for in virtue of like deeds others also can become a Christ', says Hippolytus (Philos. vii. 34, 1 f.) with regard to their belief. The Ebionites saw in Jesus the saddiq, who in a unique degree perfectly fulfilled the law. In their view, however, he fulfilled it as a human being, not as Son of God, but as Son of man, who was consecrated to be Messiah and equipped by God with power, not through true pre-exis tence or at the moment of birth, but only on the day of his baptism through the act, announced in the words of Ps. 27, of adoption through baptism, i.e. through the Holy Spirit present in the baptismal water. Among the Ebionites this 'adoptionist Christology' was combined with the apocalyptic expectation of the Son of man which prevailed in the primitive community, the expectation that 'Rabbi Jeshu ha-Nozri', transfigured into the angelic form of the Son of man on the clouds of heaven, would soon return at the hour of salvation for the last judgement upon the living and the dead. The disappointment of this expectation, the fact of the delay of the 'parousia', is to blame for the result that the fading of the strong eschatological interest in the fourth and fifth cen turies led to the end of the Ebionite movement. The delay of the 'parou sia', it is true, promoted the development of the Catholic church; but in face of this hard fact the growth of the primitive Jerusalem community could not continue, since the latter held fast to a primitive stage of Christology, that is to say, the expectation of the 'parousia' of the Son of man. Apart from this expectation, however, the Ebionite picture of Jesus was also characterized by a quite different feature, the belief that he was the messianic prophet, the true prophet promised by Moses. Such a prophet had been widely expected in Judaism at the beginning of the Christian era, and the messianic doctrine, that the true prophet had come in Jesus, is a feature of the primitive community. This doctrine links the primitive community with the Jewish Christianity of Epiphanius and the pseudo-Clementines, and also distinguishes it markedly and definitely from those Jews whose messianic hopes were entirely directed to the remoter future. The Ebionite belief, that Jesus was 'the true prophet', that is to say, the messianic prophet promised by Moses, whom God would raise up 'like unto me' (Deut. 18'5), led among them to a complete parallelism of the two personalities. Both were sent by God to make covenants with mankind. As Moses was steward of the Jews (Luke 124*), so was Jesus steward for the Gentiles (Horn. 2, 52). But since the teaching of both is the same, God accepts every man who believes one of them (Horn. 8, 6).</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND STUDIES 221 Thus for the Ebionites conversion to Christ and conversion to the holy God and to the Jewish law (Horn. 4, 22) are one and the same. 2. The Ebionite Opposition to St. Paul On the basis of this position the Ebionites were bound, as a matter of principle, to adopt a position of hostility to the teaching of the apostle Paul and to the man himself. No direct evidence of teaching against the Pauline theology has been preserved in the sources which have survived to us, but instead we find an all the more violent polemic against his apostleship, its purpose being to discredit him as a deceiver (2 Cor. 68), as an enemy (Gal. 416), indeed as the Evil One himself (2 Thess. 24), who has given heresy a footing in the church of Christ. His teachings they disparage as 'the false gospel'. The Ebionites who figure in Ps.-Clement in this matter merely renew once more the accusations of their fathers, the Judaizers in the Pauline missionary churches, and thus make their fathers' standpoint for the first time quite clear. In particular we can perceive from the passage Horn. 17, 13-20, that the Ebionites and their forerunners condemned St. Paul's appeal to a vision of the risen Lord as a demonic illusion. His apostleship, based on 'visions and revelations,' they held to be illegitimate, since apostleship was only legitimized by personal intercourse with the earthly Jesus. It is clear that from the outset the circle of the twelve (together with James) and the Jerusalem Christians regarded the status of an eyewitness of the Elect One, that is, physical companionship with him, as essential for the rank of an apostle and the office of teaching, and conceded to St. Paul at most the function of 'a worker together with us', as the Clementine Peter (Horn. 17, 20) expresses it. We may compare Rec. 2, 55: 'he who does not learn the law from teachers, but regards himself as a teacher and rejects the instruction of the disciples of Jesus, must necessarily fall into absurdities with regard to God'. Indeed Peter in this connexion expresses the further opinion that Saul-Paul had indeed a vision which came from Jesus, but that it was of the kind which Jesus in anger would allow to an enemy (Horn. 17, 14). Hence St. Paul's thought is said to be the opposite of the teaching of Jesus (17, 18). These polemics, which we only possess in truncated form, probably derive from ancient ebionitic Acts of the Apostles giving a very malicious presentation of the anti-christian activity of St. Paul previous to the martyrdom of St. Stephen, of his conversion, and of the events in Antioch. On this view, as 'the enemy' in his Jewish period contended for a Mosaism whose moral and spiritual truth had been sacrificed to ritual requirements, so he later became opposed to ·the whole Mosaic law. Having by his interference already frustrated the efforts of the primitive</page><page sequence="4">222 NOTES AND STUDIES community and of James for the conversion of the Jews to the Mosaic law reformed by the prophet Jesus, after his conversion he still remained the persecutor of the true law. 3. The Ebionite Understanding of the Law The Ebionites of the second and third century were, like their fathers, the 'certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed' (Acts 155), plain and professed 'enthusiasts for the law' (Acts 2120). They call their teach ing 'the proclamation of the law', but carried the Mosaic law to new extremes of strictness by their insistence, as a matter of principle, on vegetarianism (which was to overcome the imperfections of the Jewish 'schechitha'), by the command of poverty and community of goods, as well as by a vigorous system of purifications, extending from ritual washings to a singular water-mysticism culminating in the act of baptism. But, while on one side they increased the severity of the law, they also took a decisive and historically very important line in carrying through a systematic revision of the Mosaic law; that is to say, they cut out the sanguinary cult of animal sacrifice, after that, the institution of the kingship in Israel, then the erroneous—that is to say, the unfulfilled —prophecies of scripture, as well as, lastly, the divine utterances of an anthropomorphic character, as being 'erroneous sections', which had been subsequently inserted into the Mosaic torah. Jesus was for them the reformer of the Jewish law, whose teaching was the criticism of the torah as a means of spreading the knowledge what in the law is truth, and what is error, wrongly introduced. In Ebionite belief, therefore, the reformation of the law by Jesus was connected above all with the sacrificial cult, and in connexion with such an estimate of Jesus' opposition to the sanguinary sacrificial cult of atonement we see a further reason why the Ebionites were bound to reject the Pauline teaching. For St. Paul's soteriological estimate of the death of Jesus as an atoning sacrifice is—ebionitically speaking—the greatest paradox which can be conceived, a blasphemy so great that it alone at once proves him to be a type of the false prophet. Not by the all-encompassing sacrifice of the Son of God, as the church, following St. Paul, teaches, did Christianity become free from the Jewish sacrificial worship, but Jesus by the waters of baptism extinguished the fire of sacrifice—such is Ebionite belief. In any case, in the Ebionite theology Jesus' specific task was the abolition of sacrifice; and thereby he proved himself the 'true prophet', precisely because, alongside complete alle giance to and affirmation of the Mosaic law in all other respects, he brought to an end the sacrificial torah. All the Ebionite deductions from and additions to the law, commanded</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND STUDIES 223 by Jesus, the alleviations as well as the increased burdens, have, how ever, as their sole purpose the expression of the will of God as the authority behind the scriptures, in order to set up once more the broken unity between the law and the will of God. In the last resort they assessed the law by reference to Jesus; in his life and in his teaching they saw the correct fulfilment of the Mosaic law. That which in it was of God he confirmed; that which was not of God he abolished. For them Ebionite theology simply meant the establishment of this in detail. In opposition to the Pauline teaching their purpose in this connexion was, as the con tent of the true worship of God, to revere him only, not to live a defiled life, to do good, not to commit injustice (Horn. 7, 8). Through 'righteous ness by means of works' (justitia in operibus, Rec. 2, 36) the 'higher righteousness' required by Jesus, the true Prophet, would be attained. 4. The Ebionites' Place in History Especially surprising is the hostility of the Ebionites to the Jewish sacrificial cultus, a hostility which was also directed against the cult places of the Jerusalem temple, on the ground that the temple was a debased form of the old tabernacle of God's choice. Since in Jewish religious history, from the nomadic Rechabites through the Maccabean era to the Essenes of the period before and after Christ, movements continually occurred which were opposed to the sacrificial cultus of the Jerusalem priesthood, it is possible to place the Ebionites in a clearly definable context in the history of ideas, especially as their inner con nexion with the Essenes seems close. Obviously in their line of descent are especially also those groups that are represented by the writings, which have become known, since my books were completed, through the discovery of the scrolls from 'Ain Feshkha. A comparison of their views, together with several characteristic agreements in detail, at least yields a very similar Christology (more sedeq: 'the true prophet'), the same glorification of the poor and probably also (Sektenkanon ix. 3) a common attitude of reserve towards the sanguinary sacrificial cultus. As I was able to show elsewhere,1 the Zadokite group of 'Ain Feshkha, the church of Damascus, Essenes, and Ebionites probably had a doc trinal connexion. This was rendered possible by the exodus of the primi tive community to Transjordan, where from of old time Jewish minority groups opposed to civilization and the cultus had settled. That the Ebionites of patristic literature and the Clementine Romance are in fact the physical descendants of the original Jerusalem community, also follows—apart from the testimony of Eusebius and Epiphanius— 1 Η. J. Schoeps, 'Handelt es sich wirklich um ebionitische Dokumente?' Zeitschrift fiir Religions- und Geistesgeschichte, 1951, Heft 4.</page><page sequence="6">224 NOTES AND STUDIES from two explanatory statements of the Ebionite source of the pseudo Clementine Romance (Rec. 1, 37 syr.; Rec. 1, 39), which hitherto have been for the most part overlooked: 'The wisdom of God transported them, for their deliverance, to a safe place in the country, and this before the outbreak of the war, which was to result in the destruction of the unbelieving Jews.' The descendants of the primitive Jerusalem community were able to maintain themselves in their new homes, remote from the highways of the world, hardly more than 350 years. In accordance with the usual fate of sectaries, they seem latterly to have broken apart or at least to have branched out in many diverging lines. So far as they did not find their way back to the Catholic church, they were finally submerged in the motley mixture of religions in the Near East, after their watchwords and their programme for the reform of the Jewish law had met with no approval on any side, and the strength of their eschatological expectation had been gradually broken by the fact of the delay in the 'parousia', since this was not compensated, as it was in the great church, by any special sacra mental mysticism. So far, however, as their religious teaching and doc trinal formulations are concerned, these, more or less modified and recast, again came to the light of day—along several lines of connexion— in the third, and up to the present time last revealed, religion in world history, Islam.
