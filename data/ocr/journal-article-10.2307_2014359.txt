Hertz Philosophical Lecture, 29th November, 1922. JAMES WARD. Published for the British Aca- demy. New York: Oxford University Press, American Branch. Pp. 22. Professor Ward has disarmed criticism of his " study " by his frank avowal that it is but " a selection from notes made as a pre- liminary to something more systematic," having decided to publish them (" not without misgiving," he confesses) in the hope that they may aid students of Kant younger than himself. Such a modest self-appraisal of a difficult undertaking must silence effectually any attempt to cavil at the author for not having accomplished a more elaborate task. Yet if these " notes," comprehending within their scope almost the entire compass of Kant's philosophy, so vividly illu- mine points in it that are notoriously obscure and crucial, what, it is impossible not to ask, would not a detailed and systematic work on Kant, rivaling perhaps that of Professor Norman Kemp Smith, have achieved for us? But we must be grateful for what a scholar so eminent and so erudite has chosen to give, albeit the unhappy word " suggestive " is the word that fittingly describes Professor Ward's manifold comments upon Kant's philosophy. Yet it is precisely the profundity of these comments which must cause all readers to regret their want of fullness, of length, and of systematic connection. Though fragmentary and suggestive, these notes are closely packed with solid information and subtle criticism. The wealth of topics covered within the limits of so few pages is truly remarkable. There is hardly a phase of Kant's philosophy upon which Professor Ward has not shed the light of his learning. Kant's early development, his pre-critical period, the transition from the Dissertation to the first Critique, the cardinal principles of Kant's theory of knowledge, the interpretation of his system as philosophical anthropomorphism, an analysis and appraisal of such anthropomorphism in relation to all the three Critiques, a detailed discussion and criticism of Kant's doc- trine of the " inner sense," a critical account of the esthetic and bio- logical judgments contained in the third Critique, Kant's relation to the logic and the psychology of his age-these are some of the topics upon which both in the Study and in the Hertz Lecture Professor Ward has brought to bear his ripe scholarship, his sustained reflec- tion, his discerning judgment. It is difficult to single out for particular comment any one of these different themes. One important idea, however, by which Professor</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 433 Ward sets very much store, deserves more than passing mention. It has to do with Professor Ward's view of Kant's philosophy as a new sort of anthropomorphism. The imma-nent metaphysics of Kant is a transcendental ideali,sm in the sense that its central source and mean- ing must be derived from the " activity of the expirient subject it- self." It is this which led Kant to regard the " critical " revolu- tion in philosophy as comparable with the Copernican revolution in astronomy. Just as Copernicus had substituted a heliocentrie for a geocentric description of celestial movements, so Kant claimed to have revolutionized the epistemological problem by substituting the knowing subject as the law-giver to nature in place of things per se, the knowledge of which transcendent metaphysics (as distinguished from immanent metaphysics) vainly seeks to demonstrate. " We as- sume," Professor Ward quotes from the preface to the second edition of the Critique, " that we know a priori of things only what we our- selves put into them." Upon such a Copernican revolution in epis- temology Professor Ward makes the comment that " the simple de- scription which Copernicus advocated exalted the universe and humbled the earth: the bold paradox . . . which Kant nevertheless attempted to uphold-exalted the knowing subject and banished be- yond the limits of knowledge the whole universe of things per se " (Study, pp. 60-61). To Professor Ward " an immanent metaphys- ics, limited to the prejection on to the object of attributes pertain- ing to the Subject-more exactly, the interpretation of the World in terms of the Self-is just anthropomorphism " (Hertz Lecture, p. 14). The source of the real and constitutive categories not being, in Profes- sor Ward's striking word, " logomorphic," as Kant himself fre- quently supposed, but rather " anthropomorphic," their origin not being a logical form, but a subjective " analogy," Kant's philosophy, according to Professor Ward, turns out to have a significance far deeper than any that Kant himself allowed; for the anthropomorphic vein running through his philosophy, the ineluctable tendency to in- terpret the world in terms of ourselves, means nothing less than the necessity " to orientate the natural by reference to the spiritual" (Study, p. 131). Kant 's system, so Professor Ward holds, is a philosophical anthro- pomorphic one, based upon " the centrality of the appercipient self," and as such is a deeply spiritual philosophy of whose central thesis Kant was but dimly conscious, and to which he never remained thor- oughly steadfast. It is the Kantian form of anthropomorphism which guarantees the spiritual structure and function of experience, despite the fact, as Professor Ward is constrained to admit, that an- thropomorphism is an unfortunate term, "apt to suggest myths and graven images, fictions which at the best only travesty and mask the</page><page sequence="3">434 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPIIY truth " (Study, p. 136.) Though anthropomorphism is not the best term to bring out the significance for knowledge of the central prin- ciple of the appercipient self, the thesis which the term suggests is the golden thread that runs through the labyrinth of Kant's system, as exemplified not only by the Critique, of Pure Reason but by the other two Critiqttes as well. To quote Professor Ward: " In pass- ing from the categories of the understanding to what he called the Ideas of the reason, we find Kant is avowedly anthropomorphic. These Ideas correspond to the three divisions of the Wolffian ontology, known as rational psychology, rational cosmology, and rational the- ology. An anthropomorphic interpretation of the Self would be meaningless tautology. In the case of the World which confronts us as an interacting plurality, the only anthropomorphism possible is to interpret that plurality, as consisting of experiments, i.e., of objects which are also ' ejects '-to employ a useful term that has at last found its way into our language. And this is just what the primitive mind does. To this primitive ejectification or personification Leib- nitz's monadology is clearly akin; and this doctrine Kant shared, as a ' private opinion,' at all events, throughout his many Umkippun- gen, and in the end he openly espoused it. As to his Idea of God- this was as anthropomorphic as it is possible to be in view of our finitude and the Supreme Being's infinite perfection. In other words, God for him was what Lotze called a perfect person; this per- fection being for us a pure Ideal, altogether surpassing all the limita- tions of finite beings " (Hertz Lecture, p. 15). And when " we turn to reason on its practical side, and this for Kant was its primary side, we find ourselves in possession of new categories concerning what ought to be, and these yield a new clue to what is. Here the mere Idea of theoretical reason becomes for practical reason a reality which it must postulate if the moral order of the world is to stand. But a postulate essential to the realization of what we ought to be, yet based not on what we know but on what we are, is surely nothing if it is not anthropomorphic, that is to say, analogical in the sense of Kant's theoretical ideal. So much then for the avowed anthropo- morphism of Kant's first two Critiques " (Study, pp. 93-94). Of the last Critique, because " the more important in respect to the anthropomorphic tenor of Kant's philosophy, " Professor Ward gives a detailed and subtle ac-count-this portion of the text being per- haps his most important and original contribution-fully illustrat- ing how a critique of judgment gives us a clue which reason every- where directs us to follow, the clue, namely, to interpret the world in terms of ourselves, to orientate in anthropomorphic fashion the natural from the standpoint of the spiritual.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 435 There is no doubt that the interpretation of Kant's system as philosophic anthropomorphism enables Professor Ward to connect by a continuous thread the three great Critiques and to gain a synop- tic view from which to discern what, according to his own metaphysi- cal convictions, is vital and enduring in Kant's philosophy and what is not. But it is a pity that this subjectivistic account of Kant, in support of which Professor Ward can invoke with great acumen a plenitude of authoritative statements culled from authentic texts, is not fully contrasted with accounts totally at variance with it; it is a pity, in short, that Professor Ward has not worked out his theory with the same scrupulous attention to Kantian utterances equally authoritative, but defying the consistency of any single interpreta- tion as, for instance, Professor Norman Kemp Smith has done in his massive Comm.entary, where an altogether different view of Kant is upheld. And speaking of this Commentary, it is regrettable that, save for a few casual references, Professor Ward has made so little use of it. For in his great work Professor Kemp Smith has assem- bled very strong evidence for views which in many ways are diamet- rically opposed to those entertained by Professor Ward. One won- ders why Professor Ward has chosen to ignore evidence so important and so impressive. But, at any rate, without directly challenging any interpretation opposed to his own, Professor Ward has shown that an anthropomorphic or subjectivistic account of Kant's philoso- plhy is not untenable, thereby proving, if one may be pardoned for facetiousness, that Kant's well-known prediction that a hundred years would be required to understand him may have been perhaps too sanguine.
