<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRIEF NOTICES EVOLUTION THOUGHTS ON EVOLUTION. III. Evolution and the Primitive. Anthropological Series of the Boston College Graduate School, Vol. IV, No. 3. By Joseph J. Williams, S.J. Boston Col- lege Press, Chestnut Hill, Mass. $i.oo. 92 x 62; 64; I939 (paper). In this study the author considers evolu- tionary theories which have been proposed on the origin of man and the origin of monotheistic religion as related to the dim past of Homo sapiens. He sets forth the theories of well-known scientists and calls attention to the many contradictory rea- sonings contained therein. The author's object is to determine whether a careful analysis of the facts col lected show that there has been within historic times an evolutionary influence or a decadent one, directing the affairs, religious and otherwise, of the so-called Primitives of Africa, and in consequence to establish whether the theories built up by Evolutionists on their present culture are founded on objective evidence or solely on subjective preconceptions. A second article is a pictorial and word description of the flint artifacts of the L'Abri Bergy site, of which a general description was given in the April issue of the Anthropological Series. LEAVES AND STEMS FROM FOSSIL FORESTS. A Handbook of the Paleobotanical Collections in the Illinois State Museum. Popular Sci- ence Series Vol. 1. By Raymond E. Janssen. Illinois State Museum, Springfield, Ill. $i .25. 94 x 64; I90; I939 (paper). This beautifully illustrated report is based mainly on the fine Langford collections of fossils taken from the Mazon Creek coal region of Illinois-although these same forms are to be found elsewhere in the state. Something over I5O genera and species are described and illustrated (I64 figures, mostly photographic reproduc- tions). The i6 different coal seams to be found in Illinois indicate that for i6 con- secutive times the water rose and destroyed and buried the luxurious tropical vegeta- tion which covered this region. The preservation of the remains is such that, in the shale beds immediately above or below the coal seams, complete leaves with their intricate veins, surface hairs and texture, and individual plant cells can be studied. A bibliography and index complete the report.</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS GENETICS THE GENETIC BASIS FOR DEMOCRACY. A Panel Discussion on Race and Race Prejudice. Held at the Little Theatre, Hall of Science and Education, New York World's Fair, Octo- ber I4, I939. By Henry A. Wallace, Franz, Boas, Hadley Cantril and William A. Hamm. American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom, 519 West I2I St., New York. 40 cents. ii x 82; 2.5; I939 (paper). The average person who dislikes foreigners or racial groups other than his own is likely to think that he does so because they are inferior in some way. But the fact is that more often than not such a person has got the cart before the horse. The fact that he dislikes them is the cause for his thinking them to be inferior. It is a simple matter for the geneticist to show that there is little or no scientific basis for theories of racial inferiority, but that is not enough. The old poem about Dr. Fell carries more weight with the "morally illiterate" (this apt phrase is quoted from Mr. Hamm's contribution to this panel discussion) than all the conclusions of the scientists. Of the four contributions to this sym- posium, three are exclusively diagnostic. Only one, that of Cantril, is prescriptive. He mentions by name several subversive organizations (the list might easily be made more comprehensive) whose methods and sources of propaganda might be inves- tigated to advantage. He also warns of the flood of anti-alien (and therefore un- American in spirit) legislation that will undoubtedly try to force its way through Congress if that body should exercise its prerogative of declaring war, and suggests preparations to oppose it. Twenty-three years ago there was only one organization in the United States con- cerned directly with the preservation of intellectual freedom. That there are so many more today is a sign of hope and a cause for thanksgiving. PARTNER OF NATURE. By Luther Burbank. Edited and tran- scribed bv Wilbur Hall. D. Appleton- Century Co., New York and London. $3.00. 8 x 2; xi + 3I5 + 23 plates; I939. The life of Luther Burbank, both as a man and as a naturalist, should be an inspira- tion to everyone who has the slightest interest in the wonders of the plant world about him. This thoroughly enjoyable volume is essentially an autobiography, though the material has been compiled and edited since Mr. Burbank's death, and it deals only with his work-but then his work was really his life. Burbank admit- ted quite frankly that he had no literary talents, but he has succeeded in putting down clearly, forcefully, and in a delight- fully readable and interesting fashion, the results of his long and rich life of work in practical plant breeding, propagation and experimentation. The underlying theme of his great work, and the note that he stressed again and again, was patience. To this he added the single factor of repetition. The clue to his success in producing new fruits, vegetables and flowers, and improv- ing our old ones is explained in Burbank's ability to learn what nature has to teach, and to use that knowledge in directing and speeding up the natural processes by which plant evolution has taken place. The value of his work can probably never be estimated in terms of dollars and cents. His improvements on the potato alone have resulted in an estimated increase in value of more than a billion dollars in the past fifty years! The volume is not intended for the pro- fessional botanist but for the practical and amateur plant breeder, the nurseryman, and the back-lot gardener. The text is richly illustrated, and carefully indexed. PRACTICAL PLANT BREEDING. Second Edition. By W. J. C. Lawrence. With a Foreword by Sir Daniel Hall. George Allen and Unwin, London; De La Mare Garden Books, New York. ss. 6d. net. 7 3 X '55; I939. Mr. Lawrence's experience as director of the gardens of John Innes Horticultural Institution has well qualified him for the</page><page sequence="3">2Z26 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY task of writing this book on practical plant breeding. The separate enterprises of botany, genetics, and plant propagation have been adequately discusse in separate volumes, but the three have probably never before been so well synthesized for the purpose of laying the foundation for a study of plant breeding, as has been done in this volume. The range of material includes discus- sions on the structure of plants and flow- ers, the techniques of cross-pollination, the laws of heredity, and the general meth- ods of improving plants. The volume is simply written, free from technical termi- nology and textbook procedures. The numerous drawings, diagrams, and photo- graphs will undoubtedly enhance the value of the book as a guide in the hands of the amateur gardener or nurseryman. An index and a selected list of books on plant breeding conclude the volume. POPULATION, RACE AND EUGENICS. By Morris Siegel. Published by the Author, 546 Barton St., Hamilton, Ontario. $3.00. 72 X 5; x + 2.o6; I939. Dr. Siegel divides his book into two parts -positive eugenics and restrictive eugen- ics. In the first he discusses population and eugenics and the probable etiology of differential fertility and makes recom- mendations for improving the situation. Much is said concerning racial theories in relation to eugenics and every effort made to deflate the claims of those who cham- pion "Nordic superiority." There is a very helpful chapter on rational marriage from the eugenic point of view. In the second part of the book, the various men- tal aberrations of eugenic significance are discussed and restrictive measures pro- posed. There are bibliographies appended to each chapter and a good index is provided. BIBLIOGRAPHY ON THE GENETICS OF DROSOPHILA. By H. J. Muller. Oliver and Boyd, Edin- burgh. 5s. 94 x 74; 132.; I939 (paper). Students of the genetics and physiology of Drosophila will find this a highly useful publication. In addition to articles on this insect, the bibliography includes a few works which, although dealing with other forms, concern problems intimately connected with the field of genetic re- search. The material is presented alpha- betically by authors and co-authors. Muller believed it inadvisable to provide a subject classification in view of the con- siderable amount of overlapping which this would necessitate. Titles in Eastern European languages have been translated into English and the original language indicated. Notes also appear which indi- cate summaries in languages other than that used in the body of the article. A number of abstracts, dissertations, and unpublished manuscripts are listed among the almost 3000 titles presented. GENERAL BIOLOGY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: Showing the Operations, Expenditures, and Conditioz of the Institution for the Year Ended June 30, I938. Publication 3491. Smithsonian Institution. U. S. Govern- ment Printing Office, Washington. $i.5o. X 51; xiii + 6o8 + II plates; I939. To the summary of the year's activities of the various branches of the Institution there is added, as usual, a general appendix containing papers (32 in the present vol- ume) on a wide variety of subjects, but all of interest to the general reader. The writers, in each case, are dealing with their own special subjects in which they are authorities, hence write clearly and accurately. It is only possible, in so limited a space, to give briefly some of the topics presented: P. G. H. Boswell writes of The floor of the ocean; H. T. Stetson, The sun and the atmosphere; H. E. Wim- peris, The natural limits to human flight; etc. Coming to the purely biological papers-in Eyes that shine at night, by E. P. Walker, we read that the cat is not alone in the shining of its eyes by reflected light. There are toads, of the genus Bufo, and the caiman (tropical American alli- gator) "whose eyes give perhaps the most</page><page sequence="4">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS )27 pronounced and beautiful glow I have ever observed." The eyes of most domesti- cated and some wild animals deteriorate in their reflecting ability in captivity. In some animals the color of the "shine" is constant, in others it may appear as three different colors within a few seconds. The paper on The black widow spider (re- printed from The Quarterly Review of Biology, vol. ii, No. X, June I936), by D'Amour, Becker and Van Riper, gives a great deal of information about this timid but much-feared insect. K. von Frisch, in writing on The language of bees, tells of training bees to color and to scent. Train- ing to taste is impossible, "Either they [the bees] drink the solution or they refuse it." But the bees "have something like a language" and von Frisch reports some of the results of his many experiments along this line. We regret that there is not space to include some of the interesting facts brought out in such discussions as Forest genetics, The story of the maiden- hair tree, "Root-pressure" -an unappre- ciated force in sap movement, the Folsom problem in American archeology, and others. Illustrations, maps and bibliog- raphies frequently accompany the texts. KOONWARRA. A Naturalist's Adventures in Australiaz. By Charles Barrett. Oxford University Press, New York and London. $3.00. 8 x 52; xii + 3I5 + 49 plates; I939. The author of Koonwarra is a naturalist and traveler by choice, a newspaperman by profession. The name Koonwarra, mean- ing black swan, was chosen for the title of this book describing life on the smallest of all continents, because it has both his- torical and scientific significance. In I697 William de Vlaming, a Dutch navigator, caused a furore in Europe by returning from the west coast of Australia with four swans which amazingly enough had plum- age of black. The author is most adept at spinning a yarn, and this book, which one could really call an autobiography, is full of amusing anecdotes. Not to mention beach-combers, blackfellows, bushmen, and sundry traveling acquaintances, Mr. Barrett's family, friends, fellow scientists, and even two old maid neighbors play their r6les in this entertaining book. The author has covered a great deal of Australian territory in his search for interesting plants, animals, birds, and insects. He describes his many journeys and what he has seen on his wanderings in Queensland, central, southern, north- ern, and north-western Australia, through the Bass Strait and its many islands, through the Gulf of Carpentaria and its islands, on Erye's Peninsula, in Tasmania, on the islands of the Great Barrier Reef, up and down inland rivers and lakes too numerous to mention. The reader is told of the habits, habitats, and geo- graphical distribution of such varied creatures as the giant earthworm, spiny anteater, platypus, koala, bull-ant, cuccus, crocodile, wombat, tree kangeroo, casso- wary, tiger-snake, python, blue-tongued lizard, lyre-bird, mutton-bird, oppossum, giant clam, and the hideous deadly stone- fish. There is little which escapes the observation of this witty naturalist- newpaperman. Numerous full-page pho- tographs and a very detailed index complete the book. The reader will regret the omission of a map showing the territory covered. THE COLLECTED LETTERS oE ANTONI VAN LEEUWENHOEK. Part I. Edited, illustrated and annotated by a Committee of Dutch Scientists. Swets and Zeitlinger, Amsterdam. i9 guilders (pa- per); 2i.50 guilders (bound). ii X 8; 454 + 39 plates; I939. This fine commemorative volume, the first of a series that will ultimately com- prise zo when completed, bears witness to the esteem in which one of the earliest biologists is held by his successors and countrymen. The leading scientific in- stitution of the Netherlands, The Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences, jointly with the foremost society of scientific physi- cians have undertaken to publish in this series a complete critical edition of all of van Leeuwenhoek's letters that are ob- tainable. A second aim is to make the works and opinions of Leeuwenhoek in-</page><page sequence="5">2.28 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY telligible to the modern reader. The editors perhaps put it best when they say, "Whoever reads a paper by Leeuwenhoek, even when it deals with a subject in which he specializes, cannot have absolute cer- tainty about what Leeuwenhoek actually saw and described. An interpretation of Leeuwenhoek's observations is a science and art in itself." The present volume contains the earliest letters written by Leeuwenhoek (zI in number, dating from April z8, I673 to February zz, I676). Letters addressed to Huygens, Leibnitz, Magliabechi, and many others are reproduced and many original drawings by Leeuwenhoek are used to properly illustrate the subject matter incorporated in the letters. The right-hand pages of the book are in Eng- lish; the left-hand pages are in Dutch. The numerous explanatory footnotes ac- companying the letters testify to the thoroughness with which the committee is going about its task. The tables of weights and measures used by Leeuwenhoek (he was the first to measure microscopic objects and hence had to select objects which could serve as standards of comparison) and placed at the end of this volume is both of his- torical and practical value. The bio- graphical register of persons mentioned by Leeuwenhoek in his letters is also of great interest. The volume contains an index of names and subjects, also an index of illustrations. The completed series will form a truly monumental work of great historical value. A NATURALIST ON RONA. Essays of a Biologist in Isolation. By F. Fraser Darling. Oxford University Press, New York; The Clarendon Press, Oxford. $z.5o. 8 x ;x + I37 + z8 plates + I folding map; I939. This book definitely adds to Fraser Dar- ling's already solidly grounded reputation as a naturalist and a writer of distinction. North Rona is a tiny island off the north- west coast of Scotland. For human beings it is no gentle environment. But the Darlings (dc and 9 ), from experience and innate liking, know how to get the most out of life in such places. For us in our years of primitive life on three such tiny islands there has never been a dull day, though many an uncomfortable one. Our content has rested on maintaining a spirit of acceptance and having always more than enough to do-apart from goodwill within the family. I mean by a spirit of acceptance a toler- ance of environmental conditions, whatever they may be, and a realization that it is no good trying to live by a routine. You must work when the work is there, and if on the next day a gale of wind and rain makes work impossible, let it be and turn your hand or mind to something else. This is the second point of having more than enough to do; I do not think anybody can be happy in the necessary restriction of island life unless there is an alternative and construc- tive outlet for one's energies. There has been for me on North Rona the writing of this book of essays of forest and island, in slack hours of high summer, on the impossible days of weather about the autumn equinox, and during long winter evenings when nothing could be done outside. The content of the eight essays in this volume is reasonably well indicated by their titles: The vivid frontier; The dis- play of birds; North Rona; The social life of animals; Ron Mor: the great seal; Sanctuaries for wild life; The mystery of antlers; Forest and island. Altogether this is a book that every naturalist, ecologist, and animal be- haviorist will want to read, for it contains much that is original and sound. THE3 GREAT NATURALISTS EXPLORE SOUTH AMERICA. By Paul R. Cutright. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.50. 94 x 64; xii + 340 + 3I plates; I940. Perhaps there remains more unexplored territory in South America than in any other part of the world. There are of course larger areas of barren deserts of sand, snow, and mountain never visited by man; but the unknown recesses of South America are filled with plants and animals that are still new to science or imperfectly known. For the little knowledge that we do have we owe a great deal to those intrepid naturalists and missionaries who braved the rigors of the Amazonian jungle, Argentine pampas, and the moun- tainous Andes. The author of this book presents the</page><page sequence="6">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS important discoveries and observations made by the South American naturalists from the time of Alexander von Humboldt to such contemporary men of science as Murphy, Cherrie, Tate, Ditmars, and others. The reports of various observers on a particular animal are brought to- gether, enabling the reader to get the true picture of the animal's peculiarities. Bats, sloths, monkeys, birds, snakes, crocodiles and the fierce piranhas are just some of the animals ably and interestingly reviewed in this way. Nor are the insects, the joy and bane of all South American explorers omitted. Good illustrations, a bibliog- raphy and an index, and especially an outline map of the continent on which to trace the routes of the great naturalists, complete this fine review of South Ameri- can exploration. A FORGOTTEN RIVER. A Book of Peruvian Travel and Botanical Notes. By Christopher Sandeman. Oxford Univer- sity Press, London, New York and Toronto. $s.oo. 84 x 54; xii + 299 + iS plates + z maps; I939. Here is a book that will make any field naturalist green with envy. It is a diary covering three months of travel in a part of Peru that had not been explored by a scientist since i85o. The author, a well- known botanist, had dreamed of making such an expedition for years. The greater part of Peru lies east of the Andes, and consists of three parallel valleys draining into the Amazon. It is difficult to get from one valley to another without going outside the Peruvian boundary, but no one knows exactly where these boundaries are. Two of the valleys, those of the Marainon and the Ucayali, are well known, but that of the Huallaga is practically virgin territory for the field biologist. The author and a friend crossed the Andes near Cerro de Pasco, whither they had gone on muleback from Lima, then made their way to the source of the river at an altitude of I4,000 feet, constructed a raft on which they descended to 597 feet near Yurimaguas, and then recrossed the Andes to Trujillo on the coast. The story of their adventures stirs the imagi- nation and although they collected only plants their observations on animal life make the book of interest also to the zoologist, and excite his jealousy The book is thoroughly inTexed and documented. THE TEcHNIQUE OF THEORY CONSTRUCTION. International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, Volume II, Number S. By J. H. Woodger. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $I.OO. 92 x 63; vii + 8I; 1939 (paper). A detailed and elementary account of the application of the method of modern symbolic logic to the construction of theories in general, with particular refer- ence to biological theories. The develop- ment of the technique is so clear and simplified that this brochure may well serve as the starting point for anyone wishing to learn the elementary opera- tions in this field. There appears to be a minor slip on p. I3, where the following passage occurs: "Thus, of the following four examples of substitu- tion in 'p implies q', the first three are true statements and the fourth alone is false: (I) (z + 2 = 4) implies (Rome is in Italy) (2z) (z + 2 = 5) implies (Rome is in Italy) (3) (z + 2 = 5) implies (Rome is in France) (4) (2 + 2 = 4) implies (Rome is in France)" Surely if (i) and (3) are "true state- ments", as in the author's sense they obviously are, then by the same token (z) cannot be a "true statement" because z + z does not equal 5, but Rome is in fact in Italy.

An Essay in the History and Sociology of the Negro Race. By W. E. Burghardt Du Bois. Henry Holt and Co., New York. $3.50. 94 X 68; ix + 40I; I939. Here is a straightforward attempt by an educated colored man to tell the story of his race. To those who ask why such a story should be told, the answer is "Be- cause it has never been told before." We all know that the Negro was imported to America and other so-called civilized regions to supply the demand for slave labor, and we know something of the vicissitudes through which the race has passed, particularly in our own southern states. But the innocent reader whose knowledge of African history is confined to Diaz and Vasco de Gower and Living- stone and du Chaillu and the Martin Johnsons is due for a shock when he learns that for nearly a thousand years before any of these worthies the dark continent had been permeated by Islam, and that from Islamic sources can be read the authentic accounts of nations and dynas- ties that rose and fell, of war and famine and the migration of peoples essentially similar to the kind of events that have occurred in every other continent. While Du Bois is not averse to the term "Negro" he prefers to call his people "Black Folk". Although "Negro" is merely the Spanish word for black, it is a term that has been used in many diverse senses by ethnologists, and he believes that less confusion will result from the use of the English transliteration. He in- terprets his race in the broad sense, in- cluding all the dark-skinned, kinky-haired people such as the Dravidians and Berbers, without regard to dolicocephaly or physi- ognomy. To do otherwise would be to restrict the Negro to a group so small that it could not reasonably be designated a race. Du Bois believes that the human species originated in Africa and was dark skinned. Every dark skin today is the persistence of a primitive trait. One difficulty with this theory is that the broad nose and everted lips commonly associated with the Negro race can hardly be considered prim- itive, as they do not occur in any pithecoid stock, which seem to have more features in common with Caucasoid physiognomy. If primitive Homo was black, he must have been more like the black of the Indo- Pacific region than those of Africa. It is now commonly believed that the ancient Egyptians had black skins. Ref- erences to this fact in classical literature are too numerous not to be convincing. Du Bois believes them to have been mulat- toes between barbarian Semites from Ara- bia and civilized Ethopians from the head waters of the Nile, and he derives a rather convincing argument from Ethiopian his- tory which goes back nearly as far as that of Egypt. There are some errors in the book. For instance, the author tells us that after Estebanico was killed by the Indians it was over forty years before another effort was made to penetrate New Mexico.</page><page sequence="8">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 231 As a matter of fact it was less than two years after the arrival at Compostela of Cabeza de Vaca, Estebanico's white com- panion, that Coronado, Alvarado, El Tovar, and de Nizo had penetrated not only New Mexico but Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Also Du Bois has misquoted Wendell Phillips' eulogy of Toussaint l'Ouverture by omitting the reference to John Brown. The author makes an excellent point, after noting that more than ffty million Black Folk were sold into slavery in less than three centuries, by enquiring what would have been the state of white civili- zation today if an equivalent proportion of able-bodied whites had been impressed into slavery in Africa. But in the natural resentment which he feels against those who perpetrated the infamous traffic in human beings he overlooks the fact that the first dealer in slaves in America was a Negro apprentice who learned from his own bitter experience what pecuniary profit might accrue from the sale of his less fortunate brethren to the avaricious whites. A better index and a few more maps would have increased the value of this excellent book. AGRICULTURE IN MODERN LIFE. By 0. E. Baker, Ralph Borsodi, and M. L. Wilson. Harper and Brothers, New York and London. $3.50. 94 X 58; Vii + 303; I939. In this volume Ralph Borsodi, founder of the Suffern School of Living, 0. E. Baker, the distinguished agricultural economist, and M. L. Wilson, Under Secretary of Agriculture, incisively present the case for more self-sufficient living. The book originated in a I938 conference at North- western University on "Distributive Soci- ety and the Possibilities of Decentraliza- tion. " These authors agree that agriculture is more than "soil mining", it is a "way of life". Baker, by elaborate economic sta- tistics; Borsodi, by broad social reasoning; and Wilson, by reference to sociological ideas and facts; present a rural culture where bare sustenance levels are often scarcely maintained, and this where zo per cent of our people live, where 35 per cent of our capital is invested, and where 5o per cent of our citizens are born. The intimate relationship between this rural problem and the urban problem of un- employment and relief is clearly shown. The authors, agreeing that most of the profits of specialized farming are con- sumed in higher distribution costs, advo- cate more self-sufficient farming, not on the Robinson Crusoe level, but by using all the facilities of a scientific and indus- trial age to assist in achieving a better way of living. The final section of the book, a dialogue among the authors, shows their funda- mental agreement on the principles in- volved, but emphasizes that all specific efforts to apply these principles are still in the experimental stage. Altogether this is a significant contribution. CRITIQUES OF RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: I. An Appraisal of Thomas and Znaniecki's The Polish Peasant in Europe arnd America. Bulletin 44. By Herbert Blumer. Statements by Wil- liam 1. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki, a panel discussion, and summary and analysis by Read Bain. Social Science Research Council, 230 Park Ave., New York. $I.oo. 9 x 6; xvii + 2io; I939 (paper). The Social Science Research Council has set out to appraise the outstanding studies which have influenced sociology during the last two decades or more. The pur- pose apparently is to determine whether such studies might lead to "the develop- ment of a self-contained and self-recruiting cult perpetuating inquiries and reports of no substantial social value, either in promise for the future or relevance for the present." A number of books have been chosen to be evaluated and among them the review of The Polish Peasant in Europe and America, by Thomas and Znaniecki, is the first to be completed and thus represents the first of the series to be published. This report contains Profes- sor Blumer's review, statements by the authors of the book and also, what seems to be, a stenographic account of the panel</page><page sequence="9">13Z THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY discussion by members of the Social Science Research Council. Blumer's re- view of The Polish Peasant is painstaking and thorough and his main criticism is levelled at the fallacies that might result from the authors' interpretations of the letters which formed the basic material of the book. The authors, in turn, justify their methodology and fur- ther explain their viewpoint which em- phasizes the subjective individual element in social relations. The panel discussion, as is usual, makes for amusing reading. For reasons not easily understood, Blumer rather than The Polish Peasant was subjected to a verbal assault which was of the "de- fine your terms and what is truth" kind. In addition, almost every member present took the occasion to air his views about matters not directly concerned with the subject under discussion. It is to be hoped that the other publications of the series, especially if they contain reviews as well written as this by Blumer, will not also be used as a vehicle for outbursts of professorial pronouncements. TANGIER ISLAND. A Study of an Isolated Group. By S. Warren Hall, 111. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia; Oxford University Press, London. $i.5o. 9 x 6; x + i.. + X plates; I939. This is an interesting sociological study of an isolated community on an island in Chesapeake Bay. Although politically Tangier is part of Virginia, it is geo- graphically and culturally a part of the peninsula between Chesapeake and Dela- ware Bays. The speech of its inhabitants is entirely free of the characteristic in- flection so wide-spread south of the Poto- mac, partly because their ancestors settled here in the early days before the south- erners had acquired their distinctive in- tonation, and partly because so many of them came from New England. During the two wars that have deci- mated Virginia soil no army ever invaded the Delmarva peninsula-in fact, it is doubtful whether any resident of Tangier ever undertook military service. Slavery was never introduced. The culture of the past has been preserved into the present only slightly altered by the passage of time. The leading spirit among these early settlers was a rugged and vigorous pioneer named Joshua Thomas, around whose memory tradition has so accumulated that he has become a semi-mythical patriarch whose dead hand to a large extent still moulds Tangier culture today. And a good culture it is, in some ways in advance of that on the mainland. It reaches its culmination in a system of socialized medicine, by which each family pays the resident physician a monthly salary re- ceiving in return the medical service it requires without further expenditure. More recently time and the tides of the Chesapeake have taken their toll of that part of the island formerly available for residential and agricultural purposes with the natural result that the dwindling pop- ulation is becoming more and more dependent on the mainland. Its distinc- tive culture is being forced unwillingly into conformity and will eventually dis- appear. The present investigation is timely and was made none too soon. ARCHAEOLOGY AND SOCIETY. By Grahame Clark. Methuen and Co., London. 7s. 6d. net. 74 X 54; xv + 2.2.o + 2.4 plates; I939. This book, which is primarily concerned with prehistoric rather than historic archaeology, is designed for the use of the general reader. Although the author has attempted to write in a simple style using as little as possible of the super- abundant terminology already encumbering the young science of prehistoric archae- ology, nevertheless the general reader who tackles this book will be confronted with a sizable amount of esoteric nomenclature. The definition of prehistoric archaeology and the history o its study are discussed. Then the following subjects are considered in order: (i) how ancient sites are found and the factors instrumental in their dis- covery; (2.) what factors regulate the preservation of early remains; (3) the modes of excavation, and the difficulties incurred therein; (4) the relative and</page><page sequence="10">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS Z33 absolute dating of findings; and (5) the interpretation of the findings in terms of the people of the past and their societies with the interrelations of such aspects as food supply, living area, form of settle- ments and houses, material culture, art and religion, density of population, and social organization and behavior. Numer- ous concrete examples of archaeological work are presented and findings described that range over a great portion of the globe. Lastly, the author discusses ar- chaeology and its present use in spreading propaganda, especially in such countries as Italy, Germany, and Russia. He also considers briefly the falsity of the "su- perior" people conception in the light of the study of prehistoric archaeology. There are many interesting sketches and diagrams and splendid full-page photo- graphs. THOREAU: REPORTER OF THE UNIVERSE. A Selection of His Writings about Nature, for all Readers from Eight Years Old to Eighty. Selected and Arranged by Bertha Stevens. The John Day Co., New York. $X.5o. 8 x 52; Xiv + 2.29 + 8 plates + i folding map; I939. It is only a few of us who can have the privilege of meeting nature on such in- timate terms as Thoreau. The cumber and entanglements of modern civilization are too much with us. But when we take up such a book as this and read of the sounds, colors, and smells of forest and field, and their seasonal fluctuation, or of the stories recorded in the animal tracks in the snow, of the snow crystals that sting his face, or the spears of the much maligned skunk cabbage that herald the coming of spring by perforating the snow banks that remain in sheltered places, or the voice of the stream liberated from its icy prison, or later, the voice of the toad recently waking from its hibernation as it trills its joy at the renascence of life, or the solemn crash of a patriarch of the forest as it falls to its death, we can ask ourselves; Why have we allowed our- selves to become slaves to our environ- ment when we might have been its mas- ters? The woodpeckers still percuss the hollow trunks, the sap still drops from the red maple, and the beach grass still traces circles in the sand, but there is no Thoreau to observe and record these things. Our minds are too occupied in making present wars and preparing for future ones. But at least we can find time to read Thoreau. The fourteen volumes of his collected works are here condensed into one, the material arranged topically. The only adequate expression of the value of such a book that a reviewer can make is to advise all his readers to get it and share it with him. INDIANS OF THE AMERICAS. Historical Pag- eant. By Edwin R. Embree. Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. $2..75. 84 x 53; xi + 26o; '939. An American history "written not around the colonists and immigrants but around the native Americans." The probable course of the Indian peoples as they en- tered this continent by way of Bering Straits and spread fan-like throughout the Western Hemisphere, in successive waves of migrations during pre-historic times, is pictured. These people, of a single stock - Mongoloid - lived together in groups for hundreds or thousands of years, "cut off almost completely from people of other customs. Each group built its life on the basis of the habits it had brought with it and on the environ- ment of its new home." This lack of con- tact with other types of culture and of ideas kept the Indian civilization more or less stabilized at a low level. It was only in those regions where contact among the various tribes was greatest that cul- tural development reached its highest level, namely among the Aztecs in Mex- ico, the Mayas in Central America and the Incas in Peru. Separate sections are devoted to these three groups-their art, learning, religion and history. The latter half of the book is concerned with the different tribes of the North American Indian; and the final pages,</page><page sequence="11">234 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY with the new governmental policy for the present day Indian.

Harper and Brothers, New York and London. $3.00. 88 x S4; viii + 328; I939. It is apparent from this book that in the twenty odd years the author spent as an advertising man in China, he has gained a shrewd insight into Chinese character and custom, a genuine fondness for these people, and a high regard for the many ways in which they have met the struggle for survival and live uncomplainingly in the midst of flood and famine, poverty, scarcity of firewood and pure water, and over-population. Here he shows how rice (in the south) and noodles (in the north), which do not require a long and steady fire for cooking, came to be the staple diets of the country, not because of what "Confucius say", but because of deforestation resulting in scarcity of firewood and game. He shows the extent of the famine that would result if modern plumbing were installed in every home to replace the present custom, found nause- ating by foreigners visiting the country, of collecting human manure for disposal over the fields. He traces the origin of another custom found annoying to for- eigners, namely that of "squeeze", which incidentally seems to be a trait of servants all over the world. He writes of beggars, bandits, noise, superstitions and many other things. Most of the attitudes of mind and customs which non-Chinese find peculiar, Crow finds can be logically traced back to some basic reason. Writ- ten in a popular style and illustrated with amusing anecdotes this book is neverthe- less worth the perusal of the serious minded student of human populations and customs. It has been published in England under the title My Friends, the Chinese. RACIAL PROVERBS. A Selection of the World's Proverbs Arranged Linguistically. With Authoritative Introductions to the Prov- erbs of 27 Countries and Races. By Selwyn G. Champion. The Macmillan Co., New York. $io.oo. 92 x 6; cxxix + 767; I939. Proverbs are important to the human biol- ogist. They are the quintessential dis- tillates from the long boiling of the great pot of human experience. When a Chi- nese boy's grandfather suggests to him that: "If you bow, bow low", he is im- parting to him a bit of wordly wisdom based upon a vast experience of human behavior. Obeisance, toadying, boot- licking, or whatever it is called, may or may not be an advisable action in a par- ticular -situation; but if it is decided to be the sound thing to do in the premises, racial experience has demonstrated that a thorough job had best be done. From the point of view of the student of human behavior, as well as from every other conceivable, except perhaps the narrowly philological, this huge collec- tion of proverbs assembled on a racial (national basis will be a boon to students. Twenty-seven distinguished scholars con- tribute introductions to as many sections, starting with an African section for which R. R. Marett is responsible, and an Arabic section from the pen of Prof. H. A. R. Gibb; and ending with theTurkish (S. Topalian) and the Welsh (J. J. Jones). There is a 2o-page bibliography of author- ities consulted; and three detailed indices. Altogether this collection of 6,ooo odd proverbs from i86 languages and dia- lects, that cost the editor 27 years of research, is a scholarly contribution of a high order of importance. SOCIAL RESEARCH. By Manuel C. Elmer. Prentice-Hall, Inc., New York. $3.00. 8 x 52; XVi + 52.2.; I939. The purpose of this book is to outline the principles and philosophy of research in the social sciences. As the author notes, the methods of research so well estab- lished in other branches of science have not been utilized to any great extent in sociology. One of the reasons, he be- lieves, is that "social research has fre-</page><page sequence="12">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 2-35 quently manifested itself as a vehicle for changing the social order rather than of understanding the social order." This is only too true, although not many professional sociologists are willing to admit it. There are three research tech- niques that the author describes in this book: (i) the general historical method of studying events and institutions, (X) the individual life history, (3) the case method. The last mentioned is discussed in great detail with particular reference to its use in so-called surveys. For all methodological approaches, in general, the author refers at length to the prob- lems involved in sampling, the choice of adequate control groups, the use of statis- tical analysis and the various scales em- ployed in measuring individual and social group attributes and phenomena. Al- though to students trained in biology and biometrics the book may seem very elementary, it is worth reading for the good choice of illustrative examples and adequate bibliography. HORSES AND AMERICANS. By Phil Stong. End paper and chapter heads by Kurt Wiese. Frederick A. Stokes Co., New York. $5.00. I X7; xx + 333 + 65 plates; I939. Here we have a book decidedly easy to read, in which has been accumulated a most amazing quantity of information about the horse and its development in America. No horses were native to the continent when Columbus made his voyages but they arrived here almost on the rudder of the Santa Maria, certainly within ten years of the navigator's death. Velasquez established the animals in Cuba, one of Columbus' first discoveries, in I5II; seven years later the island furnished mounts for the conquest of Mexico. The author brings us into close contact with the different breeds of horses, which we are familiar with in a general way, and explains their usefulness as decided by their build-saddle and race horses, hun- ters, cow ponies, heavy Percherons, Cly- desdales, Belgians, Morgans, and just horses, some pure bred and some crossed. Stong also makes us aware of the exceed- ingly important part played by the horse during the settlement of this country, and speculates as to how much the de- velopment and extension of our territory might have been retarded without them. Many illustrations are included, a sub- stantial bibliography, and an index. ANTHROPOLOGY AND RELIGION. By Peter H. Buck. Yale University Press, New Haven; Oxford University Press, London. $I.50. 8 x 52; viii + 96 + I folding chart; 1939. This book embodies the sixteenth series of Terry Lectures on Religion in the Light of Science and Philosophy, delivered at Yale University. Professor Buck, who was born in New Zealand of a Maori mother, traces the history of Polynesian religion, its development and solidifica- tion, and eventual destruction with the advent of Christianity. The Polynesians deified certain of their ancestors and thus created their gods, the priesthood de- veloped and fixed the theology and, as the author says, the man-created gods in turn re-made man. The. culture and whole civilization of the Polynesians be- came centered around their religion. Then came the Christian missionaries with a new set of morals and a new the- ology and by their well-known persuasive methods converted the natives. As a consequence the whole fabric of the Poly- nesian civilization came apart. In clos- ing, the author points to the importance of Christianity in the development of western civilization and warns of the pos- sible downfall of this civilization if Christianity should be abandoned. An interesting and well-written book. ' THE CULTURE HIsTORICAL METHOD OF ETHNOLOGY. The Scientific Approach to the Racial Question. By Wilhelm Schmidt. Translated by S. A. Sieber. Fortuny's, New York. $s.oo. 9 x 6; xxx + 383; I939. The primary purpose of this tedious, dull, and badly written treatise, appears to have been to bring about a wider dis- semination of the ideas and theories of</page><page sequence="13">136 THE QUAIRTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Graebner and Schmidt about what they hold to be the true methodological gospel of ethnology. Particularly there was apparently a hope that by translating Graebner's Methode and spreading it about in chunks through a diluent it might be made readable. It is our duty to report that the hope was largely illusory. As the result of a prolonged, careful, and sympathetic study of this volume it is our conviction: (a) that Boas was pro- foundly right and wise in refusing to accept the Kulturkreis theory of Frobenius, Graebner, Schmidt and Co., because "it is based on the assumption of the per- manence of correlations of supposedly identical cultural traits, the identity of which has not been safely established and which in modern cultures prove to be unstable"; and (b) that if the company wants to promote the sale of its eyewash it will do well to employ a bright young man who can write clearly and logically so to put the product out in a brighter, cleaner, and generally more attractive package. OUT OF REVOLUTION. Autobiography of Western Man. By Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. William Morrow and Co., New York. $6.oo. 84 X 514; Xii + 795; I939. Out of Revolution, an autobiography of western man, is a philosophy of history with "revolution" as its arbitrary unit of progress. The author attempts to show the human experiences and thoughts underlying revolutions and the inter- dependence of revolutions to each other. The author treats history as the auto- biography of man and the revolutions that have made history and have given "'man's soul a new relation between pres- ent, past and future" as having their foundations in the alternating passions of humankind. In the first part of the book the author discusses the great revolutions of Russia, France, England, and Germany, a four- hundred-year span of history; in the sec- ond part, the clerical revolutions in Italy and the American Revolution. The author quite often sacrifices clarity of meaning to a well-turned sentence or phrase and drowns the meaning of his analyses in a flood of unnecessary ver- bosity. The volume is well illustrated, and has a detailed index. An explanatory list of maps and illustrations is appended to the text. RELIGION IN PRIMITIVE SOCIETY. By Wilson D. Wallis. F. S. Crofts and Co., New York. $5.oo. 9 x 6; ix + 388 + 8 plates; I939. Wallis presents a thorough and scholarly review of the ritualistic manifestations of religion and of the concept of sacredness in various religions. In order, he de- scribes the several kinds of sacred places, objects, trees, animals and persons. He then discusses the rituals of consecration, purification, sacrifice and feasts. The book ends with chapters on the beliefs about life after death. Although, as the title indicates, the author is concerned with the religion of pre-literate cultures he discusses equally the manifestations of Hindu, Mohammedan, Roman, Greek and Jewish (thereby also the Christian) re- ligions. The great value of this work lies in the fact that it is devoted to a description rather than to an interpreta- tion of the overt practices of religion. For this reason and because it contains an extensive bibliography this book will without doubt become a standard source of reference on the subject. UNDER YOUR FEET. The Story of the American Mound Builders. By Blanche Busey King. Dodd, Mead and Co., New York. $X.50. 82 x 54; Xii + I69 + 75 plates; I939. The story of the moundbuilder and his place in American pre-history has never been adequately told. Although the val- leys of the Ohio and Mississippi are full ofhis works, many of which have been excavated, the knowledge about his cul- ture is in a widely scattered state; it has never been coordinated, or even collated. In this book an active archaeologist with a curiously diffuse literary style has</page><page sequence="14">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 2.37 attempted to supply this deficiency. Al- though largely a recital of personal experience and crowded with reminis- cences that have nothing to do with archaeology, it is a readable work that covers the ground thoroughly and gives an accurate account of the mysterious progenitors of the modern Indian. The illustrations are good, the documentation weak, and there is no index. 'IC. ANTHROPOLOGIA CRIMINAL (Conferencias e Communicafes). By Leonidio Ribeiro. Imprensa Nacional, Rio de Janeiro. IO4 x 72; Xii + 97 + 27 plates; I937 (paper). This volume contains a collection of papers presented and read by the author at several Portuguese universities and at the I937 Paris Congress on Legal Medicine and Industrial Hygiene. The articles concern three subjects: juvenile delin- quency, homosexuality, and the effects of leprosy on fingerprints. The papers regarding the first two subjects contain mainly summary reviews of theories. The author is an adherent of the neo-Lom- brosian school of criminologists and be- lieves that delinquency as well as homo- sexuality represent manifestations of bio- logical variations and consequently are medical more than police problems. Of particular interest are the observations presented relative to the changes in the fingerprints as a result of leprosy. Ap- parently this disease brings about the one exception to the fixity of fingerprints and creates a problem relative to police iden- tification. In turn, the author notes, this alteration may be of value in the study of the course of the disease. MY LIFE. Autobiography of Havelock Ellis. Houghton Miffin Co., Boston. $3.75. 84 x 58; Xii + 647 + 8 plates; I939. Havelock Ellis, stating his belief that "of all forms of prose, there is no form so precious in its nature and so permanent in its value as an autobiography", defines the purpose of My Life as the "desire that my experience of life may help those who come after me to live their own lives". The work emphasizes the "inner man" and is chiefly noteworthy for the im- passioned correspondence with his wife. The book was "an act of prolonged pre- cision in cold blood, beyond anything else that I have written" and was com- pleted only shortly before his death. The style is detached, calm, rambling and reminiscent, enlivened only by the cor- respondence. The noble plan of showing that "this is life" achieves more of ashes and dust than of living. Of itself, the book, though beautifully written, arouses no intensity of interest. Any permanent value that the autobiography may pos- sess lies in the fact that it serves as a docu- mentation of the actually far more in- teresting life and times of its famous author. FAMILY INCOME AND EXPENDITURES: Plains and Mountain Region. Part One, Family Income. U. S. Department of Agriculture. Miscellaneous Publication No. 34S. Con- sumer Purchases Study. Urban and Village Series. By Gertrude S. Weiss, Day Monroe and Kathryn Cronister. Government Printing Office, Washington. 30 cents. 98 X 51; iv + 330; I939 (paper). This investigation was carried on from January I935 to December I936, in several small cities and villages in the Plains and Mountain Regions of the west, and covers the pooled income of native-born families consisting of husband and wife, children, and others living with them. The in- come, both earned and unearned, is broken down and studied statistically from many angles. The numerous tables recorded should be of value to students of socio-economics. They may also be use- ful and enlightening in the study of population-all this provided the results indicated by the different tables can be relied upon as to the information upon which they are based. One gets the im- pression that some of the data used might not be reliable. This seems to apply principally to the report on income of the different groups. There does not seem</page><page sequence="15">238 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY to be any method of checking statements made as to income. THE EYAK INDIANS OF THE COPPER RIVER DELTA, ALASKA. By Kaj Birket-Smith and Frederica de Laguna. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia; Levin and Munks- gaard, Copenhagen. $6.oo. 92 x 6; 592. + I7 plates + I folding chart; I93 8 (paper). This long and somewhat rambling ethno- logical account of the Eyak Indians is based upon material gathered by the authors during an archaeological and ethnological expedition to Prince William Sound during the summer of I933. In the first part of the report the authors discuss in detail the various phases of Eyak material, their social and intellec- tual culture. Part II, devoted to native folk lore, consists largely of a series of stories and legends which the authors have repeated as nearly as possible in the language of their native informants. Some of these are quite delightful in their simplicity. Part III is a critical analysis of the previous work on the Eyak, and Part IV attempts to analyse the various forms of Eyak culture discussed in Part I. Appendices include a genealogical table and over z5 pages of Eyak vocabu- lary. Some excellent photographs, maps and a few text figures supplement the work. There is also an extensive bib- liography. PEOPLE. The Quantity and Quality of Popu- lation. By Henry Pratt Fairchild. Henry Holt and Co., New York. $3.00. 81 X 5; [6] + 315 + 8 plates; I939. This is a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative aspects of population with the mathematics omitted. Specialists who enjoy reading vital statistics can ob- tain them from other sources, but the ob- ject of this work is to stimulate interest in population problems among those who have had no special preparation for quan- titative work. The doctrine of Malthus is discussed with great clarity, and is interpreted in a somewhat different form from its popular conception. The problems attending birth control and the qualitative aspect of population, i.e., eugenics, are dis- cussed lucidly. The index is very analy- tic and covers I S pages. RURAL MIGRATION IN THE UNITED STATES. Works Progress Administration, Division of Research. Research Monograph XIX. By C. E. Lively and Conrad Taeuher. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington. 9x X 64; xxi + i92 + iS plates; I939 (paper). As a basis for the WPA programs of un- employment relief and guided migration, the movements of rural population have been studied both before and since I930. The analysis is based on census data, and on data gathered directly from 2.2,ooo rural families in field surveys. Wide- spread economic need in rural areas is made clearly evident. ZOOLOGY CELLULOID SAFARI. Filming Big Game from Cape to Cairo. By Stirling Gillespie. Photographs by J. Blake Dalrymple and the Author. Blackie and Son, London and Glasgow. 2.os. 6d. net. 8' x 52; X + 2.78 + 63 plates + I map; I939. This is the record of the experiences of two young Scotsmen who traveled from Cape- town to Cairo in "Big Bertha", a Ford V8 sedan, covered more than zs ,ooo miles mainly along the eastern coast of Africa, and arrived in Cairo three days sooner than the 455-day allotted schedule. The purpose of the expedition was to photo- graph and film educational material on the native life and wild animal life of Africa for the use of British and Empire Schools. The book is written in a highly entertaining conversational style, and no one who reads it will be able to suppress laughter over the difficulties incurred by the young men in getting "Big Bertha"</page><page sequence="16">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 239 to Cairo. Very interesting to photog- raphers will be the descriptions of the stalking of big prey with cameras. "It was strange that we had come through Africa without a rifle or shot-gun.... But at no time were we tempted to destroy the creatures we were photographing, nor did we find it necessary to kill in self- defense, except in the case of two deadly snakes." There are many amusing anec- dotes about the natives, especially about the Zulus who cast aside all things native as contemptible. These natives had donned such European clothing as moth- eaten football jerseys, tams, berets, felt hats, while some, preferring to exhibit their entire wardrobes, would wear as many as three greatcoats on the most sweltering days. This book gives an excellent picture of the population of Africa, both white and native, its wild life, and the topography of the l-and with emphasis laid on the traveling conditions on man-made routes and off the beaten tracks. There are numerous full-page photographs. On the front end-paper there is a map showing the route taken by the two photographers. MY FRIENDS THE BABOONS. By Eugene N. Marais. Methuen and Co., London. ss. net. 74 x 52; vii + I7.4; I939. The author believes that If mankind wishes to escape the doom which now threatens its existence on earth; if, in the last ditch, man still wishes to fight unrelenting nature, it would appear possible only by the adoption of one strategical measure and that is the variation from type and the great increase in population must be stopped in some scientific way. For this purpose science must be called in, and the first step towards acquiring the necessary knowledge to arm man for his last struggle for existence is a thorough study of the animal species most nearly related to man-the apes and anthro- poid apes. This account of the activities of a colony of baboons of South Africa is interesting, but not entirely convincing. We doubt that mankind will be saved by a study of this nature. The entire account of the behavior of these apes is tinged with the author's anthropomorphic conception of how they should behave, and as a con- sequence one becomes skeptical. This is unfortunate, for there is much material gathered here for. the first time on the social life of baboons in their wild and natural state. In one of the chapters the author ex- pounds the theory "that birth-pain is the key that awakens the psychological im- petus of mother-love." "In the baboon mother-love reaches a higher stage of development than in any other animal in our country and the birth-pain she suffers is proportionate to it." WILD ANIMALS. Great Wild Animal Stories of Our Day. Compiled by Frances E. Clarke. The Macmillan Co., New York. $X.50. 84 X 54; x + 335; I939. The charm of this collection lies not only in its beautifully written stories and essays (i5 in number), but also in the well-selected diversity of its subject mat- ter and appeal. For the reader who de- sires an essay on the spiritual side of nature and the conservation of its wild life and plant beauty, there is the article "Thou Shalt Not Kill", by James Oliver Curwood who died before this, his last article, could be put into type; for the reader who likes a story of nature with a dash of Tolstoi-like religious moral at the conclusion, there is "The Truce of God," by Laurence Housman. For one who likes a good animal story with action, but no sentimentality, there is the story, "The Black Coyote," by Myron M. Stearns; for one who likes an animal story with a tinge of sentimental tragedy, there is the story of the giant ape mother "The Prisoner," by Madelon Lulofs. For the reader who likes his story with a dash of comedy there is the story of Ulysses Skunk entitled "The Lord of the Trail", by Kenneth Gilbert. Muztagh, the great white Indian elephant; Ales- sandro, the little hurdy-gurdy monkey who returned to the jungle to dance be- fore his jungle relatives in a green pea- jacket; Joe Dokes, the African-born circus lion who was a beloved retired veteran of the Grand Amalgamated Circus; and Koala, the little Australian marsupial</page><page sequence="17">240 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY bear, are some animal-heroes, about whom not-to-be-forgotten stories have been writ- ten, that have been included in this ex- cellent anthology. AMERICAN MAMMALS: Their Lives, Habits, and Economic Relations. By W. J. Hamilton, Jr. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York and London. $3.75. 9 x 6; xii + 434; I939. Mammalogists, naturalists, sportsmen, and biologists will rejoice to hear that there is finally available an up-to-date book on the biology of mammals. Pre- vious works have heretofore been limited in scope, usually being either taxonomic, distributional, or economic, with scat- tered notes on behavior and life history. Hamilton presents a general and broad review of the lives, habits, and economic relations of American mammals. The book properly starts out with the ancestry and classification of the mam- mals, followed by chapters on their general biology which include their adap- tations, food, reproduction, homes, hiber- nation and migration, populations, be- havior, and distribution. The final chap- ters are devoted to the economic impor- tance of these animals, their usefulness and destructiveness, and their value as fur and game. THE WAY OF A LION. By Alden G. Stevens. Drawings by George F. Mason. Frederick A. Stokes. Co., New York. $I.75. 858x 54; XVi + I44; I939. The Way of a Lion represents the best in animal stories. It is a far cry from the usual sentimentalized fiction. This is not the life history of an imaginary lion, but one which the author himself has seen and about which he has heard much from the Masai warriors of East Africa. The hero, a great giant of a lion with a massive head, is not only picturesque but full of cunning. His prowess as a hunter had spread the length and breadth of the Serengetti. The author, however, does not just present the lion as a mighty monarch of the jungle. The reader is told of the lion's birth (ca. i9z0) in a cave on a hill somewhere north of Ngoro Ngoro, his awkward cubhood, his or- phaned, lonely life as a cub in the bush, his youth and mating, his supremacy as a lor of the plains, encounters with men and animals, and finally, death met cour- ageously and in the prime of life. Here is a story that is realistic, but not senti- mentalized; vivid, but not sensational. The story has a rich setting-the plains and forests of East Africa with the in- tensely hot sun of the "blue, blue sky of Africa" blazing down upon all. There are seven full-page drawings and numerous marginal sketches. A fascinating record of animal life for adults and children from IS on. DESTRUCTIVE AND USEFUL INsECTs: Their Habits and Control. Second Edition. By C. L. Metcalf and W. P. Flint. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York and London. $7.50. 9 x 6; xvi + 98I; I939- The great advances in the science of in- sects, especially in the field of economic entomology has made a complete revision of the first edition (Q. R. B., Vol. 4, p. 436) of this book necessary. The methods of insect control with insecticides of arsenic and lead have been replaced, life histories have been worked out, and the bionomics, morphology, and physiology of insects have progressed to such an extent that nearly every page of this huge text has been altered. An interesting new feature is a key to the orders of insects in their immature stages in addition to the usual key to the adults. The first part of the book is devoted to the morphology, development, and classification of insects, followed by chapters on insect control. From this point on the insects are described accord- ing to the host plant or animal. The insect's importance, the type of injury it incurs, the plants attacked, its dis- tribution, life history, appearance, and habits are all part of the information given for each species. Following the dis- cussion are one or more references to more detailed works.</page><page sequence="18">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 24I This excellent textbook is profusely illustrated and well indexed.

THE CARE OF A SMALL RAT COLONY. By Rolland J. Main. C. V. Mosby Co., St. Louis. $z.oo. 8' x 54 IOI; I939. Careful planning is as necessary for the successful colonization of rats as it is for any other group of the animal king- dom that is to be subjected to experi- mentation. The present treatise is a report of the "experience rather than a discussion of the entire field" in the estab- lishment of a small rat colony at the Medical College of Virginia, and includes "'that information of which we were in dire need when starting the colony.'" Existing publications gave some valuable infor- mation (a list of IS titles is given in the appendix, which also contains a list of firms where cages and equipment, and feeds can be obtained), but mostly it was by the method of "trying and rejecting various procedures" that the satisfactory methods herein described concerning equipment, hygiene, rearing, feeding, and many phases of daily routine were obtained. Included in the text are il- lustrations of apparatus and charts. A number of amusing rat caricatures, drawn by Dr. Margaret Pennington, are used as chapter tailpieces. An excellent index is provided. THE BUTTERFLIES OF THE NIAGARA FRONTIER REGION and Beginner's Guide for Collecting, Rearing and Preserving Them. Builletin of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences, Volume XIX, Number x. By William Wild. Buffalo Museum of Science Press, Buffalo, N. Y. $i.oo. 9x 4 61 s; I939 (paper). The list of eight families of butterflies native to the Niagara frontier region will be of interest to only a limited number of naturalists working in that region. How- ever, the monograph contains much that will be of interest to everyone everywhere whose studies concern the Lepidoptera. The discussions on the life history of butterflies in general, the methods of collecting, rearing, and preserving butter- flies and moths will appeal to the latter group. In the matter of classification, the author has followed McDunnough's Check List of I938. The iS. figures, the 8 plates carrying 88 illustrations, the bibliography of ii titles, and the complete and well-arranged index serve the volume well in its intended purpose as a field guide and reference book. A LABORATORY GUIDE IN ENTOMOLOGY: For Introductory Courses. By Robert Matheson. Comstock Publishing Co., Ithaca, N. Y. $z.oo. 1xI X74; vii + i35; 1939- This well-planned and carefully-prepared</page><page sequence="19">242. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY manual is intended for use in the labora- tory work connected with an introduc- tory course in entomology. The nature of the work is such that a fundamental knowledge of invertebrate zoology is prerequisite for undertaking it. The material is organized around the taxo- nomic and general biological aspects of entomology. The first nine studies are devoted to the extemal structure and metamorphosis of a typical insect. There follows, in studies X to XXI, a series of discussions on the characteristics used in classifying the principal families of ten orders of our common insects. Studies XXII to XXVIII deal with the behavior and economic importance of several groups of insects, particularly insect pests. An appendix dealing with methods of collecting, preparing, mounting, preserv- ing and rearing insects, and an informative glossary serve to round out this compre- hensive and authoritative laboratory manhal. CANADIAN LAND BIRDS. A Pocket Field Guide. By P. A. Taverner. Illustrated by Allan Brooks, F. C. Hennessey and P. A. Tav- erner. David McKay Co., Philadelphia. $X.5o. 62 x 48; 2.77; I939. This colorful field guide of Canadian birds will undoubtedly acquire immediate pop- ularity among proessional as well as amateur ornithologists. The early chapters deal briefly with the following subjects: (i) methods of bird study; (X) methods of attracting birds to our gardens; (3) plans for building bird houses; and (4) the topography of the characteristic land bird. There follows a comprehensive field color key, and finally a listing of some thirty-eight families of familiar Canadian birds, together with brief notes on the size, field marks, voice, habitat, nest and eggs of each group. The scientific nomenclature follows the check list of the American Ornithologists' Union (193i) edition. The carefully drawn and beautifully colored plates greatly enhance the value of the volume as a pocket guide. FIELDBOOK OF ILLINOIS LAND SNAILS. Manual 2. By Frank C. Baker. Natural History Survey Division, Urbana, Ill. $i.oo. 78 x 44; xi + i66; I939. This is a perfect example of what a field book should be. The brief introduction contains an account of the anatomy of a land snail, instructions for collecting shells and displaying them in a cabinet, and descriptions of the physiography and geology o Illinois. The systematic por- tion of the book is exhaustive, covering all snails known to have been taken in the state, whether native or exotic. Of each one there is an excellent drawing. Snails whose presence is doubtful are listed without illustration, but with a biblio- graphic reference in an appendix. There is a topical index of six pages and a systematic index of one, yet the book can be comfortably carried in the coat pocket. A field book of this sort will be welcomed by every field malacologist. AN INTRODUCTION TO ANIMAL BIOLOGY. By John B. Parker and John J. Clarke. C. V. Mosby Co.} St. Louis. $3.75. 82 x 542;503 1939. Taking Agassiz' advice to "Study Nature, not books," the authors intend their book to be used in conjunction with a laboratory course covering essentially the same material. With a few exceptions each chapter could beused as the basisof a laboratory exercise, yet there is a suf- ficient amount of theoretical material in- cluded to make a well-rounded text. The authors, who are on the staff of the Catholic University of America, have been particularly careful in their handling of topics that touch on religious faith and morality-for example, the para- graphs on evolution and the statements on venereal disease. There are many il- lustrations. SEPIA. L.M.B.C. Memoirs on Typical Brit- ish Marine Plants and Animals. Edited by R. J. Daniel, XXXII. By David H. Tompsett. University Press</page><page sequence="20">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 2-43 of Liverpool, Liverpool. i..s. 6d. net. 9x X 6; vii + I84 + 24 plates; I939. This is a very thorough anatomical study of one of the more plentiful species of Cephalopods in European waters. It is of course highly technical and of no special interest except to the systematist. The most striking anatomical feature of this squid is the hectocotylus, which is never detached, but is used by the male to transfer the spermatozoa from its own mnantle cavity to the bursa copulatrix of the female. There is nlothing in the treatise about the cleavage of the egg, or any embryological processes, and natu- rally, nothing about the probable evolution of Cephalopods from the prim- itive molluscan type, though this latter is figured and briefly described. The 24 plates are beautifully prepared. THE TRAMPLING HERD. The Story of the Cattle Range in America. By Pa4l 1. Wellman. Illustrated by F. Miller. Carrick and Evans, New York. $3.00. 82 X 5 8; 433; I939. In i52i an enterprising Spaniard brought 6 or 7 calves to Mexico. They thrived and multiplied, and the business of rais- ing cattle flourished beyond the Rio Grande. The "trampling herd" gradu- ally displaced the buffalo from the prairies to the north; and by the middle of the igth century they grazed on open range as far as the Canadian border, and from the Mississippi to the Rockies. The brief era of the traditional "old west", of Billy- the-Kid, Wild Bill Hickok, and Wyatt Earp, of recorded "trail-drives", booming cow towns, and gun fights, marked the disappearance of the open range. Mr. Wellman's story of the transition from free land to fenced fields reveals the chang- ing balance between a rapidly growing population and its natural resources. It is an interesting book, as readable as the author's novel of cowboy life, jubal Troop. THE GEESE FLY HIGH. By Florence P. Jaques. Illustrated by Francis L. jaques. University of Min- nesota Press, Minneapolis. $3 .00. IO2 X 72; [6] + I03; I939. The Rainey Wild Life Sanctuary, now owned by the Audubon Society, is the principal setting of this book. Mrs. Jaques vividly describes how she and her husband followed the ducks and geese in their southward migration, and observed them from the Louisiana marshlands. The volume contains little of biological interest, but is rather devoted to details of the charms and chafes of the rugged existence led by the vacationers. Other- wise it is a series of excellent action pic- tures done in black and white by Mr. Jaques, and colored in the words of his companion. FOOD HABITS OF PRAIRIE DOGS. U. S. Department of Agriculture. Circular No. 529. By Leon H. Kelso. Government Printing Office, Washington. 5 cents. 98 x 6; I4; I939 (paper). This short bulletin presents the results of laboratory analyses of the stomachs of some 545 North American prairie dogs. About 97.47 percent of the diet of the three species examined was made up of vegetation; 78.32. percent being repre- sented by plants important for forage or crop value, and about I9.I5 percent by those unimportant for these purposes. The animal matter (2. 53 percent) eaten by these forms consisted mostly of cut- worms, grasshoppers and ground beetles. A list of ii bibliographic references is present. FIELD GUIDE TO LOWER AQUARIuM ANI- MALS. By Edward T. Boardman. Cranbrook In- stitute of Science, Bulletin No. x6. Bloom- field Hills, Mich. $i.oo (paper); $i.5o (cloth). 9 x 6; I86; I939. This bulletin was designed primarily "as an easy reference for amateur naturalists and nature counsellors who wish to know what lower animals can be kept in home aquaria." Fishermen will also find this book full of useful information concern- ing fish food and fish bait. The text</page><page sequence="21">44 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY concerns itself mostly with the habitats and habits of these animals, and the il- lustrations aid their identification. There is a selected bibliography and a glossary. THE EXTERNAL ANATOMY OF THE LARVA OF THE PACIFIC COAST WIREWORM. U. S. Department of Agriculture. Technical Bul- letin No. 693. By H. P. Lanchester. Government Print- ing Office, Washington. Io cents. 91 x 57; 40; 1939. This study forms part of a general program of investigation directed toward the economic control of wireworms in the Pacific Northwest. It is preliminary to comparative studies of the several species of wireworms found in that general sec- tion. The later studies will be primarily taxonomic, but based on this morphologi- cal study. The descriptions are accom- panied by line drawings and the work concludes with a bibliography of 2. titles. ANIMALIUM CAVERNARUM CATALOGUS. Pars I2, 13, 14. By B. Wolf. W. jfnk, The Hague and 's-Gravenhage. Single copy Dutch Fl. io.6o; subscription price Dutch Fl. 8. IO4 X 74; 2.98; I937-38 (paper). These numbers of a thorough catalogue of cavern fauna throughout the world con- tain authors from NOR to SCH, a list of the caves of Jugoslavia, a supplement containing data on phyla found during and after the preparation of the previous parts, and the index for Volumes I to III. Previous parts have been noticed in Vol. IO, P. I04 and Vol. ii, p. I03 of this Review. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PUBLICATIONS IN ZOOLOGY. Vol. 43, Nos. II, 12, 13.

The Macmill/k Co., New York; The University Press, Cam- bridge. $i6.oo. io x 63; xxxviii + 930 + i62. plates; I939. This book is intendea to replace Types of British Vegetation-published in i9ii, and out of print for the last 2.0 years. Tan- sley writes in the preface: The knowledge of our natural and semi-natural plant communities is much wider and especially much deeper than it was in I9II. On the other hand, vari- ous problems that we then envisaged as relatively simple have shown themselves upon further study to be very complex indeed and not yet susceptible of satisfactory solution. Thus the writing of this book has been a very different task from the writing of Types. In I9II we wrote practically all we knew and a good deal that we guessed; and though many of our guesses were not far from the truth others have not unnaturally turned out to be wide of the mark. Although the book has been constructed on the compilation plan it is far more than a compilation, as the reader quickly per- ceives. The author's very wide knowl- edge of ecology and extensive experience in appraising available information on British plant communities have enabled him to present a comprehensive treatise which will long serve as a guide for the investigator and student. The 43 chap- ters (with references) are arranged under the following main headings: The Brit- ish Islands as environment of vegetation; History and existing distribution of vege- tation; The nature and classification of vegetation; The woodlands; The grass- lands; The Hydroseres: Freshwater, marsh, fen and bog vegetation; Heath and moor; Mountain vegetation; Maritime and sub- marine vegetation. The numerous il- lustrations and excellent working index help to make this a standard reference work of the first rank of importance-one that should be made available to all stu- dents of ecological problems.</page><page sequence="22">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 2.45 I CEREALI DELL'AFRICA ITALIANA. I. I frumenti dell'Africa Orientale Italiana studiati su materiali originali. By Raffaele Ciferri and Guido R. Giglioli. Preface by A. Maugini. Regio Istituto Agronomico per l'Africa Italiana, FirenZe. 40 Lire. 9&amp;5 x 6Q; ix + 298 + i folding chart; 1939 (paper). After the conquest of Ethiopia, the Italian government has directed its major efforts to the development of the agricultural production of the country so that it would at least satisfy the local needs and, hope- fully, increase the food supply of Italy. Extensive and intensive research in agri- culture and the allied branches of science have therefore been greatly encouraged and among others a large scale investiga- tion on grain cereals has been systematic- ally organized. The initial step in this investigation has been a survey of the cereals that have been acclimated in Ethiopia and this monograph is the first of a series of reports on the observations. It is concerned with the taxonomic classi- fication of the species and varieties of Triticum found. Altogether Z93 varieties are described in full and illustrated. Of this number 97 varieties belong to T. turgidum abyss., 92 to T. durum abyss., 6o to T. vulgare (ligulatum) and the re- maining belong to T. dicoccum, T. pyra- midale, T. polonicum and T. compactum. Specimens of other kinds of Triticum not heretofore described have also been un- covered but whether they represent stable varieties or simply hybrids will have to be decided by genetic experimentation. The geographic distribution of thespecies and varieties as well as their frequency are also described. It is a thorough anc im- portant contribution to the subject and one which brings to date, extends and also clarifies the observations of Koernicke, Chiovenda, Percival and Vavilov. EARTH'S GREEN MANTLE. Plant Science for the General Reader. By Sydney Mangham. Foreword by Sir Arthur W. Hill. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.50. 85 x 55; 32.2 + 40 plates; 1939. In this popularly written account of plant life the author discusses with scientific accuracy the various aspects of plants and their relation to the environment. He attempts to give a realization of the true significance of the plant in human affairs. With the aid of photographic and other illustrations, he outlines the story of man's continuous efforts to understand and utilize the wealth of plant life; of the parts played by other branches of science in the development of plant knowledge; and of the use made, and perhaps yet to be made, of such knowledge. He tells something of the history of the use of plants; of the early explorations and dis- coveries when the search was for spices from the orient, of the sixteenth century immigration of the potato from South America to Europe; and of the Dutch use of marram grass to stabilize sand dunes and cord grass to reclaim shallow lands from the ocean. An appendix contains suggestions for further reading, and there is a long and complete index. MAGIC GARDENS. A Modern Chronicle of Herbs and Savory Seeds. By Rosetta E. Clarkson. Illustrated from the Old Herbals and Ancient Gardening Books. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.00. 82 X 54; xviii + 369; I939. Magic Gardens has been, perhaps uncon- sciously, in the making for many years. The author, an ardent herb cultivator at Salt Acres, her place in Connecticut, and editor of the Herb Journal, is an assiduous collector of literature on the subject- much of which goes back to very early times. Herein she writes enthusiastically and entertainingly of the i6th century "knotted" gardens of England, the "par- terres" of France, the mazes and labyrinths of early Roman and Egyptian times. Detailed descriptions of something over 2.oo plants are given and their uses in medicine, cooking, potpourris and sachets. "From undated times herbs of the field have played an almost unbelievably prominent part, not only in the life of the individual in his own home, but in the existence of civilized nations.... Today, any fra- grant flower or leaf is almost certainly a descendant of an old-time herb."</page><page sequence="23">246 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY The volume is illustrated by reproduc- tions from old herbals and prints and concludes with indexes of books and authors, of herbs, and of subject matter. BOOK OF THE BROADLEAF TREES. The Story and the Economic, Social, and Cultural Contribution of the Temperate Broad-Leaved Trees and Forests of the World. By Frank H. Lamb. W. W. Norton and Co., New York. $3.75. 8- x 58; 367 + 4I plates; I939. Anyone who has ever stood under some famous elm or oak and tried to visualize the historic scenes that occurred within sight of its ancient trunk, or anyone who has entered a forest and felt thrilled and somewhat awed at the majestic dignity of its trees will renew these pleasures by reading this book. It is not a scientific treatise on trees, but an account of their history, romance, uses, beauty. The author has travelled widely and his first- hand experience enables him to speak authoritatively. He is acquainted with the Australian eucalyptus and African baobab, as well as with the birches of our North and the live oaks of the South. All those having any interest in broad leaf trees, whether from an economic, scientific, or historic standpoint, will not only find this book interesting but in- formative. It is well illustrated. PROPAGATION OF HORTICULTURAL PLANTS. By Guy W. Adriance and Fred. R. Brison. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $3.00. 9 x 6; ix + 3I4; I939. An excellent text for students in horti- culture. The essential features of plant structure and repro- duction have been introduced in their relation to seed production, root formation, wound healing, and other practical phases of plant propagation. The methods of asexual propagation, including bulbs, layerage, cuttage, bud7ding, and grafting are considered in com- prehensive form. Included also are detailed discussions of the propogation of certain important species, such as the peach, plum, apricot, cherry, almond, apple, grape, etc. Sec- tions are devoted to plant diseases, trans- planting, and the growing and handling of nursery stock. The volume is well documented and illustrated and has an adequate index. INTRODUCTION TO FLORAL MECHANISM. By S. G. Jones. Chemical Publishing Co., New York. $4.oo. 8' x 58; xi + 2.74; I939. This book, for students in technical col- leges and first-year university students, gives a new approach to the study of flowering plants. Emphasis is put on the flower as the mechanism of inheritance and the structure, development and functions of flowers are studied from this point of view. Recent developments in cytology and genetics are applied to heredity, hybridization and plant breeding. The latter part of the book (Part II) discusses the keying of a plant to its taxonomic group. This part systematically treats 2.i selected families of monocotyledons and dicotyledons. The 70 original, full-page illustrations are finely done and add much to the value of the text. There is a small glossary of terms. The index is well done but the bibliography is brief and not entirely adequate. EDIBLE WILD PLANTS. By Oliver P. Medsger. With an introduc- tion by Ernest T. Seton. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.50. 8 x 5; xv + 32.3 + i6 plates; I939. In this comprehensive and useful hand- book the author describes in detail 69 species of edible fruits and berries, 33 of salad plants and potherbs, 9 of roots and tubers, ii of sugars and gums, iS of nuts, 2.o of beverage and flavoring plants, iS of seed and seed pods, and lists many more with brief descriptions. In addition to the regular index and in the place of a key, the author has included an excellent "finding index" which gives the names of plants, both common and scientific, with the range, season, and a few of the most pronounced characteristics. The volume is well illustrated with pen and ink drawings and photographs. There is, however, no bibliography.</page><page sequence="24">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS Z47 LABORATORY MANUAL FOR GENERAL BAC- TERIOLOGY. Second Edition. Compiled by George L. Peltier, Carl E.

This manual, a second edition of a I938 publication, is concise and comprehensive. There are 57 exercises in all, but the authors intend that the instructor shall make his own selection to suit the partic- ular needs of his class. In this way the manual can be used for classes primarily interested in agriculture, home economics, or sanitary engineering, or for general or pre-medical groups. Descriptive charts, formulae for stains and media, and a bibliography are included. AN ILLUSTRATED MANUAL OF CALIFORNIA SHRUBS. By Howard E. McMinn. With a chapter on The Use of the California Shrubs in the Garden Design, by Fred H. Schumacher. f. W. Stacey, Inc., San Francisco. $5.oo. 94 X 6; xi + 689; I939. North of Tehachapi there are more flower- ing plants than in any other state, and south of them there are more than twice as many. Probably never before has a work covering all of them been under- taken-certainly no more comprehensive work is conceivable. There are 775 illustrations, a glossary, an index, a dic- tionary of taxonomic terms, and a bibliog- raphy, together covering 32. pages, also additional chapters on the ecology of wild plants and their use in the garden. All told, this is a complete work of reference, and every resident of the coast who owns his home should have a copy. CHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE RHUBARB PLANT. By Hubert B. Vickery, George W. Pucher, Alfred J. Wakeman and Charles S. Leaven- worth. Connecticut Agricultural Experi- ment Station, New Haven. Bulletin 424. 2.5 cents. 9 x 6; I57; I939 (paper). Parts I and II of this Bulletin give the details of separate experiments carried out with rhubarb leaves collected in two suc- cessive years from the same farm. The results of the analyses of these leaves, cul- tured in darkness and in light, are dis- cussed in terms of chemical mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the reactions that may take place in leaf tissues. An interpretation of the data in terms of modern views of plant metabolism has been attempted in Part III. The text is supplemented by numerous tables and there is a complete index. VEGETABLE CROPS. Third Edition. By Homer C. Thompson. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $5.oo. 9 x 6; xi + 578; I939. In this edition have been incorporated all the important advances which have been made in the application of scientific facts and principles to the successful production of vegetables and the successful handling of the products since the second edition was issued in I930. This has frequently involved much revision, especially in such subjects as fertilizer practices, soil reac- tion, the use of minor or trace elements to control malnutrition troubles, the control of diseases and insects and the packaging, handling, and storage of vegetables. SUPPLEMENT TO ROOT NODULE BACTERIA AND LEGUMINOUS PLANTS. By Edwin B. Fred, Ira L. Baldwin and Elizabeth McCoy. University of Wiscon- sin Press, Madison. 5o cents. Io4 x 63; 40; I939 (paper). To supplement the bibliography of I073 titles in the original volume of Root Nodue Bacteria and Leguminous Plants (Q. R. B., Vol. VIII, p. zz8) the authors have compiled a new list of: (a) 49 titles omitted in the monograph; and b) 48z titles of new literature. The supplement also cites 39 errata in the original mono- graph, and presents two additional in- dices; one to scientific plant names, and the other to author citations.</page><page sequence="25">248 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ORCHIDS OF MICHIGAN.

Stanford Univer- sity Press, Stanford University, Calif.; Oxford University Press, London. $6.oo. x6; xv + 367 + 58 plates; t 939. Possibly no other branch of biology has had its history so well presented in our day as embryology; certainly no other branch has a written history which so interestingly displays the errant ways of man in his pursuit of knowledge. In evidence, the latest contribution of Ar- thur William Meyer may be offered. It aims to trace the growth of embryological ideas, beginning with the ideas on genera- tion held by primitive peoples, and pro- gressing through the ideas ofscholars, both early and late, in order to try to discover "why our intellectual ancestors should have been led to entertain views which strike us as absurd" [the words were Huxley's]. If to review past error is one way to avoid future absurdity, this book should be required reading for science students. So, too, the Quarterly Review of Biology asserted on the occasion of an earlier publication of Meyer. For students of preformation and epigenesis, the present work is indispensable. A LABORATORY MANUAL OF VERTEBRATE EMBRYOLOGY. Anatomy of Selected Emnbryos of the Frog, Chick, and Pig. By F. B. Adamstone and Waldo Shum- way. John Wiley and Sons, New York; Chapman and Hall, London. $i.2.5. ii x 83; vii + 87; I939 (paper). The interpretation of serial sections is always difficult for the beginning student of microscopical anatomy; and the dif- ficulty is not overcome by drawing a few individual and supposedly representative sections. This new manual outlines a more promising method, as used at the University of Illinois. There the student of vertebrate embryology is required to make only informal sketches in the mar- ginal spaces provided in his laboratory manual, but he is required to study all of the sections in any given series, to identify the structures in them, and to learn to</page><page sequence="26">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 149 recognize them by means of their diag- nostic features and their relation to each other. ANATOMY OF THE SHEEP'S BRAIN. A Laboratory Atlas for Students of Zoology. By E. A. Briggs. Angus and Robertson, Sydney. 6s. net. 83 x 54; xiii + 50 + 8 plates; I939. This brief text and the accompanying il- lustrations are designed primarily for students pursuing a junior course of practical zoology. The structures de- scribed can all be observed with the un- aided eye, and the statements have been so formulated as to guide the dissector in making his own observations. No attempt has been made to provide the student with a comprehensive account of all the structural details which he will encounter in a complete dissection of his specimen. The descriptive matter is in- tended to serve as an introduction to the study of the principal points of interest in the mammalian brain. The book con- tains a detailed index and also a group of eight excellently-drawn and well-labeled plates which greatly enhance the value of the text as a laboratory manual. THE ANATOMY OF THE BULL FROG. By Richard R. Stuart. Denoyer-Geppert Co., Chicago. 5o cents. ii x 82; 30; I939 (paper). These thirty-three original drawings made by the author from his dissections of the bull frog, Rana catesbiana, should be of excellent visual aid to the beginner in the study of frog anatomy. The drawings are good-sized and simply labeled. As all directions and descriptions are omitted the drawings should be used with at least one descriptive text. The manual is divided into three sections of drawings- skeletal, muscular, and internal. There is a name index. GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF THE ANATOMY OF THE SHARK, THE NECTURUS, AND THE CAT. By Samuel Eddy, Clarence P. Oliver and John P. Turner. John Wiley and Sons, New York; Chapman and Hall, London. $I.50. 9 X 6; vii + IOO; I939 (paper). This manual is designed primarily for the course in comparative vertebrate anatomy given at the University of Minnesota, where the type forms are dissected in succession. Because of time limitations, less detailed studies are made on some or- gan-systems than on others, the muscular and skeletal systems being especially ab- breviated. PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY HEALT H IN HANDCUFFS. By John A. Kingsbury. Modern Azie Books, New York. 75 cents. 73 X ix + 2IO; I939 (paper). This is a very well written and compre- hensive piece of propagandizing on behalf of socialized health insurance. This is not to be confused with socialized medi- cine. The latter implies universal free medical service supported by general taxation, and seems just as radical a de- parture for today as our present socialized public school system did when first initiated. But there is nothing very radical about insurance against impairment of health, or rather the loss caused by it. We can already insure against loss by a multitude of other calamities-flood, fire, light- ning, theft, etc., and can purchase dis- ability benefits from many life insurance companies. In many parts of this country the hospi- tals are so far apart and the resident physi- cians so few that insurance providing for hospitalization and medical care has no practical value. To remedy this the Wagner National Health Bill (S. i62a) has been introduced into the Senate. This would provide for government estab- lishment of hospitals where needed and their maintenance, so that their ad- vantages would be readily available to all at a reasonable charge. Opposition to this bill has come chiefly from the Ameri- can Medical Association-the group who would probably benefit most from its passage, for under it the income of the</page><page sequence="27">150 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY physician would be guaranteed, competi- tion would be eliminated, as well as the necessity for the physician to feel the patient's purse as well as his pulse before diagnosing his case and prescribing treat- ment.

Insects have been intensively stud- ied, and numerous books have appeared on their economic importance, life his- tories, taxonomy, and recently their morphology. All the experimental re- search on their physiology, however, has been published in scattered journals, and while much work has been done in this field, no one has ever synthesized the results. There are in all twelve chapters dealing with the integument, growth, the various organ systems, metabolism, water, and temperature. After each chapter there is an extensive bibliography, so that al- together over zooo titles are cited. The fact that insects are so varied in kinds and habits makes it necessary to define which creature it is that a particular statement applies to; consequently the text is heavily loaded with generic names. This book is of great importance to biologists generally. Research workers using insects as subjects of experimenta- tion will attain more precise methods with a sound background in insect physiology. It will also fill a great want for economic entomologists, who in attempting insect control need a knowledge of their physiol- ogy in order to strike at the phase in the life cycle that is most vulnerable. A generous number of illustrations and an index add to the value of this impor- tant contribution to zoology. HORMONES IN INVERTEBRATES. By Bertil Hanstrom. Oxford University Press, New York; The Clarendon Press, Oxford. $4.2.5. 84x 521; ix + i98 + I3 plates; I939. As recently as I933 the existence of definite endocrine substances and endocrine pro- ducing organs in invertebrates was denied by many investigators. In this excellent treatise Hanstrom has presented a most convincing account not only of the exist- ence of hormones in invertebrates, but also of the specific effects of a number of them on both vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as the effects of various vertebrate hormones on invertebrate organisms. Koller's classification of invertebrate hor- mones, i.e., (i) 'Zellhormone', (2) 'aglan- dulire Gewebshormone', and (3) 'glan- dulire Gewebshormone', is considered by the author to be logical and useful in discussing the problem, and the subject matter of the volume has been developed along these three lines. The range of material includes the recent work on the hormones influencing sex, reproduction, metamorphosis, and color change in a wide variety of invertebrate organisms. The text is carefully organized and well written in clear English. Numerous il- lustrations pertinent to the subject have been included. The indices of (i) authors, (z) scientific names, and (3) general subject matter, as well as the list of 86o bibliographic references add considerably to the value of this volume as a reference book. THE VASOMOTOR SYSTEM IN ANOXIA AND ASPHYXIA. A Study of the Adjustment Reactions of the Mammalian Organism. By Ernst Gellhorn and Edward H. Lam- bert. University of Illinois Press, Urbana. $i.0o (paper); $i.5o (cloth). ii x 8; 7I; I939. This study deals with the effect of various gas mixtures (i to iO percent oxygen and 4 to IS percent C02) on the blood pressure of dogs anaesthetized with sodium amytal, sodium barbital, or chloralosane. Among the significant results are the following: Under conditions in which carbon dioxide and oxygen deficiency cause a rise in blood pressure, i.e., in the normal dog with and without artificial respira- tion, and further after vagotomy or removal of both carotid sinus areas with artificial respiration, the effect of carbon dioxide plus low oxygen tension is</page><page sequence="28">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 25I greater than corresponds to the algebraic sum of the individual effects. In the dog deprived completely of its buffer nerves and artificially ventilated, it is found that carbon dioxide completely offsets the fall of blood pressure produced by the inhalation of a gas with a low oxygen tension. The experiments indicate that the cause of this potentiation lies in the fact that the effect of carbon dioxide is increased in anoxia. This is in part due to the weakening of the carotid sinus pressor reflexes. In addition to that it is assumed that the intracellular metabolites formed during short periods of anoxia may interact with the effects of carbon dioxide and thereby cause the potentiating effect described above. There is a bibliography of I52 titles. THE STATISTICS OF PULMONARY TUBER- CULOSIS IN DENMARK I92.5-I934. A statis- tical investigation on the occurrence of pul- monary tuberculosis in the period I925f-I934, worked out on the basis of the Danish National Health Service file of notified cases and of deaths. By Marie Lindhardt. Einar Mmnksgaard, Copenhagen. Kr. 8. I:02 X 7; I79 + I folding table; I939 (paper). The present investigation was undertaken on the basis of the file of consumptives kept by the Danish National Health Service. These tuberculosis notifications, which since i92.0 have been regularly treated statistically, have been collected under a rational filing system since I92.5. The present investigation comprises 39,379 notifications of new cases received by the National Health Service between I92.5 and I934, and 2.0,I73 notifications of deaths occurring in the same period. In this report the distribution of tubercu- losis in various parts of the country according to age, sex, civil status, etc., and its nature, duration, lethality, sea- sonal fluctuations, and incidence within various groups are thoroughly discussed and illustrated with numerous graphs and tables. Supplementary tables are in- cluded in the appendix, and there is an extensive bibliography. THE VITAMINS. A Symposium Arranged Under the Auspices of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry and the Council on Foods of the American Medical Association. American Medical Associa#tion, Chicago. $i.5o. 84 x 52; 637; I939. VITAMIN D. Chemistry, Physiology, Phar- iacology, Pathology, Experimental and Clin- ical Investigations. 13y C. 1. Reed, H. C. Struck and 1. E. Steck. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $4.50. 9 X 6; xviii + 389; 1939. A good summary of a field of work, and a detailed report on any part of that field are always of value. These two books are admirable examples. The vitamin sym- posium, arranged under the auspices of the American Medical Association, numbcred 30 authorities among its participants; it presents a digest of what is known about each vitamin. This book gives the reader a fairly comprehensive idea of the impor- tance of vitamin therapy in modern medicine. The second book is a resume of what is known about Vitamin D, and a working report from a laboratory active in its study. Scientists, teachers, industrialists, druggists, and physicians will find this a dependable reference. Both books are careful to make it clear that the field of vitamin study is far from being worked- out, and that there is much to be done before what is known can be applied to best advantage. DIE FUNKTION DER NEBENNIERENRINDE. By F. Ve,t.4r. Benno Schwabe and Co., Basel. 25 Swiss francs. 83 x 6; z66; I939. In this attractively printed volume the professor of physiology in the University of Basel presents a comprehensively thor- ough, critical review and synthesis of the literature on the function of the adrenal cortex, in which the results of his own important work in this field are clearly set forth and brought into their proper place in the general picture. It is now certain that cortin, the hormone of the adrenal cortex, is a substance of fundamental im- portance in the metabolism of the cell generally. Lack of this hormone starts a train of changes in fat metabolism, and in carbohydrate formation in the cell that lead finally to failure of heat regulation, of selective glucose resorption, of glycogen formation in the liver, of K elimination</page><page sequence="29">2.52. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY by the kidney, loss of plasma from the blood, and death. In its logical, clear, and concise elucida- tion of an extremely complicated field this book is a masterpiece. The bibliography, set in the most condensed form, occupies 30 pages and covers the literature to I939. A valuable addition to any biological library. STUDIES IN THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE KID- NEY. Porter Lectures, Series IX. Dc- livered at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. By Homer W. Smith. University Exten- sion Division, University of Kansas, Law- rence. $i.oO. 88 x 54; [6] + io6; I939. The first lecture in this series is concerned with the physiological bases of recently developed methods for examining the normal and diseased kidney, such as functional methods of measuring the glomerular filtrations, the renal blood flow, and the quantity of intact, active glomerular and tubular tissue. In the second lecture the general evolutionary history of the vertebrates is discussed with special reference to the kidney of fishes. The final lecture on the renal blood flow in normal and hypertensive subjects, deals largely with experimental work, such as the effect on renal function of various substances (oil of juniper, adrenin, ephed- rine), vasodilatation of the renal ar- terioles, relationship of renal arterioles and the nervous system. In this section is given a chart "summarizing the more important data in renal function as found in IS hypertensive subjects." A number of diagrams and figures will be found in the volume, each lecture is well documented, but no index has been pro- vided. THE FLOWERING OF AN IDEA. A Play Presenting the Origin and Early Development of The Johns Hopkins Hospital. By Alan M. Chesney. The Johns Hot- kins Press, Baltimore. $I.SO. 82 x 52; 87; I939. Written for the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of The Johns Hopkins Hospital, the story of this play centers about the origin, early develop- ment and formal opening of the hospital. The play, in four scenes, is admirably adapted for just such a formal occasion. The first scene, wherein an imaginary conversation takes place between Johns Hopkins and George Peabody concerning the uses to which they intend to put their money, gives the author a chance to show the interesting personalities of these two men. The dialogue throughout the play seems somewhat stilted, but this stiffness of style is partly a true characteristic of the times portrayed, and partly to be attributed to the fact that, with the ex- ception of the first scene, official records and documents were closely followed. ZOOLOGICA. Scientific Contributions of the New York Zoilogical Society. Volume XXIV, Part 3, Numbers IO-26. New York Zoological Society, Zo3logical Park, New York. $2..oo. IO2 X 7; i2o + 22 plates; 1939 (paper). This issue of Zoologica reads much like a number of the Journal of the American Medical Association and for this reason we have put this review in "Physiology and Pathology". Of the I7 papers, I4 form the bulk of the report of the Hospital and Laboratory of the New York Zoological Park for I938. The first number gives a resume of the causes of death in the col- lection. As a basis for this, the In- ternational Classification of Causes of Death adopted for man by an International Committee in i929 is used, although some modification has been necessary to exclude those diseases to which animals are im- mune and to include those diseases which attack only animals. Other papers deal with carcinoma of the pancreas in a bear, goiter in a dromedary, dental pathology, parasites of wild rats, Multiceps serialis infestation in a baboon, amoebic dysen- tery in an orang-utan, etc. All of the papers carry bibliographic references and many excellent photographs add to the interest of the texts.</page><page sequence="30">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 253 PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF AVIATION MEDICINE. By Harry G. Armstrong. Williams 7 Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $6.So. 9 x 6; xii + 496; I939. Progress in aviation has been accompanied by the increased realization that new kinds of medical problems arise from the unusual environment in which the flier finds him- self. To deal particularly with such problems a specialized branch of medicine is now in the process of being definitely formed. The author has brought together and examines in this volume most of the available literature on the several phases of the subject. The first nine chapters are concerned with the selection of pilots, the physical and psychic require- ments they should possess, the standards of examination used in this and other countries. The remaining twenty-nine chapters deal with the evidence so far collected on the physiological, psycho- logical and pathological manifestations associated with flying. Although neces- sarily sketchy in parts the book covers well the whole vast range of the subject and contains an excellent bibliography. NUTRITION AND DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. Third Edition, Entirely Rewritten. By James S. McLester. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia and London. $8.oo. 91 x 6; 838; I939. In the twelve years which have elapsed since the first appearance of this book ''newer discoveries have been so far reaching and the changes in the point of view so extreme" that it has been neces- sary completely to rewrite this edition. Only occasional paragraphs have been retained, such as those dealing with Sippy's method of treating peptic ulcers. A relatively large amount of space has been given to the nature and physiologic influences of the several nutritive sub- stances and to the discussions of disordered physiology. Part I deals with nutrition in health (3 sections, 3 I4 pages); Part II, with nutrition in disease (436 pages); Part TIT, appendix (ca. 6o pages) contains considerable tabular matter. The volume is thoroughly documented and indexed. Teachers and practicing -physicians will find this a dependable guide. LIQUOR, THE SERVANT OF MAN. By Walton Hall Smith and Ferdinand C. Helwig. Little, Brown and Co., Boston. $z.oo. 8 x 53; [41 + 273; I939. This volume presents a sound and un- biassed review of much of the more im- portant scientific work that has been done on the biological effects of alcohol. The style of writing will probably offend some readers, for the same kind of reason that baby-talk from aged spinsters is irritating to some people. But leaving this aside, the reader of this book, which is the product of the collaboration of a professional writer and a pathologist, will get a just picture of what is presently known about the ways and degrees in which alcohol affects physiological, psy- chological, and pathological processes in man. Much of it will be new, even to the biologist who has not himself actually worked in this field. The book has no index, which is a pity, because its or- ganization lacks that kind of precision that might help in using it for reference purposes in the absence of an index. AN INTRODUCTION TO MEDICAL MYCOLOGY. By George M. Lewis and Mary E. Hopper. Year Book Publishers, Chicago. $5.50. IO x 7; xviii + 3I5; I939. This text has been designed to give the student a substantial knowledge of the important phases of mycology and of the common fungus diseases. The charac- teristics and habits of the habitual fungus parasites are briefly but clearly described. Since the pathogenic flora varies in dif- ferent parts of the world, "our emphasis on certain fungi as important in New York may not apply to the same degree in other localities." The first part deals with clinical, theoretical and experimental as- pects of the subject; the second, with lab- oratory procedures useful in examining a</page><page sequence="31">2.54 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY patient suspected of having one of the various mycoses.

THE JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY. Vol- ume I, Number I. Edited by E. C. Dodds. Oxford Univer- sity Press, London and New York. Sub- scription price: 30s. or $6.oo. IO x 61; i i6; I939 (paper). This new quarterly is founded to bring together and to make available in a single British journal papers in the English language concerning "the internally se- creting glands, the mode of their actions, the nature of their secretions, and the disorders of their functions." Contribu- tions from all countries will be welcome. Papers intended for publication should be submitted to the editors at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry, Middlesex Hos- pital, London, W. I. The editorial board includes P. M. F. Bishop, C. R. Haring- ton, G. F. Marrian, A. S. Parkes, F. G. Young, and S. Zuckerman. THE ENDOCRINE GLANDS. By Max A. Goldzieher. D. Appleton- Century Co., New York and London. $IO.OO. 92 X 62; xvi + 96I; I939. It is the announced aim of this book to discuss systematically and thoroughly, and on the basis of first-hand information, both the theoretical and the practical aspects of endocrinology, and to abstract from the enormous literature the really important contributions which have a bearing on the practice of the clinician. Endocrinology is still a very rapidly changing field, of course. The author has not always succeeded in passing un- prejudiced judgment on which contribu- tions are clinically most important. He has succeeded single-handed, however, in marshalling a prodigious array of de- tailed matter in a masterly fashion. A selected bibliography follows each chap- ter. HYDROPHTHALMIA OR CONGENITAL GLAU- COMA: ItS Causes, Treatment, and Outlook. By J. Ringland Anderson. With a Fore- word by Sir John Herbert Parsons. The University Press, Cambridge; The Mac- millan Co., New York. $7.00. 93 x 6; XX + 377; I939. The last monograph on this subject was published in I897. This book will there- fore serve as a summary of the literature for the practicing ophthalmic surgeon. The first portion of the work deals with the pathology, morphology, and diag- nosis of the disease. The remainder of the book is given over to methods of treatment and surgical techniques. Each chapter has appended a long bibliography of titles down to I938. The tables in- serted in the back cover of the book con- tain the data for each case discussed in the text. The work is well illustrated. HUMAN HELMINTHOLOGY. A Manua I for Physicians, Sanitarians and Medical Zoolo- gists. Second Edition, Thoroughly Revised. By Ernest C. Faust. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia. $8.So. 94 x 6; 780; I939. This excellent and exhaustive presentation of the science of helminthology by one who for many years has been a teacher and investigator in the field first appeared ten years ago (cf. Q. R. B., Vol. 5, p. 248). In this second edition, new illustrations have been added, bringing the total to 30Z, and old ones have been revised and clarified. A new chapter on "Anthelmin- tics and Their Use" has been included, and the terminology in the book has been brought up-to-date. The extensive bib- liography is placed at the end instead of being included in the individual chapters. There is both an author and subject index. AN INTRODUCTION TO GASTRO-ENTEROL- OGY.

Pitman Publishing Corp., New York and Chicago. $.50o. 98 x 68; [51 + 3IS; I939. This book comprises the lectures of several well-known statisticians and mathema- ticians on the subject of control of quality and standardization of product in indus- trial plants; also the application of statis- tical methods to research in medicine and various other fields. It is obvious that statistical control of the quality of raw materials, the behavior of machinery, etc. in large industrial plants is necessary for a more or less thorough understanding of what is taking place. It inevitably leads to better finished products, and better methods of production, which of course reduces the percentage of rejection and leads to lower cost to the consumer. The lectures in this book explain clearly the present value and future possibilities of the use of statistics in the manufactur- ing world, draw attention to methods of analysis of scientific data, and also illus- trate somewhat to the uninitiated the use of statistics as the safe method of proving</page><page sequence="33">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY a fact or exploding a fallacy.

Brinton Asso- ciates, New York. $5.oo. 9 x 6; Si2; I939. For many years Brinton has been the leading authority in this country on the graphic representation of statistical data. His Graphic Methods (i9i4) is the standard text on the subject. It is doubtful that the present volume will add greatly to his reputation. It is, in essence, a mod- ernized, stream-lined, and somewhat jazzed-up re-treatment of the material, obviously influenced by present-day graphic technique in the advertising field. While every statistician will want it at hand for reference and student use, it will not wholly replace the author's earlier text. Free use of color, and great originality and ingenuity in the make-up and arrangement, make it a striking book. It is well indexed, and thoroughly docu- mented throughout.

Editions Stock, Paris. xS francs 72 x S1; 306; 1939 (paper). Some years ago there was mention in these columns of a contemplated treatise on The Natural History of Copulation, to be published in elephant folio abundantly illustrated with plates in the best tradi- tion of zoological publication in the good old days. The present volume contributes to this worthy project by furnishing ready-made a text for the treatise, written with the sort of clarity and charming grace that French writers seem to command so much more frequently than those of other countries. The general editor of the volume is Jean Rostand, who is probably the world's foremost popularizer of biology today, taking the whole range of pertinent values into account. Associated with him in the production of the volume are such well-known zoologists as Lucien Berland, who does the sections on the crustaceans, arachnids, and insects; L. Bertrand (fish); F. Angel (reptiles); J. Berlioz, who shares the section on birds with Jacques Delamain and Jean de Bosschere; Andree Martignon, Jean-Emile Benech, Denyse de Stampa, G. Petit, E. Gromier, Marquis de Barthelemy, and Dr. Laurent, who between them take care of the love life of the mammals. M. Rostand, in addition to a delightful preface, does the sections on the infusoria, worms, molluscs, and batrachians. The book is characterized by the ut- most delicacy of language, but what it is all about is copulation, and nothing much else. It is extremely well done. While</page><page sequence="34">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS intended for the general reader of the lay public, the professional biologist will find it an excellent review and digest of the main features of an interesting section of the animal behavior field. Space is lacking to discuss particular points in any detail. The statement is made that while the preliminary courtship behavior of whales has been fairly fre- quently observed, their actual copulatory act has probably never been seen. A sketchy and not altogether satisfactory or convincing account is given of a single observation of the copulatory behavior of wild elephants in the wild. This has been very rarely observed; some experienced men who have devoted their lives to the study of elephant behavior say never. The volume is well indexed and can be recommended as an addition to any bio- logical library. LOVE PROBLEMS OF ADOLESCENCE. By Oliver M. Butterfield. Emerson Books, New York. $z.zS. 9 x 6; viii + 'iz; I939. Some iioo youths of both sexes ranging in age from I3 to 2S years listed, on request, the sex and matrimonial problems about which they desired information. The youths belonged to 24 separate organiza- tions, the majority being under the aus- pices of Protestant churches. The inquiry shows that the questions most frequently asked regarded the propriety of juvenile heterosexual relations such as kissing and petting, while those relative to the ad- visability of establishing boy and girl friendships when there are differences in age and education were encountered with the least frequency. However, as can be expected due to the wide age range among the subjects, there is a considerable variation from group to group in the type of questions asked. The author discusses the results as indications of the need for more education in matters of sex relations and sex hygiene. He concludes: We live in an age of educational and factual abundance but we appear to suffer great privation from a poor distribution of its resources. The hope for improve- ment lies in attacking the situation all along the line with special stress upon the training of parents. Pre- marita and post-marital adult education can take up much of the lag and thus in the next generation greatly reduce the present perplexities due to ig- norance. This type of reasoning is based on the false premise which identifies theoretical with practical knowledge and culture with wisdom. Lectures and books cannot solve the immediate perplexities of a I3-year-old first adventuring into sex relations, no more than it can for one first attempting to drive an automobile or a train. Is it possible that the educators have not yet realized the implications of the methods of Montessori and of Froebel which they have accepted? WOMEN AND MARRIAGE IN INDIA. By P. Thomas. George Allen and Unwin, London. 7S. 6d. net 74 x 5; 2--4; I939. With all the fire and heat of a igth century militant suffragette the author attacks the marriage system in India and the moral theology on which it is based. To the complaisant subjection of the woman are ascribed the current ills of the country and the lack of competent leader- ship. Therefore, if India is to take its place in the sun the status of the woman and the prevalent form of social rela- tionship between the sexes must be altered. The author advocates a number of reforms including the abolishment of child marriages, the establishment of the right to divorce, greater freedom of con- tact between the sexes, and their equality in all matters even to include the right of the wife to half of her husband's pay. Such views sound reasonable from the standpoint of our civilization and one ordinarily would be ready to cheer on the efforts to bring about such reforms. It is unfortunate, however, that this book does not evoke sympathy-due to the author's vituperative style and strange concepts of Western customs. It seems that among other objectionable qualities the Indian husbands spend a good deal of their time at home. In a characteristic manner the author assails violently such habits as the following:</page><page sequence="35">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Whenever the robust European woman finds her husband too home-loving or sentimental, she manages to nag him into his club or the cricket-field. But her Indian sister is too much a Pathivrita to do anything of the sort. She stands dutifully on the balcony from 5 P.M. onwards, watching her lord come home from office, tries to smile and look pleasant when he comes, proceeds to undress him, puts him to bed, presses his lean limbs and long head, feeds him out of her hand, and generally makes him the voluptuous imbecile he is. Many of the children produced in these homes are morons ending up in the street or on the banks of the Ganges. LES HERMAPHRODITES ET LA CHIRURGIE. By L. Ombredanne. Masson et Cie, Paris. 85 francs. io x 62; 32.2.; 1939 (paper). In the case of hermaphroditism when should the surgeon intervene for corrective purposes and on the basis of what criteria should he decide to increase either the masculine or feminine appearance? These problems constitute the main theme of this volume which includes also a general survey of hermaphroditism in its em- bryological, morphological and physio- logical aspects. However, the major portion of the book is devoted to the clinical and pathological variations of persons with (a) male gonads and external feminine appearance and (b) female gon- ads and external masculine appearance. He considers also the question of the marriage of such persons and the views of the law and of moral theology on the subject. In great detail he describes twenty-two cases he himself observed, their personal history, the operative findings, and the reasons for the particular procedure he followed. He apparently believes that no attempt at correction should be made until puberty is passed and then surgery should usually be em- ployed to change the form of the external genitalia so that they agree with the sex of the gonads. However, as he illus- trates with his own material, there are often cases in which it is impossible or unwise to follow this rule and then the operator is legally and morally justified to change the genitalia so that they har- monize with the patient's external so- matic appearance, psychic reactions and desires. ATTAINING WOMANHOOD. A Doctor Talks to Girls About Sex. By George W. Corner. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $I.00. 7A x 44; xiii + 95; I939. Dr. Corner again "rings the bell" with this little volume for adolescent girls. Like its companion forerunner, Attaining Manhood, the facts of life are presented in simple, non-technical language, yet ac- curacy and clearness is maintained. This is a good example of how the simple truth, neither brutally frank nor evasive, can easily furnish an answer to that parental bugbear, the baffling question of what and how the children shall be taught about sex. PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR BEYOND THE CLINICAL FRONTIERS. A Psy- chiatrist Views Crowd Behavior. By Edward A. Strecker. W. W. Norton and Co., New York. $z.oo. 8x 5;zio; I940. There seems to be something of a trend at the present time for the clinical psy- chiatrist, with his experience in the intra- individual chaos presented by the psy- choses and psychoneuroses, to extend his authority to the international situation with its chaos between individuals en masse, and to attempt to analyze the latter in terms of the former. There is a certain validity in such a critical evalua- tion, if not too much is said and the analogy is not drawn beyond the facts. Such an evaluation is attempted in this book, which comprises the Salmon Lec- tures for I939, by Dr. Strecker, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Penn- sylvania. Outlining the similarities be- tween the behavior of the normal indi- vidual, the mentally ill individual and the crowd or mass-man, he draws a parallel between the short-circuiting of reality by the psychotic and the mob, "Unquestionably, the world is sick- mentally sick," he states, and the tempta- tion to ignore the checks of the intelligent minority and to utilize the escape tech- nique of the crowd mind is becoming</page><page sequence="36">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS stronger. In recruiting intelligent minor- ities who will be effective in holding the balance of power and effecting satisfactory compromises when conflicts with the primitive forces of the mass-man arise, lies Strecker's hope for civilization. This, he thinks, can be accomplished only through a broad extension of the prin- ciples and practices of mental hygiene. His observations are perspicacious and succinctly put, and the fact that they are platitudinous is perhaps inescapable. The lectures were perhaps better heard than read: this reviewer found the rather ran- dom arrangement of the material and case extracts into loose paragraphs dis- tracting. The significance of this book would seem to be in its place as part of the trend towards an ultimate understanding of crowd behavior in terms of human personality. WAR AND PEACE. Essays in Psychological Analysis. By William Brown. A. and C. Black, London. 5s. net. 72 x 58 XVi + 93 I939. This book by the English psychiatrist, William Brown, was written in the spring of I939, after the peace of Munich but before the actual outbreak of war in Europe. It is understandable that, at so critical a time as this, this philosophi- cally-minded physician who had seen active service during the four years of the last war should feel impelled to express his views on the basis for and prevention of war. He does so in this small book of seven chapters, each a short essay empha- sizing a particular feature of the central thesis that war is implicitly determined and the result of primitive aggressiveness and hostility repressed in the depths of the unconscious. mind. Logically, there- fore, the problem of avoiding war is to find adequate sublimation for these tend- encies. This general thesis is developed by the author in a rather platitudinous and rambling fashion which does not come to any constructive point. The suggestion that all public leaders increase their self-knowledge, presumably through psychoanalysis, is made. The author affirms his faith in Prime Minister Cham- berlain and in a newLeague of Nations. Peace, he states, will be reached "only by a deep analysis followed by a process of sublimation wherein the ideals of different nations may combine in the one ideal- a super-national ideal of free cultural and spiritual development of all human beings, whatever their nationality, each within his own national sphere and environ- ment." INTELLIGENCE AND CRIME. A Study of Penitentiary and Reformatory Offenders. By Simon H. Tulchin. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $2.oo. 9 x 6; xiii + i66; I939. This monograph presents the results ob- tained from intelligence tests administered to over io,OOO inmates of 3 Illinois penal institutions during the years i920-27. The same procedure and the same tests as those given by the army to draft recruits were employed in this study so that the data on the Illinois recruits could be used for comparative purposes. The main find- ing is that, on the whole and also when nativity and race (color) of the prisoner are taken into consideration, the intel- ligence scores of the criminals do not differ appreciably from those of the recruits. When the criminals are segre- gated according to type of crime com- mitted, the highest score, on the average, was made by those who committed fraud while the score was lowest for sex crim- inals. This is to be expected. The author has also analyzed the data in terms of age, nativity, race (color), education, height and weight and the results are similar to the findings of others. Of interest and apparently inexplicable for the author are the higher scores of the recidivists when compared to first-termers. Maybe the intelligence is here manifest by the ability to get a short prison sen- tence or an early release from prison. Although the statistical presentation of the results is not of the best, these findings certainly do not reinforce the position of those that believe that education can</page><page sequence="37">26o THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY eliminate crime or that criminals are all feeble-minded. MIND EXPLORERS. By John K. Winkler and Walter Bromberg. Reynal and Hitchcock, New York. $3.00. 8x X 5 4; [4] + 378; I939. The development of psychology as a science, and of psychiatry, from the i8th century when interest in human nature first became widespread and objective to the present day, is presented in this book in a series of excellent biographic sketches of the investigators whose contributions and influence have been most significant. With a chapter each devoted to the more dramatic Gall and Mesmer, it is to be regretted that the brilliant treatises of the still earlier students, Locke, Hume, and Bentham are not mentioned. How- ever, the names selected provide a compre- hensive survey of important advances on many fronts: Pinel, Eli Todd, Charcot, Francis Galton, William James, Stanley Hall, Cattell, Terman, Yerkes, Thorndike, Lashley, Watson, Freud, Adolf Meyer, and Clifford Beers. The contributions of each of these men as a logical outcome of his own personality and experience makes fascinating! reading, and the interlocking of influence from man to man and country to country welds the mass of information into an intelligible historical whole. The book gives a clear, critically well- evaluated formulation of the genetic- dynamic development of the rapidly ex- panding sciences of human personality function. There is a short, well-selected list of important references. THE MIND OF THE BEES. By Julien Franfon. Translated by H. Eltringham. Methuen and Co., London. 6s. net. 74 x 54; xi -1I-46; I939. Most of the studies on insect behavior have been confined to the laboratory where conditions are likely to be just about as unnatural as possible. This, however, is not the case in this excellent study of bees by M. Fran?on. Many years of field observation and ingenious experimentation in nature have convinced the author that the bees have a remarkable ability to communicate to one another pre- cise directions as to the position and availability of certain materials valuable for the production of honey. M. Fran- ?on also believes that the economy of the hive is such that extra workers may be regimented at a moment's notice when the value of the "find" seems to warrant it, and that the number of extras put on the job is accurately proportioned in relation to the distance from the hive, and the quality of such a "find". The book is clearly and simply written. It will be read with great interest, not only by bee-keepers, but also by entomolo- gists in general whose interests lie in the field of animal behavior. THE LIFE AND DEATH INSTINCTS (The Vita and the Fatum). By Arthur N. Foxe. The Monograph Editions, 25 West s4th St., New York. $2.oo. 8 x S 2; 64; I939. In this rambling, verbose little volume, Dr. Foxe purports to offer a psycho- analytic examination of the vita and the fatum. At least three etiological factors are alleged to be involved in the forma- tion of the criminoses:-a severe trauma sustained in infancy or early childhood, a real want or need that cannot be satisfied in the home, and the hidden participation of other members of the family in the criminotic behavior. The author also expresses himself concerning chance and determinism, war and peace, transference and recognizance, and the interplay of the vita, the libido, and the fatum. There is a bibliography, but no index. DE OMNIBUS REBUS ET QUIBUSDEM ALIIS MODERN SCIENCE. A Study of Physical Science in the World Today. By Hyman Levy. Diagrams by Joan Samuell. Alfred A. Knopf, New York. $5.oo. 92 x 64; x + 736; 1939.</page><page sequence="38">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 6i Within the last i5 years a succession of books has appeared, each, as Prof. Levy points out, more startling than the pre- vious, in which science is presentec in mysterious garb. This has been to in- vert its true purpose. If science means anything it entails clearing the atmos- phere by reducing it to reason and finally it and common sense to a common de- nominator. This volume has been writ- ten "to present a balanced picture of the whole . . . [and] to attempt to picture the goal towards which the present crisis is converging.' An understanding of the scheme of the book is important. Part I, The energy of man, discusses the background of social life within which science has developed. "Today the ferment among scientific men is stimu- lated by the same disillusionment as urged on the Encyclopaedists; historically, however, it must be seen as the next stage of the ferment of the seven- teeth century in this country [England]. It is dis- illusionment after the Industrial Revolution; it is the drive to advance science beyond the mere study of nature at the level of inanimate matter, to the level of men in their group activity." The new division of the British Association "to explore the social rela- tions of science is a step in the rational process of paving the way to the new society." Part II deals with the coming of the machine and attempts to explain and clarify the general ideas which were the outgrowths of this phase. "It shows how the mind of man was affected in its thinking by the machine he was creat- ing." Part III discusses "groups or systems of things, ideas, events that can be made to show a pattern or an orderliness in their arrangements." It treats of the historical development and use of numbers, and "the struggle for mental freedom and expres- sion in mathematical form." This sec- tion, which concludes with The language and measurement of movement-:-the cal- culcus, and problems of the calculus, will have special significance for the mathema- tician. The headings of the last four parts are: Newtonian laws; The perfec- tion of shape [one of the chapter headings of this section is Shaking off the past.- The sad story of Euclidean geometry]; What is the universe?; and The age of light; with an epilogue, Science in travail. One hundred and fifty-four diagrams aid in clarifying the text. The volume is not documented but has an adequate index. A SHORT HISTORY OF SCIENCE. By W. T. Sedgwick and H. W. Tyler. Revised by H. W. Tyler and R. P. Bigelow. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3 .75. 8x X 52; xxi + 5i2. + 9 plates; I939. This text, intended for a beginner's course in the history of science, embodies the development of scientific thought from the time of the earliest recording of ideas down to about the end of the nineteenth century. To include such a vast amount of history in one volume is an enormous task, and the discussion of any particular phase of science must of necessity be very brief. The progression of events in the physical sciences, and particularly mathe- matics, is somewhat more detailed than that of the natural sciences. The writers state specifically that there is no attempt at completeness. This fact is most severely felt in that the progres- sion of scientific ideas and discoveries is not correlated with the progression of other historical happenings. This lack of correlation in the textual material is, however, somewhat compensated by the chronological listing of some important dates, names, and events in Appendix B. Appendices A and C list, respectively, some inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and a small number of reference books in the history of science. The volume is generously illustrated and comprehensively indexed. SCIENcE TODAY AND TOMORROW. By Waldemar Kaempffert. The Viking Press, New York. $2..5o. 81 x 5; 275; I939. The advance of science up to the present day, and its possibilities for the future are clearly presented for the lay reader of this volume. The early chapters discuss the solar system, the question of its</page><page sequence="39">262- THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY origin, and the possibility of interplane- tary travel. Next the problem of power is considered. When the world's supply of coal is exhausted will we use tides, wind, sunlight? Kaempffert goes on to consider whether or not the laboratory can create life, the advances of genetics, and Carrel's work in tissue culture. Finally the rapid advances in the physical sciences are discussed and the relation of science to democracy. It is his belief that totalitarianism denies the liberty of mind which is necessary to objective research, and that in science we have the savior of democracy and the nidus of international- ism. This book is adjusted to the under- standing of the general public. Some more critical scientific minds may not rate it highly. ScIENcE siNcE I5OO. A Short History of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology. Board of Education, Science Museum. By H. T. Pledge. H. M. Stationery Office, London; British Library of Informa- tion, New York. $2..i5. 93 x 6; 357 + i6 plates; I939. This text, a history of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, is a panoramic survey of these sciences from I5OO to recent years. The study is set against a background of human and eco- nomic factors in the successive periods. Biography, as a detailed study, has been suppressed, but enough has been given to counterbalance the monotonous effect of the exposition of so many scientific dis- coveries, theories, and experiments. Par- ticularly interesting is the author's treat- ment of the microscope in science. Maps showing how the birth-places of scientists seem to cluster about certain geographical locations in particular periods and times and charts showing teacher-pupil relation- ships for the i6th to igth centuries form a very interesting piece of work. The latter relationships show how a number of noted scientists fall into a continuous teacher-pupil line; this linkage holds for the experimental and biological sciences rather than for the mathematical-mathe- maticians seeming to learn from texts, not persons. There are full-page photo- graphs, facsimiles, text drawings, and graphs. HANDBOOK OF PHOTOGRAPHY. Edited by Keith Henney and Beverly Dudley. Whittlesey House, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $7.50. 9 x 6; xii + 87I; I939. The editors of Photo Technique have pro- duced a book of great value to the pho- tographer-whether he be specialist or amateur. It comes as near being the photographer's Vade Mecum as anything that has so far appeared in print. The 2.3 contributors o sections) have ar- ranged their material in such a way that it is quickly available to the reader. How- ever, it must be said that if the very ex- cellent indexes (author and subject) were lacking this would not be the case, since the subject matter is arranged under topics-with full discussions to make all points clear. Perhaps a Vade Mecum is the next stage in development, with this book a valuable and necessary accompani- ment. We are unable in the brief space allotted to include a list of the writers but they have been chosen for their out- standing accomplishments in their par- ticular fields. A random sampling of the topics discussed yields the following: optics of photographic lenses, cameras, shutters, photographic sensitometry, pho- tographic light sources, light filters, tech- nique of development, defects in negatives, stereoscopic photography, infrared and ultraviolet photography, color photog- raphy, motion picture photography, aerial photography, high-speed photography, photomicrography, and radiography. Tables, graphs, figures and bibliographies enrich the various sections and in a group of appendices additional material not available in the body of the book is ar- ranged. PICrURES WITH A PURPOSE, How THEY ARE MADE.</page><page sequence="40">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS z63 By Charles Kerlee. Camera Craft Publish- ing Co., San Francisco. $X.5o. 0 X 81; 8o; I939 (paper). This slight volume consists of 2.4 "pictures with a purpose" or commercial photo- graphs. Each reproduction, and each is very fine of its type, is accompanied by two pages of text in which the author discusses the particular purpose of the picture in question, the main points to be brought out to accomplish this purpose and the various technicalities employed for best results. This work should be of great interest to amateur photographers who hope to turn their hobby to profit.</page></plain_text>
