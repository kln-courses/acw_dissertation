Printed in the United States of America Lutz Wiederhold LEGAL-RELIGIOUS ELITE, TEMPORAL AUTHORITY, AND THE CALIPHATE IN MAMLUK SOCIETY: CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE EXAMINATION OF A "ZAHIRI REVOLT" IN DAMASCUS IN 1386 The following study is aimed at describing social, political, and religious aspects of Mamluk society in the context of a political disturbance in Damascus in 1386. It is mainly based on historiographical and prosopographical evidence. Readers who are familiar with medieval Islamic chronicles and biographical dictionaries will know that these sources do not provide satisfactory answers to all the questions concern- ing the socio-political structure of Islamic societies as raised by modern scholarship. Nevertheless, the information collected in the course of our examination will permit us to draw conclusions concerning three major issues of Mamluk and Islamic his- tory, respectively: First, studies of the history of Mamluk Egypt and Syria sometimes describe rep- resentatives of temporal power (Mamluks) and religious scholars (ulema) as belong- ing to two separate spheres of Mamluk society.' The military elite, almost exclusively consisting of foreign elements, is presented as a group that safeguarded the state against external and internal threats by exercising force against its enemies.2 On the other hand, the mainly autochthonous ulema are described as having maintained a social and political equilibrium by settling legal conflicts among the populace and by serving as a mediator between the military rulers and the civilians.3 To a certain degree, this notion of Mamluk society seems to be the result of an increasing spe- cialization among historians and methodological problems in the interpretation of the sources: problem-oriented studies that focus exclusively on one socio-political group tend to corroborate the impression of a clear division between temporal and reli- gious authorities.4 At the same time, source-oriented studies also may fail to reflect the complex nature of the relationship between Mamluks and ulema if sources fo- cusing on one socio-political group are not put into a wider historical context or if models of social reality as provided in the works of certain medieval Egyptian- Syrian historians are taken at face value.5 Taking reference to the notion of Mamluk society as outlined earlier, this study aims to contribute to a more differentiated Lutz Wiederhold is Middle East Librarian, Universitits- und Landesbibliothek, 06098 Halle, Germany.

How- ever, this topic recently has been treated on several occasions,8 and a second main objective of this article is to extend our knowledge of these internal relationships and their relevance for the functioning of Mamluk society. Third, the historical context in which these topics will be examined is a "revolt of the Zahiris" (fitna Zahiriyya) in Damascus in 1386. To our knowledge, this fitna was brought to the attention of Western scholarship for the first time by Ignac Goldziher in his book Die Zahiriten, published in 1884. Goldziher and those who later referred to his description of the fitna did discuss the event as part of the history of Zahiri thought and the Zahiri school of law. In view of the fact that contemporary chroni- clers have described the revolt as a fitna Zahiriyya, and some of its protagonists as Zahiris, Goldziher's approach seems appropriate. However, after reading various his- toriographical and biographical accounts describing the fitna, it must be concluded that Goldziher's, as well as other, sources on this event and its protagonists do not lend themselves to a discussion of the relevance of Zahiri tenets to the legal and theo- logical discourse in 14th-century Egypt and Syria. Yet, if a discussion of the fitna does not contribute to our notion of doctrinal aspects of Zahirism, the question arises as to why the term "Zahiri" was used at all to denote the historical event concerned and some of the individuals involved. Therefore, the third main objective of this study is to provide an idea of whom and what the term "Zahiri" could have denoted at the time under examination. As a certain knowledge of Zahirism and its role in the theological and legal history of Islam might be helpful in understanding why the fitna was described as "Zahiri," the first paragraph presents to the reader a brief outline of the emergence of Zahirism as a scholarly principle and a legal school and its development up to the 14th century. Thereafter, the study provides a summary and critique of Goldziher's description of the fitna, followed by a more detailed account of the events based on a greater num- ber of sources than used by Goldziher. The third part of the text examines the biog- raphies of four Damascene ulema who were denoted as Zahiris in our sources and who, with one exception, played important roles in the fitna. Finally, in the conclud- ing remarks we attempt a synthesis of the results of our study in which our informa- tion concerning the significance of Zahirism, the relationship between members of the learned elite, and the relationship between Mamluks and ulema is hoped to merge in a coherent picture of the fitna Zahiriyya and its socio-political context. ZAHIRISM: SOME REMARKS ON ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN THE HISTORY OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT In the course of Islamic history, the majority of Muslim scholars belonging to the established Sunni schools of law (sing., madhhab) viewed the Zahiris with suspicion. As commonly accepted, this suspicion was primarily grounded on the fact that Zahiri legists refused to acknowledge any source of law except the Qur'an and the tradi-</page><page sequence="3">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 205 tion of the Prophet (sunna, hadith). In the view of the founder of the Zahiri school, Dawud ibn 'Ali al-Zahiri (d. 884),9 only the literal meaning (zahir) of these two sources formed a legitimate basis for the formulation of legal rules. As a consequence, the Zahiris considered the entire body of scholarly interpretation as laid down in the legal doctrines of the other madhhabs to be superfluous. Furthermore, they rejected individual opinions and hermeneutical methods such as, for example, analogical rea- soning (qiyas) as practiced by legists of other legal schools. Consequently, scholars belonging to these madhhabs felt threatened by the concepts of Zahirism because the Zahiri notion of law undermined their authority as legal scholars and adherents of a particular legal tradition.1l Western historians have largely neglected the development of Zahirism as a topic of research. Since Goldziher's Die Zdhiriten was published, apart from the relevant entries in the Encyclopaedia of Islam and the studies by Roger Arnaldez, Ahmad M. Turki, and Anwar G. Chejne on selected aspects of Ibn Hazm's (d. 1053) legal works,'1 little has been done to provide a survey of the history of the Zahiri madhhab or of Zahiri thought in non-legal spheres in and after the 11th century. Indeed, there are impediments to the writing of a history of these two phenomena, especially for the time after Ibn Hazm. The most important of these impediments is the lack of sources written by Zahiri authors. For the reconstruction of the tenets of legal Zahirism and their development after the 11th century, we are therefore compelled to draw on information that is provided in works by non-Zahiri authors such as Tabaqat al- Shdfi'iyya by Taj al-Din al-Subki (d. 1370)12 and al-Mizan al-kubra by al-Shacrani (d. 1565). 3 Reading these sources, we must take into account the biases some of them held when presenting information concerning the madhhabs in general and the Zahiris in particular. While, for example, al-Shacrani's Mlzan is generally reputed to be a work that aims at the reconciliation, or at least the impartial presentation, of differing views as held by the various madhhabs, in Tabaqdt the Shafi'i al-Subki does not try to hide his hostility toward the Zahirism of Ibn Hazm.14 Confusion may sometimes arise from the fact that historiographical and biograph- ical sources mention individuals with the nisba "al-Zahiri" not only on the basis of affiliation to the Zahiri school of law.15 The father of the historian Abu'l-Mahasin ibn Taghribirdi16 was labeled "al-Zahiri" because he had belonged to the household of the first Mamluk sultan of the Circassian "dynasty," al-Zahir Barquq (r. 1382-89, 1390-99).17 Among the "Zahiris" of the 12th to 15th centuries listed by Goldziher are the mystic Ibn 'Arabi (d. 1240)18 and the prominent poet and grammarian Athir al-Din Abu Hayyan (d. 1344),19 because elements of Zahiri thought were identified in their works by some of their contemporaries. However, not every scholar who propagated ideas that resembled Zahiri tenets was described in the sources as a Zahiri. Goldziher pointed to some striking similarities between the theological and legal concepts of the Hanbali Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328)20 and Zahiri thought and men- tioned al-Maqrizi's (d. 1442) sympathy for Zahiri ideas in general and for Ibn Hazm's writings in particular.2' However, neither Ibn Taymiyya nor al-Maqrizi was denoted a "Zahiri" in our sources. In view of the lack of consistency in the use of the term "Zahiri" in historiograph- ical and biographical works, contradictions in the presentation of social, legal, and theological aspects of Zahirism in 13th- and 14th-century Egypt and Syria are to be</page><page sequence="4">206 Lutz Wiederhold expected. On the one hand, in the works of prominent authors belonging to various madhhabs, elements of Zahiri thought can be traced.22 This could account for the fact that the Maliki Ibn Farhun (d. 1397)23 counted the Zahiriyya among the madh- habs that were still extant in his day.24 To a certain degree, anti-Zahiri polemics can also be interpreted as an indicator of the scholarly and political relevance that was attributed to Zahirism in the period concerned. Some authors, such as the Maliki Ibrahim ibn Hasan ibn 'Abd al-Rafi' al-Rubaci al-Tunisi (d. 1333), who temporarily functioned as chief judge (qadd 'l-quddt) of his madhhab, devoted particular treatises to the refutation of Zahiri tenets.25 Fatwas also occasionally addressed the question of whether Zahirism was in conformity with "orthodoxy" as represented by the four established Sunni madhhabs. In one such fatwa, the Shafi'i Ibn al-Salah (d. 1243)26 examined the question of an anonymous petitioner as to whether the views of Dawud ibn 'Ali al-Zahiri should be considered part of the scholarly consensus (ijmd') of Dawud's time. In his response, Ibn al-Salah expounded the differing views among the Shafi'is concerning the acceptability of Zahiri ideas. For example, he pointed to the fact that some Shafi'i jurists held that the opinions of Dawud al-Zahiri concern- ing the principles of jurisprudence (usil al-flqh) which contradict the views of other schools might be regarded as relevant for the formulation of an ijmd', whereas his views on positive legal norms (furti') should be kept outside the realm of ijmad.27 At the same time, prominent authors of the period under examination did not con- sider Zahirism to be an acceptable and still-existing madhhab. For example, the great historian Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406)28 stated in his Muqaddima that, by his time, Zahir- ism as a legal school had died out and that only "worthless persons" would study Zahiri books.29 Altogether, the sources available do not clearly indicate whether Zahirism-500 years after its introduction as a doctrine into the legal-theological discourse of Islam-was still a significant factor of intellectual and social life. Different kinds of sources, including legal, historiographical, and biographical works, contain only scattered information suggesting that the Sunni elite rejected Zahirism in general. At the same time, individual representatives of the Sunni madhhabs occasionally re- ferred to Zahiri tenets in legal argumentation without expressing any disapproval of the views cited. The number of ulema who are described as Zahiris in the biograph- ical dictionaries of the 14th century is small. This could be due to the fact that some scholars who may have had sympathy for Zahiri ideas concealed their thoughts, since an affiliation to the Zahiri school could hardly be considered an advantage in pursu- ing a scholarly career.30 Nevertheless, in spite of traces of widespread disapproval of Zahiri concepts among the ulema of the established Sunni madhhabs, our informa- tion seems to confirm Goldziher's view that the history of Zahirism had not come to an end after its last prestigious representative, Ibn Hazm, had passed away. THE FITNA ZAHIRIYYA: GOLDZIHER'S DESCRIPTION IN DIE ZAHIRITEN As one way of illustrating the persistence of Zahiri ideas in the 14th century, Gold- ziher adduced the example of the "revolt of the Zahiris" in Damascus in 1386.31 In that year, as Goldziher reports, drawing on the chronicle al-I'lam bi-tdrlkh al-islam</page><page sequence="5">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 207 by Ibn Qadi Shuhba (d. 1448),32 a certain Khalid, a Hanbali who was originally from Hims, had come from Aleppo to the Syrian capital. There he found shelter in the house of a certain Ahmad al-Zahiri. Khalid al-Himsi, Goldziher states, was the in- stigator of the fitna. According to Goldziher, the Zahiri movement had gained mo- mentum first in Egypt. The fact that the Egyptian ustaddr Sharaf al-Din Musa Amir al-Zanki (d. 1386) was a fervent supporter of Zahiri ideas is mentioned by Goldziher in order to prove this.33 In a passage preceding the account on the fitna Zahiriyya,34 Goldziher gives a translation of the biography of Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ibn Isma'il ibn 'Abd al-Rahim Shihab al-Din Abu Hashim, known as al-Burhan (d. 1405), from Ibn Taghribirdi's (d. 1469) al-Manhal al-safl.35 In this passage, it is related that al- Burhan had been involved in a conspiracy against Sultan al-Zahir Barquq. He had studied with a certain Sacid al-Mashuli, who introduced him to Zahiri ideas. After- ward he had embarked on a journey to remote lands calling on the people there to practice Islam in strict accordance with the Qur'an and the sunna of the Prophet. Many followed his call. Finally, he and some of his followers were arrested in Hims and brought before the sultan, who reproached al-Burhan in a rough manner.36 As mentioned earlier, Goldziher deserves the credit for having brought informa- tion concerning the fitna and its background to our attention for the first time. How- ever, despite a striking accumulation of biographical and historiographical material on Zahirism in the 1380s, he did not make any explicit suggestions concerning a possible relationship between the isolated passages that he presented in Die 2Zdhir- iten. For example, though establishing a link between al-Burhan and the instigators of thefitna Zahiriyya, he apparently failed to realize that al-Burhan, mentioned by Ibn Taghribirdi, and Ahmad al-Zahiri, who, according to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, sheltered Khalid al-Himsi in Damascus, were one and the same person. This, however, is explicitly stated in Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani's biographical dictionary al-Durar al- kamina.37 As will be shown later, Goldziher was also misled by his source al-Manhal al-sdfi in stating that Ahmad was arrested in Hims. Also, it can be assumed that a more thorough reading of Ibn Qadi Shuhba's chronicle would have given Goldziher a more precise idea of the socio-political and ideological context of thefitna. In an introductory remark to the biographical note on Ahmad al-Burhan, Goldziher de- scribes him as an adherent of a movement aiming at the revival of the extinct Zahiri school.38 As the reader will see, this assessment does not reflect the motives of the revolt and its protagonists in a sufficient manner.39 More than 100 years after Goldziher's book on Zahirism was published, we now have more sources at our disposal-some of them in an edited version-than the two works from which he derived his information on thefitna Zahiriyya and the individ- uals involved. This enables us to attempt a new interpretation of thefitna. It has been demonstrated elsewhere that Mamluk historians tended to copy information from their predecessors.40 This sometimes could be taken to suggest that these sources provide identical information on particular historical events. However, in the case of thefitna Zahiriyya, it is worthwhile to look into a greater number of them, because in some cases the sources contradict or complement one another and thus open new perspectives on the events concerned.41 Even so, after a thorough reading of the rel- evant literature, it can be safely stated that the chronicle of Ibn Qadi Shuhba remains the most informative of the extant sources. In any case, it contains more particulars</page><page sequence="6">208 Lutz Wiederhold of the fitna and related issues than those presented by Goldziher. This could be due to the fact that the manuscript version of the chronicle prevented Goldziher from detecting all the passages that are of relevance for the reconstruction of thefitna. Be that as it may, the singular importance of Ibn Qadi Shuhba's chronicle as a source for the fitna Zahiriyya is to be expected, considering the fact that Ibn Qadi Shuhba's immediate authority, Ibn Hijji (d. 1413),42 lived in Damascus during the events in question and knew some of their protagonists personally. In the following, relevant information concerning the fitna Zahiriyya is collected from various historiographical and prosopographical sources in order to provide as complete and coherent a picture of this historical event as possible. With reference to the main objectives of the present study, the material presented will shed some more light on the fitna as an event with religious as well as political implications- which is important for our understanding of the relationship between ulema and Mamluks-and on the significance of the term "Zahiri" in this context. THE FITNA ZAHIRIYYA: A SULTANIC DECREE OF 1382 AS A PRELUDE TO THE EVENTS OF 1386 Our inquiry starts with an episode that can be viewed as a prelude to the events in Damascus in 1386. In December 1382, the Hanafi judge Sadr al-Din Ibn al-'Izz (d. 1 390)43 became the subject of an investigation because he had attached "unortho- dox" remarks concerning matters of the (religious) sciences44 to a versified eulogy on the Prophet Muhammad composed by the poet 'Ali ibn Aybak.45 This qasida, now devalued by the provocative remarks of Ibn al-'Izz, fell back into the hands of its author. The latter was quick to denounce Ibn al-'Izz to some (unspecified) jurists (fuqahd'), who, for their part, fervently rejected the opinions of Ibn al-'Izz and thus turned the matter into a public affair.46 Finally, the sultan, al-Zahir Barquq, became involved. In a decree, published on 27 December 1382, he reproached Ibn al-'Izz for having insulted the Prophet Mu- hammad and cast doubt on the practice of seeking his intercession. Interestingly, the Hanafifuqaha' of Cairo are mentioned in the decree as rejecting the views expressed by their fellow Hanafi Ibn al-'Izz. Ibn al-'Izz, the document continued, should be subjected to the penalty demanded by the shari'a for offenses such as his. In the same decree, without any reference to the case of Ibn al-'Izz, a group of Damascene schol- ars was accused of clinging to Zahiri ideas as represented by Ibn Hazm and Dawud al-Zahiri. These scholars supposedly propagated Zahiri ideas and publicized Zahiri works. The decree demanded that the accusations be further investigated, and, if proved true, that the Zahiris be subjected to the penalty that they deserved according to the shari'a.47 From the reproduction of Barquq's decree, we learn the names of four Damascene scholars who were described as Zahiris. They are al-Qurashi, Ibn al-Jabi, Ibn al-Husbani, and al-Yasufi. Three of these four scholars were to play a prominent part in the fitna Zahiriyya four years later. Not only does the decree concerning Ibn al-'Izz serve as important proof of the interference of Mamluk officials in religious matters; it also tells us that three pro- tagonists of the fitna Zahiriyya were denoted as Zahiris some time before 1386, and that the Mamluk ruler considered the adherence to Zahiri tenets as a reprehensible</page><page sequence="7">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 209 act. With regard to the evaluation of thefitna Zahiriyya, the decree vaguely suggests a link between political and religious matters. At the same time, however, it raises a number of interesting questions. What caused Sultan al-Zahir Barquq to reproach the Damascene Zahiris? Did he issue the decree in order to support scholars of the established madhhabs in the persecution of Zahiri tendencies among the learned? Did certain ulema play a part in the composition of the decree, and, if so, which ulema were particularly interested in the persecution of the Zahiri scholars and why?48 Did any link exist between the Zahiri question and political matters that might account for the direct intervention of the sultan? The paraphrasing of the decree as given earlier may have shown that it is impossible to derive a satisfactory answer to any of these questions from the document itself. Unfortunately, our sources provide no additional information concerning the decree's contents and religious-political con- sequences. However, looking at the individuals who are addressed as Zahiris in the document, it can reasonably be assumed that a relationship exists between the decree of 1382 and thefitna Zahiriyya of 1386. Therefore, we hope that an examination of the latter will help us to answer some of the questions raised by Barquq's decree. THE FITNA ZAHIRIYYA: A CHRONOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE EVENTS OF 1386 The sources that constitute the basis of this study describe thefitna Zahiriyya with different degrees of detail. Some chronicles do not mention the event at all;49 others confine their description of thefitna to some remarks about the individuals who were involved. However, a reading of the chronicles and the prosopographical literature on the period concerned provides material that is useful in the reconstruction of the fitna and its religious, doctrinal, and socio-political background. As mentioned earlier, Goldziher, drawing on Ibn Qadi Shuhba, described thefitna as having started after the arrival of Khalid al-Himsi from Aleppo in Damascus in 1386. The reader will also recall that Ahmad al-Zahiri (al-Burhan), the Damascene scholar who sheltered Khalid, was another central figure in the fitna who was men- tioned by Goldziher. Additional information concerning these two persons would no doubt be very useful for a reconstruction of the fitna's context. As to Khalid al- Himsi's biography, the sources at our disposal are far from exhaustive. We do not learn anything about his scholarly or social background apart from the fact that he belonged to the Hanbali madhhab. But in the passage of Ibn Qadi Shuhba's chronicle that immediately follows the one quoted by Goldziher, we learn more about Ahmad (al-Burhan) al-Zahiri in particular and the motive of the fitna in general.50 Ahmad had come to Damascus some years before 1386 and lived there as a Sufi and ascetic (mutaqashshif). He engaged in the study of the legal ideas of Ibn Hazm51 and associated with Sadr al-Din al-Yasufi-a scholar mentioned as a Zahiri in the decree of 1382-who admired him greatly and spoke highly of him. Two other Za- hiris mentioned in the decree, Ibn al-Jabi and Ibn al-Husbani, also venerated Ahmad and shared his views. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, their closeness to Ahmad was the reason for these three scholars being mentioned in Barquq's decree of 1382 as Zahiris.52 Moreover, we learn that in this decree, al-Qurashi had been added to the Zahiri group only because he was frequently seen sitting with the persons mentioned.</page><page sequence="8">210 Lutz Wiederhold But, in fact, al-Qurashi had an aversion to Ahmad al-Zahiri and described him as ignorant. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, in August 1386 al-Ghazzawi, a bedouin chief (min shuyikh al-'ashir), was held prisoner in the citadel of Damascus for an unspecified reason. One day, Khalid al-Himsi went to the citadel to see al-Ghazzawi. When they met, Khalid told al-Ghazzawi that a number of people had secretly pledged alle- giance to a new caliph who was worthy of the office and whom they themselves had appointed. He asked al-Ghazzawi to support their plan. Al-Ghazzawi suggested to Khalid that he should meet the governor of the citadel of Damascus (nd'ib al-qal'a), Ibn al-Himsi (d. 1389), because he probably would consent to their plans.53 Khalid met the nd'ib al-qal'a and, in the course of their conversation, mentioned some Damascenes and bedouins who supported the conspiracy. In Khalid's view, the reign of the current sultan was not sound (sahih), above all because he had imprisoned the caliph. In this statement, Khalid referred to events of the year 1383. The caliph who was imprisoned by Barquq was al-Mutawakkil 'ala 'l-lah Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr ibn Sulayman, who had been installed for the first time after his father's death in February 1362.54 Yet Khalid claimed that al-Mutawakkil had delegated his authority ('ahida) to the person to whom they now pledged allegiance. The candidate for the caliphate would be known by the laqab al-Mu'tasim and the kunya Abu Hashim al- Muttalibi. The nd'ib al-qal'a gave the impression that he would support the con- spiracy. He inquired about the new caliph, and Khalid told him of Ahmad al-Misri (that is, Ahmad al-Burhan al-Zahiri), who was the candidate for the caliphate, and his current residence. The governor ordered Ahmad to come to the citadel. When Ahmad entered the citadel, Khalid rose to his feet and welcomed him as the new caliph. According to one report, Ahmad disavowed Khalid's claim as soon as it dawned on him what was going on. According to another report, he maintained that only he and Khalid had agreed on this attempt to install a new caliph. Be that as it may, both Khalid and Ahmad were imprisoned. The nd'ib al-qal'a, Ibn al-Himsi, and the chamberlain and governor in the absence of the official governor (al-hajib, na'ib al-ghayba), Ibn Qibjaq (d. 1390),5 wrote a letter that, in all probability, they sent to Cairo to inform the sultan about the conspiracy. At that time, the governor of Da- mascus and Syria, Baydamur (d. 1387),56 was absent, as he was when the reply arrived. It was therefore the chamberlain who received the order to compel the prisoners to name their co-conspirators. At this point, an element is added to the account that shows that the fitna Zahiriyya was not merely a rebellion of a limited number of religious scholars against a Mam- luk ruler aimed at the restoration of the caliphate. Apparently, Ibn al-Himsi and Ibn Qibjaq had provided Cairo with their personal interpretations of the events.57 Bay- damur also had informed the sultan about the conspiracy in a letter. However, the re- port composed by Ibn Qibjaq and Ibn al-Himsi had arrived before the governor's and, it seems, was of greater persuasive power. Because the governor, Baydamur, figured as a supporter of the conspiracy in their version,58 he, his son Muhammad Shah (d. 139 1),59 his nephew, 'Ala' al-Din al-Khazindar, and the emirs Jabra'il (d. 139 1)60 and Asanbugha were imprisoned one month after the detention of Ahmad and Kha- lid-that is, in September 1386.61 It seems that the two, Ibn Qibjaq and Ibn al-Himsi,</page><page sequence="9">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 211 understood the events of thefitna as the perfect opportunity to rid themselves of their immediate rival in the Mamluk hierarchy.62 After Baydamur and his entourage were eliminated, the chamberlain went to the madrasa al-Aminiyya to get hold of Sadr al- Din al-Yasufi and ordered Ibn al-Husbani to be brought to the citadel as well. Ac- cording to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Ahmad had confessed that the two scholars had issued a fatwa on the duty to instigate a conspiracy against Barquq. Al-Yasufi was put in prison, but Ibn al-Husbani managed to escape in time. Another religious scholar who, in Ahmad's confession, had been mentioned as having issued afatwa in favor of the conspiracy and who was therefore brought to the citadel, was Amin al-Din Ibn al- Najib al-Hanbali (d. 1391), the qadi from Baalbek.63 In the following days and weeks, more members of Baydamur's entourage were imprisoned. Often, the involvement of an emir in activities hostile to the current sul- tan also entailed financial and economic consequences for the accused. In October, the sultan's mushidd (or shadd) al-dawa-win, Mahmud (d. 1397), arrived from Cairo to demand the payment of an unspecified sum to the treasury from Baydamur and his friends and relatives.64 In the course of events, it became clear that the primary ob- jective of this measure was to deprive Baydamur of all material means and to fill the sultan's pocket at the same time. In this, the shadd al-dawdwin, Mahmud, proved to be a willing tool of the sultan. He went as far as to deduct from the people the wheat that was due to the governor, Baydamur, in order to be able to confiscate the profit, a practice described by the chronicler as a serious injustice.65 Also, Baydamur's horses were estimated at their lowest price and passed into the sultan's possession. In November, a document from Cairo arrived in which Ahmad was ordered to be brought to the Egyptian capital. Accordingly, Ahmad, and with him Khalid and some other individuals involved in the fitna, were sent to Cairo. Al-Yasufi, Ibn al-Najib, and others, however, remained in Damascus. In the meantime, another scholar who had taken part in the fitna and who had gone into hiding for some days, Shihab al-Din al-Malkawi, surfaced. He was beaten and imprisoned like his companions.66 After some days, those rebels who had been imprisoned in Damascus asked in a letter to be released or killed. However, they were severely beaten and then forced to work in chains on the sultan's building sites. But there they could be seen in public, and some accounts report that, after some days, the common people (camma) of Damas- cus took pity on the detainees. According to these accounts, members of the Cdmma even gathered around them and started to express "inappropriate views," probably against the Mamluk authorities.67 The military officials reacted immediately and took the detainees from the building sites back to prison. It is noteworthy that this passage is the only one suggesting a sympathy among the populace for thefitna. At the same time, it demonstrates that the oppositional activity of a relatively small circle of prom- inent figures was regarded as having the potential to develop into a larger insurrec- tion. The government was aware of this danger and tried hard not to give the lower classes any occasion to take action. Another demonstration of solidarity with the rebels was averted when an ordinance from the sultan arrived in Damascus in which the imprisonment of Shaykh Yusuf al- Zu'ayfarini was demanded.68 Al-Zu'ayfarini had been riding around the citadel of Damascus praying for the former governor, Baydamur, and announcing that he would</page><page sequence="10">212 Lutz Wiederhold soon free him. Al-Zu'ayfarini, however, got wind of the plan to seize him and escaped in time.69 As to the scholars who were transferred from Damascus to Cairo, al-Maqrizi de- votes a passage of his chronicle al-Sultik to their arrival in the Egyptian capital.70 On 24 December, al-Maqrizi reports, four fuqaha' arrived from Damascus. They were accused of seeking the abolition of the sultanate and propagating the installation of a caliph of Qurashi origin as political ruler of the Muslim community.7' On 16 January 1387, the detainees were brought before the sultan. During the interrogation, Ahmad Ibn al-Burhan replied to the sultan's questions. He criticized him and told him that the rebels had acted on behalf of the (true) Muslims. He also mentioned some points that were held against the sultan by the rebels-such as the practice of taking taxes not justified by the shari'a (mukts)-and claimed that only a Qurashi caliph would represent the Muslims properly. Sultan al-Zahir apparently was not impressed by Ahmad's philippic. His main concern was to squeeze out of the detainees the identity of the emirs who had supported the conspiracy. Therefore, he ordered that the pris- oners be tortured until they revealed which officers had cooperated with the Zahiris.72 Thereafter, the sources consulted do not inform the reader about the Zahiris' fate for a long time. From Baydamur's necrologue in Ibn Qadi Shuhba's chronicle, we learn that the accusations brought against him turned out to be false. Nevertheless, he died a broken man in the citadel of Damascus in February 1387.73 Further, in a very short note it is stated that, in March 1389, Amin al-Din Ibn al-Najib and other Zahiris who had been imprisoned in the citadel of Damascus were set free, after Ahmad al-Zahiri, Khalid, and their companions who had been transferred to Cairo had been set at large some days before on the order of the Emir Jarkas al-Khalili (d. 1389)74 and the intercession of the influential Shafi'i Siraj al-Din al-Bulqini. Al- together, the Zahiris had spent two years and seven months in prison, and at least one of them-Sadr al-Din al-Yasufi-did not survive the period of detention.75 The examination of the fitna suggests a close link between religious and political motives as well as between activities of certain ulema and the Mamluks. The con- spirators' plan to overthrow the regime of al-Zahir Barquq was clearly based on the religious-political concept of the caliphate. However, for Mamluk officials, the reli- gious background of thefitna seems to have been of marginal importance. The case of Baydamur demonstrates that they understood it as an opportunity to settle ac- counts among themselves. The hajib Ibn Qibjaq and the nd'ib al-qal'a Ibn al-Himsi seized this opportunity to oust the governor of Damascus, Baydamur. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Ibn Qibjaq in particular did everything he could to humiliate Baydamur and supported everyone who wanted to harm the former governor.76 The sources do not indicate interest on the part of the sultan or any Mamluk official in religious-political aspects of the insurgence. THE FITNA ZAHIRIYYA: TWO RELIGIOUS-POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE REVOLT CALIPHATE AND NON-SHARIcA TAXES Two of the objectives of the Zahiri conspirators-though largely ignored by Mam- luk officials-can be regarded as critical elements of the broader religious-political background of the time under examination:</page><page sequence="11">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 213 First, the most important motive of the fitna was to enhance the political signifi- cance of the caliphate. This may elicit some surprise, because the end of the caliph- ate of Baghdad in 1258 is sometimes viewed as a turning point in the history of this institution, after which the caliphate was reduced in political significance to become a mere tool of religious legitimation for the representatives of temporal power.77 But it hardly needs to be discussed here in detail that this notion has been relativized by studies suggesting that the political authority of the caliph had been limited con- siderably long before the 13th century, and that certain notions of the caliphate re- tained political importance independently of its legitimizing function until the present century.78 The description of thefitna in Ibn Qadi Shuhba's chronicle provides the impres- sion that the installation of a politically independent caliph was the main objective of the rebels. Under the "Bahri," or Qipjaq, Mamluks, the caliph had hardly ever gained any influence on political affairs. The holders of the position usually appeared in public when a new sultan ascended to power. Then the caliph had to play his part in the ceremony of investiture. The caliphs' views on matters of political relevance were mostly ignored. This was, for example, the case when the Caliph Mustakfi bi- 'l-lah Abu 'l-Rabi' Sulayman (d. 1339) transferred the caliphate to his son Ahmad in his last will. As this did not suit the plans of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun (d. 1341), the cousin of Ahmad, Ibrahim, was installed as caliph. Only after al-Nasir had passed away was the will executed, and then only after the intervention of the four chief judges of Cairo.79 However, the arrogance with which the Mamluk ruler often treated the caliph did not, to our knowledge, prompt any public protest voiced by the religious elite under the "Bahri" Mamluks.80 Al-Zahir Barquq, the first in the line of Circassian rulers, generally appears to have been aware of the importance of the official consent of the caliph for the legitimacy of his power. In official ceremonies, he used the presence of the caliph to emphasize his role as the legitimate protector of the Muslim community. This was the case, for example, when Barquq entered Damascus in August 1390 after his opponent Emir Mintash had been forced to withdraw. In the procession to the citadel, the caliph rode in front of Barquq, symbolizing the legitimacy of Barquq's claim to political supremacy.81 However, shortly after having seized the sultanate, Barquq seems to have provoked the hostility of religious scholars who held the notion of a politically important caliphate. In August 1383, an attempt to overthrow Barquq had been undertaken by the emirs Qurt and Ibrahim ibn Qutluqtamur (d. 1389)82 in the name of a full resto- ration of the caliphate.83 According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, the two officers who could count on the support of a group of about 800 Kurdish soldiers had called on the Caliph al-Mutawakkil 'ala 'l-lah (d. 1405)84 to join them in their plan to kill the sul- tan and his officers when they went to the playground to play polo. The conspiracy, however, was revealed to Barquq by Salah al-Din ibn Nasir al-Din ibn Tankiz, a grandson of the former governor of Damascus, Tankiz.85 Qurt, Ibrahim and the caliph were brought before the sultan and interrogated. After being threatened with severe punishment, Qurt confessed to having planned the conspiracy. But he also stated that the caliph had persuaded him to do so. The caliph, however, denied this, and since the interrogation came to no result Barquq lost his poise and wanted to beat the caliph.</page><page sequence="12">214 Lutz Wiederhold He even decided to have him nailed (tasmir) like the two rebellious emirs. But Sudun al-Shaykhuni and other officers prevented the sultan from punishing the caliph in such a severe and provocative manner, because they were afraid that the Camma would stone the sultan and his officers for doing so. Therefore, only the two emirs were nailed-Qurt being quartered afterward while Ibrahim was saved from capital pun- ishment and the caliph was imprisoned in the citadel. Soon thereafter, al-Mutawak- kil was discharged from office, and Rukn al-Din 'Umar ibn Ibrahim, the son of the Caliph al-Mu'tasim, was installed as the new caliph al-Wathiq bi-'l-lah (d. 1386).86 A fatwa was issued in which the dismissal of al-Mutawakkil was declared to be legit- imate, and the Hanafi judge Sadr al-Din Ibn Mansur supported this fatwa, probably in order to save al-Mutawakkil from more severe punishment.87 In their protest against the imprisonment of the caliph, as expressed by Khalid al- Himsi during his conversation with the governor of the Damascene citadel Ibn al- Himsi, the instigators of the fitna Zahiriyya referred directly to the events of the rebellion under Qurt. Apparently they did not recognize al-Wathiq bi-'l-lah, who was caliph when the fitna started, as a worthy substitute for al-Mutawakkil. In October 1386 that is, during thefitna-the sultan pledged allegiance to Muhyi al-Din Zaka- riyya ibn al-Mu'tasim bi-'l-lah as the new caliph, al-Mustadsim bi-'l-lah, after al- Wathiq bi-'l-lah, his brother, had died. Al-Mustadsim received a stipend (ritib) and, like his predecessors, had to entrust Sultan Barquq with political authority.88 How- ever, in January 1389, Sultan Barquq re-installed al-Mutawakkil 'ala 'l-lah as caliph and apologized to him after he had left him in prison on the citadel for almost six years. It may be of no little significance that Barquq repented what he had done to al-Mutawakkil shortly before he was displaced as sultan and Hajji ibn Sha'ban at- tained power, at least nominally, for a second time as Sultan al-Mansur.89 According to Ibn Hajar, Barquq had heard that Yalbugha al-Nasiri, his opponent who later be- came atabek under al-Mansur Hajji, would condemn him for having imprisoned the caliph and would use this fact as a pretext for taking action against Barquq.90 Bar- quq's wish for reconciliation with al-Mutawakkil could therefore be understood as an attempt to secure the support of the religious elite in the emerging conflict with Yalbugha. However, the sources do not explicitly point to such a motive. Be that as it may, three months later, in April 1389, the preachers of Cairo again prayed for the Caliph al-Mutawakkil.91 The fact that Ahmad, during his interrogation, demanded a caliph of Qurashi or- igin to take over the reign may be interpreted as indicating the rebels' adherence to the tenets of Muslim tradition, because in hadith the caliphate was a prerogative of the Quraysh.2 However, in view of the fact that the caliphs who had been installed by the Mamluk rulers before thefitna were also described as being of Qurashi origin, the reference to hadith is not a satisfactory explanation for Ahmad al-Burhan's in- sistence on a Qurashi caliph as the representative of the Muslim community. It therefore must be concluded that Ahmad, mentioning a Qurashi caliph, did not only have in mind the descendence from the Prophet as a necessary precondition for the caliphate but was, at the same time, calling for a restoration of the caliphate as the superior religious-political institution that it had been in the early days of Islam. It may be noted in passing that the vision of a caliph concentrating, at least in theory,</page><page sequence="13">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 215 governmental and religious authority in his hands became reality a few years after the fitna when the Caliph al-Mustadin was entrusted with the sultanate for a short period in 1412.93 With regard to the military basis of attempts at restoring the caliphate, it is worth noting that in thefitna Zahiriyya, as well as in Qurt's rebellion, the bedouins seem to have played a critical role. Looking for support for his coup d'etat, Qurt had es- tablished contact with bedouin tribes.94 In addition, Khalid al-Himsi, in his conver- sation with the nd'ib al-qal'a Ibn al-Himsi, had mentioned bedouins, who would be ready to join the rebels against Barquq.95 Taken together, the sources suggest that the caliph, despite his marginal influence on the political affairs of the day, was still a prominent religious-political figure among the scholarly elite and the populace of the two urban centers of the Mamluk empire Cairo and Damascus and that faithfulness to the caliphate in their circles was re- garded as a sign of outstanding piety.96 Second, apart from the question of the caliphate, the levy of taxes that were not justified by the shari'a (maks/mukas) was a subject that provided arguments against Mamluk officials. The reader will remember that Ahmad al-Burhan al-Zahiri had complained about the levy of such extra canonical taxes when interrogated by the sultan. A case of open opposition to these taxes during the period under examination- in the year 1386 is mentioned in al-Maqrizi's chronicle al-Suliik. There the author reports the punishment inflicted on a Shafi'i scholar from Damanhur, Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn al-Jundi al-Shafi'i, who had dared to refuse the paying of muktis to the sultan's tax collectors. Ibn al-Jundi was beaten and deprived of the right to live in Damanhur. However, it is reported that when the sultan learned about Ibn al-Jundi's scholarly abilities and his piety, he asked his pardon, bestowed upon him a robe of honor, and permitted him to return to Damanhur as a mark of respect.97 Also, in the context of thefitna Zahiriyya, the question of mukuts is of some importance, because the popularity of the Syrian Governor Baydamur among the populace of Damascus was partly based on the fact that he had abolished these taxes during his term of rule. This may explain why at least one case is reported in which a member of the in- digenous religious community, Shaykh Yusuf al-Zu'ayfarini, protested against the detention of Baydamur. The raising of the problem of mukiis by the instigators of thefitna, like the ques- tion of a caliph of Qurashi origin, may reflect their faithfulness to the Prophetic tra- dition, because there is a well-known hadith that describes hell fire as the ultimate destiny of those who levy mukas.98 Again, in view of the political and economic rel- evance of mukiis in Mamluk times, it seems inappropriate to reduce the motive of the fitna regarding mukiis to merely establishing a rule formulated in hadith as a template for socio-economic practice. Mukiis were often the subject of dispute for purely po- litical reasons, without any link to doctrinal matters. For example, it has been shown elsewhere that at the beginning of the 14th century, mukiis could be given by the sul- tan as fiefs to Mamluk officers. In 1317, Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad issued a decree in which he ordered the abolition of mukiis levied by amirs in the region around Trip- oli. However, the sultan's primary concern was not to comply with economic rules as formulated in the Qur'an and the sunna. His most important aim was to diminish</page><page sequence="14">216 Lutz Wiederhold the financial capacities of the amirs whom he considered to be a threat to his own political authority. At the same time, he hoped to win the support of the people who had suffered from the numerous extra canonical taxes they had been forced to pay.99 To sum up, the information collected in the previous paragraphs was particularly interesting with regard to two of the main objectives of our study: the account of the fitna demonstrated that the spheres of the learned elite and representatives of tempo- ral power could intersect in matters of daily politics. While investigating the mo- tives of the fitna, we further learned that the term "Zahiri" not only had doctrinal connotations, but that it could also stand for certain religious-political and social aims. In the following chapter, we will turn to a discussion of the biographical details of al-Qurashi, Ibn al-Jabi, Ibn al-Husbani, and al-Yasufi the four ulema who had been denoted as Zahiris in the decree issued by Sultan Barquq in 1382. From an ex- amination of their biographies, we will gain more information concerning the third main issue of this study that is, the internal relationships between members of the learned elite. As three of the four Zahiri scholars mentioned in the decree played an important part in the fitna Zahiriyya, an analysis of their biographies can also be expected to add to our picture of this event and to provide an explanation for the fitna that goes beyond the mere discussion of Zahiri ideas. THE FOUR DAMASCENE ZAHIRIS" NAMED IN THE DECREE OF 1382 Al-Qurashi Zayn al-Din 'Umar ibn Muslim ibn Sacid al-Malahi al-Qubaybati al-Dimashqi, known as al-Qurashi (d. 1390),100 was a Shafi'i scholar of high reputation among his con- temporaries. He issued fatwas;'0' his scholarly authority allowed him to grant per- mission to junior scholars to do so, as well.'02 Born in 1324, he came to Damascus in his forties and settled in Qubaybat. There he engaged in the recitation of the Qur'an and in the religious sciences ('ilm). He studied fiqh, usil al-fiqh, and hadith, and was introduced to the scholarly circles of Damascus by Taj al-Din al-Subki (d. 1370), one of the eminent Shafi'i scholars of his time. At some point, he occu- pied himself with preaching (mawd'iz) and gained some popularity in Damascus. He also filled a number of teaching positions at Damascene madrasas and functioned as a teaching assistant (ifrda).'03 The biography of Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi contains a number of episodes that sug- gest a continuous competition for paid positions among the learned in Mamluk times. For example, in July 1385, al-Qurashi was forced to quit his position as teacher at the madrasa al-Nasiriyyal04 when it was claimed that he was holding it illegitimately. The founder of the waqf (waqif) of this school, it was said, had stipulated that only the chief judge should function as a teacher at the school. Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi, who did not meet this condition, had taken over the position from the qadi Fath al-Din Ibn al-Shahid (d. 1391),105 and claimed that the former'06 and current chief judges had confirmed his right to hold the office. But when asked about the matter, the current chief judge, Burhan al-Din Ibn Jama'a, stated that he had not expressly confirmed al-Qurashi's right to hold the office and that he had not been aware of the</page><page sequence="15">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 217 wdqif s stipulation in the first place. The Maliki judge who was asked to examine the matter decided that al-Qurashi could not be forced to pay back the salary-7,000 dirhams-which he had received during his tenure. This Maliki judge, however, was reprimanded for his decision by the Shafi'i chief judge, Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca. In a letter, Burhan al-Din demanded that his Maliki colleague provide evidence that his decision was in conformity with the doctrine of his madhhab. The Maliki was asked to identify his source and the scholar on whom he had been relying for his decision. Further, Burhan al-Din reminded the Maliki judge of the fact that he was not permitted to decide the matter according to his own view, because he lacked the qualification of a mujtahid. The Maliki judge justified his decision, stating that he had decided the matter according to his own view, but while following the principle of equity (maslaha) of the two parties involved. In response, Burhan al-Din sent an envoy with the waqf document to the Maliki judge to let him know that the stipula- tion laid down in this document rendered the decision of a qadi superfluous. Even- tually, the Maliki judge expressly revoked his decision, a matter that rekindled the conflict with the chief judge, because several Maliki fuqaha' had opined in fatwas that the revoking of a decision by the qadi who had issued it was a sinful act. Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi lost the position. He went into hiding and thus apparently could avoid paying back the amount that he had earned as a mudarris.107 It is noteworthy that at the time of this legal dispute, al-Qurashi found himself at variance with the outstanding Shafi'i faqih and chief judge, Burhan al-Din Ibn Jama'a, because of a fatwa that had been issued by al-Qurashi and another scholar who was accused of Zahiri inclinations-namely, Ibn al-Husbani. The subject of this conflict with Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca that is described by Ibn Qadi Shuhba as hav- ing resulted in a trial (mihna) will be discussed in greater detail later.108 In this con- text, it may be of some interest that in 1379 Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca had released both Zayn al-Din and his son, Shihab al-Din al-Qurashi (d. 1391),109 from another trial in which father and son were accused of attempting to spread anthropomorphism (tashbih/tajsim) among the people of the lower classes of Cairo."10 There had ap- parently been no serious differences between Ibn Jamaca and al-Qurashi before. It is possible that they even were on friendly terms, which would account for the fact that Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca stood by the Qurashis in a difficult situation. But the sources are silent on this issue, and it seems equally possible that Ibn Jamaca had just defended the two Qurashis as fellow Shafi'is against the accusations brought forward by the Hanafi muhtasib Jamal al-Din Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-'Ajami (d. 1397)111 who had led the investigation against them in this case. In 1389, when Zayn al-Din's son, Shihab al-Din al-Qurashi, became chief judge of Damascus, replacing Burhan al-Din Ibn Jama'a, he installed Zayn al-Din as a teacher at the Nasiriyya and Atabakiyya madrasas and as shaykh at the Dar al-hadith al-Ashrafiyya.112 Zayn al-Din also took over the position of khatib, the preacher of the Friday sermon, in all probability at the Umayyad mosque. Shihab al-Din had owed his nomination to the Emir Yalbugha al-Nasiri,113 who had sent him from Cairo to Damascus to take over the position of qddi 'l-qudt during the rebellion in- stigated by Emir Yalbugha against Sultan Barquq in 1389. Shihab al-Din apparently remained in office for a short while under the rule of the second participant in the revolt against Barquq, Emir Mintash. In March 1390, Shihab al-Din was removed</page><page sequence="16">218 Lutz Wiederhold from his offices by Mintash during the latter's temporary rule and was subjected to a trial because Mintash suspected him of conspiracy against his authority (al- mubatana 'alayhi). In an anonymous letter, Mintash had been informed that Shihab al-Din had defended the cause of Barquq as the legitimate ruler.'14 However, after Sultan Barquq defeated Mintash, he punished scholars who had filled positions under his rivals. In the course of this action, Zayn al-Din and Shihab al-Din, despite hav- ing fallen into disgrace with Mintash, went through a series of trials (mihan), at the end of which they had to pay a substantial amount of money as a price for their dis- loyalty to Barquq. Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi, it is said, even had to pawn his library in order to raise the money. This must have been a severe sacrifice for a man who was known as a collector of rare and valuable books. He died in prison in 1390.115 Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi could appear to have been a well-trained scholar of the religious sciences with a curriculum vitae similar to that of many of his learned contemporaries if it were not for a remark by Ibn Qadi Shuhba to the effect that this Qurashi had on many occasions disapproved of the behavior of members of the re- ligious establishment.'16 Interestingly enough, this judgment on al-Qurashi's attitude toward the representatives of the commonly accepted doctrine (arbab al-sunna) is embedded in a series of phrases praising his high virtues and qualities as a teacher. He is described as courageous, helping the students of the religious sciences and defending the truth (Qaqq) against those without respect for it."17 Ibn Qadi Shuhba, himself not suspected of any sympathy for deviators from the commonly accepted doctrine, obviously saw no reason to doubt al-Qurashi's orthodoxy or to qualify him as a heretic. This is noteworthy, even if we take into account that Ibn Qadi Shuhba may have adopted the positive attitude in his account of al-Qurashi's life from Shihab al-Din Ibn Hijji,118 who was deputy judge during Shihab al-Din ibn Zayn al-Din al- Qurashi's tenure as chief judge in the Syrian capital in 1389,119 and who is likely to have written about the two Qurashis in a sympathetic manner. To sum up, Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi is described in the sources as an acknowledged scholar with a biography similar to that of many other ulema of his time. However, some details of his career are mentioned through which he can be distinguished from the average scholar: For reasons not specified in the sources, he criticized members of the religious establishment of his day. Also, he is described as someone who on several occasions propagated unorthodox-that is, anthropomorphic and Zahiri- ideas. Yet apart from this, there is no indication of a general disagreement between him and the scholarly elite on issues of legal or theological doctrine. He appears to have been an eloquent speaker who, as a preacher, impressed his audience.'20 From the fact that he assumed several positions during the short rule of Yalbugha al-Nasiri over Damascus in his late days, we can infer that Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi did not avoid contact with the representatives of temporal power in general. His biography suggests, however, that he refused to accept al-Zahir Barquq's claim to the sultanate. Ibn al-Jabi Najm al-Din Ahmad Ibn 'Uthman Ibn al-Jabi al-Yasufi (d. 1385),121 like al-Qurashi, is described in our sources as a highly regarded scholar. In the view of Ibn Qadi Shuhba, his own father, Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qadi Shuhba (d. 1388) and Ibn</page><page sequence="17">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 219 al-Jabi were the two most distinguished persons of their town.'22 He was born in 1336 into poor circumstances123 and in his early days became interested in hadith and fiqh. We know of several positions that Ibn al-Jabi occupied in the sphere of instruction in the religious sciences. He functioned as a repetitor at the madrasa Rukniyya124 in Damascus (i'ddat al-Rukniyya), an office that he handed to another individual de- scribed as a Zahiri, Sadr al-Din Sulayman ibn Yusuf al-Yasufi (d. 1387),125 when the latter came to Damascus.126 He also functioned as a mufti at the dar al-cadl.127 His father is said to have been a revenue officer of religious endowments ( jdbi '-awqlif) in Syria.128 Brought up, however, under poor conditions, Ibn al-Jabi and his son gained some money from an inheritance after the death of Ibn al-Jabi's wife. Ibn al-Jabi became successfully engaged in trade with Egypt, and through this activity he apparently made close contact with a functionary in the Mamluk bureaucracy of Cairo, the katib al-sirr Awhad al-Din.'29 Awhad al-Din probably paved the way for Ibn al-Jabi to a teaching position at the madrasa al-Zahiriyya al-Jawwaniyya and to the position of a repetitor at the madrasa al-Shamiyya al-Jawwaniyya.130 It is again Ibn Hijji, quoted by Ibn Qadi Shuhba, who adds to the scarce biographical informa- tion on Ibn al-Jabi some personal reflections on his abilities and character. Thanks to Ibn Hijji's remarks, we can picture Ibn al-Jabi as a person of extraordinarily high intelligence equipped with persuasive power in scholarly disputations. Although Ibn al-Jabi was reputed to attack his partners in a disputation, Ibn Hijji states that he personally enjoyed scholarly encounter with him.'31 Ibn al-Husbani The third person in Barquq's decree who was accused of Zahiri inclinations-Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn Isma'il ibn Khalifa, known as Ibn al-Husbani (d. 1412)-also was reputed to be a respectable religious scholar of his time.132 His father, cImad al-Din al-Husbani, an outstanding Shafififaqiih, taught him his first lessons in jurisprudence (fiqh) and the laws of descent and shares of inheritance (fard'id), and Shams al-Din al-Mizzi (d. 1383)133 introduced him to the science of hadith. Later, he filled teach- ing positions at the Shamiyya Jawwaniyya, the Aminiyya,134 and the Ashrafiyya135 in Damascus. The professorship (tadris) and supervision (nazar) of the Aminiyya were subject to continuous rivalry between Ibn al-Husbani and Badr al-Din al-Zura'i (d. 1383).136 In May 1382, after each of the two had been installed five times, the governor of Damascus and a commission of judges settled the controversy by split- ting the responsibilities into two separate positions, professor and supervisor (ndzir). Ibn al-Husbani was entrusted with the prestigious professorship but had to dispense with two of his minor positions-as supervisor of a bathhouse and as a repetitor (nazar hammam al-Shujd', iadat al-Shamiyya al-Jawwdniyya) to the advantage of al-Zura'i. But even after the governor's decision, the quarrels continued. The chief judge of Damascus called on the new supervisor, al-Zura9i, to provide Ibn al-Husbani with a share of the waqf's income only if this was in accordance with the law. The endowment document was produced in order to prove that it did not stipulate any pre- cise amount to pay a professor. Interestingly, Ibn al-Husbani went as far as to the town of Safad to ask the judge Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-'Uthmani</page><page sequence="18">220 Lutz Wiederhold for his opinion concerning the matter. Al-'Uthmani decided that Ibn al-Husbani should be paid the amount that the professor had usually been granted before.137 The sources suggest that Shihab al-Din Ibn al-Husbani was viewed with suspicion by some of the leading representatives of the religious legal establishment. In July 1385, he and Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi were reprimanded by the Shafici Chief Judge Burhan al-Din Ibn JamaCa for a fatwa that the two scholars had issued. The subject of the fatwa remains obscure in our source. However, a short notice in the description of events of the following year, 1386, indicates that the fatwa could have been of po- litical relevance. In February of this year, a man from Safad named Ibn al-Bajasi had contact with a group of people who had been exiled to this town because of their involvement in a plot to assassinate Sultan Barquq. Al-Bajasi held against them their failure to carry out their plan, and at the same time incited them to resume their ac- tivities. When the governor of Safad learned of Ibn al-Bajasi's agitation, he wrote to Sultan al-Zahir Barquq asking him how to deal with the troublemaker. The sultan ordered him to flog al-Bajasi and to cut out his tongue. The order was executed im- mediately, and al-Bajasi did not survive the procedure. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, many people of Safad rejoiced at al-Bajasi's fate because they had known him as an evil and impertinent person. By 1385, Ibn Qadi Shuhba continues, the Hanaff judge of Safad had charged him with unbelief (kufr), because he allegedly had refused to acknowledge that the ultimate authority is with God here and in the hereafter.138 After the qadi's verdict, the case had been taken to an assembly of legal scholars (majlis) in Damascus. On the occasion of this majlis, Ibn al-Husbani and Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi had been asked-it remains obscure by whom, but in all probability by the chief judge of Damascus, Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca for their opinion regarding the matter. Yet both Ibn al-Husbani and al-Qurashi issued a fatwa contrary to the Hanafi qadi's decision.1l3 One can only speculate whether the accusation brought against al-Bajasi had a political implication and was related to his opposition to al- Zahir Barquq. Be that as it may, it seems safe to assume that this fatwa concerning al-Bajasi was the one for which Ibn al-Husbani and Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi had been reproached by Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca. Ibn Qadi Shuhba describes the content of the fatwa as contrary to the view of this judge. By virtue of his office, Burhan al-Din stripped the two scholars of a number of their positions.140 One month after these events, Sultan al-Zahir Barquq issued a decree that dealt with the practice of issuing fatwas. In this decree, he reproached those who ignored the accepted doctrine in their fatwas. He ordered that only recognized scholars of sound knowledge and religion should have the right to issue legal opinions, and only after they had acquired permission from the chief judges of their madhhab. After the publication of this decree, the Shafi'i chief judge, Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca, nom- inated seven Shafi'i muftis-among them one faqih who had been mentioned among the Zahiris of Damascus, Sadr al-Din al-Yasufi-and his Hanafi colleague confined the right of issuing fatwas to only three scholars of his madhhab. But as the matter was not pursued too strictly, restrictions with regard to the rendering of fatwas soon may have lost their significance. However, Ibn al-Husbani and al-Qurashi did not profit from this negligence in the observation of the decree. The ban on both re- mained in effect, a fact confirmed by the action taken by Burhan al-Din Ibn Jamaca against the two in October 1385, when Ibn al-Husbani and al-Qurashi were summoned</page><page sequence="19">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 221 to appear before the governor after a request expressed by this chief judge. Ibn al- Husbani and al-Qurashi made an attempt to escape toward Egypt but were caught in Ramla and sent back to Damascus. After their arrival, they were brought to the cit- adel, and a fatwa was requested concerning the amount Ibn al-Husbani had received as a preacher of the Tawba mosque.'4' The request for the fatwa referred to the en- dowment deed which stipulated that the khatpb of this mosque must know the Qur'an by heart, a condition that Ibn al-Husbani failed to fulfil. Ibn al-Jazari, who had taken over the position after the dismissal of Ibn al-Husbani, reclaimed the amount of money that the latter had drawn out of the waqf 's income. This claim against Ibn al-Husbani was reinforced by another decree on behalf of Sultan Barquq in which the ruler confirmed that Ibn al-Husbani must refund the sum, amounting to 30,000 dirhams. During the events described, the ban on Ibn al-Husbani and al-Qurashi was renewed, as it was announced in Damascus that neither was permitted to issue fatwas. Ibn al- Husbani and al-Qurashi were imprisoned for twenty-five days after their arrival in Damascus. 142 As mentioned earlier, in August 1386 Ibn al-Husbani played a prominent part in the fitna Zahiriyya. In the aftermath of the events of the fitna, he managed to escape arrest and went into hiding, surfacing in Cairo, from where he is reported to have sent a letter to Damascus two years later, in November 1388. In the meantime, he had found shelter at the house of Siraj al-Din al-Bulqini (d. 1402)'43 and was pardoned by Sultan Barquq after al-Bulqini's intercession.'44 Back in Damascus in July 1389, he was installed as khatib of the mosque of the 'Uqaybal45 quarter, replacing his old rival Ibn al-Jazari. He also regained the posi- tion of mu'id at the madrasa al-Shamiyya al-Jawwaniyya.146 In February 1390, he became head of the hadith school al-Ashrafiyya.147 In May of the same year, Ibn al- Husbani was involved in legal action taken against Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn 'Umar al-Qurashi, who had been accused of secretly agitating against Emir Mintash, then the temporary ruler over Damascus during the rebellion against Sultan al-Zahir Bar- quq. 148 A document in which Ibn al-Qurashi had called on the readers to obey the le- gitimate sultan, al-Zahir Barquq, and in which he agitated against the rebel Mintash, had been passed to the latter's hands surreptitiously.'49 An assembly of localfuqaha7' was convoked to discuss his case. Interestingly, after Ibn al-Qurashi tried to divert the accusations of anti-Mintash-agitation toward the Shafi'i chief judge Shihab al- Din al-Zuhri (d. 1393),150 the dispute was suddenly transferred to a different area when Shihab al-Din al-Zuhri incited the people present to bring forward their com- plaints about Ibn al-Qurashi's allegedly reprehensible conduct. The course of the as- sembly provides an excellent example of the way in which ethical and legal norms were used in an attempt to get rid of scholarly rivals. Ibn al-Qurashi, who had entered the assembly facing charges of opposing the holder of temporal power in Damascus, Mintash, left it as somebody who was found guilty of violating the rules of Islamic ethics and law by drinking alcohol and practicing pederasty.'5' By taking part in the legal action against Ibn al-Qurashi,'52 Ibn al-Husbani supported the case of Mintash against Sultan Barquq and, at the same time, made sure that Ibn al-Qurashi would not be able to reclaim the position of head at the Ashrafiyya school, the same position which he himself had occupied only some weeks before. 153 It was a little later that he also became Shafi'i deputy judge.'54 After the final defeat of</page><page sequence="20">222 Lutz Wiederhold Mintash in July 1391, however, Ibn al-Husbani proved to be a perfect opportunist when he was imprisoned for only a few days for having been involved in the action taken against al-Qurashi and having assumed his position at the Dar al-hadith al- Ashrafiyya by an order of Mintash.'55 After being set free, he had to pay 6,000 dirhams to become installed as a professor at two Damascene schools, the Kallasa'56 and the Falakiyya. In these positions he replaced members of the clan of al-Zaki, who ironically were dismissed because of their partisanship for Mintash.'57 However, he was not able to enjoy the new positions for long, because in the following month, September 1391, a decree arrived reinstalling Sharaf al-Din Ibn Khatib al-Haditha in the positions that Ibn al-Husbani recently had taken over.'58 In September 1395, somefuqahC7' complained about Ibn al-Husbani's financial prac- tices during his tenure as teacher at the Ashrafiyya and the Iqbaliyya'59 madrasas. When he was asked to present an account of income and expenditures (4isab) during his tenure, he went into hiding.'60 He returned to Damascus in May of the following year, and presented a decree (tawqic) signed by the sultan's dawadir that confirmed that Ibn al-Husbani be allowed to continue in the positions that he had been holding before he left and that nobody should oppose him in his claim to these positions.'6' The sources portray Ibn al-Husbani as an acknowledged scholar of the religious sciences who had a number of disciples.'62 He is said to have advocated the strict im- plementation of the rules of religious law. Further, a number of episodes that form a part of his biography convey the impression that Ibn al-Husbani was constantly seeking to improve his position in the hierarchy of the ulema. In the struggle for paid positions in the religious sphere, he was ready to cooperate with several Mamluk rep- resentatives, offering them his loyalty and service, thereby supporting their political aspirations. However, it seems that he understood the loyalty to certain Mamluks mainly as a means to further his own career and that he was able to change his loy- alties rather quickly. In light of our information, the assessment of Ibn al-Husbani's character as formulated by one of his contemporaries appears credible: the historian Ibn Hijji, who was one of Ibn al-Husbani's colleagues, remembered him as highly in- telligent and an excellent teacher. But he also disapproved of Ibn al-Husbani's avidity for paid positions and his constant association with representatives of the state.63 Al- Yasufi The fourth scholar mentioned in Barquq's decree is Sadr al-Din Sulayman ibn Yusuf ibn Muflih ibn Abi 'l-Wafa' al-Yasufi al-Muqaddasi al-Dimashqi.'64 Al-Yasufi was born in 1337. According to Ibn Hijji, he came to Damascus in his early years. There he found shelter at the Shamiyya madrasa'65 and attended lessons at the madrasa of Abu 'Amr, where he was instructed in the recitation of the Qur'an. Al-Yasufi was a diligent and industrious student and made rapid progress in his studies at various ma- drasas of Damascus. But at a certain point in his career he abandoned academic life and chose to live as an ascetic for a period of time. He performed as a preacher, and Ibn Qadi Shuhba suggests that he was subjected to punishment on several occasions because he propagated pious ideas in his sermons that seem to have been interpreted as a criticism of contemporary socio-political circumstances. Although not expressly stated, it can be assumed that the chronicler points to conflicts with Mamluk author-</page><page sequence="21">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 223 ities.166 Then his interest in hadith increased. He attended hadith lessons and visited several hadith specialists.'67 Ibn Hijji knew al-Yasufi personally and read hadith with him. In 1369, al-Yasufi traveled to Egypt to continue his studies there. A Mamluk official provided him with an office and, in addition to this, he took over the positions of Ibn Wuhayba when the latter was installed as judge in Tripolis. Then al-Yasufi went back to Damascus, where he further occupied himself with studies in hadith and functioned as mu'id at the madrasa al-Rukniyya, a position that he took over from Ibn al-Jabi al-Yasufi. He also issued legal opinions (afta). According to Ibn Hijji as quoted by Ibn Qadi Shuhba, al-Yasufi was intelligent and an able scholar both in disputation and research. But at the end of his life, Ibn Hijji continues, al-Yasufi preferred to interpret traditions (aithir) according to their literal meaning (zahir), and he openly criticized eminent personalities (al-kiba7r) for their wrongful conduct. He was imprisoned during the fitna Zahiriyya, remained in prison for eleven months, and died as a prisoner in August 1387.168 The biographical accounts of the four Zahiri scholars mentioned in Barquq's decree of 1382, while differing remarkably in detail, have proved informative not only con- cerning the relevance of the relationships between members of the learned elite for the functioning of Mamluk society, but also with regard to the other objectives of this study-that is, the reappraisal of the relationship between ulema and representatives of temporal power and an interpretation of the meaning of the term "Zahiri" at the time under examination. Apart from the main issues of the present study, it is note- worthy that, to our knowledge, none of the "Zahiri" scholars mentioned here com- posed a significant literary work. In view of the focus of Western scholarship on those personalities who distinguished themselves as authors in various fields of Muslim scholarship in the reconstruction of Islamic history, it needs to be pointed out that the fitna Zahiriyya provides another example of the fact that the history of Islam was shaped to a considerable degree by individuals whose names were not immortalized in literary works of lasting importance. CONCLUSION The starting point of this study was a "revolt of the Zahiris" in Damascus in 1386. Based on the critical analysis of a previous description of the fitna Zahiriyya in Western scholarship and a fresh interpretation of relevant sources, the text presented a more complete chronology of events than hitherto available and historical data which we considered useful in reconstructing the religious-political context of the fitna. With reference to the three main objectives of our examination as formulated in the introduction, the following conclusions can be drawn: First, the term "Zahiri" had a variety of connotations at the time under examina- tion. In the sphere of religious-legal learning, it denoted a legal doctrine that al- though occasionally cited without signs of disapproval in legal argumentation-was rejected by the majority of scholars of the established Sunni madhhabs. An analysis of the biographies of the four scholars who were denoted as Zahiris in Barquq's decree of 1382 and of Ahmad al-Burhan a central figure of thefitna Zahiriyya- confirmed Goldziher's observation that some of these ulema engaged in the study of</page><page sequence="22">224 Lutz Wiederhold Zahiri ideas. Yet we have also demonstrated that the rebellious Zahiri scholars of Damascus in their majority were adherents of the Shafi'i school of law and cannot be considered as having constituted or represented a Zahiri group in the sense of a particular madhhab.169 The biographies of the Zahiris by and large resembled the vitae of many other scholars belonging to the established Sunni schools of law. It is true that some of the Zahiris were described as having displayed an exceptional in- terest in the science of Prophetic tradition,'70 or as having voted for a strict adherence to the rules of hadith in social and political practice.'7' But these attitudes were not necessarily a consequence of Zahiri intentions. Most important, the main objective of the fitna Zahiriyya was not the revival of the extinct Zahiri school, as stated by Goldziher, but the overthrow of al-Zahir Barquq's regime and the installation of a politically independent caliph with the unlimited religious and political authority of the first leaders of the Muslim community. The exclusion of Zahirism as a legal doc- trine from the Sunni consensus long before the Mamluk era rendered the description of a particular scholar as Zahiri a serious accusation of non-conformity. Some of the protagonists of the fitna had been in conflict with members of the legal-religious elite and with representatives of temporal power on various occasions. Their descrip- tion as Zahiris could to some extent be understood as a label that was used in order to stigmatize them as scholarly rivals or political adversaries. In any case, in the con- text of the fitna the description of a particular scholar as Zahiri did not exclusively indicate his adherence to Zahiri tenets but also his sympathy for certain religious- political concepts. Second, our sources suggest that differences in social and professional status shaped the relationship between individual members of the learned elite. In the second half of the 14th century, the number of positions at religious and social institutions of the urban centers of the Mamluk empire was too small to provide every scholar with a constant salary or other kinds of social security, such as food and housing. Paid positions were therefore often the subject of fierce competition among the ulema.'72 In this competition, a scholar had two principal aims-namely, to prevent scholarly rivals from occupying a particular office for example, by presenting himself as socially or scholarly superior and to secure the support of those who could pave the way to a salaried position or, in certain political situations, who had the final say in distributing these positions (i.e., Mamluk officials).173 With respect to direct schol- arly competition, our study has confirmed the importance of a particular scholar's "social" and "cultural capital" for his career.174 At the same time, our material sug- gests that we must not imagine scholarly competition for salaried positions as a fair exchange of arguments in which the more educated or the quick-witted was always successful.'75 In order to prevent others from acquiring or keeping a salaried position or a certain privilege such as the right to issuefatwds-ulema pursued a variety of tactics, a main objective of which was to prove another scholar's lack of aptitude for a religious office. The sources suggest that denunciation of a person's doubtful moral conduct and accusations of incorrectness in financial matters or of scholarly incom- petence and lacking qualifications were methods not only of defending the territory of the learned elite against unwelcome intruders in general, but also of competing for certain positions and privileges. The context of the fitna Zahiriyya shows that a scholar's political views and doctrinal positions were also important criteria in the</page><page sequence="23">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 225 struggle for social and professional superiority. Accusations of adherence to a legal- religious doctrine that was rejected by the majority of the contemporary ulema and involvement in unsuccessful attempts at deposing the current ruler could be used against a scholar in the struggle for salaried positions and other social privileges. Third, as to the relationship between the military and scholarly elite in Mamluk society, our examination of the fitna and its context has confirmed the thesis that Mamluks and ulema did not constitute two monolithic groups that acted indepen- dently of or in opposition to each other. On various occasions, members of the two groups formed temporary alliances in order to realize personal or factional aims.176 Mamluk officials could provide representatives of the learned elite with influential positions in the sphere of religious and legal administration and expected them to legitimize their political claims in return. Scholarly opposition against the sultan and Mamluk officials was sporadic, related to particular incidents, sometimes motivated by personal aims, and voiced by small groups of ulema or individuals only. It could originate from certain doctrinal convictions such as the belief in the necessity of a strong caliphate. It could, however, also be motivated by social objectives. Ambi- tious scholars who were not able to further enhance their position in the hierarchy of the learned and religious officeholders in the process of scholarly competition offered religious legitimation to Mamluk officers who rebelled against the sultan and then replaced their rivals in paid positions after a successful revolt.177 At the same time, the context of the fitna Zahiriyya suggests that Mamluk officials could count on the assistance of established ulema in silencing political protest of certain scholars. Co- operation between the two elites may also be observed in the sphere of religious doc- trine, where Mamluk authorities more often than not supported the Sunni elite in persecuting non-conformist scholars and commoners when requested to do so.178 Altogether, opposition against and support of temporal authority was motivated by a particular scholar's personal views and objectives, which could be social and doc- trinal at the same time. The biographical material that we studied in the context of the fitna suggests that, occasionally, pragmatic and career-oriented ulema chose to support certain political and doctrinal positions in order to accomplish social and professional aims. However, as we have seen, the main impetus of thefitna Zahiriyya was a religious-political one-namely, the vision of re-establishing the caliph as the religious and political leader of the Muslim community. Finally, an interesting aspect of the Zahiri conspiracy against Barquq is its de- scription as afitna. In the Mamluk era, the termfitna, which often carried the mean- ing "trial" or "temptation" in the QurDan, could denote sexual temptation-a source of personal unrest and a threat to moral order179-as well as political disturbances whose aim was in conflict with the principles of Muslim faith. Because one of the principles propagated by the Sunni establishment was to obey a sovereign who did not violate the rules as formulated in the Qur'an and the sunna, open protest against temporal authority could also be subsumed under the term fitna under certain cir- cumstances.180 Fitna sometimes also denoted the rebellion of Mamluk officers against the sultan-that is, a series of armed actions in which a number of soldiers took part. In the sphere of religious learning, fitna often stood for the competition over paid positions (mansab) among the ulema.181 With regard to thefitna Zahiriyya, it can be concluded that the term neither described a major upheaval in which larger parts of</page><page sequence="24">226 Lutz Wiederhold the population or armed forces took part nor a dispute over a particular office. Rather, it circumscribed the turbulence caused by the plan of a few conspirators to remove Sultan Barquq from office because they refused to accept his rule as legitimate. However, several facts suggest that the common people (camma) played a certain, if mostly quiet, part in the events. The reader may recall that some of the scholars involved in the fitna were described as prominent preachers able to influence their audiences. There was, consequently, always the possibility that they could agitate the masses to take action against the Mamluk authorities.182 Furthermore, the imprison- ment of a Mamluk official who was venerated by the populace, such as Baydamur, in- volved the risk of provoking the 'dmma. As a matter of fact, the sources point to a certain fear among the Mamluk authorities that the populace could be turned against them by religious agitators if they made the wrong move. Also, a major military conflict could have developed if the conspirators had coordinated their action with bedouin tribes more successfully. To conclude, the fitna Zahiriyya was not an attempt to revive an extinct legal doc- trine but, rather, a protest of a group of religious scholars against what was seen as the cynical recourse to religious-political ideals for the legitimation of political power by Sultan Barquq. The examination of the fitna and its context has demonstrated once more that, in order to understand the functioning of Mamluk society in general and the relationship between Mamluks and ulema and between individual members of the learned elite in particular, it seems essential to analyze the close link between religious doctrinal convictions and particular socio-political motives.

Chamberlain adduces M. G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam. Conscience and History in a World Civilization, 2:64, as an example of a strict dichotomization of Mamluk society in Western historiography. 2See, for example, Carl F Petry, Protectors or Pretorians? The Last MamlUk Sultan and Egypt's Wain- ing as a Great Power (New York: New York University Press, 1994), 32. The two external powers threat- ening the Mamluk empire were the Mongols and Christians, while feuds of Mamluk rivals and attacks of bedouin tribes on towns and settlements can be described as internal threats to the political stability of the state. 3Chamberlain, Knowledge and Social Practice, 6; Boaz Shoshan, "The 'Politics of Notables' in Medi- eval Islam," Asian and African Studies 20 (1986): 180-8 1. 4See the critique of Laoust's notion of Mamluk society in R. Stephen Humphreys, Islamic History, A Framework of Inquiry, rev. ed. (London: I. B. Tauris, 1995), 196. Chamberlain holds the opinion that the</page><page sequence="25">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 227 strict focus on formal groups in writing the history of the Middle East is a consequence of applying meth- odologies of European history to this region (Chamberlain, Knowledge and Social Practice, 21, 24). On "problem-oriented" versus "source-oriented" historical studies, see John Tosh, The Pursuit of History, 2nd ed. (London: Longman, 1991), 54-55. 5It has been pointed out that the notion of Mamluk society as divided into two separate spheres of mil- itary and religious elites may also be based on such models. Ulrich Haarmann, "Der Arabische Osten im spaten Mittelalter 1250-1517," in Geschichte der arabischen Welt, ed. Ulrich Haarmann, 2nd ed. (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1991), 253. 6In this, the present examination builds on the results of previous studies that have demonstrated that the social domains of Mamluks and ulema intersected at various points. Some of them have shown that individual Mamluks took great pains to be accepted into the community of the pious and learned. See Ulrich Haarmann, "Arabic in Speech, Turkish in Lineage: Mamluks and their Sons in the Intellectual Life of Fourteenth-Century Egypt and Syria," Journal of Semitic Studies 33 (1988): 81-114; Jonathan Berkey, "'Silver Threads among Coal'-a Well-Educated Mamluk of the Ninth/Fifteenth Century," Studia Islam- ica 73 (1991): 109-25; idem, The Transmission of Knowledge in Medieval Cairo. A Social History of Islamic Education (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992), esp. 146-60; Chamberlain, Knowl- edge and Social Practice, 49. Further, it has been suggested that the influence of outstanding ulema on matters of politics and temporal power was, at times, significant. See Humphreys, Islamic History, 150. Also, some studies have concluded that ulema and Mamluks cooperated for the sake of internal political stability. See Ira M. Lapidus, Muslim Cities in the Later Middle Ages (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1967), 107-15; Joan E. Gilbert, "Institutionalization of Muslim Scholarship and Profes- sionalization of the 'Ulama in Medieval Damascus," Studia Islamica 52 (1984): 105-34, esp. 127, 132; Humphreys, Islamic History, 202. 7For a similar conclusion, see Chamberlain, Knowledge and Social Practice, 6. 81bid., esp. 91-107; Berkey, The Transmission of Knowledge, 95-127. 9Carl Brockelmann, Geschichte derArabischen Litteratur [sic].

Another study that must be mentioned here, although the present author so far has been unable to get hold of it, is Y. Linant de Bellefonds, "Ibn Hazm et la zahirisme juridique," Revue Algeri- enne (Revue de la Facultj de Droit dAlger) 1 (1960). A recent Arabic study dealing, among other things, with Ibn Hazm's legal thought is Muhammad cAbdallah Abu Su'aylik, al-Imam Ibn Hazm al-Zahiri imam ahl al-Andalus (Damascus: Dar al-qalam, 1995). 12GAL 2:89; Suppl. 2:105. Occasionally, in the biographical literature individuals with an inclination to Zahiri thought are mentioned. It is, however, difficult to reconstruct the nature of the Zahirism men- tioned in short biographical notes. A common trait of most of the Zahiri scholars is their extraordinary interest in hadith. In addition to examples mentioned later, see, for example, the entry on Ahmad ibn Tahir ibn 'Isa al-Shariqi (d. 1137 or 1145) in Ibn Farhiin, al-Dibdj al-mudhahhabfl ma'rifat a'yan 'ulamd' al- madhhab (Cairo: 'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Salam Shaqrun, 1351 A.H.), 45. 13GAL 2:335; Suppl. 2:464. 14On al-Sha'rani's attitude toward the various madhhabs, see Michael Winter, Society and Religion in Early Ottoman Egypt (New Brunswick, London: Transaction Books, 1982), 236-41.

Ibn Taymiyya's refusal to accept any consensus (jma') after the consensus of the Companions of the Prophet has been described as identical with the Zahiri concept of ijmd'. See Joseph Schacht, "The Schools of Law and Later Developments of Jurisprudence," in Law in the Middle East, ed. Majid Khadduri, Herbert Liebesny (Washington, D.C.: The Middle East Institute, 1955), 57-84, esp. 68; idem, An Introduction to Islamic Jurisprudence, 64. 21Goldziher, Die Zdhiriten, 196-202. Goldziher also demonstrated that al-Maqrizi (GAL 2:38; Suppl. 2:36) must have been notorious for his Zahirism among his contemporaries. At least, his fellow historian Ibn Taghribirdi mentioned al-Maqrizi's inclinations to Zahirism in a derogatory manner (Goldziher, Die Zdhiriten, 194). As demonstrated by Chejne, certain Sunni scholars displayed sympathies for Ibn Hazm's ideas (Ibn Hazm, 7-10). 22Even Taj al-Din al-Subki, the Shafi'i who, in his Tabaqdt al-shdfi'iyya, disapproved of Zahiri ideas as represented by Ibn Hazm, quotes this Zahiri in afatwaz dealing with the offense of blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad (sabb al-rasid). However, it needs to be mentioned here that Ibn Hazm started his scholarly career as a Shafi'i. See al-Subki, al-Fatawaz, 1:587; EI, s.v. "Ibn Hazm." A 13th-century Shafi'i scholar in whose works an element of Zahirism has been identified is Abu Shama (665/1268). See G. H. A. Juynboll, The Authenticity of the Tradition Literature (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1969), 91. Other ex- amples for the impact of Ibn Hazm on scholars who were not denoted as Zahiris are provided by Chejne, Ibn Hazm, 14-19. According to Coulson, in modern times, the Zahiri doctrine was used for the for- mulation of legal rules by way of exercising takhayyur. See Noel J.

It may be surmised that both Ibn Farhun and al-Sinjari, when stating the existence of Zahirism at their time, had in mind the circulation of Zahiri ideas rather than particular scholars or organizational structures such as legal schools. 25Ibn Farhun, Dibdj, 89.

In the passage mentioned, he states that some Shafi'is held that opinions of Dawud al-Zahiri concerning usul al-fiqh that contradict a consensus of other scholars (that is khilaf) are to be taken into consideration when formulating an ijmC'. 28GAL 2:242; Suppl. 2:342. 29Ibn Khaldiin, al-Muqaddima (Beirut: al-Matba'a al-adabiyya, 1900), 446-47. An English translation of the passage quoted can be found in Franz Rosenthal, The Muqaddima. An Introduction to History (Lon- don: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1967), 3:5-6. It needs to be pointed out that, in the passage cited earlier, Ibn al-Salah does not refer to any contemporary Zahiri scholar and that his remarks seem to add little to our knowledge concerning the relevance of Zahiri ideas to the legal-theological discourse in the 13th cen- tury. But at least the passage might be taken as a justification for quoting Zahiri scholars in legal argu- mentation at Ibn al-Salah's time. 30Professorships and other paid positions in the sphere of religious learning were often confined by donors to members of a particular madhhab. We don't know, however, of any such position that was designed for a Zahiri scholar in Mamluk times. 31Goldziher, Die .Zahiriten, 195. This revolt is also adduced as an example of later Zahirism by Stroth- mann (EII, s.v. "al-Zahiriya"), and in Cheikh Si Hamza Boubakeur, Traite moderne de Theologie Islamique (Paris; Maisonneve &amp; Larose, 1993), 383-84. 32GAL 2:51; Suppl. 2:50.</page><page sequence="27">A "Zahiri Revolt" in Damascus in 1386 229 33To our knowledge, Emir Sharaf al-Din Musa al-Zanki is mentioned only once in the chronicle of Ibn Qadi Shuhba for the time under examination-namely, on the occasion of his death in October 1386 (Shawwal 788; see Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Tdrikh, 210, where the nisba al-Turki is given instead of al-Zanki). He died two months after the fitna Zahiriyya. However, there is no information whatsoever that would suggest an involvement of Sharaf al-Din Musa in the fitna or any direct link to the persons involved in it. According to al-Maqrizi, a certain Sharaf al-Din Musa ibn al-Fafa was ustaddr of Emir Aytamish. It is noteworthy that al-Maqrizi also denotes him as one of the heads of the Zahiriyya (al-Maqrizi, al-Suliik, 3, 2:558). 34Goldziher, Die Zdhiriten, 194. 35GAL 2:41; Suppl. 2:39. 36Goldziher, Die Zdhiriten, 194. 37Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani, al-Durar al-kdminaft acydn al-mi'a al-thdmina (Hayderabad, 1928), 2:168. 38Goldziher, Die Zdhiriten, 194. 9A more detailed version of al-Burhan's biography in Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani's Inba' al-ghumr offers deeper insight into the nature and motives of al-Burhan's Zahirism and will be discussed later. 40Donald P.

Hourani has pointed to this fact in general in "The Present State of Islamic and Middle Eastern Historiography," in Albert Hourani, Europe and the Middle East (London: Macmillan, 1982), 161-96, esp. 165. At the same time, the studies mentioned point to the fact that the character of the chronicles mirrors the professional and local circumstances under which their authors lived and that the chronicles therefore differed in content. 41Our study is mainly based on information from Ibn Qadd Shuhba, Tdrikh; Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani, Inba' al-ghumi bi-abna' al-'umr, ed. Hasan Habashi (Cairo, 1969-1972); idem, al-Durar al-kamina; al- Sakhawi, al-Daw al-lami'; al-Maqrizi, al-Suluk; Ibn Iyas, Bada'i' al-zuhur, ed.

However, due to the particular interests and the location of their authors, some of the chronicles do provide information that cannot be found in others. 42GAL 1:50; Suppl. 1:50. 43Sometimes mentioned in the sources as Ibn Abi 'l-'Izz, 'Ali ibn 'Ali ibn Muhammad al-Adhra'i al- Dimashqi. See Ibn HIajar al-'Asqalani, al-Durar al-kimina, 3:87. 44"I'tirada cilmiyya ... wa-ata bi-ashya' munkara," Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 89. 45This 'Ali ibn Aybak could not be identified in the biographical literature. 46Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Tdrikh, 89. 47Ibid. In all probability, the decree culminated in a similar attack on Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali fol- lowers of Ibn Taymiyya in the Syrian capital, but at this point Ibn Qad1 Shuhba, unfortunately, cuts short the citation of the document. Instead, the case of Ibn al-'Izz is taken up again by him. This, however, is not of interest in the present context. 48It seems noteworthy that we know of other cases in Islamic history where certain groups of ulema attempted to gain the support of temporal rulers against scholarly groups abiding by dissident theological opinions. See Humphreys, Islamic History, 159. 49This can be ascribed to the fact that chronicles such as al-Maqrizi's Suluk and Ibn Taghribirdi's al- Nujum al-zdhira focus mainly on events in Egypt. The silence of some of the sources concerning thefitna is also discernible in an early Western historiography of the Mamluk era, namely, Weil's Geschichte der Chalifen. Weil mentions the dismissal of Baydamur as governor of Damascus-an important episode of the fitna-but does not elucidate the developments that led to his removal (Gustav Weil, Geschichte der Chalifen (Stuttgart, 1846-62), 4/1:545). 501bn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 186. As mentioned earlier, Goldziher provides a biographical sketch of Ahmad al-Burhan al-Zahiri drawing on al-Manhal al-safl by Ibn Taghribirdi, but fails to point to the fact that this Ahmad (al-Burhan al-Zahiri) and the Ahmad (al-Zahiri) who played a prominent part in the Dam- ascene fitna are one and the same person. The biographical material on Ahmad as provided in Ibn Qadi</page><page sequence="28">230 Lutz Wiederhold Shuhba's chronicle can be assumed to be more authentic than that presented in Manhal al-sqfi for reasons outlined earlier. 5'According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba (ibid.), he used to study Ibn Hazm's Muhalld, afiqh manual that was composed when Ibn Hazm was still following the Shafi'i doctrine (GAL 1:400; Suppl. 1:695). On Ibn Hazm's possible motives for changing madhhabs, see Chejne, Ibn Hazm, 43-46. 52It remains unclear why Ahmad al-Burhan himself was not mentioned in Barquq's decree. 53On (Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn Sanjar) Ibn al-Himsi's role in thefitna, see Ibn Qadd Shuhba, Tdrikh, 304; Ibn Hajar, al-Durar al-kdmina, 1:514. 54These events will be discussed later. On the installation of al-Mutawakkil, see Weil, Geschichte der Chalifen, 4/1:509. 55Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 363-64. 56Ibid., 226-27. 57Ibid., 186-87. 581bn Qadi Shuhba mentions three facts as having nourished the sultan's suspicion of Baydamur: (1) Baydamur's letter had arrived only after that of the hajib and the nd'ib al-qal'a; (2) in his letter he had played down (hawwana) the events of the whole incident, whereas the two officers in their letter had suggested that he had treated the conspirators with respect (fakhkhama); (3) other unspecified circum- stantial evidence (qard'in) supported the thesis of Baydamur's sympathy for the conspirators (Ibn Qadd Shuhba, Thrikh, 188). 59Ibid., 409. It may be noted that, according to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, it was not Baydamur but his son Muhammad Shah who supported the Zahiris. 60Ibid., 397. 61In October (Shawwal), the new governor, Ishiqtamir al-Maridani (d. 791/1389, see Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 306) was installed. According to al-Maqrizi (al-Suluik, 3, 2:549), the order to imprison Baydamur was sent to Damascus on 26 September (1 Ramadan). 620f course, Ibn Qibjaq could likewise be viewed as fulfilling his duty of controlling the governor and limiting his political influence. On the hajib as the second in the Mamluk hierarchy after the governor in the provinces of the Mamluk empire, see EII, s.v. "Hadjib." 63Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 188. Ibn Qadi Shuhba describes Amin al-Din al-Hanbali al-Ba'labakki as a person who was often involved in political disturbances. In the conflict between Sultan al-Zahir Barquq and Emir Mintash, he took sides with the latter. When in 1391 the sultan regained control over Damascus and Syria, his adversaries were forced to withdraw and surrender. Also in Baalbek, Ibn al-Harami, an ally of Mintash, left the citadel in August (Ramadan 793) of this year, probably because he wanted to avoid confrontation with the sultan's army that was about to leave Damascus for Baalbek at that time. Even before Ibn al-Harami had left Baalbek, Amin al-Din Ibn al-Najib, who had supported him, was killed by a certain Ibn al-Mahbub Ba'labakki (ibid., 382-83, 419-20). 64Ibid., 187-88.

It seems noteworthy that he is said to have studied al-Bukhari's hadith collection. 70This episode is not mentioned in Ibn Qadi Shuhba's chronicle-a fact that illustrates how various sources for the fitna do complement one another. Al-Maqrizi does not mention his immediate authority for his account. 71"Naq1 al-mamlaka wa-'l-du'd' li-imam qurashi." 72Al-Maqrizi, Kitab al-Suluk, ed.

For further examples of Barquq's awareness of the importance of the caliph's consent for the legitimacy of power, see ibid., 266, 273, 326. It can be noted here that Barquq's adversaries among the officers also referred back to the authority of the caliph to legitimize their claim to political power; see ibid., 294, 321; Ibn Hajar, Inba' al-ghumr, 2:344. 82Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 304. 83Ibid., 110. 84Al-Sakhawi, al-Daw' al-lami', 7:168; Ibn Hajar, Inba' al-ghumr, 2:343-45. 85Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 109; Weil, Geschichte der Chalifen, 4/1:543-54. 86See Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 110, n. 3, n. 4, 201.

In contrast to Barquq, Yalbugha al-Nasiri is said to have treated the caliph with great respect. Lewis has described caliphal suc- cession at the time under examination in El2, s.v. "'Abbasids." However, according to our sources, caliphal succession proceeded as follows: 1377-83, al-Mutawakkil 'ala 'l-lah Muhammad; 1383-86, al-Wathiq bi-'l-lah Rukn al-Din 'Umar ibn Ibrahim-son of the Caliph al-Mu'tasim (r. 1377); 1386-89, al-Musta'sim bi-'l-lah Muhyi al-Din Zakariyya ibn al-Mu'tasim bi-'l-lah-brother of the Caliph al-Wathiq bi-'l-lah 'Umar (not al-Mu'tasim!); 1389-1405, al-Mutawakkil 'ala 'l-lah Muhammad. 92EII, s.v.

Brill, 1936-88), 2:70. 93This was not the result of a religious-political movement but a consequence of a conflict between different factions of the Mamluks; Haarmann, "Der Arabische Osten," 230. 94As governor of the Buhayra and the Wajh al-Bahri provinces, Qurt frequently had military encoun- ters with belligerent bedouins of Lower Egypt. Later, it is stated, he changed his attitude toward them and was in agreement (wata'a) with them; see Ibn Qadd Shuhba, Tdrikh, 124. On the conspirators' contacts with bedouin tribes, see also Ibn Hajar, Inba' al-ghumr, 2:344. 95Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 110, 186. Heidemann also mentions the involvement of bedouin tribes in the restoration of the caliphate after the fall of Bagdad; see Heidemann, Das Aleppiner Kalifat, 95. 96In this context, it can be mentioned that the black color of the Abbasids had a symbolic value that became obvious in religious ceremonies also in Mamluk times; see L. A. Mayer, Mamluk Costume (Geneva: Albert Kundig, 1952), 12. Al-Maqrizi reports that a khutba was usually read by a preacher wearing a black robe (al-Suluk, 3, 2:549). On black as a symbol of allegiance to the Abbasid dynasty in pre-Mamluk times, see Sh. Guthrie, Arab Social Life in the Middle Ages (London: Saq! Books, 1996), 74. In light of our con- clusion, and keeping in mind the fact that a number of the Zahiris involved in the fitna belonged to the Shafi'i school of law, general assumptions regarding the attitude of certain madhhabs toward the political authority of the caliphate of Cairo need to be re-investigated; cf.

According to Ibn Hajar, this behavior accounts for the hostility with which Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi was met by some of his con- temporaries (Ibn Hajar, al-Durar al-kamina, 3:194).

Shortly after Ibn al-Husbani had taken over in June 1385 (Jumada I 787), Ibn al-Jazari (d. 833/1429) presented a doc- ument affirming his right to this position. For a purpose not specified by the chronicler, but certainly not a friendly one, Ibn al-Jazari, whose installation document had arrived before that of Ibn al-Husbani, had preferred to withhold it until Ibn al-Husbani had read his first khutba (ibid., 159). 1381n the words of the judge of Damascus: 'Ankara qawl al-qa-'il anna 'l-amr li-'l-la-h min qabl wa-ba'd."

See Lutz Wiederhold, "Blasphemy Against the Prophet Muhammad and His Compan- ions (sabb al-rasil, sabb al-sahaba): The Introduction of Theological Doctrine into Shafici Legal Liter- ature and its Relationship to Legal Practice under Mamluk Rule," Journal of Semitic Studies 62 (1997): 39-71, esp. 68, n. 148. 1391bn Qadi Shuhba, Tdrikh, 181. 140There seems to be an inconsistency in Ibn Qadd Shuhba's account when he reports that, on this occasion, the position of a supervisor of the Aminiyya was given to cAla' al-Din Ibn Naqib al-Ashraf. According to the chronicler's account, Ibn al-Husbani had to dispense with the responsibilities of a super- visor (nazir) of the Aminiyya in favor of Badr al-Din al-Zura'i in May 1382 (Rabic I 784). Perhaps he had regained them in the course of time and Ibn Qadi Shuhba failed to mention this (ibid., 82, 160). 1410n this mosque, see Sack, Damaskus, 63 ff., 67, 96. 142Shihab al-Din Ibn Hijji, the chronicler, became teacher at the Aminiyya, assuming the position of Ibn al-Husbani after the latter's imprisonment; Ibn Qadd Shuhba, Tdrikh, 161-62, 163, 164. l43cUmar ibn Raslan al-Bulqini; see Ibn al-cImad, Shadhardt al-dhahab, 7:51; Ibn Hajar, Inba' al- ghumr, 2:245-47.</page><page sequence="32">234 Lutz Wiederhold 144Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrikh, 247. Al-Bulqini was a great admirer of Ibn al-Husbani and considered him the scholar with the strongest memory for prophetic tradition in Damascus at this time; see Ibn Hajar, Inbd' al-ghumr, 2:524. 145The mosque referred to here is probably the Tawba Mosque, which, according to Sack, was situated in the 'Uqayba quarter (Sack, Damaskus, 28). If this is true, Ibn al-Husbani assumed the position that had been taken away from him three years before. 146Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Tdrikh, 284, 287.

However, Ibn al-Husbani managed to obtain other positions in the sphere of teaching, such as one at the Fathiyya school (Sack, Damaskus, 112, mentions a madrasa al-Fathiyya [also al-Qaymariyya] as dated in 1156/1743-44), which he left to Sharaf al-Din al-Summaqi al-Husbani in January 1392 (Rab!' I 794). In August 1392 (Shawwal 794), he added another chapter to the story of his rivalry with Ibn al-Jazari when he ousted the latter's son from the position of khatpb of the mosque of 'Uqayba. And, as in the earlier case of the father al-Jazari, this conflict also had to be settled by a governmental decree (tawqic) dividing the position in question between al-Jazari and Ibn al-Husbani in order to put an end to the quarrels (ibid., 521, 552). 159Sack, Damaskus, 97. 160Ibn Qadd Shuhba, Tdrikh, 557. 16'Ibid., 585-86. 162Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-'Akkari, known as Ibn al-'Alam (d. 808/1405), who was also a companion of Ahmad Ibn al-Jabi al-Yasufi (Ibn Hajar, Inba-' al-ghumr, 2:331).

On the schools, see Sack, Damaskus, 95, 98. 166Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Thrlkh, 228. 167Among them were some of al-Fakhr ibn al-Bukhari's (d. 690/1291, see GAL 1:366; Suppl. 1:625) disciples. 1681bn Qadd Shuhba, Tdrikh, 228-29. 169Interestingly enough, no Hanafi or Maliki scholars are mentioned as having participated in thefitna Zahiriyya. However, Goldziher mentions a Hanafi scholar with Zahiri inclinations living at the time under examination; see Goldziher, Die Za-hiriten, 196. The Zahiris did not form a coherent group abiding by the same doctrinal tenets. In one case, the sources suggest intellectual differences between two members of the "Zahiri" faction-Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi and Ahmad al-Zahiri. The fact that some of the Zahiris had studied with the same teachers seems to be of little importance in this context. Zayn al-Din al-Qurashi, Ibn al-Jabi, and Ibn al-Husbani were introduced into the science of hadith by 'Imad al-Din al-Husbani (d. 1376) the father of Ibn al-Husbani. On him, see 'U. Kahhala, Mucjam al-mu'allifin (Beirut: Dar ihya' al-turath al-'arabi, 1957), 2:269. The first two scholars had in common two other teachers: 'Ala' al-Din Hijji and Baha' al-Din al-Ikhmimi. Shams al-Din al-Mizzi was the teacher of Ibn al-Husbani and al- Yasufi. However, none of these teachers was known as a supporter of Zahiri ideas. 1701bn Hajar, Inba-' al-ghumr, 2:331.

However, it remains unclear whether the four ulema mentioned in the decree of 1382 had already been identified by Barquq as political adversaries at that point or whether they had been reported to the sultan as adherents of Zahiri ideas by other scholars. Be that as it may, there is little doubt that the sultan per- sonally cared little about the doctrinal opinions of the Zahiri conspirators in 1386. The attempt to establish an independent caliph did concern him only insofar as he suspected influential officers of attempting to seize the opportunity to pursue their own aims by supporting religious troublemakers, thus threatening in- ternal political stability. Barquq's questions during the interrogation of Ahmad al-Burhan and the severe measures taken against Baydamur illustrate this in sufficient clarity. Mamluk officials were not inclined to take the initiative in persecuting non-conformist ulema.

Chamberlain's translation of fitna as "elite competition" is general enough to describe internal conflicts between members of the military elite as well as between particular ulema; ibid., 168. 182Shoshan has pointed to the fact that we don't have any proof for the ulema's leadership of popular revolts in Mamluk Egypt (Shoshan, "The 'Politics of Notables,"' 197). However, the behavior of Mamluk officials during thefitna could be interpreted as suggesting that the Mamluks thought of certain ulema as potential leaders of political revolts.</page></plain_text>
