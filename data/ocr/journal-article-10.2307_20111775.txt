<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theses on Power and Science 473 COMMENTS ON Mr. USHENKO'S THESES I Elizabeth Lane Beardsley i. The reification of power proposed by Mr. Ushenko is defended by a number of arguments drawn from quite dif ferent fields. The contention that considerations as various as these support a single conclusion would be philosophically important, if it could be justified. But it seems to me that the reification actually carried out here is not one process, but two, for "power" is a word used by Mr. Ushenko in two fundamentally different ways. 2. In the first place, the term "power" is used to refer to processes which are held to go on at particular times, and to be accessible to direct experience. It is not clear to me why our experiences of activity are not "explicit" (i), or why they are not to be regarded as manifested to the senses (i); but possibly these assertions could be defended on the ground that the experiences in question are phenomenologically distinctive in some way. 3. A more serious difficulty concerns the exclusion from "actuality" of "power" in this first sense. Here we must especially note the statement that a tendency, though observable, "is latent because it is distinguishable from its actualisation" (1). Undoubtedly an earlier stage in a process is distinguishable from a later or from a culminating stage; moreover, the "directedness" of some processes seems to be given in experience, as is pointed out in (2). But to let these facts persuade us to speak of a process in an early stage as "not actualized" may increase the danger of confusing two meanings of "power." This I believe the present author has done in assuming that the observable forces of cohesion of Gestalt Psychology can be identified with the potentiality involved in the concept of disposition (3), Mr. Ushenko uses the word "power" to refer to both, and shows (in 5) that the words "power" and "potentiality" are interchangeable, in his usage. 4. The identification of "power" and "potentiality"</page><page sequence="2">474 Elizabeth Lane Beard sie y appears to be based on the view that the "actualization" of an observable process noted above is somehow the same concept as the "actualization" of a disposition. Such a view rests on a failure to see that dispositions and observable processes do not have the same kind of relation to the temporal order. My disposition to perform Act A is the fact that I shall do A whenever Condition C obtains; and, if this is a fact at all, its footing in reality is quite unaffected by the question whether, at a given time, C does obtain and A is performed. It may seem that we ought to find the problem of describing the ontological status of my disposition to do A especially puzzling in relation to those times when I am not actually doing A. This, hovewer, is a mistake. If we ought to be puzzled here at all, we ought to find actualized dispositions just as puzzling as unactualized ones, and just as much in need of locations in the temporal order. But dispositions, unlike processes, cannot occupy positions in the temporal order at all; and therefore the use of one term, like "power", to refer to these ultimately different kinds of entities, is quite misleading. 5. I think that the status of the problem of analyzing subjunctive conditionals assumes a subordinate importance in this context, in view of the difficulty already discussed. Inevitably, the flat statement that "the truth of a subjunctive conditional cannot be reduced to the truth of a truth-functional conditional" (or any combination of such conditionals) (4) will seem well-founded to some, and premature to others. It may turn out, however, that the analysis of the concept of disposi tion will require us to attend at least as closely to logical and epistemological differences between "categorical" and "hypo thetical" statements as to the better-publicized differences between subjunctive and indicative conditionals. 6. Why do we need to separate prediction from know ledge as drastically as seems to have been done in (6)? Pre diction is not a process taking place outside of knowledge: it is part of knowledge, namely, knowledge of the future. Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.</page><page sequence="3">Theses on Power and Science 475 II Herbert Feigl Mr. Ushenko considers dispositional concepts of the tendency and power type indispensable and irreducible. I submit that his conviction (that these concepts achieve something more than could be achieved by the concepts of state and law) derives from the following four considerations which I shall list and examine critically. i. In many cases, especially in the fields of biology, psychology and the social sciences neither the pertinent basic laws nor the relevant states (i.e., initial conditions) are known with sufficient completeness. Therefore thing-concepts ("con tinuants") and the terminology of powers, tendencies and dispositions serve as useful substitutes or promissory notes for more basic laws and states. This interpretation seems especially plausible if we venture to anticipate the future development in these sciences along the lines of the partial progress already plainly achieved in physics. But, even dis regarding the future, we must ask: what inore is expressed by "power" and "disposition" than the confirmable regularities of processes, or the patterns of what happens under what circumstances? 2. I am inclined to agree with Mr. Ushenko that the laws which underlie scientific explanations cannot be adequately explicated in terms of purely extensional general implications. The challenge of the analysis of subjunctive conditionals (see Chisholm, Goodman, Kneale, etc.) has convinced many of us (Burks, Hempel, Hofstadter, W. Sellars, etc.) that we need a logic of causal modalities. But since the analysis of causal modalities (see H. Reichenbach, Elements of Symbolic Logic, Ch. VIII; W. Sellars "Concepts as Involving Laws...," Phil, of Science, 1948; A. W. Burks, "The Logic of Causal Proposi tions," Mind, 1951, etc.) is essentially an exercise in the semantics of scientific language, there is no danger of a re gression to the sort of metaphysical interpretation of the causal relation which was definitively refuted by Hume and rightly stigmatized by Mach as "fetishistic" and "animistic." The "reification" of power of which Mr. Ushenko speaks so candidly</page><page sequence="4">476 Herbert Feizl seems to rae to arise out of a desire for "intuitive under standing," "insight," "empathy," all basically attempts at familiarization rather than explanation. The related prob lem [touched upon in Mr. Ushenko's thesis (6)] of how to account for the success of the scientific enterprise in terms of either pragmatistic or positivistic or realistic presuppositions may be resolved by a careful separation of contexts of inquiry. Again, I do not see how the ? by now extremely ambiguous ? term "power" helps in the elucidation of the space-time concept of Einstein and Minkowski. 3. Further, there is the unquestionable fact of the given ness in immediate experience of tendencies (goal directed strivings) and of our (often rather limited) power to direct our own affairs, or those of others. But is it not the philosopher's task to analyze (explicate) the precise meaning of these terms? If they are to be accepted as primitives or unanalyzables, there are two alternatives: a) we are intuitively acquainted with the meaning of these concepts and therefore they do not require explication; b) they are to function as undefined terms in a postulate system of some branch of science. The first altern ative is not acceptable, except in phenomenological psycho logy. Wherever we are confronted with behavior (be it of inorganic systems or of organisms) we would require some rules by which to test the presence or absence of tendencies, powers or potentialities. Once these rules are made (at least partially) explicit, they will give us an epistemic analysis of the meaning of the concepts at issue. The second alternative is entirely acceptable, provided that at least some of the derived concepts of the hypothetico-deductive theory are observationally or operationally grounded. This again will provide at least a partial explication of the "primitives" of the system. Immediately given tendencies may well be identified (synthetic, not analytic identity!) with some of the dispositions designated by concepts which are shorthand for regularities of behavior. I have sketched the semantics of such identifica tions in my article "The Mind-Body Problem in the Develop ment of Logical Empiricism," Revue Internationale de Philos. 11, 1950.) 4. Much of the temptation that the concepts of power</page><page sequence="5">Theses on Power and Science 477 and tendency hold for Mr. Ushenko seems due to the slippery verbal transition from "disposition to..." to "tendency toward ..." In this age of cybernetics there is little reason to impute the kind of purposiveness that characterizes human conscious striving to biological, physiological (let alone in organic) processes. The phrase "ideological mechanisms" is no longer a contradictio in adjecto. Many metaphysicians have metaphorically exploited the pictorial-emotional appeal of the phenomenological concepts of purpose, goal-direction and conscious intent for pseudo-explanations of not only the corresponding human behavior, but also of the behavior of lower order organisms and inorganic systems. We must reject these modes of thought as violations of the principles of inductive simplicity (parsimony). And, I trust, Mr. Ushenko would not resort to the extreme device of making his hypo theses proof against disproof, i.e., safe against disconfirmation, and thereby to render them scientifically meaningless. University of Minnesota. Ill Donald C. Williams Mr. Ushenko's position is as extreme as possible. The Aristotelian believes in Power, but holds that the actual is prior to the potential in several respects, one of them being that potentiality inheres in actualities ? actual things have the power to act. For Mr. Ushenko the potential is prior to the actual. Power is not just a thing's power to do but is the thing itself and the causal factor which does. There is nothing for it to do to, either, except other batches of power. What actuality there is, then, is epiphenomenal, the flare which blossoms round the impact of one power on another. Nevertheless I suggest that if his scheme can be carried through it must turn out only verbally different from the traditional view that these flares of actuality are the real sources from which radiate the power for the next causal stage.</page><page sequence="6">478 Donald C. Williams This postulation of power, not in place of but in addition to actuality, still has the notorious incredibility of every pro found dualism of being, and the special incredibility of a realm defined by a non-descriptive modality, what-can-be or tending-to-be. There is, for instance, no observable type specimen by which to frame its concept. Surely nobody has ever directly perceived a Power and how it pushes itself into realization. Hence is required that typical resort to merely verbal and synonymous definition exemplified when Mr. Ushenko calls Power an "agency." The notion of "Power" as a distinctive, independent, or primary category, deserving the capital letter, I think is profoundly wrong. There is nothing and could not conceivably be anything save what occupies the single ontological plane of actual existents. There remains Mr. Ushenko's striking list of scientific applications of the idea of power. They are reminiscent, however, of Leibniz's claim that facts about motion proved the truth of his metaphysics of Real Living Force, whereas they were, of course, quite neutral in that respect. If there is a way of interpreting so simple a power sentence as "I can wiggle my ears" in the indicative mood, it will assuredly suffice for all Mr. Ushenko's more impressive examples. I have here no scope to explain how such interpretation is possible, but then he had none to explain why it should be impossible. Harvard University. IV Adolf Gr?nbaum The "power" which Mr. Ushenko is asking us to reify is devoid of logical unity; it is an omnibus name applied desultorily in a variety of contexts. i. The contrast between power or tendency and "passive" sense data lies within the domain of actuality. For the ten dencies themselves, though distinguishable from their goals, must be felt and hence actual. Moreover, Mr. Ushenko's sound rejection of phenomenalistic constructionism in (6)</page><page sequence="7">Theses on Power and Science 479 entails the existence in actuality of a sector not coextensive with the class of actual sense data. And it is hardly clear that the distinction between power and passivity has any significance outside that sector of actuality which comprises immediate kinesthetic experience. Thus (1) and (2) serve only to call attention to a distinction within the phenomenal sector of actuality. 2. and 3. Mr. Ushenko did not show that the application of the kinesthetic notion of tendency to the interaction of bodies is more than a gratuitous anthropomorphism. Hence, in the context of describing the physical world and the Gestalt phenomena cited in (3), "power" must mean inter action, functional relatedness or organizational unity. Unless the appeal to psychoanalysis is merely a special case of the argument from disposition terms, the invocation of the Id here suggests an illicit identification of potential psychic states with psychic factors which are actual, though not directly observed. And the demand for reifying disposi tions does not yield a much-needed explanation of how the kinesthetic concept of tendency clarifies the logic of the dis position terms encountered in the physical sciences as distinct from psychology. It is only in connection with the sense data and feelings which he considers in (1) that Mr. Ushenko makes any mention at all of the empirical basis of our knowledge of potentiality. 5. In connection with quantum physics, "power" seems to be a name either for that part of actuality whose disclosure depends upon our procedures of observation or simply for unobserved actuality. 6. One must welcome Mr. Ushenko's requirement here that philosophical interpretations of scientific theories eschew departing from the literal tenor of the assertions of these theories, lest such interpretations become ad hoc. Phenome nalistic positivism fails to comply with this requirement (especially in its interpretation of the meaning of cosmogonie, geological and cosmological hypotheses). Accordingly, I am at one with Mr. Ushenko in rejecting phenomenalism in favor of realism both on this count and because phenomenalism fails to provide the intelligibility on which he rightly insists at the end of (6). But it should be pointed out that Mr. Ushenko's</page><page sequence="8">480 Adolf Gr?nbaum strictures here invalidate his own alternative to Einstein's con ception of science, which he rejects (cf. A. P. Ushenko, "Einstein's Influence on Contemporary Philosophy," in P. A. Schilpp (ed.), Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, Evanston, 1949). And the views which he expresses here in (6) require his repudiation of the many chapters in his various books in which the influence of Russell's positivistic Maxim of Logical Construction is pervasive. Lehigh University. V Y. H. Krikorian 1. The unqualified use of the term "power" implies unlimited power, omnipotence. Mr. Ushenko certainly does not mean omnipotence whenever he uses the term "power" especially when he applies it to certain areas. To make the concept of power more fruitful one has to be able to speak of it as greater or lesser. But the notion of greater or lesser power demands a careful operational, experimental definition, which Mr. Ushenko does not offer. Mr. Ushenko defines power as "a latent yet directing agency," as "a factor of in tegration," as "potentiality." One has here some of the ingredients of an experimental definition of "power," but since Mr. Ushenko does not formulate such a definition one cannot determine in any given situation what degree of power is in tended. 2. If one were to employ the concept of power not so much as an operational concept but as a comprehensive, pervasive, metaphysical one, as Mr. Ushenko seems to do, one would have to give a more coherent and clearer formulation than Mr. Ushenko does. Mr. Ushenko attempts to show how the concept of power applies to psychology, logic and modern physics; but his application is vague. Sometimes the notion of power has ideological implications, as when he applies it to psychology. Notions of "impressiveness," "Id," and "disposi tion" are teleological categories. At other times the notion of</page><page sequence="9">Theses on Power and Science 481 power is ateleological, as when he applies it to physics. Alternative "ways of separating space and time" and the fact that "only one of the two complementary aspects of nature can be exhibited at a given time" are ateleological con cepts, involving no purposive direction. Is power as poten tiality basically ideological, ateleological, both, or neutral? Mr. Ushenko's answer would certainly clarify his metaphysical outlook. 3. The concept of the "directing agency," which is crucial to Mr. Ushenko's notion of power, needs further amplification. Is Mr. Ushenko's "directing agency" akin to a vitalistic agency like Bergson's ?lan vital} If so, Mr. Ushenko should make more explicit the dualistic metaphysics which this notion of power would imply. But even more important, is it necessary to postulate an agency for the directing and integrating activity? Why postulate an unverifiable agency for this in tegration? Why not assign this process, say in psychology, to the organism as a whole? Mr. Ushenko suggests that power is verifiable, but what is verifiable is not a "directing agency," but an integrated process. The City College of New York. VI C. West Churchman 1. By way of example, I presume, the sense datum of a "red patch" is contrasted with the latent power of a ten ton truck suspended by cables. But doesn't the very actuality of the red patch depend for its meaning on the strongest sort of power, i.e., the power of light to produce an image? 2. Are sense data ever "enframed"? Doesn't the present moment entail the strongest possible tendency to become a future moment, and the sense datum of the present the strongest tendency to become a sense datum (changed or unchanged) of another moment? 3. As a matter of historical fact, did Gestalt psychology intend to sav that a figure is a combination of passive sense</page><page sequence="10">482 C. West Churchman data forces? If so, it was only a modification of, not in oppo sition to, associationist psychology. Some behaviorists believe that "disposition" and "habit" can be defined solely in terms of a frequency of past performance. Finally, "raising a logical problem" is not sufficient grounds, surely, for not avoiding the reification of dispositions. 4. Again, as a matter of historical fact, from com plementarity, does it follow that the unactualized aspect exists in the mode of power? 5. In sum, except for queries about historical fact, the thesis is sound, but can be infinitely strengthened if power is taken to be a sine qua non of sense data, just as the latter are necessary conditions for the former.
