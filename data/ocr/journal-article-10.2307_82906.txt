<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mechanical stimulation in the sea-anemone Calliactis parasitica BY L. M. PASSANO AND C. F. A. PANTIN, F.R.S. Zoological Laboratory, University of Cambridge (Received 5 July 1954) 1. A method of administering measured local mechanical stimuli is described. Experiments were done upon the anemone Calliactis parasitica. 2. Mechanical stimuli show rapid apparent adaptation-partly due to simple mechanical causes such as contracture and passive deformation of the tissues. 3. When conditions are standardized a mechanical stimulus of sufficient intensity on the column gives a nervous impulse. These mechanical stimuli can be used in the same way as electric shocks to give facilitated responses. 4. Increasing the mechanical intensity of the stimulus shows a threshold below which no impulse is generated; and with further increase of strength, trains of increasing numbers of impulses. There exists a system capable of graded mechanical excitation. Gradation is also to be observed below the threshold since there can be summation of subliminal stimuli. 5. The excitable system appears to be orientated tangentially and responds to stretch rather than to pressure. 6. The excitable system is purely endodermal. The ectoderm and mesogloea act only as an integument. 7. On histological grounds there are grave difficulties in supposing that impulses set arise simply and directly in the numerous simple sense organs. The possibility is noted that the graded excitation of the mechanically sensitive system causes the nerve-net to fire off impulses. 8. The sensitivity of different parts of the animal varies greatly. In Calliactis the oral disk is as least 4000 times as sensitive as the column. 9. The combination of a simple mechanically excitable system with the gross morpho- logical features of the bodily organization permits purposive and varied responses. Thus strong stimulation of the column leads to the closure reflex, whilst weak stimulation of the disk by contact or by water movements leads to appropriate responses connected with feeding or rejection. INTRODUCTION The reflex closure of Calliactis parasitica and other actinians has been analyzed fairly completely by electrical stimulation. Nervous impulses are conducted up the through-conduction system of the nerve-network to the responding sphincter and retractor muscles. But in nature it is not electrical stimuli which cause the reflex. Normally, mechanical and other stimuli initiate the nervous impulses (Pantin I935 a). We may therefore ask: how do impulses arise in the nerve-net in response to natural stimuli? The range of stimuli to which actinians are sensitive does not wholly correspond with that for man. The pattern of chemical stimulation is not the same (Pantin &amp; Pantin I943). Again, in Calliactis, we have found that there is a singular in- sensitivity to heat. If a wire that can be electrically heated be inserted down a glass tube on to the surface of the column there is no response to localized heat even when this is sufficient to burn the ectoderm. The power of light and of chemical stimnuli to initiate the closure reflex has not yet been fully investigated. But undoubtedly in nature the reflex is most commonly initiated by mechanical stimuli and it is these that we shall discuss in this paper. [ 226 ]</page><page sequence="2">Mechanical stimulation in the sea-anemone Calliactis parasitica 227 METHODS In the anemones chosen for experiment both the diameter at the foot and the height when expanded were 5 to 6 cm. They were allowed to attach themselves to small marble blocks. The response of the marginal sphincter was recorded kymographically. In nature the closure reflex is usually brought about by gross contact of a foreign body with the anemone. Figure 1 records the responses to the application by hand of a pointed wooden rod to the base of the column near the pedal disk. Application of the stimulus is followed by a contraction which can be seen to be caused by a train of impulses facilitating a response of the marginal sphincter (Pantin 1935 b). FIGURE 1.

Note sphincter contractions recorded, corresponding to arrival of impulses marked above upper line. Below, time scale 10 s. In order to standardize the conditions of stimulation and to make its intensity measurable the following method was used. The mechanical stimulus was applied by means of either a short glass rod with a smooth, flattened or rounded point, or a glass tube with a lightly fused end. The external diameter of the glass rod or tube was usually about 2 mm; it was carried by a stout straw attached to the coil of a small 'moving-coil' type loudspeaker. The apparatus was calibrated as follows. The force was measured by applying the rod of the mechanical stimulator to an isometric lever writing on a lightly smoked drum. The deflexion was measured at various current intensities through the stimulator. The lever was then calibrated by means of known weights. The extent of free movement of the stimulating rod at different current intensities was also measured. The force and extent of movement of the stimulator was found to vary in a generally linear manner with the current applied. The maximal mechanical stimulus applied varied in different sets of experiments, but; it was of the general order of 26 g/mml2. In any one experiment the relative mechanical stimulus was accurately measured in terms of the applied current and is expressed as a per- centage of the maximal current used in that experiment. For convenience the mechanical stimulus will be referred to as a 'prod', and the rod or tube which gives the mechanical stimulus will be called a 'prodder'. Vol. I43.

Pantin For electrical stimuli, condenser shocks or brief rectangular pulses were given by way of a non-polarizable Ag/AgCOl/sea-water cathode in a glass tube, the orifice of which was usually applied near the base of the column. The anode consisted of an Ag/AgCl plate on the opposite side of the dish containing the animal. Electrical pulses were used to trip a rectangular pulse electronic stimulator of conventional design, or alternatively a condenser discharge shock, and the prodder circuit. These pulses were delivered in a predetermined sequence by a turntable switching device consisting of a spring-powered constant-speed flywheel upon which were mounted adjustable arms radiating from its centre.

The turntable switch is accurate to approximately 10 ms throughout the range 0.05 to 10 s. It can be seen (figure 2a) that a simple condenser discharge circuit is also used as the prodder trigger. The characteristics of the circuit were such that contact by the turntable closed a modified 'post-office' type relay for 7 ms, allowing a pre- determined current to flow through the prodder coil during this time. In those experiments where prods of 1 s duration were used, the condenser dis- charge circuit was replaced by a simple locking relay circuit (figure 2b). By using 'post-office' type relays modified to function also as marking relays, for both electrical and mechanical stimulators, a direct kymographic recording of the exact time of the application of each stimulus was achieved. 228</page><page sequence="4">Mechanical stimulation in the sea-anemone Calliactis parasitica MECHANICAL STIMULATION If the stimulating rod is brought in contact with the column of the anemone and mechanical stimuli of sufficient intensity are applied, a reflex contraction is at first easily evoked. But if the position of the rod is maintained unchanged during suc- cessive stimuli, the threshold seems to rise rapidly. This apparent sensory adapta- tion is in fact of complex origin. The continued presence of an object touching the column causes a slow local contracture of the tissue away from contact. Conse- quently, the stimulating rod operates at an increasing mechanical disadvantage as the tissue retreats away from it. Even if the rod is maintained firmly in contact with the tissue the conditions are not improved, for repeated stimuli now produce an increasing pit-like depression as the tissue and underlying mesogloea are slowly deformed by the action of the rod. Consequently, successive stimuli are still not given under constant mechanical conditions. To evade these difficulties it was our standard practice only to lower the rod into contact with the surface of the tissue immediately before a mechanical stimulus was given. Immediately after the stimulus the rod was raised clear of the tissue and the animal was allowed to rest for a standard period of from 2 to 5 min. With these precautions fairly regular results could be obtained. is -'----------------- .-... . X--------------?- ....... I--"7 T-'-$--- ---&amp; L -1 - b a c FIGURE 3.

Mechanical stimuli, lower signal; electrical stimuli, upper signal. Above: time in seconds. As with a brief electric shock, a very brief mechanical prod of sufficient intensity applied to the column of the anemone can initiate a wave of excitation. In both cases, the marginal sphincter of Calliactis fails to respond to a single stimulus. But if a pair of such stimuli are given, separated by a short interval, a facilitated contraction occurs after the second stimulus; the size of the contraction depending on the interval between the stimuli. This is as easily shown with pairs of brief mechanical prods as with electric shocks (figure 3). In order to investigate the consequences of a single mechanical stimulus, this was preceded or succeeded at a short interval by an electric shock just above threshold intensity. In this way, through facilitation, the presence of even a single impulse generated by the mechanical stimulus could be detected. Figure 4 illustrates part of a typical experiment to determine the effect on Calliactis of brief (50 ms) mechanical prods of varying intensity. The animal was 15-2 229</page><page sequence="5">230 L. M. Passano and C. F. A. Pantin 5 to 6 cm in width and in height. A non-polarizable cathode was placed in contact with the column some centimetres away from the prodder, which bore directly upon the pedal region of the column about 1 cm from its edge. Each mechanical stimulus was preceded by an electric shock above threshold value given I s earlier. Consequently, if the mechanical stimulus is sufficient to initiate even a single impulse, there is a facilitated response.

Note constant threshold and increase of discharge with intensity and prolonged discharge at highest intensity =100 (last impulse marked with dot). brief mechanical and brief electrical stimuli. As figure 4 shows, there is a well- defined mechanical threshold, and this remained fairly constant for the 3 h of this experiment. With electrical stimuli, once the threshold is exceeded its intensity may be increased by 10- or 20-fold (Pantin I935a; Pantin &amp; Vianna, Dias 1952a) without initiating more than a single nervous impulse. At great increases of electrical intensity a shock may generate a brief train of several impulses. As figure 4 shows, with mechanical prods intensities rather less than double the threshold still pro- duce only one impulse. But further increase in strength progressively increases the number of impulses generated by the prod. These impulses are numerous just after the stimulus, so that there is a very large facilitated contraction. However, the impulse train is short, though after a strong brief prod an occasional impulse</page><page sequence="6">Mechanical stimulation in the sea-anemone Calliactis parasitica 231 may still be initiated as long as 1 s later (figure 4, strength 100). Though, like an electrical stimulus, a mechanical one of standardized intensity can regularly initiate an impulse at a threshold value, mechanical stimuli of graded intensity clearly set up a graded state of excitation, which finds expression by steps of one or more nervous impulses. Although the same thing may be true of electrical stimulation, it is very much less evident. There is likewise evidence that the initial process in mechanical excitation is graded even at intensities below that required to initiate an impulse. Brief mechanical stimuli which are just subthreshold can show summation, provided they fall within about 1 s of each other.

Note failure of summation at 2 s. Third row: successive pairs of mechanical stimuli near threshold.

The mechanical effect of these prods is seen as artifacts in the record. Each pair of mechanical stimuli was also followed 2 s later by an adequate electrical stimulus, so that even if only one of the pre- ceding mechanical stimuli was successful it would, nevertheless, be detected by the facilitated response to the succeeding electric shock. The size of a facilitated response depends on the time interval between the suc- cessful stimuli which initiate it (cf. electrical stimuli in top line of figure 5). Thus, if the first mechanical stimulus alone were effective the response would be small, because a whole second, or longer, would elapse between it and the electric shock. But if the second stimulus alone were effective the contraction would be large</page><page sequence="7">232 L. M. Passano and C. F. A. Pantin because the electric shock would follow only - s later. The figure shows that at intensities just below the threshold a leading mechanical stimulus of inadequate strength is repeatedly successful when it is applied again after a brief time interval. In the figure, the size of the facilitated contraction to the electrical stimulus shows that it has been facilitated by an impulse successfully set up by the second mechanical stimulus - s before, although the first mechanical stimulus, of the same intensity, was without effect. This summation effect disappears if the interval exceeds about 1 s. arxll~~~~~ b I electric + 1 mechanical (1 s) ----- ' (-- - - 43 .... _ - ! 2(ls) 34 13 - - - - 2 electric FiGunE 6.

Mechanical stimuli, lower signal: (1) and (3) stimulus duration 50 ms; (2) and (4) stimulus duration 1 s, signal shows ceding and successful stimulus, whether electrical or mechanical, seems to raise the threshold for an immediately following mechanical stimulus. A similar effect is seen with successive adequate electrical stimuli and is a consequence of the rise in threshold during the relative refractory period (Pantin 1 93 5 a). This may raise the threshold for mechanical stimuli, at least for a short time. The state of excitation set up by a mechanical stimulus decays rapidly. This is not only true for brief stimuli. Figure 6 a shows the response to maintained mechanical prods of 1 s duration. Impulses are not generated throughout the mechanical prods of 1 s duration. Impulses are not generated throughout the</page><page sequence="8">Mechanical stimulation in the sea-anemone Calliactis parasitica 233 duration of the stimulus. Strong stimuli of this sort cause an impulse at the beginning and the end of the prod. This is quite different from the effect of a maintained electrical current. While it endures, a constant current causes a more or less rhythmic outburst of impulses (Pantin 1935 b). On the contrary, the response to a constant mechanical stimulus superficially recalls that of a rapidly accommo- dating system, such as a medullated nerve, to a constant current-with its 'on' and 'off' impulses. The effect of maintained mechanical stimuli indicates that it is the rate of deformation of the tissue rather than the deformation itself which is responsible for the stimulus. Other more qualitative experiments with mechanical stimuli of different kinds agree with this. As the intensity of prolonged mechanical stimuli is decreased, the 'off' impulse is the first to disappear. Finally the stimulus fails altogether, and it is noticeable that it does so at a higher threshold than for a stimulus of the same intensity acting only for a very brief time.

Note variation of latent period of facilitated response. and prolonged (1 s) stimuli of the same strength. It is the quick prods that are successful. This lowering of threshold for brief stimuli may well be due to summation of the active 'on' and 'off' phases. These experiments show that during a mechanical stimulus the deformation of the tissue sets up a brief state of excitation. This excitation is graded with the intensity of the stimulus. If it reaches a certain value a nervous impulse is generated; and above that value a train of several impulses increasing in number with its strength. Below the threshold there can for a brief period be temporal summation.</page><page sequence="9">234 L. M. Passano and C. F. A. Pantin No wholly satisfactory method was devised for testing for spatial summation of mechanical stimuli. It was, however, found that lateral thrusts by the prodder acting over several millimetres of the surface caused the outburst of a more numerous train of impulses than the vertical prods normally employed in this work. In addition, the fact that prods given with a prodder of about 2 mm diameter were more effective in eliciting a response than were prodders of less than 1 mm diameter, even though the pressure caused by the latter type were obviously much greater, suggests that some degree of spatial summation may normally occur in the initiation of a nervous impulse in the through-conduction system. Apart from its more obviously graded character there are two other ways in which mechanical excitation differs from electrical. First, the latent period is more variable. With strong 'prods' the latent period is no greater than for an electrical stimulus (about 100 ms). But weaker stimuli may show variable and much longer latencies (figure 7), which may reach 500 ms. The second difference is to be found in the greater variation of the threshold. And though this is in part due to mechanical factors already discussed, the whole level of mechanical excitability can undoubtedly change several-fold from day to day, apparently according to the phase of activity of the animal. THE SITE OF MECHANICAL EXCITATION We shall now inquire at what site mechanical excitation takes place. Histo- logical study (Pantin 1952) of actiniarians shows that the through-conduction system of the nerve-net, which operates the closure reflex, is endodermal, and that this connects with a network of processes or axons which arise from the bases of very numerous rod-like cells standing upright in the epithelium and having the appearance of elementary sense organs. Curiously enough, in the column of anemones these sense organs and their basal connexions are entirely endodermal. We have so far found none in the ectoderm of the column (though they are numerous in the ectoderm of the disk). Nor is there as yet any unequivocal evidence for nerve cells in the mesogloea, which could connect with the endodermal system. So far as histological evidence goes at present, the entire sensory-neuro-motor system of the column is endodermal. This inference is fully borne out by experiment. In Calliactis it is an easy matter to shave away the ectoderm and much of the thick mesogloea over a substantial area of the column without adversely affecting the anemone. If the animal is left to itself, the bare patch becomes repaired by invasion over its surface of the sur- rounding ectoderm. In our experiments, areas of one or two square centimetres were in this way bared of ectoderm and of the outer part of the mesogloea. When these bare areas were tested with the mechanical prodder, their mechanical sensitivity was found to be as great and in some cases even greater than that of neighbouring intact body wall still covered with ectoderm (figure 3). It is clear that in the column of an actini- arian the ectoderm and mesogloea act as a mere integument, and that the entire mechanically excitable system is endodermal.</page><page sequence="10">Mechanical stimulation in the sea-anemone Calliactis parasitica 235 Superficially, one might be tempted to identify the rod-like elementary sense organs of the endoderm as the mechanically excitable system. But the identification is by no means a simple matter. Whilst these internally directed endodermal sense organs could very possibly provide a site for chemical excitation from the gastral fluid on their exposed ends, they are quite wrongly orientated to respond to a mechanical stimulus acting from the outside. A system which would be most readily deformed and therefore excited by such a stimulus might be expected to run tangentially in the body wall, rather than radially and centripetally on the opposite side of the wall from the applied stimulus. There are in fact three systems which might conceivably fulfil these conditions in the column body of an anemone: the basal network of the sensory cells (as opposed to the radial rod-like cell body), the nerve-net, or, provided they could in some way excite the nervous system as well as be excited by it, the circular and parietal muscle sheets. There seems no certain way of at present distinguishing between these possibilities. But the general conclusion that the excited system is a tangential one is consistent with /, FIGURE 8. Response to a pair of brief rrechanical stimuli (at I s interval) (upper signals) given by a 'spear' twisted through a small angle in body wall. The stimuli are followed at -1 s by an electric shock (lower signal). The facilitated contractions show that both mechanical stimuli were successful. other observations. If a tongue of the column wall is cut and tension applied to it impulses are generated which cause the closure reflex. Here it is direct tension rather than radial pressure which is the effective stimulus. The same thing is shown in experiments of the following sort. A thin short (10 to 15 mm) spear was thrust through the column wall about 2 cm above the pedal edge. The free end of the haft was moved laterally by the prodder through 2 mm, so that locally the body wall was thereby given a slight twist. Notwithstanding the small angular extent (about 10?) of the twist and the absence of direct pressure, such movements of the spear provided an efficient way of generating impulses for the closure reflex (figure 8). We can specify one other important feature of the mechanically excitable system. The histological evidence shows us a system of sensory cells, nerve cells and muscle. As figure 1 shows, a mechanical stimulus which sets up a powerful reflex contraction only causes half a dozen or fewer nervous impulses. But on histological grounds, it is clear that the area of contact of any prodder or other instrument which causes the reflex must cover hundreds if not thousands of sensory cells (cf. Pantin I952). Are we to suppose that just one of these sense cells happens to be 'on duty' and fires off its 5 or 6 impulses; or to suppose that a mere 5 or 6 of</page><page sequence="11">236 L. . MPassano and C. F. A. Pantin them fire off one apiece at chosen intervals It seems impossible to suppose that these few impulses arise from a few of the sensory cells in this way. On the other hand, we have seen that the initial process of mechanical excitation is a graded one, and recent work on mechanical and other receptors in other animals has shown that graded stimuli cause graded electrical changes in these; which in turn excite nervous impulses at graded frequency in the attached axon (Gray &amp; Sato 1953). Moreover, in the analogous through-conduction system of Scyphomedusae, there is evidence that mechanical and other excitation can act not by directly en- gendering impulses, but by exciting the through-conducting syster itself to under- go repetitive discharge (Pantin &amp; Vianna Dias I952b). We know that a constant electric current applied to the body wall of Calliactis easily sets up repetitive excitation of the through-conduction system, and does so at the characteristic frequencies required for the closure reflex. It would be in agreement with all these observations if the effect of a mechanical stimulus were to excite some transverse excitable system in a graded manner which in turn was able to excite the through-conduction nerve-net to single or repetitive discharge. REGIONAL SENSITIVITY In Calliactis the thickness of the mesogloea varies enormously in different regions. In a moderately expanded animal of 5 cm diameter the mesogloea of the column is about 1 to 1-5 mm thick in the region of the marginal sphincter, de- creasing to about 200, towards the pedal edge. In the disk and tentacles it is much thinner, of the order of 10/. Since in the column the mechanically excitable system appears to be endodermal, we might expect a decrease in mechanical sensitivity as we pass up the column owing to the increasing thickness of the over- lying mesogloea. The truth of this is a matter of common experience when working with these animals. Table 1 gives the pressure thresholds for mechanical prods in an experiment on an animal about 5 cm high. The units are arbitrary but corre- spond approximately to g/mm2. TABLE 1 near marginal sphincter 26 mid column 15 and later 18 ; down column 13 near pedal edge 12 The tentacles and oral disk are very much more sensitive than the column. The very thin mesogloea renders the tissue much more easily deformed by small forces, and moreover, in this region the most important neuromuscular system is ecto- dermal; the radial muscle sheets of the tentacles being responsible for most of the active movements. A phenomenon accidentally observed enabled an estimate to be made of the mechanical sensitivity of the tentacular disk relative to the column. It was frequently observed that with mechanical stimuli applied to the mid-region of the column, a slight slow contraction of the disk and waving of the tentacles would</page><page sequence="12">Mechanical stimulation in the sea-anemone Calliactis parasitica 237 occur even on a single stimulus and sometimes even below threshold for a facili- tated response of the sphincter. This effect was not seen with electrical stimuli. Observations showed that this was due to a direct excitation of the sensitive tentacular disk by the mechanical stimulus distantly applied on the column. The high sensitivity of the tentacles of many species of anemones, including Calliactis, to pressure waves is easily seen; a light tap on the walls of the aquarium can produce just such a tentacular twitch. In the experiments on Calliactis excitation of the tentacular disk by pressure waves was easily reproduced by attaching a glass coverslip across the end of the mechanical prodder and placing this some 2 cm away from the disk. Sudden move- ment of the prodder caused the characteristic response. Moreover, if the prodder were placed over one edge of the disk only, the response was then confined to that part immediately below it: it was in fact a direct response which did not affect the whole animal by way of the through-conduction system. When the prodder is placed in contact with the column, the area subjected to stress is about 3 mm.2 The force of its sudden impact is transmitted to the fluid filling the cylindrical body cavity of the animal, and since the surface area of this for an animal 5 cm high is about 12000 mm2 (not including the surface of the individual tentacles) the rise in pressure exerted over the general surface may be expected to be not more than 1/4000 of that beneath the prodder. Since the threshold for the disk effect is about the same or slightly less than that for the initiation of an impulse from the wall of the column, it follows that the disk and tentacles cannot be less than 4000 times as sensitive to a mechanical stimulus as the body wall. Functionally, the mechanically excitable system is used for very different purposes in the column and in the disk. In the column the connexion at all points with the through-conduction system which leads to the marginal sphincter makes the whole of this part of the body of the animal comparable to a single gigantic pressure receptor, activation of which causes a protective response. Deformation of any part of the columnar body wall against the enclosed gastral fluid gives rise to nervous impulses in the same system. Mechanically this may be compared with the functional organization, on a far smaller scale, of a single vertebrate pacinian corpuscle, with its tangentially arranged spherical network of nerve endings (Weddell, Pallie &amp; Palmer I954). In the disk, the function of mechanical excitation is different. Here it is primarily concerned with feeding and rejection reactions (Pantin &amp; Pantin x943). The ecto- dermal situation of the effective part of the neuromuscular system and the very great sensitivity conferred by the extreme thinness of the mesogloea and flexibility of the tissues gives a system readily responsive to very slight mechanical stimuli. Moreover, owing to the absence of through-conduction here, the localized con- traction to a stimulus applied to the disk and tentacles enables an appropriate local response to be made by a tentacle or a part of the disk. Not only this, the tympanum-like arrangement of the thin disk upon a stout cylindrical column and the thin hollow tentacles provides a natural machine for the detection of pressure waves in the water set up by the movement of an object</page><page sequence="13">238 L. M. Passano and C. F. A. Pantin near but not yet in contact with the anemone. We have already seen an experiment which illustrates this in Calliactus, and it is very readily observed in many other anemones. This is particularly clear in Anemonia sulcata, in which vibration or water movement near the animal promptly causes waving movements of the long tentacles in the surrounding water. The anthropomorphic impression that these movements give when food or other objects are allowed to fall near the animal is that 'the animal is seeking contact with an object which it has blindly perceived'. The machinery of this apparently highly purposive activity seems to be mechani- cally simple. And it is certainly of advantage to the animal-for natural observa- tion at once shows that it increases the likelihood of contact with prey. What is particularly interesting is that these varied purposive reactions are effected not through highly specialized sense organs, but through the combined use of a comparatively undifferentiated mechanically excitable system with the gross morphological organization of the body as a whole; the thick column wall, and the system of disk and tentacles.
