<plain_text><page sequence="1">David ben Yehudah Hehasid and his Book of Mirrors DANIEL CHANAN MATT The Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California R. David ben Yehudah Hehasid was a Spanish Kabbaiist of the 13th-14th centuries. Little is known about his life. His SeferMarmot Hazove'ot is a composite work: an anthology of Kabbalah and an original commentary on the Torah. R. David copies freely, and almost always without acknowledgment, from several prominent Kabbalists of the 13th century: Ezra and Azriel of Gerona, Todros Abulafia, Mosheh de Leon and Yosef Gikatilla. An important feature of the Book of Mirrors is the large number of passages from the Zohar which R. David translates into Hebrew from the original pseudo-Aramaic. His renderings represent the first lengthy translations of the Zohar. Through them we see how a contemporary Kabbaiist read and under stood (and sometimes misunderstood) the seminal work of Kabbalah. R. David's attitude toward the Zohar can be gauged. He did not regard it as an ancient midrash. In fact, he appropriates the literary format of the Zohar (the mystical circle of Shim'on bar Yoljai and the Havrayya) in order to introduce his own teachings. The Zohar thus becomes a model and a springboard for creative mystical exegesis. R. David's contributions to Kabbalistic thought cannot be fully evaluated until his other works have been edited from manuscript and studied. However, based on an analysis of the Book of Mirrors (a critical edition has been published by this author; see note 1), it is clear that R. David's reflections are at times enlightening. The second half of this article discusses his original formulations in the context of 13th century Kabbalah. These include: the relation of the mystic to the Infinite; the doctrine of cEser Zahzahot, ten translucent lights which precede the emanation of the Sephirot; and the independent quality of Shekhinah, who is described as Sod Ha'efshar, the Secret of the Possible. I Very little is known about the life of Rabbi David ben Yehudah Hehasid. He was a Spanish Kabbalist who lived during the second half of the 13th and the first half of the 14th centuries. He travelled widely, by medieval standards, spending time in France and Germany. In his Sefer Mar30tMar30t Hazove3otHazove3ot he states that he carried a certain holy name "on all the roads I travelled," and that "due to the tribulations of travel, I lost it."1 (1) David ben Yehudah Hehasid, Sefer Mar'ot Hazove'ot, ed.

Mosheh ben Nahman, the Ramban, whose son, Yehudah, served as a courtier in Castile.2 However, the two passages ascribed to R. David which bear witness to such a relationship have recently been proven forgeries,3 and so the question must remain open. More significant than his genealogy is R. David's relationship to the Zohar. Over fifty years ago, Scholem noted that R. David was the first author after R. Mosheh de Leon to rely heavily upon the Zohar.4 R. David's Sefer Hagevul is a translation and elaboration of most of the 3Idra RabbaRabba (Zohar III, 127b-145a).5 His °0r Zaruca, a Kabbalistic Commentary on the Prayers, makes abundant use of the Zohar without referring to it directly.® In between these two projects, R. David composed Sefer Marmot Hazove^ot,Hazove^ot, a voluminous Commentary on the Torah. This book is at once an anthology of 13th Century Kabbalah and an original Kabbalistic work. Written towards the end of the 13 th or the beginning of the 14th century,7 Sefer Marmot Hazove°ot translates many passages from the Zohar from the (2)(2) See Reuven Margaliot, Vikkuah Haramban (Lvov, 1989), p. 48: cf.

The treatise is attributed to R. David on fol. 32r. After a few pages of these secrets, the MS reads: "The awareness of this generation is limited; they cannot comprehend in depth nor are they worthy to. If this were not the case, I would transmit more of the profound, sealed mysteries and the marvelous wonders from the secrets of He-who-dwells-in-the-heights, from what I have received from my grandfather, the Great Rabbi, our Master, Mosheh son of Nahman, may his memory be a blessing" (fols. 33v-34r). At the end of the manuscript, the genealogy is described more explicitly: "From the son of Nahman, Mosheh the Prince, I have received it; I have gathered it from his vineyard. I am David; he is my grandfather . . . the father of Rabbi Yehudah Hasid" (fol. 36V). Efraim Kupfer, of the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts at the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem, has discovered that the real author of the Sodot Sodot was not R. David, but R. Yom Tov Lipmann Muelhausen, the 15th century Rabbi and Kabbalist, author of Sefer Nizahon. In all the other extant versions of the Sodot, neither the two autobiographical passages nor the attribution of the work to R. David are to be found. Apparently, a certain scribe chose to attribute R. Yom Tov's work to R. David ben Yehudah Hehasid and, therefore, inserted references to R. David's supposed genealogy. Kupfer has not yet published this discovery; he informed me of it in Jerusalem, in April 1977. For a full discussion see Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 3-5. (4) Scholem, "Mikhtav le-H. N.

David never mentions his source. At times he adds his own comments and explanations to the translations, and we thus see how a contemporary Kabbalist read and understood (and sometimes misunderstood!) the Zohar. In addition to his translations, R. David includes material from other prominent works of 13th century Spanish Kabbalah. He copies freely, and almost always without acknow ledgment, from cEzra ben Shelomoh, cAzriel ben Menahem, Todros Abulafia and Yosef Gikatilla.8 The charge of plagiarism is not relevant here. As has been pointed out, it was a common practice among medieval authors to borrow freely from other writers without mentioning the source.9 R. David's reliance on others in composing Sefer Marmot Haiove^ot does not prevent him from exercising his own creative imagination. His mystical interpretations and formulations constitute the bulk of the book and are, at times, strikingly original. It appears that R. David needed the example and support of his Kabbalistic predecessors and older contemporaries before he could set out on his own. Even then he was hesitant to claim authorship and, as we shall see, sometimes chose to imitate the pseudepigraphic style of the Zohar. Only gradually did he espouse his own teachings. Sefer Sefer Marmot Hazove^ot offers a panoply of literary styles. As R. David switches roles, from translator to editor to pseudonym to Kabbalist, the sensitive reader encounters different facets of Spanish Kabbalah. He comes to see that this is indeed a Book of Mirrors, reflecting razin de^oraita, secret rays of the light of Torah. II Of the five extant manuscripts of Sefer Marmot Hazove^ot (SMhZ), Escorial MS G-I-15 offers the best version of the text.10 This copy of SMhZ was completed in 1468 in Tlemcen, Algeria, and, according to the colophon, was written for R. Natan Sholal (1437-1502), one of the leading rabbis of North African Jewry.11 The manuscript remained in R. Sholal's family for several generations. It was inherited first by his relative R. Yizhaq Sholal and, following R. Yizhaq's death, passed into the possession of 3Avraham Sholal, Yizhaq's orphaned son. It was purchased from 'Avraham's guar (7) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 13-14.

David ibn Zimra, the famous Kabbalist and teacher of Yizhaq Luria.12 Although the Escorial MS can claim an impressive line of owners and readers, it shares with all the other extant copies of SMhZ a peculiar feature. It begins in the middle of the Torah, at ParashatנAharei Mot.3י The obvious question is: Was SMhZ originally longer, covering the entire Torah? The internal evidence is inconclusive. There are several indications that that SMhZ was originally more extensive, but there are also certain struc tural details which suggest that the Commentary was never intended to cover more ground than it does.14 However, there is clear external evidence that SMhZ was once more complete. First of all, there exist three later quotations of Zohar transía tions from SMhZ that do not appear in our text. Two of these are found in Me^r ibn Gabbai's cAvodat Haqodesh (1568).15 The other is recorded both by Hayyim Vital and by his son, Shemu3el.16 They learned of the passage from Yizhaq Luria who copied out a Zohar translation from SMhZ onto the margin of his own copy of the Zohar.17 None of these three Zohar translations are to be found in the extant manuscripts of SMhZ. Further evidence comes from an anonymous collection of Kabbalistic teachings contained in Sassoon MS 596.18 As one of his selections, the author-editor copies eight pages of a Kabbalistic Commentary on Parashat TerumahTerumah without naming the original author. By examining this passage closely and comparing it with the extant version of SMhZ, the reader is brought to the conclusion that the Commentary on Parashat Terumah is actually a remnant of the complete original text of SMhZ.19 The parallels (1 2) See Ibn Zimra's note, included in the critical apparatus to SMhZ, 273,16. Ibn Zimra quotes quotes extensively from SMh% in his AÍ igdal David; see Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 10-11, 40. Luria himself consulted SMh£ when studying Zohar, as we learn from a statement by Shemu3el Vital, Shacar Ma'amarei Rashbi (Tel Aviv, 1961), p. 150; cf. Scholem, "Ketavav Ha'amitiyim shel Ha'ari Bekabbalah," Kiryat Sefer 1g (1942-43): 183. (13) The Jerusalem MS begins even later, at Parashat Beha'alotekha.

It could be hypothesized that R. David actually composed SMhZ in two halves, the present text repre senting the second half, a unit in itself. However, since we have hardly any knowledge of the first part of the Commentary, such a conclusion is at present premature, and we should content ourselves with the determina tion that SMhZ was originally longer, probably extending over the entire Torah. The title of R. David's work, Sefer Marmot Hazove^ot, is based on Exodus 38:8: ויעש את הכיור נחשת ואת כנו נחשת במראת הצבאת אשר צבאו פתח אהל מועד. "He made the laver of copper and its stand of copper, from the mirrors of the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting."21 There is a rich midrashic tradition connected with this verse,22 of which R. David was certainly aware.23 However, the significance of the title is not to be found within the realm of Midrash. Rather, we must trace the use of this phrase in later medieval literature, primarily in Kabbalah, in order to discover its importance for R. David. A first clue is found in Shelomoh ibn Gabirol's poem, Keter Malkhut, written around the middle of the 11th century. Describing the state of bliss which souls may experience in the world-to-come, Gabirol writes: ושם מעמדות ומראות לנפשות העומדות במראות הצובאות את פני האדון לראות ולהראות.24 The marmot hazove'ot enable these high souls to see and be seen by God Himself. They are mirrors reflecting visions of the soul and God back and forth to each other. Of course the word mar3ah means both mirror and vision.25 The poetic usage suggests the image ofנaspaqlarya hameHrah (the shining mirror), employed in the Talmud and Midrash in connection (20)(2o) See Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 94-95, n. 97. The passage from the Sassoon MS has been appended to SMhZ, pp. 274-282. (21) The ToroA, JPS Translation (Philadelphia, 1962), p. 170. On the words "the women who performed tasks," there is a footnote: "Meaning of Hebrew uncertain." Cf. I Samuel 2:22. (22) See especially the passage in Tanhuma, Pequdei, Par. 9. For a full array of the different midrashim consult Menahem Kasher,Humash Torah Shelemah, Vol. 23 (Jerusalem, 1969), pp. 50-52. Cf. also Ramban's Commentary on this verse, and Zohar II 4a.

The Sefirot themselves gaze into a higher source of light — the shining mirror of God's splendor. Thus, by the 13 th century the phrase marmot hazove^ot was associated with spiritual bliss and prophetic vision. As the Kabbalah developed over the next fifty to sixty years, "the mirrors of those who served at the Tent of Meeting" became symbols of stages of life within God Himself. The entire Tabernacle was envisaged as an earthly representation of the World of the Sefirot,28 and within this scheme, the marmot hazove^ot occupied a specific place. The sefirotic symbolism of these mirrors is described in the works of two contemporaries of R. David, Yosef ben Shalom Ashkenazi and Yosef Gikatilla. Both of these Kabbalists had a strong influence on the author.29 Yosef ben Shalom, in his Commentary on Sefer Yezirah, speaks of Malkhut as containing all of the marmot hazove^ot: כי בה יראו כל המראות הצובאות וכל 30.האספקלריאות וכל הנמצאות כדרך שנראים הצורות באספקלריא Malkhut is a cosmic mirror reflecting all of the higher Sefirot, the forms of all being. Because She contains them all and displays them, She herself is called marmot hazove°ot.31 hazove°ot.31 According to Yosef Gikatilla, mar'ot hazove^ot refers to the two Sefirot (26) B. T.

These mirror Sefirot are the source of vision for all prophets except Moses, who was able to connect directly with the higher Sefirah, Tiferet, "the shining mirror."32 R. David draws on both these formulations in SMhZ. On the one hand, he often speaks of Malkhut as containing within Herself all of the upper lights and colors and mirrors, e.g.: שהיא כנסת ישראל שהכל נראים בה כי כל 33.המדרגות והאספקלריאות והמראות כלם נראים בה The phrasing dovetails with that of Yosef ben Shalom. On the other hand, R. David copies Gikatilla in referring to Nezah and Hod as maHot hazove°ot.34 In R. David's circle, this biblical phrase had acquired a range of mean ing extending through the realms of prophecy and sefirotic symbolism. The two words themselves — mar°ot hazove3ot — seem to have become a prism, reflecting a variety of nuances and interpretations. In calling his work Sefer Marmot Hazove^ot, R. David may have intended to say that he, too, had gazed into the mirrors and wished to record his own reflections.35 Ill SMhZ SMhZ is presented as a Commentary on the Torah. To the unsuspecting reader, the book appears as a unified whole. However, upon closer analysis, we find that there are actually many different ingredients which have been skillfully combined by the author. These different components can be classified into three groups: 1) selections from the Midrash; 2) R. David's Kabbalistic teachings; 3) teachings of other 13th century Spanish Kabbalists, including the Zohar. These three strands are woven together and form a series of complicated patterns. It is often difficult to unravel and identify the individual threads. R. David rarely identifies his sources, and sometimes disguises teachings by placing them in the mouth of a (32) Gikatilla, Sha'arei יOrah, pp. 65-66; 70-72. Cf. Bahya ben 3Asher, Commentary on the TorahTorah to Num. 12:6; Mosheh de Leon, SheqelHaqodesh, ed. A. W. Greenup (London, 1911), p. 58; idem, Shushan cEdut, ed.

David borrows from Gikatilla and not vice-versa; see below, Sec. III. In the "Sefer Ta'ame Hamizvot" by Yosef of Hamadan, ed. M. Meier (Ph.D. diss., Brandéis University, 1974), p. ígg.AezaAand/fod are identified with Aaron's two sons, Nadav and 'Avihu, who were killed. This interpretation is offered as the "heavenly" Kab balistic meaning of the first verse of Parashat3Aharei Mot; cf. Alexander Altmann, "Lishe'elat Ba'aluto shel S. Ta'amei Hamizvot," Kiryat Sefer 40 (1965): 269. R. David draws from this work several times; see Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 106, n. 190. Did this interpretation influence his choice of where to begin the second half of SMhZ ? (35) Isaac Broydé, in his article on R. David in theJewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 4 (New York, 1903), pp. 464-65, translates the title as "Visions of the Assembled." Though not the primary sense, this does provide food for thought; see below, n. 126.</page><page sequence="8">136 DANIEL CHANAN MATT [8] Talmudic rabbi, his favorite being R. Hiyya.36 This is a clear imitation of Zoharic style. The division into parashiyyot is, of course, essential for a Commentary on the Torah. Yet, at times in SMhZ, this division is imposed on the material rather than providing a natural framework for the Commentary. For example, the beginning of Parashat Behacalotekha interrupts a long selection from a work by Todros Abulafia, which begins in the preceding parashahparashah and then resumes following the interruption!37 Similarly, the title of Parashat Re^eh serves only to break the sequence between two selections from Yosef Gikatilla.38 Apparently, R. David wanted to include a certain amount of material and felt free to simply divide it up among different parashiyyot. On the other hand, R. David's own teachings are almost always based on specific verses or midrashic selections pertaining to each parashah. Here, the traditional divisions of the Torah provide an organic framework for Kabbalistic exegesis. Turning first to the Kabbalistic sources in his "anthology," we note that R. David copies from the works of at least five well-known Kabbalists of the 13th century: cEzra ben Shelomoh and cAzriel ben Menahem of Gerona, Todros ben Yosef Abulafia, Mosheh de Leon and Yosef Gikatilla. He does not identify his sources, though once, in quoting from R. cAzriel, he begins: 39.וראיתי אני בפי' (בפירוש) קצת מן המקובלים The Talmudic figures R. Hiyya and R.

The selections cover more than sixteen pages of SMhZ, including the entire Parashat Mascei.Mascei. At times, R. David is careless and forgets to delete phrases such as כמו שביארנו or 47.כמו שפירשנו In Gikatilla's work these phrases refer to earlier chapters, but they are quite out of place in SMhZ\ Usually, though, R. David is careful to remove these telltale expressions. On the other hand, there are instances where R.

Several pages later, he interrupts Abulafia's words with the beginning of Parashat Be hacalotekha.hacalotekha. There now follow two pages of Midrash and Zohar translation corresponding to this Parashah (SMhZ, 156,29 — 158,16), after which Abulafia's text resumes.

David's anthology is the Zohar. Writing soon after the composition of this brilliant work,51 R. David translates numerous Zohar passages from the original pseudo-Aramaic into Hebrew. His renderings represent the first lengthy translations of the Zohar ever produced.52 One can learn from them certain details about the original text of the Zohar. One sees how a Spanish Kabbalist read and understood the work and what difficulties he had with its peculiar syntax and language. One discovers, too, what it was about this book that so fascinated R. David. In offering his Zohar translations, R. David never mentions his source. He simply presents the material as part of SMhZ. Generally, the Zohar passages are selected from the parashah in the Zohar corresponding to the parashahparashah in R. David's Commentary. In fact the first fourteen pages of SMhZ are one long series of Zohar translations all taken from Parashat (51) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 13-14.

In a number of cases, the translations offer a different Zohar reading, not found in any of the printed editions.56 In a few instances, they preserve Zohar readings superior to the printed text.57 Often the translations help the reader decide whether to substitute, delete, or add a variant reading found in our editions.58 Not surprisingly, a number of times they support earliest layer of theZohar (see Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 181-186).

David is generally loyal to the text of the Zohar. However, he does introduce certain changes. At times, he leaves out names or adds them.61 He also removes certain narrative sections and discussions between different rabbis.62 Formulae such as כדקאמרן, והא אוקימנא כמה דאוקימנא, are often deleted,63 though R. David occasionally adds phrases such as והבן זה or 64.ודי בזה לכל מבין The translator apparently sought to simplify the Zohar's style, remove it from the realm of mystical novel and integrate it into his Commentary. R. David is an interpreter and not merely a translator. He adds his own comments and explanations to the Zohar passages. Sometimes these con sist of spelling out the sefirotic allusions of the Zohar.65 In other instances, he clarifies an expression or fills in the context by adding a few words.66 R. David exhibits greater independence when he elaborates on the Zohar, developing his own ideas and formulations.67 The Zohar has awakened his creative instinct and he, too, begins to expound on the mysteries. R. David's translations are of good quality. Given the difficult syntax of the pseudo-Aramaic, they are, in fact, remarkably clear and accurate.68 Still,Still, the translator ran across some difficulties and, in a number of cases, misunderstood the Zohar's language.

R. David picks the wrong translation in several cases.75 The verbs 78כנש 77,שרי,76,נטל are occasionally mistranslated, and the verb בעי, which means both "want to" and "have to," is at times misunderstood.79 In one case, a mistranslation of בעי leads to an interesting theological formulation. In the Talmud (B.T. Sanhedrin 38b), there is the following midrash recounted by Rav: בשעה שבקש הקב''ה לבראות את האדם ברא כת אחת 80.של מלאכי השרת. אמר להם רצונכם נעשה אדם בצלמנו ... The story goes on to tell of the opposition of the angels to the creation of Man. The Zohar (III 207b) paraphrases the midrash: בשעתא דסליק בדעותיה דקב"ה למברי אנשא קרא לכתות כתות דמלאכי עלאה ואותיב לון קמיה. אמר לון בעינא למברי אדם .... R. David translates this passage from the Zohar (SMhZ, 216,5 ff.), but his rendering is quite original: בשעה שעלה ברצונו של הב"ה לבראות בן אדם קרא (Jerusalem, 1971), p. 56. In his Sefer Hagevul, R. David also omits certain roots and words which he did not understand; see Goldreich, ShG, pp. 69-72. (70) SMhZ 12,20 (אסקופה, cf. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 165; p. 388, n. 47); SMhZ, 216,1 (צחותא, cf. Major Trends, p. 389, n. 49).

Scholem,Major Trends, p. 388, n. 36; Kaddari,Diqduq, p. 66. In one case R. David translates it correctly: SMhZ, 109,20. (74) In SMhZ, 10,28, the Zohar's expression זעירץ אינון דזכאין (III 68b) is translated: מעטים הם הצדיקים. The correct rendering is: מעטים הם שזוכים. (75) In SMhZ, ■94. 20, the Zohar's phrase אנשי שם אינון (III 176b) is translated: אנשי שם אותם, whereas the correct translation is: אנשי שם הם. Cf. Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 103, n. 166. (76) נטל is mistakenly rendered as נסע instead of לקח several times: SMhZ, 92, 8, id, 11: 184, 8. Once it is left untranslated when in fact it should be rendered as וכשנוסל הרוח אזי :נסע נוטל הנפש (SMhZ, 109. 20, corresponding to Zohar I, 206a). (77) In SMhZ, 4.23, the Zohar's phrase נד שראו בארעא is translated: כשהם מתחילים כארץ. The correct translation is כשהיו שורים בארץ. The author has confused two different meanings of the root שרי.

God's desire to create Man has here been translated into God's need for Man! This accords well with the Kabbalistic idea of 81,צורך גבוה though Mosheh de Leon most probably had in mind the more traditional formulation.82 We see here the delicacy and the power of words, along with the freedom and responsibility of the translator. The Zohar translations produced by R. David show us how a contem porary Kabbalist read and understood (and at times misunderstood) this classical mystical text. Moreover, they reveal something of the translator's attitude toward the Zohar. R. David is obviously impressed by the Book of Splendor Splendor and captivated by its style. However, it seems that he does not hold the view that the Zohar dates back to R. ShinTon bar Yohai. Of course, he usually presents the teachings in their original form, in the names of the Havrayya. But, as we have seen, he feels free to delete passages, to add his own pseudonyms, interpretations and comments, and even to insert long elaborations directly into the text.83 Furthermore, he employs R. Shimcon's name to introduce non-Zoharic material which he knew was written in the 13th century.84 Such an independent style of translation and editing would be unthinkable for a man who believed in the ancient authorship of the Zohar. The Zohar is important for R. David not because it represents the doctrines of R. Shimcon bar Yohai and his colleagues but, rather, because it offers him a model for mystical exegesis of the Torah. This will come into sharper focus as we turn now to R. David's own appearance in his Book of of Mirrors. V In his own parts of the Commentary, R. David is still influenced, naturally, by older sources, both Rabbinic and Kabbalistic. He brings material from both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, the Pesiqtot, Sifrei, Bereshit Rabba,Rabba, Vayiqra Rabba, Bemidbar Rabba, Kohelet Rabba and, especially, th3' Tanhuma.85 He refers explicitly to Midrash Tehillim, Tanhuma, Bereshit (81) For a discussion of this idea, see Gottlieb, "Hayesod Hatei'ologi Vehamisti shel Tefisat Yi'ud Ha'adam Bakabbalah," Mehqarim Besifrut Hakabbalah (Tel Aviv, 1976), pp. «9-37• (82) The Zohar passage is clearly based on the midrash; note the first line of the Zohar (and the translation as well). R. David conforms to the more sober interpretation in SMhZ, 14, 5, 9 (translating from the Zohar); and 42,20 (quoting the Tanhuma). (83) See above, nn. 61, 62, 66, 67. Cf.

Chief among them are the Zohar88 and R. Yosef ben Shalom Ashkenazi, a contemporary of the author.89 R. David also draws from Sefer Habahir, Isaac the Blind, cAzriel of Gerona, Sefer Hatemunah, the Ramban, Mosheh de Leon's Hebrew writings and Yosef of Hamadan.90 R. David's first independent piece of commentary appears after more than thirteen pages of Zohar translations.91 Several features here are characteristic of his teachings in SMhZ. First of all, there is a clear imitation of the Zohar's style. Not only are the Havrayya mentioned near the begin ning of the passage (SMhZ, 14,28), but the whole discourse is attributed to R. Hiyya, a Talmudic sage who appears frequently in the Zohar.92 It is no accident that the author places this teaching in the mouth of R. Hiyya. This figure is destined to become, over the next two hundred and fifty pages, R. David's favorite pseudonym.93 In fact, R. David is so eager to have his alter ego accepted into the circle of the Havrayya that he con eludes the passage with words of praise from none other than R. Shimcon bar Yohai, the "Holy Light"94 of the Zohar: "R. Shimcon said to R. Hiyya, 'You are worthy and everything you have spoken is fine. The Ancient of-Days95 will watch over you.'96!" One could hardly ask for clearer proof that R. David is appropriating the literary format of the Zohar. He has been so impressed by this work (86) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 105, nn. 177-180. (87) Ibid.., n. 181. (88) See ibid., n. 182, for a list of passages with Zohar parallels. In several of these passages, R. David introduces his teachings with the words:... וזהר סוד, or. .. והסוד בזה. This is a good indication of his source. (89) Ibid., n. 183. Scholem feels that David and Yosef were acquaintances; see "Peraqim," pp. 294-95- 3•3- 3«°■ 322-24• (90) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 105-6, nn. 184-190. (91) SMhZ, 14,26-18,8. (92) E.g.

He also attaches it to a Zohar translation, several TanhumaTanhuma passages and a long quotation from R. cAzriel. R. David uses other figures, as well, to introduce his own teachings; R. Shimcon (SMhZ, 93,2); R. 3EPazar (56,19; 86,5). (94) The term Rozina Qadisha is applied by the Zohar to R. ShinTon, e.g. I 197b; III 7b,296b.

Now, sanctioned by the Master himself, R. David dives into the depths of Kabbalistic interpretation. He comes back to the surface often, however, to start the process all over again. Over the next hundred pages, SMhZ alternates between translations of the Zohar and R. David's own teach ings. The author cannot or does not want to leave his source. Apparently, he still needs the support and example of "R. Shimcon."97 Returning to R. Hiyya's opening discourse, we note another feature which typifies R. David's method. The verse which R. Hiyya expounds (Eccles. 9:2) seems to have appeared out of the blue. It is not quoted in any of the preceding Zohar translations, nor is it found (needless to say) in the parashahparashah corresponding to this section of SMhZ, "Aharei Mot. From where did R. David choose it? Midrash Tanhuma. The first paragraph of the TanhumaTanhuma to Parashat "Aharei Mot begins with this verse, though R. Hiyya's name is not to be found there. R. David, then, begins this section of his Commentary by imitating the Zohar and the Tanhuma at the same time. Throughout Throughout SMhZ, R. David turns back to the Tanhuma again and again, sometimes for isolated verses but more often for whole passages of mid rash.98 He then proceeds to build his commentaries on these verses and passages.99 Usually, though not always, he quotes from the section of the Tanhuma Tanhuma corresponding to the parashah he is interpreting.100 Often, he distinguishes his mystical interpretations from the Tanhuma by introduc ing them with the phrase 101,אבל סוד הדבר or with his favorite expression 102.ואתה צריך לדעת At other times, R. David tries to make it appear as if his (97) Gradually, R. David exhibits a more independent attitude. In SMhZ, 90,25, after translating Zohar for three pages, he begins his own teaching with the words: אבל באתי לוזודיען־. In another passage on 119,5 ff., which leads up to a translation from the Midrash Hanezelam, he alludes to three of his own works, and refers to them obliquely as נעלמים (line 10). Is R. David trying to equate his work with the Zohar? Later Kabbalists were convinced that R. David's creations were part of the Midrash Hanezelam\ David ibn Zimra, in his Migdal David (Lemberg, 1883), p. 23c, after quoting SMhZ, 112,23 — 113,12, writes: עכ''ל מראות הצובאות ונראה שהוא מו המדרש הנעלם. Avraham 'Adrutiel also adopts this view. It seems that R. David succeeded all too well in hiding his identity behind Talmudic pseudonyms and 13th century Kabbalists. Although his Book of Mirrors was studied and cited by many prominent Jewish mystics, including Mecir ibn Gabbai, David ibn Zimra, Shelomoh Alkabez, Mosheh Cordo vero and Yizhaq Luria, none of them mention R. David as the author; see Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 39-41. (98) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 107, nn. 198-199. (99) Sometimes, R. David simply copies out a selection from the Tanhuma without adding a mystical interpretation. Then he proceeds to interpret verses from the Parashah itself; see ibid., n. 200. (100) For exceptions to this norm, see ibid., p. 108, n. 201. (101) Ibid., n. 202. Cf. the Zoharic expression: רזא דמלה. (102) Ibid., n. 203.</page><page sequence="18">146 DANIEL CHAN AN MATT [ 18] interpretations are part of the Tanhuma itself.103 The Zohar, too, often adopts this latter approach in dealing with midrashic material.104 In copying selections from the Tanhuma, R. David, at times, introduces small changes. Some of these are very revealing. At one point, the phrase שנו רבותינו is converted to 105.אמרו החבריא In another passage, the Tanhuma recounts a conversation between God and the People of Israel, identified as as Keneset Yisra^el. In the Rabbinic text, one line of God's speech to Israel is introduced by the words אמר להם. R. David writes here 106.אמר לה Being a true Kabbalist, he takes Keneset Yisra^el to mean the Shekhinah and not simply the earthly Community of Israel.107 Finally, in another passage, the Tanhuma reads: אמי הקב''ה לישראל כל זמן שאתם מדובקים במצות אתם חיים שנא' ואתם הדבקים ביי אלהיכם חיים כלבם היום. R. David renders God's statement differently: 108.כל זמן שאתם מדובקים בי The mystic in R. David has triumphed over the copyist! As SMhZ proceeds, R. David gradually relies less on the Tanhuma, and simply comments directly on verses from the parashiyyot of the Torah.109 At times, he takes a verse and connects each word in it to a particular Sefirah.110 He is especially attracted to personal names and often inter prets these sefirotically.111 At one point, he makes a general principle out of this approach and offers this view of mystical exegesis: All the names in the entire Torah refer to a supernal secret. There fore, if all the oceans were ink, and every person a scribe, and heaven and earth sheets of parchment, they still would not be able to write (103) Ibid., n. 204. (104) Cf. almost any page of the Zohar in Margaliot's edition with his Nizoze Zohar for Rabbinic parallels. (105) SMhZ, 79,3. (106) Ibid., 112,19. 1י &gt;s possible that R. David's Tanhuma read here: אמר לה. (107) For a fascinating study on the evolution of the concept of Shekhinah, see Scholem, "Schechina; das passiv-weibliche Moment in der Gottheit," Von der mystischen Gestalt der GottheitGottheit (Frankfurt am Main, 1973), pp. 135-191; Hebrew translation by Yosef Ben Shlomo in Scholem, Pirqe Yesod Behavanat Hakabbalah Usemaleha (Jerusalem, 1976), pp. 259-307• (108) SMhZ, 51, 18. It is possible that R. David possessed a MS of the Tanhuma which read: מדובקים בי. This is unlikely, however; cp. the famous Talmudic statements in B.T. KetubotKetubot 111b and Sotah 14a which ask rhetorically: וכי אפשר לדבוקי בשכינהז and וני אפשר לו לאדם להלך אחר השכינה?. One cannot really cleave to God's Presence or walk directly behind Him. Rather, one should engage in good deeds and thus imitate God. Yosef Gikatilla is not satisfied with this response and in Shacarei נOrah (p. 166) he writes: ומ"ש רז''ל וכי אפשר לאדם להדבק בשכינה אפשר ואפשר! R. David apparently shares this view. (109) This transition is quite apparent in Parashat 'Emor. (110) Matt, SMhZ, p. 109, n. 211.

David, the Torah is an unlimited source of mystical Truth. Each word reflects countless rays of light to the Kabbalistic eye of his mind. He does not hesitate to give different interpretations to the same word, identifying it first with one Sefirah, then with another.113 It seems as if the wellsprings of the Torah have just opened up for him, thanks, in part, to the example of the Zohar. Now he, too, is eager to share in the enterprise and publish his own discoveries. The reader senses a tone of urgency in SMhZ.114 There is new knowledge in the land,115 and R. David is one of those who feels impelled to reveal at least some of the secrets.116 He writes, "But I will lead you into the depth of this secret . . .,"117 and "But I have come to make you aware . . ."118 He himself is aware of the delicacy of his task and the esoteric nature of some of his teachings. At times, he provides only hints and then says no more except: "If you are among those who understand, a little hint is sufficient for you."119 At one point, he refers to the dangers of going too far in the mystical search.120 He knows, too, that "there are things which the thought latches on to and strives for, which cannot be expressed in words."121 Nevertheless, in general, R. David is eager to transmit what he can express, or what he feels is permissible to reveal. This eagerness to publicize and share the secrets of Kabbalah leads R. David to cull material from a number of Kabbalists, and include these selections in his Commentary. To put it another way, his sense of mission is not limited to his own formulations. In fact, he employs the phrase (112) SMhZ, 226,29; cf. כAqdamut Millin', B.T. Shabbat 11a. (113) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 109, n. 214. In these cases, R. David often employs the expression (ד"א (דבר אחר. (114) There is widespread usage of the phrase (ואתה צריך לדעת (ואצ"ל. which may be translated, "And you must realize. . see ibid., n. 215. Though this phrase is found in other contemporary texts, R. David employs it with particular fervor; see, e.g., below, n. 122. (115) Cf. the statement by Mosheh de Leon in Sefer Hamishqal (p. 137): מימים מועטין נתפשט מענין הסוד הזה בארץ. In the Basle edition (1608) this line reads: נתפשט מעין הסוד.

David draws water from the Spring with whatever vessels are available and provides it to his fellow Jews. VI It is not yet feasible to provide a full description of R. David's Kabbalistic system. His other major works are extant only in manuscript and await their redemption.124 However, there is enough original material in SMhZSMhZ to to enable us to identify a number of R. David's contributions to Kabbalistic thought. In the following pages, I will discuss these ideas and formula tions in the context of 13th century Spanish Kabbalah. As a Kabbalist, R. David relies on "tradition" as the mainstay of his thought. Thus it comes as no surprise that most of his writing reflects Kabbalistic doctrine as it had developed by the end of the 13th century.125 However, R. David obviously possesses a creative mystical mind. Having entered the hall of enlightenment,126 he, too, gazes into the mirrors and records what he sees. (122) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. no, n. 223. Cp. SMhZ, 170,10 ff. with Abulafia's Sha'arSha'ar Harazim (Munich MS 209), fol. 78r; in transcribing this Kabbalistic secret, R. David deletes Abulafia's words of hesitation and instead writes: (ואצ''ל (ואתה צייד לדעת! (123) See above, n. 115. (124) See Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, pp. 7-9, and above, nn. 4-6.

There is also much valuable material in Tishby's Mishnat Hazohar, 2 Vols. (Jerusalem, 1961, 1971), in the introductions to each section, and in his edition of R. cAzriel'sPerushHa'aggadot (Jerusalem, 1945). (126) See R. David's statement: והסוד בזה. ..לכל מי שנכנס בבי אידרא (SMhZ, 116,28, and see the source note in the apparatus). Cf. Zohar III 127b Cidra Rabba): וכבר עאלו באדרא דבי משכנא; III 287b Cidra Zula): אינון חברייא דאשתכחו בבי אדרא יזדמנון הבא. Cp. Shir Hashirim Rabba, Sec. 7, Par. 6: אדרא דאזהרה, "a rounded place of enlightenment" (Marcus Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumimetc.Targumimetc. [New York, 1967], p. 18a); there the phrase refers to the hall of the Sanhedrin. For a full discussion of the range of meaning of אדרא in the Zohar, see the valuable study by Yehudah Liebes, Peraqim Bemillon Sefer Hazohar (Ph.D diss., Hebrew University, 1976), pp. 93-107. See also Tishby, Mishnat Hazohar, Vol. 1, p. 28 (Hebrew pagination), note. For R. David, those who have "entered the hall" are the mystical adepts, his own Kabbalistic "circle." This pregnant phrase deserves further study. Its use and connotation in the Zohar and in contemporary Kabbalistic writings may help explain how the //awayya of the late 13th century assembled and engaged in mystical practice. Furthermore, the nature and process of the Zohar's composition may be connected with the Sitz im Leben of the אדרא.</page><page sequence="21">[21] DAVID BEN YEHUDAH HEHASID AND HIS BOOK OF MIRRORS 149 A. The Infinite 3Ein Sof, the Infinite, is referred to by R. David as the causa causarum, cIllatcIllat HaHllot.m It is totally beyond the scope of human comprehension and can be described only as "the most hidden."128 The Infinite must include the whole universe: R. David applies to it the midrashic statement, "He includes (lit. "is the place of') the world; the world does not include Him."129 The ten Sefirot, which flow out of the Infinite, remain united with it "because that which is emanated is not separate from the Emanator."130 The Infinite cannot be described or named, and therefore, some Kabbalists held the view that3Ein Sof is not mentioned or even hinted at in the Bible.131 R. David, however, does not hesitate to identify certain words and names in the Torah as referring directly to cIllat Hacillot.132 In one such passage, he discusses the difference between the Infinite and the ten Sefirot: "Ben"Ben Menasheh" (Num. 27:1). This hints at (or 'refers to') QIllat Hacillot,Hacillot, who is called Menasheh. Why is cIllat Hacillot called Menasheh? Because He is a place to which forgetting and oblivion (נשיון)(נשיון) pertain, in the sense of "For God has made me forget" (כי נשני אלהיםאלהים) (Gen. 41:51)■ Why is this so? Because concerning all the levels and sources (the Sefirot), one should probe and explore and search for their existence from the Depth of Supernal Wisdom.133 (127) SMhZ, 44,26. This phrase entered medieval Hebrew through the translations of Yehuda ibn Tibbon; see, e.g., his Hebrew translation of Bahya ibn Paquda's Kitáb al-Hidáya ilá Fará' id al-Qulüb: Hovot Halevavot,ilá Fará' id al-Qulüb: Hovot Halevavot,ilá Fará' id al-Qulüb: Hovot Halevavot, Shacar Hayihud, Chapter 2. From works such as this, the phrase was adopted by the first Kabbalists in Provence, e.g. R. 'Avraham ben David; cf. Scholem, Ursprung, pp. 187, 197. In 13th century Spanish Kabbalah, the phrase is not commonly used; the Zohar avoids it completely, though it appears regularly in the Tiqqune ZoharZohar and the Racaya Mehemna; cf. Tishby, MishncU Hazohar Vol. 1, pp. 100, 112 (Hebrew pagination). Cp. Mosheh de Leon's Shushan cEdut, p. 337. R. David may have picked up the phrase from Yosef ben Shalom Ashkenazi; cf. the latter's Commentary on Sefer Yezirah, pp. 53, 55• (128) SMhZ, 53,20; 224,19. (129) Beresh.it Rabba, Sec. 68, Par. 9, pp. 777-78; cf. parallels there; SMhZ, 124,29; cf. 40, 55 ff. (130) SMhZ, 131, 4. (Cf. the Ramban's Commentary to Num. 11:17: °אעילות בכל מ?י לשון ענוב.) (131) See the remarkable statement by the anonymous author of Macarekhet Ha^elohut (Mantua, 1558; photocopy: Jerusalem, 1963), p. 82b: ודע כי האי' סוף אשר זכרנו איננו רמוז לא בתורה ולא בנביאים ולא בכתובים ולא בדברי רז''ל אך קבלו בו בעלי העבודה קעת רמז. (132) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 113, n. 243. (133) This phrase may denote Keter cElyon (the highest Sefirah), which is the source or "depth" oiHokhmah, or it may refer simply to the inner essence of Hokhmah itself. These two interpretations are not mutually exclusive, for one Sefirah flows into the other.</page><page sequence="22">150 DANIEL CHANAN MATT [22] From there it is possible to understand one thing from another.134 However, concerning cIllat Hacillot, there is no side in any dimension (lit. 'place') either to search or to probe; nor can one know anything of Him, because He is hidden and secret in the mystery of Absolute Nothingness.135 Therefore, forgetting pertains to Him, as regards comprehension of this place. So open your eyes and see this great and awesome secret. Happy is he whose eyes shine from this secret, both in this world and the world-to-come.136 The Infinite can in no way be comprehended. It is completely inacces sible to the searching mind. The language here is cryptic, however. First of all, why the word "forgetting"? What, exactly, is forgotten? A lack of knowledge is not the same as forgetting. Secondly, what is the "great and awesome secret" which will light up the eyes of the true adept? Is it simply recognizing that there are limits beyond which human knowledge cannot advance? This seems more like a blindfold than an eye-opener! Perhaps, R. David is pointing to something more profound. The Sefirot are stages of contemplative ascent, and each one of them serves as an object or focus of mystical search. In tracing back the "existence" of each Sefirah to its source in Keter, the mystic uncovers layers of being within himself and throughout the cosmos. This is the knowledge which the Kabbalist strives for, "Supernal Wisdom." However, there is even a higher level, a deeper realm, beyond this step-by-step approach. At the ultimate stage, the Kabbalist no longer "understands one thing from another." Discursive thought, with all its connections and distinctions, is (134) סכיניו דבר מתיו־ דבר. The phrase originates in the Talmud (B.T. Hagigah 14aUkhere it constitutes the definition of a navon. Isaac the Blind (c. 1160-1235) alters the woixung to התבוננות דבר מתוך דבר, to describe the contemplative vision of the Sefirot; see his Perush SeferSefer YezirahYezirah (printed as an appendix to Scholem's Hakabbalah Beprovans (Jerusalem, 1970), p. 5. cAzriel of Gerona uses a similar phrase in his Shacar Hakavannah to describe the mystical ascent; see the Hebrew text published by Scholem, "Der Begriff der Kawwana in der alten Kabbala,"Kabbala," MGWJ 78 (1934); 511-12, and the discussion in Ursprung, pp. 368-71. Gikatilla also employs the phrase in the closing lines of Sha'are :Orah, p. 197. In all these instances, it is clear that davar means or implies Sefirah. (Cp. Mosheh de Leon's interesting usage: Shushan cEdut,cEdut, pp. 338-39.) Cf. Ursprung, p. 233; p. 388, n. 154; Tishby, Perush Ha'aggadol, pp. 107, 110, and Tishby's remark, p. 35, n. 8. R. David no doubt follows this tradition; see SMhZ, 119,22. (135) בסוד האין והאפס. This phrase may be understood in two ways: 1) 'Illat Hacillot is hidden within the mystery oiKeter (often referred to as יAyin), or 2) cIllatHaHllot is hidden by being in the state of (בבחינת) Absolute Nothingness. The word בסוד carries both connotations in Kabbalistic literature. Cf. SMhZ, 44,27. On the concept of ,Ayin, which plays a central role in 13th century Kabbalah, see Scholem, Ursprung, p. 178, n. 6; Major Trends, pp. 217-19; Kabbalah,Kabbalah, pp. 94-95; and his "Schópfung aus Nichts und Selbstverschrankung Gottes," Uber einigeeinige Grundbegriffe des Judentums (Frankfurt am Main, 1970), pp. 53-89.

Over whelmed by his encounter with the Infinite, the Kabbalist forgets every thing finite and specific, including his own limited self. "Oblivion" is the only word that pertains to this place, to this dimension of Reality.139 The Kabbalist returns to the finite world. His direct experience of the Divine cannot be expressed or communicated or even fully recalled. In this sense, too, "forgetting pertains to Him, as regards comprehension of this place." Nevertheless, the mystic retains a gleam in his eye, for he has caught a glimpse of the Infinite, and uncovered, if only for a moment, the great and awesome secret of Being. B. The Relationsh i p of Keter to cIllat Ha'illot The relationship of Keter to *Ein Sof was a topic of much debate and controversy among the Kabbalists of the late 13th and early 14th cen turies.140 Some of them actually identified the two,141 while others held that that Keter was a distinct Sefirah, having been emanated fromEin Sof. The view of the Zohar was in between these two positions. There,3Ein Sof and Keter are not identified with each other, but, on the other hand, Keter is (137) cAzriel speaks of the "annihilation" of thought (אפיסתה) which occurs at the highest levels of contemplation. He also calls Aeier, 'afisat hamahshavah; see Perush Ha'aggadot, pp. 40, 116; cf. Scholem, "Te'udah Hadashah Letoledot Reshit HakabbalahSefer Bialik (Tel Aviv, 1934), p. 160, n. 8; Mosheh de Leon also employs the phrase; see Shushan cEdut, p. 334. Cp. SMh?, 279, 6-8; Scholem, Reshit Hakabbalah (Tel Aviv, 1948), pp. 116-17. (138) Isaac the Blind similarly says that contemplation of the innermost essences is beyond "knowledge." It can only be experienced through a primal state of "sucking": ,והן הויות פנימיות ודקות, איו בדיה יכולה להתבונן אלא היונק ממנה, שהוא דרו התבוננות דרך יניקתו ולא דרך ידיעה Perush Perush Sefer Yezirah, p. 1; cf. Scholem's remarks, Ursprung, pp. 246-47. (13g) Cp. the statement by the famous Sufi mystic, Abü Yazld al-Bistámí: "When he brought me to the brink of the Divine Unity, I divorced myself and betook myself to my Lord, calling upon Him to help me. 'Master,' I cried, 'I beseech Thee as one to whom nothing else remains.' When he recognized the sincerity of my prayer, and how I had despaired of myself, the first token that came to me proving that He had answered this prayer was that He caused me to forget myself utterly, and to forget all creatures and all dominions" (al Sahlaji, KitábKitáb al-Nür [ed. Badawi], p. 11g, translated in A. J. Arberry, Revelation and Reason in Islam [London, 1957], p. 96). On the Islamic mystical doctrine of/and5, developed by Abü Yazld, see R. A.

R. David basically adopts the view of the Zohar. On the one hand, he makes it clear that Hllat HaHllot is beyond the realm of the Sefirot, which includes includes Keter.1*3 On the other hand, cIllat HaHllot and Keter are described together as "hidden and secret,"144 and as the two "depths."145 They stand over against the lower Sefirot as "kings" and "elders."146 Their relationship with each other is more difficult to describe. In an enigmatic sentence, appearing twice in SMhZ, R. David says, concerning these two realms: "There is no difference between the Cause and that which is caused except that one is the Cause and the other, caused. He who is enlightened147 will understand and hold his silence before God."148 The Primal Cause is, by definition, prior to Keter, and, yet, the two realms are otherwise identical. What this means, presumably, is that Keter represents that aspect of the Infinite which turns toward Creation. It is the channel by means of which the completely hidden God begins to reveal Itself. As R. David puts it: (Keter) "causes its goodness and love to flow out from cIllat HaHllot, from the Channel of the hidden, secret Pool."149 Together, Hllat HaHllot and Keter are the source of emanation. The former is the hidden root, the latter the subtle beginnings of growth. There is no actual separation between the two. Keter "is tied together and connected with the nexus of (7 (בקשרHat HaHllot, for there, there is no separation or division. Rather, everything is completely whole."150 In fact, Keter Keter is so united with the Infinite that sometimes it shares in the designa don °Ein Sof, when the flow of emanation is described.151 (142) Tishby, Mishnal Hauohar, p. 109.

The cEser Zahzahot The first hidden signs of the process of emanation appear within Keter. On this, almost all of the Spanish Kabbalists agree.152 However, R. David holds a unique theory concerning these primordial stages which is hardly mentioned by anyone before him, and which reappears in a different form in 15th and 16th century Kabbalah. This is the doctrine of the cEser Zahzahot,Zahzahot, ten splendors, or translucent lights, which precede the emana tion of the Sefirot. It is difficult to ascertain from whom R. David acquired this theory, if, indeed, he acquired it from anyone. His formulations on the cEser Zahzahot Zahzahot are mostly brief and obscure. It is possible that a similar theory is referred to by Isaac the Blind (c. 1160-1235), in his Commentary on Sefer Yezirah.Yezirah. There, in a passage which itself is quite cryptic, we read: והדברים יש להן מדות ושיעור, אך המחשבה אין לה שעור ולכד הולכות בעשר עשר, לפיכך מן הדקות הרשומות, כי עשר מעשר דקות מפנימיות הדקות.153 Scholem, trying to decipher the meaning of this passage, wonders whether Isaac is referring to a secret decade within Mahshavah (Keter), beyond the Sefirot, which represents a prior stage of emanation.154 This is certainly plausible. The next link in the chain is a responsum written in Provence shortly after Isaac's Commentary, though attributed to Ha"¡ Ga3on.155 There it is stated that above all the Sefirot there exist in "The Root of all Roots" three hidden lights: 3or penimi qadmon, 3or mezuhzah and 3or zah. These three constitute one essence and form a kind of Kabbalistic trinity preceding the emanation of the ten Sefirot.156 This prior triad was probably posited in order to make the ten Sefirot conform with the Thirteen Attributes of God. Whatever the purpose, the theory of the three supernal lights opened the door for further speculation on the deepest levels of emana tion. It also provided the terminology for the doctrine of the cEser Zahzahot. (152) The locus classicus is Zohar I 15a; there, סהירו עלאה refers to Keter. (153) Isaac the Blind, Perush Sefer Yezirah, p. 3. (154) Ursprung, pp. 240-43. His translation of the passage is a feat in itself. (155) The text is translated and discussed in Ursprung, pp. 308-14; cf. Kabbalah, pp. 95-6. R. David copies several lines of this responsum as part of his long selection from Xodros Abulafla: SMhZ, 170,15. (156) Later Christians interpreted this theory as supporting the Doctrine of the Trinity, though it contains none of the personal hypostases characteristic of the Christian Triad; see Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 96.</page><page sequence="26">154 DANIEL CHANAN MATT [26] In SMhZ, R. David refers to the zEser Zahzahot eleven times. Two of these references consist of no more than the phrase itself and a proof-text from Isaiah 58:11: 157.והשביע בצחצחות נפשך Some of the other passages are also quite cryptic. However, by fitting the pieces together, by "under standing one thing from another," it is possible to construct a coherent picture of R. David's speculation. The cEser Zahzahot are parallel to the cEser Sefirot. This is clear even in those passages where R. David is hesitant and secretive; for example: u,cAseru,cAser Tacaser' (Deut. 14:22). Why two times (the root ceser)? Because here there is a deep and hidden secret which the mouth cannot speak nor the ear hear. You already know that caser refers to (or "hints at") the ten lower (Sefirot). Until here I have permission to explain. If you are one of the enlightened, you will understand this great secret with your fullest intel lectual capacity (במיטב שכלך) and will surely not let it out of your mouth."158 The ten Sefirot are "lower" than the cEser Zahzahot, which in another passage are called "ten supernal Sefirot."159 The cEser Zahzahot are located in Keter and are referred to as "ten Sefirot of Keter cElyon," though they are also said to belong to cIllat Hacillot.1e&lt;&gt; As opposed to the "lower" Sefirot, "you cannot comprehend anything concerning the ten Sefirot of Keter cElyon."i61 The function of the cEser Zahzahot is explained in another passage: "'God's words are pure words' (Ps. 12:7). 'God's words.' The secret is that these are the ten statements by which the world was created. And these statements are ten inner, hidden levels, which are cEser Zahzahot which spread out within Keter cElyon . . . and from these ten statements all existing things were created and brought into being; and everything which emanates (שישתלשל) from Keter cElyon and below is drawn forth and goes out from these ten statements. Therefore, it is written: 'God's words are pure words.'"162 The cEser Zahzahot are thus the source of emanation within Keter. They give rise to the ten Sefirot and, then, to all created being. They represent higher sefirotic models, the blueprint of the ten Sefirot. However, unlike the "engravings" and "etchings" spoken of in the Zohar,163 the Zahzahot are distinct and individual essences, ordering all of Creation. (157) SMhZ, 24,31; 68,12.

David so secretive about the theory? There are several possible possible explanations. Since it treats of the subtle beginnings of emana tion, he probably felt that it was too delicate to expose. As he often writes in SMhZ, כבוד אלהים הסתר דבר (Prov. 25:2).166 Also, based on the fact that there are no other explicit references to the cEser cZahzahot in this period,167 it is quite likely that the theory was not widely shared. R. David may have imposed censorship on himself to avoid criticism. Finally, he may have developed or elaborated the theory on his own, as a result of contemplative practice and mystical vision. Striving to discover the first roots of emanation, R. David was dazzled by ten sparkling, translucent flashes. He connected his experience with the verse from Isaiah (58:11), which he interpreted: "God will satisfy your soul with Zahzahot." Here, too, he would be hesitant to publicize the intimate details. All of these may have been factors in his decision to guard the secret nature of the cEser Zahzahot.168 (164) Yehudah Hayyat, in his lengthy commentary on the anonymous work, Ma'arekhet Ha'elohut,Ha'elohut,Ha'elohut, speaks of ten zif1z.uhm within 3Ein Sof, and three within Keter\ see Ma'arekhet Ha'elohut,Ha'elohut, pp. 44a-b; 45b. 5Elhanan Halevi, an Italian Kabbalist living at the turn of the 16th century, follows Hayyat's view; see Gottlieb, "5Or 'Olam le-R. 5Elhanan Sagi Nahor," Mefiqarim,Mefiqarim, pp. 397-476. Both of these Kabbalists identify the ten "supernal Sefirot" as5Adam Adam De'azilut■,Dé'azilvt■, cf. David ibn Zimra, Migdal David, p. 37a, who quotes from SMhZ (see Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 111, n. 229). The entire theory is criticized by R.

Yizhaq mar Hayyim cal Torat Ha?ahzahot," Tarbiz 26 (&gt;957): 440-58• (165) Cordovero tries to combine the theory of three lights, based on the Pseudo-Ha'i Responsum,Responsum, with the doctrine of cEser Zahzahot.

Keter as Mahshavah For R. David, cIllat HaHllot is united with Keter and the cEser Zahzahot are situated within Keter. Thus, this Sefirah is the vessel through which all emanation begins to flow. R. David calls it by many names to indicate this key function: "the spring of the stream," "the spring of the supernal river," "the supernal pool," "the supernal river whose waters never cease."169 It is an ever-flowing source. He also applies to it the more standard Kabbalistic expressions, "Nothingness" and "Will."170 However, his favorite expression for Keter is עולם המחשבה, "the world of Thought."171 There are many variations on this phrase: "the deep Thought," "the supernal secret of Thought," "the Thought of the Hidden," or simply "the quality of Thought."172 This designation has an interesting history. In Sefer Habahir, which was edited in Provence in the late 12th century and represents the first Kabbalistic text, Mahshavah is the name for Keter.113 Isaac the Blind, who played a major role in the early growth of Kabbalah, adopted this view.174 However, as the Kabbalah spread from Provence to Spain, a change occurred which is rather revealing. Many Kabbalists of the Gerona school, among them R. cAzriel, applied the designation Mahshavah not to Keter but to the second Sefirah, Hokhmah.175 For them, Razon (The Divine Will) occupied the first place. By stressing the volitional character of the Divine, these Kabbalists were attempting to harmonize the Plotinian conception of an Infinite One (corresponding to 3Ein Sof) with the traditional Jewish view of a Personal God.176 Gabirol's "Doctrine of the Will" may have influenced this change of tone and terminology.177 Most Kabbalists of the 13th and 14th centuries accepted this new nomenclature. The Zohar, too, identifies Keter as "Will," though there is some intertwining of "Will" and "Thought."178 R. David, however, clearly (16g) Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 118, n. 280.

For him the mystery of Thought represents most clearly the deepest secrets of the Divine. At one point he sets up an analogy between Keter and human thought in order to explain this designation: And since He (Keter) is secret and hidden from comprehension, therefore He is called Mahshavah, like the Mahshavah which is secret and hidden in the human being and which no one can see or describe as (one can describe) the other qualities. Rather, she sees everything that exists and she herself is not seen, that is, the Mahshavah. Thus, Keter Keter cElyon sees and observes and looks at everything that exists while He, Himself, is neither seen nor comprehended by any crea ture in the world. Therefore, He is called Mahshavah. Don't read (the word as) Mahshavah but rather Mah Shavah, that is, Moah shebah, i.e. the Holy Brain which is inside Keter cElyon, which sits in clear, pure ether that cannot be comprehended179 by intellect or reason.180 Pure Divine Thought, completely hidden yet all-seeing, is parallel to human thought. It is fair to assume that R. David's own contemplative journeys led him to this analogy. By following the map of the Sefirot he penetrated further and further into the interior spaces of his mind, finally breaking through to the vastness of the Divine Mind. Such an experience is, by its nature, ineffable. As stated elsewhere in SMhZ, "there are things which the Mahshavah latches on to (or "comprehends") and strives for, which cannot be expressed in words.181 Yet the mystic as writer, with the help of the midrashic method, transmits something of his vision: Mah shavah shavah = Moah shebah, "the Holy Brain which is inside Keter cEly on, which sits in clear, pure ether that cannot be comprehended by intellect or reason." This description is a reflection of what R. David has seen in the mirror of Mahshavah .182 3OroA, pp. 188, 190. Mosheh de Leon equatesMahshavah and Seferat Hokhmah in his Shushan zEdut,zEdut, p. 375.

The Personification of Keter In the Zohar, which represents the crystallization of 13th century Kabbalah,Kabbalah, Keter is almost always abstract and depersonalized. Nothing can really be predicated of this Sefirah. It acts on no object.183 In fact, almost all of the Zohar's descriptions of Keter are intentionally vague and ethereal.ethereal. Keter is the "supernal purity," "the fine, supernal ether."184 Only in the 7droi of the Zohar, which abound in extremely anthropomorphic imagery, is Keter described more directly and concretely.185 Keter and3Ein Sof,Sof, together, comprise cAttiqa Qadisha, the Holy Ancient One. However, even in these sections, the tone is descriptive rather than dynamic. The aloofness and absolute "otherness" of Keter are conveyed both by the cryptic language and the esoteric setting.186 R. David, as we have seen, often describes Keter as hidden and unknowable. Furthermore, his desig nation of Keter as Mahshavah lends an abstract quality to this Sefirah. However, R. David does not describe Keter in purely abstract terms. On the contrary, one of his novel and striking contributions is the personifica tion of Keter. This personification is evident in a number of roles which are assigned to Keter. First of all He is described, very graphically and anthropomor phically, as standing at the head of the Sefirot: "And you must realize, 'high priest' (Lev. 21:10) refers to (or "hints at") Keterc.El-yon, who is called high priest because He is priest and lord over all the levels . . . because He anoints all the lower priests with the anointing oil which flows down from the Spring of the Stream."187 Keter Keter is the "Master of all the levels,"188 chief among all the Sefirot. How far R. David is willing to go in applying human attributes to this Master is demonstrated in the following section: "'How can one pursue a thousand?' (Deut. 32:20). This means that the 'One,' who is Keter cElyon, runs after a thousand levels,189 which are emanated from Him, and He warns them and urges them concerning the mizvot of the Torah, saying, for example: 'Justice, justice shall you pursue' (183) See Tishby, Mishnat Hawhar, Vol. 1, p. 132. (184) Zohar I 15a; III 2a. (185) The 'Idrot had a particularly strong influence on R. David. His entire Sefer Hagevul is based on the 'Idra Rabba, and in SMh%, too, its influence is felt; see Matt, SMh?, Introduc tion, p. 120, n. 299. (186) See e.g. Zohar III 288b ('Idra Zuta)', and Tishby, Mishnat Hawhar, Vol. 1, pp. 110-11. (187) SMhZ, 81, 25-27. (188) Ibid., 234, 17. (189) The decade of Sefirot is sometimes squared once or twice by R. David and other Kabbalists; cf. ibid., 68, 10; 101, 8; 186, 19; 272,20; and Zohar I 209b, II 200a.</page><page sequence="31">[31] DAVID BEN YEHUDAH HEHASID AND HIS BOOK OF MIRRORS I59 (Deut. 16:20). But,190 the quality of One (Keter) is like a rabbi running after his students, stimulating them in order to sharpen and stimulate their minds, so that they will understand Wisdom."191 This represents quite a novel description of the yeshivah shel macalah! What is so striking is that R. David is here describing the same Sefirah which he earlier said was "hidden in the depth of Thought."192 His midrashic mind is apparently capable of taking the most abstract concept and personifying it, dramatizing it, even presenting it as a teaching rabbi. R. David does not limit his personifications of Keter to descriptions involving the other Sefirot. Since .Keter is the source of emanation, He can also be described as the Creator. Not only does He bring the Sefirot into being; He also "made and created everything that exists."193 "He is our God and He created us and all the worlds."194 Sometimes, R. David identifies Keter simply as נ£/ or "The Holy One, Blessed be He."195 He is also called Yacaqov Sava, YisraDel Sava, and Mosheh Sava.196 By describing Keter as the God of Creation and "The Holy One, Blessed be He," R. David includes the highest realm of the Sefirot within the framework of traditional Jewish theology. This was, perhaps, his way of resolving the conflict between "the God of Plotinus and the God of the Bible."197Bible."197 Keter, for R. David, is not only the abstruse and ethereal world of Mahshavah.Mahshavah. He is also the God of Israel who responds to prayer: ". . . Therefore we ask for water on these days (Sukkot), so that the Holy One, Blessed be He, who is Keter cElyon, will cause His fountains to flow out to us limitlessly."198 Different perspectives on the Divine have coalesced in R. David's mind. For him, there is no conflict between theosophy and tradition. The mystic who yearns for the emanation of Divine Light is none other than the Jew (190) This *אל seems out of context, unless, perhaps, R. David means: "Believe it or not, KeterKeterKeter is really like a rabbi!" (191) SMhZ, 260, 21-4. R. David adduces this interpretation as proof that the Sefirot themselves perform the mizvot; see lines 25-6; cf. Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 102. This passage is part of Parashat Ha'azinu, which abounds in creative and striking interpretations. (192) SMhZ, 208,6. R. David here adds the words בעומק המחשבה to Gikatilla's description of Keter : הי* נסתרת ונעלמת. (193) Ibid &gt; 25911'• (194) Ibid., 188,12. (195) Ibid., 221,15; 96,15; 116,5.

The name YisrcPel Sava is applied to Ya'aqov in the Midrash; see, e.g.,BereshitRabba, Sec. 68, Par. 11, p. 784, and Theodor's note there; cf.

The Relationship between Keter and Malkhut The personification of Keter finds expression in another role as well. Within the realm of the Divine, Keter has a direct relationship with the last Sefirah, Malkhut. This, too, constitutes an innovation on the part of R. David and reinforces the unity and dynamic nature of the Sefirot. The relationship between Malkhut and Keter is described most basically as that of a loyal subject to his God: "Keneset Yisra3el (Malkhut) does not accept upon Herself any of the powers of the Outside Forces, 199 but rather, Keter cElyon. She bows down to Him and accepts Him as God God ."200Keter is Her Lord and Master. In more human terms, She is the laborer and Keter is the bacal habayit.201 Malkhut Malkhut is subservient to Keter. However, in this position, She receives the Divine flow of emanation from Him: "She includes everything202 and receives from the All,203 who is the Quality of Deep Thought (Keter)."204 This flow is the source oiMalkhut's dominion over the lower worlds: "When She receives from the supernal3Alef205 then She reigns and rules over all of the levels beneath Her."206 R. David, at times, applies parallel descriptions to Keter and Malkhut. The highest Sefirah is the "upper eye"; the last Sefirah, the "lower eye."207 One is Hu3; the other, Vehu3.208 The similarity in names is indica tive of the close relationship between these two Sefirot. This is demon strated in the following passage: ((1 gg) החיצוניות, i.e. the Demonic realm; see below, Sec. VI, H. (200) SMhZ, 40, 2-4. (201) Ibid., 77,17. (202) היא כוללת הכל. This phrase has its roots in SeferHabahir, Par. 156 (Scholem,DasBuck Bahir,Bahir, Par. 104). A Commentary on the Sefirot from the school of the Ramban says of Malkhut: היא כנסת הכל. See Scholem, "Schechina," p. 166. The phrase הכלה הכלולה מן הכל appears often in 13th century Spanish Kabbalah. (203) It should be noted that כל in earlier Kabbalistic literature refers not to Keter but to Yesod,Yesod, situated directly above Malkhut; see Sefer Habahir, Par. 22 (Scholem, Das Buch Bahir, Par. 14); 'Azriel, Perush Ha'aggadot, p. 57. R. David's contemporaries also follow this tradition, e.g. Gikatilla, Shacare נOrah, p. 57; and the Zohar. The identification is often connected with I Chron. 29:11. In substituting Keter for Yesod, R. David takes a new step and stresses the direct relationship between the first and last Sefirot.

For, just as He is called Keter zElyon, soMalkhut is called zAteretzAteret which means 'crown' . . . When zAteret Yisra°el joins Herself with Keter cElyon and rises up to נEin Sof, then they are called 0Atarot."2"9 The common designation points to a higher union. Such a complete union may be possible only in Messianic times.210 This is the ultimate relationship between Keter and Malkhut. The depiction of the hieros gamos, the mystical marriage within the realm of Divinity, represents one of the most novel and striking contribu tions of the Zohar to Kabbalistic thought.211 Scholem, in one of his most important contributions to the understanding of Kabbalistic thought, says that the appearance of this sexual symbolism represents a re-emergence of myth within the world of medieval Judaism.212 According to the Zohar, Tiferet,Tiferet, the masculine aspect of God, and Malkhut, the feminine, unite under the right conditions, and their union causes blessing and light to flow to all the lower worlds.213 R. David adopts this view and, in several places, speaks of the joining of these two Sefirot.214 However, in other passages it appears that Tiferet is not so much a partner of Malkhut as Her channel, conducting the Divine flow from above: "Tiferet conducts the flows and the different types of emanation to the Queen."215 "The Holy One, Blessed be He {Tiferet) prays before Keter cElyon and zIllat Hazillot216 and draws the abundant flow from the Depth of the Spring, who is called Keter zElyon, to Keneset Yisra*el (Malkhut). Thus, Keneset Yisra3el is blessed through Him ('Tiferet)."217 (209) Ibid.., 228, 18-20, 29-30. (210) Ibid., 20-29. This middle section, which I have deleted in the translation above, is copied from Gikatilla's Sha'are נOrah, p. 102. Gikatilla there speaks of the union of Tiferet and and Malkhut.and Malkhut. R David uses the quotation to demonstrate the union of Keter and Malkhxd. Cf. SMhZ, 113, 21-24. (211) In Sefer Habahir, there is no overt sexual symbolism with regard to the Sefirot. The ShekhinahShekhinah is primarily God's daughter. See Scholem's suggestive, dialectical remark ("Schechina," p. 164): "Zu dieser Symbolik [hieros gamos] istes noch nichtwieder vorgestos sen, oder soil ich sagen: zurückgekehrt!?" (212) See Scholem, "Schechina," pp. 164, 177; idem, Major Trends, pp. 225-230; idem, "Kabbalah and Myth," On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism (New York, 1965), pp. 104-5.

(217) SMhZ, 110,4.</page><page sequence="34">162 DANIEL CHANAN MATT [34] The source of the flow is in Keter. Tiferet, representing Him, transmits the flow and thus brings about the union. However, in one passage, R. David actually says that it is Keter Himself who marries Malkhut: "'He (Vehu0)(Vehu0)(Vehu0) may marry only a woman who is a virgin.' (Lev. 21:3, referring to the high priest). . . But according to the way of truth,218 Vehuנ, that is Keter QElyonQElyon who is called Hu*... 'a woman who is a virgin' refers to (or "hints at") the Queen (Malkhut) . . ."219 For R. David, Keter and Malkhut are partners who, through joining, consummate Divine Being and provide life and blessing to the world. It is a sin to break the connection between them.220 The connection is vital and works in both directions. From the human perspective, Malkhut is the passageway leading ultimately to the highest Sefirah: "By means of Z03t, which is Keneset Yisra^el, a person can ascend and probe the existence of the Intellect which is Keter cElyon."22i The downward flow of emanation creates a path which can be climbed as well, through mystical contemplation of the Sefirot. The direct relationship between the highest and lowest spheres prepares the way for the journey from the human to the Divine. In describing the Sefirot between Keter and Malkhut, R. David generally follows earlier Kabbalistic traditions. He contributes some new images and symbols, and weaves them into many mystical-midrashic patterns, but, on the whole, the basic ideas are not new. However, when speaking of the tenth Sefirah, Malkhut, he offers several important and striking for mulations. G. The Independent Quality of Malkhut The concept of Malkhut, or Shekhinah, is among the most significant ideas of the Kabbalah.222 The notion of a feminine aspect of Divinity, formulated by the Jewish mystics of the 12th and 13th centuries, became a keystone of all Kabbalistic thought and had a profound effect on the masses of Jews from the 14th century on. The Zohar, in particular, abounds with images and descriptions of the Shekhinah, and R. David was strongly influenced by many of these. (218) This phrase is often used by the Ramban to introduce Kabbalistic teachings in his Commentary Commentary on the Torah. (219) SMhZ, 87,28. Such an interpretation never appears in the Zohar, where there is hardly any mention of relationship between Keter and Malkhut; cp. Zohar II 54a. (220) SMhZ, 244, 28-40. (221) Ibid., 45,6.

She is described as "having nothing at all of Her own."223 Yet, because of this very quality, She is able to receive and reflect all of the upper Sefirot. Thus, She includes and contains everything.224 However, She has an active, "masculine" side as well. When bestowing blessings upon the world, She "is called masculine, like the male who provides blessings for the female."225 As Provider and Ruler of the world, the Shekhinah's active side reveals itself. From the perspective of the lower worlds, She is a powerful Governess, while from a higher perspective, She is simply transmitting the flow of blessing or Divine chastisement.228 R. David follows the basic outline of the Zohar's teachings on Shekhinah. He, too, says that "She has nothing at all of Her own."227 All of the upper lights and colors are reflected in Her.228 In fact, the title Mar30t Hazove^ot refers to the capacity of Malkhut to act as a mirror for the other Sefirot.229 However, what is new in R. David's teachings is his emphasis on the active element within the Shekhinah. More specifically, he stresses the independent side of Her nature. This can be seen already in his first original piece of writing in SMhZ, which constitutes an elaboration on a Zohar passage: . . . And this is why we say (in the Necilah Service on Yom Kippur) "And seal"; "And seal us." Because cAteret (Malkhut) ascends to the Palace of the King (Binah), who brings out the documents to be sealed. Then, She (Malkhut) receives the documents and brings them down with Her, and seals them for Life, those are the righteous, and the wicked for Death. And that is why we pray, "And seal for Life." This means that we are praying before eAteret, who is NeHlah, that She seal us for Life. A Parable. To what can this be compared? To a king who came to sign decrees concerning his subjects, to impose burdensome taxes upon them because they had rebelled against him. The king's vice (223) לית לה מגרמה כלום, e.g.Zohar I 181a; cp. II 218b. The phrase probably derives from medieval astronomers' description of the moon; see Scholem's notes in Qovez cal Yad 8 [N.S.] (1976), p. 338, n. 60; p. 381, n. 79. Cp.

The secret of this is 'and (that which) is sealed with the king's ring cannot be reversed' (Esther 8:8). This is enough for him who understands.230 Malkhut,Malkhut, who is also Keneset Yisra3el, the mystical embodiment of the People of Israel, pleads for Israel before God. As the crucial hour draws near, however, She takes matters into Her own hands and, indepen dently, insures Israel's well being. The parable is an appropriate introduc tion to R. David's conception of Malkhut. Malkhut'sMalkhut's independent role is not limited to pleading for Israel. The power of life and death is in Her hands.231 She is an even-handed judge, capable of inflicting punishment: "She is the judge who sits at the royal gates."232 "She is in charge of all the punishments of the Supernal King and inflicts all the blows and plagues on the world."233 Malkhut,Malkhut, of course, does not act wholly on Her own. Essentially, She expresses or interprets Divine Thought. "'And who knows the interpreta tion of a thing?' (Eccles. 8:1) The quality of cAteret interprets the meaning of the Depth of Thought (Keter) before it is actualized . . . And this is the secret of 'the interpretation of a thing'."234 Malkhut Malkhut is the medium for expressing what has arisen in the depth of Mahshavah.Mahshavah. However, the primal thought emanated by Keter is incom municable as itself. It is nothing but an unspoken בAlef .235 Malkhut inter prets this flowing essence as it moves towards actualization; She spells it out and communicates it to all the lower worlds. It is precisely at this point that Her own nature expresses itself and Her independence asserts itself. R. David conveys this creative aspect of Malkhut with two remarkable images: one, his own formulation, and the other, an elaboration of a Zoharic expression. "Do not boast of tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth" (Prov. 27:1). Literally, what a day may bring forth! That well-known Day, who is Keneset Yisra^el, one of the Seven Days of the Week which He produced236 during the Six Days of Creation; that (230) SMhZ, 13, 1-9.

They are thus</page><page sequence="37">[37] DAVID BEN YEHUDAH HEHASID AND HIS BOOK OF MIRRORS 165 Divine quality receives the decree from the World of Thought (Keter)(Keter) to determine the decree according to the supernal judgment. And She is capable of changing that decree for good or for evil, as She desires. This is the secret meaning of "And God renounced the punishment" (Exod. 32:14); and, similarly, "And His heart was saddened" (Gen. 6:6). All this refers to the quality of Malkhut, who is called Sod Ha°efshar, the Secret of the Possible.237 Thus, She gives birth to whatever She wants to bring down238 to the world. There fore it says, "for you do not know what a day may bring forth"!239 The Shekhinah is Sod Ha3efshar, the field of all possibilities. Spanning the upper and lower worlds, She expresses the Divine message in whatever form She desires. She translates thought into creation: "The wages of a laborer (pocel) shall not remain with you until morning." (Lev. 19:13) .. . But the secret meaning is that the "la borer" (pocel) isKeneset Yisra3el. She is called a laborer because every thing which comes out of the World of Deep Thought (Keter) moves from potential being (min hakoah) into actuality (3el hapo^al), which is cAteretcAteret Yisra3el (Malkhut). She forms and transforms everything as seems right to Her. For She is called the Potter. Just as a potter, who shapes and fashions clay vessels, makes them either wider or nar rower while the potter's-wheel240 turns and spins in his hand; in the called "Days." See Sefer Habahir, Par. 57 (Scholem, Das Buch Bahir, Par. 39). Cf. Gikatilla's statement: ספירות הכלימה הם פעליו (Tarbiz 36 [1966-67]: 78)■ Cf. also Me'ir ibn Sahula's com ment on ויהי אור in his Be'ur Leferush Haramban, *Ozar Mefarshe Hatorah (Jerusalem, 1973), Genesis, p. 3d.

(237) This happy formulation is apparently original to R. David. It has its roots, how ever, in Kabbalistic literature. Cf. cAzriel's designation of Hokhmah as כח מה שאפשר להיות (Perush(Perush Ha'aggadot, p. 84). This is the definition of hylic matter according to Aristotle (see Tishby's note 4). 'Azriel means that Hokhmah contains within itself, in subtle form, all the lower Sefirot. R. David speaks of a creative quality which Malkhut possesses. Cf. above, n. 108, Gikatilla's emphatic use of the word אפשר in connection with the Shekhinah. See also Maimonides, MorehNevukhim, Part 3, Chapter 20; E.L.

The word appears in Zohar I 109b, with a similar description of the potter at work. There, however, the</page><page sequence="38">166 DANIEL CHANAN MATT [38] same way, Keneset Yisra3el fashions all creatures as if they were on a potter's wheel, as it is written: "Like clay in the hand of the potter (so are you in My hand, O House of Israel)" (Jer. 18:6).241 As the Shekhinah conveys the flow of the Divine, She draws on an infinite array of images and forms, for She encompasses all imagery and form.242 The Artist transforms Divine Thought into creation and the universe comes to life. To the human mind it all seems quite random, as if God were changing His Mind back and forth. But this is simply the Secret of the Possible: as the wheel spins, as the imagination of the Shekhinah unfolds, no one knows what the day may bring forth. H. The Attack of the Temurot The Shekhinah's independent creativity expresses one side of Her na ture. From another perspective, She is purely receptive, a channel for the upper Sefirot. Furthermore, She is in a rather delicate position because She possesses nothing of Her own.243 The Shekhinah is pure openness, "the mouth of His qualities."244 She is susceptible to upper influences but also vulnerable to outside forces. The powers of the Demonic can, under certain conditions, "kidnap" the Shekhinah or use Her for their own evil purposes. Since She is a vessel, She will transmit whatever is channelled towards Her, whether it is the pure Divine flow or "the venom of the snake."245 The Zohar describes the realm of the Demonic as Sitra 3Ahra, "The Other Side."246 It is the counterpart of the Divine, the dark face of Evil, and is constantly trying to overwhelm the Shekhinah and defile Her. craftsman isTiferet, who can change His works as He sees fit. Cf. Shimcon Lavi.KetemPaz, ad 10c. In SMhZ, 53, 2-10, Malkhut is identified as the טיקלא on which all souls revolve. (241) SMhZ, 77, 9-16. (242) The Shekhinah is described asTtpin דיוקנא דכליל כל, Zohar I 13a; and דמיונא דכליל בל דמיונין, Zohar Hadash 59a MhN. Cf. SMhZ, 152, 8: התמונה הכוללת כל התמונות.

The portrayal of the Shekhinah Shekhinah as being purely receptive seems to contradict the notion of Her independent creativity, discussed above. There is, however, a subtle interplay between receptivity and creativity. (244) SMhZ, 82,13. (245) והמת הנחש!. The phrase originates in the Talmud (see B. T. Shabbat 146a, Yevamot 103b), where it is said that the serpent injected its venom into Eve. The Kabbalah applies the image to the Demonic realm, often symbolized by the serpent, and its relationship to the Shekhinah',Shekhinah', see e.g. Zohar III 79a. (246) On the doctrine of Sitra 'Ahra in the Zohar, and, in particular, its relationship to the Shekhinah,Shekhinah, see Tishby,MishnatHazohar, Vol. 1, pp. 223-26; 285-307. It has been pointed out that the correct grammatical form is actually סטרא אחרינא; see Kaddari, Aftymufczt Leshon Yemei Habenayyim (Tel Aviv, 1970), p. 72.</page><page sequence="39">[39] DAVID BEN YEHUDAH HEHASID AND HIS BOOK OF MIRRORS 167 R. David does not employ the term sitra כahra247 though he adopts the Zohar's basic theory of the Demonic. In one passage, we find this startling description: ,"If you betroth a woman (another man will lie with her)' (Deut. 28:30). This means the supernal Woman, who is Keneset Yisra^el. *You will betroth Her,' i.e., She will be with you. 'Another man.' As if it were possible, Samar'el and his agents inject their venom into Her, as it says: 'will lie with her'."248 In describing the Demonic, R. David employs the image of the Temurot,249Temurot,249 forces that are parallel, though opposite, to the seven lower Sefirot. He probably borrowed this theory from his colleague, Yosef ben Shalom Ashkenazi,250 but he expands it considerably. The Temurot are produced by Keter, the highest Sefirah: ",The palm tree (hatemarah) produces both dates (temarim) and thorns.'251 . . . But the secret of the matter is that ,the palm tree' also refers to Keter cElyon, who is the highest of the high. As the palm tree is higher than all other trees, so Keter Keter is higher than all the levels (Sefirot). ,Produces both dates and thorns.' ,Dates' — these are the holy levels. ,And produces thorns,' these are their temurot (opposites, counterparts), which are called thorns and thistles."252 It is significant that R. David traces the origin of the Temurot to Keter. According to the Zohar, the forces of Evil have their roots within Gevurah, the Sefirah of strict judgment.253 Yizhaq Kohen of Soria, an earlier The demonic nature of the SitraנAhra comes across quite vividly in the Zohar. A question that has never been explored, however, is to what extent the term itself reflects a different perspective on Evil: that it is simply "the other side" of the Good. This idea is quite common in Eastern mystical literature. The question would pertain as well to R. David's special terminology discussed below. (247) In translating Zohar passages, he renders it correctly: ה1ד האחד. (248) SMhZ, 249, 9-11. (249) In biblical and rabbinic usage the term temurah denotes the exchange of one sacrificial animal for another; see Lev. 27: 10,33; Mishnah Temurah 1,1; and Jastrow, Dictionary,Dictionary, p. 1676a. In Sefer Yezirah, temurah means both pair and opposite; see Chapter 4, Mishnah 1 (cf. 1,5). Isaac the Blind speaks of temurah in the sense of development and evolution: התמורה הילכת מסבה לסבה (Commentary on Sefer Yezirah, p. 8), and also letter permuta tion. A negative or demonic connotation seems to appear for the first time in 'Azriel's writings; see Madda'e Hayahadut 2 (1987), p. 235: וכיון שחטא. ..ונדון בכל דרכי התמורות. (This passage is deleted in R. David's quotation of the text, SMhZ, 123.) Cf. also cAzriel, Madda'e Hayahadut,Hayahadut, pp. 233, 236, 237 (and SMhZ, 122, 11-12; 123,3). Cf. Zohar I 155a, where the phrase בן חמורה, borrowed from the Talmud, conveys a notion of impurity. (250) See Scholem, "Peraqim," p. 300. Cf. Yosef ben Shalom's Commentary on Sefer Yezirah,Yezirah, Chap. 4, Mishnah 1. On R. David and R. Yosef, see Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p 105, n. 183. (251) Cf.

David, on the other hand, traces the realm of the Temurot all the way to Keter, implying that the roots of Evil coexist with the roots of Emanation. In fact, in one passage he even speaks of Keter itself having an "opposite": "... even the highest Temurot, which are the counterpart of Keter cElyon."26s However, he states elsewhere: "There, there is neither temurah nor enemy, but rather, the world of love and tranquility."256 In any case, it is clear that the Temurot constitute an emanation parallel and opposite to the seven lower Sefirot.257 Together, they are also called by other names: "Enemies," "Outside Forces," and Qelippot.258 Though their source is in the highest realms, the Temurot are not nourished freely. Only "the drippings of the channels are conducted to the side of the Temurot."259 "They eat everything through the holes and pits."260 These crumbs, however, do not satisfy the Demonic forces. They want full nourishment and total power. Therefore, it isMalkhut who is the prime focus of all their efforts. Since She receives the Divine flow and, with it, rules over the world, they are out to destroy Her, snatch Her power and establish their own dominion: "The Temurah of Malkhut... is called the Mystery of the Serpent, who rides on those asses which stand beneath him,261 and he is forever pursuing Malkhut Bet David to destroy Her and establish his own malkhut."262 (254) See the text published by Scholem and his analysis in Madda'e Hayahadut 2 (1927): 182-85; 193-97; 244-64• Cf. idem, Kabbalah, pp. 122-24; idem, "Sitra 3Ahra: Hatov Vehara' Bakabbalah," Pirqe Yesod, pp. 1g1-g2. Yizhaq's student, Mosheh of Burgos, demotes the source of Evil to Gevurah, and the Zohar follows this view; cf. Tishby, MishnatHazohar, Vol. 1, p. 296, n. 2. R. David often speaks otBinah as the source of Din (e.g. SMhZ, 69, 31; 186, 22), but in regard to the Temurot, he finds a higher source. Nevertheless, R. David was probably influenced by Yizhaq's treatise. (255) SMhZ, 249,24; cf. 279,12. (256) Ibid., 271,26. (257) It is unclear whether Hokhmah and Binah are understood as having their own Temurot.Temurot. The passage on the palm tree (see above) seems to imply this, but no Temurot are specified or named for these two high Sefirot. In the latter part of SMhZ, R. David identifies each of the seven Temurot corresponding to the lower Sefirot, in his comments on the TokhehahTokhehah (Deut. 28: 15-68; SMhZ, 248-250) and on a passage in Parashat Ha'aunu (Deut. 32: 24-25; SMhZ, 260, 8-16).

However, there are times when She is left unguarded and becomes susceptible to the Outside Forces. Such a state of vulnerability is created in three stages. The first and second of these are closely connected (if not identical): the perpetration of sin in the human realm and the arousal of the Demonic.264 It is a Kabbalis tic maxim that "through an action below, an action above is aroused,"265 and this applies equally to the holy and the demonic spheres. In contrast to the Eden Myth, sin arouses the cosmic serpent. The third step is the abandonment of the Shekhinah by Tiferet, which sets the stage for the attack of the Temurot. R. David reads this cosmic drama into and out of the passage in Deuteronomy concerning the wife who is suspected of being unfaithful. "'And he brings out an evil name (shem rac) upon her.' (Deut. 22:14). This means, as if it were possible, that He (Tiferet) brings out an evil name (shem rac)rac) upon Her (Malkhut). Don't read (the words as&gt;)shemrac but, rather,saw rac, i.e. the deadly poison of the Temurot which they inject into Her through the walls. For a man never leaves his house until people start slandering his wife. Therefore, his leaving brought upon her shem/sam rac. Understand all this!"266 Tiferet Tiferet leaves because, due to human sin and the concomitant arousal of the evil forces, Malkhut, or Keneset Yisra^el, has already been tainted. Tiferet Tiferet cannot dwell in a place of impurity. By His removing Himself, however, the door is left wide open for the Temurot, and they defile the defenseless Queen. Under such circumstances, they gain control over the riches of emana tion. "The Outside Forces snatch and grab the flow on the paths (the other Sefirot) before it reaches the treasure house (Malkhut)."267 By supplanting Malkhut,Malkhut, the Temurot have gained total dominion. This is an extreme situation, however. Normally, the Temurot are not in control of Malkhut or Her Divine emanation. On the contrary, they are instruments used by Her to punish sinful souls. "Those souls that have been created in this world and have brought upon themselves expulsion to the world of the Temurot, are immediately cut off and expelled by the Expelling Power from one quality to the next until (the sinful soul (263) Hdd., 40,2; 77,17; 241,26.

(267) Ibid., 249, 15.</page><page sequence="42">170 DANIEL CHANAN MATT [42] reaches) Malkhut. From there, he is drawn outside until he receives his punishment."268 Here, Malkhut banishes the soul to the Temurot for purgatory. The realm of Evil is accorded its proper place in the Divine plan. At other times, however, as we have seen, the Demonic threatens to take over completely and rule the world. Apparently, R. David struggled with two different conceptions: 1) that God has created both Good and Evil (cf. Isa. 45:7) and uses them as instruments of reward and punishment; and 2) the more radical, Gnostic view that Good and Evil are two opposing principles battling for control of the cosmos.269 According to either scenario, Mai khutkhut is the key link with the world. In one, She plays the role of judge, parcelling out reward and punishment. In the other, She is the Kingdom over which the forces of Good and Evil contend. I.I. Sod Hamalbush The author of the Zohar develops the image of the haluqa, a garment woven for a righteous person out of the good deeds he has performed.270 This haluqa,This haluqa, or malbush, is kept in store for him, and when the person dies, he is clothed in the garment. Thus attired, he can enter paradise. R. David displays the malbush in a beautiful passage near the beginning of SMhZ. He certainly drew on the Zohar, but he expands the theme to include several other motifs. The biblical context he works with is the death of Aaron's two sons, referred to in the opening verses of Parashat3AhqreiMot. R. David elaborates on a line from the Tanhuma, which offers an explana tion for their mysterious death: Aaron's sons were killed "because they entered without (their priestly) garments . . . But the secret meaning is that Aaron's two sons were not fully (268) Ibid., 204, 1-3. Cf. 'Azriel's statement, quoted above, n. 249. R. David may be referring here to reincarnation, which, in the early history of Kabbalah, was seen as a punishment rather than a cosmic principle. See Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 129, n. 385; p. 130, n. 401. Cf. Mosheh de Leon, Shushan cEdut, p. 349; see, however, Scholem's remark there, n. 157. (269) See Hans Jonas, The Gnostic Religion (Boston, 1963), esp. pp. 206-37. The Zohar also presents these two opposing schemes; see Tishby, Mishnat Hazohar, Vol. 1, pp. 285-95. (270) See Zohar I 66a, 210a, 224a; cf. Sefer Hamishqal, p. 56. Scholem has traced the origins of this theme in his study "Levush Haneshamot Vehaluqa' Derabbanan," Tarbiz 24 ((1955): 290-306. The direct source for Mosheh de Leon was Nissim of Kairouan's collection of stories, Hibbur Yafeh min Hayeshucah. D.H. Baneth has identified a Moslem tradition which may represent the indirect source of R. Nissim's tale; see his "Haluqa Derabbanan, Hibbur Yafeh min Hayeshu'ah Umasoret 3Islamit," Tarbiz 25 (1956): 331-36. Scholem raises the possibility of older sources, citing parallels in Persian eschatology and also Máháyána Buddhism, where it is said of Buddha that upon reaching the state of Nirvana "he has, as it were, a special body created from his good deeds" ("Levush," p. 305).</page><page sequence="43">[43] DAVID BEN YEHUDAH HEHASID AND HIS BOOK OF MIRRORS 17 1 clothed with the supernal clothes.271 For every zaddiq has a certain garment which he will wear when he is released to his eternal home. Then he will find that garment prepared (for him) and will dress himself in it properly. However, if his deeds have not been per fected, and he is not worthy of that garment, then he will not find the garment prepared. That garment is woven from mizvot and acts of zedaqah and good deeds, as it is written: "And he donned zedaqah like a coat of mail" (Isa. 59:17). This garment is prepared only for him who is perfected below and has maintained the Image of the Chain of Being272 in this world by engendering new life. This means that he has a partner. Then, he is complete both above and below, and then, that garment is prepared for him as it should be. But if, as if it were possible, this garment is not prepared for him because he hasn't been perfected below, because he is not married, and he is blemished for he has not fulfilled the procreative com mand, then that garment is stripped off of him from above. Thus, Aaron's two sons entered without the garments, that is, the supernal garments, for they had not yet made themselves like their Creator,273 and yet they entered to perform the Divine Service. (271) Cf. Moshehde Leon's wording: עדין לא נשלם חלוקו של פלוני (Sefer Hamishqal, p. 56); see Scholem, "Levush," p. 303. (272) וקיים דמות השלשלת. The identical phrase appears in the contemporary work, "Sefer Tacame Hamizvot," by Yosef of Hamadan, p. 439: ויעשה בנים ויקיים דמות השלשלת. This same book contains the more general statement: וכשאדם מקיים המעוות נותן קיום לשלשלת הקדושה והטהורה (p. 294' and cf. pp. 152, 293). See Altmann, inKiryat Sefer 40 (1965): 274, n. 49; and Scholem, EinigeEinige kabbalistische Handschriften im Britischen Museum (Jerusalem, 1932), p. 17. Apparently, R. David borrowed the phrase from this source; see Matt, SMhZ, Introduction, p. 106, n. 190. Cp. Mosheh de Leon's phrase: ואינו משתדל לקיים הפרי. .. (Shushan cEdut, p. 354). The shalshelet is the Chain of the Sefirot. Yosef of Hamadan spells this out in another work, "Sefer Tashaq" (ed. Jeremy Zwelling, Ph.D. diss., Brandéis University, 1975), p. 52: עשר הספירות שהוא שלשלת הקדש. The full phrase appears elsewhere in the book (pp. 62, 72, 80): שלשלת הקדושה והטהורה. The author mentions that this designation is a Kabbalistic tradition (p. 62). For other references to the Sefirot as a chain, see SMhZ, 174,4-5 (from Abulafia's Shacar Harazim);Harazim); 197, 1; Sefer Hamishqal, pp. 102, 115; cf.Zohar II 136b; Shushan cEdut, p. 354; and Me'iribn Sahula'sBe'ur Leferush Haramban, p. 4c. See also Mosheh Idel, "Qeta'im loyedu'im mihibure R. Yosef haba mishushan habirah," (unpublished), p. 1, n. 6. See Arthur Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge, Mass., 1973), esp. pp. 67-98; and David Blumenthal, "Lovejoy's Great Chain of Being and the Medieval Jewish Tradition," (unpublished paper). As to דמות, cf. the Talmudic statement (B. T. Yevamot 63b): .. .כל מי שאיו עוסק בפריה ורביה כאילו ממעט הדמות. Cf. Zohar I 13a, III 217a. Cp. the statement by cEzra of Gerona: שלא להכרית ולמעט דמותו מו התמונה הכוללת כל התמונות, (Commentary to the Song of Songs [Altona, 1764], p. 14a); see above, n. 242. See also A. J. Heschel, Torah min Hashamayyim Ba'aspaqlaryah shel Hadorot, Vol. 1 (Jerusalem, 1962), pp. 220-23. (273) R. David uses this phrase elsewhere: SMhZ, 56,12; 237,4; 24M9■ The idea is a</page><page sequence="44">DANIEL CHANAN MATT [44] 172 Therefore, they were punished from above, as it is written: "Fire came forth from God and consumed them" (Lev. 10:2). This means the supernal Fire,Malkhut, who is called Fire, as it is written: "For the Lord your God is a consuming fire" (Deut. 4:24).274 R. David adopts the view that the malbush is woven out of good deeds. However, for him there is one deed, in particular, which is of cosmic significance. Only through joining another and engendering new life does one become all he can be. For in the act of sexual union one imitates the Divine union of Tiferet and the Shekhinah. In this way, the human being joins in the process of Creation and extends the Great Chain of Being. Kabbalistic version of imitatio dei. Here, the point is that the human being must imitate the unification of the Sefirot. Conversely, a person who is not married is only "half a body"; see SMhZ, 57, 25-26; Zohar III 57b (refering to Aaron's two sons), 7b, 296a Cidra Zuta). (274) SMhZ, 27, 30-28, 12.</page></plain_text>
