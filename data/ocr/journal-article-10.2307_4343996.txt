<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL WORLD 93 IN THE BEGINNING By W. K. C. GUTHRIE Professor of Ancient Philosophy and Master of Downing College, Cambridge LIKE other peoples at early stages of their development the Greeks began by explaining natural phenomena as the operations of anthropomorphic gods. Soon after 600 B. C., however, the ascendancy in Greece of philosophical and rational thinking was astonishingly rapid; men began to think of phe- nomena as the working out of impersonal forces, and belief in the caprice of the gods gave way to a search for general laws. With frequent reference to the original works, Professor Guthrie traces thc gradual course of this intellectual emancipation, stressing the continuity of development and the constant influence of surviving mythical concepts on the formation of philosophies. As is almost inevitably the case with studies of the past, this one has much to teach us today. "The Greeks," says the author, "can stand a closer inspection, and it is not necessary to cherish illusions in order to be con- vinced that the study of them is still worth while." In these highly original and learned chapters, he makes good this claim. 151 pages, $2.50 CONTENTS Preface. 1. Mother Earth. (I) The Myths. 2. Mother Earth. (II) The Sci- entific Approach. 3.

In this book, Professor Ullmann re-examines the concept of meaning from a linguistic point of view, and puts forward a definition which will provide a framework Important for descriptive and historical studies. He discusses a number of funda- mental problems arising in semantics, such as ambiguity, changes of books meaning, the structure of the vocabulary, and the general tendencies which govern the evolution of words. The original edition, which appeared six years ago, has been brought up to date by the inclusion of a new chapter ,outlining recent advances in the field as well as the development of the author's own ideas. $10.00 A Book of Contemplation by DAGOBERT D. RUNES This is a book of philosophy at work. The author's mind ranges freely and fearlessy over the main topics, tenets and taboos of our time-and, indeed, of all time that man has been ion earth. Connoisseurs of wit and irony will relish the Book of Contemplattion as a delightful and inex- haustible source of epigrammatic quotes. Deftly, and always succinctly, the author turns many or our most hallowed concepts and definitions inside out to discover the truth-or lack of truth-within. Most important, by this swift-paced criticism of our world of accepted appearances, he lays bare, in its breath-taking simplicity, the essence of righteousness which underlines the great religious and systems of thought, and on which the thoughtful modern man may base his own faith. The author is editor of such standard works as The Dictionary of Philosophy and Treasury of Philosophy. $3.00 Language as Choice and Chance by G. HERDAN The occasional statistical treatment of language data is not new, but until now no systematic arrangement of the relevant knowledge scattered in linguistic, philosophical, mathematical and engineering journals, has been attempted. Dr. Herdan, lecturer in Statistics at the University of Bristol, England, here aims at providing a systematic exposi,tion of the quantitative structure of language.

"Wheelock's chief appeal is its loci antiqui, actual sentences and often paragraphs from the ancients themselves in each lesson, with emphasis on Ciceronilan humanism ... Finally, it is the least expensive text available.''-Louis H. Feldman, CLASSICAL WEEKLY. "In my opinion, this book more nearly meets the serious need for a college elementary text than any which has seen the light so far, and, despite its unpretentious appearance, might well become the standard text wherever students of mature purpose wish to learn Latin. It outdistances its nearest competitor by far . . Robert J. Leslie, THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Complimentary Examination Copies Available to Instructors. Send For Yours Today! BARNES &amp; NOBLE, Inc.
