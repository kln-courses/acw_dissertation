<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Burkert. Greek Religion. Translated by John Raffan. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1985. Pp. 10 (unnumbered), 493. $30.00. Burkert, perhaps the most eminent living historian of ancient Greek religion, published in 1977 his Griechische Religion der archaischen und klassischen Epoche, now the standard book on the subject, encyclopedic in nature, well structured, and readable, all that the interested student and scholar wants to know about ancient Greek polytheism. He has drawn from recent archaeological discoveries and from ancient art but, as our picture of the religion of the ancient Greeks comes mostly from their literature, Burkert uses this literature for recon- structing what we can know about ancient Greek religion. Burkert is well aware that "An adequate account of Greek religion is nowadays an impossibility in more ways than one: the evidence is beyond the command of any one individual, methodology is hotly contested, and the subject itself is far from well defined" (p.7).</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 59 Despite his modest claims he brilliantly presents primary sources to survey "Prehistory and the Minoan-Mycenaean Age"; "Ritual and Sanctuary"; "The Gods"; "The Dead, Heroes, and Chthonic Gods"; "Polis and Polytheism"; "Mysteries and Asceticism"; and "Philosophical Religion", preceded by a sur- vey of the scholarship on the subject and a discussion of the sources and scope of the study, and documented by some 140 pages of notes and bibliography at the end of the book. Every conceivable aspect of ancient religion is discussed to some degree: cult places, rituals, symbols, sanctuaries, offerings, oracles, all the major divinities individually, burials, the afterlife, minor divinities, festival and religious calendars, oaths, initiations, mysteries, among others. Burkert notes that we are dealing with "a pantheon of anthropomorphic gods who speak and interact with one another in a human way, who love, feel anger, and suffer, and who are mutually related as husbands and wives, parents and children" (p. 182), who possess sexuality, are linked to specific domains and functions, who cannot give life but can destroy it. "Gods and men stand side by side, separated even by ritual, but still related to one another as type and antitype" (p. 188). The Olym- pian pantheon constitutes the most remarkable organized and orderly pantheon in ancient religion, with no priestly caste with a fixed tradition, no sacred scrip- tures, and no authoritative revelation in the form of a sacred book. Certainly Greek Religion stresses that "The most important evidence for Greek religion remains the literary evidence, especially as the Greeks founded such an eminently literary culture" (p. 4). This means the religious texts as we know them in the Veda, Avesta or the Torah are not found, but instead "practi- cally the whole of ancient poetry is our principal evidence for Greek religion" (ibid.). The crisp and readable translation of Greek Religion by John Raffan al- lows a much wider audience access to Burkert's excellent survey of what we can know when we examine the primary sources carefully and interpret them intelli- gently.
