Edited by H. Biezais. Pp. xxix+177, 4 black-and-white plates. (Scripta Instituti Donneriani Aboensis, X.) Stockholm: Almquist &amp; Wiksell International, 1979. N.p. Currently, studies of religious thought and behaviour, including studies of Christian theology, are being undertaken in an increasingly wide range of cultures and language. Investigations of ritual and myth have been altered radically within the last ten years by the theory that the content of rituals and many other constituents of culture, including art, can be analysed in such a way as to show that they have structure, and that this structure is significant in terms of the world view of the society under review, and is related to other structures of that society. So it is that a general theory of symbolism can be established to which specialist disciplines can contribute. The formal patterns of language, analysed by the socio-linguist in order to try to discover how speech transforms the experience of those who use it, are related by the psycho logist and anthropologist to the structure of social relationships uncovered by the sociologist. Interdisciplinary co-operation tries to discover patterns of continuity and discontinuity in the thought of the past and present. The result is an interest in a possible universal structure of thought common to mankind and an enormous bibliography on the analysis of the structure of symbolism. This book reflects both the present-day interest in the phenomenon of language, and also offers an example of the kind of co-operative thinking which is a comparatively recent development. It is in many respects a very modern book.</page><page sequence="2">680 REVIEWS The opening essay by H. Biezais 'Die Hauptprobleme der religiosen Symbolik' surveys in a short compass the wide range of controversial issues involved in the theoretical problem: the nature of symbolism, the origin and structure of symbols, their power to effect social change, etc. The essay by R. Holte 'Gottessymbol und soziale Struktur' is a quasi sociological study related to it. The following thirteen papers consider specific problems. The anthropological study of symbolism is repre sented by 'The traditional symbolism of the Sun Dance Lodge among the Wind River Shoshoni' (A. Hultkranz); 'The symbolism of liminality' (J. Pentikai'nen); 'Symbolism and magical acts' (S. Berjerke). Socio linguistic studies are found under the titles 'Literary symbols and religious beliefs' (S. Linner); On the semiotic function of cucurbits' (R. Norrman). The eight remaining papers deal with the history of religions. They are 'The veto on images and the aniconic God in Ancient Israel' (T. Mettinger); 'The symbol of the centre and its religious function in Islam' (J. Hjarpe); 'The role of the icon in Byzan tine piety' (L. Ryden); 'Nut—Himmelsgottin—Baumsgottin—Lebens geberin' (J. Bergman); 'Christ is the Mountain' (C. Hallencreutz); 'The symbolism of Mesopotamian cult images' (H. Rinngren); 'Man as symbol of God' (A. Hultgard); 'On the symbol concept of the Vedic ritualists' (A. Parpola). What gives the book its coherence is the apparent underlying acceptance of the universalist theory of symbolism, and its value and interest lies in the fact that it forms an excellent introduction to a subject of great complexity. All the papers are clearly written and each author provides after his essay a workmanlike bibliography of the most recent work in his area. Of interest to the theologian is the fact that it has the merit of showing how anthropologists and sociologists can relate the discoveries of their field-work to the traditional subject-matter of the history of religions. Nevertheless, a few negative reflections do occur as a result of witness ing such a cross-cultural pooling of thought. It raises the interesting question how far in the end separate disciplines can be integrated to a marked degree. For ultimately all evidence, whether anthropological or sociological is historical evidence and so becomes subject to the problems and difficulties found in studying history. This point is exemplified by the essay on the Sun Dance, where it is clear that the author has to make some estimate of the reliability of the evidence which he is being given by the tribal expert before he can draw any conclusions. Secondly, although it is impossible to know whether the general structural theory is correct or not, it is certainly possible to question the imprecision of the developmental sweeps of thinking which the use of it</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 681 encourages. This can be seen particularly when the problem of symbol ism is put into the context of art, especially that of early Christian art. There is not in the book any direct discussion of art as a symbolic system, but there is much reference made to it incidentally; and the way in which the general theory can affect specific questions may be illustrated by two papers, that on the God-symbol and social structure and that on man as the symbol of God, in which Judaism and Zoroas trianism are compared as aniconic religions. It is axiomatic in some expressions of the generalized theory of symbolization that in the so-called higher development of religion there is a tendency towards transcendence, from polytheism to monotheism, from gods to god. In the essay on the God-symbol transcendence is seen as reaching its term in ancient Israel, and Christianity is represented as a softening of the tendency, because of its doctrine of the incarnation; the theory is seen as demonstrated through art. It is argued that the transcendent element in Christianity is the reason for the lack of representation in the early period of God the Father as the first person of the Trinity. Pictures of Christ were legitimate because of the incar nation; but anthropomorphic representations of God the Father are considered to begin to all intents and purposes only in the twelfth century, and are to be linked to the softening of the idea of transcendence and to a tendency to anthropomorphize the first person of the Trinity because of the lively interest of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in man. The theory is undermined by the ancient evidence both literary and monumental. To begin with we know from literature that in the second century and to some extent in the third the description of God as Father did not signify the first person of the Trinity but the one Godhead who is the author of all that exists. It follows then that there could not be an artistic representation of the first person as such until the distinctions of the persons of the Godhead had been elaborated theologically. In fact as soon as this happened, the Father as first person was so portrayed in art and with no shrinking from anthropomorphic representation. We do not have to wait until the twelfth century. On a two-zone fourth-century frieze sarcophagus, formerly in the Lateran collection and now in the Vatican Museum, there are represented all three persons of the Τrinity portrayed as identical bearded men engaged in the task of creating man. (See Atlas of the Early Christian World, ed. F. van der Meer and C. Mohrmann, London, 1966, figs. 169 and 171.) The piece is post-Nicene in date and is thought to have come from the workshop which produced the Arch of Constantine. Nor is it unique: two more examples of the same scene have survived though they are in a more fragmentary condition. Whether the iconography of these</page><page sequence="4">682 REVIEWS sarcophagi is to be regarded as embodying an example of a general world change in man's religious sense one would not care to say. But what it does reflect in the primary instance is the development of ancient Christian thinking on the doctrine of God and its exposition at Nicaea. A second example of the difficulties involved in interpreting historical evidence in terms of generalized theories is to be found in the paper on man as the symbol of God. Here it is suggested, on the basis of the transcendence theory, that the theological reason for the Jewish prohibi tion against representations of God is to safeguard the transcendence of his nature. The author then goes on to consider whether the prohibition against making human figures may be due to the same reason. According to the book of Genesis man is the image of God and to make the figure of a man might be construed as an attempt to represent divinity and therefore to destroy the emphasis on transcendence. But the Genesis passage on man as the image of God is notoriously controversial. According to recent research it may well be that instead of attempting to stress God's transcendence it may rather have as its purpose a desire to counteract an overemphasis on it, and to bring to the Israelite mind a sense of God's immanence. (See J. Barr, 'The image of God in the Book of Genesis: a study of terminology', B.J.R.L. li (1968-9)). One final point of personal regret is that the author of the essay on the role of the icon in Byzantine piety did not produce a paper upon a subject to which he only alludes. His essay keeps the icon problem still within the usual context of the iconoclastic debate and is a good account of the status quo on the question. A very interesting study, which would perhaps further the question and illuminate the problem, might be to explore the material from a different angle and to investigate the relation ship of the symbolism of the Eucharist to the visual symbolism of the icon in the Byzantine period. Stress upon visual representation may have some connection with a changed understanding of the role of the Eucharist at the time. Sister Charles Murray Sister Charles Murray</page></plain_text>
