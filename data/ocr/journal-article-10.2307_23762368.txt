<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes German anthropologist arrested and deported by Mexican National Security GÖTTINGEN (mex). In September 1994 the German anthro pologist and mexicon editorial staff member Gunther Dietz, M.A. was arrested by the Mexican National Security Service while he was engaged in offîcially approved ethnographie fieldwork in Michoacan. In coordination with AIPIN, a United Nations-sponsored international agency of the indigenous press, the anthropologist and fellow of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation was conducting fieldwork for his doctoral thesis on community-based indigenous media initiatives among the P'urhepecha of Michoacan. At the same time he was directing undergraduate fieldwork training organized by the University of Hamburg. The arrest took place in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan, in the night of September 28 to 29, after several P'urhepecha communities had concluded their negotiations with the State government, an event covered by the P'urhepecha section of AIPIN. Dietz was arrested by eight heavily armed National Security agents and brought immediately to the Federal Min istry of the Interior in Mexico City, where he was kept an entire day without food and interrogated for about 14 hours in connection with an alleged international conspiracy of Ger man, Israeli and United States Citizens to "export" the Zapatista rébellion from Chiapas to Michoacan. Even after realizing their mistake, the high-ranking agents, who claimed their Orders came from the highest levels, persisted in cross-exam ining Dietz conceming not only his académie credentials and activities, but also those of other foreigners working in Mexico. Denied the right to obtain legal counsel, the German scholar was jailed for two days under unacceptable conditions and after the well-publicized intervention by AIPIN, the Mexican League for Human Rights, the Friedrich Ebert Foun dation and PEN International on his behalf he was summarily deported from Mexico, deprived of his personal documents and without having seen evidence of an officiai document of expulsion. Since returning to Germany, Dietz has attempted repeatedly to obtain an explanation from Mexican authorities for their government's behaviour and to be granted officiai permission to return to Michoacan to complete his fieldwork. T o this day neither the Ministry of the Interior nor the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been able or Willing to explain this incident. The Maya ruins of Peña Bianca, Guatemala GRAZ (Karl H. Mayer). Recently, Miguel Angel Ordóñez Gálvez, an employée of the Guatemalan Proyecto Nacional Tikal (PRONAT) of the Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH), who works at the camp of Lake Yaxha in the Peten of Guatemala, informed the Director of PRONAT, Oscar Quintana, of a probably unrecorded and unpublished archaeo logical site in the southeastem Peten, west of the Dolores Valley, close to the modern settlement of Las Nuevas Delicias, where he lived about twenty years ago. On March 16, 1994, Quintana and Ordóñez, accompanied by Karl Herbert Mayer of mexicon, visited this archaeological site in Order to ascertain if it is indeed an unknown Precolumbian settlement. The distance from Flores to Las Nuevas Delicias by car is</page><page sequence="2">m rjAu «*§j i5f Fig. 1. Fallen and standing stelae at Peña Blanca. approximately 75 km, using the Flores-Poptun road to Colpeten and then a small road along the Rio San Juan via El Consuelo to the village of Las Nuevas Delicias. From there it is possible to proceed further by car about 10 km. With local people as guides, the ruins were reached on foot, crossing the Rio Jutal, just north of the Rio Poxte. The first section of the hitherto unnamed ruins is located in a rather flat valley, covered at présent by maize fields and high forest. This section, provi sionally named the Valley Group, consists of many low and high mounds, walls, and a larger rectangular architectural complex originally composed of five major structures, erected on a high platform. No standing buildings were encountered. An interesting feature is the presence of several limestone stelae, some standing in situ, others lying complete or broken on the ground, some well dressed (Fig. 1 ), others of a crude and irregular shape. One of the standing monuments is 220 cm high, 83 cm wide, and 25 cm thick. None of the numerous monuments bears carvings. From a location where a series of stelae is found the geographical coordinates of the place were determined with a hand-held GPS navigator (Latitude 16° 28.015' N, Longitude 89° 37.367' W). South of the Valley Group is the second architectural group of the site, situated on top of the ridge of a high and steep hill. The hill features several retaining walls composed of flat limestone slabs. A brief survey of this Hill Group, which has a north-south axis, revealed approximately seven major structures, several in good condition with standing walls, intact vaults and roofs in place. The series of structures, erected on différent levels of the hill, was obviously damaged by looters in recent times. On the mmm mt Fig. 2.

Since its interior is rather small it is considered by local people to be a tomb. The interior of this building has a stepped vault in a good State of préservation (Fig. 2). A standing building to the north is 323 cm long, 155 cm wide, and 180 cm high. The best preserved standing building is in the center of the Hill Group, rests on a round platform and has two rooms arranged in tandem-form. It is 670 cm long, and 370 cm wide, with a simple moulding of 100 cm in height (Fig. 3). The door on the west side is 100 cm wide, and 200 cm high.

There are three identical Calendar Round dates (3 Ben 6 Zac), probably representing the Long Count date 9.18.17.1.13(810A.D.). When found, the monument, which typologically is more a wall tablet than a stela, was in excellent condition although broken into two pieces, the lower half still being in situ. Fig.2.

In the presence of Per Kâks, the director, and Steffan Brunius, the curator of the American Department of the Swedish muséum, the Precolumbian carving was officially returned to the Guatemalan authorities, and the Odyssey of the stolen panel ended in Guatemala City's National Museum, where both pieces of La Amelia Stela 1 are to be reunited. Blue Creek Jade Cache SAN ANTONIO (Thomas H. Guderjan). In July, a St. Mary's University and Maya Research Program team, directed by Thomas Guderjan, discovered an extraordinary ritual deposit in Structure 4, the southern structure on Blue Creek's Main Plaza. This building is 6 m in height and dates to the Late Classic period, AD 600-750.

The most spectacular discovery, though, was of 892 jade artifacts which are highly variable in forms and sizes. The most unique samples include a 10x4 cm, anthropo morphic, tubular bead and its model in miniature. Other anthropomorphic pendants include an Olmec-sty led head with a helmet and drilled mouth comers and an anthropomorphic pendant with tongue extended, a 12 cm ear fiare, several zoomorphic pendants, and a portrait carved in profile.
