<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARGHERITA LONG M alice@Doll: Konaka, Specialization, and the Virtual Feminine The postapocalyptic setting of Konaka Chiaki s script for the 2001 OVA series Malice@Doll offers a sharp critique of urban office life and the pornographic pleasures that are supposed to make it bearable for salarymen. The characters, who live in a massive, void-suspended office complex called an "Organ," are divided into "machines" with male names like "Todd," "Joe," and "Freddy," and "dolls" with female names like "Doris," "Heather," and "Misty." Although the female characters appear to be human, we learn that they are inorganic ro- bot-puppets created by humans to serve as prostitutes. In contrast, the male characters are not anthropomorphic. They have low-tech metal bodies suited to their functions as, for instance, janitors, mechanics, and solderers. Both dolls and machines are governed by the "Systems Administrator," Joe, and his police force, a band of "Leukocytes." That the police force is named for the white blood cell that attacks foreign bodies suggests that an overemphasis on protecting against computer viruses may have created an atmosphere so hos- tile to actual organic infections, mutations, and adaptations that human and other evolving life forms were supplanted altogether. The sense of sterility is compounded by the characters' names, which in their full form are e-mail ad- dresses: doris@doll, heather@doll, joe@administrator, todd@repairer, chuck@ OSE?</page><page sequence="2">solderer, devo@leukocyte. Upon meeting, characters recite the other s full e-mail name, as if running an identification program. "Kon. Nichi. Wa. Joe. Atto. Adomin." The greeting points to the inhumanity of a society in which functions, not relations, determine identity. Konaka underscores its sense- lessness by having dolls and machines continue to perform their jobs for hu- mans, a.k.a. "gods," even now that humans are extinct. The servile janitor goes on literally licking the floor day in and day out, though no one cares any longer about its cleanliness. Malice, the title character, goes streetwalking every day, though there are no longer any patrons to solicit. Konakas dystopia is thus different from other recent Japanese an- ime that explore human identity in the virtual age by invoking what Susan Napier, following Scott Bukatman, calls "terminal identity." If identity before the computer age implied both mind and body, "terminal identity" drops the body from the equation, replacing it with the a-materiality of cerebral free play at, and often, as a computer terminal. The result, as Napier reads it in various anime series from Space Battleship Yamato to Neon Genesis Evangelion, is a "terminal culture" that "fuses reality and fantasy into techno-surrealism" by calling the material world into question.1 While Napier argues that "ter- minal culture" is greeted with more anxiety in Japan than elsewhere, what is interesting about Konaka s Malice@Doll is that it denies the possibility of dis- embodied subjectivity from the outset. To have a mind one must also have an organic body, it implies. Conversely, being inorganic, Konakas automatons are also mindless, in the full sense of the word. And although machines and dolls are supposed to have been invented by humans as service robots, there is a strong sense in which they represent humanity's own fate. The story sug- gests that if men reduce themselves to systems administrators and conduct their relationships entirely on the Internet, according to computer protocols, they become little more than mechanized maintenance crews for an ironically named, because inorganic, "Organ." And if they spend their office days visit- ing porn sites and their nights visiting sex workers, the function of women in their society becomes equally bloodless. Malice, the title character, is defined as a provider of "fleeting relief from the reproductive urges" of her patrons.2 Konaka s story opens as Malice awakens from a dream to find her creaky doll body soft, warm, and capable of both crying and menstruating. Not only has she been made human, but the kiss that she is programmed to offer ev- eryone she meets (her mantra: "I am a doll. This is all I can do . . .") now has the power to awaken organic life in others. At the end of the film she es- capes from the Organ, floating off on angels wings in an elegant backstroke as the series theme song "Kiss Me Blind" swells in a chorus of redemption. 158 MARGHERITA LONG</page><page sequence="3">Viewers recognize the tune as one that Malice has been humming wordlessly all along. But when Malice@Doll was released in Japan in 2001, in the UK in 2003, and in North America in 2004, online reviews were often less apprecia- tive of the happy ending than confused by the failure of Konaka s script to answer a number of pressing questions.3 Why are Malice s dreams repeatedly visited by a "ghostly apparition of a small girl in Victorian Dress holding a white ball/pearl"?4 Why is Malice restored to a perfect human form, while those she kisses are transformed into grotesque hybrids of bone, claw, and feather? Why is she content to go on kissing, when other newly organic bod- ies waste no time intertwining in spectacular couplings of insatiable sexual union? Most of all, why is Malice s transformation seemingly brought about by a " Legend of the Overfiend-style rape by a multi- tentacled 'biomechanical creature"'?5 This essay attempts to answer these questions by reading Malice@Doll within the larger context of what I will call Konaka's "Alice" series, a collec- tion of scripts for anime, video games, and live-action films, all of which are more or less overt homages to Lewis Caxroïûs Alice s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel, Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871). First in the series is Alice 6, a TV movie Konaka wrote and produced with his brother in 1995, in which six Alices go down the rabbit hole instead of one. Then there is Alice in Cyberland, a 1997 bishõjo geemu (beautiful-girl game, with subsequent OVA series) that Konaka designed for Sony PlayStation in which characters named Arisu (Alice), Juri (Julie), and Reina are screen prox- ies through which girl players can romp around an Internet Wonderland that comes into being when, as in Carrolls story, everyday language and logic turn first absurd, then absurdly insightful. A year later the same three girl-game figures reappear in Serial Experiments Lain to teach Lain that the fantasy of uploading human consciousness into the Web is suicidal and that the rewards of virtual reality are better reaped in girl-space rather than cyberspace. In the 1998-99 anime series Fushigi mahõ fuan fuan frãmashii (Mysterious witchcraft fun fun pharmacy), Carroll's Through the Looking Glass is reenacted by a girl who navigates a chessboard called "niko niko shõtengai" (smiley shopping court) to learn from a Chinese herbal medicine-selling Red Queen that all girls have the power to practice magic. Finally, in 2001's Malice@Doll, the ob- vious link to Carroll is the looking glass itself, with the title character Malice able to exceed her inorganic identity only by escaping her prostitute's sleep- ing dais, which is surrounded by mirrors. What links all the scripts in the Alice series is the premise that the vir- tual world is not a future utopia on the other side of a computer screen but MALICE @ DOLL J59</page><page sequence="4">an unrealized aspect of the present. This is a different concept of the virtual than what we find alternately celebrated and feared in the cyberspaces cre- ated by means of what Napier calls animes unique freedom from "the obliga- tion to represent the real."6 For Konaka, the real, in all its organic specificity, is the source of freedom and possibility; the direction of progress is toward embodiment rather than away. What makes Konakas Alice figures signifi- cant in this respect is their ability to tap into energies of relating and renew- ing that are latent, his scripts imply, in the bodies of all prepubescent girls.

Yet recognizing it as such does not mean giving up on the concept of the virtual altogether. In fact, the feminist philosopher Elizabeth Grosz has written of the virtual in language remarkably similar to that used by Konaka to describe his interests and mo- tivations. For both thinkers, the history of the virtual is much older than the history of "virtual reality," since it is simultaneous with the history of the present. As Grosz writes, The virtual reality of computer space is fundamentally no different from the virtual reality of writing, reading, drawing, or even thinking: the virtual is the space of emergence of the new, the unthought, the unrealized, which at every moment loads the presence of the present with supplementarity, re- doubling a world though parallel universes, universes that might have been.8 Now, here is Konaka in a 1999 interview with the anime journalist Nakajima Shinsuke: Whether I'm writing a scenario or a novel, I'm really only interested in 160 MARGHERITA LONG</page><page sequence="5">situations in which something extraordinary emerges from the ordinary. . . . I am never drawn to writing scripts that involve swords or magic, the distant past or the extreme future. What I like to write about are other worlds that invade this one, or even just establish one tiny point of contact, only to have it turn out that the two worlds were already completely entangled.9 For a close reading of Malice@Doll, it is essential to start with this idea of a "tiny point of contact" where the actual and the virtual open onto each other to load the present, as Grosz says, with supplementarity. For this tiny point of contact turns out to have a visual component in the white pearl carried by the mysterious Victorian girl through all the most "loaded" scenes in the film. We know the pearl is important because it bounces emphatically across an empty black screen twice in the opening scene. Malice shudders in her sleep, experiencing what, by the end of the film, we realize is a recurring dream composed of two competing story lines. In the first, she is being led by the Victorian girl with blonde hair and blue eyes (Carrolls Alice?) to a place in the Organ she has never seen before. This newly discovered place, a spherically shaped "ballroom," houses a red sun-and-moon-composite globoid called a "Vessel." Although it is the Vessel that ostensibly rapes Malice in the opening dream, it is also the Vessel that (after morphing briefly into a rabbit - more Carroll?) lovingly envelops Malice in the closing scene, dissolving upward in glimmering shards of light as she curls into the fetal position within. In the second story line of the recurring dream, Malice is being led by her own memories to scenes of servicing the "gods" before they went extinct. Split- second staccato flashbacks show her on her round bed/dais, with men licking the balls of her feet, gagging her with a rubber ball, and gripping her bulbous naked breasts as if they were baseballs. The two story lines, one ultimately redemptive and virtual, the other depressing and actual, seem to have noth- ing in common save the pearl, which sometimes bounces between them on its own and other times is carried, glowing and basketball-sized, by the Victo- rian girl. Yet one important visual connection is that both stories are told in the language of spheres and discs: the virtual world has its ballroom and its globoid Vessel, the actual world its sexualized balls of doll-flesh and rubber, and disc-shaped bed-dais. While the glowing pearl is the tiny spherical point that brings the two larger spheres into contact, two other equally spherical clues suggest that the ability to pass from one to the other is related to the problem of reflectivity. First is a conceptual drawing, absent from the film but adorning the cover of the DVD box, showing Malice inside the pearl, studying its surface with both MALICE @ DOLL Id</page><page sequence="6">her eyes and her fingers (Figure 1). Second are the opening stage directions in Konakas script, setting up Malice s initial dream by referencing a story by Edogawa Ranpo, the father of Japanese mystery and horror fiction: Scene i. Indoors. Dark. Malices bedroom. Spending even one night here would drive any normal human insane. Lenses and pieces of metal are scattered in little junk heaps here and there, as if the place had been designed by the protagonist of Kagami jigoku.10 figure i. Malice inside the Pearl. M alice@Doll, dir. Motonaga Keitarõ (2001). Edogawa wrote Kagami jigoku, "Hell of Mirrors," in 1929. It tells the story of a young man who has himself encased in a glass sphere, the out- side of which is painted with mercury to make the inside a perfectly round mirror reflecting him in every direction. In this way, the man becomes the first person in human history to experience the sight of infinite 360-degree self- reflectivity. The encounter drives him insane, and the story ends when his servants shatter the glass and he stumbles out a madman.11 In Malices bedroom, Ranpos mirror-globe is ap- proximated by the full-length mirrors that sur- round her bed-dais (Figures 2 and 3). It is to the dais and its mirrors that Malice retreats when her new human identity is rejected by her fel- low dolls and machines. "Who am I?" she asks. "What do I want?" Eventually, the inner safety of the nonreflective pearl will allow her to an- swer these questions in a new way. For most of the film, however, she suffers mightily inside her own hell of mirrors, her identity crisis precipitated by memories that reflect her doll identity from every excruciating angle. The most vivid such memory shows Malice revisiting the scene of her origin. In an old-fashioned workshop, doll appendages and doll torsos lie in various stages of assemblage, their porcelain skin as yet unpainted (Figure 4). Drawing close to one of the mannequins, Malice sees it open its eyes and realizes that it is she herself. As if in acquiescence, she slowly utters her man- tra, "Atashi wa, dõru." Then the scene shifts to the bedroom with the dais. A series of overbearing male silhouettes flash quickly by, as if lit by a strobe. One binds Malice in leather straps and gags her with the black rubber ball. 162 MARGHERITA LONG</page><page sequence="7">ы figures 2 and з. Mirrors flanking Malice's bed.

One kneels at her feet, rubs his cheeks against her stockings, and licks the enamel of her high heels. One is held close to her breast, "exactly as if she were the Virgin Mary."12 In the final flashback, a man slices deep into her cheek with a knife, but finds the interior bloodless. Watching and remembering all this, Malice begins to cry. Crying, she worries that her doll body, which is not supposed to cry, must be irreparably damaged. Clearly, however, what is damaged is not Malice but the society that manufactured her to cater to male desires like these. To Japanese viewers, Malices repertoire - sadist, masochist, goddess, beast - would be familiar from the street advertisements for mens sexual entertainment that one finds scattered in phone booths and train stations in every major urban cen- ter. Though fads may change, patronage remains steady, as does its cultural representation in manga, anime, sports newspapers, and late-night televi- sion. Taken as a whole, however, there is nothing particularly Japanese about this sexual repertoire or its familiarity. Malice is the same "eternal woman" we know well from Sigmund Freud: at once exalted and debased, sacred and profane, prostitute and mother. In three essays called "Contributions to the Psychology of Love" from 1910, 1912, and 1918, Freud relates the apparently contradictory desires of patients who want their women to be both chaste 164 MARGHERITA LONG</page><page sequence="9">and promiscuous, and who, satisfied by neither, are compelled to seek an endless series of affairs. Yet Freud explains that such desires are neither con- tradictory nor pathological. They are normal and universal, he says, for the simple reason that a man models all his love objects on his mother: If we survey the different features of the fantasized woman, it will hardly seem probable that they should all be derived from a single source. Yet psy- choanalytic exploration into the life-histories of men has no difficulty in showing that [they] are derived from the infantile fixation of tender feelings on the mother.13 According to Freud, a man overvalues his love object because his original ob- ject, his mother, is unique and irreplaceable. He thinks of his love object as a prostitute because his mother too betrayed him by sleeping with his father and was thus little different from a whore. A man debases his love object because it is only by doing so that he can bring his affectionate currents, for his exalted mother, in line with his passionate currents, for the whore he wants to steal from his father. Finally, a man spends his life chasing an end- less series of this same love object because the prohibition of actual incest with his _ _ _ _ , .

Wanting prostitutes, they visit not only Malice but a whole cadre of "dolls," insatiably, endlessly, until they drive themselves to extinction. If spending "even one night" in Malice s mirrored bedroom is enough to drive her insane, is it not because she is forced to contemplate herself pre- cisely as the woman her patrons desire? Konakas mirror scenes can be read as vivid literalizations of the metaphor of specularization that the feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray uses to describe both the accuracy, and the trag- edy, of Freud s account. For it is not just that male subjectivity is founded on the prohibition of the mothers body. Rather, it is founded on the substitu- tion of her body, her wondrous life-giving force, for this tiresome series of bloodless substitutes that Kanaka captures so well in his collection of doll personae: Heather, the innocent virgin; Misty, the S-M queen; Amanda, the MALICE @ DOLL 165</page><page sequence="10">impossibly large-breasted Amazonian matron. Is this really what men want? Is this who women are? lhe genius of Konakas "hell of mirrors" is the way it suggests not only that it is what men want but that what they want dic- tates who women are, female "identity" mirrored back as its perfect reflec- tion. Malice asks, "Who am I?" But all she can see when she imagines her origin is the doll factory, manufacturing her from the stock ingredients of overdetermined male fantasies. Irigaray calls the process "specularization" to take account of the way femininity is itself little more than a mirror of male desire.14 Her radical claim is that we will never know what femininity might actually be until we can escape this hell of mirrors known as oedipal subjectivity. Glossing Irigaray, Grosz proposes that femininity belongs there- fore to the virtual rather than the actual: "Sexual difference is that which has yet to take place, and thus exists only in virtuality, in and through a future anterior."15 In Konakas parlance, what has yet to take place is precisely the "Alice" who remains offscreen for most of the film. She has yet to take place because she remains latent in Malice, in the "Bad Alice" who represents femi- ninity entirely co-opted by a "normal" male desire that Konaka shows to be unequivocally pathological. Does such a reading give Konaka too much credit? His account of specu- larity may have much in common with feminist accounts, but the fact re- mains that viewers can still come away from the film with comments like the one on the back of the ArtsMagic DVD box: "If you like hentai anime or good old fashioned tentacle sex, then this one is for you."16 How can we be sure that Malices rape by the biomechanical creature is not gratuitous sexual violence for the enjoyment of the hentai (pervert) set? First, we know that this creature represents the maternal body through the way it ultimately gestates Malice as she lies curled in a fetal position within a womblike chamber that will transport her to a different future (Fig- ure 5). But before it can transport her, Malice must encounter the creature as a horrific phallic monster, sending forth huge snakelike tentacles that impale her through the chest, then sprout smaller tentacles to violate all her orifices. Perhaps the point is exactly that this is "good old fashioned tentacle sex" but that we are not supposed to consume it uncritically. For what becomes clear when we read the scene in parallel with the strobe-lit scenes of Malice being violated by the "gods" is that this rape is a simultaneous enactment of all the separate indignities she suffers as a prostitute at the hands of her patrons. The way Konaka sets up the equivalence is perfect, since it shows that this "phallic mother" is itself a reflection of rapacious male behavior that, because of Japanese "decency" codes, is signified in manga and anime by way of a 166 MARGHERITA LONG</page><page sequence="11">figure 5. Malice in the fetal position. blank but hardly absent erect penis. The scene underscores the irony of it be- ing illegal to depict the instruments of rape as such but legal to depict them as "huge flexible organs with sharp snake-like heads" and attribute them to the maternal body! 17 This aspect of Konakas story is also classically psychoanalytic, in that Freud too posits the "phallic mother" as the omnipotent, yet-uncastrated be- ing with whom children imagine they were joined prior to the prohibition of the mothers body by the father.18 Again femininity is the victim of specu- larization, made to reflect back the default male organ rather than any of her own. But the point is that the phallic mother is not an anomaly invented either by Freud or by Konaka. She is simply another example of what Irigaray calls the "isomorphism" of a society in which everyone is defined in terms of the phallus. Konakas dystopia could hardly be a clearer illustration, peopled entirely by gods who wield the phallus, dolls who service it, and machines who keep the whole operation running. When Malice wants to access a different reality, loading this dystopia with supplementarity, her points of contact with its unrealized virtuality are dreams about her origin. She dreams first that if she is a doll, she must have come from a doll factory. As we have seen, this dream does not offer contact with a parallel universe because it is resolutely specular, keeping her trapped in the phallic actual. Next she dreams that if she is human, she must have MALICE @ DOLL 1$7</page><page sequence="12">come from a mother. This nightmare into the past is specular, too, at least ini- tially. She finds that even the maternal origin, source of all humanity, is de- fined solely in terms of phallic power. But in the climax of Malice@Doll, Malice dreams her way past the rapaciousness of the Vessel, dismantling it piece by piece until it begins to reassemble itself, miraculously, into a source of life and nurturing. Once it does so, she is able to sleep blissfully inside, dreaming for the first time without being reflected back to herself as the tired collection of phallic femininities that the film has presented so clearly: sadist, masoch- ist, virgin, and whore, all variations on "mother." Konaka ensures that these figures remain banished from Malice s future by staging the final dream as an encounter between Malice and an alter ego named "Naked Malice" whose body is represented only by the promise of glowing white light (Figure 6). "You have been dreaming that, in reality, dolls have bodies like this," she tells Malice, assuring her not only that dolls can dream but that in their dreams the shapes and abilities of their bodies are infinite.19 This gesture toward organic infinity is fleshed out, literally, in the figures of the other dolls and machines when Malice kisses them back to life. One by one they are transformed into spectacular hybrids of bone, claw, and feather, each more elaborate than the last, and each capable of even more sexual figure 6. Naked Malice. 168 MARGHERITA LONG</page><page sequence="13">pleasure. The point would seem to be less that they are grotesque than that they are unimaginably original and diverse. For it is significant that, in order to confront the Vessel, Malice must pass through a room that looks like a wildly disorganized museum of natural history strewn with bizarre skeletons and fossils of creatures that never existed. We recognize them as preserved versions of the living creatures that begin to slither all over the Organ as soon as Malice acquires her power to reorganicize. She mentions that no one in the Organ has ever seen this room. As she walks through it, we realize that her ability to access it is contingent upon her ability to dream herself back into history past the false barrier of the phallic mother. Doing so puts her in contact with an immense font of evolutionary creativity representing the infinity of alternate life forms that remained virtual so long as the history of the Organ was commensurate with the history of isomorphism. Though the creatures do indeed seem grotesque to our specularized eyes, Konaka sug- gests that, seen otherwise, they become not scary but fascinating in their endless variety. By its very nature, the virtual exceeds the actual in terms of the scale of latent differences. "Malice" carries the latency of girlhood, of "Alice," by virtue of her connection with the Victorian girl. This is why her reorganicization restores her to perfect female form. In contrast, the other dolls and machines carry different latencies, and different passions, far in excess of those of human women and men. This is one reason Malice is content to go on merely kissing while the others explore new forms of sexual expression. Yet in the end, Malice s kiss is significant less as a realization of her virtual than as one of the "tiny points of contact" already latent in the actual. Like Lewis Carroll, Konaka proposes that what a girl needs in order to access the virtual is not advanced technol- ogy but simply a dream. And, like dreaming, the other forms of technology he uses to load the present with supplementarity are almost as old as the human body itself: kisses and dolls.20 So it is significant that Malices man- tras invoke precisely these three elements. When we first hear her uttering them in her role as prostitute, they seem pathetically limited and limiting. But when Malice utters her mantras to those she is about to make organic, they become powerful to the degree that they pivot on the huge potential of her girl body: Atashi wa, döru. [I am a doll.] Kisu о shite ageru. [I'll give you a kiss.] Yume о mite ageru. [I'll dream you a dream.] Atashi ni wa, kore shika dekinai. [This is all I'm capable of doing.] MALICE @ DOLL f69</page><page sequence="14">The triumph of Malice@Doll is to show that all a doll is capable of doing is really quite immeasurable! Through dreams and kisses, Malice resuscitates entire millennia of organic variety that have been rendered unlivable by our porno-phallic reality. Still, should we be troubled that the film jumps so quickly from the sexual singularity of isomorphism to the infinity of nonsexually specific life forms, without first specifying what femininity would be like after the reign of the phallus? In other words, should we be satisfied to encounter virtual Malice only as the blank emptiness of white light? Feminists have posed similar questions of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze, whose admiration for Carrolls Alice in Wonderland is like Konakas in that he too uses the figure of the girl to contemplate a kind of difference not based on mirroring, doubling, bina- ries, or what Deleuze calls "major itarian" distinctions based on a privileged, original term. For Deleuze, Alice is an example of "infinite identity" - of "the paradox of pure becoming" - because her dream confounds the opposition between large and small bodies, forward and backward time, cold and hot weather, active and passive actions.21 And in Deleuzes philosophy, the sort of infinite identity Alice achieves is contingent on specifically feminine laten- cies: "All becomings begin with and pass through becoming- woman."22 Femi- nists have not tended to object to Deleuzes reasoning on this point. When he and Félix Guattari write that "the question is fundamentally that of the body . . . they steal from us in order to fabricate opposable organisms," point- ing out that "the body is stolen first from the little girl," they follow logic similar to that of Malice@Doll.23 In order to discover what our isomorphic system has foreclosed, we need to revisit the site of that foreclosure, that original "theft," be it the prepubescent girl or the phallic mother. What has drawn feminist concern is the speed with which Deleuze and Guattari move from the becoming-woman made possible by such revisits to other forms of becoming. As Grosz observes, If becoming- woman is the medium through which all becomings must pass, it is, however, only a provisional becoming or a stage in a trajectory or movement which takes as its end the most microscopic and fragmenting of processes, which they describe as "becoming imperceptible."24 The same charge might be levied against the way Konaka ends Malice@Doll, with both the girl/Malice and the mother/Vessel dissolving upward in glim- mering shards of molten light, their ethereality in stark contrast to the speci- ficity of the reorganicized dolls and machines that have begun squirming all 170 MARGHERITA LONG</page><page sequence="15">THE TRIUMPH OF MAUCeClbPOU- over the Organ. &amp; Is it not premature ť to -, , . &amp; ť IS TO SHOW -, , THAT ALL A VOLL IS . posit an infinite number of sexual identi- CAPAe(,g 0p ,5 RgAUy ties if we have only barely begun to speak QUITE IMMEASURABLE" of two? Does it not take more than ab- straction to establish the female half of '/ what Irigaray calls the "at least two" of meaningful sexual difference? The rush from "the one" to "the multiple" betrays its feminist impetus if the femi- nine is lost along the way. As if mindful of such concerns, Konaka makes "the multiple" vanish from the Organ as soon as virtual-Malice departs. In the final scene, after she and the Vessel have dissolved, Malice sprouts luminous wings and flies through the void surrounding the Organ, her song "Kiss Me Blind" filling the neigh- borhood of the remaining dolls' brothel. As they gather outside to watch and listen, we realize with a start that they have reverted to their original prosti- tute bodies and are quickly losing all memory of the gifts they received from Malice. One says she recognizes Malice's song but hates it. Others cannot see or hear Malice at all. In the absence of Malice's new nonphallic femininity, it seems the other dolls are destined to return to the status quo that their Systems Administrator Joe had defended throughout the film. Dismissing Malice's tears as "leaking coolant," he had intoned, "In this world there are no machines that are not broken. The thing to do is keep getting repaired and live forever."25 Overriding her alarm over the violence of the "gods," he had said, "It is not for dolls to hate the function that dolls were created to perform."26 Has Konaka taken his characters from "the one," to the feminine, to the mul- tiple, only to trap them back in the violent, broken monotony of the one? Yet just when the film's Utopian momentum seems lost, Malice swoops down from the heavens to bestow one final kiss on Joe. He had decided too late that he wanted to be kissed and had been left still wanting "to see what Malice sees" when she strode off to confront the biomechanical creature. When Joe finally receives his kiss, we realize that what he wants is to be "kissed blind" to the mandates of the system he has administered so reso- lutely until now. It seems like far less than what feminists worry Deleuze wants - multiplicity, imperceptibility, infinity. Yet perhaps it is also far more. If the rush from the one to the multiple renders the feminine and the mul- tiple untenable, then we will always be searching for new ways to load the present with the tiny point of contact that can open it to a different future. More than any result, it is this search that defines Konaka as a scriptwriter, just as it defines Joe. The parallel between the two men is made explicit in an interview included with the DVD, in which Konaka says his favorite Malice MALICE @ DOLL 171</page><page sequence="16">character is Joe. "As a man," he says, "I can't help being terribly moved by the final kiss between Joe and Malice." Rather than appropriate her feminine powers of becoming with a "Malice с est moi" approach, Konaka maintains a separate masculine role for himself. Through the tiny point of contact that is her kiss, he will continue to write a "blind" alternative to specularity, access- ing the virtual as a space for the emergence of the new. Notes 1.

The issue of realizing the virtual through older technologies is important to the story of the films own genesis. Although it was created almost entirely by computer graphics, Konaka and the director Motonaga explain in an interview included with the DVD that they emulated not the perfection of CGI but the spare, jerky look of 1980s Czechoslovakian stop-motion doll animators like Jan Svankmajer and Jiri Trnka. This is a vote in favor of the power of the material over the purely conceptual. And it reminds us that the plot of Malice, though based in a computerized office dystopia governed by things like e-mail protocols, features no computers whatsoever. Vicki Kirby has written that the "terminal" tends to act as a "prophylactic interface," keeping the messiness of materiality on one side of the screen while the virtual floats free on the other (Telling Flesh, 137). Kon- aka rejects this, just like Carroll rejects it, by insisting on having his heroine go through the looking glass. When there is no "terminal," there is no barrier to the past, so the virtual can be accessed in all its material complexity. 21. Gilles Deleuze, The Logic of Sense, trans. Mark Lester, ed.
