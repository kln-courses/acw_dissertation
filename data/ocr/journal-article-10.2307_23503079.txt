<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION FRANK TALMAGE University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada DAVID Kimhi's journey to Spain in the winter of 12321 to plead the cause of the Maimonists was motivated by more than a desire of a disciple to defend the honor of his master. What was at stake for Kimhi, and indeed for all Jewish "rationalists" who took part in the controversies of the early thirteenth century, was a con ception of Jewish learning which had been promulgated for three 1 Cf. N. Brùll, "Die Polemik fur und gegen Maimuni im 13ten Jahrhunderte," JahrbiicherJahrbiicher fiir Jiidische Geschichte und Literatur 4 (1879), pp. 1-35; J.

Silver, MaimonideanMaimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy 1180-1240 (Leiden, 1965), pp. 175 ff., et passim. This episode has been treated in the above works and needs no elaboration here. However, the following points may be noted: (1) The correspondence between Kimhi and Judah Alfakhar has not been entirely printed in its proper order in the Qovez teshuvoth ha-RaMBaM we-iggerothaw (Leipzig, 1859) as can be seen from the contents. Thus Kimhi's third letter is printed before Alfakhar's second letter. The proper order is as follows: (1) The first letter of Kimhi (1c); (2-3) the first and second letters of Alfakhar (1c-3b, 4a~4b); (4) the second letter of Kimhi (4b~4c) ; (5) the third letter of Alfakhar (4c~4d) ; (6) the third letter of Kimlii (3b~4a). (2) Baer conjectures that the reading ברנגש in the letter of Joseph ben Todros (Jeshurun(Jeshurun 8, [1869], p. 45), is to be altogether rejected and that the entire incident involving Joseph ben Todros took place in Toledo (Toledoth, p. 484, n. 59). There is nothing concrete on which to base the assumption that Kimhi did indeed reach the latter city. Further, if Joseph ben Todros were in Toledo, he would not have found it necessary to communicate with Alfakhar by letter. While the sequence of events is unclear, Kimhi most probably entered Burgos on the way to Toledo and was ex pelled from the city. He then fell ill in Avila and upon his recovery returned by way of Burgos (since Joseph ben Todros had by then repented of his harshness). (3) D. J. Silver doubts the validity of Kimhi's testimony that R. Solomon ben Abraham and his disciples, R. David ben Saul and R. Jonah ben Abraham Gerondi, were the ones who betrayed the Guide to the ecclesiastical authorities on the basis of lack of confirmation in the other sources, especially the chronicle of the Bene Hisdai (Maimonidean Criticism, p. 153). While it is true that Kimlji's charge is not confirmed, neither is it expressly refuted in the other reports. Cf. my remarks in "Heresy in Judaism: Two New Examinations," Judaism 16 (1967); Baer is correct in his view that on the basis of the available evidence, absolute certainty in the matter cannot be attained (Toledoth, pp. 484 f., n. 60).</page><page sequence="2">[2] 178 FRANK TALMAGE centuries. This tradition maintained that it was not only proper to concern oneself with secular sciences, but that it was a necessary and integral part of divine service. This attitude was shared by such figures as Sabbetai Donnolo,2 Abraham ibn Ezra,3 Abraham bar Hiyya,4 and its most eloquent spokesman, Moses Maimonides. The latter informed his readers: It is our duty to love and fear the honored and revered God . . . and what is the way that will lead to the love of Him and the fear of Him? When a person contemplates His great and wondrous works and creatures and from them obtains a glimpse of His wisdom which is incomparable and infinite, he will straightway love Him, praise Him, glorify Him, and long with an exceeding longing to know His great name.5 This basic theme, that in order to praise and fear God, one must know His works and that His works are known only through a knowl edge of the sciences, is frequently reiterated in Kimhi's writings. In commenting on the verse "Everyone that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him {yezartiw),{yezartiw), yea, I have made him ('asithiw)" (Isa. 43:7), Kimhi remarked : for they [Israel] recognize and know that God created them and ... the world and are witnesses thereof for they were created for God's glory. They confess [His existence] and declare that God formed man . . . Now the term yezirah refers to the formation of his limbs [and] 'asiyah to the provision of his nourishment and his physical needs . . . Thus must one meditate on man's creation — how his limbs were formed in wisdom — and how his sustenance was provided from the day he was born, for this wisdom brings man to recognize God. Consideration of each limb reveals "the wonders of the Creator" since "every single limb is created with wisdom and the understanding that it is for a need and a purpose."6 For Kimhi, as for Maimonides, to study the creation (ma'aseh bereshith) is to study natural science (hokhmath ha-teva'),7 be it 2 Introduction to Hakhetnoni.Hakhetnoni. 33 Yesod mora I; Shorter Commentary to Exod. 20:9; cf.

Our author's interest in philosophical and scientific literature becomes apparent upon reading his commentaries. He was acquainted with every major rationalist work from the geonic period on. Kimhi, who did not read Arabic fluently, had access to both the works of Ibn Ezra and Bar Hiyya in the original Hebrew and the Hebrew translations of Arabic works done by his father, Joseph Kimfii, Judah and Samuel ibn Tibbon, Abraham ibn Hasdai, and others.10 Indeed, it was David Kimhi who commissioned Ibn Hasdai to translate the Book Book of Elements of Isaac Israeli." Yet although Kimhi was profoundly interested in philosophical literature, he cannot at all be considered an independent philosopher. One cannot speak of a Kimhian "system" nor can one find in his writings an instance of a fully developed treatment of a philosophical topic. Kimhi's ideas on any one subject must be pieced together from remarks scattered throughout his commentaries. The results of such a synthesis indicate first that Kimhi dealt with topics current in philosophical literature when they were relevant to his explication of Scripture. He would draw on such material for illumination when a question concerning prophecy, divine providence, or a similar topic would arise. An analysis of Kimhi's views on these topics indicates further that they contain very little original material. His statements concerning prophecy and providence are almost exclusively Maimonidean, while his epistemology and treatment of the biblical precepts rely heavily on Saadia and Ibn Ezra. His contribution lay not in his original ideas (although, to be sure, one occasionally finds a novel approach or reaction to a problem) but in his modification of the old, and his adaption of them to their new context. Maimonides' lengthy discussion of the levels of prophecy, unsuitable for a biblical commentary, was briefly summarized by Kimhi, and the eleven levels of Maimonides were reduced to five. Kimhi's discussion of providence omits any mention of the problem of God's knowledge upon which all discussion of providence depends. Much technical terminology also, such as actuality and potentiality, Active Intellect, and so forth, is absent from the general commentaries. All of this is put into sharper per 8 Isa. 5:12. י Ps. 8:5; cf. Ps. m:10. 10 Cf. Twersky, Rabad of Posquiires (Cambridge, Mass., 1962), pp. 260 f. " Cf. Sefer ha-yesodoth (ed. S.

Into those two tracts, Kimhi compressed all he could of current philosophic conceptions and terms to the complete obfuscation of the biblical text. These latter com mentaries, however, were intended for the elite, for those learned in philosophy. This was decidedly not the case with the general commen taries, which proved inadequate for those who sought the mysteries of Aristotle in the Bible. Rather, Kimfii's function in incorporating scientific and philo sophical matters in his general commentary was to introduce the wider public to the study of science, to disseminate philosophical knowledge in a simplified form, and to win converts to rationalism. To judge Kimhi's relation to philosophy by his philosophical commentaries on Genesis and Ezekiel is to distort the truth, for his guiding principle throughout most of his writings was moderation. Just as Maimonides had stressed that the initiate must delay the study of metaphysics until he is sufficiently mature to withstand the impact of philosophical thinking,12 Kimhi observed: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov. 1:7). 1:7). The fear of the Lord is the Torah, the commandments, the words of the prophets, and the tradition of the sages in the Oral Law, and "wisdom" is the wisdom of philosophy. If one studies philosophy first, he will become confused . . . Then he will presume to deny the great portents and miracles. . . not to speak of. . . the Torah and the commandments which are based on reason. Indeed, the statutes which are said not to have a reason only have none which is apparent to most people, but the sage who considers will find a clear and explicit reason . . . if one, however, studies philosophy afterwards he will not be come confused,13 because "he has already fixed a peg in a sure place."14 Kimhi emphasized that the child must be nurtured on tradition {qabbalah){qabbalah) until he can understand the principles of God's divinity by himself. "Know the God of your father, i. e., let him rely on tradition until he can know Him by himself."15 Kimhi's entire method was in accordance with the principle that the initiate should be gradually introduced to the study of philosophy. He was interested in encouraging and stimulating rather than in 12 12 Guide 1:34 f.; cf. Hilkhoth yesode ha-torah 11:12; IV:10. 13 Introduction to Joshua. 14 Ps. in:10; cf.

By introducing philosophical themes in appropriate places throughout the commentaries, Kimhi could prove the extreme relevance of philosophy to biblical study. By citing a philosophical interpretation of a midrash in the style of Maimonides, Kimhi could show that a knowledge of philosophy was indispensable to a full knowledge of rabbinic literature, and that indeed the sages themselves were philosophers.16 Kimhi could therefore reach many who would never pick up the Guide,Guide, or the Ma'amar yiqqawu ha-mayim or a similar work. He had indeed a captive audience, for those who came to benefit from his exegesis had to remain and listen to the rationalist propagandizing also. In the following pages, we propose to present an analysis of the philosophical topics treated by Kimhi in his commentaries, which will be discussed under the following headings: (a) theory of knowledge; (b) prophecy; (c) providence; (d) the law and ta'ame ha-mizwoth; (e) philosophical interpretation of Scripture. (a) Theory of Knowledge The first formal discussion of epistemology in medieval Jewish literature is found in the writings of R. Saadia Gaon who delineated three sources of knowledge: a) sense perception, b) reason (intuitive knowledge), and c) knowledge acquired by inference, to which "we, the congregation of monotheists . . ., add a fourth which we have derived from the other sources, namely reliable tradition."17 After Saadia, a fourfold division became conventional. Joseph ibn Zaddik, for example, distinguished a) the perceptions of the senses, b) truths admitted by reason or self-evidence, c) tradition, and d) first principles or axioms.18 However, this division, which was adopted by Maimonides,19 does not correspond exactly to that of Saadia in that these four fell into the category of necessary or imme diate knowledge, while in Saadia's system only the first, second, and 16 The theory that Greek wisdom was originally the creation of the Jews found frequent expression in the literature of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. For a list of citations on this subject, cf. I. Zinberg, Toledoth sifruth yisra'el (Tel-Aviv, 1958) II, pp. 394-398. *1'Emunoth^'Emunoth we-de'oth (Warsaw, 1913), introd., pp. 43 f. Saadia wrote several variants to this scheme. See I. Efros, "Saadia's Theory of Knowledge," JQR N.S. 33 (1942-3), pp. 133 f., 167. The inclusion of tradition was borrowed from the Mutakal limun, who in turn received it from the Greek commentators of Aristotle through the Syriac writers. See Efros, JQR 33, pp. 159 f. 18 'Olam qatan (Breslau, 1903), pp. 3 ff. 1י Milloth ha-higgayon VIII; Shemonah peraqim VI.</page><page sequence="6">[6] 182 FRANK TALMAGE fourth elements belong to this class. Saadia's "inferential knowledge" belongs to the category of demonstrated or mediate knowledge. On the other hand, the second and fourth elements of Ibn Zaddik's classification would presumably be included in the inferential knowl edge of Saadia.20 Following his father, Kimhi outlined his classification of knowledge in connection with Prov. 9:1, "Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn out her seven pillars."21 According to the Kimhis, these seven pillars were a) the five senses, b) true reports (haggadah), and c) proof and knowledge of the intellect (ra'yath ha-sekhel wi-di'atho). In addition to these three classes of hokhmah, R. David added the eighth way, that of tradition, in which we must all necessarily believe. Through it, the fact that Moses wrote the Torah at God's word, the creation of the world, the stories of the patriarchs, the great portents which our fathers saw in Egypt or in the desert, the splitting of the sea and the Jordan, the assembly at Mount Sinai, the halting of the sun and the moon for Joshua, and the rest of the wonders recorded by the prophets, which our eyes did not see and our ears did not hear and which are not recog nized nor examinable by the intellect, are all verified and affirmed within us. The reports of the maggidim are indeed verifiable but this is not. It is rather to be affirmed from books which are a legacy from generation to generation. It is confirmed with us and fixed in our hearts, as if our eyes saw, our ears heard, our intellects recognized, etc., for sometimes the senses deceive and the intellect errs when proofs are not certain. Tradition, however, is a legacy from generation to generation and has not been denied by a member of any nation; nor do any of the books contradict [each other] concerning it. Therefore tradition is as certain with us as the intellect.22 In effect, then, we meet once again with a fourfold classification, and we may examine how it relates to those which came before it. To begin with the third element, we note that reason or intellect apparently includes both mediate (re'ayah) and immediate (yedi'ah) knowledge, thereby reconciling the classifications of Saadia and Ibn Zaddik. In this connection, we may note that Saadia himself, in a secondary classification of the sources of knowledge in the Tafsïr Mishle, used reason Çaql) in this twofold sense.23 Furthermore, in this 10 Ibn Zaddik himself reduced these two to one basic category.

Tafsir Mishle, pp. 126 f.</page><page sequence="7">[7] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 183 same classification, Saadia distinguished between Scripture (maktûb) and tradition (manqûl) as sources of knowledge.24 Kimhi's statement that tradition "is to be affirmed from books which are a legacy from generation to generation" indicates that he included Scripture in the category of tradition. Let us now return to the first two categories of Kimfii's classifica tion, sensory perception and haggadah. Citing Ibn Gabirol, Kimhi stated that sensory knowledge refers to the "five senses to which man's qualities (middoth) are related." To this, however, Kimhi added that which [Ibn Gabirol] did not mention, namely, the relation of the senses to the learning process (darkhe ha-hokhmah) . . . with the eyes one sees scholarly literature, with the ears one hears from the mouth of scholars, and with the mouth one recites what one has learned and teaches others, and with the hands one writes books. The sense of smell must be explained. It is related to wisdom since the nostrils are proximate to the two foremost cerebral chambers in which the imaginary faculty is situated.25 In this discussion, the reference to the relation between the nose and the imagination is forced and incidental. The stress is on the reception of knowledge from teachers and books. This new interpréta tion of sensory perception does not appear to have a Vorlage in previous classifications. However, a look at Saadia's secondary classification in the Tafslr Mishle might prove useful in this context. There, Saadia listed, in addition to sensory perception, reason, Scripture, and tradition, a fifth element, istinbât. Efros has indicated that in this passage istinbât is equated with taljrir (Hebrew equivalent: diqduq) and refers to an "accurate study of a text."26 It is this tradition which Kimhi may have had in mind in his inclusion of this category in his classification. The second element of the classification, haggadath ha-maggidim, the discourse of reporters, is more difficult to trace. We do not know [this category] through the senses but it is certain . . . The reporters say that Constantinople is in the world and if one never went there nor ever saw it, he can be assured that it is there since everyone who was there reports it and no one denies it. The reports are also necessary in science for the ways of science are revealed in the examination of creation and not known to everyone. They can be known through reporters however . . .27 24 Cf. 'Emunoth IV:128; V:147; VII.165, 171.

Ezek. 1:1.</page><page sequence="8">184 FRANK TALMAGE [8] The term haggadah was used by Ibn Tibbon for Saadia's khabr (taken in the sense of tradition) in the ' Emunoth.29 Similarly the term maggidimmaggidim was used both by Ibn Janah29 and Maimonides30 in the sense of "transmitters of tradition." Kimhi, on the other hand, apparently distinguished between haggadah and tradition (qabbalah). While qabbalah refers to the sacred and the historical, haggadah refers to the secular and the scientific. The former is no longer verifiable, but the latter is. (The phrase "we do not know haggadah through the senses" does not refer to the possibility of verification but its prac ticability.)ticability.) Haggadah is in effect sensory knowledge and conclusions based upon it at second hand.31 An examination of the order in which Kimhi listed his four cate gories of knowledge indicates that they are listed according to priority of substance, i. e., epistemological indispensability, just as in Saadia's listings.32 Thus sensory perception is considered prior to reason and tradition as in other systems, and haggadah, as second-hand sensory knowledge, is coupled with it. Of course, Kimhi's second interpretation of sensory perception as reception of knowledge from books and teachers should logically come after qabbalah as in Saadia. Again as in Saadia and others, the priority in rank of reason over sense perception is established. Thus we are told that the Messiah "will be served by the intellectual (sikhliyyoth) rather than the sensible (hushiyy oth). "33 aS See note 17. " Riqmah (ed. M. Wilensky, Berlin, 1929), p. 28. 3"Hil.3"Hil.3"Hil. Tesh. 111:8.30 Hil. Tesh. 111:8. 31 At Isa. 40:21, Kimfii uses the expression ha-maggidim derekh qabbalah combin ing the two concepts. Under discussion is the question of knowing God through contemplation of His handiwork. The inclusion of the two elements of book learning and haggadah is particularly significant in the context of Kimlji's literary activity and in the light of his role as a popularizer. Kimlji laid great stress on the duty of transmitting knowledge through the compilation of books, his goal being the inclusion of as much knowledge — exegetical, homiletic, scientific, etc. — as was convenient for the benefit of laymen, 1. 1. e., for those who could not do independent investigation or have access to source materials. (On this aspect of Kimhi's literary activity, see Talmage, Study, pp. 26 ff.) This "encyclopedic" approach in general was censured by such writers as Joseph ibn Caspi who condemned those who drew from the works of others and incorporated such material in their own writings (cf. 'Asarah kele kesej [ed. Last, Pressburg, 19°31ל pb I, pp. I, 8, 85, 183; pt. II, pp. 31. 46). Kimhi's stress on haggadah might have been in defense of his right to borrow material and in refutation of Ibn Caspi's principle that only the publication of original material is to be considered legitimate. 3232 Efros, JQR, N.S. 33, pp. 166 ff. 33 Gen. 49:12; Efros, JQR, N.S. 33, pp. 166ff.</page><page sequence="9">[9] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 185 Kimhi's classification of knowledge appears then to incorporate elements of previous systems, notably those of R. Saadia Gaon. His addition of haggadah together with his novel interpretation of sensory perception might have been intended to support his own notion of the transmission of knowledge, that is, through popular compendia. (b) Prophecy The nature of prophecy and the qualifications and prerequisites of the prophet were major topics in medieval philosophical literature. The point of departure for such discussions, especially those of Halevi and Maimonides, was the theory of prophecy attributed to the Greek philosophers, which consisted of five major premises. These were (1) that God acts through necessity ; (2) that prophecy is transmitted indirectly through the Active Intellect; (3) that the prophet must possess certain qualifications such as moral and intellectual perfection as achieved by training in the arts and sciences; (4) that the moral virtues are auxiliary to the intellectual virtues; and (5) that there is no special mode of conduct prescribed for the attainment of prophecy.34 A comparison of Kimhi's views on these points with those of Maimonides and Halevi will show that Kimhi usually stressed the distinctly Maimonidean elements in his theory of prophecy. It must be noted, however, that Kimhi's purpose was not to present a formal discussion of the subject but rather to outline certain points which he felt were germane to his exegetical remarks. (1) The consensus of Jewish thinkers in the middle ages, Halevi and Maimonides among them, was, of course, to reject the notion that God acts under compulsion and to affirm that He acts with free will.35 Kimhi was apparently silent on this subject. It is possible that since this view was so widely accepted, Kimhi felt no need to mention it. (2) Halevi and Maimonides differed in their reaction to the notion that prophecy is achieved by means of the Active Intellect. Halevi, who was of the opinion that everything in the world was caused directly by the will of God, rejected the notion of inter mediaries in general and of the role of the so-called Active Intellect in prophecy in particular.36 Maimonides, on the other hand, believed 34 H. A. Wolfson, "Hallevi and Maimonides on Prophecy," JQR, N.S. 33 (1942-43), pp. 350-353• 3s H. A.

"Everything comes from God by means of the managing angels . . . The work of the Lord is [achieved] through intermediaries ('emza'iyyim), and the angels are the emissaries to His servants to guard them and to benefit them." "The angels rule in the lower world, and all the work of the Lord is [achieved] through them and by means of them."38 Kimhi further agreed with Maimonides concerning the nature of the angels or separate intelligences which were considered by them to be incorporeal in contrast with the spheres which were composed of ether (homer zakh, yesod hamishi).39 Maimonides pointed out, however, that the term maVakhim is a homonym which can refer not only to the separate intelligences but, among other things, to the spheres themselves.40 Conversely, Kimhi remarked that angels can be referred to by the term "heavens" as in Ps. 148:1. In a similar fashion, he echoed Maimonides' exegesis of the terms ,elohe ha-elohim and 'adone ha-'adonitn, saying that the terms 'elohim and ,adonim refer to the created ('alulirn) spheres.41 Kimhi was in accord with Maimonides then on the role of the intermediary or angel in prophecy. No specific mention of the Active Intellect was made, since Kimhi probably felt the concept to be too technical for mention in the general commentaries and referred only to angels or intermediaries. Thus he interpreted: "[The prophet] said, 'O Lord, God' twice and again said 'and Lord God and indeed Lord God,' since he was speaking in prophecy and prophecy comes to the prophet by means of angels."42 Kimhi further referred the phrase "and God said" to an angel in accordance with Maimonides' statement that even when a prophet says that God spoke to him, it was an angel that did so.43 3737 Guide 11:36. 38 Gen. 48:15; Zech. 1:8; cf.

In this context, Kimlji found particularly useful the rabbinic references to the sharing of God's name by his servants (Zech. 3:2; he refers there also to Jud. 6:22).</page><page sequence="11">[11] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 187 (3) In regard to the third statement of the philosophers, Mai monides agreed that "preparation and perfection in moral and rational virtues are necessary" for prophecy, while Halevi rejected this notion affirming that intellectual perfection or training in the arts and sciences do not prepare one for prophecy.44 Kimhi once again stood with Maimonides and stated explicitly that the prophet must be wise (hakham) and of perfect character (shalem(shalem be-middothaw).45 To this Kimhi added, as did Maimonides, that the prophet must be free of material concerns. Therefore no prophecy came to Jacob during Joseph's absence because of the former's depression. If "the spirit is not free of material concerns, the intellect will not cleave to it since the intellect cleaves only to its like."46 (4) Maimonides was in agreement with the philosophers that the moral and practical virtues occupied a subordinate position with respect to the intellectual virtues.47 Halevi, on the other hand, con sidered moral qualities primary prerequisites for prophecy.48 Kimhi did not deal with this point in his discussion of prophecy and men tioned only that the prophet must be wise (hakham) and of perfect character (shalem be-middothaw) .49 He did not comment however on the relation between the two. (5) Halevi rejected the fifth point in the system of the "philoso phers" and insisted that there was a definite mode of action required for the prophet, namely that which was prescribed in the Law of Moses.50 Maimonides was not clear on this point although he did maintain that the object of the Law was the development of the intellectual, moral, and practical virtues.51 This problem, of course, bears directly on the question of whether a gentile may be granted the gift of prophecy. According to Halevi, the gentile was barred from the gift of prophecy, not only by his nonobservance of the Torah but also by virtue of the fact that prophecy was hereditary among the Hebrew people to the exclusion of gentiles. Indeed even a convert is not capable of attaining the gift of prophecy.52 However, •ויי Kuz. 1:79■ 98'111:23 ;11:49 '• 45 Introd. to Psalms. 46 Gen. 45:27; cf. Isa. 28:9; Joel 3:1.

He explained that Zechariah's prophecies were obscure because "the power of prophecy was becoming weaker" (Zech. 1:8; 5:3, 9). 47 Guide 11:36; Hil. Yesode ha-torah VI1:4. 48 Kuz.

There is a statement in the Mishneh TorahTorah which grants prophecy to gentiles and one in the Iggereth TemanTeman which would seem to imply the same.54 In the Guide, however, all gentile prophets mentioned in the Bible are limited to the second level of prophecy which is, in fact, not really prophecy but a state remotely resembling it.55 Kimhi followed the principles of Halevi and Maimonides, viz., the virtual monopoly of Israel with respect to prophecy with the admission that the gentiles might be capable of a certain inferior type of prophecy. The only gentile to whom Kimhi referred as a prophet was Noah. The latter may have merited this distinction by virtue of the fact that he lived in an age in which the distinction between Jew and gentile did not yet exist.56 Other gentiles, however, were as a rule not worthy of prophecy.57 Pharaoh's dreams were a pseudoprophecy {ki-demuth{ki-demuth nevu'ah). They were perfectly obvious to any one with understanding. Nevertheless, God confounded his sages so that they would need the help of Joseph to understand them.58 However, Kimhi allowed the gentiles dreams which were "to a great extent prophetic" (heleq gadol min ha-nevu'ah) on the level of the dreams of Joseph and Gideon.59 This would appear to be the counterpart of the type of prophecy allowed by Halevi and Mai monides. Yet Kimhi went one step farther. He allowed that under extraordinary circumstances, for the sake of Israel, a gentile might be endowed with prophecy.60 Thus God appeared to Laban on account of Jacob.61 Balaam was referred to as a soothsayer (qosem) in Josh. 13:22 "to indicate that he was not a prophet but a soothsayer and his prophecy was only for a particular occasion; or an angel of the Lord came to him to speak those prophecies because of Israel." This prin ciple parallels Kimhi's notion that gentiles were affected by divine providence for the sake of Israel alone.62 Kimhi was, of course, more 55 Wolfson, JQR N.S. 33, pp. 63 f. "" Hit.

His principle that this could occur only "for the sake of Israel" was a compromise with the premises acquired from the philosophers. An important element in Maimonides' theory of prophecy was his classification of the prophets into eleven different "degrees." Because of the various factors required for the conferring of the gift of prophecy on an individual, it was only natural that not all prophets would be equal and that there would be distinctions between them. The first two degrees were indeed not true prophecy. The first, "the Spirit of the Lord," was characterized by a zealous desire to save an individual or a community, while the second, "the Holy Spirit," marked an individual's recitation of words of wisdom or praise in the waking state. The third through the seventh levels consisted of various stages of the prophetic dream in which the prophet would, respectively, see a self-explanatory image, hear words, see a man speaking, see an angel speaking, or God speaking. The eighth through the eleventh degrees represented the levels in a prophetic vision in which the prophet might see an image, hear words, see a man speaking, or hear an angel speaking.63 The vision came upon the prophet while he was awake but the senses were phased so that only the intellect functioned.64 Maimonides' notions of the degrees of prophecy are reflected in Kimhi's writings but not reproduced exactly. For example, the first level, "the Spirit of the Lord," was not mentioned by Kimhi explicitly. Yet it may be identified with his explanation of the false prophets of Ahab. This is very confusing to him who understands it literally. The truth is that God aroused the spirit of the false prophets to entice Ahab to go to Ramoth-gilead since he was deserving of death by heavenly decree. A spirit of prophecy did not come to any of them — but there took place rather an arousing of the spirit and a desire to speak these things to Ahab.65 Although indeed the "spirit of the Lord" was described by Mai monides as leading to positive actions and the activity of the false prophets was decidedly negative, the mechanics in each case appear to be the same, namely "an arousal of the spirit" to action. 63 Guide 11:45■ 64 Guide 11:41. 65 I Kings 22:20.</page><page sequence="14">190 FRANK TALMAGE [14] The first stage of prophecy, which Kimhi mentioned explicitly in his introduction to the Book of Psalms, is the second in Maimonides' classification — the holy spirit. In this state, according to Kimhi, one speaks in his ordinary manner and is in full possession of his senses while a higher spirit (ruah 'elyonah) addresses him. Praise and thanksgiving (shevaJ), we-hoda'ah) come to him (yofi'u 'al leshono) or words of wisdom or moral guidance (divre sekhel u-musarim) might be spoken. In this state, one can also speak of the future66 with God's help through the rational intellect, as did Daniel in the exile. Maimonides, too, placed Daniel at the level of the "holy spirit," partly because he had to account for the fact that the Book of Daniel was included in the Hagiographa and not in the prophetic writings.67 Yet Maimonides took an experience of Daniel as an illustration of the prophetic vision. "And I saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me, for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength" (Dan. 10:8). He afterwards continued: "Thus I was in deep sleep (lying) on my face, with my face toward the ground" (Dan. 10:9). But it was in a prophetic vision that the angel spoke to him and set him upon his knees.68 This use of Daniel as an example of a prophetic vision was taken up by Kimlii. "Also [Saul] stripped off his clothes" (I Sam. 19:24). This teaches that the other prophets stripped off their clothes as implied by the word "also." This is explained by the fact that when prophecy descends upon a person, his senses are phased and he will fall. It is said concerning Balaam "fallen down, yet with open eyes" (Num. 24:4, 16) and concerning Daniel "I was in deep sleep (lying) on my face, with my face toward the ground" (Dan. 10:9).6' Asher Crescas in his commentary to the Guide noticed this apparent contradiction in Maimonides caused by the latter's attempts to ex plain away the references to Daniel's prophecy found in the Book of Daniel. Crescas avoided this predicament by explaining that while Daniel was on a higher level than David and Solomon (i. e., that of the holy spirit), he was not a true prophet since he had no appointed mission.70 Apparently Kimhi was aware of this difficulty also. Although 66 Cf. Ps. 6:9; 12:1. 67 Guide 11:45■ 68 Guide 11:41. 6י I Sam. 19:24. Maimonides classified Balaam in the second rank "when he was good" (Guide 11:45). 70 Comm. to Guide 11:41.</page><page sequence="15">[15] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 191 he placed Daniel at the equivalent of Maimonides' second level, he did not deny him true prophecy. Rather, Daniel did "see visions (mar'oth(mar'oth we-kezyonoth) in the dream and waking states, [but] his capacity and his knowledge (ko}}0 wi-di'atho) did not reach the capacity of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and the other prophets." This distinction, although forced, avoids the pitfall of Maimonides. David and Solomon were included by Kimhi, just as they were by Maimonides, in the degree of the "holy spirit." Even though some of the Psalms were given prophetic titles, "their prophecy was in any event through this manner," i. e., through the holy spirit. Indeed with reference to the Psalms, the terms be-ruah ha-qodesh and be-ruah nevu'ahnevu'ah were used almost interchangeably. The Sons of Asaph played on musical instruments and the holy spirit lay on Asaph and he would sing to the sound of the harps. Both Heman and Asaph were prophets with musical instru ments. The Book of Psalms was uttered through the holy spirit and has prophecies and forebodings (nevu'oth wa-'athidoth) of the exile and redemption.71 Presumably, the distinction applied to Daniel might also be applied to David and Solomon. In other words, they were prophets but not of the rank of the true prophets.72 11י Chron. 25:1. Kim hi used the expressions be-ruah nevu'ah (Gen. 49:1; 49:12; II Chron. 21:22) and be-derekh nevu'ah (Gen. 9:26; 15:12; Hab. 3:1; Zech. 12:12; Ps. 12:6; 28:6) and be-ruah ha-qodesh (Gen. 2:13; 7:24; 27:27). At Gen. 2:13; 7:24, Moses is said to have known all the historical details recorded in the Book of Genesis through the holy spirit and not through prophecy. See especially the equating of ruah nevu'ah with ruah ha-qodesh at I Chron. 28:72. Cf. Targum to Song of Songs 1:1 where ruah qudsha and then ruah nevu'ah are used for Solomon's inspiration and 1:2 where the expression shelomoh nevi'a is used. 72 Kimlji tended to be somewhat less exclusive in his own "bestowal" of prophecy. For example, where Maimonides limited the revelation on Mt. Sinai to Moses, allowing the people only an intellectual recognition of the first two commandments {Guide{Guide 11:33), Kimhi remarked as follows: "... and He brought down His Shekhinah before them on Mt. Sinai . . . and let them hear His words until they were at the level of prophets. Yet they were not equal as our Rabbis said, Moses had his own place and Aaron had his own place (Mekhilta de RaShBI, ed. Hoffmann, p. 102) . . . and so with all of them each according to his intellect. . . and the most perceptive {daqqe{daqqe ha-'iyyun) grasped and understood the subtle spiritual matters" (Isa. 28:29). Further, Maimonides understood the verse "And it shall come to pass after ward that I shall pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy . . ." (Joel 3:1) to mean that all the children shall prophesy but that what is meant is incantation, dream, or intellectual insight and not genuine prophecy {Guide{Guide 11:32; see Efodi, a. I.). Kimhi, however, referred the verse to only some of the children {qezath benekhem). Maimonides therefore was of the opinion that the</page><page sequence="16">116] 192 FRANK TALMAGE Following the second degree of ruah ha-qodesh, Maimonides listed the five gradations of prophecy in the dream state as cited above. In Kimhi'sKimhi's classification, these five degrees are conflated into one, the halom.73halom.73 Our author's survey takes no account then of the varieties of the prophetic dream. Elsewhere, however, Kimhi pointed out the difference between the ordinary dream in which the imaginary faculty alone functioned and the prophecy in which the intellective or ra tional faculty played a role.74 Maimonides next listed the four levels of prophecy in the waking state, the prophetic vision. Kimfii listed three levels at this stage which corresponded to the tenth, eighth and ninth degrees, respec tively, of Maimonides. These are: (x) the prophet will see a man speaking to him, (2) he will see images (dimyonoth) in the vision, (3) he will see no form (temunah) but just hear a sound. The eleventh degree of Maimonides, that of the vision of the angel, was not men tioned by Kimhi in his introduction to the Psalms. At Isa. 48:16, however, Kimhi observed that "sometimes a prophet will hear a voice without seeing an angel and other times will see an angel in a prophetic vision." Kimhi's description of the prophetic vision reflects that of Mai monides. Essentially, the sensory faculties are nulled so that the intellectual faculty may function at full strength. Thus Kimhi remarked that the prophet may "remove his garments because of the complete phasing of the senses and emotions and will remain with the intellectual faculty alone."75 Kimhi refers to the theophany of Isaiah 6 as a prophetic vision as perceived by the intellect and [which is] not perceived by anything outside the intellect, for the angels which he called seraphim have no body nor face nor feet nor wings according to the opinion of the sages, the philosophers.76 The above material reveals that Kimhi's views on prophecy reflect in the main those of Maimonides. The former's brief attempts at prophecy mentioned in this verse belongs to the lower levels, while Kim hi believed that it refers to the higher "so that there will be levels among them, one higher than the other, as there were in the former prophets. So there will be among them [those who will be as great] as Moses, our Master, whose intellect will be purified. The rational faculty will increase in some of them so that they will prophesy for he did not say that they would all prophesy." 73 Cf. Joel 3:1. 74 Jer. 23:28. 75 I Sam. 19:25. 76 Isa. 6:2.</page><page sequence="17">[17] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 193 systematization represent a survey and summary of Maimonidean notions with minor variations rather than an exact reproduction. While we have attempted to account for one of these departures from Maimonides' system, it is difficult to determine whether the others were intentional or merely incidental since Kimhi rarely elaborated on these matters. (c) Providence The topic of providence, or God's concern for his creatures, was a subject for treatment in all medieval philosophical works. The first full discussion of the topic, on which all later analyses were based, was that of Maimonides in the Guide for the Perplexed.'''' Maimonides discussed five theories of providence with which he was familiar: (a) the doctrine of Epicurus according to which everything happens by chance, (b) the Aristotelian view according to which there is providence for the species but not the individual, (c) the opinion of the 'Asharites who say that everything that happens in the universe is a result of God's will, thereby denying man's free will, (d) the opinion of the Mu'tazilites who, in contradistinction to the 'Asharites, affirm man's free will and claim that God does everything for the best, and finally (e) the view of the Torah which affirms man's free will and also maintains that reward and punishment are justly distributed.78 To these five theories, Maimonides added his own view which, he claimed, was based solely on Scripture. According to this view, man alone in the sublunar world merited individual providence, while all other creatures were governed by chance. With respect to the latter, providence extended only to the species which was preserved from extinction. Even among men, however, the amount of providence enjoyed by each individual was not the same, but was dependent on the person's intellectual attainments and character. Thus the prophet would receive the greatest amount of providence while the impious boor would be relegated to the class of the lower animals.79 Providence ('inâya, hashgahah) was defined in the Guide as govern ment (hanhagah) and regulation (siddur).8° It may be noted that, originally, Ibn Tibbon had used the term shemirah (protection) for " Guide 111:17» 18&gt; 51• 8י Guide 111:17.

However, the former finally adopted the term hashgahah, a term closer to the Latin providential1 Unlike Maimonides, Kimhi compiled no single formal discussion of the topic of providence. As with other subjects, his views must be culled from various passages in the commentaries. The first thing that strikes one is that Kimhi was engaged in a constant polemic against the position represented by Maimonides' first theory — that ascribed to Epicurus — whose adherents claimed that everything happens by accident (miqreh). To this group, Kimhi, as had Mai monides, applied Lev. 26:2: " 'And if you walk contrary (be-qeri) unto me,' i. e., that you will say that chastisement which I bring upon you is by chance (derekh miqreh) and not as recompense for your sins."82 Such was the opinion of the investigators (hakhme ha-mehqar) and the misguided (jto'im) who claimed that everything was deter mined by fate.83 Kimhi also had a word to say against those who did recognize God but saw no positive power in him. These claimed that "the good and evil which come to man [do not have their source] in Him [for] He is not concerned with the lower world."84 This group corresponds to the second theory listed by Maimonides — that ascribed to Aristotle. It was they who claimed that "God has forsaken the earth."83 Against these sceptics, Kimhi affirmed that God was indeed directly concerned with the lower world and especially with man.86 What was the nature of God's providence, according to Kimhi and to what degree did it extend to His creatures? We may begin by noting that, as in the Guide, the terms hashgahah and seder ha-hanhagah (order of government — corresponding to Mai monides' siddur we-hanhagah) are used in conjunction with each other. The roots shgh (adopted by Ibn Tibbon) and shmr (adopted by Harizi) are also used conjointly in the phrase mashgihim we-shomerim.87 These terms were apparently not synonymous for Kimhi, however. In his discussion of the four faces of the hayyoth in Ezek. 1:10, Kimfii 81 Cf. Z. Diesendruck, "Samuel and Moses Ibn Tibbon on Providence," HUCA 11 (1936), p. 345; S.

In connection with this he polemicizes against those who deny the eternity of the world (Gen. 1:2; Isa. 42:5; Ps. 8:5). 84 Zeph. i ;12. 83 Ezek. 9:9; Guide 111:17• 86 Nah. 1:9; Hab. 1:3; 2:14. 87 Phil. Comm. to Ezek. 1:13.</page><page sequence="19">[19] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 195 observed that the four faces represent the four animal kingdoms — man, beast, living creatures, and birds — and that they are here mentioned in connection with God's providence over them. He then goes on to say that "the government (hanhagah) of the world by means of the ,ofanim is equal for the four faces, as we have explained them, but the protection (shemirah) is not equal." Here Kimhi apparently made a terminological distinction between two types of providence discussed in the Guide for the Perplexed. Hanhagah would appear to refer to that type of hashgaljah which extends to the species of the sublunar world, but shemirah would apply to God's concern for the individual. As in the Guide, it is man who benefits from individual providence. Kimhi further shares Maimonides' premise that the degree of individual providence is directly proportional to one's spiritual attainment, i. e. religious and intellectual perfection. Thus, when a man withdraws from rational activity (sikhliyyoth) and reli gious practice (shim'iyyoth), then "he and the ox eat from the [same] manger,"88 that is to say, he is to be considered as an animal with respect to providence.89 With reference to animals, divine providence extends only to the species. This is discussed in connection with Ps. 36:6 "Your loving kindness, O Lord, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches unto the skies." [God's] faithfulness (''emunah) is the preservation of the species [qiyyum ha-min] from destruction, for although the individuals . . . perish the species survives forever . . . Loving kindness (hesed) refers to the preparation for the maintenance of the world, for He prepares each animal's food in the most convenient fashion for it without great toil [on the animal's part]. . . for that which is most necessary for the maintenance of the world is most common. Liquids are more necessary for the maintenance of life than are foods; therefore, water is more abundant than food and [involves] no work or preparation . . . An entire species is eradicated only when it is wholly corrupt. If it is for the most part good, God will maintain it.90 8888 Phil.88 Phil. Comm. to Ezek., end. Cf. the statement of Maimonides (Guide 11:36): ".".. . the multitude must be considered according to their true worth; some of them are undoubtedly like domesticated cattle and others like wild beasts, and these only engage the mind of the perfect and distinguished man insofar as he desires to guard himself from injury in case of contact with them and to derive some benefit from them when necessary." 8י Cf.

Let us however look at another passage in the philosophical commentary to Ezekiel. The passage (Ezek. 1:6), we are told, refers to the Rider's (i. e., the Active Intellect) shemirah of the entire animal kingdom (min ha-hay) ; or if we say that shemirah applies only to man, because of the superior nature by virtue of which he is man, then the four faces [of the hayyoth] refer to man [alone]. In this passage, one notes an ambivalence in Kimhi's attitude. The possibility is admitted that man may not be unique in the recep tion of shemirah or individual providence. Fortunately, we are not left in the dark concerning what Kimhi meant by this. In expounding Ps. 145:17, "the Lord is righteous in all His ways," Kimhi made the following statement: For the Lord gives every living thing its sustenance rightly and properly. Even though one creature preys upon another and eats it — as the cat does the mouse; and the lion, the bear and the leopard eat other animals; and the birds prey upon other birds —all this is just on God's part. For He gives food to the beasts of prey in their lifetime, but when their time comes to die, He decrees previously that their death will come sometime in feeding others and sometimes He decrees that they them selves die. And it is quite the same to the victim whether he dies naturally or is killed.91 This is a perplexing problem to the sages. Some of them say that when the cat preys upon the mouse and the lion upon the lamb, it is punishment for the victim from God. I have found a similar view in the words of the Rabbis: "When Rabbi Yolianan would see a cormorant drawing fish from the sea, he would say: 'Your judgments are like the great deep' (Ps. 36:7)" (Hullin 63a). And some of them say there is no reward and no punishment for animals except human beings. We say that there is reward and punishment for the rest of the animals in connection with their dealings with men. For we have found "at the hand of every beast will I require it" (Gen. 9:5). It is said further "and the destruction of the beasts which made them afraid" (Hab. 2:17). It is said also concerning reward "and the lion had not eaten the carcass nor torn the ass" (I Kings 13:28). The Rabbis were explicit concerning reward for beasts like the ass and the dog. For they said: "Why were the first born of asses singled out with respect to redemption? Because they bore the booty of Israel."92 It is further said: "You shall cast it to the dogs" (Exod. 22:30). יי At Gen. 1:25, Kimhi states that when animals are killed, it is by chance. Cf. Saadia, 'Emunoth III (end; Rosenblatt, p. 175). «2 Referring to Bekhoroth 5b.</page><page sequence="21">[21] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 197 "But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue" (Exod. 11:7). This teaches that God does not deprive any creature of its reward.93 There is another view which is not worth recording. In this passage, Kimhi has alluded to four views of the question of providence for animals. They are: (1) animals killed by other animals deserve their death because of past iniquities;94 (2) only human beings and not animals receive reward and punishment; (3) animals receive reward or punishment when their actions benefit or harm human beings, and (4) an opinion which Kimhi declined to mention. The first view can be identified with that of the 'Asharites {Guide{Guide III:17), while the second view is that of Maimonides himself. It is this view which, as we have seen, Kimhi himself adopted in several passages. The fourth view cannot be identified with certainty, although Kimhi might be referring to the view of the Mu'tazilites as expressed in the Guide. It is the third opinion that Kimhi claimed as his own, thus departing from Maimonides in this regard. Unlike Maimonides, Kimhi devotes some space to discussions of the question of providence for gentiles. We have dealt with this problem at length elsewhere.95 Briefly stated, his view concerning this question follows his understanding of providence in general. In other words, while there is generally no special providence for gentiles, it exists for the sages among them. Thus the fact of special providence for Israel is due to their being a nation of sages and not to any arbitrary decision on God's part. Kimhi's treatment of the problems of reward and punishment and theodicy offers little that is original and consists of standard présenta tions and solutions. The fact that the just are rewarded and the wicked punished is stressed.96 Kimhi was most fond of pointing out situations in the Bible where retributive justice as expressed by "measure for measure" {middah ke-neged middah) can be seen. Thus Jacob was made to limp after his encounter with the angel because of his lapses into disbelief in God's promises.97 The exceptions to this rule were approached with various solu tions. On the one hand, Kimhi might counsel resignation and accep tance as in his statement: "even though some of the righteous die, « Referring to Mekhilta, Mish. 20. 4י On the possible sources, rabbinic and non-Jewish, for this view, see Talmage, I.I. c.

He knows what He does and we are not to question Him."98 On the other hand, he might advance the best-of-all-possible-worlds theory. If one considers the state of the world, he will see that for the most part God is a "God of faith with no injustice" (Deut. 32:4) and "gives everyone according to his ways and the fruit of his words" (Jer. 17:10). Concerning the bit that he sees which is not according to order, let him say in his heart that God knows why this is and we do not. Let him attribute ignorance to himself and not injustice to God." Yet when he could seize upon some excuse, however feeble, to vindicate God's behavior he did so. For example, the extermination of the righteous along with the wicked in Sodom was due to the fact that they would not dedicate themselves to causing the sinners to repent. If so, there is no power in their righteousness to forgive the city for their sake — but some of them will perish100 with the wicked and some will be saved — all according to their righteousness.101 The wicked, for their part, may prosper. "He provides sustenance even for those who deny Him."102 But God has his reasons for this too. All evil that is committed is done with God's permission103 (ba lit-lit tammetamme pothehim 10).104 The wicked are encouraged by an inclination found in them from childhood, which is personified by Satan,105 although no one is made to sin. Absalom, for example, might have sinned by his own inclination. However, had David acted properly, he would have been prevented from doing so.106 The "iniquity of the Amorite" mentioned in Gen. 15:16 was taken to refer to the punishment of that iniquity, perhaps so that God might not be considered as causing evil. Kimhi, as is to be expected, pointed out that if one does not get one's due in this world, he will certainly receive it in the next.107 The soul of the righteous "delights in the 8י Isa. 65:13. יי Ps. 107:43. 100 Yelkhu, an Arabism. 101 Gen. 18:24. 102 Ps. 36.6. 103 Ps. 33:9.

Maimonides, by destroying the Aristotelian system of necessity, . . . had established the possibility of miracles; yet he was far from returning to the naive faith of popular religion. This can best be seen in his Commentary on the Mishnah, where he teaches that the disposition for miracles was implanted in nature at the time of creation. Both the regular processes of nature and the ex traordinary events which cannot be deduced from the natural order derive from the immanent course of events because of the disposition with which nature was endowed at its creation. In the Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides no longer seems to maintain this extreme position, which admits the possible eruption of God into the order of nature. These eruptions, however, are not conceived as a subsequent suspension of the natural order, but as part of the original overall divine plan for the world.110 KimhiKimhi shared Maimonides' ambivalence111 on the question of miracles. He apparently believed with the latter that miracles had been established in the natural order at the time of creation for he confirmed the midrashic statement that Jonah's fish had been prepared for the prophet during the six days of creation.112 On the other hand, we are never certain of what, to Kimhi's mind, a miracle actually is. For example, events such as the struggle in the womb between Jacob and Esau113 and Jonah's retention of his presence of mind"4 while in the fish are termed miracles by Kimhi. Such statements appear as part of a trend in Kimfii's writings to indicate that miracles are phenomena which do not necessarily imply a change in nature. With reference to the question of why God did not cause the wind to blow so that the cloud of glory in the desert might be dispersed in order that the Israelites could be circumcised, Kimfii wrote: and God would not change the order of the world for even though He changes the order of the world in some miracles, He will not 108 Ps.

Even the miracle of the resurrection of Elisha might be natural as Kimhi wrote: [It is] as we explained concerning Elijah for there [Scripture] stated "and he stretched out on the boy." This is to indicate [in a physical manner] the person for whom the prayer is made, as it says concerning Isaac [that he prayed] against (le-nokhak), i. e. for, his wife. It is possible that he meant to breathe on the boy to warm him with natural heat coming from his body, for most miracles are performed quite naturally with a minimum of invention (tafybulah)."6 In a similar vein, Kimhi stated with reference to the ascension of Elijah to heaven: "The opinion of our masses and indeed of our sages is that God brought him bodily into paradise, just as Adam was before he sinned, and that He took up Enoch in the same fashion." Kimhi believed instead that Elijah's body was burned and he became entirely incorporeal.117 When he could find no natural explanation for a miracle, Kimfii might try to minimize it as much as possible. Thus he claimed that only a small part of the wall of Jericho fell rather than the entire wall. This, he believed, was all that the text itself implies.118 However, there are instances of miracles which Kimhi apparently could not rationalize and consequently he let them stand, especially if Maimonides had done the same. Thus, while Gersonides made a definite attempt to explain away the miracle of the standing of the sun at Gibeon, Maimonides and Kimhi both refrained from forcing the issue.119 Although Kimhi attempted to rationalize Elisha's resurrection of the young boy, concerning the parallel miracle of Elijah he wrote: There is one who says that he did not die at all but that his illness was critical so that his breathing had ceased and no sign of life was perceptible. There was neither breathing nor pulse so that his mother thought he was dead . . . However, the correct interpretation is that he actually died, as people think.120 "י Josh. 5:2. 116 II Kings 4:34.

He wished to affirm that Maimonides did not, as had been charged,"3 try to deny as many miracles as possible. It is true that Maimonides had stated: "It is known that we disdain the conception of a change in the natural order.""4 Yet, in the final analysis, both Maimonides and Kimhi admitted the reality of miracles in the traditional sense."5 (d) The Law and fa'ame ha-mi?woth The two aspects of biblical law, ritual and moral, were a matter of interest and concern in postbiblical literature. The Rabbis dis tinguished between the two classes of laws: mishpatim, the ordinances dictated by basic morality, and huqqim, the statutes dictated by God for His own, often obscure reasons. "My ordinances shall you do" (Lev. 18:4). This refers to those [laws] written in the Torah that, had they not been written, should indeed have been, such as, proscriptions against thievery, incest, idolatry, cursing God, and bloodshed . . . "And my statutes." This refers to those about which the evil inclina tion and the idolators argue [with Israel], such as the proscrip tions against the eating of swine and the wearing of kU'ayim, halizah,halizah, purification of the leper, the red heifer, and the scape goat. . . God has said: "I have decreed" — you are not allowed to repudiate them."6 The talmudic conception of mishpatim, which was similar to the Greek concept of natural law, was continued by Saadia in his distinc tion between the rational Çagliyyât, sikhliyyoth) and revelational (sam'iyyàt,(sam'iyyàt, shim'iyyoth) precepts. Following an analogous Mu'tazilite classification, Saadia conceived of the rational commandments as those 121 Guide 1:42. 121 As is well known, Maimonides wrote his Treatise on Resurrection as an answer to charges that he did not believe in resurrection.

(Saadia's concept of mind {'aql, sekhel) con noted an instinct (fitra) by which truth, including moral truth, could be recognized just as the senses recognize the percepts.) Saadia sought reasons for the revelational laws which were usually based on the concept of their usefulness for man or on principles of Platonic ethics.127 While not employing the same terminology, Ibn Ezra followed this basic distinction of Saadia. Know that all the commandments fall into two classes. The first are those implanted by God in the hearts of all men of understanding . . . These are the commandments, among others, which Abraham observed. Indeed, God gave the Torah only to men of understanding, and he who has no understanding has no Torah. The second class are those commandments which are obscure and whose reasons were not made explicit. Heaven forbid that one of those commandments contradict reason. We must however observe everything the Lord commanded us whether its inner meaning is apparent to us or not. All of these . . . [however] have their own inner reason even though it may not be clear to us. The proof for this is that the reasons for some of them were stated [explicitly] such as the Sabbath, etc.128 Saadia's conception of the rational commandments as principles implanted in the mind is reflected in Ibn Ezra's first class of com mandments, piqqudim.I2g The second class of commandments, the revelational or huqqoth, was further divided into two groups, those which had an explicit reason stated in the Bible and those which did not. Ibn Ezra further divided the commandments into the categories of precepts of the heart (mizwoth ha-lev), of the tongue (mizwoth ha-lashon),ha-lashon), and of action (mizwoth 'aseh). Each of these was further divided into positive and negative commandments, a fundamental distinction which had long been in use in halakhic works.130 Maimonides maintained the distinction between the two major classes of biblical laws as recognized by his predecessors but reverted to the rabbinic terminology of hoq and mishpat (or mizwah).13I In rejecting Saadia's terminology, Maimonides also rejected the premises 127 A.

For Maimonides, reason could distinguish between true and false alone — not right and wrong — and so had no relation to moral law. The latter fell into the category of mefursamoth or conventional principles.132 Kimlji's own general statement of classification is found in his comment to Gen. 26:5. "My commandments (mizwothay), my statutes (huqqothay) my laws (torothay)"— this includes all the rational command ments — those which are universally known (mefursamoth) and those which are not. Among the seven Noahide commandments, there are those of which the reasons are known only to the wise, such as the prohibitions against mating different species of animals, grafting of trees,133 and the eating of a limb from a live animal. Therefore He said huqqothay. He said mizwothay to include all the rational commandments whether they belong to the heart, the hand, or the mouth — whether they be positive or negative. Once again one finds the distinction between the "rational" com mandments (mizwoth) and the "traditional" or, as Kimhi called them, "statutes" (huqqoth). The latter were defined as those commandments "the reason for which is not revealed to everyone,134 or "revealed only to the wise."135 The rational commandments (mizwoth, mizwoth ha-sekhel) were apparently taken by Kimhi in the same sense in which Ibn Ezra understood them. Indeed our author made use of the term piqqudim for this category after the usage of Ibn Ezra. These are "the rational commandments which God deposited (hifqidam) and placed in the heart, and reason instructs one in them."136 Again: ". . . they are like a deposit (piqqadon) and something concealed in man's heart."137 This class was divided by Kimhi into the conventional and non conventional precepts (mefursamoth and she- enam mefursamoth).138 This added distinction between conventional and nonconventional rational commandments seems to recognize the Maimonidean objec tion to the application of the concept of reason to morality. Yet the difficulty is compounded rather than resolved. Unfortunately, Kimlji's 152 A. Altmann, I. c. (n. 127), p. 334. Cf. The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics Ethics (ed. J. I.

Ibn Ezra on Lev. 19:19.</page><page sequence="28">204 FRANK TALMAGE [28] understanding of this problem must remain obscure because of the brevity of his discussion. Nevertheless, one can determine that Kimhi relied principally on pre-Maimonidean conceptions and terminology in his classification of the commandments. Indeed, Kimhi made no use of the term mishpat for the "rational" commandments as Maimonides had done139 and retained the old Saadianic usage of sikhliyyoth and shim'iyyoth on occa sion.140 Ibn Ezra's influence can be traced also in Kimhi's division of the commandments into those of the heart, the hand, and the mouth. Kimhi's actual discussion of the "reasons" for the commandments {ta'ame{ta'ame ka-mizwoth) was limited by virtue of the fact that he did not comment on the legal portions of the Pentateuch. Those few ex planations which he did provide were motivated by the fact that "he who does not understand a commandment will not observe it properly."141 This practical objective of stating reasons for the com mandments characterized Maimonides' citing of te'amim in the MishnehMishneh Torah. His object in the Guide, on the other hand, was more speculative. For the enlightened, he wished to demonstrate that the biblical precepts have as their object "the well-being of the soul and the well-being of the body." He rejected the view of those who say that the precepts have no purpose, being dictated by the will of God. On the contrary, all the commandments have definite aims, even though we might be ignorant concerning some of them. This specula tive approach to the ta'ame ha-mizwoth was echoed by Kimhi in his remarks on Psalm 19. fHow can the words] "perfect, restoring the soul" [and so forth] be applied to the entire Law? Indeed they can refer only to those commandments whose reasons are revealed and apparent. On the other hand, the statutes (huqqim), like [the prohibitions against] the eating of swine and the wearing of sha'atnez, whose reasons are not known to everyone, how can one sav that they are pleasant, sweet, and pure? They are indeed all this to those to whom their reasons are known, but to most men their reasons are unknown.142 That he was aware of the apparent "absurdity" of certain command ments is shown by the following statement. "Man abhors that which 1" Kimfii defined mishpafim as the commandments which relate to the relation ship "between man and his fellow" (ben ,adam la-fiavero). Cf. Ps. 119:8. 140 He mentions (Ps. 107:11) that the shim'iyyoth were given to Israel and not to the gentiles (read: Abraham instead of Adam). In the Phil. Comm. to Ezek. 1:13 the terms shim'iyyoth and sikhliyyoth seem to refer to intellectual activity in general rather than the precepts themselves. Cf. Gen. 20:6. 141 Ps. 119:129. 144 Ps. 19:8.</page><page sequence="29">[29] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 205 the intellect rejects except the commandments."143 In other words, certain of the commandments seem at first blush irrational. On the other hand, he was caught in the same ambivalent position in which Maimonides found himself.144 Like the latter, he could state the impropriety of seeking out ta'ame ha-mizwoth and then proceed to reveal them. "One must not ask a reason for what the Creator decided," declared Kimhi in the same breath with "the reason [Joshua and the Israelites] walked with the trumpets was to frighten the people in the city. The secret of the number seven is known to the knowledgeable (mevine(mevine madda')."lAS His explanations of the precepts are generally commonplace. Thus, circumcision is a sign on the organ which is responsible for most sins,146 while kU'ayim is taken to be a breach of God's handiwork in trying to supercede Him.147 The explanation of the observance of the Sabbath as a reminder of creation was given a novel twist when Kimhi defined "the work of creation" (ma'aseh bereshith) as natural science (hokhmathhokhmath ha-(eva') .14Sha-(eva') .14S Our author admitted his ignorance as to why men could not eat meat before the flood and surmised that permission to do so after the flood was a reward for saving the animals.149 Kimhi did not provide any original symbolic or allegorical interpre tations of the precepts which were widely used by Saadia and Ibn Ezra. Kimhi cited one of the latter's cosmological interpretations at Ps. 19:8. "Which wisens the fool" — for all connected with the sanctuary is of wonderful wisdom. Indeed the candelabra and the altars and the curtains are not a vain thing. All these things indicate that knowledge which the wise call the intermediate world (ha-'olam(ha-'olam ha-emza'i), which is in the form of the upper world and the form of the microcosm.150 (e) Philosophical Interpretation of Scripture The thorniest point of contention between the so-called rationalist and antirationalist groups in the Maimonidean controversies was 1•ני Ps. 119:104• 144 I.

The interpretation of biblical narratives and figures and philosophic truths and conceptions was known as early as Philo and became exceptionally popular among the twelfth century neo-Platonists.151 Maimonides formalized this type of exegesis with his principle that all of Scripture should be taken on two levels, the exoteric (nigleh) and the esoteric (nistar). To this he applied the verse "a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in vessels of silver" (Prov. 25:11). See how beautifully the conditions of a good simile are described in this figure: It shows that in every word which has a double sense, a literal one and a figurative one, the plain meaning must be as valuable as silver and the hidden meaning still more precious, so that the figurative meaning bears the same relation to the literal one as gold to silver. It is further necessary that the plain sense of the phrase shall give to those who consider it some notion of that which the figure represents, just as a golden apple overlaid with a network of silver, when seen at a distance or looked at superficially, is mistaken for a silver apple, but when a keen-sighted person looks at the object well, he will find what is within and see the apple is gold. The same is the case with the figures employed by prophets. Taken literally, such expressions contain wisdom useful for many purposes, among others for the amelioration of the condition of society . . . Their hidden meaning, however, is profound wisdom, conducive to the recognition of real truth.152 Yet Maimonides only stated a program but did little to expedite it. The Guide records some instances of the reading of contemporary philosophical concepts into the text of the Bible but Maimonides preferred to allude to an inner meaning and let his reader find it for himself.153 It was left to his followers and disciples to bring this method of exegesis to fruition. Samuel ibn Tibbon, Joseph ibn Aknin, Jacob Anatoli, the anonymous Peraqim ba-hazlahah and others in the thirteenth and following centuries eagerly developed the esoteric exegesis of the Bible.154 On the other hand, those who opposed the encroachment of Greek wisdom and science on the traditional curriculum were incensed at what was to their minds a desecration of Scripture, the sole purpose of which was "to keep Torah in accord with the custom of the world ISI L.

The earth cannot bear them to dwell together as two women, for the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian."155 The statement of the traditionalists that the Scriptures "do not have their place like a thief in the underground passage of allegory"156 reflected more than a defense of the integrity of the Bible, for the theory of the double meaning of Scripture bore with it an implicit exclusiveness by which only the enlightened, only those learned in philosophy, could reach the true intent of divine revelation. The Maimonideans for their part were not insensitive to the reac tion against this method of treating the biblical text. Samuel ibn Tibbon, a leading representative of the Maimonideans and a close friend of David Kimhi's, admitted: I do not agree with Maimonides' apparent opinion that the true intent of the entire Torah, or let us say, the principal part of it, is to provide the sages with allusions to true reality by means of esoteric meanings and secrets. On the contrary, I say that the intention of the Torah is to benefit the masses. There were, however, certain things meant for the sages which were beyond the level of the masses. Therefore, Moses had to write those things with a double meaning, one obscuring the other — the outer meaning for the masses, the inner for the sages . . .157 Thus, having paid lip service to the popular character of the Torah, Ibn Tibbon could proceed to his task with a clear conscience. This attitude characterized David Kimhi's approach to philosophic exegesis also. In many places, our author stressed the value of the Torah for the masses by reference to the practical or moral lessons to be learned from the text.158 In his general commentaries to the Bible, meant for the uninitiated, there is hardly a trace of philosophic interpretation.159 155 Alfakhar's first letter to Kimhi, Qovez III, 2a. Cf. Sarachek, Faith and Reason, pp. 19, 76, 172 ff., et passim', Abba Mari ben Moses Yarhi, Minhath qena'oth (Press burg, 1838), pp. 31, 175. 156 Alfakhar in Qovez III, 1c. JS' Ma'amar, 132. ■s® See Talmage, Study, pp. 33 f., n. 33. 15י Metaphoric or parabolic interpretation was common, of course, but its content was not philosophic. For example, at Gen. 15:17 the 'ala(ah refers to future exiles, the smoke to God's punishment in this exile, and the torch to God's destruc tion of the nations. Again at Zech. 1:1, the four chariots refer to the four Kingdoms, as do the horns of 2:1. Going even farther, Jacob's thigh (Gen. 32:33) is taken to represent Dinah {yerekh{yerekh is feminine gender) and at Ezek. 23:3 and Hos. 2:4 the shadayim represent the two Torahs, oral and written. The panim of Hos. 2:4 represents the prophets. Cf. Isa. 5:1; Ezek. 16:3; Hos. 10:12; Rashi's introduction to Zechariah.</page><page sequence="32">208 FRANK TALMAGE [32] Thus the layman could rest content with a philological interpretation, a pertinent midrash, and perhaps a moral exhortation. Far different is the case with the two small tracts, the "secret scrolls,"160 through which Kimhi brought his "Maimonideanism" to fruition. These were the commentary to the ma'aseh merkavah, the first chapter of Ezekiel, and the ma'aseh bereshith, the Hexaemeron. While the latter commentary did not seem to be very well known,161 the commentary to the merkavah was soundly censured by contem porary and later scholars.162 It seemed as if the traditionalists felt that Kimhi's approach in the general commentary, like Ibn Tibbon's statement, was only lip service, for Kimhi clearly preferred the esoteric interpretation of Scripture as its true intent. He followed Maimonides in the latter's statement that "the account given in Scripture of the creation is not, as is generally believed, intended to be literal in all its parts."163 An illustration of this is Kimhi's approach to the account of the serpent in the Garden, which he declared to be confused in the nigleh,nigleh, but clear in the nistar. After rejecting the theories of Saadia and Ibn Ezra, Kimhi observed that the speech of the serpent was miraculous (derekh mofeth) even though a certain difficulty remained, namely that Scripture does not say "and God opened the mouth of the serpent," as it does with Balaam's ass. This, Kimhi maintained, was not crucial since "there is an important esoteric meaning, which is the principal one for those who are versed in science."164 These were invited to peruse the esoteric commentary by occa sional references to the latter in the general commentary.163 The con tents of this esoteric commentary will now be described. In the com mentary to the Hexaemeron there is, unlike the commentary on Ezekiel, very little which Kimhi shared directly with Maimonides except for a random quotation166 and the use of some midrashim.167 It is quite clear however that the Kimhian edifice rests on a Mai monidean foundation. For example, the Garden of Eden was taken as the Active Intellect "at the head of His creatures when He created the Separate In 160160 Avi'ad Sar Shalom Basila ('Emunath hakhamim [Johannisburg, 1859], LXXX1I1) stated that Kimlii had called his merkavah commentary a " 'secret scroll' (megillath setharim) since he did not wish to reveal it." 161 The first references to it were in the fourteenth century. See L. Finkelstein, The The Commentary of David Kimhi on Isaiah (New York, 1926), p. liii. 162 See below, p. 214 ff. 165 Guide 111:29■ 164 Gen. 3:1. 164 Gen. 2:8, 9, 13, 17: 3:15, 22. 166 Gen 3:6 (Guide 11:30). 167 Gen. 2:9.</page><page sequence="33">[33] DAVID KIM HI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 209 telligences." The man placed within the Garden derived his power (koah) from the Garden, just as in Maimonides the Active Intellect enables the human intellect to pass from potentiality to actuality. Further, the Tree of Life represents the human intellect while the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil symbolizes the material intellect. The former is all good in that it strives towards the Active Intellect by pursuing the divine sciences, while the latter is tainted with an element of evil because of its physical lusts.168 With these basic notions in mind, Kimhi developed his themes further. As in the Ezekiel commentary, the concept might be repre sented by different terms in the text and vice versa. For example, the Tree of Life, which in 2:9 represented the human intellect, became the science of theology (2:16) and then the divine intellect (2:17), while the material intellect was represented by Adam's rib (2:21), the human intellect by God's voice (3:8), and the Active Intellect by the Cherubim (3:24). One of the interesting things which Kimhi developed is the stress on the importance of the material intellect to the point where he claims that it was necessary that the first man eat from the Tree of Knowl edge. Maimonides made the following statement: You must understand the statement of the Rabbis: "God has never shown the Tree of Knowledge to man, nor will He ever show it." This is correct for it must be so according to the nature of the universe (leva' ha-mezi'uth mehayyev ken). Kimffi took this to mean that God did not reveal the evil which was to come from the eating of the tree because "one must concern oneself with physical needs in order to preserve the species (le-qayyem ha-mezi'uth)."169ha-mezi'uth)."169 In a like fashion, the passage concerning the need for a helpmate {'ezer{'ezer ke-negdo, 2:17) was interpreted as representing Adam's need for a component of earth (yesod 'afari) because he would not be able to survive in the material world as pure intellect. He did not find a helpmate from among the beasts, however, because they were pure earthiness ('afriyyuth) (2:20). Likewise, the sleep that was inflicted upon Adam signifies the fact that the intellect should not be alert constantly. The rib which was removed from Adam (2:21) represented the separation of the material intellect from the human intellect. At this point, the role of the material intellect was played by the 168 Cf. Gen. 2:15. 14י Gen. 3:6 (Guide 11:30). The passage is admittedly difficult but Kimhi's interpretation is apparently not what Maimonides intended. See Munk, Guide II, 252.</page><page sequence="34">[34] 210 FRANK TALMAGE woman,'70 while that of the human intellect was played by the man. Kimhi interpreted "and he brought her to the man" as meaning that the two were to be joined, though the man must control the woman so that she would not descend to the level of a beast.'71 With the appearance of the woman, then, Adam became reconciled to his earthy, hylic component and realized that his passions were natural ("bone from my bones," 'ezem me-'azamay, Gen. 2:23) and, to a cer tain extent, were to be followed. Thus, when the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge was given to Adam, the flesh which served as a partition between the two intellects was removed and he became one with the woman. This was, however, necessary for his worldly existence as was mentioned above. Kimhi's view of the woman as the material intellect (}}omer) probably derived from an interpretation of the Guide 1:6: "The term ishshah was afterwards applied to anything designed and prepared for union with another object."'72 The second main theme centers on the three sons of Adam. Ac cording to Kimhi's scheme, Cain was an agricultural worker and was somewhat bestial in relation to intellectual matters, since he con cerned himself chiefly with the acquisition (qayin&lt;qinyan) of the necessities of life. Abel was concerned with the superfluities and vanities (hevel) of life, such as silver and gold. He was somewhat better endowed with material intellect but had practically no human in tellect, since he was involved with physical passions. The third son was Seth, who ate from the Tree of Life and was created in the image of Adam. It was he who shared the human intellect. Indeed, Seth was born of another woman, for Eve had returned completely to earth. Consequently, Seth was "good seed" and the true founder of mankind. Maimonides himself had little to say on this subject. His words are: Remarkable and noteworthy is the great wisdom contained in the names of Adam, Cain, and Abel and in the fact that it was Cain who slew Abel in the field, that both of them perished, although the murderer had some respite, and that the existence of mankind is due to Seth alone. Compare "For God has ap pointed me another seed" (4:25). This has proved true.'73 Here too, then, Kimhi supplied that which Maimonides saw fit to omit. 170 Cf. Gen. 2:22. 171 Cf. Gen. 3:6. 2"־ Profiat Duran stated this explicitly a.

While Maimonides gave a bare outline and Samuel ibn Tibbon dealt with one or two problems, Kimhi could hardly contain himself in revealing a mass of detail which eliminated any attempt at unity in the composition. One need only read the introduction, which is intended to serve as an "outline" for the rest of the work, to understand this. The main feature of Maimonides' commentary on the merkavah, the meaning of the Ijayyoth and the 'ofanim, the four faces, the rider, and so forth,175 are discernible. However, where Maimonides gave "a short explanation of plain things" and relied on the reader to "obtain a perfect and clear insight into all that has been clear and intelligible" to him,176 Kimhi embellished his material with detail, some of which is extraneous. This tendency to overexplain is nowhere clearer than in his dis 14י I. Heinemann, "Die wissenschaftliche Allegoristik des jiidischen Mittelalters," HUCAHUCA 23 (1950-1), pt. 1, p. 634. Compare his statement in reference to the Song of Songs (628) : ' 'Gemâss dem Glauben an das Recht der allegoristischen Mehrdeutung schliesst die geistige Deutung den Wortsinn keineswegs aus. Ibn Esra fiihrt eine wôrtliche Deutung durch." Yet Ibn Ezra did not consider this interpretation his torically valid, i. e., it was mashma' but not pesha(. He said that the "only true [interpretation] is that which the Rabbis transmitted," i. e., the allegory of God and Israel. Heinemann himself admitted that Maimonides did not take all the Genesis narratives literally. Heinemann's discussion is largely academic. As he himself stated, there was no specific Hebrew term for allegory. Allegoria and the Hebrew equivalent of spiritualiter {ruhanith){ruhanith) were known and used by Kimhi himself, but these terms were applied exclusively to Christian allegory, a type of exegesis apparently considered sui generis. The term mashal on the other hand could be applied to an anthropomorphic expres sion, a prophetic allusion, or a lengthy esoteric explanation. The terms liidah and remezremez were also used, especially for prophetic obscurities. Cf. W. Bacher, Ha RaMBaMRaMBaM parshan ha-miqra (Tel Aviv, 1932), pp. 19 f., n. 6. Kimhi used the ex pression derekh mashal at Hos. 13:8; 14:7, 8; Amos 1:2, 3; 2:13; Mic. 1:3; 2:4; 6:9; Nah. 1:8; 2:13; Hab. 3:17; Zech. 10:4. Cf. Hab. 3:8: derekh mashal u-melizah. For fridah,fridah, see Micah 2:4; remez, Hab. 2:2. Cf. Gen. 15:2. The lack of precise termi nology makes it seem highly unlikely that Heinemann's distinctions can be main tained.

The great luminaries which direct the nether world move in fours for the sun moves in its course through four seasons of the year and the moon in four phases in a month. The day is divided into four periods against the four elements. Similarly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are in fours . . . In a like fashion, the government of the microcosm is related to the number four for the governors of the human body are four: the nutritive, the sensitive, the imaginative, and the appetitive. The nutritive is divided into four faculties: the ingestive, the retentive, the digestive, and the eliminative with the four qualities: heat, cold, dryness, and humidity. Item, the four humors through which the body is maintained: blood, white gall, red gall, and black gall. Item, the four prime problems: existence, what, how, and why . . . and four is the first perfect square. Again, 1+2+3+4 &gt;s equal to ten ... {u-vo yishlam ha-misparha-mispar ki me-'ehad 'ad 'arba'ah 'asarah). Behind these digressions lies the exposition of the basic theme of the work: God's providence. As we have seen, the hayyoth represent the separate intelligences which put in motion the 'ofanim. The feet {raglayim){raglayim){raglayim) are also representative of this.179 The 'ofanim serve the hayyothhayyoth and are directed through the latter by the Active Intellect as represented by the Rider.180 The rising of the hayyoth represents the apparent removal of the government (hanhagah) of the world. Maimonides' exegesis of the chapter is echoed throughout the commentary as has been mentioned and he is cited several times.181 Towards the end, Kimhi remarked: "and that which Maimonides wrote concerning the merkavah is known to those who understand it." 177 H. DeLubac, Exegèse Médiévale (Paris, 1959), I, p. 29. 178 Guide II :10. 179 179 Cf. Guide 1:28. 180 The fyashmal apparently represents the Active Intellect. Kimhi said that it was mentioned first since it is first in rank and last in study and perception (limmud we-hassagah).we-hassagah). He may however be referring to the Deity. Cf. Guide 111:7, where it is stated that the being over the throne is not God. 11י Gen 1:11, 19, 26, 28.</page><page sequence="37">[37] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 213 His remarks on one important question are interesting. He wrote: . . . and I, in the commentary on Isaiah, followed the path of Maimonides according to which the hayyoth are not the seraphim. Now, however, since I have revised my opinion, I must give a reason as to why Isaiah saw the hayyoth [with] four wings and the seraphim with six, while Ezekiel saw four faces on each and Isaiah saw no more than one face. Further, Isaiah reported a specific number of hayyoth, while Ezekiel did not.182 Kimhi answered that Isaiah did not see the merkavah since God's glory had not yet departed but was just "contemplating" departure. Ezekiel did not see what Isaiah saw since he was not as perceptive ('iyyun('iyyun('iyyun daq) as Isaiah. Finally, Isaiah could not give the number of the hayyoth since these creatures were incorporeal and number did not apply to them, while Ezekiel on his part did not really give a number but an "activity." Kimhi frequently developed his commentary on two levels. Since his ordinary commentary to Ezekiel 1 did not lay too much emphasis on the 'inyan, it is introduced here. Thus in addition to having sig nificance for hanhagath ha-olam, the merkavah represents the micro cosm; the fire, the burning of the temple; and the nest'ah represents the departure of God's glory. The word zafon represents Babylon, whence comes the danger to the Land of Israel, and also zafun, that "which is hidden and concealed and over which the heart of every man is agitated."183 Sometimes there are two metaphysical levels, as in the explanation of the nogah. . . . and behold the brilliance (nogah) is around, and darkness and confusion are within; and in reference to the government of the world; [we interpret as follows:] he who goes around the perplexity and contradictions and thoroughly encompasses the matter with his mind [will find] that the matter will be clear to him and he will be free of perplexity (mevukhah). With refer ence to direct knowledge (hassagah) [of God], we say: there is some knowledge, as that of the separate Intelligences which surround Him, [and that is] the nogah. To try to know Him directly, however, is to enter darkness and mist. 182 Phil. Comm. to Ezek. 1:6. !83 Word plays are a frequent exegetical device following the cryptic reference of Maimonides at the end of the Guide, 11:29• Thus in addition to zafon-zafun, nehoshethnehosheth is said to represent divining, being connected with the verb nihesh, (Zech. 1:11;1:11; 6:1) and 'egel is used instead of shor, according to Kimlii, because of its simi larity to 'agol, an indication of circular motion.</page><page sequence="38">214 FRANK TALMAGE [38] Reactions Reactions to and Evaluations of Kimhi's "Philosophizing י Almost immediately upon the publication of his commentaries, Kimhi was censured for his liaison with philosophy. His adversary in the controversy over the writings of Maimonides, R. Judah Alfakhar, criticized him of course for "ignoring the debates of Abbaye and Rava and trying to ascend on the Chariot." More explicitly, he rebuked Kimhi for making the Torah an example (mashal) and a reproach in most of its matters and it has covered its face lin shame]. Many have stood with smooth-talk (halaqlaqoth) on the rock of controversy. He went abroad and said that the great portents and miracles were riddles and parables (hidoth u-meshalim). He mocked and there was no one to call his shame. Indeed he has counselled without wisdom, suspending the Torah on nothingness. He has sold all his precious pearls and verses to the Greeks ... in order to remove them from the border which the first generations fixed. Let Kimhi whose name shows his fruitlessness (zemah beli ya'asehya'aseh qemah, Hos. 8:7), tell when the Holy Scriptures were given to interpretation according to Greek rules of hermeneutics so that they may walk back on themselves. Thus does Aram guide Ephraim and does a chariot go forth from Egypt. This must not be, for from Zion shall the Law go forth and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.184 Another contemporary, Moses ben Nahman (Nahmanides), indirectly criticized Kimhi when he labelled certain interpretations that the latter shared with Maimonides and Ibn Ezra as being those of the "devotees of literalism" (Gen. 2:17) or "those of little faith" (Gen. 11:1).11:1). Kimhi was specifically censured for publishing his Ezekiel commentary and for allowing his rationalism to destroy his respect for rabbinic literature. Concerning the former, Jacob Emden, in his MigdalMigdal 'oz, remarked: The Master (Maimonides) did well when, after beginning to explain the merkavah, he left the matter and said nothing of it it. . . but his disciples the philosophers would not follow his example. The immoderate David Kimhi is such a one as these. In his commentary on Ezekiel he endeavored to ascend on the chariot and to enter the hidden orchard (pardes) . . . This proved to be his downfall. He should have feared the penalty for revealing hidden matters, matters which the prophet con cealed . . .185 184 Qovez III, 2b-c. '85 Migdal 'oz (Zhitomir, 1873), p. 46.</page><page sequence="39">[39] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 215 Lest we think that with this last phrase Emden acknowledged the correctness of Kimhi's interpretations though blaming him for pub lishing them, we are told that they fall into the category of "vain absurdities which one may read in the privy." Similarly, Avi'ad Sar Shalom Basila remarked in his 'Emunath hakhamim that Kimhi's commentary was nonsense and should in part be burned "for Ezekiel did not want to teach us medicine or philosophy."186 David ibn Abi Zimra also remarked that one can learn nothing of the ma'aseh merkavahmerkavah from Kimlji's commentary.187 It is significant that these writers singled Kimhi out for their criticism when there was a host of philosophical commentators on Scripture in Kimhi's own time and after. It seems that Kimlji was the scapegoat because he was one of the first, if not the first, of the post-Maimonideans to write "allegorical" commentaries to Scripture in the style of Maimonides,188 but with much greater elaboration and detail than Maimonides. Kimhi was therefore a pioneer in the field of the Maimonidean type of philo sophical exegesis, and his critics may have held him somewhat re sponsible for later activity in this area. Kimhi was called to account for contradicting the words of the rabbis in certain matters. For example, the traditional interpretation of the Hebrew word selah is "forever," and the word was equated by the rabbis with nezah and wa-'ed.1*9 Kimhi's own interpretation was that selah was a musical notation used in hymnic literature in general.190 Concerning this, Avi'ad Sar Shalom Basila wrote: Now the wording of the blessing "we thank you" (in the Eighteen Benedictions) is "and all who live will thank You, selah . . . the God Who is our deliverance and help, selah." [This reading is shared by] all the communities in all the dispersions of our exile, and consequently there is no doubt that it was enacted by Ezra, who was a skilful scribe, and his court. David Kimhi thought himself wiser than the men of the Great Assembly and the sages of the Mishnah, and he deemed that all Israel err in their prayers. Now he did not hear this from his teacher, nor did he hear it from anyone else, but [he said what he did] only to follow the apparitions of his own mind and his own inventions as is the way of the philosophers.191 Basila further expressed his astonishment at how a "holy mouth" could express such views as that which Kimhi advanced concerning 186 'Emunath hakhamim, 83a. 187 Teshuvoth li-leshonoth ha-RaMBaM, 11:37• 188 L.

This accusation first levelled at Kimhi by Judah Alfakhar was not entirely justified. To be sure, Kimhi did reject many rabbinic interpretations, but, as we have seen, he also incorporated many into his writings and frequently followed them. That Kimhi's critical attitude towards rabbinic interpretations was not necessarily due to his study of philosophy is clear from the fact that Rashi and Rashbam, among others, who never read a philosophical work, shared such a critical attitude. Kimhi's dramatic experience in the Maimonidean controversy towards the end of his life helped to confirm his image as a staunch rationalist and adherent of the philosophers. Yet when we analyze the criticism aimed at him we find that it is based entirely on Kimhi's merkavahmerkavah commentary, a work which represents a mere fraction of his entire literary output. As we have seen, Kimhi utilized science and philosophy as an aid to exegesis in his commentaries, but never outside the philosophical commentaries did he allegorize or otherwise impart a "rationalistic" tone to his writings in the fashion of a Jacob Anatoli or a Joseph Ibn Yahya. In the words of S. D. Luzzatto: He did not write in a perfunctory or hasty manner, as did certain authors who subscribe to Greek and Arabic methodology and whose sole intent is to write as much as possible, whether to make a profit or for love of vainglory. Kimhi was not like these. Even though he studied Greek and Arabic science, his heart and soul, his method and wisdom were all cast in a Jewish mold. All his books and his words are faithful testimony to his humility, straightforwardness, and moderation.194 Ironically, this restraint of Kimhi's in the use of philosophic material had at least one critic too. In the twenty-eighth canto of his Mahbaroth, Immanuel ben Solomon of Rome relates that after having reached Paradise, he was presented to the various biblical authors including King David who '־י Ibid., 33a. 'ני Ibid., 32a. A perusal of the Keli yeqar will in fact show that Laniado uses Kimtii for support and elucidation far more than he criticises him, and that he himself rejects rabbinic midrashim when necessary. 1י« Kerem itemed 5 (1841), p. 27.</page><page sequence="41">[41] DAVID KIMHI AND THE RATIONALIST TRADITION 217 sent one of those present to call all the exegetes who interpreted the Book of Psalms and to bring their commentaries. Then they all came at King David's command with David Kimhi at their head . . . David said to the exegetes who were standing before him: "Let each of you recite . . . [Ps. 68], revealing its content and mysteries as you see it."195 Immanuel's placing of Kimhi at the head of the group of com mentators testifies to the esteem in which Kimhi's Psalms commentary was held. However, the scene does not end at this point, for Immanuel continues: Then they all rose, each expounding as he saw fit. Then David said: "One says: 'This is my explanation,' and another says: 'This is my innovation,' but there is no comforter among you to restore my soul."196 We are then informed that King David spots Immanuel and recognizes him as the true interpreter and revealer of the Book of Psalms. Obviously then, King David-Immanuel, in contradiction to the popular opinion, did not think that Kimhi's commentary left nothing to be desired. The question arises then, as to how Immanuel found Kimhi's commentary deficient. A look at the former's own com mentary will provide the answer. Immanuel's exposition of the sixty eighth psalm begins with a literal explanation which in tone and content is quite similar to those of Kimhi and Menahem ha-Meiri. There is some new philological material and there are some original remarks. Such material, however, is not sufficient to warrant a rejec tion of those commentaries which had preceded Immanuel's. Rather, Immanuel's true contribution begins with the statement following the literal commentary: This is the literal explanation of the verses in this psalm. In fact, however, this psalm, as its author testified, was composed in metaphors ('al derekh melizath ha-shir) in the manner of the Song of Songs, of which not one word is to be taken literally. Therefore its author goes to great lengths to express the in tended meaning in allusions far from the literal meaning. Following this statement, there comes a lengthy exposition in which the psalm is explained as an account, inter alia, of such subjects as the knowledge of God, creation, the nature of the angels, the various parts of the universe, the planets, the spheres, etc., all couched in recondite philosophic terminology. Immanuel saw fit to interpret other psalms 1«s Majibaroth 28. 16י Mafrbaroth 28.</page><page sequence="42">[42] 218 FRANK TALMAGE in this fashion also. Psalm 45, for example, allegedly describes the superiority of the intellect over the faculties of the soul. This particular interpretation of Psalm 45 is found in various forms also in the pseudo Maimonidean Peraqim ba-hazlahah, the Malmad ha-talmidim, and the commentary of Menahem ha-Meiri. In the fifteenth century too, philosophical commentaries such as that of Joseph Ibn Yahya on the Psalms made their appearance. The latter, for example, understood the sixty-eighth psalm as an exposition of the functions of the four souls of man in praising God. It is clear then that for the philosophizers, Kimhi's psalm commentary at least was quite as deficient as the Hexaemeron and Ezekiel commentaries were excessive in the eyes of the rationalists. Similarly, we find that just as Nahmanides had criticized certain interpretations brought by Kimfii as being too rationalistic,197 Gersonides found other interpretations of Kimhi's not rationalistic enough. The latter endeavored to prove that biblical miracles do not involve a change in nature, and wrote at length against the views of those, including Kimfii, who accepted miracles as ex traordinary supernatural phenomena.198 Disregarding the prejudices of either of these two approaches, it must be recognized that Kimhi, as in other aspects of his exegetical activity, followed the path of moderation. To be sure, our author was sympathetic to philosophical speculation, and especially to the Maimonidean variety. It is true also that he attempted to promulgate these views by infiltrating his texts, almost nonchalantly, with state ments reflecting them. Yet, with the possible exception of his two esoteric commentaries, he did not seek to make the Bible the hand maiden of philosophy but rather he remained faithful to his primary purpose, the elucidation of Scripture.* 1.7 See above, p. 214. 1.8 Comm.
