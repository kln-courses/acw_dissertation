Neither a child nor a work of art talks very much to a person who wants to do all the talking, especially to a person who regards it as an opportunity or an excuse for "showing off." The person who coos, or basks, or who simply has to rearrange the small boy's tie and clean his ears and set him to doing something other than the thing he is actually about, is apt to remain in as deep ignorance of a work of art as of the small boy-and for the same reasons. Did not Goethe once remark that if you would know how cherries taste you must ask the birds and the little children? The only way of getting a work of art to sur- render to you is first to surrender yourself to it, which is little more than a variation of the ancient adage that whosoever would find himself must first lose himself. As one remembers the final word in the wisest of all books about fishing, it was the behest of the greatest of all fishermen for souls "that ye study to be quiet." Little advice of greater value can be given to the person who would know works of art. There is much talk in the world about taste and the necessity of inculcating good taste. If we think it out carefully we cannot help discovering that when a person has actually learned to see and, trusting the evidence of his sight, to see through the eyes of others, he has no call to think about taste, either good or bad. If, as maintained above, acquaintance with art is only to be obtained as a wholly personal and very great adventure, taste falls completely out of the picture-for it is impossible to think of a great adventure as being in good or bad or any other kind of taste. Thus the person who undertakes to tell another what he should experience in the presence of a work of art, so far from illumi- nating it, hides it under his cloak. The man or woman who takes another's word for the personal value to him or her of a work of art should remember another of Halifax's remarks-that "Men who borrow their Opinions can never repay their Debts." WILLIAM M. IVINS, JR. AN EARLY PAINTING BY THOMAS EAKINS A newly acquired picture by Thomas Eakins, Max Schmitt in a Single Scull,' is to be seen this month in the Room of Recent Accessions. This is the third highly notable addition lately made to the collection of American paintings, the others being the Delaware Water Gap by Inness, bought last year, and Moonlight-Marine by Ryder, bought last April. All are capital examples of our native painting at its most admirable and raciest point of development. The nationality of each of these works is unmistakable, but the bonds of relationship between them, particularly between the Ryder and the others, are hard to define- are felt indeed rather than reasoned. Inness chooses a famous show place, beloved of sight-seers, as his theme and embellishes it with a passing shower, sudden sunlight and a rainbow, and enlivenments like a steam- ing railroad train, rafts on the river, cattle, and people. Ryder, austere and visionary, paints a moonlight night with ominous roll- ing clouds and a little boat lurching in the waves which appeals to the sympathetic onlooker as an abstract of all moonlit nights at sea. Eakins goes to his back yard, so to speak, and utilizes his youthful eyesight of binocular clarity, his already unusual scien- tific knowledge of perspective and optics, and his marvelously precise craftsmanship to make a straightforward copy of a homely scene in a familiar aspect, with all its items detailed impartially. As the title states, the picture is, osten- sibly at least, a portrait. Eakins's boyhood friend Max Schmitt, an athlete and oars- man of local celebrity, is shown in his racing shell Josie on the Schuylkill River at Phil- adelphia, the precise spot being above the Girard Avenue bridge and the time a sunny autumn afternoon. The work is signed with a remarkable and inimitable signature-a miniature portrait of the artist himself, seen rowing at good speed and in excellent form (he too was a trained oarsman) in the middle 1 Oil on canvas; h. 3234 in., w. 46 in.

On the stern of his boat appear the name EAKINS and the date I87I. He was then twenty-seven. He had re- turned from his studies in Europe the year before, imbued with the principles and criticisms of Gerome, his teacher at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and was living with his parents in Philadelphia. He had come back well equipped and skillful, but not more so, noticeably, than other talented students just out of pupilage. During his first year at home, however, an extraor- dinary advance in his powers took place. In personality and in craftsmanship he had become a full-fledged painter with a clearly marked style-the style he was to follow the ripples made by oars dragging on the surface of the calm water; and so were the dark spots left by the contact of cleanly dipped, rhythmical oars, where the reflec- tion of the sky on the water is momentarily disturbed. He was curious about the exact form of reflections in the water and their perspective-about all perspective in fact.2 The bridge with its ugly, intricate ironwork he found worthy of his most careful atten- tion (doubtlessly figuring out in his prac- tical way the constructive logic of its girders and braces), and he noted that on a windless day the steam from a tugboat rises vertically; that a swiftly moving boat would frighten ducks and make them fran- DETAIL OF PAINTING BY EAKINS SHOWING PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST throughout his whole career. At the age when most young artists are floundering among experiments he produced works which we consider among his most char- acteristic achievements. Our picture is one of these and perhaps the earliest in date. We look upon Eakins as an exceptionally impersonal painter who effectively hid his own emotions in the dis- passionate presentation of facts; from his letters and his recorded sayings he would seem to have considered such a program as proper for artists. But in this picture of his friend and himself rowing on the Schuylkill the painter's joy in the sport and everything connected with it, his own love of the place and the hot afternoon, are unmistakably evident. Through the picture we can see the painter himself, sturdy, downright, scien- tifically inclined, and he appears as a most admirable and dependable young man. Boats were of absorbing interest to him- he painted their portraits with the same care for construction and anatomy that he gave to Max Schmitt and himself; so were tic. Not one of the numberless details of the picture but has been conformed to logic of time and place. His minute application has extended to every inch of the canvas without in any degree lessening the large effect of the whole scene. Later on in life the artist became austere and concentrated, as is fitting in an older person, and also much more severe in color. Our newly acquired picture is the brightest of all Eakins's oil paintings as I recall them. Later works by him are greater in concep- 2 A passage quoted by Goodrich (op. cit., p. 42) from one of Eakins's lectures illustrates this care for perspective: "I know of no prettier problem in perspective than to draw a yacht sailing. Now it is not possible to prop her up on dry land, so as to draw her or photograph her, nor can she be made to hold still in the water in the position of sailing. Her lines, though, that is a mechanical drawing of her, can be had from her owner or her builder, and a draughtsman should be able to put her in perspective exactly." It is curious to compare boats by Eakins with those by Ryder. It must be confessed that Ryder's boats could float only on an imaginary sea. 152</page><page sequence="4">BULLETIN OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART tion, no doubt, and more masterly. One would not compare it to The Writing Master, The Thinker, the Lady with a Setter Dog, or the Signora d'Arza (to select only from our collection), but the variety and lustiness of this youthful work give it a particular and perhaps more gen- eral appeal.

They therefore replaced the human victim by an anthropomorphic effigy into which were inserted models of the vital organs and fluid red pigment to simulate blood. The plot and the manner of performance of the play have changed from time to time as the various Lamaist sects in turn achieved LAMAIST PRIEST ROBE A GIFT OF CHINESE AND LAMAISTIC TEXTILES Probably the most weird masked carnival to be found anywhere in the world is the Mystery Play of Tibet, popularly known as the Devil Dance, or, by the unsophisticated Tibetans, as the Dance of the Red-Devil Tiger. The latter is the name by which the play was designated before the advent of Buddhism, and the motive was apparently to expel the old year with its demons of ill luck and to propitiate with human sacrifices the war god and the guardian spirits. Under Buddhism the Lamas could no longer coun- supremacy, and it is interesting to note how cleverly the Lamaists have twisted the ritual here and there to benefit themselves under the guise of this religious ceremony. Thus the effigy, which represents the enemy of Tibet and of Lamaism and which is very properly destroyed at last, is used to con- vey to the people a vivid conception of the manner in which devils attack a corpse and to impress on them the necessity for priestly services to guard it and its soul. An accurate description of the ritual which enters into the Mystery Play is almost impossible since so few persons qualified to interpret its in- tricacies have actually seen the perform- I53</page></plain_text>
