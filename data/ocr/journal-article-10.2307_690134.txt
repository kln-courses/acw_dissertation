Medicine is in particular danger, because times of pain and fear of death "seem to call forth aspects of our mental proclivities that work at cross-purposes to logical and systematic thought" (p. 209). According to Levitt, this is but the most dramatic consequence of our intrinsic irrational, antiscientific characters. On this view, science is indeed precious and precariously holding the forces of darkness at bay. I very much doubt that Levitt can be converted from his worldview, one that I regard as leaving little room for free play of ideas and conflicting points of view. I would simply opine in this regard that science is far more robust than Levitt allows, for the very testimony he gathers for science, its undeniable successes and future prom- ise, denies his pessimistic thesis. But I will not further argue this perspective, nor defend my ultimate optimism. I will instead close by pleading for the democratic credo Levitt himself espouses. He correctly begins his essay by joining science with democracy as the mainstays of Western civilization he would champion. Science indeed grows from the same liberal tradition that spawned democracy, and the pre- cepts holding them together are the fundamental and tenacious grip of open and free discourse, an uncompromising requisite for both arenas. The untoward consequences of the Science Wars is that the rhetoric has too often become virulent, reflecting how the emotions of the disputants hold sway over their putatively rational arguments. De-escalation is in order. We require less noise and better articulation to combat the deafness that has ensued as defensive walls have grown too high and too thick. Prome- theus, bedeviled or otherwise, cannot be freed without honest brokering. Levitt might well have applied his effort to these better ends, placing himself within the discussion, not outside it.

Eileen Crist's Images of Animals is an original, insightful, sophisticated, and lucidly written analysis of the powerful role that language plays in constructing our</page><page sequence="2">390 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values understanding of animal life. Identifying three classes of writers on animal behav- ior-naturalists, ethologists, and sociobiologists-Crist examines the ways in which their respective uses of language have effectively prejudged the question of animal mentality. Language, she convincingly demonstrates, has not been neutral with respect to the question of animal mind, nor can it ever be so. Charles Darwin heads Crist's category of naturalists, and she begins her analysis with him. Darwin's anthropomorphism, she insists, was not a naive failing on his part, nor should it be understood as a simple ascription of human attributes to animals. Instead, it reflected Darwin's basic understanding of animals as subjects rather than objects. In addition, it constituted a powerful strategy for representing the essential continuity between the animal mind and the human mind. Crist goes on to explain how Darwin's use of anecdotal evidence (another of the features of nineteenth-century naturalists' writing that later writers would identify as unscientific) actually had the very positive function of underscoring the existence of individual variations, without which natural selection is unable to operate. She then follows up her analysis of Darwin with a close study of the writings of the French entomologist J.-H. Fabre and his American counterparts George and Elizabeth Peckham. Crediting these naturalists with an approach to the understanding of action that social scientists have since designated with the German word Verstehen, Crist explains how, in using the everyday language of human life, Fabre and the Peckhams effectively grasped and conveyed the subjective meaning of the activities of the ani- mals they observed. The ethologists Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, Crist proceeds to show, replaced the naturalists' language of action with a language of behavior. In their accounts of behavior, the animal is no longer the agent of its actions. Rather, it is pushed and pulled to perform the behavior that it does. "Releasers," "innate releasing mechanisms," "action-specific energies," "fixed action patterns," and so on become the important determinants of animal activity. Analyzing a passage from a 1950 paper by Tinbergen, Crist astutely observes how the passage conjures "a picture of animals as natural objects, guided by forces they can neither know (physiological factors) nor control (environmental stimuli).... In virtue of the work of a technical language, meaning is thus transferred from the purview of the actor to the theoretical categories that are designed to explicate its behaviors" (p. 94). Taking up next the idiom of the sociobiologists, Crist provides a supple and insightful examination of the economic language so central to sociobiological think- ing and sociobiologists' concomitant use of social category concepts such as class, kinship, nepotism, altruism, and so on. While pointing out that a focus on the calculus of genes is negligent of the whole issue of the life worlds of animals, Crist notes that sociobiology nonetheless tends to reconfirm Darwin's sense of the continuity of ani- mal and human life. After thus characterizing the different linguistic practices of naturalists, etholo- gists, and sociobiologists, Crist devotes a particularly elegant chapter to the contrast- ing ways that naturalists and ethologists have represented animal courtship. Com- paring Julian Huxley's account of the courtship behavior of the great-crested grebe</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 391 with Niko Tinbergen's account of the courtship of the black-headed gull, Crist notes that "while Huxley's grebes perform their courtship rituals, the sequence of mating displays is something that happens to Tinbergen's gulls." This characterization is wonderfully apt, and the analysis here effectively underscores Crist's general claim that the choice of any linguistic idiom has consequences that are "never impartial with respect to animal mentality" (p. 185). Throughout the book, Crist dees a masterful job of analyzing how language func- tions in the writings of different observers of animal behavior. Historians of science should be advised, however, that what Crist does not set out to do is situate those authors in their respective historical contexts. For the most part, this does not pose any problems. Still, at least a couple of issues do arise. One stems from the fact that Crist's typology of naturalists, ethologists, and sociobiologists does not necessarily sort her actors out in ways that would have seemed most meaningful to them. Tinbergen, for example, was unquestionably an ethologist, but he at the same time self-consciously identified himself as a naturalist. Indeed, Curious Naturalists was the title he gave to the popular book in which he recounted the research he and his students had con- ducted. Furthermore, he believed his own field research helped prove that the natural- ist deserved a place at the very center of the life sciences rather than somewhere off on the margins. A second irony with respect to Crist's analysis is that it tends to do to the etholo- gists what she claims the ethologists' use of language does to herring gulls and greyling butterflies; namely, it deprives them of agency. If ethologists write in such a way that "behaviors emerge as events that happen to animals, rather than as active achievements," it seems that the ethologists, in Crist's analysis, are not the masters of their actions either. Rather, they end up impelled to positions skeptical of animal men- tality because of the language they employ: "Mechanomorphism is an unintended effect of a technical-causal language" (p. 203). But Crist only asserts this; she does not demonstrate it. And Tinbergen's case suggests that things may have developed for him the other way around. Certainly, by the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was com- mitted to "desubjectifying" the science of animal behavior. He contrasted his "objectivistic" science of ethology to the approach of his countryman, the animal psy- chologist J. A. Bierens de Haan, who believed that the subjective experience of ani- mals was necessarily animal psychology's primary concern. Later, in the 1950s and 1960s, as ethology became more secure as a scientific discipline, Tinbergen continued to believe that the future of his field depended on its ability to maintain a strictly objec- tive approach to animal behavior. This included leaving questions of animal subjec- tive experience aside. He made this clear to his students at Oxford, impressing upon them, at the same time, the importance of using language carefully. It is instructive to note that one of these students was Richard Dawkins, and that later in his own book The Selfish Gene, he allowed that the phrase "survival machine," although his own, could well have been Tinbergen's. These comments are offered not as a criticism of Crist's primary conclusions but, rather, as a historical supplement to her incisive and stimulating analysis of the role of language in the representation of animals. Whether or not the mechanomorphic</page><page sequence="4">392 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values portrayal of animals was an "unwitting" consequence of the ethologists' use of tech- nical language, as Crist suggests, her overall argument about the nonneutrality of lan- guage in representing animal behavior is totally convincing. This is an intriguing and important book, very much worth the attention of all those interested in how language shapes the way we think, and how, as human minds approach the subject of animal minds, anthropomorphism may have something going for it. -Richard W.
