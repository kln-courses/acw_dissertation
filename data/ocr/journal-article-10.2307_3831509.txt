Emory, Elliott, General Editor; Martha Banta, Terence Martin, David Minter, Marjorie Perloff, Daniel B. Shea, Associate Editors. COLUMBIA LITERARY HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Columbia University Press, 1988. 1263 pp. $59.95. The cover is blue, like the old Spiller Literary History of the United States (1948), and the heft and weight of the new volume and the old are about the same; but there the resemblances end. Although approximately fifty persons contributed to the old Literary History, a small core of six or so were credited repeatedly, chief of whom was Spiller himself, who supplied in his own pieces and through his editorial presence a consistency of purpose and a pervasive tone of authority. By contrast, the new Columbia Literary History is authored by six dozen scholars-each with one chapter apiece-while the editors themselves have evidently abstained from any actual writing and have also deliberately not rewritten any openings or closings for continuity. The new Elliott history speaks self-consciously for a new generation, but a generation lacking the advantage, or rather the disadvantage of consensus, for this is a project that is "modestly" but assertively "postmodern": it acknowledges "diversity, complexity and contradiction," and "foregoes closure as well as consensus." We are told, in fact, that the history is "not an authoritative proclamation," that its goal is to letdiverse voices speak, even contradict one another; that the essays are "personal"; that "it is no longer necessary or desirable for the critic to argue that one reading is truer than any other"; and that by using the index and piecing together the various discussions of key figures "the reader of this work will always be involved in an act of creating his or her own interpretations of the literary history of the United States." One begins reading such a volume-modeled, as it seems to be, on the create-your-own ice cream parlor-armed with a slight degree of skepticism, but with a sense of high adventure as well and alert for signs of generational change. And, not surprisingly in our age of canon consciousness and market 187</page><page sequence="2">G-1 REFERENCE AND BIBLIOGRAPHY fluctuations, some of the major indicators have indeed shifted place somewhat. Thus, looking at the modern period especially, in which Spiller offered separate chapters on James, Adams, Robinson, Dreiser, and O'Neill, Elliott features discussions of James and Adams, as well as of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Stein (combined), of Pound and Eliot(paired), of Williams and Stevens (paired), and of Frost and Faulkner (individually considered). But the most notable difference between the old and the new is the striking expansion of the canon, not only incorporating scores of minority writers and women not only as part of the discussion of mainstream movements, but also in valuable separate chapters that focus on logical groupings of figures. (Not all minorities are given place here, however: Hispanic American literature, for example, is represented solely by Mexican-Americans.) And the composition ofthe contributors has correspondingly changed: from the all but uniformly male Spiller volume to the much more balanced Elliott. Other signs of change, not to mention "complexity and contradiction," are also evident. Befitting its new historicist emphasis, the Columbia volume deliberately tries to place literature within the largest context of social and intellectual currents, and essays by Charles Molesworth and DonaldMcQuade are especially valuable in this regard. Yet interestingly-given the historicist emphasis of the volume-several of the writers on minorities insist that the literature not be considered merely in its social context; that the formal accomplishments of thewriters be allowed to stand as a partof literary history apart from the social significance of the work. Another persistent effort is to allow the sheer diversity of writing to stand in all its heterogeneity, and several of the essays convey that diversity, although not always with an adequate sense of order. At best, as in Cary Nelson's chapter on "The Diversity of American Poetry," there is both order and flexibility, with Nelson presenting Modernism "not as a single coherentdevelopment, but as a shifting mixture of alliances and rejections,innovations and counterreactions." Although the history is neatly divided into five major time periods, each of which begins with a general overview, the organization of the sections differs from one period to the next, giving emphasis to what is significant for each broad unit. But placement is not always a sure guide to content. Thus, the discussions of minority literature within the modern period (1910-1945) deal primarily with contemporary examples; and there is redundancy in the post- 1945 section as a whole, with "the present" receiving agood deal of emphasis throughout. Still, it is good to have these different perspectives and various sortings of the contemporary period, and this section makes the Columbia History uniquely valuable. The most serious editorial failure of the Columbia volume is the complete absence of bibliographies. The editors promise in the chapters "an overview from which readers may move to other sources," but the mentioned sources are almost exclusively primary materials, visible as part of the ongoing discussion. There are no footnotes, no separate listings of secondary materials or primary texts. "The prodigiousvolume of scholarship ... in recentyears has made the inclusion of even a selective bibliography impractical," the editor explains. Spiller had, of course, a separate bibliographical volume, to which 188</page><page sequence="3">Elliott refers us, along with the annual bibliographies of PMLA and American LiteraryScholarship; butSpiller also had a useful bibliographical essay atthe end of the history volume. "Impractical" as it may have been to create a selective bibliography, it would have been immensely practical-for the reader-to have one included in the volume. At times polemical (see Robert Stepto's provocative essay on Afro- American literature), at times lucid and incisive (seeJ. Hillis Miller on Stevens and Williams), at other times broadly informative and insightful (and even, God forbid, authoritative), the Columbia Historycontains enough good essays to make it a significant addition to the reference shelf; butdon'tthrowSpiller out yet. MDO Fried, Lewis, ed. HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN-JEWISH LITERATURE: AN ANALYTICAL GUIDE TO TOPICS, THEMES, AND SOURCES. Greenwood Press, 1988. 552 pp. $65. No longer quite the vital topic it once was in the United States-although increasingly becoming of interest in Europe-American-Jewish literature (sometimes known as Jewish-American literature) has by now had its guidebooks, its many studies of individual authors, its critical overviews. This text, consisting of eighteen essays by varied hands, assumes the subject's significance and endeavors to provide an historical and cultural synthesis for a general audience. Although one could always argue with some of its unspoken premises (which appear at times to value historical over critical concerns: is any writing by a Jewish writer Jewish in nature? If not, why pay so much attention to Meyer Levin and Ludwig Lewisohn as "major authors" of their time? if so, why isn't there more of Mailer here? and what of writing about Jews by non-Jews?); butthis in noway diminishes the substantial worth of this book. In addition to the expected essays on fiction, poetry, drama, and autobiography written in English, it offers three readings of Yiddish culture in America and two of Holocaust writing. Perhaps of greatest interest to the general reader are Sanford E. Marovitz's "Images of America in American- Jewish Fiction" and Arnold Jacob Wolf's "Makers of a Modern American-Jewish Theology."

The well known ALS Annuals are bibliographies encased in a narrative, overlapping to a certain extentwith PMLA listings, on the one hand, and JML reviews and listings, on the other.

The 1986Annua/also includes surveys of Eastern European, French, German, Italian, and Japanese commentaries. The value of such an approach is obvious, its major drawback perhaps less so: the format promises objectivity, but some of these essayists (Jerome Klinkowitz, for example) are so closely identified with a particular approach that their objectivity may at times be suspect.

Gale Research, Inc., 1989. 484 pp. $64. "The purpose of CABS," we are informed in the "Plan" of this volume, "is to provide a guide to the best critical studies about major writers: to identify the uses and limitations of individual critiques, and to assist the user with the study of important writers' works." To this end, each entry is prefaced by a primary and secondary bibliography of works by and about the author (the playwright, in this case), which then is taken up with a long bibliographical essay in which checklists, interviews, books, articles, and reviews are categorized and briefly summarized. Although the contributors are obviously advocates of the writers' work, the essays are, generally, as objective as scrupulosity can devise. The only problem with the volume, at least as I see it, is its choice of "major writers." Seventeen are included: Edward Albee, Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), Lorraine Hansberry, Beth Henley, Adrienne Kennedy, Arthur Kopit, David Mamet, Carson McCullers, Arthur Miller, Marsha Norman, David Rabe, Ntozake Shange, Sam Shepard, Megan Terry, Wendy Wasserstein, Tennessee Williams, and Lanford Wilson. Few would dispute the presence of Albee, Shepard, Mamet, and Rabe--but Carson McCullers? Megan Terry? The former has two stage plays to her credit; the latter has, for the last fifteen years, written principally for a theater in Omaha (which has bravely published her plays). Commendably, the editor has obviously gone to pains to represent women and black writers on something like equal parity with the white men. But (probably since the volume's conception) the theater scene has shifted significantly. August Wilson has become an importantvoice, as has David Henry Hwang: neither of course appears in the volume. (Where, speaking of Hwang, are the other minorities-the gays, for example, or the Hispanics? And where is Robert Wilson?) But so shift the winds of fortune. Maybe Sharon Friedman will convince her readers that the fortunes of Lorraine Hansberry deserve a change, and maybe Wendy Wasserstein will write something that truly earns her a place here. We will have to wait-for the next edition-and see. RFS Sarkissian, Adele, ed. CONTEMPORARYAUTHORS AUTOBIOGRAPHY SERIES, Vol. 6.

In her study of women's diaries from 1599 to the present, Blodgett argues that "The diary, by its nature as a genre of personal record, by the opportunity it affords the diarist to record what is important to her, and by the daily time that itclaims for itself, counters the patriarchal attack on female identity and self-worth." She warns readers, however, not to impose current feminist assumptions on past diarists, who generally upheld traditional values, even 193</page><page sequence="8">G-2 LITERARY HISTORY when registering discontent. Still, one infers, they offer contemporary feminists a chronicle of otherwise unobserved lives. As Blodgett remarks: "The diarist . . . has . .. momentarily freed herself from being an object in a male-dominated world rather than a subject in her own right. She has . . . shown ... the tenacity of the human desire to matter personally." In sum, this work offers a wealth of information, perceptive analyses, and a generous bibliography. Diane McManus Brad bury, Malcolm. NO, NOT BLOOMSBURY. Columbia University Press, 1988. 373 pp. $27.50. It is impossible to think of Bradbury the critic without thinking also of Bradbury the novelist. "There was a time when the marriage of writer and critic was extremely close," he writes, and we understand that he has endeavored in his own career to reconstruct this, "as we say nowadays, symbiotic" relationship. And so we read with special interest his reading of The History Man, and we recognize that his extended essays on Waugh, Lowry, Compton-Burnett, Angus Wilson, Kingsley Amis, Murdoch, Spark, and Fowles (along with a series of shorter reviews) are similarly informed by his experience as a novelist. Bradbury reads the works of other novelists with a rare sympathy. He functions also, to a surprising extent, as a literary historian, detailing to his informed but non-professional reader the major deeds of the twentieth- century English novel. An admirer of the great Modernists, he assumes that the "post-modern" is really a continuation of that age, now past. He insists that English fiction in our time-from the conservative rebellion of the 1950s down to the present-is far more distinguished than most critics have been willing to acknowledge. He is sympathetic to Cooper and Snow, the leaders of that rebellion, and admits his own debt to the former (although he never seems to note quite how badly they write). He is, throughout, judicious and all-embracing. My only complaint is with his gratuitous title, drawn from Lucky Jim. For this book has nothing to do with Bloomsbury or Woolf, yet readers of Bradbury's earlier essays will inevitably recall his condescension toward them. It seems an ungracious aside in so otherwise generous a book. MPL Dawson, Carl. PROPHETS OF PASTTIME: SEVEN BRITISH AUTOBIOGRAPHERS, 1880-1914. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988. 258 pp. $29.50.

A significant translator, editor, and poet in a surrealist-expressionist and ethnopoetics mode has framed a major modern tradition by this anthology: poems which, neither traditional nor experimental, "receive the abyss" and "conduct chaos" in major ways. Eshleman calls this tradition of modern work by a double name: both Abstract Romanticism and Grotesque Realism. As poet and translator, he does not wince from the extremes of poetics and language represented in this collection. Long committed to internationalist frames in poetic practice, Eshleman has made a book which represents a world-comparative synthesis of Modernism, including French, Peruvian, Caribbean, and Czech writers. His translations of Vallejo and C6saire have won special honors; all the translations are significantly well done, exciting and challenging in English. Eshleman has done special studies of the poetic career and of the responsibilities of writing long poems, and his biographical introductory remarks on each writer touch on these topics.

University of Iowa Press, 1989. 175 pp. $16.50. The set-up of this book-Moore among her contemporaries-makes some contribution to studies of affiliation and the networks poets make to support 195</page><page sequence="10">G-2 LITERARY HISTORY their production. But Goodridge has built the network to show one female figure among four males: T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Wallace Stevens because she paid "close attention" to them (never mind her close attention to H.D., Stein, Bryher, and others). Hence this is a study not of the boisterous affiliative contexts of early and middle Modernism in which Moore flourished, but a study pressured by the Modernist canon as defined in the 1970s: hieratic figures and their diplomacies. The study is based, significantly, upon extensive archival work at the Rosenbach Museum, from which Goodridge has been able to cite. Thus each of the individual chapters is an encyclopedic outline of the contacts of Moore with a specific figure, using all published reviews, marginal notes by Moore in her books, and, centrally, Moore's and the other poets' letters. Collecting all moments of contact, Goodridge's attempt to make some sense of them is helpful, but uneven sometimes (as when she does not know the work of some male poets-Pound-as well as she knows the work of others -Stevens). Her thesis concerns the centrality and necessity of strategies of self-concealment to Moore's poetic and critical activities; she discusses Moore's reluctance to assume public authority, the split between her public and private statements, the aesthetic differences between Moore and her contemporaries, and her reasons for, and means of concealing them.

University of Virginia Press, 1988. 207 pp. No price listed. What power has the model of history had for writers of fiction over the period from 1880 to 1940? Lois Hughson's answer tothis promising question begins with a detailed discussion of Henry Adams, who occupies the opening four chapters in this study. Hughson then turns her attention to writers influenced by historiographical models that had preoccupied Adams-primarily the individually-centered biographical mode and the larger-framed historical narrative. Thus, a chapter on Henry James concentrates on the historical and social model evident in such works as The Bostonians and The Princess Casamassima. Another chapter on William Dean Howells (A Hazard of New Fortunes and Annie Kilburn) shows how he fused the narrative modelled on biography with that modelled on history. Hughson turns then to Dreiser and shows through her discussion of The Financier and An American Tragedy how fiction written on the essentially nineteenth- 196</page><page sequence="11">century model of biography could subvert the moral and philosophical assumptions of that period. And finally, in a discussion of Dos Passos's U.S.A. trilogy, Hughson demonstrates the interplay of the biographical and the historical models. Hughson's individual chapters are often subtle and illuminating, and the terms she proposes for examining fiction during this period have great potential significance. But the study as a whole lacks a clear and coherent development, and the early sustained focus on Adams is not redeemed by the later discussions: allusions are made to Adams, but we get no sense of his actual influence on, or importance for, these writers. Nor does Hughson, in the discussions of the exemplary figures, give us a sense of their larger representative significance and of the fictional context beyond them. These are problems in a bookwhich is otherwise provocative and challenging. MDO King, Lynda J. BEST-SELLERS BY DESIGN: VICKI BAUM AND THE HOUSE OF ULLSTEIN.

This neat, tidy volume presents the proceedings of the 1985 conference commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the 1935 founding of the Southern Review; in it the editors imply that this development from the Southern Writers' Conference had more significance for American literature than two other, larger and more prestigious conferences held in the same year: the First American Writers Conference in New York and the First World Conference of Writers in Defense of Culture in Paris. In any case, the material offered is an importantcommentary on Southern regional writing, on Modernism, and on New Criticism. In three sections, the book covers the conception and birth of the Review, a comparison of Southern writing, publishing, and literary commerce in 1935 to those of 1985, and a commentary of Eliot's influence on Modernism and twentieth-century Southern literature, making clear how remarkable were the events leading to the founding of the Review. The commentary on the state of Southern writing and publishing is particularly insightful, covering Southern culture, book publishing-both in 197</page><page sequence="12">G-2 LITERARY HISTORY New York and by local houses, the growth and influence of university presses-and the impact of a growing number of literary journals in the South. The essays all paint a picture of a renewed, increasingly cosmopolitan culture reaching out (during a half-century) to circles of thoughtful writers and readers-erasing the colonial regionalism which had pervaded much Southern literature. In paying homage to Eliot and his influence on Modernism and the South, the editors show that he was really a transplanted Northerner (despite his birth in St. Louis) whose early life was a succession of episodes away from the South, until, finally, his assumption of British citizenship. Commemorative volumes usually memorialize an individual. But these editors had the unusual task of tracking the development of an institution-- one whose founders were still alive to recall the events of 1935 at the Review's fiftieth birthday. The book should be useful to anyone interested in Southern regionalism and its development since World War II. Richard P. Moses Todd, Janet. FEMINIST LITERARY HISTORY. Routledge, 1988. 162 pp. $37.50 cloth, $12.95 paper. Janet Todd undertakes "to provide not another introduction to feminist criticism, but a defense of the early socio-historical enterprise, together with an assessment of its likely developments and my hopes for a feminist literary history founded on its base." Nevertheless, on the way to the promised land, she provides thumbnail critiques of the major texts provided by feminist critics on both sides of the Atlantic over the past twenty years, from Mary Ellmann's Thinking About Women (1968) to Mary Jacobus's Reading Woman (1986). In so doing, she also writes a history of feminist criticism, a dialectical narrative in which early socio-historical feminists such as Elaine Showalter "rushed to generalize on the basis of too little history" and thus evoked the "mockery" of "Francophile critics" (Toril Moi, Mary Jacobus, and Alice Jardine, in particular), who are in turn mocked by Todd for putting "theory before literature and the idea of woman before the experience of women." Notsurprisingly, given the information provided by her "autobiographical intervention" that Janet Todd is British, the desired synthesis of naive American socio-historical criticism and Francophile erasure of empirical reality is a version of new historicist criticism, one grounded in the socialist feminism of such-English critics as Cora Kaplan and Michelle Barrett, who attemptto mediate materialist feminism and psychoanalytic theory by way of "a sophisticated [Althusserian] notion of ideology."

PECULIAR LANGUAGE: LITERATURE AS DIFFERENCE FROM THE RENAISSANCE TO JAMES JOYCE. Cornell University Press, 1988. 262 pp. $9.95, paper. Derek Attridge's brilliant tour de force of the relationship between language and literaturefrom the Renaissanceto modern times is beautifully written and patiently argued through an analysis of representative texts from the Renaissance, the Romantic period, and the twentieth century. The central problem involved is the extent to which literary language shares a commonality with the language of everyday speech, and what the relationship means in terms of the particular aesthetic of individual works. 199</page><page sequence="14">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS Attridge chooses George Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie to describe the Renaissance equation of nature and natural dignity with the cultivated and artificially decorous language of poetry. Art emerges both distanced from nature and imitative of it, depending on which conflicting view of the term nature is applied. For Wordsworth, in the Preface to Lyrical Ballads, poetry seeks a language which is not dependent on social and political custom or imitation, but is self-sufficient. Poetry should be in the language of real men: real language. Attridge addresses the problems of common language expressed in metric form as the utterances of real people. The next section, on Saussure's Course in General Linguistics, especially treats the problems inherent in Saussure's creation of a hierarchy privileging synchrony over diachrony, and the difficulties with one-sided arguments regarding the superiority of historical meaning of language to contemporary contextual usage. Roman Jakobson, as the major link between Russian Formalism and Prague Structuralism, provides the bridge to a lengthy discussion of Joyce as exemplar of the restof the arguments in Attridge's book. The discussion in the Jakobson chapter focuses on Joyce's extra-lexical onomatopoeic language, principally in the "Sirens" episode of Ulysses. Attridge's deconstruction of various linguistic examples in this and the following chapters produce brilliant insights both into specific passages in Ulysses and into Joyce's methodology. Attridge's two chapters on Finnegans Wake deal with language and themes in the work. The first differentiates between puns-with fixed alternatives-and portmanteau words, which shatter belief in the singleness of meaning, and thus become the avatars of contemporary critical theory. The chapter on theme takes aim at Anthony Burgess's attempts to distill simple truths form the Wake. In Attridge's words, "The mass of interlaced material makes it impossible to draw out any single thread as central-whether it be plot, time sequence, character, symbolic structure, mythic framework, voice, attitude, dogma, or any other of the threads that run through conventional novels." The Wake becomes a flagrant digression in the best sense of the term. Since literature is a digression from normal discourse, Finnegans Wake is nota digression from literature, but central to the enterprise. One can hardly do justice to Peculiar Language in a short review. The book tackles major themes in intelligent and informative ways, and must be read and digested slowly to be appreciated fully.

Blum concerns herself with a double motif prevalent in women's fiction, a male/female relation attempting to transcend traditional gender roles, 200</page><page sequence="15">but going also beyond the gender polarities inherent in the concept of androgyny. Contrasting this double to that found in men's fiction, she argues thatthe women's double results from psychic fragmentation: "both selves are complete, but through their interaction and connection they attain better awareness of both selfhood and relationship." Blum focuses on the difficulties of female bonding inherent in social structures, and on its possibilities demonstrated in more utopian realms-such as novels by the Bronte sisters, Virginia Woolf, Margaret Drabble, Margaret Laurence, Ursula Le Guin, Dorothy Bryant, and James Tiptree, Jr. HRM Boose, Lynda E. and Betty S. Flowers. DAUGHTERS AND FATHERS. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988. vii + 453 pp. Illus. $39.50 cloth, $12.95 paper. This valuable collection of new essays explores the father-daughter relationship in life and literature. The first section, devoted to the influence of Western Culture, concentrates on sociological, anthropological, and psychological aspects, with occasional references to literature. While the anthology is concerned primarily with American and British literature of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, one essay from this section also investigates the relationship in Mexican-American culture. The second section of articles-devoted to various fictional daughters-ranges from Richardson's Clarissa to Sylvia Plath's poetic persona (whose views Elizabeth Butler Cullingford contrasts interestingly with Yeats's in his "A Prayer for My Daughter"). An important contribution in this portion is Sandra M. Gilbert's essay on the recurring motif of the daughter's rejection of, and attempted escape from, paternal seduction in Eliot's Silas Marner and Edith Wharton's Summer, as well as in myth, folklore, and earlier literature. The final group of essays concentrates on the particular problems of the female artist. Of special interest to JML readers are Elizabeth Abel's discussion of Cam (To the Lighthouse) as an Antigone figure immobilized by the contrary demands of her father and her brother, and an analysis of Christina Stead's Louie Pollit (The Man Who Loved Children) by Judith Kegan Gardiner. One of the pleasures of this anthology-grounded in the contemporary theories of Lacan, Cixous, Irigaray, Foucault, Girard, Felman, Chodorov, and Eagleton-is the lucid writing style of all the participants. Lacking the distractions of modish jargon such as "ize" words ("prioritize," "valorize," "problematize," and the like), the reader can focus on the authors' provocative arguments.

After theAvant-Garde is a collection of eighteen review-essays published originally in journals such as American Scholar, Grants, American Poetry Review, and TLS. Taken together, the essays argue for what many will regard as an old-fashioned word-namely, standards. Unlike those convinced that indeterminacy wears a thousand faces, Boyers feels "it is both necessary and possible to distinguish between good art and bad art." But that said, the gathering is more than opposition, however much Boyers' resistance to certain fashions in contemporary criticism energize his essays; there is also an exploration of what"avant-garde" means in our time. As Boyers puts it: The title of my book suggests that what was once regarded as a dangerous and novel enterprise may now properly be regarded principally as a historical phenomenon, in the wake of which certain creative possibilities have been marginalized or extinguished. Though writers and artists obviously continue to make things that will strike some of us as fresh and original, the idea of a permanent avant-garde, like the idea of a permanent adversary relationship between artists and spectators, is one of the myths I have thought it useful to challenge in this collection. Boyers' "challenges" are occasioned by a wide range of creative works, critical books, and films: The Real Life ofAlexandro Mayta, John Ashbery's Houseboat Days; John Gardner's Moral Fiction, George Steiner's After Babel, and William H. Gass's The World Within the Word; as well as the films of Bergman, Goddard, and Yasijiro Ozu. Granted, the result does not make for a unified book, butwhen one writes as clearly and intelligently as Boyers does, that hardly matters. For what After the Avant-Garde presents in abundance is a survey, as it were, of what engages contemporary sensibilities, and how one might respond to such explosions of art with discrimination and taste.

Duke University Press, 1988. 181 pp. $27.95 Cohn's study of contemporary mass-market fiction for women is logically organized, compactly illustrated, and convincingly argued. Her focus is on Harlequin romances, and her argument is that the typical plot, in which the heroine wins economic power along with marriage, involves an endlessly enacted contradiction: even as love and power are gained, the romance reemphasizes woman's powerlessness by any other means than those established by the patriarchal society. Cohn explores this theme through chapters that trace the structure and elements of romance fiction, along with the origins of the formula in Jane Eyre (the source of the attractively dark hero) and Pride and Prejudice(which generously rewards true love with ample property). Building on Janice Radway's studies of the romance audience, on Frederic Jameson, and on recent feminist historical scholarship, Cohn has written a lucid and valuable study of popular culture.

AMERICAN CRIME FICTION: STUDIES IN THE GENRE. St. Martin's, 1988. 146 pp. $24.95 This series of critical essays by a group of British scholars takes a long step toward establishing the respectability of the detective fiction genre as part of Modernist fiction, a position congruentwith its popularity. The authors identify Poe, Isherwood, Hemingway, Faulkner, Hammett, Chandler, Graham Greene and James M. Cain as practioners of an "urban fiction" cutting across the usual lines separating canonical fiction and the detective story; they show how thin this line is when dealing with the "hard-boiled" detective. The essays reach well beyond the usual discussion of the genre's history and criticism to consider not only plot 203</page><page sequence="18">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS and criticism but also the linguistic qualities of the genre in America, where detective fiction has taken a somewhatdifferent, closer to the hard- boiled, course than in Britain.

Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988. 249 pp. $27. The battle of the romance in America is still engaging critical energies, to judge by Dryden's most recent book. Dryden positions himself at the outset, fully aware of the field of battle, somewhere at the center, high in an observation post, from which he can peer intensely into the open volumes of the forces on the field. Acknowledging Nina Baym's attack on the genre as an artifact of later historians and as exclusionary of women, yet acknowledging also Evan Carter's revisionary revitalization of the genre on the grounds of its rhetorical consistency, Dryden weighs in with Derrida ("there is no genreless text") and with Northrop Frye (romance is "the paradigm of all storytelling"). What he is mainly interested in is the way reading occupies a central theme in the "romance," absorbing both authors and readers in a process that is represented problematically in the narrative structures under consideration. Moving with deliberation from Waverly to The Marble Faun to Pierre to Portrait of a Lady, Dryden takes the genre beyond the nineteenth century and into the twentieth with his considerations of Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! and Barth's Letters. It is the genre-and the problem of reading that is at its theoretical center-thatoccupies Dryden, however, and the crossing of periods along the way from mid-nineteenth century to Postmodern means little to this systematic traveler. Despite a title that seems deliberately to tell us nothing, and despite the exclusion of any considerations beyond the text itself, this is a rewarding study that offers fascinating and detailed readings of its subjects.

Budapest: Akad6miai Kiad6, 1988. 235 pp. + illus. $22.50 paper. To literary theorists, this will seem old-fashioned. Its first chapter announces its Lukacsian orientation and expounds its aesthetic with an almost endearing naivet6. ("It is sufficient to think of Leonardo's paintings," Egri writes, "to realize the emotional charge that painting can have.") The ideas are simple-in fact, overly simple: Poetry stands between fiction and music from the point of view of the importance of objects and their graphic visuality. It is similar to fiction and dissimilar to music in its use of graphic verbal imagery. (And so on.) 204</page><page sequence="19">The ideology is uncomplicated and direct: "T.S.

Fortunately, once pastthe first chapter, afterwhich Lu kcs is more or less forgotten, the reader discovers a critic of sensitivity and perception. There is a chapter on Wordsworth, Constable, Hubert Parry (Ralph Vaughan Williams's teacher) thatdraws interesting parallels among the structures of their work; there is a surprisingly persuasive chapter on caricature in Picasso, Joyce, and Benjamin Britten; and there is a final chapter on "Some Modern Tendencies in Twentieth-Century Hungarian Poetry, Painting and Music," arresting if only because of the unfamiliarity of the material (with the exception, of course, of Bart6k and Kodaly).

This is a highly schematic, narrowly focused but not dogmatic reading of European Modernism, which sees itas one movementamong(and reacting against) many contemporaneous movements; Realism, Expressionism, Futurism, Symbolism and Surrealism among them. Its subject is "the small core of writerswho launched the Modernistconventions" and whose works illustrate "the Modernist code' in practice. Its discussions of these writers are intelligent if not profoundly original: Joyce, Eliot, Woolf, Mann, and Proust, but also Gide, Svevo, Larbaud, and Musil. Kafka is excluded "because his fictional writings hardly contain any metalingual (or metafictional, or metanarrative) observations."

FORM AND SOCIETY IN MODERN LITERATURE. Northern Illinois University Press, 1988. 203 pp. $27.50. In an age of theory, books that seek to consolidate or mediate or retreat to a calm middle ground are not likely to find much of an audience. When the argument is conducted in a fluid, graceful middle style, with scarcely a word that a literate reader of thirty years ago would not have recognized, such books will have an especially difficult time making their 205</page><page sequence="20">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS way in the world. Foster sorts through a variety of competing critical methods, from early formalism through Post-structuralism, bringing to each of them nothing like the agonistic stridency of much recent criticism, rather submitting each to a kind of tolerant good sense. The position he arrives at, social but not Marxist, formal but notformalist, humane but not humanist, skeptical but not deconstructionist, focuses, after a long first chapter, on some well-read works of Eliot, Faulkner, Joyce, and Yeats. Foster is in a position to moderate the excessive claims of more methodically aggressive critical works; further, his sensible eclecticism is probably not far from the implicit working assumptions of a large number of readers for whom methodological purity has no allure. Yet the unpleasant irony is that, without greater claims to originality, Foster's thoughtful and decent book will scarcely make a ripple. PTS Gilbert, Sandra M. and Susan Gubar. NO MAN'S LAND: THE PLACE OF THE WOMAN WRITER IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: VOLUME I: THE WAR OF THE WORDS. Yale University Press, 1988. 320 pp. $22.95. Gilbert and Gubar redefine Modernism in relation to the historical emergence of women's rights and of women in the public sphere, which occasioned masculinist resistance and an array of female strategies to respond to that gynophobia-responses which essentially differ by virtue of the-gender of the writers, as well as, loosely, across three periods: turn- of-the-century, High Modernist, and contemporary. The thesis "that a reaction-formation against the rise of literary women became not just a theme in modernist writing but a motive for modernism" boldly places as central a political shift and political struggle which had certainly been ignored in the dominant accounts of the crisis of the rise of Modernism. It is a major revisionary proposal which deserves to be influential, not only for its unmarginalizing of women's issues within the culture, but also because it allows a variety of literary works to be seen in a new way, and brings several underread authors (Rebecca West, George Egerton) up to scrutiny. However, the nature of the response is, according to this book, a highly polarized, even relentless, tale of "gender strife"-a "war of words," or a literary battle of the sexes, in which genders are bound apart from each other in a kind of parodic trench warfare (World War I metaphors are encouraged by this book). Certainly Gilbert and Gubar do not stint at the portraits of male sexism, male hysteria at female power, gynophobia, and revenge narratives of violence. They collect, as well, all the possible worst case narratives (representations of rape in Nathanael West; gynophobia in T.S. Eliot, incitements to violent control of women in D.H. Lawrence). Daunted by the new woman and her erotic/political energies, male writers represented startlingly punitive fantasies of aggressive revenge. Gilbert and Gubar then categorize the strategies with which women writers responded to their historical emergence and to the 206</page><page sequence="21">aggressive male fantasies: guilt and vulnerability; duplicity and subterfuge and self-destructive sacrifice for the Victorian period. Using texts by Glaspell, Woolf, Cather, H.D., Rebecca West, the authors provide detailed strategies of subverting male authority and fantasies of empowerment upon male death. In more contemporary texts (Carson McCullers is treated atsurprising length) female characters are punished and defeated, until the rise of feminist writing (which term, "feminist" is astonishingly counterpointed to the term "masculinist"). In this dichotomized portrait, the implicit scene of writing is a tragic melodrama of gender anxieties. The concentration on one metastory-the "colla[ting of] individual literary narratives" to produce this war-had two effects. First, the assumption of gender identity and gender polarization situates difference always and eternally between men and women. Differences among men are of no interest; similarities between men and women are of no heuristic value (although the World War I realization that the Germans and the English were similar might have offered a model). Differences among women are treated psychologically (not by social markers such as race, class) in the "affiliation complex"-often negative-views of female foremothers. Second, contradictions within individual authors-orwithin individual works-evidenceofdebate, tonal judgment of thematics of violence, narrative strategies, contextual specificities, self-critiques-all enactments of contradiction-are generally disregarded in favor of the metastory. The second idea of importance offered by the book, in the wake of the contribution of The Madwoman in the Attic, is the thesis that, given the achievements of (broadly) Victorian women of letters, both male and female Modernists had female as well as male literary precursors, a conceptwhich interestingly complicates the generational power struggle which the authors see atthe heart of authorial dynamics. In a controversial point, they trace the rise of (what they oddly see as mainly male) avant garde innovation to a disgust with the capture of the literary marketplace by versions of scribbling women. The general strategies which male writers used to contain female writers, however, are quite similar to a perpetual Western cultural misogyny: mythologizing, slandering them as destructive, appropriating their work, trivializing them, ignoring or evading them. It seems a case of plus qa change. The general strategies with which women writers confront female precursors are more loosely "pre-Oedipal"-with both the materophilial and matrophobic strands active-in oscillation with "Oedipal": "a paradigm of ambivalent affiliation" which intermixes anxiety and exuberance. RBD . NO MAN'S LAND: THE PLACE OF THE WOMAN WRITER IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. Vol. 2. Yale University Press, 1989. 455 pp. $29.95; In volume two, Sexchanges, of their ambitious revisionary history of literary Modernism, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar elaborate the thesis adumbrated in volume one, The War of the Words, that "the linguistic 207</page><page sequence="22">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS experiments usually attributed to the revolutionary poetics of the so- called avant-garde" are, in fact, a productof a battle of the sexes thatwas set in motion by the late nineteenth-century rise of feminism and the fall of Victorian concepts of 'femininity.'" Whereas The War of the Words laid out the theoretical parameters of Gilbert's and Gubar's account of Modernism, Sexchanges consists primarily of close readings of key texts-by Rider Haggard, Olive Schreiner, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf-selected to demonstrate the "distressing sexual competition" that, in their view, accounts not only for "the dynamics of gender difference in the twentieth century" but for its major cultural artifacts as well. At their best-as in their discussion of Chopin or Wharton-Gilbert and Gubar move back and forth between text and social/historical/intellectual context, creating richly satisfying and persuasive readings of individual texts and authors. But when they offer broad cultural analysis-as of World War I or transvestism-their binary vision of the twentieth century is disconcertingly and uncharacteristically narrow and rigid.

Following Bruno Bettelheim, Roger Sale, and Joseph Campbell, Gose discusses fantasy literature which employs animal, animal toy, and quasi- human characters. His close examination of stories by Kipling, Milne, Grahame, White, and Baum-all traditional children's fare-provides some new insights to the dynamics of the trickster figure in this type of story. However, his inclusion of Adams's Watership Down and Tolkien's The Hobbit has an unfortunate leveling effect. Although he argues that "[the authors] made up the first versions . . . for their own children," the published versions of these books certainly are designed for adults or, at least, clever teenagers. JKG Gunn, Daniel. PSYCHOANALYSIS AND FICTION: AN EXPLORATION OF LITERARY AND PSYCHOANALYTIC BORDERS. Cambridge University Press, 1988. 251 pp. No price listed. The subject of this book is not very clear. The Preface asks that the title be read as suggesting "something rather more uncertain" than "firmly demarcated . . . fences or enclosures": something "such as the limits of frontiers tentatively drawn atthe end of an exploratory journey." For Gunn intends to go exploring and eventually to show that "both areas, both practices, both discourses, literary and psychoanalytic, open possibilities 208</page><page sequence="23">of creativity; open vital, valid, mutually unexclusive ways of finding form for powerful, often troubling need or desire." Discourses and desire are the tip-offs: this is to be a "meditation," its free form licensed by the French spirits who stand behind it, on certain enabling "intertextualities." The gods are invoked-Lacan, Kristeva, Serge Leclaire, Maud Mannoni-and somewhere in the course of his text, which seems hallucinatorily interminable, Gunn picks up and mentally palpates various literary works: Kafka's "The Judgment," Celan's "Crystal," Proust's A la Recherche, Beckett's Play, Molloy, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls. The object is not to "write a book of theory" nor to "privilege" either of the "discourses" over the other. "Yetthere will be a decided tendency: to move in the direction of example-to-theory, concrete-to-abstract, text-to-idea." It is hardly surprising that the theory/abstract/idea always seems to gravitate towards psychoanalytic romance, for all of the resistance to "privilegi ng" thatGunn asserts-no more surprising than the senti mentality of that romance itself. Here is Gunn quoting Serge Leclaire on the Eve of the future: "It can be hoped that she, recognizing on the Tree of Science the fruit that makes her a woman, will know how to nourish man with her light, like a new Eve who takes her body from words rather than from his bones; and that perhaps he, taking his eyes off the clock which measures his listening, will finally realise that he will not be able to love and give each day its dawn unless, like Chronos, he devours his children."

This charming and fast-paced account of the networks of Modernist women writers and cultural workers, features Dorothy Richardson, Djuna Barnes, Mary Butts, H.D., Mina Loy, Sylvia Beach, Gertrude Stein, Marianne Moore, Margaret Anderson, Amy Lowell, Bryher, Dora Marsden, Harriet Monroe, and Harriet Weaver. The thesis and some of the apparatus are quite valuable, but the breezy style scants feminist work that might have made the book a more central contribution to Modernist studies. The thesis is telling: that the radicalism of these women's art and of their lives were interdependent. They "experimented" in both and broke simultaneously with literary and social conventions. In their lives, they struggled for independence and very often defined their lives and their choices in explicitcritiqueof conventional heterosexuality. This could take various forms: these women lived as lesbians, bisexuals, and in both promiscuous and apparently asexual relationships. They also were cultural workers (patrons, publishers, editors, owners of bookstores, as well as writers) whose contributions were crucial to Modernism, both 209</page><page sequence="24">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS formally (H.D. and the Imagist lyric) and in content (Mina Loy and sexuality). The bulkofthe book is devoted to biographical essays. Of great value is the authors' familiarity with and attention to literary archives; they draw upon important libraries and private collections, as well as interviews they conducted (for example, with Loy's daughter) for some of their information. Some striking analyses occur in their discussion of Dora Marsden and The New Freewoman, Djuna Barnes' life, Harriet Weaver and James Joyce, Amygism from Amy Lowell's perspective. But Hanscombe and Smyers show only scanty interest in textual analysis of the art works which these women produced, a real limit of this volume. The four final chapters, on periodical publication and book publication, draw a picture of professional networks and interactions, where the chapters on the lives draw a picture of personal interactions. This book, a complement to Benstock's Women of the Left Bank, makes a convenient vade mecum for an overview of Modernist literary history with women put back in. RBD Hollier, Dennis. Trans. Betsy Wing. AGAINST ARCHITECTURE: THE WRITINGS OF GEORGES BATAILLE. MIT Press, 1989. (An October book) (Orig. Publ. in French, La Prise de la Concorde, Paris: Editions Gallimard, 1974). La Prise de la Concorde, with its intense analysis of the architectural metaphors of Georges Bataille, was central in architect Bernard Tschumi's efforts to deconstruct architecture. The new edition, with a cover displaying the cathedral at Rheims in flame beneath its provocative new title, is clearly intended to expand this influence. This text is at the heart of a thoroughly Postmodern process for the production of architectural theory. Consider the critic (Hollier), who proposes to make concrete the architectural images in the work of an author who demonstrated no sustained interest in architecture other than as a symbol of power (Bataille), which is in turn picked up and promoted by an architect (Tschumi), as the underpinning for a real project which is then praised by the original critic (Hollier, in the new Introduction). Neat and self-validating, n'estpas? One hopes that the debaters stimulated by this publication will recognize its embedded assumptions. Hollier's definition of architecture as the"aesthetic componentof building," for example, (although shared by Pevsner), often has been discredited as a primitive severing of techne and poesis. Additionally, since it is hardly new to consider architecture as an expression of power, examination of previous efforts both to impose and subvert power through architecture might prove fruitful. Varying from minutely reasoned dissections of Bataille's short pieces to essays in which Hollier's and Bataille's views co-mingle, Against Architecture radiates a brilliance which will make subsequent reference to it most challenging. George L. Clafen, Jr. 210</page><page sequence="25">Hubert, Ren6e Riese. SURREALISM AND THE BOOK. University of California Press, 1988. xvii + 358 pp. $65. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the graphic artist played a subordinate role as illustrator of literary texts. By the end of the century, the artist began to move away from the mimetic, reinforcing the hermeticism of the literary avant-garde. The Cubists' integration of lettering with images destroyed the subservience of illustration, and the Dadaists completed the revolt, breaking down "the order of textual space, the conventions of lettering, and whatever might smack of literary conformism." Somewhat anticlimactically, "The surrealists," declares Hubert, "who eschewed the formalistic preoccupations of the cubists and who replaced the programmed destructiveness of the dadaists with their own constructive approach to the dream world, dealt with the book in a less revolutionary and more practical manner than their predecessors." Thus many of their creations have endured, and Hubert provides a rich and valuable introduction, placing the Surrealist illustrated book within a context of literary and art history, emphasizing the Surrealists' fascination for earlier literatures. In this, the firstfull-length study of"the unique collaborations between surrealist painters and authors," Hubert achieves her goal "not only to set up dialectical relationships between graphics and the written or printed word but also to situate and define the surrealist book in its various manifestations." She deals with a diverse range of works, including those in which the writer and artist is the same person, others in which text was created after image, and those which are not truly books, like Magritte's paintings based on Poe's tales, and "Cornell's transformation of a volume into a box, and more recently, the displacement of the book into various kinds of art objects." I find these latter materials somewhat distracting, at a remove from the important issues raised by Hubert. The diversity of her studies does not, to paraphrase Segolene Le Men, prevent Hubert from asserting "synthesizing conception[s]." Indeed, her insights reveal the complexities of this unusual art form. Thus, the "barriers that separate text from image can, at the whim of the illustrator, be abolished as though to proclaim the simultaneous merging and emergence of lettering and image." But "the visual and the verbal never completely lose their autonomy in surrealist books; indeed, their complete fusion would subvert surrealist aims." The major value of Hubert's book, however, ultimately may be her individual studies: close textual readings, in which text is both word and image, separate and combined, reinforcing and/or distorting each other, jarring the reader/viewer's expectations, creating a totally new experience. She focuses on the work of Mir6, Ernst, Masson, Arp, Bellmer, Matta, Tanguy, Lam, Dali, Magritte, Cornell, and Tamayo, and includes 157 illustrations, 38 in color. Her writing is clarity itself, her references are encyclopedic (although a bibliography would help), and her sense of detail (with concomitant insights) manages effectively "donner i voir."

University of Massachusetts Press, 1988. No further information. As the debate over what constitutes Postmodernism limps on, one issue is more apparent: Postmodernism is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. While people continue to define Postmodernism as a shattered or kaleidocopic perspective of reality in terms of whose fragmentary nature even the viewer of that reality is defined, it is not amazing that dozens of articles and books have appeared in the pastseveral years, each somehow hoping to encompass the notion of Postmodernism or, like King Kong grasping an airplane from the sky, settling for the small but finite portion of the constellated whole. Three more books join the growing ranks of particularists. Hutcheon's study of The Politics of Postmodernism deals, as might be expected, with the politically engaged dimension of art, that space which Postmodern art often projects into society as a "liminal" aesthetic bonus such as in the case of a painting of Reagan facing a photo of an anti-Reagan demonstration, the two being "connected" by a red carpet on the floor. Hutcheon is more interested in postmodernity("the designation of a social and philosophical period of 'condition.'") than in Postmodernism (something primarily describable in contrast to Modernism). The book, which is well-written, frequently discusses image and representation and has a long chapter on "Postmodernism and Feminisms." Kariel has written a readable, bumptious, and sometimes angry polemic about a tension in what he views as a failed world. He seizes examples from art, literature, politics, and popular culture to make his point, bringing together such strange bedfellows as John Updike and the Bill Cosby of a Jell-O commercial. And why not? Hierarchial distinctions have, as presuppositions of a fixed register, fallen by the wayside in Postmodernism. Ross has collected essays by fifteen authors on subjects varying from "Tales of Survival and Crocodile Dundee" to "Critical Practices in the Age of Supply-Side Aesthetics." Perhaps it is a reflection of the blasted perception we have of the Postmodern world, but somehow books like Ross's or E. Ann Kaplan's Postmodernism and Its Discontents (1988)-which provide a multi-authored and, perforce, multi-faceted 212</page><page sequence="27">picture of the world around us-are more relevant and critically satisfying than most of the single-author works on Postmodernism. We are, as it were, more aware of the key problems and drawn more deeply into the intellectual fray. Ross's book is recommended reading. ES Kaplan, E. Ann, ed. POSTMODERNISM AND ITS DISCONTENTS. London and New York: Verso, 1988. No further information. Two major preoccupations of Postmodernist analysis-thinking on the Left and the obliteration of the distinction between elite culture and popular culture-are explored in this book by ten critics. The genesis for much of the discussion lies in two Frederic Jameson essays, "Postmodernism and Consumer Society" and "Postmodernism: The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism," passages of which are reprinted here under the former title. Many of the books on Postmodernism which have appeared in the past several years seem, indeed, to have discovered their icons, images, and spaces in Jameson. They propose the co-existence of a tawdry, crumbling exterior world and a new inward-looking eclectic world (as in some modern hotel and casino architecture) which seems to mirror the very world on which it is ostensibly turning its back. Most of the essays in this book lean heavily on the popular arts as the new "language of the human condition. As with the many other works written on the topic, a puzzling question remains: if this period does notcontinuethe Romanticvision-as most of the authors claim-why does it seem to be going through so many of the same motions as did the Romantic era? Why do contemporary works display such Romantic concerns as the rejection of preordained artforms, the disruption and individualization of expression, nostalgia for times past, and the minting as if new of the images of decayed forms of a prior age (as in Piranesi's pictures of walls and towers in their state of ruin)? The contention here is that the individualization and the loss of an underlying aesthetic norm are so complete as to eliminate any sense of "belonging" in the artist/writer. As a result of the "anything goes" attitude, such a procedure as, say, parody has become meaningless (leaving only pastiche). A disintegration of this magnitude supposedly obviates even a Romantic culte du moi; but then, as some authors suggest, is the Postmodern lack of "insertion" in any given system, with, paradoxically, a commensurate loss of self, merely another element among many elements, or is it a yearning toward unification? This collection covers most of the major concerns and the problems of Postmodernism; it is an excellent introduction for students as well as a good "refresher course" for the scholar bewildered by the plethora of studies appearing these days.

Kenyon, Olga. WOMEN NOVELISTS TODAY: A SURVEY OF ENGLISH WRITINGS IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES. St. Martin's Press, 1988. 168 pp. $29.95. Because it is addressed to general readers (words such as "ideology" and "mimesis" are defined in parentheses), scholars may be tempted to ignore this brief introduction to the fiction of Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Margaret Drabble, Fay Weldon, Eva Figes, and Anita Brookner. But this a book that should concern scholars because it quietly violates the ethical code by which the scholarly community operates. Reading the chapter on Drabble, I came across two sentences I recognized: one a description of a character in The Ice Age, the other a critical comment about Drabble's treatment of religion in The Needle's Eye. Margaret Drabble wrote the first sentence, I wrote the second, yet the absence of quotation marks and footnotes would suggest that Olga Kenyon originated both the ideas and the words contained in both sentences. In the same chapter, Kenyon quotes (with appropriate citation) the following sentence from Mary Daly's Beyond God the Father: "The process of liberation involves the creation of new space . . ." Daly's actual words, on p. 40 of her book, are: "The process involves the creation of new space .. . ." The words "of liberation," which Kenyon attributes to Daly, appeared-in brackets, in my book on Drabble, in which I quoted Daly throughout the chapter on The Needle's eye. The kindest interpretation of these instances of false or non- attribution is that Kenyon is a sloppy note taker. But even if these inaccuracies are unintended or inadvertent, they render her book suspect. Worse, they threaten the collegiality by which scholarly inquiry ideally proceeds. ECR Kessler-Harris, Alice, and William McBrien, eds. FAITH OF A (WOMAN) WRITER. Greenwood, 1988. 352 pp. $39.95. This large (34 essay) volume labors under two handicaps. First, it is a selection from papers delivered ata 1982 conference. Some of the best of these have since appeared elsewhere in print-Carol Asher's on Simone de Beauvoir, Judith Scheffler's on Agnes Smedley, Jane Marcus's on Rebecca West, and Joanne Frye's on Maxine Hong Kingston, for example. Many others have been superceded by work published since 1982. Second, to the extent that the volume has a unifying focus, it is one 214</page><page sequence="29">that is not being mooted in critical/theoretical circles these days: as the conference's keynote speaker, Joyce Carol Oates, phrased it, "What is the ontological status of the writer who is also a woman?" The editors acknowledge that their book does "not reflect the scope of today's women writers" (the call for papers yielded a preponderance of essays on U.S. and Western European white women), but claim that it does "capture the mood of contemporary criticism." That may have been the case in 1982. But at a time when the prevailing mood of contemporary criticism is metacritical and theoretical, this collection of essays on individual writers (from Atwood toYourcenar) seems quaintly outdated. If conference proceedings are to reach a wide audience and spark discussion, it would seem in everyone's best interest to publish them within a year of the conference. Thesix years' lag between conference and book in this instance has turned the book into little more than a (pretty expensive) souvenir for conference participants. ECR Klein, Katherine Gregory. THE WOMAN DETECTIVE: GENDER &amp; GENRE. University of Illinois Press, 1988. No further information. In her introduction, Klein tells of her ten years spent in producing this significant work. Across that period, the detective story changed; in reflecting those changes she shows us an important insight into a sub- genre only recently brought to view: the woman detective. Working from a feminist perspective, she defines three male professionals: Sherlock Holmes, the classical detective; Sam Spade, the hard-boiled private eye; and Spencer, the sensitive, self-aware facilitator. She applies these three paradigms to the many women detectives who now grace this sub-genre and generally finds them literary failures because their authors have tried to graft female personalities onto these three prototypes. She concludes that the detective novel field, despite its massive sales across time, has yet not adapted its formulaic writing to the woman detective-its models are still all male. Klein's encyclopedic knowledge of the field makes this an important piece of criticism, both as a feminist work and as another step toward gaining serious consideration for the genre. Richard P. Moses Lang, Beryl, ed. WRITING AND THE HOLOCAUST. Holmes and Meier, 1988. 301 pp. No price listed. Mostof the essays in this volumewere originally presented as papers at a conference sponsored by the State University of New York at Albany, "Writing and the Holocaust" (1987), including a summary roundtable discussion by Raoul Hilberg, Cynthia Ozick, Aharon Appelfeld, and Saul Friedlander (on historical writing), Philip Hallie (on ethical ambivalence during the Holocaust), James E. Young (on documentary fiction), Terrence Des Pres (on, yes, laughter in Holocaust fiction), and Leslie Epstein (on writing about the Holocaust). In addition, essays by Irving Howe and George Steiner, published previously elsewhere, are included. The result 215</page><page sequence="30">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS is a remarkably diverse and rich collection, straddling literary, historical, and philosophical issues, yet one in which nearly all the contributors, having already substantially written on the Holocaust in some fashion, have taken the opportunity to reflect on the more general problems involved in their labors. "After Auschwitz," said Adorno, "to write a poem is barbaric." That remark, and its full implications, haunts a good many of the commentators, yet in the end it seems no more barbaric than not to write, not to remember. MDO Lee, A. Robert, ed. FIRST PERSON SINGULAR: STUDIES IN AMERICAN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. Vision Press/St. Martin's Press, 1988. 250 pp. $35. First Person Singular, containing ten essays on American autobiography, is an all-British production in the "Critical Studies Series." The plan of this intelligently conceived volume is to offer essays on both the standard authors and on authors presently on the margins of literary discussion. The arrangement is chronological, with essays on Puritan autobiography, on Edwards and Franklin, on the Transcendentalists, on Henry Adams and Mark Twain, and on Henry James; these are followed by four essays that are rather more wide-ranging in their coverage, dealing with writings by women, with the Afro-American tradition, and with the ethnic traditions of American Indian, Hispanic, Asian American, and Jewish American autobiography (the last meriting a separate essay). The volume concludes with an essay by Eric Mottram on Norman Mailer. While the essays do not generally break any new ground, they are sound and authoritative and uniformly accessible. This would make an excellent volume for anyone beginning to think about this subject or teaching a course on it. MDO Longenbach, James. STONE COTTAGE: POUND, YEATS &amp; MODERNISM.

Postmodernist studies tend to fall under either the literary or philosophical aegis. Madison's study is, as the title would suggest, primarily philosophical. Thorough chapters are devoted to the prime movers such as Hirsch, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Ricoeur, Gadamer. In may be that it is in the area of philosophy that we best experience the interference of Postmodernism and Continental trends in literary theory (that is, Deconstruction). Indeed, the most interesting chapters in this study are, from a literary viewpoint, those devoted to "A Gadamerian 216</page><page sequence="31">Response to Deconstruction," "Metaphysics as Myth," and "The Philosophic Centrality of the Imagination: A Postmodern Approach." ES Marcus, Jane. ART AND ANGER: READING LIKE A WOMAN. Ohio State University Press, 1988. 286 pp. $30 cloth, $11.95 paper. Marcus has collected some of her more memorable essays in a book whose "sustained argument," she believes, is "the wish to change the subject of literary study." Marcus has undeniably done more than any other scholar/critic to change the terms with which we study Virginia Woolf. The essays on Woolf in this volume serve to remind us of others not reprinted here, and of the volumes of feminist criticism of Woolf edited (and one suspects largely inspired) by Marcus, whose vision of Virginia Woolf as a socialist, pacifist feminist who loved, supported and was supported by women has virtually silenced the "Tintinnabulations" (another essay preserved in this volume) of Quentin Bell, who proffers his own version of Woolf "as frigid snob, invalid lady or mad witch," while, as her literary executor, he "owns and controls" not only "the literary labor of his aunt" but also "the labor of literary critics, who must ask him for permission to quote from Woolf's works." Marcus's insistence on literary labor as labor marks her other major contribution to changing the subject of literary study. From her early essays on Wilde, Meredith, and Ibsen to her recentforay intotheory, "Still Practice, A/Wrested Alphabet," Marcus has "insist(ed] on seeing literary labor in its social context" and defining as feministan aesthetic "materially grounded in process." With Lillian Robinson, she is our foremost exemplar of socialist feminist criticism. ECR Morris, Meaghan. THE PIRATE'S FIANCEE: FEMINISM, READING, POSTMODERNISM. Questions for Feminism. London and New York: Verso Books, 1988. 287 pp. + illus. $50.00 cloth, $16.95 paper. A must-read for all interested in Postmodernism, and especially for those of us who profess the canard that feminist theory or practice has had nothing to do with, and nothing to say to Postmodernism. The "piracy" of the title alludes to strategies of citation and appropriation, of framing familiar to the Postmodern; the fiancee is the woman (and other post- colonial subjects) whose contribution to contemporary thinking has been continually and repeatedly excluded from that "highly invested field of intellectual and political endeavor." This highly eclectic but persistently focused collection begins with an invocation to transform discursive materials in order to make a space from which women can speak, especially to claim thatfeministissues have contributed already, and must continue to contribute to Postmodernism. Morris then clears out cultural feminism with a brilliantcritique of Mary Daly, including her demonology, the projection of the Other, her rejection of multiplicity: "it is a politics of 217</page><page sequence="32">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS subverting isolated signs, not one of transforming discourse." She eliminates a certain version of French theory: "[ilt is the absolute irrelevance of women to feminine writing that is the give-away." She considers with some pleasure the toolbox feminism of Mich&amp;le Le Doeff, which calls for a strategic and mobile transformation from within the misogynous traditions of philosophy. By these essays Morris grounds herself and the book. There follow writings on film (on Crocodile Dundee) and on one's "Gut Reaction"-the latter a fine essay on the practice of writing criticism as distinct from reviewing. Another statement-a book review of Deconstruction-turns on a politically principled defense of the genre of the essay as a necessary link between a wide intelligent reading public and the critical profession (of theory). There are two lyric'essays on photography, and a stinging attack on the Australian Left for its ignorance of Postmodern culture. The latter is then illustrated by meaty essays on Baudrillard, which charges him with the apolitical in the guise of the transpolitical, and on Lyotard and the Postmodern sublime. A feisty and intelligent book. RBD Myers, Thomas. WALKING POINT: AMERICAN NARRATIVES OF VIET NAM. Oxford University Press, 1988. 250 pp. $24.95. Olney, James, ed. STUDIES IN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. Oxford University Press, 1988. 228 pp. $24.95. Olney, whose Metaphors of the Self: The Meaning of Auto-biography is still one of the best studies on the subject, has gathered here a fine collection of essays, written for the First International Symposium on Autobiography and Autobiography Studies, held at Louisiana State University in 1985. As he states in his brief introduction, what distinguishes this voloume from others is "its commemoration of a particular occasion... an epochal event." The seventeen essays (selected from over one hundred submissions) are grouped into four sections: "The Interpretation of Autobiography"; "Ethnic and Minority Autobiography"; "Autobiography as Cultural Expression"; and "Women's Autobiography"; invited papers by James M. Cox, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Georges Gusdorf, and Germaine Bree head each section. A general essay by Wallace Fowlie, "On Writing Autobiography," attempts to round out the collection, although it is unfortunately placed between parts three and four rather than at the beginning or at the end. Particularly enlightening is the essay by Paul John Eakin, "Narrative and Chronology as Structures of Reference and the New Model Autobiographer," which argues that "announcements of the death of the unified subject are premature" and that "narrative is the supremely temporal form." In this sense, Eakin's piece ties in with Germaine Bre6's 218</page><page sequence="33">"Autogynography," which suggests that "new forms of autobiography, women's predominately amongthem, may be pointing to new, viable, less theoretical forms of autobiographical narrative". Three other essays that stand out are William L. Andrew's "Dialogue in Antebellum Afro-American Autobiograpy," Suzanne L. Bunkers's "Midwestern Diaries and Journals: What Women Were (Not) Saying in the Late 1880's," and Charles J. Rzepka's "The Body, the Book, and 'The True Hero of the Tale': DeQuincey's 1821 Confessions and Romantic Autobiography as Cultural Artifact." Gabriella Ibieta, Drexel University Pollock, Griselda. VISION AND DIFFERENCE: FEMININITY, FEMINISM AND THE HISTORIES OF ART. Routledge, 1988. 239 pp. $57.50 cloth, $14.95 paper. A brilliant Marxist-feminist reading of the visual arts, this work intersects with the interests of JML readers in two of its seven essays. One, written with Deborah Cherry, traces "Woman as Sign in Pre-Raphaelite Literature: the Representation of Elizabeth Siddall," and argues that Siddall's position as muse was used by critics who effectively displaced and eradicated her works and her practice as an artist (more than one hundred works) and poet in the minds of critics and consumers of pre-Raphaelite culture. The general lesson about hegemonic critical practices-in the effacement of female artists and writers-has general applicability to the reading of Modernism. Another essay, "Modernity and the Spaces of Femininity," is a critique of the exclusively male genealogy of modern art, arguing that Modernism has been seen as a particularist and gendered set of practices, with masculinevalence. Among its features are the depiction of a sexuality which "enjoys the freedom to look, appraise, and possess." Pollack analyzes the difference of perspective in certain women artists (Morisot, Cassatt) as deriving from their asymmetrical relation "to social and economic power and to meaning." A striking analysis of painting space follows, treating the gaze as mode in which power relations can be registered and transposed. RBD Rader, Barbara A. and Howard G. Zettler, eds. THE SLEUTH AND THE SCHOLAR: ORIGINS, EVOLUTION, AND CURRENT TRENDS IN DETECTIVE FICTION. Greenwood Press, 1988. 160 pp. $29.95. This collecton of formal presentations bears the same title as the October 1986 symposium at which they were presented. Although the speakers deal mainly with a few specific authors (and their sleuths), they point the way to the broadening consciousness of detective ficton. In her keynote address Carolyn Heilbron suggests that mystery authors use the genre as a means to . . . to dabble in a little profound revolutionary thought." The nine essays which follow reinforce this idea, dealing with the mystery novel as a vehicle for social criticism as well as the women writers' feminist quest, reflecting the "mean streets" of the hard-boiled school of 219</page><page sequence="34">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS detective ficton. These critics show how the formula detective story, compressed and tightly structured, can present meaningful social commentary in mid-nineteenth century reporting of slums and crime in addition to highlighting today's public issues and technology. This book should be part of every mystery critic's library, for it illuminates how even this taut, compressed genre can comment effectively on important social issues. Richard P. Moses Raven, Arlene.

Arlene Raven is a feminist activist artist and critic, founder of Chrysalis magazine, and a spokesperson for women in the arts. This book collects her engaged reviews, essays, and commentary, interventions atthe crux of the women's art movement. She offers eloquent remarks about the works which sought social and political transformation by the frank representation of the female condition, including rape, violence against women, and indeed by any representation or performance in which women artists are empowered to depict themselves.

Continuum, 1988. 172 pp. $17.95. Reilly, Patrick. THE LITERATURE OF GUILT: FROM CULLIVERTO GOLDING. University of Iowa Press, 1988. 178 pp. $18. Most readers will respond to the title with an odd kind of energy, fascinated by the possibilities of gathering and analyzing literary works along an axis of guilt. Nobody has done this before, and the construct is obvious, once it has been suggested. Robinson Crusoe is riddled by guilt, and so is Clarissa; Dickens's characters are often consumed by guilt, as are Hawthorne's, the great Russians', and characters in the late Victorians-Hardy, Bennett, Gosse. In the twentieth century there is Joyce, to be sure, Kafka, and Gide. What springs to mind is the possibility of a huge book, an encyclopedia of the literature of guilt. It is, however, something far more sketchy that Reilly has in mind, as he taps into the subject with Swift, and moves on to Conrad, Mann, Orwell, Camus, and Golding. Rather than a survey of guilt, the book offers certain exemplary expressions of a dark, negative epiphany for which the self-recognition of Judas is the prototype. Gulliver's voyage to the land of the Houyhnhnms makes an attractive 220</page><page sequence="35">starting point, but the Travels, Heart of Darkness, and Death in Venice have been read so often in so many contexts that Reilly's reading of them, although he is stylish and ingenious, seem insufficiently original. The best of the readings is the chapter on Camus's The Fall, partly because it is a less obvious choice for an example, partly because The Fall is set against other works, Freud's for instance, that seem to carry us toward similar conclusions but do not. This is, finally, a thoughtful and engaging book, but too slight for the subject which it ingeniously announces. PTS Ross, Andrew, ed. UNIVERSAL ABANDON? THE POLITICS OF POSTMODERNISM.

LITERATURE AND THE BODY: ESSAYS ON POPULATIONS AND PERSONS. Selected Papers from the English Institute, 1986. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988. 220 pp. $22.50. The seven essays that constitute this collection (Mieke Bal's "The Rape of Narrative and the Narrative of Rape: Speech Acts and Body Language in Judges," Christopher Ricks's "Donne After Love," Elaine Scarry's "Donne: 'But yet the body is his booke,"' Frances Ferguson's "Malthus, Godwin, Wordsworth, and the Spirit of Solitude," Jerome Christensen's "Setting Byron Straight: Class, Sexuality, and the Poet," Caroll Smith-Rosenberg's "Domesticating 'Virtue': Coquettes and Revolutionaries in Young America," and Walter Benn Michaels' "The Souls of White Folk") are intended, in the words of Scarry's Introduction, "to restore the material world to literature," an attempt "inspired by a kind of collective regret at the very idea of weightlessness, the inconsequentiality of conversation about literature." The "weightlessness" in question seems to be connected, in Scarry's mind, to attacks upon referentiality in literature, an issue that strikes me as having been of marginal concern even when, in 1986, these papers were delivered. What one eagerly looks forward to is some indication that the poststructuralist stranglehold on the biological is loosening, that the role of the natural (that is to say, the genetic) in the constitution of the human subject has at last become an object of interest and research. One looks in vain for such indications here. The epistemological "models" that emerge from these essays are loosely (and predictably) linguistic ones, and their utility is, accordingly, nil. (To "model" the biological upon the epiphenomemally linguistic is like deducing the morphology of oak trees from the appearance of the acorn.) "The body," writes Scarry in explicating Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, "will always exist in relation to some text: that is a given. The only question is, 221</page><page sequence="36">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS 'Which next?'" It occurs to no one to look to the genome for that text-fortunately, one might add, since what they may find, as the evolutionary biologists are suggesting, could easily outrage the pieties that are deployed here. For, as usual, this is not literary criticism; it is "interventionist reflex," in Scarry's pretentious terms: political tub- thumping for the marginalized of the world. Lit Aid-that is what most "advanced" literary criticism applies to these days, although without the music (save the tiresomely jangling chiasmus: "The Rape of Narration and the Narration of Rape," "The Riddle as Vow and the Vow as Riddle" ...) and without much profit for anyone except the celebrities themselves.

Soja's book is not so much a discussion of an aspect of Postmodern theory as a study of the history of the relationships among cities, space, the economy, architecture, social classes, and the like, and some of the theories which have addressed these relationships. Several chapter titles will give an idea of the thrust of Soja's book: "Marxist Geography and Critical Social Theory," "The Socio-Spatial Dialectic," and "Towards a Spatialized Ontology." Two long closing chapters dissect Los Angeles as a spatial specimen. That city, like Las Vegas, seems to hold special fascination for Postmodernist theoreticians, perhaps in part because of Frederic Jameson's seminal 1984 essay on such megastructures as the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. ES Spivey, Ted R. BEYOND MODERNISM: TOWARD A NEW MYTH CRITICISM. University Press of America, 1988. 226 pp. $12.75 paper. Endeavoring to build on the mythopoesis of Jung, Campbell, and Eliade, Spivey posits a view of Modernism in which "hero" and anti-hero" are familiar terms, "shaman" and "mandala" central concepts, and "deconstruction" a description of what has been happening in the world at large and not just a critical perspective. His perception of Modernism is essentially positive, as an age "when major shamanistic figures like Yeats, Joyce, Eliot, Woolf, Hemingway . . . seek the shamanistic way and achieve a kind of partial healing." (He also considers Conrad, Lawrence, Waugh, Stevens, and Thomas. Among older contemporaries, he finds in Bellow and Percy "sustenance in that aspect of the modernist tradition 222</page><page sequence="37">that points toward the rediscovery of powerful creative forces within the inner self . . . . What Spivey seeks is a new "kind of myth criticism that will bridge the gap between [a still functioning] modernism and a new [Postmodern] age now coming into being ...." Critical deconstruction, he concludes, cannot do the job by itself. It is, I suppose, an admirable vision. Applauding myth and the Modernists and more than a bit suspicious of criticism constructed in the name of Deconstruction, I would be pleased to see such a schema bear fruit.

Truly international, this work, produced in East Germany, was written by a retired Lecturer at Humboldt-Universitat in Berlin and an American mystery writer and editor. It is a monumental effort to put crime fiction into a millennial perspective, reaching from crime and death in Greek tragedies to today's prolific professional authors. It succeeds as a rapid overview of the genre, but in that success it fails deeply to cover present- day fiction and the growing shoots of new approaches such as feminist writing, spy novels, and Marxist criticism. The text and illustrations blend well and reinforce each other; the translation from the original German does not interfere with the author's flow of ideas. The book's strength lies in three areas: a source of information on Continental mystery writers less well-known in America, the easy applicability of the genre to cinema and television, and a concise history of crime fiction going back to classical Greece and Rome. It should be very useful to anyone working in these areas. Richard P. Moses 223</page><page sequence="38">G-3 THEMES &amp; MOVEMENTS Young, James E.

The great virtue of Young's study of the Holocaust is that it encompasses a wide range of materials within a theoretically sophisticated analytic structure. In part one, in successive chapters, Young considers the various forms by which the experience and memory of the War terror have been represented: diaries and memoirs, legends and tales (Yaffa Eliach and Sara Nomberg-Prytyk), documentary fiction (D.M. Thomas), documentary drama (Peter Weiss); in part two, Young moves from genres to the general problem of the Holocaust as "metaphor", including discussion of the word "holocaust" and its usage, and the ways writers (Jewish and non-Jewish) have appropriated the Holocaustas metaphor for collective and individual trauma (John Berryman, Sylvia Plath). In a third part, Young analyzes the larger categories of remembrance by which societies have publicly memorialized the events of the War: video testimonies, films, sculptures and memorials. Throughout, Young brings to bear a scrupulous literary and moral conscience, raising a host of vexing and fascinating issues relating to the special nature of this material. MDO Zukofsky, Louis.

MODERNISM &amp; THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE. University of Chicago Press, 1987. 122 pp. $19.95. Like Filippo Brunellischi performing tricks with mirrors to offer new views of the Baptistry and the first example of perspective painting, Houston Baker offers new perspectives on the literary period known as the Harlem Renaissance. In the process, he produces his own work of art. This critical triumph is what Baker calls a "speaking manual." Beginning with his consideration of the "Harlem Renaissance as Failure," Baker shifts the grounds of all argument and suggests that we have asked the wrong 225</page><page sequence="40">G-4 REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND ETHNIC question. "To ask why the renaissance failed," he argues, "is to agree, at the very outset, that the twenties did not have profoundly beneficial effects for areas of African-American discourse that we have only recen- tly begun to explore in depth." Baker sees the Harlem Renaissance as a successful act of national self-definition, and he positions Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois as its important precursors. These men "understood the importance of a modern Afro-American sound." Baker sees them as initiating the art of sounding and builds on their legacy by offering the new terms, "mastery of form" and "deformation of mastery" for his expression of African-American expressive art. These terms describe what Baker calls strategies integral to "black intellectual history." Washington's Up from Slavery is an example of mastery of form, offering reassuring sounds for a particular audience (white). It is Washington's "speaking manual," a sign and a wonder; an example of complete mastery of form. Using Susan Stewart's definition of nonsense, Baker demonstrates how Washington moves beyond expectations of his audience tocontrolling their perceptions. Washington stepped inside the white world's nonsense syllables with oratorical mastery. Deformation of master is a strategy used by W.E.B. Du Bois and others who are "modern" in their attempt to thwart white expectations, reverting to the sounds of the "African ancestral past." Baker's work itself is what he calls deformation of mastery as he recon- ceptualizes the Harlem Renaissance by repositioning the players, forcing us to reconsider it all in new ways and using new terms.

This collection of sixteen essays is the third in a series-Modern (1972), Contemporary, (1983) and now New Irish Writing--dedicated to the memory of Ray Porter, co-editor of the first two volumes. With a few exceptions, "new" here refers to writing since about the mid-1970s. While the editors have notimposed any preconceived perspective on the contributors, various related concerns do recur in these essays and thus suggest that a shared consciousness exists in recent Irish writing. In his introduction, Eamon Grennan suggests "family, multiplicity, and faith" 226</page><page sequence="41">as three broad headings underwhich mostof these essays can find a home. Christopher Murray's essay on Irish drama sees it as a recurring concern with linking the local with the universal, "the priority always with the local." In poetry, Anthony Bradley sees "a highly civilized and intelligent dialectic between the contested cultural values of modern Ireland." From various perspectives, the essays return to questions of the Irish writers' relationships to cultural traditions and what Grennan calls "the site of creative tension between social forces and imagination." Individual essays focus on such concepts as the journey motif, the presence of the "otherworld," and the elegiac tradition as areas in which contemporary writers have connected to ancient themes. Other essays focus on a range of contemporary authors, reminding us of the diversity of exciting voices in all genres of contemporary Irish literature. The range and quality of the contemporary Irish literature. The range and quality of the essays in this collection are testimony to the excitement and richness in Irish writing today.

James Cahalan, author of Great Hatred, Little Room: The Irish Historical Novel(1983), broadens his focus here to incorporate the Irish novel from its pre-Edgeworth beginnings to the present. The study ranges over an impressive array of novelists, both in English and in Irish. Among the twentieth-century novelists discussed here are Samuel Beckett, Jennifer Johnston, James Joyce, Benedict Kiely, John McGahern, Brian Moore, George Moore, Flann O'Brien, Edna O'Brien, Miirtfn O Cadhain, Pidraic O Conaire, Peadar O'Donnell, Eimar O'Duffy, Sean O'Faolain, Liam O'Flaherty, Forrest Reid, James Stephens, Francis Stuart, and Mervyn Wall. The emphasis is on general description and evaluation, on forces atwork in the novels, and on the directions taken by critics concerned with these writers. This survey is as comprehensive as it can be in a single volume, and the material is both useful and, generally, reliable. Still there are occasional lapses. Concerning Joyce, Cahalan repeats as factual one story that is highly conjectural (that the phrase "What is it" on p. 223 of Finnegans Wake entered the text by mistake when Beckett wrote down Joyce's response to a noise) and another that is untrue (that Joyce wrote the Exagmination letter signed by Vladimir Dixon); see Thomas A. 227</page><page sequence="42">G-4 REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND ETHNIC Goldwasser's refutation of this story in the James Joyce Quarterly (Spring 1979). Cahalan's lengthy (but highly selective) discussion of Joyce criticism is intended to illustrate approaches that might also be applied to other writers, a strategy that almost compensates for his eccentric description of American Joyce scholarship as a variety of "cultural imperialism" and his irrelevant contention that"Each one of the hundreds of dissertations, books, and articles on Joyce is one thatdoes notexamine the valuable work of P,draic 6 Conaire, Kate O'Brien, Charles Lever, or dozens of other Irish novelists." That critics, deprived of Joyce, mightmore readily turn to Faulkner or Woolf than to Charles Lever does not seem to have occurred to him. Even so, Cahalan's desire to stimulate more specialized studies of neglected Irish novelists is laudable. If he is as successful in generating those studies as he has been in providing a succinct overview of the Irish novel, Cahalan will have achieved two important goals. Patrick A. McCarthy, University of Miami Callahan, John F. IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN GRAIN: THE PURSUIT OF VOICE IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY BLACK FICTION. University of Illinois Press, 1988. 280 pp. $21.95. In eight chapters-of which five discuss individual twentieth-century African-American writers-Callahan offers a thesis linking the political and aesthetic implications of oral story-telling in its bearing on modern African-American fiction. Focusing especially on the motif of call and response, which involves a political and rhetorical relationship between griots/speakers and their audience, Callahan discusses central works of Charles Chestnutt, Jean Toomer, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, Ernest Gaines, and Alice Walker. In a fascinating move of homage and expression at once, Callahan opens his book with an essay-memoir of his ethnic roots as an Irish-American in intersection with African- Americans-on the job, in historical action, and in his political meditations. By telling us "who he's for" in a committed and engaged fashion, he can ground his book in its personal and cultural necessity, and he can show us how he understands the parallel and similar necessities of black writers. Call and response-the key rhetorical form-makes listeners into witnesses and participants. It is a flexible form, used for various purposes and functions by the different authors, but all the authors' works are unified by the ethical and political desire for freedom and social justice, so that novels and stories serve a morally evocative function in bringing readers and listeners back to the ideals of American society. Callahan offers sympathetic, enthusiastic, and unimpeachable readings of call and response in the context of individual novels. RBD 228</page><page sequence="43">Candelaria, Cordelia. CHICANO POETRY: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION. Greenwood Press, 1988. xvi + 260 pp. $35. The author's three-fold purpose in writing this book, 'to present an overview of Chicano poetry from 1967 to the present..., to apply salient critical theories and methodologies . . ., and to apply a bilingual, multicultural perspective" to the chosen texts, is only partly successful. Candelaria's effort fills a gap in the existing body of work on Chicano poetry and places both the poets and their texts within a cultural, literary, and political context. Particularly useful is the bibliography, which cites both primary and secondary sources. The book is marred, however, by a confused and confusing theoretical framework and by arbitrary and gratuitously polemical terminology that, in fact, adds nothing to its argument ("Yankee refers to U.S. American people, things and life as distinct from other Americans"). The Prologue and the first chapter try to give an historical and literary context to Chicano culture and poetry, but suffer from poor organization and unclear writing. In the following chapters-the most valuable and interesting-the author distinguishes three phases within contemporary Chicano poetry. The first phase is characterized almost exclusively by "protest" poems, such as Rodolfo Gonzales's I am oaqufn(1967), and the "pinto" (convict) poetry of Ricardo Sinchez, dealing with the poet's personal experiences. The second phase is marked by a striving towards a "Chicano poetics" and is best represented by the work of Alurista, which integrates bilingualism, indigenous themes, and miscegenation. The third phase is defined as the "flowering" of Chicano poetry and is characterized by the poets' "lyrical subtlety" and "multiplicity of themes." Gary Soto's The Elements of San Joaqufn (1977) and several poems by Bernice Zamora and In6s Tovar are also typical of this phase. Chapter 5 "seeks to show how Chicano poetry lies ... within the full mainstream of world literature," an attemptwhich in a sense destroys the book's implicit political stance. The Epilogue introduces an unfortunate conceit, a play on words of a refrain from a popular Mexican song ("Ay, ay, ay, ay, canta y no Ilores . .."); the author's conclusions are made to fit the homophonic and bilingual "eye/l/ay/hay," a confusing device that mechanizes and reduces the poetry that she cares so much about.

THE SOUTHERN AGRARIANS. University of Tennessee Press, 1988. 196 pp. illus. $24.95 cloth, $12.95 paper. This very readable book is the work of a Vanderbilt historian, who has already written a "biography" of the University. Paul Conkin examines the labyrinthine ways of a group of men who gathered atVanderbilt"for some 229</page><page sequence="44">G-4 REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND ETHNIC heavy philosophical discussions" as early as 1915 and then went on to publish four volumes of a magazine called The Fugitive. Four of the original Fugitives, John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Donald Davidson, and Robert Penn Warren, joined with others to launch the Agrarian movement, which survived into the late 1930s. (Conkin is careful to distinguish between the Fugitives and the later Agrarians.) More than two decades of Vanderbilt and Nashville history are on display here as Conkin assumes the roles of historian, biographer, social and political commentator, and occasionally even literary critic. At the nerve center of his study are Ransom, Tate, and Davidson, whom he refers to, somewhat inelegantly, as "the big three." In Conkin's scenario Ransom is in certain ways the villain of the piece, Davidson its hero. At one point there is a reference to 'Ransom's treason. He not only used a 1945 article to repudiate his earlier Agrarianism, but he sent a copy to Davidson. This seemed salt on a wound." Davidson is described in polymath terms as "sweet and genial towards friends, a devoted and superb teacher of creative writing, a periodically active lyrical poet, an increasingly well-informed folklorist, a sometimes balanced and acutely perceptive essayist, a talented historian, a perceptive observer of the new country music industry in Nashville . . .." (This position seems at odds with the accustomed notion of Ransom as mentor and nurturer and Davidson as pariah.) The central text for the Agrarians is the 1930 I'll TakeMyStand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition. Conkin is very effective in discussing the twelve essays and the introductory manifesto which comprise the collection. In his Epilogue Conkin interestingly likens I'll Take My Stand to Reinhold Niebuhr's Moral Man and Immoral Society and to John Dewey's Liberalism and Social Action. Itis much to Conkin's credit that he takes the Agrarians seriously even though he is quick to point out the eccentricities of the individual "brethren." He denies them, as he points out, "the collective unity they wanted or claimed," but revels in their spirited stand against collectivism and their "support for the proprietary ideal." MJF Cunningham, Valentine. BRITISH WRITERS OF THE THIRTIES. Oxford, 1988. 530 pp. $64. Cunningham's enormous survey takes in not only the big names of the Auden Generation but innumerable lesser writers who were active during the 1930s. The author is interested in practically everything that went on in the period, and the reader learns much, not only about literature, but about the social, political, and cultural contexts in which itwas produced and which it reflected. Everything is here: unemployment, rising fascism, the cult of schooldays, Surrealism, Mass Observation, and, of course, the Spanish Civil War. Cunningham has succumbed, without much resistance it seems, to the myth of the Thirties that the writers themselves generated 230</page><page sequence="45">at the time and which has been growing steadily ever since. He is extraordinarily knowledgeable, and hewrites with energy and enthusiasm. The book is both informative and very readable, but it is liable to become wearying if read for long stretches, as Cunningham's style is rapid and breathless, and he is a resolutely associative and digressive writer, continually darting or swerving from one text or writer or topic or anecdote to another. Much of the book has the lively buttransient interest of gossip rather than of conventional literary history. It is, without doubt, an essential work on the 1930s in Britain and, in a sense, is never likely to be surpassed. But Cunningham is interested in so many different issues that he blurs the basic outlines of the period. BBer Debusscher, Gilbert. AMERICAN LITERATURE IN BELGIUM. Humanities Press, International, Inc., 1988. 266 pp. $60 paper. Dembo, L.S. THE MONOLOGICAL JEW: A LITERARY STUDY. University of Wisconsin Press, 1988. 196 pp. $32.50 cloth, $13.50 paper. For Dembo, the term "monological Jew" suggests a paradigm, one whose variations appear throughout a large group of texts such as Abraham Cahan's The Rise of David Levinsky, Henry Roth's Call It Sleep, Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus, I.B. Singer's The Family Moskat, as well as in the poetry of Charles Reznikoff and George Oppen. Derived in large part from the philosophy of Martin Buber and to a lesser extent from the work of M.M. Bakhtin, Dembo defines the term this way: a Monological Jew is "a useful abstraction even though it covers a multiplicity of characteristics, not all of which are coordinate with each other. To begin with, it refers to a Jew of the Diaspora who has abandoned monotheism but who, having thus removed the mind and soul of Judaism, still feels himself to be a Jew-and yet not a Jew." With this benchmark in mind, Dembo assembles sixteen short, loosely connected essays. Unfortunately, the results are as uneven as they are disappointing. In most cases (the essays on language and poetry being the notable exceptions), Dembo drags Buber kicking and screaming into literary discussions where his ideas neither properly belong nor usefully fit. For example, in discussing Call It Sleep, David Schearl's confusions-about everything from the assorted immigrantterrors thatcomprise his quotidian world to the mystical experiences he feels but cannot articulate-Dembo rushes in with the "answer" to David's problem: "He needs what Buber might call a partner-in-dialogue; what he finds is isolation and the constant fear his lack of knowledge brings to him." Even among those whose hearts beat faster whenever Bakhtin's name is solemnly invoked, The Monological Jew is likely to seem like so much thin borscht. As for those simply looking for insightful readings of selected Jewish-American classics, Dembo does raise several interesting questions, but for all the flashes of independence, the collection, as a whole, adds up to decidedly less than the sum of its parts.

THE USES OF THE PAST: ESSAYS ON IRISH CULTURE. Associated University Presses (for University of Delaware Press), 1988. 196 pp. $28.50. This volume represents the most recent work of many of the artists and scholars who participated in the 1985 national meeting of the American Committee for Irish Studies. The presence of the past in Irish culture provides the focus of their studies, and contributors examine this presence from perspectives as diverse as faction-fighting (James S. Donnelly, Jr.), women writers (Bonnie Kime Scott), or the uneasy alliance between the Gaelic League and thewriters ofthe Literary Renaissance(Philip O'Leary). Novelist Thomas Flanagan writes of contrasting fables in The Year of the French, and Irish poet Richard Murphy examines "The Uses of History in Poetry." One essay, in particular, provides an insightful analysis of the Irish obsession with history. In "The War against the Past," Declan Kiberd demonstrates how the obliteration of a culture by colonialism leads to a paralyzing sanctification of revivalism. While the past displaces the 232</page><page sequence="47">present, the Irish-victims of their own literary history-live their lives as a cycle of pathological repetitions. Kiberd then traces this aspect of Irish life in the works of Joyce, Pearse, Synge, Yeats, O'Casey, Friel, and Heaney. Against the background of a Literary Revival, the Irish actually lost a language and the remains of an identity. As a consequence of that loss, Cr6 na Cille, one of the most important novels ever written in Ireland, had to be translated into English before it could receive even slight critical attention. RobertTracy's fine study of 6 Cadhain's novel aptly illustrates the final betrayal by the praisers of their own pasts: MSirtin O Cadhain merely had to look at his own life to witness the death of the culture which so obsessed the revivalists. Here, where Joyce left off, is the final metaphor of Irish identity: the dead, in a Connemara graveyard, speak to each other in a dying language. As 0 Cadhain understood when he made the television documentary, MSirtfn 6 Cadhain ar an gCnocln Glas, the final act of colonialism was inflicted by a newly independent people on the community in which he himself had grown up. PAM Gates, Jr., Henry Louis. THE SIGNIFYING MONKEY: A THEORY OF AFRO- AMERICAN LITERARY CRITICISM. Oxford University Press, 1988. 290 pp. $29.95. Already having achieved a classic status in contemporary and African- American literary studies, The Signifying Monkey is an elegant and provocative work of theory, asking how the "'black tradition' had theorized about itself." Gates's answer is a wide-ranging exploration of Afro-American writing and folk vernacular literature, and African art; he takes up, in brilliant and exemplary readings, Zora Neale Hurston, Ishmael Reed, Alice Walker, slave narratives (from 1760 to 1865), and he mentions in course Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison, Jean Toomer, Charles Chestnutt, and Sterling Brown (among others). In his readings there is a careful and articulate thesis about the ways black writers imitated, transposed, revised, and "signified upon" each other, and on the cultural traditions of Afro- Americans, as well as a construct of a relationship with white literary precursors (not the subject here). The first.half of the book is devoted to theorizing Afro-American literary criticism. The daring of the book is seen here, in its postulate of a "theory of criticism that is inscribed within the black vernacular tradition"; it follows that the site of coherent and articulate theory may be found in venues surprising to the academic traditionalist, such as street talk, playing the dozens, and toasts, jiving of all sorts. Gates projects a "myth of origins" for the rhetoric of"signifyin(g)" in two African and (later) Caribbean trickster figures: the Signifying Monkey (for oral discourse) and the Yoruba Esu-Elegbara (for written discourse), a "Hermes" figure. Both Monkey and God are masters of hermeneutics; in relationship they represent a tension between oral and written modes which, Gates argues, is repeatedly confronted and solved differently in black writing. Thus to better-known black tropes of "the 233</page><page sequence="48">G-4 REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND ETHNIC descent underground, the 'ascent' from South to North, [and] myriad figures of the double," Gates adds "The Talking Book." For that Book, he proposes that the representation of vernacular black voices in writing (as in Hurston), the omnivorous intertextualities(as in Reed the parodist), and the celebratory use of ancestral texts (as in Walker, with pastiche) are all versions of signifyin(g) upon: homage to, critique of, revisionary strategies within, Afro-American textual practices. What then is "Signifyin(g)"? It is a marked use of language different from (white) norms, involving black dialect, slang, formal revision, trope-making, pastiche, "loud talking, testifying, sounding, rapping, playingthe dozens," rhetorical moves rather less informational, rather more a conveying of attitude and ironical social stance (even an attitude). Gates's two chapters of definition ("The Signifying Monkey and the Language of Signifyin(g)" and the "Figures of Signification") are (unredundantly) highly significant statements of the rhetorics and poetics of black culture. They are, and this book is, essential reading. RBD Gates, Jr., Henry Louis, ed. 'RACE,' WRITING, and DIFFERENCE. University of Chicago Press, 1987. 422 pp. $30. As the title suggests, this collection is concerned primarily with deconstructing the idea of difference as "inscribed in the trope of race." Twenty-one essays and a series of lively responses by Harold Fromm, Mary Louise Pratt, Henry Louis Gates, and Houston Baker are the culmination of what began as two issues of Critical Inquiry (Autumn 1985) for which Gates served as guest editor. Employing critical approaches ranging from Marxism to Post-Structuralism, the essayists attempt to answer the question posed by Gates: "What importance does 'race' have as a meaningful category in the study of literature and the shaping of critical theory?" Naturally, most of the essays demonstrate the authors' acceptance of the project: demonstrating how writing relates to race, how attitudes toward racial differences generate and structure literary texts. Most essayists conclude that "race" does have ultimate significance in the study of literature and the development of critical theory. Tzvetan Todorov is positioned as the "embedded" critic voicing wisdom as he warns against the danger inherent in racial stereotyping, a consequence of the oppositional nature of many of the essays. Todorov laments the "facility with which we choose the right side" of controversial issues. Todorov's presence as dissenting voice may seduce the resisting reader as effectively as the diverse cast of Africans, African-Americans, and Asians pleases the already converted. From Anthony Appiah's reassessment of DuBois's ideas on race to Edward Said's exploration of difference as it adheres in the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, to Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's examination of the exclusionary strategies of Western literature 234</page><page sequence="49">and criticism, these essays speak for and from the position of the "Other." F. Elaine DeLancey, Drexel University Hadda, Janet. PASSIONATE WOMEN, PASSIVE MEN: SUICIDE IN YIDDISH LITERATURE. SUNY Press, 1988. 223 pp. $44.50 cloth, $14.95 paper. Hadda's study is both a thematic consideration of fictional suicides and a ground breaking effort in the application of post-Freudian ideas to traditional Yiddish texts. As such, it seeks to explain, and to understand, a phenomenon that Jewish law explicitly forbids and that traditional Jews did not discuss. Nonetheless, suicides did occur, and with alarming frequency as Modernism in a variety of faces shook the very foundations of East European Jewry and took its toll on individual Jews. By way of evidence, Hadda points out that the Warsaw newspaper, Undzer lebn, "contains over fifty articles and references to suicide within the first six months of its publication, that is, between March and August of 1907." However, as Hadda hastens to point out, hers is not an attempt to study the actual role of suicide in Jewish life. Rather, her book focuses on what had been a hitherto little noticed phenomenon-namely, the "unexpectedly frequent occurrence in modern Yiddish literature of characters who commit suicide." Her aim is to concentrate on "the behavior, thoughts, fantasies, and dreams of literary characters from the perspective of psychoanalytic clinical principles in order to illuminate the factors leading up to their suicides." In this case, the results are more impressive-both in terms of methodology and individual critical analyses-than her statement of goals might suggest. What Hadda has discovered is the pattern reflected in her study's title: The men who ultimately commit suicide are chronically withdrawn or inert, a condition that renders them incapable of sustaining the demands of marriage or, in less traditional circumstances, of competing to win a desired woman. The women, for their part, are too willful to be tolerated by conventional standards. Most commonly, their intensity is directed towards pursuing an independent lifestyle, sometimes involving taboo sexual behavior. Hadda draws her evidence from a wide variety of examples: Y.L. Peretz's Four Generations-Four Wills, Sholom Aleichem's Tevye stories, David Bergelson's The Deaf Man, Chaim Grade's The Agunah, I.B. Singer's The Magician of Lublin, as well as other, less well-known Yiddish fiction. That she is conversant with psychoanalytic thought is apparent; that she is deeply read in Yiddish literature is equally obvious; but that she writes about both with such lucidity and purpose turns what might have been merely workmanlike into something truly distinctive.

Havard knows his poets and has published previously on them. His approach, focusing on and moving out from the close textual reading of a single poem, is quite effective; his readings are sensitive, particularly his remarkably unforced Freudian analysis of Federico Garcfa Lorca. But even this essay deals inadequately with the book's presumed thesis: Havard is not explicit enough on Lorca's move toward Surrealism, although he aptly cites individual manifestations. He does not develop a discussion of the progression of his title, either in individual essays or in the very brief Introduction and Conclusion. If it is to have more coherence than a simple group of individual essays, the study needs an overview that is more synthesizing and detailed than Havard's perception of these poets' "earnest endeavour to find meaning .. . [which] results in poetry that is remarkably meaningful." ASL Hohendahl, Peter Uwe. A HISTORY OF GERMAN LITERARY CRITICISM, 1730- 1980.

Latin American societies have always been acutely race-conscious, and Jackson places Black literature squarely in the context of the complex socio-political concerns of the region. This study advocates the formulation of a humanism that-by combining the elements of Negritude, Indigenismo, and Latino-Americanismo-would solve the most vexing problem of Latin American Literature: how to find an authentic national and individual identity. Although he does not delve into the intricacies of the problem as deeply as one would wish, Jackson does a fine job of calling attention to works that have been overshadowed by mainstream Latin American literature. Among the authors he considers are Ecuador's Nelson Estupinan Bass, the Columbians Jorge Artel, Juan Zapata Olivella, and Manuel Zapata Olivella, Panama's Carlos Guillermo Wilson and Costa Rico's Quince Duncan. His basic premise-that Latin American humanism will never develop without a reckoning of Black voices-is certainly correct, and Jackson provides a good framework for the study of this rich tradition of literature. Richard J. Prouty 236</page><page sequence="51">Johnson, Charles. BEING &amp; RACE: BLACK WRITING SINCE 1970. Indiana University Press, 1988. 132 pp. $15.95. Johnson offers an analysis of the major black writers, women and men, who have been publishing since 1970. In his restrained yet pointed criticism of contemporaryfiction produced by African-Americans, Johnson laments the factthat"image control has been the aim of black fiction-and perhaps its problem from the very beginning of black literary production." Johnson points to the failure of the Harlem Renaissance as an example of the inherent difficulty of controlling images. Positioning African-American literary practices in apposition to "high art," Johnson frames his observations about these practices with references from the European philosophical and literary tradition. From this ideal universal space he evaluates the African-American literary effort. Throughout the text, Johnson characterizes errors and missteps. A major pitfall for the Black Arts Movement, for example, is its historical position as the"cultural wing" of the Black Power Movement. Cultural Nationalists probably would not characterize such an alliance as a pitfall. And neither, it seems, would many academicians who are tending toward a new examination of the nature of this relationship. Although seemingly reluctant to criticize African-American writers directly, Johnson frequently counterpoises specific writers against his own idea of what "good writing" should be. As the author of several books, Johnson has the benefit of his own experiences to offer the reader. F. Elaine DeLancey, Drexel University Kearney, Richard. TRANSITIONS: NARRATIVES IN MODERN IRISH CULTURE. Manchester University Press and St. Martin's Press, 1988. 318 pp. $39.50. In this eclectic and stimulating collection of essays, Richard Kearney examines the conflict between tradition and modernity in twentieth- century Irish narratives. By "narrative," Kearney means any symbolic expression, and his examples of narratives run the gamut from literary and dramatic works (the poems of Yeats and Heaney, fiction by Joyce, Beckett, and others, plays by Brian Friel and Tom Murphy) to visual narratives (the Irish movies Angel and Maeve, Louis le Brocquy's paintings) and ideological narratives (the nationalist myth of blood sacrifice and the role of the Irish cultural journal). Most of the essays have been published previously in The Crane Bag and other journals, but their appearance here will help to bring them to the larger audience that they deserve. That audience will find several stumbling blocks in the way of its appreciation and assimilation of Kearney's argument. An interview with Jorge Luis Borges, although interesting in its own right, bears no discernible relationship to the preceding discussion of Joyce; commentaries on Derrida and Heidegger, on the other hand, are clearly relevant to Kearney's thesis, but are not developed at sufficient length for most readers. The connection between one essay and another is not 237</page><page sequence="52">G-4 REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND ETHNIC always clear, and the absence of an index makes it difficult to relocate a passage in order to compare it with a later statement. Perhaps more significant is Kearney's habit of quoting without page citations, making it hard to check the context or accuracy of a quote. And there are errors: "At the conclusion [of At-Swim-Two-Birds], Sarah the maid discovers that Furriskey and his friends are but inventions of her master Trellis." In fact, the maid (whose name is Teresa) discovers no such thing. Luckily, the errors are outweighed by the intelligence and originality of Kearney's readings. His discussion of the myth of martyrdom is especially helpful, incorporating as it does readings of the rhetoric and symbolism of Irish nationalism in a discussion ranging from Yeats to the hunger strikers at Long Kesh prison. Few critics of Irish literature and culture have made clearer than Kearney the high price Ireland has paid, and continues to pay, for its failure to make the transition from its romantic nationalistic myths to a modern sense of Irish cultural identity. Patrick A. McCarthy, University of Miami Keene, Donald. THE PLEASURES OF JAPANESE LITERATURE. Columbia University Press, 1988. Companions to Asian Studies. 133 pp. $19. One approaches a book by Keene with respect and a measure of awe. More than a translator (a formidable task with any Asian language), Keene is undoubtedly the foremost interpreter of Japanese culture to the West. This book contains five lectures on Japanese aesthetics and literature which he delivered in 1986 and 1987. Acknowledging that literary modes have changed in Japan in the last fifty years, Keene chooses, nevertheless, to concentrate on the traditional concepts and methods which have shaped the literature for so many centuries. Opening with a disarming admission of the inherent difficulties of generalizations, Keene adopts the fourteenth-century Essays in Idleness as the exemplar of Japanese aesthetics. He traces from this base the traditions which formed the characteristic modes in poetry, fiction, and theater. In the first essay Keene introduces central themes: "suggestion," "irregularity," "simplicity," and" perishability," which he believes epitomize the Japanese arts. Following these motifs through the three areas of the literature, he describes a culture which delights in "open-endedness"-art that deliberately provides space for the play of imagination. He notes the Japanese preferences-for natural asymmetrywhich has not been confined by human order, for the freedom of vacant spaces, and for the acceptance of the evanescence of worldly objects. Japanese art is, therefore, "minimalist"-not through a lack of representation, but through a purposeful incompleteness. Keene illustrates this concept by describing an artist who chooses to paint a mountain in black and white, rather than limit the viewer's imagination by assigning colors. 238</page><page sequence="53">Keene acknowledges the important influence of Chinese aesthetics, yet he argues that the Japanese were not slavish followers, but-as in the case of the novelistAkinari-they "rewrote them [the Chinese originals] so brilliantly that they are usually far more effective as literature . . .." His essay on theatre is particularly interesting, offering both origins and historical contexts for the very different styles of drama-all of which are still performed and are extremely popular. Scholars of Japanese literature may find the book disappointingly superficial, but then, they probably owe much of their understanding to Keene's meatier works. But those uninitiated readers who seek an entree into this ancient culture will find the essays interesting and informative; the bibliography will lead them to works of greater scope and depth. JKG Kenneally, Michael, ed. CULTURAL CONTEXTS AND LITERARY IDIOMS IN CONTEMPORARY IRISH LITERATURE. Studies in Contemporary Irish Literature No. 1, Irish Literary Studies No. 31. Barnes &amp; Noble, 1988. 369 pp. $29.75. The firstof a projected four-volume series evaluating Irish literature since the 1950s, Michael Kenneally's collection of essays provides an intellectual framework within which to consider the remarkable response of writers, especially poets, to an Ireland riven by the impact of sectarian violence in the North and the Republic's growing alliance with the European community. The most pervasive theme is the burden of the past, mythicized and therefore to some extent "deterministic," according to Edna Longley ("When Did You Last See Your Father?") in the work of John Montague, Seamus Heaney, Brian Friel, and Bernard MacLaverty, but treated subversively by Paul Muldoon, who'interrogates history" through techniques which "sabotage all kinds of certainty." In "Literature and Culture in the North of Ireland," Tony Bradley offers an incisive profile of notable writers in terms of their main cultural traditions, termed reluctantly but accurately, "Catholic" and "Protestant." He observes that while the former tend to be more committed to Irish and religious traditions, what contemporary writers have in common is a rejection of "that Calvinistic blend of religion and politics" that dominated "the whole quality of life in Ulster." In "Island of Saints and Silicon," Fintan O'Toole offers a wry, penetrating account of the socio-economic revolution which produced, along with a prosperous urban and cosmopolitan middle class, a general weakening of nationalist ideology; as a consequence, Ireland itself "as a fixed and coherent notion, ceased to exist." He contends that the result is "cultural schizophrenia," which is 'evaded" by writers such as Brian Friel and Thomas Kinsella (whom he oddly underestimates) by placing the "sense of loss and rupture" in an historical and linguistic context (Translations and An Duanaire). Among the other valuable critiques are Colbert Kearney's "The Treasure of Hungry Hill," about the Irish language, and Terence Brown's "Yeats, Joyce, and the Current Irish Critical Debate," which advocates new readings of the two colossi, too often presented in "adversarial poses," the one circling at a "graceful elegiac height" above, the other swimming 239</page><page sequence="54">G-4 REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND ETHNIC manfully through that"filthy modern tide." Kenneally also includes essays which testify to the substantial achievements of women writers, Eavan Boland, Edna O'Brien, Medbh McGuckian, Molly Keane, Eithne Strong, Julia O'Faolain and Jennifer Johnston. In "Shadows of Destruction," for example, on the resurgence of the Big House theme in fiction, Andrew Parkin observes that "Molly Keane's great achievement is that she makes the failing Ascendancy become at once a profound tragi-comic subject and a potent metaphor of all human pretensions." This is an exemplary and important collection, which argues well for the continuing vitality of Irish literature. Maureen Waters, Queens College. Lambropoulos, Vassilis. LITERATURE AS NATIONAL INSTITUTION: STUDIES IN THE POLITICS OF MODERN GREEK CRITICISM. Princeton University Press, 1988. 260 pp. $34. In his informative and articulate Introduction, critic and theoretician Lambropoulos explains how he will destruct (in the Post-structuralist sense) the artificial truth promoted in historical, biographical, or critical studies of Modern Greek Literature and especially the authors Solomos, Makriyannis, Beratis, Apostolidis, Ritsos, and Cavafy, as presented for public acceptance by influential commentators such as Dimaras, Polylas, Seferis, and others. Assuming a thorough mastery of these writers' oeuvres, Lambropoulos exclusively discusses specific studies of critics concerning them-in individual chapters-and decisively reveals the intentional fallacies, questionable theses, or self-serving attitudes in them. Of course, he never forgets the existing historical conditions that prevailed when these critical texts were produced. In the process of achieving his purpose-in which he is impressively successful due to his erudition and "scientific" methodology-he singles outthe intentions or biases of each critic as well as the social and cultural reasons that dictated them, that is, the "politics" which resulted in the formulation of a literary canon since the 1830s, and the general acceptance of Modern Greek Literature as a "national institution" attesting to the historical Greekness of its makers and responsive readership. A telling example of Lambropoulos's professional performance is his brilliant"deconstruction" of Polylas's celebrated Prolegomenato his 1859 edition of the poetry of Dionysios Solomos (1798-1857), Greece's National Bard, which he persuasively classifies as a romantic KOnstlerroman that succeeded in creating and establishing two "supreme fictions": Solomos's stature as a Bard and the holistic "nature" of his fragmentary poetic compositions. He is equally convincing in his analyses of the linguistic and nationalistic reasons Seferis had in pronouncing General Makriyannis's Memoirs a literary masterpiece, or of the uniformly positive acceptance 240</page><page sequence="55">of Ritsos's bulky oeuvre by a plethora of Greek and foreign critics. The same is true of the way Lambropoulos discusses the rest of his subjects. This composite treatise achieves unity as a result of the poststructuralist principles which the author employs in his nine semi- independent chapters (essays, actually; some of them already published in academic journals). Original, trail blazing, and valuable in its purpose to bring system and professionalism to the rather amateurish and unsystematic Modern Greek Criticism, the volume is completed by a postscript on the elements of modern hermeneutics, a substantial international bibliography, and an index of names.

SOUTHERNERS AND EUROPEANS: ESSAYS IN A TIME OF DISORDER. Louisiana State University Press, 1988. xix + 308 pp. $32.50. It is helpful to have in one volume these essays from several journals and books: regardless of how we approach them, they are too good to remain scattered. Lewis P. Simpson, who we may conjecture persuaded Lytle to gather them, provides a justly appreciated foreword. Lytle, one of the editors who made the Sewanee Review both a major organ of the new criticism and a major organ of the Southern Agrarian Conservatism, was and is one of the American sympathizers with those European conservatives-Baudelaire, Maurras, Bernanos, Houston Stewart Chamberlain among them-who regarded the discovery of America as a major disaster, bringing in its train the destruction of all valid aristocracy, all social decorum, and all spiritual values. In similar manner, he regards the defeat of the Confederacy as a defeat for Christendom. He begs all such questions. But-his defenses of the indefensible and his excuses for the inexcusable notwithstanding-he has a fine sensitivity to the art ofwriting, and this makes his purely literary judgments valuable: this volume of literary essays is uncommonly stimulating in its rich close readings of the work of Faulkner, Caroline Gordon, Flannery O'Connor, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Joyce, and others. His general discussions of literature, giving new names to familiar concepts, are less original. JMM McKerney, Kathleen, ed. ON OUR OWN BEHALF: WOMEN'S TALES FROM CATALONIA.

Very often, books that attempt to guide the general reader to a national history or literature prove to be monotonous, mechanical, and superficial. This is certainly not the case, however, with this Dictionary, which proves to be an invaluable reference for those interested in Brazilian literature and culture. Stern's "Introduction: Brazilian Literature in Cultural Perspective" stresses an aspect thatin a sense defines Brazilian literature: the"constant self-evaluation and definition and self-redefinition and reevaluation of Brazil by Brazilian writers." The volume includes approximately three hundred entries of varying length, covering individual authors, literary themes and movements, sociocultural movements, and events relevant to literature. Each entry is followed by a bibliography which lists additional selected works, translations, and critical sources primarily in English.

After emigrating from Eastern Europe early in the century, both young men soon became major voices among a vast Yiddish readership in the United States and abroad. As personalities and poets they were strikingly different. Referring as necessary to biographical details, Wisse traces their individual poetic development not only in relation to the eccentricities of the Yiddish literary scene of the 1910s and 1920s but also to the socio- political dynamic of the Jewish immigrant population during-and after- those years. Although her perceptions on the two poets and their work is astute, the still greater value of her book inheres in its comprehensiveness, its illumination of the vibrant Yiddish-speaking culture during its heyday in America. For example, throughout her study, Wisse pays considerable attention to a group of writers called "the Yunge," tracing them from their original association with an ill-fated literary journal Di jugnt (Youth) in 1907-8 through their decline in the following two decades. Sympathetically and gracefully written, A Little Love in Big Manhattan exemplifies scholarship of the first order in its treatment of literary materials that have been largely inaccessible because of the Yiddish language barrier. Sanford E. Marovitz, Kent State University Ziolkowski, Margaret. HAGIOGRAPHYAND MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE. Princeton University Press, 1988. 265 pp. $34. In the best of erudite traditions, Ziokowski demonstrates the continuity between medieval and modern Russian literature and culture, concentrating on the impact of saints' lives (as exemplified in the Prolog and the Reading Menaea). She provides a historical background for the renewed appreciation of medieval Russia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a base for her study on the various ways in which writers throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries exploited hagiographical literature and its conventions of topoi and characterization. The author makes evident the extraordinary diversity among writers using hagiography for literary purposes, exploiting the genre's polemical bent to make political or social, or even plainly artistic statements: Dostoevski, Gorky, Leskov, Pasternak, Tolstoy, Uspenskii were all subject to its influences. Their adaptations could then be reworkings of legends into new hagiography or even into antihagiography. Ziolkowski follows chronologically the reworkings of the saint's lives by the Decembrist poets, the later adaptations from legends and tales, the recuperation of the saintly monk, the holy fool, and the Josephite type, through the assault on orthodoxy by the antihagiographers.

BENNETT, WELLS, AND CONRAD. NARRATIVE IN TRANSITION. St. Martin's Press, 1988. 231 pp. $29.95. The purpose of this book is to study the fictional procedures in the period leading from Victorian literature to Modernism. The choice of Bennett and Wells, two of the Edwardian novelists criticized in Virginia Woolf's famous essays, together with Conrad, who was always understood as someone covering new ground, is good strategy. Unfortunately, the results of Anderson's study are less valuable then they might have been. After an introduction concerning the aims and assumptions of realism, each of the three parts that follow consists of a section on the literary principles of one of the three writers followed by an account of some of his main novels. There is, however, no attempt to examine the novels in the light of the writer's general views expounded before the overview of each novel nor are-what is equally regrettable-Bennett's and Wells' literary practices compared to Conrad's. There are references to Bennett's opinions in the section on Wells' thinking, but even this does not suffice if we are to distinguish their techniques within the transitional process that the three authors share. As a consequence, although we learn something about their ideas concerning art and its relationship to society, this book hardly has anything new to offer about the nature of their texts.

LEWIS AND PAUL RICOEUR ON NARRATIVE TRANSFORMATION. University Press of America, 1988. 146 pp. $26.25. Ellmann, Maud. THE POETICS OF IMPERSONALITY: T.S. ELIOT AND EZRA POUND. HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1987. 207 pp. $22.50 With four chapters on Eliot and two on Pound, this is both a highly informed and vibrant book on the poets, and a book committed to engage critical theory in order to elucidate issues and contradictions in Modernism. The main issue is "impersonality," and Ellmann compares their theories to their practices-and to their practices over the decades in historical and personal contexts. There are several general findings: although both base their poetry on claims of impersonality, both resist it, and "their theory diverges from their practice, but the theory also 249</page><page sequence="64">G-5 COMPARATIVE STUDIES-TWO OR MORE AUTHORS contradicts itself" because, while both "dethrone" the author, both also "salvage... his former privilege." Ellmann makes extremely elegant and precise textual readings, especially of passages and poems which one has almost begun taking for granted, taking uncritically, or taking by habit, especially because one has substituted explanations for re-engaged experiences of them. Her interpretive apparatus is post-structuralist, working with multiple subject positions, disunity, non-narrative textures, splits between mastery and hesitation. She is very articulate about the encoding of interpretive acts and materials within poetic texts which, by their very nature, call for reading; so scenes of reading and writing, notions of silence, gap, and scavenged, partial meaning, citation, appropriation, pastiche, and phallus as logos are ideas of which she makes stunning use. She also offers precise applications of such Freudian concepts as "secondary revision," "the uncanny," "the fetish." At the end of the book, Ellmann suggests that the passage of both Eliot and Pound to conservative and authoritarian (fascist) politics is a political extension of the anti-liberal, anti-individualist claims in impersonality, and that, despite critical claims to the contrary, aesthetics cannot be separated from history. RBD Gardiner, Judith Kegan. RHYS, STEAD, LESSING, AND THE POLITICS OF EMPATHY. Indiana University Press, 1989. 186 pp. $32.50 cloth. $12.95 paper. Empathy, history, and female identity: these are the three interacting factors which Gardiner traces, first by examining the shorter fiction and then the masterworks of Rhys (Wide Sargasso Sea), Stead (The Man Who Loved Children), and Lessing (The Golden Notebook), and suggesting that each takes as its strategy the mother's daughter, the father's son, and the self-originating child, respectively. Despite each of these authors' "disclaimers of connection with organized feminism," Gardiner sees them all as perceiving women living in dystopian worlds and believing they can reach readers by engaging their empathy. Of course, this is nothing new. But Gardiner with her "politics of empathy" attempts to go further, discounting Barthes's notion that the "'writer is someone who plays with his mother's body,' that is, the mother tongue, 'in order to glorify it, to embellish it or in order to dismember it'" because the notion is too limiting and phallocentric. On the other hand, she argues, an "historically-grounded self-psychological literary criticism allows us to look at such fantasies of idealization, exhibitionism, and fragmentation, not in terms of the male self's metaphorical mastery over a prostrate maternal body, but in terms of the manifold dialogues we establish with literary texts and each other." Grounded in the psychologies of Kohut, Chodorow, Winnicott, and 250</page><page sequence="65">others, Gardiner provides useful strategies for bridging the gaps among reading, writing, and criticism.

INDIRECTIONS OF THE NOVEL: JAMES, CONRAD, AND FORSTER. Cambridge University Press, 1988. 225 pp. No price listed. Following an introduction that offers the general thesis that James, Conrad, and Forster responded to the uncertainty and change of their times by developing innovative fictional techniques of "openness, obliquity, and contradictoriness of narrative forms," this book then assesses at moderate length eleven specific novels. This is a thoroughly traditional study, stressing referentiality and the moral concerns of the writers. CR Green, Geoffrey. FREUD AND NABOKOV. University of Nebraska Press, 1988. 128 pp. $15.95. It is Geoffrey Green's intention here to psychoanalyze neither Nabokov nor his fiction. Rather he charts the ways in which Nabokov and Freud mutually inhabit the house of the mind, as the latter is seen in subjective and literary terms, the former in the theoretical terms of contemporary fiction. While Nabokov raged against Freud, creating merely a straw man, Green argues that Nabokov defined himself in relation to that created figure, the not-me of Freud's presence essential for the public Nabokov he shaped. Freud's understanding of the patient/analyst connection parallels the writer/reader relationship in texts that become reality itself, the case history of one being the fiction of the other. Parallels emerge. In "The Return of Chorb," for example, Nabokov creates an analogue to Freud's therapeutic process of recovering pathogenic trauma. In his autobiographical writings, he illustrates Freud's understanding that reality is unknowable, while both share the assumption that normality is fiction. Freud's self-analysis parallels such moments in Nabokov as the scene in Speak, Memory in which the son remembers a live father tossed by peasants but visually associated with his later death. For both, the past is unified by artistic memory, and remembered material is transformed into art or dreams. Both see in games the mastering of finite existence, and Nabokov's fascination with hostile doubling suggests Freud's own hostility in his relations with Adler, Jung, and Rank. All this is wonderfully suggestive. While the book is not always as clear as it might be (its twenty section divisions working against 251</page><page sequence="66">G-5 COMPARATIVE STUDIES-TWO OR MORE AUTHORS cohesiveness), it does suggest that the Viennese witch doctor, as Nabokov saw him, shares much with a companion whose dislike masked a kindred spirit.

Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1988. 170 pp. No price listed. Eight novels are given close readings in this thematically unified critical study: Murdoch's The Flight From the Enchanter, A Severed Head, and The Unicorn, Spark's The Ballad of Peckham Rye, The Public Image, and Not To Disturb, and Fowles' The Collector and The Magus. Kane's theme is announced in the third sentence of the book: "Searching for the good within the realms of the grotesque, Iris Murdoch, Muriel Spark, and John Fowles make significant moral statements by using a variety of demonic elements." His techniques of analysis rely upon conventional strategies for uncovering patterns of motive and meaning, and to the extent that they are lucid and respectful of the details of the text, they are both successful and useful. Because Kane assumes that all three of these novelists "teach moral lessons," however, he has a tendency to resolve ambiguities much too tidily. Of A Severed Head, for example, a work about whose ambiguous conclusion Murdoch herself has been evasive, Kane writes with assurance: "The demonic Honor Klein has done her didactic work and can now confront Martin as a real woman. The proof of Martin's growth lies in the ultimately perceptive 252</page><page sequence="67">narrative he has just composed." The decisiveness is somewhat refreshing (if not audacious) in these deconstructive times, but it is also misleading. Kane's book is best for the reader who is just beginning to find his or her way through the lanes of contemporary British fiction. RFS Lentricchia, Frank. ARIEL AND THE POLICE: MICHEL FOUCAULT, WILLIAM JAMES, WALLACE STEVENS. University of Wisconsin Press, 1988. 259 pp. $22.95. After Arnold, the opposition between culture and anarchy becomes in the American context the opposition between the liberal imagination and the stifling conventions of a provincial, domestic, commercial society. Lentricchia updates this opposition for Postmodern times, as suggested by the main title. "Ariel" stands for the liberation from all the narratives of traditional repression. From the jacket-flap: "Ariel: a medium of restorative power . . . the urge for liberation from narratives not our own. . . the self-revising pragmatist . . . a momentary music, a simultaneous she and he, a saturnalist, a spontaneity . .. a fragile space of freedom." "The Police" is a term standing for all the discursive forms that impose a single story and character-typology upon us all. Again from the jacket-flap: "The Police: a medium of coercive power that would turn subjects into objects, ministers of paranoia that would make subjects disappear into manageable narrative types like the Delinquent, the Filipino, the Male ... the Supreme Abstract Commander ... ' Based on this redefined traditional antithesis between individual aesthetic freedom and institutional authority, Lentricchia examines critically Foucault, James, and the movements of "new historicism" and "neo- pragmatism" which they have inspired in American criticism, and, at some length, the life and career of Wallace Stevens. The last, longest, and most important section of the book discusses Stevens's struggle to mediate between the coercive paradigm of American Maleness and Professional Success and his own unique sense of being a modern poet. Lentricchia fleshes out his defining allegorical opposition in his reading of Stevens, who provides the book's main title. Lentricchia also takes on the reductive feminist appropriations of modern poetry in general and of Stevens's poetry in particular. In opposition to feminist misreadings, Lentricchia argues that Stevens in his final work releases himself at last from the Police of his time in an exemplary act still worthy of our critical appreciation, an act that should cause us to revaluate all reductive critiques of modern poetry and poetics. In a brilliant concluding reading of "The World as Meditation," Lentricchia argues that the Penelope of the poem becomes Stevens's final interior paramour, a muse-self figure that refuses all the "fetchings" of the imperial imagination, preferring instead to embrace and be embraced by the simple arms of reality, the beams of the rising sun, the real figure for her ever-approaching, never-to-come-true dream of Ulysses. In this essay, Lentricchia demonstrates another sort of 253</page><page sequence="68">G-5 COMPARATIVE STUDIES-TWO OR MORE AUTHORS feminist reading, one not open to the charge of simply reversing the pattern of domination and putting the woman on top, but one instead revealing the poet's knowledge of the co-presence of male and female aspects in the self. Lentricchia not only redefines his critical position in this book, substituting a pragmatic aesthetic revisionism for his earlier resolutely anti-aesthetic neo-Marxism; he also takes on the American critical establishment in his severe critiques of its latest incarnations: new historicism, neo-pragmatism, and essentialist feminism. In his attempt to save the Ariel in every subject for history, Lentricchia displays a critical power and style worthy of serious reflection. DTO MacNiven, lan S., ed.

The University of Massachusetts Press, 1988. 235 pp. $20. While the subjects of this volume enjoyed a productive literary relationship, especially early in their respective careers, they never developed any personal intimacy. This book seeks to explain this failure. Based on their early works, correspondence, unpublished archival materials, and interviews with Lukacs, Katja Mann, Ernst Block, and several other intimates, this book argues persuasively that Lukfcs is the model for Leo Naphta, the Jewish intellectual in The Magic Mountain, and that this "ideal type" is consistently portrayed in Mann's work as ironically containing a "Totalitarian" personality inspired by radicalism, rigidity, dogmatism, and asceticism-all negative traits which Mann found in this type's real-life original. More a biographical than sociological study, despite the use of Weber's concept of "ideal types," Marcus's study is a lucid and useful contribution to the analysis of modern intellectuals.

VANISHING LIVES: STYLE AND SELF IN TENNYSON, D.G. ROSSETTI, SWINBURNE, AND YEATS. University Press of Virginia, 1988. 240 pp. $32.50. A study of the "Tennysonian way" in nineteenth-century British poetry, this volume also demonstrates how the aesthetics of disappearing selves and worlds-really, a vision given definitive expression by Pater's moody celebrations of momentary flashes of form amidst the flux-perfectly captures the late Victorian ethos. Moreover, in his fine section on Yeats (the final four of the book's eleven chapters), Richardson writes an original and sympathetic appreciation of the Celtic Twilight phase. Finally, in the concluding two chapters of this section, he shows how the Victorian ethos of "vanishing lives" continues to inform Yeats's greatest later poems, and through them, much of the rest of modern poetry. In this book, Richardson, a poet and Director of the Creative Writing Program at Princeton, has given us a first-rate study of the period of transition in British poetry from Victorian to Modernist aesthetics.

"I propose a radical shift from the 'textual' approach to the search for common ground in the study of myth: not just 'text,' but text in context, informed by intention." And so he sets out to provide the contexts-personal, intellectual, political-in which they developed their theories. It is a fascinating study, especially when the subjects are Eliade in the Romania of the Iron Guard and Levi-Strauss between Surrealism and Communism. But aside from a discussion of the "magic realist" novels written by Eliade, there is little here of direct literary significance. MPL Wood, Ralph C. THE COMEDY OF REDEMPTION: CHRISTIAN FAITH AND COMIC VISION IN FOUR AMERICAN NOVELISTS. University of Notre Dame, 1988. 310 pp. $32.95. Zurbrugg, Nicholas. BECKETT AND PROUST. Colin Smythe/Barnes and Noble, 1988. 313 pp. No price listed. Making use not only of Beckett's annotated edition of A la recherche du temps perdu but also of his comments on his own Proust, Zurbrugg argues forcefully and convincingly for a reassessment of that "eccentric essay" and its place in the Beckett canon. Most critics, he insists, take Beckett at his word when he speaks of Proust and, as a result, "successively misrepresent Beckett's vision, Proust's vision, and the complex relationship between their respective visions . . . " Beckett himself displays in the essay an "inexplicable indifference to the positive dimensions" of Proust's novel and "systematically misrepresents Proust's vision by reducing it to Beckettian terms." Zurbrugg's Proust is far more positive than Beckett's, a reading which serves as justification and support for the latter's own early fictions. But even in the late works, with their "unashamedly elegiac tone"-perhaps misled by the earlier critical comments-we tend to confuse rhetoric and content and thus may miss the point about both Beckett and Proust. "In retrospect, life in the Beckettian 'dark' offers precisely the same pattern as that which Beckett's Proust imputes to A la recherche du temps perdu: the movement of a 'pendulum' which 'oscillates between . . . Suffering . . . and Boredom."' Correcting the imbalance, as Zurbrugg urges, we may find ourselves reading both a new Beckett and a new Proust. MPL C Axlerod, Mark Richard.

Barricelli divides his collection of twenty-four essays (half of them published between 1956 and 1985, the other half new) into three main areas: literature and music (subjects common to both fields), (uses of) music in literature and (uses of) literature in music.

THE UTOPIAN FUNCTION OF ART AND LITERATURE: SELECTED ESSAYS. Trans. Jack Zipes and Frank Mecklenburg, MIT Press, 1988. 310 pp. $25. This long-overdue translation makes available some of the voluminous writing of Ernst Bloch (1885-1977), a German philosopher whose unorthodox Marxist approach is attracting new interest among political literary theorists. Bloch's great topic is the utopian element in human cul- ture-not the illusory "embellishment" that transcends hierarchical social relations by concealing them, but the "anticipatory illumination" of a socialist society which does not yet exist but can nonetheless be glimpsed in the present. Assuming that all cultural products express a "hope" for a "better life," Bloch develops a concept of truth which radically revises realist representation: "Truth is ultimately the demonstration of the tendency and latency of what has not yet developed and needs its agent." Seen from the current situation in which poststructuralism is forcing a reconsideration of basic Marxist concepts, Bloch's aesthetics contains traces of an earlier, humanistic brand of Marxism. At the same time, however, Bloch is close to contemporary trends in arguing against any economistic reduction of culture, in respecting the specificity of genres, and in theorizing formal fragmentation as most revealing of utopian meanings because "the course of the world is still undecided, unended." By formulating a hermeneutic which seeks anticipations of socialism, Bloch can recover even a reactionary cultural heritage for a Marxist political agenda. Jack Zipes's Introduction helpfully situates Bloch's work in the context of twentieth-century developments, and his selection of essays and excerpts is representative of Bloch's varied interests: several theoretical statements of key ideas are followed by more specific studies of music, art, architecture, literature, and popular culture. The translation which Zipes has written with Frank Mecklenburg is lucid and highly readable, making this book a perfect introduction to Bloch's magnum opus, The Principle of Hope (also recently translated).

Harvard University Press, 1988. 124 pp. No price listed. Both the title and the expressed intent of these lectures have an uncanny import because Six Memos for the Next Millennium are but five of the projected Charles Eliot Norton Lectures to have been presented at Harvard had Italo Calvino lived to deliver them. These essays specify the qualities which Calvino most admired in literature: lightness, quickness, exactitude, visibility, and multiplicity. Each of these qualities permits or even embodies its opposite, as do Calvino's own works, because he was ever attracted to paradox. Thus the lightness of precision, abstraction, and emblematic conciseness is compatible with gravity. Pleasure in the quick epigram abides with savor in lingering. Only exact attention to detail yields the beauty of the indefinite. The work of the imagination is to render visible what is not present. Admired novelists express "the tension between mathematical exactitude and the imprecision of human affairs ...." The last of the lectures poses a speculative challenge for a novel which experiments with point of view: "Think what it would be to have a work conceived from outside the self, a work that would let us escape the limited perspective of the individual ego ...." In some sense, granted the ghostly nature of Calvino's presence outside this text (the titles of his projected lecture appear on a photographic reproduction, the title of the sixth an erasure which faintly reads "Consistency"), he has achieved the non-fiction equivalent to his millennial project. Calvino has left us with a spirited trace. Mary E. Hazard, Drexel University Caws, Peter. STRUCTURALISM: THE ART OF THE INTELLIGIBLE. Contemporary Studies in Philosophy and the Human Sciences. Humanities Press International, 1988. 276 pp. $45. Caws's book has a double plan: its first part "deals with structuralism historically and critically, as a movement, the second deals with it systematically as philosophy." The first succeeds admirably well in uncovering the roots of structuralism in both European and American philosophy and anthropology, then in analyzing the influence of the "linguistic turns" upon the "human sciences" in general. The second, and more important, part of the book suffers from the kinds of confusions, contradictions, and weak assumptions that plague most "structuralist" thought. Although Caws defends (somewhat oddly) the integrity of the beleaguered "subject," he insists that "foundationalism" in all knowledge must be abandoned, that "we are . . . 'freely suspended in [epistemo- logical] space,"' and that "What we need is not an umbilical cord to some impossible origin . . . but . . . devices for local orientation, limited 264</page><page sequence="79">structural connections of optimum complexity. .. ." He is of two minds about where those devices come from; on p. 159, they are not "given" but "constructed"; yet later, on p. 207, we are told that thought proceeds less by the invention than by the recognition of intelligible structure"; and finally, on p. 236, we are back to the first position: "What mind does is to add to the world." But physicists, writes Caws, do not add to the world, since they deal, according to his surprisingly naive formulation, with "mind-independent entities." We nonscientists always do, though, and it is only because of our "common circumstances and experience" that there is anything like "approximate similarities" attaching to our perceptions of things. Never mind that all of our individual minds are formed, as Caws concedes, "on a common neurological basis genetically determined" and that "It is on the affective side that the primitive proto-logic that preceded the articulation of language is to be looked for": these fruitful admissions are quickly dropped out of sight. Structuralism, of Caws's stripe and others', has yet to face modern science and come of age. RFS Clifford, James. THE PREDICAMENT OF CULTURE: TWENTIETH-CENTURY ETHNOGRAPHY, LITERATURE, AND ART.

MARXISM AND LITERARY HISTORY. Basil Blackwell, 1988. 275 pp. $15.95 paper. Frow uses a poststructuralist theorization of literary discourse to develop a methodology by which literary history can serve Marxist cultural politics. He proceeds indirectly at first, through a critique of various Marxist theorists (notably Lukacs, Althusser, Macherey, Jameson, and Eagleton), arguing against earlier notions that literary discourse can offer a transparent or unmediated representation of a social or historical reality. Drawing on poststructuralist concepts of textuality elaborated by theorists such as Derrida, Foucault, and Kristeva, Frow constructs the text as an extremely heterogeneous object, a node of intertextuality within a discursive formation housed in cultural institutions which at once enable and constrain textual production as well as interpretation and evaluation. Frow's "concept of history does not carry the sense of an enfolding narrative continuum or of the given ground of human action. It is used to 266</page><page sequence="81">theorize the discontinuous, nonteleological dynamic of the literary system and the multiple temporalities of texts within complex sets of intertextual relations." The historicity of the text is two-fold: it emerges in the text's appropriation and transformation of discursive materials, but also in its own transformative appropriation by critical discourses. Frow follows Tony Bennett in arguing that Marxism can politicize literary discourse by engaging not only with texts, but with the institutional constraints on their circulation and reception, producing interpretations which "break with a dominant regime of reading and with the institutional context of reading which directly or indirectly sustains this regime." Frow's lucidly written book is a valuable introduction to current debates in Marxist literary theory. He usefully shows how poststructuralism can help Marxist literary critics rethink crucial questions such as the ideology of literary form; and his theoretical concepts are implemented in provocative readings of varied texts-including prose by Petronius, Don DeLillo, Robert Ludlum, the Australian writer Frank Hardy, poetry by Holderlin, and poetry translations by Dryden, Lattimore, and Chris- topher Logue. Yet some readers sympathetic to Frow's political agenda will find his notion of "the social order" rather atrophied: for him it hinges on the qualification of social agents for discursive practices in institutions, so that class as a socioeconomic category is all but eclipsed, and the ideological determinations of texts, their affiliations with specific social groups, are vaguely defined in his illustrative readings. And yet, despite Frow's emphasis on textuality and institution, he writes at points as if an economic level, the "capitalist mode of production," were present with all its monstrous effectivity in post-World War II culture, particularly in the mass-media "simulation" which, following Baudrillard, he cites as a distinctive feature of consumer capitalism. In the end, it is clear that any effort to theorize an oppositional cultural politics today must still confront unresolved questions concerning the relations between "text" and "history."

The University of Chicago Press, 1987. 325 pp. Price not listed. 267</page><page sequence="82">G-6 CRITICISM OF MODERN LITERATURE GENERALLY In common with his first book On the Grotesque, this study adopts a comprehensive cross-cultural, cross-disciplinary, broadly historical, and theoretically informed approach. Moreover, this book displays the same combination of lucid style, scholarly allusion, and vacuity of critical formulation. The book also displays, in the Nietzsche and Foucault chapters, an unexpected capacity for self-serving and self-congratulatory misreadings that only Harold Bloom could match. Harpham defines "the ascetic imperative" so generally, as "structures of resistance"-to temptation, to others, to one's own desires-that it becomes equivalent not only to Western culture, but to the idea of culture itself. Surprisingly, given this general formulation, Freud (its obvious father) while discussed in passing, does not receive an entire chapter treatment, unlike Nietzsche and Foucault, who do and whose ideas on the ascetic priest and the disciplinary society are more particularized and dialectically nuanced than Freud's position in such later works as Civilization and Its Discontents-or than Harpham's position here. The Nietzsche chapter can serve as a case in point. Harpham, realizing that On the Genealogy of Morals anticipates all the particulars he has to offer, claims, as Nehamas or Derrida might put it, that this text embodies and performs what it says about the "self-overcoming" nature of all great things on earth: that is, that in the end they overcome even themselves. On this basis, Harpham goes even further by concluding that his text offers "continually new interpretations" which only "obscure and even obliterate their predecessors"-a telling, self-betraying remark if ever there was one. Harpham wraps up his analysis by claiming that, by the end of this text, Nietzsche "can say anything." Here Harpham deploys once again the old charge of Nietzsche's incoherence and self-contradiction, a charge long ago raised by Jaspers and Danto and also long ago dispelled by Heidegger and Kaufmann. Although Harpham quibbles with Nietzsche's historically limited formulation of "the ascetic ideal" and the latter's focus on the historical role of the ascetic priest-preferring his own more general formula "the ascetic imperative," which suggests the Kantian universal moral faculty of the categorical imperative, and his own transhistorical focus on culture itself, which discloses nothing concrete-Nietzsche's analyses here actually inform whatever is useful in Harpham's argument. Because Nietzsche understands ancient culture, especially that of the Greeks, as embodying an antithetical cultural ideal, one in which Dionysian art has the highest place, he is able to analyze Judeo-Christian culture and its secular avatar in devastatingly particular terms. Because Harpham has no such opposing affirmative position, he must universalize our fate and make it the fate of culture itself. Consequently, like his first book, this one is a considerable failure, too. DTO 268</page><page sequence="83">Hart, Clive. IMAGES OF FLIGHT.

Harvard University Press, 1988. $22.50. In this volume, Herrnstein-Smith combines and extends three earlier article-length studies, the most famous of which-"Contingencies of Value" (1983)-forms the cornerstone of her axiological theory. For the author, "Evaluation is always compromised because value is always in motion . . . it is constantly variable and eternally indeterminate." She offers as evidence an engaging history of her ill-fated attempts to reach a final conclusion about the value of Shakespeare's sonnets, given the contingencies of her own experience with them. Clearly, Herrnstein-Smith applauds the attempt to evaluate while simultaneously denying the possibility of summary judgment. She notes the demise in general of the kind of evaluative literary criticism practiced by Samuel Johnson, Matthew Arnold, and T.S. Eliot, and blames Northrop Frye for exiling evaluative criticism to the backwaters of contemporary scholarship, even as he left unquestioned traditional canonical standards of taste. Hoping to rescue the' field of literary studies from its interpretive preoccupations and its canonical assumptions, Herrnstein-Smith proposes an alternative project, one that would clarify the nature of literary value in conjunction with general reconsiderations of the concept of "value." This project is ambitious and fraught with dangers of misrepresentation, not the least of which is the charge of moral quietism that has resulted from the author's committment to relativism. She answers this charge at the end by arguing persuasively that her relativism is not a "position" in the objectivist sense of the term, but rather a "general conceptual style or taste." Herrnstein- Smith supports the wide-spread revision of the canon that has taken place since her project began in 1979; and this volume-dense with analyses of Hume, Kant, Bourdieu, Habermas, and Bataille-suggests a theoretical framework for further revisionist activity.

Of the seventeen reprinted essays in this collection of occasional pieces of America's leading neo-Marxist theorist, only five-two essays in volume one and three in volume two-can be considered still important and undated. These are: "The Ideology of the Text," "Imaginary and Symbolic in Lacan" (the best single explanation of this difficult revisionary psychoanalytic theorist), "The Politics of Theory: Ideological Positions in the Postmodernism Debate," "Beyond the Cave: Demystifying the Ideology of Modernism," and "Periodizing the 60s." Long, comprehensive, sometimes provocative and intellectually exciting, these essays would have made a significant single volume. Scattered amidst the disposable pieces over two volumes, they are almost lost. Jameson's importance, which these essays underscore, lies in his theory of the political unconscious, which is most fully elaborated in his 1981 book of the same name. By this, Jameson means the unthought totality of ideological significance that one can read from the aesthetic or formal distortions, gaps, or contradictions in extended prose narratives, and especially in novels. In these essays in particular we see him either in the process of developing this theory or of applying it to other areas of modern culture or even to entire periods in cultural history. The way Postmodern, in contrast to Modern, architecture arranges space, for example, speaks to him volumes about the repressed political dimension of twentieth-century high and popular cultures. Similarly, the theoretical positions of critics, such as the abstruse poetics of Stevens, also betray the political unconscious. This allegorization of what remains unsaid or unthought in a text or a cultural event often proves to be insightful and provocative, a necessary corrective to the generalizations of New Critical and other formalist approaches. The problem with this particular ritual of allegorization goes beyond the ultimately routine predictability of any allegorization. Despite the 270</page><page sequence="85">historical orientation of his neo-Marxist theory, Jameson rarely demonstrates concretely the connections that he asserts between one tex- tual level and another, or one cultural area and the economy or an entire society. An assumed and all-too-easy homology between the fields of analysis does the critical work of mediation for him in advance of his elaboration. For example, Jameson claims of Stevens that his "poetic 'tota- lity' begins to trace a ghostly mimesis or analogon of the totality of the imperialist world system itself, with [its] third world materials in a similarly strategic, marginal, yet essential place . . . . [Stevens's] very unconscious replication of the 'real' totality of the world system in the mind is then what allows culture to separate itself as a closed and self- sufficient system in its own right: reduplication, and at the same time, floating about the real. It is an impulse shared by most of the great high modernisms, as has been shown most dramatically in the recent critiques of architectural modernism, in particular of the international style ... Whether or not this is true of Stevens, it reads like a blueprint of Jameson's own conscious method of producing the political unconscious as a ghostly simulacrum of the "real" totality from the texts under discussion. Jameson does not so much argue and exemplify as slip and slide, associatively, from one claim to another, rarely bothering to demonstrate or even fully to articulate them. In part, this is a failure in "style"-Jameson's, is notoriously lumbering. But it is also a failure of knowledge. It is not that Jameson knows too little. It is how he knows. He thinks solely in categories and blocks of knowledge, in types and stereotypes. In this failing he can be rightly called the radical intellectual's Northrop Frye. Despite these problems, however, his is an influential position no critic of twentieth-century literature and culture can afford to ignore. DTO Kermode, Frank.

"Part One: Bourgeois Literature in the Thirties" discusses intelligently, personally, and in some detail the formative impact of this literary generation upon modern English culture and politics. Particularly moving is Kermode's recovery of once influential, now neglected minor figures from the period, such as Edward Upward. Kermode's discussion of The Spiral Ascent is especially poignant. In this part, Kermode practices his own brand of "new historicism": sensitive, pragmatic, apolitical, appreciative yet discriminating. "Part Two: History and Value" is unfortunately a disappointment in comparison. Kermode here attempts to apply his theory of canon- formation and aesthetic value from Forms of Attention (1986) to counter neo-Marxist and Postmodernist critical approaches to the problem (belon- ging to earlier eras) of value in work. There are two kinds of failure in this part. The first arises from his lack of intimate acquaintance with 271</page><page sequence="86">G-6 CRITICISM OF MODERN LITERATURE GENERALLY contemporary materials and positions. In an aside, for example, Kermode claims that Woolf's Between the Acts has "not yet" been "claimed for the Postmodernist de-canon." This is of course snidely and absurdly put. But it is also simply wrong. If Kermode had done his homework better, he would have discovered several important discussions of this novel in terms of its prefigurations of Postmodernism. See, for one such example, Alan Wilde, Horizons of Assent: Modernism, Postmodernism, and the Ironic Imagination. The second failure is even more serious, since it is a failure in imagination. In his concluding description of canon-formation, Kermode depoliticizes and generalizes the process, so that while no one could disagree with his gist, everyone would still disagree on all the important questions. Kermode is here, perhaps willfully, refusing to see the point of recent canon-revisions: Some sort of canon, however variable, makes such determinations [of "major" and "minor" figures] possible in literature .... It may not be, on some God's-eye view, wholly just; if it is a good thing it is only humanly so .... [On] the whole we accept the necessity of neglect, and of fashions in neglect, as the price of ensuring that there may be some values reasonably proof against them .... But there is no magic by which immanent value ensures survival; that depends on our ability so to construct history that the valued object stands out from the unvalued and belongs to a totality of literature rather than to an archive of hopelessly diverse documents. Perhaps the best image for the way we endow with value this and not that memory is Proust's novel: out of the indeterminate, disject facts of history, a core of canonical memory; out of history, value. If there is one lesson that recent theory should have brought home to everyone by now it is that the process of canon-formation is never innocent; it is political through and through, and it matters who is selecting and what standards they are using. Proust's memory is not neces- sarily the standard for his valet's. Moreover, this politics of canon- formation is usually automatic, performed by critics on the basis of patterns of discourse and values that generally remain unconscious or self- evident, virtually anonymous, impersonal, and open to dispute only thanks to highly articulated collective opposition. Simply because there are always going to be canons selected by fallible human beings does not even begin to address the major questions of whose canons are going to be handed down, and how this is to be done. The question of value is a question of value for some collectivity or other that currently disseminates power. Kermode cannot even envision a response to this situation that either would defend the traditional canon or advance an opposing canon. All he can do is say, in effect, since there has to be a canon, why not this one. This is poor riposte, to say the least. DTO 272</page><page sequence="87">Kettle, Arnold.

Purdue University Press, 1988. 371 pp. $12.95 paper. Predicting the future of literary theory has recently become something of a growth industry-one that speaks, no doubt, to some of the anxieties about criticism's present. Of all the recent essay collections on this subject, this one is surely the most qualified, for among its contributors are Jonathan Culler, Stanley Fish, Ren6 Girard, Frederic Jameson, Frank Lentricchia, Patrocinio Schweickart, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. The tone of the collection is set by Culler's suggestion that criticism should serve as the touchstone for an interdisciplinary approach to reading texts. The exemplars of this proposal are Lentricchia's report on the William James revival, Spivak's analysis of the tropological aspects of gender criticism, Caryl Emerson, and Gary Saul Morson's excellent summary of Bakhtin's writings, as well as Virgil Lokke's interesting comparison between Bakhtin and Jacobson. While none of these essays may entirely calm the current anxieties about literary theory, this volume gives an excellent appraisal of the various directions to which theory is heading. Richard M.

This splendidly edited volume comes out of a group of courses held in 1983 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, followed by a 274</page><page sequence="89">large international conference. It also includes additionally solicited essays and extracts from the disscussions following some of the papers as they were delivered. In the thirty-seven contributions-each preceded by a helpful brief summary extracted from the essay-the various topics are approached from the perspective of an up-to-date nondogmatic Marxism which has absorbed the methods and discourses of many modern trends in the social sciences and culture criticism. Some contributions, admittedly, are still closer to the language-but not to the limiting doctrines-of an earlier generation. Etienne Balibar's essay on the vacillation of ideology is a key point of reference for the wide range of issues dealt with in the volume, from the rethinking of the crisis in Marxism, through discussions of Modernity and Postmodernity, and of contemporary trends in science, politics, ethics, to the strategies of aesthetic interpretation. Culture is seen as a field of human activity in which capitalist hegemony gives rise to various forms of power struggle and resistance. The Latin American scene, pop music, feminism, present-day forms of communication-these are some of the areas dealt with, alas, in styles that are rarely witty and elegant and sometimes highly forbidding. Whereas all the essays are at least indirectly pertinent to literature because they discuss various aspects of its context, only some of them-on Empson (T. Eagleton), Max Raphael (M. Barrett), Hispanic American Poetry (H. Achugar), Narrative Agents (D. Suvin), and Marxist Criticism in China (F. Wang)-deal with literary issues directly. The contributors from many countries (America, Europe and one from China) include such internationally important names as Eagleton, Jameson, Lefebvre and, Spivak. IV Nordloh, David, ed.

University of California Press, 1988. 343 pp. + illus. $40. "The governing premise of this study," Patterson states, "is that there are no right answers, only interpretations." Hence, she eschews any treatment of pastoral as a generic essence, stable over national boundaries and historical change, and rather considers the complex reception of a pastoral text that has held enormous interest for Western writers and readers: Virgil's Eclogues. Beginning with the highly influential commentary by the fourth-century grammarian Servius, Patterson shows how shifting ideological assumptions have governed the cultural uses to which Virgil's poems have been put. Her wide range of materials includes not only commentaries, imitations, and quotations, but also editions, translations, and illustrations. Among the writers are Petrarch, Vives, Marot, Spenser, Voltaire, Goldsmith, Wordsworth, Gide, and Frost; among the artists, Simone Martini, Sebastian Brant, Jacques-Louis David, 275</page><page sequence="90">G-6 CRITICISM OF MODERN LITERATURE GENERALLY Caspar David Friedrich, Samuel Palmer, and Jacques Villon. Patterson's method is to embed close analyses in historical narratives, offering sensitive readings that construe cultural forms as interventions in specific social situations. The broad scope of her project, spanning centuries and drawing on literatures in several languages, enables her to question dominant period divisions and canons, refining concepts like "Renaissance humanism" and "Neoclassicism" and calling attention to such neglected figures as the seventeenth-century translator John Ogilby. She illuminates modern versions of pastoral by establishing their continuity with Romanti- cism (pastoral as "interior landscape") and by distinguishing them from the contemporary, postmodern concern with cultural politics. Aware that her ambitious attempt to cover so much ground is likely to disappoint specialists, Patterson notes that her book "depends less on the depth or intricacy of individual 'readings' than on a network of connections and cross-references that stretch from the first chapter to the last." And this indeed points to what is perhaps her most important contribution. For one of her recurrent themes is how intellectuals at different times and places used Virgil's pastoral poems to "define themselves, their sanctions and functions." The fact is that Patterson is doing the same for academic critics today: her use of the pastoral challenges, in a cogent way, the disciplinary boundaries which have become entrenched in the profession and discourages the political committment she brings to the study of culture. This is a brave, exemplary book, elegantly written, beautifully published. LV Patterson, David. THE AFFIRMING FLAME: RELIGION, LANGUAGE, LITERATURE.

A READER'S DELIGHT. University Press of New England, 1988. 208 pp. $15.95 cloth, 9.95 paper. The Common Reader, rather like the casual essay, may be an endangered species in an age with increasingly rarified tastes in critical theory and literary texts, but A Reader's Delight, a collection of forty brief essays on neglected masterpieces that appeared originally in the Washington Post Book World, makes a persuasive case for the independent reading and old-fashioned pleasure. As Perrin argues, the "classics" can take care of themselves, thank you very much; so too can those works that, for better or worse, have achieved academic respectability. What interests him are the books "just short of classic status that are known only to a handful of 276</page><page sequence="91">lucky readers." Almost anyone who reads a great deal, Perrin claims, is apt to have "come across at least one such book-something not in the canon, not famous, probably not even in print-but all the same, sheer delight to read. Many lifelong readers have a whole collection of such books." In effect, this book is a sampling from Perrin's own eclectic, widely- ranging collection. Among his favorites one can find George Ade's Fables in Slang (1899) and Ernest Bramah's Kai Lung's Golden Hours (1922); Kenkos's Essays in Idleness (1932) and W.N.P. Barbellion's The Journal of a Disappointed Man (1919). Perrin is clearly a man not frightened by the serendipitous. A dusty book come upon by sheer accident might strike one's fancy and remain a lifelong friend. And as for the "rules" that governed Perrin's newspaper column and this collecton, there were just two: "No book less than about fifteen years old was eligible. Younger than that is current work, not a possible classic. And no book that more than two or three of my colleagues had read got considered. It would have been foolish to waste space on work that most people already knew." Occasionally Perrin's enthusiasms get him into trouble, as happens when he claims that Henry Adams's novel Democracy is "the best political novel yet written in America" (there are those, including myself, who would reserve that particular honor for Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men), or when he bills James Gould Cozzens's Guard of Honor as "The Best American Novel About World War II." But most of the time Perrin remains the same witty, delightful human stylist many of us know as the author of First Person Rural. He makes his shelf of choices sound interesting, inviting, and valuable. That he also provides information about where one can buy them is an additional delight in a collection filled with them.

In this book, Siebers demonstrates how particular theories or schools of literary criticism have justified, ethically, their theoretical choices. Examining the ways in which these choices have affected the relations between literature and the lives of human beings, shaping definitions of literature and human nature, he proposes that ethics and criticism consistently join on two issues: the character of criticism (the ethical attitudes behind critical claims and those engendered by critical stance), and the preoccupation with political or social conflicts. He addresses the extent to which a selected group of theorists defines ethical thought, and the coherence implicit in today's diversity of critical approaches, tracing a genealogy of modern critical theory. He pursues those issues in essays on Plato and pluralism, Kant and the New Critics, Levi-Strauss and Derrida, the Romantics and de Man, Nietzsche and Girard, Freud and Lacan, the various critics of sexual difference, and the deconstructionists and nuclear critics.

Of the seven essays by various hands, including Samuel Weber, David Carroll and J. Hillis Miller, and the editors' Introduction, Derrida's piece is the only one of even mild interest. The other performances seem tired and labored, as if going through the deconstructive motions just one too many times now. Derrida's performance concerns the interplay of change and determinism in psychoanalysis as exemplified in both Freud's Psychopathology of Everyday Life and Derrida's own wandering, associative, Shandy-like discourse. This volume is of some interest to those critics who still wish to keep up with Derrida's late career. DTO Smith, Paul. DISCERNING THE SUBJECT. Foreward John Mowitt.

This is a collection of "pieces"-"essays, introductions, lectures, and a radio talk, along with some unpublished papers"-possessing "no continuity or binding theme." Instead, they are the "meditations, interpretations, explorations" of their author, covering the period 1961- 1986. Most of this material deals with nineteenth-century American literature, but the last third of the book also discusses a group of contemporary writers, including Pynchon, Barth, Barthelme, De Lillo, and Gass. Despite the author's disclaimer, there is, as the title suggests, a unifying concern expressed here: a repeated interrogation of the American writer's different sense of language. Although not a major scholarly contribution to current debates about "New Americanist" revisions of the canon, this collection-another volume in the Cambridge Studies in American Literature and Culture Series under the general editorship of Albert Gelpi- is a refreshingly engaged and independent consideration from an English critic in the best Johnsonian mode.

University of Minnesota Press, 1987. 225 pp. $29.50 cloth, $12.95 paper. Apart from the alliteration, Holderlin, Hegel, and Heidegger share a strange mixture of lucidity and obscurity which is the despair of every translator. As if their notorious difficulties were not enough, Warminski piles on those of Nietzsche, de Man, and Derrida in his attempt to explore the relation between philosophy and literature. Warminski's method of reading avoids the dangers of reductionism and focuses on the "unreadability" of the texts under examination. If they can be illumined at all, it is by a dialectical process of reflexion, of mirroring Hegel in the 279</page><page sequence="94">G-6 CRITICISM OF MODERN LITERATURE GENERALLY light of Heidegger's philosophy and Heidegger in the light of Hegel's philosophy. The fundamental figure of speech and of thought in this process is chiasmos, a kind of conceptual and linguistic M6bius band. This is no book for readers impatient with the intricacies of German transcendentalism; but for those with an interest in this philosophical tradition and in H6lderlin, "the poet's poet," it is a must.

The most remarkable aspect of this mammoth reflection of the "ethics of fiction" is that despite its liberal pretense to comprehensiveness and its 281</page><page sequence="96">G-7 CRITICISM OF FICTION pluralistic pose of fairness, it fails to engage in any systematic substantial debate with the major obstacle to its humanistic faith in the moral power of literature, viz., the later work of Paul de Man. For despite his recently revealed past of collaborating with repressive powers, the later de Man is still unsurpassed in his analytic understanding of the essentially "amoral" rhetorical power of fictionality in all its manifestations: aesthetic, political, philosophical, theoretical, and so on. The later de Man makes it impossible for anyone to elaborate a critical position based on the unexamined metaphors that essentially constitute it. This is why Booth fails to confront the later de Man at any length. For Booth wants us to accept his title metaphor: that in reading fiction we "keep" (that is, both pass the time with and preserve) the "company" of great authors and their memorable characters and works. Surely, this belief is itself a fiction doing ideological work. Reading is at its best the solitary act of an alienated understanding of the structures of rhetoric and their power to shape and contain action within predetermined conventional norms. But in order to develop his view-really overdevelop it through five hundred plus pages of dithering prose-Booth must avoid de Man's provocative challenge at all costs. This is a bloated monument to the bankrupt tradition of critical humanism by one of its most celebrated American spokesmen, who is now at the end of his long vain career of evading all the hard questions.

The title of this book may be misleading. It seems to indicate a particular aspect of some recent fiction, yet it has no such ambition. The phrase is a metaphorical expression denoting the richness of narrative forms in our time that prevents the critic from reducing the existing variety to a determined number of categories. In a similar way the "reading" is not an 282</page><page sequence="97">indication of a rigorous and consistent methodology. What saves the book from being a collection of impressionistic essays is the author's academic bent. She amply recounts the events in each of the works that she deals with and offers clear descriptions of the novels' techniques. Thus her guide through the latest (or recent) writings of Graham Greene, G. Garcia Mirquez, Borges, Nabokov, Calvino, Beckett, Eco, Spark, Russell Hoban, Murdoch, Bellow, Ozick, and Lessing, is very useful to those seeking surface information on any among these fifteen-odd writers who "represent a part of that puzzling labyrinth that is contemporary fiction." The more so does one miss structural or narratological comparisons on a deeper level and regrets the "arbitrary boundaries" of the book that the author appears to think of as one of its virtues.

The book was conceived to fulfill a need- for a collection of essays on the theory of fiction for college and university courses. (No collection of essays on fiction theory has been published in the last ten years, the editors note.) The criteria of selection followed were: "(1) those texts traditionally considered 'classics,' (2) those that represent the various concerns of the most important scholars and thinkers, (3) those that are the best in their quality of thought and exposition, (4) those that are the most readable and well written." And the essays selected can be justified 283</page><page sequence="98">G-7 CRITICISM OF FICTION according to these ground rules-it is a solid collection. Some classics are missing, such as Northrup Frye and Norman Friedman on point of view, but others remain, and it is helpful to have a collection which includes Genette, Prince, Chatman, and Todorov as well as some examples of feminist criticism, such as that of Rachel DuPiessis. The essays are presented chronologically, a practice particularly helpful to those interested in the evolution of fiction theory. The regular table of contents is then followed by a topical one, grouping the articles under headings such as character, plot, and point of view, for the reader interested in a particular area of criticism. Three essays are included on the novella and short story. There are thirty selections in all, each with a thoughtful introduction of about a page. This appears to be a sensible number of essays to include; it achieves a good balance between the completeness of the selection and a reasonable length for each piece.

Kaplan, Amy. THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF AMERICAN REALISM. University of Chicago, 1988. 187 pp. No price listed. Kaplan's study of American realism goes beyond the terms initially established by Chase and Trilling, terms which have dominated discussion for decades: instead of viewing realism as a vaguely un-American genre, as against the more successful native effort of "romance," the author argues for the importance of writers such as Howells, Wharton, and Dreiser. Thus, Kaplan portrays a dialectic within the works she analyzes-A Hazard of New Fortunes, The House of Mirth, and Sister Carrie-by which the conflicts of social class, mass media, and a new consumer society are complexly realized. Contradictions in the works reflect contradictions in the society as a whole, as the writers under consideration seek to define the boundaries of social class and to situate themselves as serious artists within an ever more powerful mass culture. As Kaplan states, "Realists do more than passively record the world outside; they actively create and criticize the meanings, representations, and ideologies of their own changing culture." This is an important study, useful not only for its specific discussions of Howells, Wharton, and Dreiser, but for establishing a fruitful approach to realism that profitably directs our attention to the writer's social role in negotiating the contradictions of historical reality.

The Art of the Novel, like all but one of Kundera's novels, is divided into seven parts. The Czech novelist who now lives in France comments on this phenomenon as involving "a deep, unconscious, incomprehensible drive, an archetype of form that I cannot escape. My novels are variants of an architecture based on the number seven." The tone of this passage carries through The Art of the Novel, which is more a series of divagations than of systematic reflections. While Kundera's little book is worthy of being considered in the company of Henry James's prefaces, E.M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel, and Alain Robbe-Grillet's Pour un nouveau roman, it is quite different from any of them. The book resists paraphrase. The pensees found here yield the best results when read in small doses. Many of Kundera's statements have the finality of aphorisms: "A novel examines not reality but existence." "And all of History is merely the story of a few characters (a Faust, a Don Juan, a Don Quixote, a Rastignac, an Esch) who have traversed Europe's centuries together." "The more attentively we read a novel, the more impossible the answer, because the novel is, by definition, the ironic art: its 'truth' is concealed, undeclared, undeclarable." "Every true novelist listens for that suprapersonal wisdom, which explains why great novels are always a little more intelligent than their authors." Kundera sees the novel as being at the nerve center of every experience of the modern. For him, Cervantes is as much the discoverer of the modern age as Descartes. "Flaubert's discovery [of stupidity] is more important for the future of the world than the most startling ideas of Marx or Freud." "The pleiad of great Central European novelists: Kafka, Hasek, Musil, Broch, Gombrowicz" act as twentieth-century barometers of antilyrical, anti-romantic malaise. Add to the list Rabelais, Sterne, and Diderot as representatives of playfulness and lightness, and we have Kundera's own version of the history of the European novel. The Art of the Novel contains two "dialogues" which reveal the novelist's own poetics. Music is essential to the composition of his novels: "Each of the parts in my novels could carry a musical indication: moderato, presto, adagio, and so on." He uses "polyphonic confrontation" ju'st as Hermann Broch and others of his favorite novelists did. MJF Newsom, Robert. A LIKELY STORY: PROBABILITY AND PLAY IN FICTION.

READING PEOPLE, READING PLOTS: CHARACTER, PROGRESSION, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF NARRATIVE. University of Chicago Press, 1989. 238 pp. $34.95 cloth, $13.50 paper. Although many volumes of narrative theory have been published in recent years, few make any real effort to come to terms with the nature of characterization. Thus, this work fills a genuine need. Building on the theories of Ralph Rader and Peter Rabinowitz, Phelan defines three distinct components of character (synthetic, mimetic, and thematic) which he then employs in readings that foreground "the text as a communication between author and reader." Furthermore, since character cannot be separated from its development within plot, Phelan's analyses proceed in a sequential, reader-oriented manner. These concepts are put to the test in a reading of George Orwell's 1984 which skillfully reveals the way in which the protagonist transforms, solidifies, and assumes significance as the reader presses through the text. Phelan also offers an analysis of a work which is in many ways obsessed with characterization, John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman. Finally, this method is brought to bear on Italo Calvino's If on a winter's night a traveller, a work that is particularly problematic in that the synthetic component of character is so dominant. For those with little taste for methodological rigor, Phelan's work may seem tediously rule-governed. Nonetheless, his approach to characterization is original, sophisticated, and of obvious critical and pedagogical value. Michael Carroll, University of New Orleans Richards Jeffrey.

Schnitzer's volume, a serious contribution to the literature on modern fiction and the visual arts, is divided into three long chapters: the first is on "ocular realism" (the natural vision of the "innocent eye") and encompasses the impressionism of Stephen Crane, Virginia Woolf and the contemporary Peter Matthiessen; the second is on "conceptual realism" and encompasses the Cezanne-inspired Postimpressionism of Hemingway, Lawrence, and-from yet another perspective-Woolf again; the third is on Cubism and the analogous literary effects of Joyce and Stein. In each case, Schnitzer carefully discusses the art historical understanding of the movement in question and then examines the degree to which one can claim legitimate influences on literature or "equivalent" effects. Schnitzer eschews sweeping generalizations and finds in her analyses that any given author may relate to different visual equivalents. This is both a historical and theoretical study, leaning heavily on a voluminous secondary literature and arguing explicitly for an inter-art scholarship that is precise and specific in its formulations. MDO Stonehill, Brian. THE SELF-CONSCIOUS NOVEL: ARTIFICE IN FICTION FROM JOYCE TO PYNCHON. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988. 221 pp. $26.95. This admirable study is filled with concepts and readings with which I disagree. But Stonehill's sensibility is so fine and his judgment so secure that he invariably sees the potential problems in his own formulations. Thus, for example, Finnegans Wake is "one of the most glorious dead ends in literature," but if "we are still learning to be Joyce's contemporaries . .. and if we have yet to learn to read Finnegans Wake, how can Joyce's endeavor be called a dead end?" On larger issues, he exaggerates, I believe, the inevitable conflict between mimetic and self-conscious fictions, but concludes that "As a concept and as a genre . . . the self- 287</page><page sequence="102">G-7 CRITICISM OF FICTION conscious novel makes salient fiction's dual nature-its ludic and its mimetic mission." I disagree similarly with his inclusion of auto-biographical elements-as in the novels of Nabokov-in the genre of self-consciousness, but he is the first to note that, in fact, "Nabokov specializes in signatures, not self-portraits." This is not cowardly ambivalence but the working of a critical mind that perceives contradictions and is able to live with them: a very good Modernist critical mind, as I view it. Stonehill's definition of self-conscious fiction is quite broad; his "Repertoire of Reflexivity" lists thirty-six characteristics, varying from author to author. His purview includes Gaddis, Pynchon, and Barth, in addition to Joyce and Nabokov, with brief references to John Irving, Jeremy Leven, Philip Roth, Raymond Carver, and Primo Levi. It is easy to say that this is not perhaps the book that I would myself wish to write, but it is a work well worth our study, surely the best that we have yet had on the topic. MPL Suvin, Darko. POSITIONS AND PRESUPPOSITIONS IN SCIENCE FICTION. Kent State University Press, 1988. 228 pp. $26. Thickstun, William R. VISIONARY CLOSURE IN THE MODERN NOVEL. St. Martin's, 1988. 208 pp. $35. William Thickstun believes that the endings of Howards End, The Rainbow, Ulysses, To the Lighthouse, and The Sound and the Fury represent "a new form of closure in the novel," one that draws on two literary traditions-the "culminating revelation" and the "embodied Muse" of religious and Romantic poetry. "In the final section of each of these novels, a woman has a visionary experience that transcends full expression in language and that seems to make possible a concluding affirmation or image of order." Such endings "combine unconstricted vitality of character with the aesthetic demands of closure." Thickstun relates his study of closure in (selected) modern fiction to such predecessors as Alan Friedman's The Turn of The Novel (1966) and Frank Kermode's The Sense of an Ending(1967) and also acknowledges an intellectual debt to M.H. Abrams's The Mirror and the Lamp (1953) and Natural Supernaturalism (1971). A self-proclaimed formalist (Erich Auerbach's "methodological deference to the properties of the literary works themselves . . . still seems to me the most sensitive and profitable way to approach the complex texts of modernism"), Thickstun has no interest in Roland Barthes, Jonathan Culler, Gerard Genette, Geoffrey Hartmann, and D.A. Miller (all of whom he mentions) nor in feminist criticism (to which he never refers). While it may be true, as Thickstun avers, that structuralism is of no use to a critic interested in the Modernists' concern with character, any 288</page><page sequence="103">discussion of Margaret Schlegel, Ursula Brangwen, Molly Bloom, Lily Briscoe, Caddy Compson and Dilsey as "embodied Muses" that does not avail itself of feminist revisions of the Muse tradition provided by Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Susan Stanford Friedman, and Joanne Feit Diehl (among many others) is severely handicapped.

Daniel Albright has collected here essays and reviews, largely from The New York Review of Books, written during the 1970s and early 1980s. These pieces discuss sensitively how American poets working in one of the three traditions identified by Ehrenpreis-conventionally didactic (Frost), Symbolist Modernist (Eliot), native American sublime (Whitman)-struggle to relate character to style, personal experience to poetic form. Ehrenpreis thinks of this relation in terms of the venerable form/content opposition. Poets, like all of us only more so, live lives of not-so-quiet randomness approaching the blaring chaos. Poetry, for them as for us, contains, transforms, and so quiets the always incipient chaos by means of the fluent order of aesthetic forms. The interest of this situation 290</page><page sequence="105">lies for them not in the detailed analysis of the final product, nor in the shambling minutiae of everyday life, but rather in the strenuous process of transfiguration, the fragile moment of artistic transmutation. This orientation results in the spectacle of a most sympathetic, scholarly appreciation of major American poets, including (among others) Whitman, Dickinson, Stevens, Berryman, and Lowell. The three T.S. Eliot treatments are the best, while the least sympathetic treatment comes down so hard on Pound for his anti-Semitism that Ehrenpreis fails to see what poetic achievement does lie before him. The editor provides a useful introduction, giving a brief account of the late scholar's life and final views of poetry. These fine critical appreciations display an original American, scholarly intelligence, one that never stopped extending itself into unfamiliar regions in a style whose character will remain for some time without peer.

University of Illinois Press, 1988. 243 pp. $21. 95. This is an extraordinarily useful anthology, profitable for all teachers of contemporary poetry and poetics, and for those interested in the innovative Modernisms. Essentially, all the essays raise the question of the ideological functions of formal strategies (free verse prosodies, line break, page space, typographical experiment) for the expression of particular, interested, and historically situated poets. In short, the key essays in the book focus on the ideologies of form and the historical dimensions of formal issues. This rupture with an aestheicized or "technical" approach to poetry is accomplished in lucid, textually subtle analyses, allowing the reader the best of two critical worlds: an interest in discursive strategies and contextualization, along with a refinement of attention to the texture of a text. Certain essays are outstanding. James Scully's "Line Break" is a scintillating theoretical and practical discussion of poetry as a social practice, of poems as "practices" "formed in and through" "historically specific worlds," seeing technique as a "historically specific relation to a constituency." Kathleen Fraser's reading of experimental women poets (S. Howe, B. Guest, B. Dahlen, among others) is an effervescent account of the ways in which textual practices such as interruption, palimpsest, split page, condensation, page as canvas, and line break resonate with the imperatives and situations of women in personal and historical senses. Stephen E. Henderson traces the alliances between poetry and music and the oral tradition for African-Americans: call and response, riffing, counter rhythms, stereophonic effects, polyvocality, and "worrying the line" all have their textual expression in the work of contemporary black writers. This anthology constructs itself as an answer to the organicist (breath-based, speech-based) proposals explaining free verse prosodies. 291</page><page sequence="106">G-8 CRITICISM OF POETRY This kind of critique might explain why Language Poetries (which have criticized this organicist model most explicitly) are given a mini-anthology at the end of the book. This strategy does add certain cross-lights to the academic discussion, but it also valorizes that approach within contemporary poetics by allowing it to speak in propria personae. Others of the approaches discussed here (Asian-American poetries, African- American poetries, feminist poetries, inter alia) might have had equal claims on anthology space. RBD Gelpi, Albert. A COHERENT SPLENDOR: THE AMERICAN POETIC RENAISSANCE, 1910-1950. Cambridge, 1987. No price listed. This study maps the field of Modernist American poetry according to a splitting of Romanticism into the categories of symbolism and imagism, with Stevens pursuing a symbolist aesthetic of "pure poetry" and Eliot deriving from the Symbolists a method of breaking from the late Romantic manner, while Pound, Williams, and H.D. were inspired by an imagistic impulse. Stevens (quite reductively) comes out an escapist, and Eliot, with his desire for "classical" norms, exhibits "the backward-looking, often reactionary aspect of Modernism." Pound, Williams, and H.D. as empirical writers fare better. Although the author wishes to integrate this historical argument with the interpretive emphasis in the study so that the explications will not be mere appendages to the discourse, the two aims are often disjunctive, with explications and passages of paraphrasing that seem far removed from the argument. Long summaries of H.D.'s novels are a case in point. The argument becomes diffuse, even though passages-the discussion of Pound and Fenellosa, say-shine out like gems in the conglomerate. At times, as in the analysis of Frost's "Design," one encounters what seems to be set pieces from an undergraduate course; much, however, seems aimed at a far more sophisticated audience. With effort, a student new to modern American poetry could obtain a good introduction to it. For the reader with greater sophistication, the rewards are intermittent but real. The concluding "Coda" on Yvor Winters and Robinson Jeffers, for example, is trenchant and enlightening. RBD Harris, Marie and Kathleen Aguero, eds.

POETS ON PAINTERS: ESSAYS ON THE ART OF PAINTING BY TWENTIETH-CENTURY POETS. University of California Press, 1988. 362 pp. No price listed. This is an attractive book which has the virtue of collecting an eclectic array of modern and contemporary British and American authors caught writing about art. And the essays can range from the abstract (by Stevens and Yeats), to the autobiographical (Lawrence and Tomlinson, discussing their careers as visual artists), to the concrete visual reading offered by Bishop on Valdes, Rexroth on L6ger, and Duncan on Jess. Perhaps the most fascinating is Hollander's brilliantly informed reading of an allegorical series by the nineteenth-century American painter Thomas Cole. One of the virtues of the collection is the editor's design to select essays that are pointedly illuminating about the poets' world views, ethics, poetics, or theories-such as O'Hara on Pollock, Davenport on Balthus, Williams on untutored or "primitive" painters, and Stein on visual representation. McClatchy constructs succinct and informative headnotes discussing both poet and painter. The virtues of a pleasant book are shadowed by a vice which would be just plain silly if the editor did not clearly take this point so seriously. McClatchy thinks that the distinction of his collection is that "the essays in this book . . . are rarely theoretical." Theory in the editor's unexamined binary is apparently the enemy of "a fresh eye and a freshened language" which poets-as mortals peculiarly gifted in style-bring to art writing. So for the editor, this collection has its greatest force when he reduces poets to witty phrasemakers and finds them turning decorative and apt mots about artworks. This is wholly inadequate understanding of what is going on in any essay and demeans the writers and the artists notably. And it is a self-contradictory position. McClatchy is immediately found praising certain poets for treating context, or iconography, or for finding paintings as "objectified correlatives" of painters' stances in the world. It is interesting to speculate whether McClatchy thinks that any of these concepts of analytic categories were brought to us by (atheoretical) storks or found under (atheoretical) cabbage leaves. His witty phrasemaker's modulation on a concept of T.S. Eliot makes especially jejune his attempt to spear "theory" with the notion that it brings nothing to the processes of seeing, interpreting, and thinking about art. RBD Raffel, Burton.

Introduction, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Cornell University Press, 1988. 142 pp. $6.95 paper. A reprinting of a classic definitional essay 1939 in the building of African- American literary criticism of Black American poets, with a succinct analytic introduction by Gates, placing author Redding contextually in the history of ideas about race, racism, and African-American strategies of response. Redding's achievement lay in (1) the identification of pivotal works in a Black tradition, grouping authors in four historically-motivated stages; (2) his identification of patterns of influence, intertextuality, and revisionary rewritings among African-American authors. Further, he argues (3) that the written tradition is interactively indebted to Black vernacular forms and voices (a radical populist position quite brave in an embourgeoisified context), and he proposes (4) that Black literature has a vindicatory function in embodying aesthetic and intellectual agency, a function that is empowering for Blacks and might tacitly answer certain disparagements of African-American achievement. For Modernists, the crucial chapter concerns the "Emergence of the New Negro," covering 1915-1935 and treating poets Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, and James Weldon Johnson, among others.

Through readings which are richly informed by biographical details, she explores many of the cornerstones of modern poetry- hermetic "dark texts," whose authors, following Rimbaud in his "Season in Hell," simultaneously probe both language and the psyche. 294</page><page sequence="109">Wight begins with T. S. Eliot; but, in his poetry, she finds only Dante's chaste virgins and the Stabat Mater icons of medieval art. Nor can she find any seer-poets among Max Jacob's ambiguous representations of women. More surprisingly, however, she discovers no figure of Promethean Woman in Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons. Instead, she unveils encoded references to Alice B. Toklas, often hidden in allusions to food and food- bearers. As for Vallejo-torn between two cultures-and suffering for it in a squalid Peruvian jail, his Tri/ce-as Wight argues-consigns women to traditional roles as mothers or lovers. Even Antonin Artaud, disgusted with European culture, depicts women either as the "carnal matter of creation" or as models of the virgin Heloise, to whom Artaud will play Abelard and inevitably undergo castration. Finally, Wight's exploration leads her to conclude that there is no evidence of Promethean Woman's appearance in this poetry. All the women depicted enact the traditional roles: lovers, temptresses, mothers, and nurturers. Maybe Rimbaud's picture of the woman of vision is just another Romantic illusion, another product of the nineteenth century's fantasy of progress. PAM C Altman, Meryl Beth.

This book includes seventeen of the eighteen papers delivered at the recent International Symposium on Federico Garcfa Lorca held at UCLA to mark the fiftieth anniversary of his assassination. The essays are organized by chronology and genre, the first three (on his childhood, early poems, and early aesthetic) providing easy access for the non-specialist, while the final five on his theatre (three written in Spanish) are linked to the essays on his poetry by Virginia Higginbotham's brief but comprehensive survey of the music which pervades both parts of Lorca's canon. Beyond the unattractive appearance of photocopied pages and some rather pedestrian writing and predictable treatments, there are several valuable studies: Reed Anderson provocatively explores "the liminal space" and "time that is uniquely that of transitions or passages" in several of the plays, while Nigel Dennis offers a graceful examination of Lorca's "strategies of self perception"-notably the image of "the shattered mirror," equated with the "irredeemable loss of the edenic wholeness," a perception which pervades Lorca's career. The best piece, "Agua que no desemboca," by the collection's editor, C. Brian Morris, uses the image of "still water" (from "Nina ahogada en el pozo" of Poeta en Nuevo York) as a starting point to 296</page><page sequence="111">trace, with wit, intelligence, and sensitivity, the diverse manifestations of water in Lorca's poetry. Morris aptly praises "the conscious recall and recasting of an image, a means of seeking the past while showing how irretrievable it is ... ." Three essays on Romancero Gitano and two on Seis Poemas Galegos help to create a balance between early and late work, but weak pieces on Poeta and the posthumously published play, El Publico, among the least understood of Lorca's works, create gaps in vital areas of Lorca criticism and scholarship. Since Lorca's reading audience is not limited to Spanish specialists, the collection would benefit from translations of the quotations; Notes on Contributors would also be helpful. ASL Myrsiades, Kostas, and Linda S. Myrsiades. THE KARAGIOZIS HEROIC PERFORMANCE IN GREEK SHADOW THEATER. University Press of New England, 1988. 248 pp. $30. The shadow puppet theatre called Karagiozis, write the authors, "has been seen . . . as the most representative national Greek dramatic art since old comedy and Aristophanes." It is a popular form in a land whose art, into this century, has to a large extent been popular, and so it has much to tell us about Greek culture as a whole. This is the most complete study of the form-and it makes available as well the newly translated texts of "the two most important heroic performances of the . . . tradition," Kostas Manos's Katsandonis and Markos Ksanthos's Alexander. For scholars of Modern Greek Studies, as for those interested in Greek culture generally, this is a fascinating work. MPL Norrish, Peter. THE TRAGEDY AND COMEDY IN FRANCE, 1945-70.

Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press, 1988. 252 pp. $9.95. In a careful analysis of the work of America's five most prominent black playwrights-Willis Richardson, Randolph Edmonds, Langston Hughes, LeRoi Jones, and Ed Bullins-Sanders's new book imparts several visions of the black experience in America. She scrutinizes the unique cultural posture that is achieved by the black playwright's adoption of an alien European theatrical tradition in the effort to express the distinctiveness of the American black experience to audiences nurtured in the conventions of European culture. Sanders observes that one unifying feature of the black stage in America is the effort-shared by all black playwrights-to embody and; articulate a universe in which black Americans meaningfully strive to attain recognition as authentic Americans. The dramatists have attempted to 297</page><page sequence="112">G-9 CRITICISM OF DRAMA portray black citizens with as much of a stake in the republic as the members of the so-called dominant culture. Perhaps the most significant research in Sanders's book is her study of the means by which black playwrights have accommodated themselves to the Euro-American theatrical tradition without assimilating it. While black playwrights have borrowed from traditions not their own, Sanders notes that these traditions have not been uncritically absorbed, but rather transfigured and made new. For example, unlike many conventional black (or, for that matter, female) characters in American drama, the black character of this new theatrical construct does not derive identity from some "other," but rather, affirms his or her autonomy and independence; he or she "preclude[s] condescension" and thereby compels the audience to affirm that autonomy too. In such a respect, Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun and James Baldwin's Blues for Mr. Charlie establish the foundation for such fully mature black theatre as Ntozake Shange's for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf. Thoughtfully written and impressively documented, this book should be the new standard work for all students and instructors of contemporary literature and theatre.

Studies in Cinema, No. 41. UMI Research Press, 1988. 154 pp. $18.95. Geist's study provides a competent, careful, and briefly documented overview of Wenders's career to date. Brief in analysis and description, her account touches upon prominent trends and techniques in Wenders's works. The weakness of her filmography cum biography is that she does not enter into the deeper (and more troubling) aspects of his films, allowing correlative description to stand in place of analysis in most instances. As a result, her study is a fertile source-book of untapped critical possibilities, particularly those relating to Wenders' love-hate relationship with America, women, and, above all, men. Geist's book opens with a short biography of the German film-maker, which is followed by a chronicle summary of works beginning with his first group of German Films (1967-1977) and concluding with those American films made between 1978 and 1985. In her survey, Geist argues-persuasively, I think-that Wenders's films are intratextual, later films graphically referring to earlier endeavors, uniformly inspired and fueled by literary sources (The Scarlet Letter, Handke, Shepard, Goethe), self-involved in rock-and-roll mentalities as sources of emotional motivation, and that they document significant themes, trends, and techniques in the New German Cinema movement. Overall, Geist sees Wenders's films as quests in search of the redemption of a complete self- expression, that "Slow Homecoming" about which Handke so eloquently wrote and to which Wenders might just finally be arriving with The Sky Over Berlin (1987). Kevin Z. Moore Gledhill, Christine, ed. HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS: STUDIES IN MELODRAMA AND THE WOMAN'S FILM. British Film Institute and the University of Illinois Press, 1988. 365 pp. + illus. $32.50 cloth, $17.95 paper. This is an indispensable anthology, from Gledhill's cogent Introduction through her superb selection of eighteen essays-some already classics-and some fine new ones. Since its nineteenth-century beginnings in popular theater, melodrama has provided a pleasurable means of addressing covertly the ideological, social, and economic conflicts that have evolved with the Industrial Revolution. The opening essays suggest that what has made melodrama not only a popular genre but also a prominent one for cultural and feminist exploration since the 1970s is its use of non-verbal, theatrical, and cinematic sign systems to carry messages which expand, frequently conflict with, and undercut the verbal content. The next section explores the disparity between the role of women in society and the representation of "woman" by the film industry between the 1930s and the 1960s; these essays open up the social, ideological, and 300</page><page sequence="115">cultural-not to mention consumerist-discourses at work in maternal and historical film melodrama. The third section focuses on the new Freudian awareness in the same period; films in which women's desires, fears, fantasies, ideologies, and aesthetic pleasures conflict with the needs of the melodramatic hero in Hollywood's family romances are often resolved by some pseudo-psychoanalytical means which often reinforces conventional social restraints on women. The final four essays counterbalance conventional psychoanalytic textual analysis, which foregrounds the masculine spectator's voyeurist and fetishist pleasures, by exploring the variety of spectatorial positions that women take in order to derive pleasure from the genre. The whole book invites the viewing of film melodrama as a rich cultural artifact of our time. HTB Higginbotham, Virginia. SPANISH FILM UNDER FRANCO. University of Texas Press, 1988. 160 pp. + illus. $20. Higginbotham provides a historical perspective in her critical analysis and in political and social interpretation of the major works of Spanish cinema. She proceeds chronologically, beginning with an overview of prewar film (Velo, Alcoriza, and Buniuel) and the effects of censorship during the dictatorship (1939-1975): on the one hand an official political cinema, and on the other the "estetica franquista," a highly metaphorical film whose convoluted syntax was not decipherable to the censors (Bardem, Berlanga). She then describes the short "apertura" of 1960, the time of Franco's effort to appear democratic, which led to "l'affaire Viridiana" when Bufiuel was invited back to Spain to make a film and influenced the young directors such as Saura-the time of the "New Spanish Cinema." The critic explains how the opening closed in 1969, when most directors abandoned filmmaking, except the few who remained dedicated to resisting Franco's social and political myths (Picazo, Erice, Saura). The final focus falls on the transition after Franco's death, characterized by an initial burst of political satire (Herralde, Patino, Chavarri) and a more relaxed "estetica franquista."

INVISIBLE STORYTELLERS: VOICE-OVER NARRATION IN AMERICAN FICTION FILM. University of California Press, 1988. 167 pp. + illus. $24.95. As Kozloff reminds us, it is common to discuss the degree to which twentieth-century writers have been affected by photography and cinematography; but there are far fewer discussions of the impact of Modernism on the development of film technique. Voice-over narration is, according to Kozloff, a hybrid that "draws on two contradictory impulses-hearkening back to simple oral storytelling and a modernist (if not 'postmodernist' self-consciousness regarding narrative discourse." Qualities that films with voice-over narration share with Modernist fiction include fascination with chronology and narrative voice, a distinction between the narrator in and of the tale and some larger authorial presence, awareness of the subjectivity of perception, and cultivation of irony. Kozloff's analysis of such Hollywood classics as How Green Was My Valley, Letter from An Unknown Woman, and All About Eve borrows freely from such literary narrative theorists as Genette, Scholes and Kellogg, Chatman, Barthes, and Booth. This makes her book accessible to the literary scholar and critic at the same time that it furthers her project of exploring both the similarities and the dissimilarities between written and cinematic narratives. Kozloff's chapter on irony does a particularly good job of comparing the two; as she points out, while literature is linear and sequential, film can present narration and image simultaneously; and while both the story and discourse of literature are transmitted through a single sign system (language), film employs multiple sign systems (language, image, music). As her discussion of Barry Lyndon makes clear, "the relationships between the verbal narration and the images/action portrayed on the screen are extraordinarily complex." ECR Kuhn, Annette. CINEMA, CENSORSHIP AND SEXUALITY, 1909-1925. Cinema and Society Series. Routledge, 1988. 260 pp. + illus. $57.50. Kuhn uses as case histories several British and American films (on the topics of abortion, venereal disease, and birth control) which were exhibited during the first sixteen years of cinema's rapid development in Britain. She finds-invoking Foucault-that the sexual "within and beyond these films" is organized and constructed as an object of censorship by "the institutions, institutional practices, powers and knowledges" of our culture. Not surprisingly, the film industry, whose principal institutional practice is maximizing film audiences by whatever means necessary, cooperates, however reluctantly,in the regulatory process. Kuhn also finds that, within this system of regulation, censorship creates censorable films, which because of the lure of the forbidden become a marketable property. Thus, 302</page><page sequence="117">while censorship prohibits, it also produces films. Film censorship, then, is a "process embodying complex and potentially contradictory relations of power," from which emerges "a public sphere of cinema constituted by particular objects of regulation: modes of consumption of films, consumers of films, categories of films, and last-and quite possibly least-contents of films." In uncovering the complex interrelationships of cultural practices, powers and discourses, Kuhn's analysis of the censorship apparatus is valuable to American as well as British readers. HTB Mayne, Judith. PRIVATE NOVELS, PUBLIC FILMS. University of Georgia Press, 1988. 184 pp. $22. For some time, Mayne has been one of the most perceptive contemporary commentators on film and film theory. While this study returns to many of the issues which have concerned her in the past (about representations of gender or the various cinematic engagements of spectator and screen), it contains one of her most sustained and cogent arguments. The subject matter, novels and films, seems peculiarly old fashioned, but the measure of the book's success is how fresh those issues appear within Mayne's framework. The central theoretical concern is the continual tension and negotiation of the relationship between public and private life, and of the ways in which that distinction evolves as a thematic issue, which in turn reflects broader social issues about artistic production and reception. Finding this issue in fiction since the eighteenth century and still very much alive in films of the twentieth century, Mayne moves sweepingly from Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Richardson's Clarissa through examples of the nineteenth-century novel (Austen and Balzac) to pre-classical silent movies. She concludes, finally, with its evolution in the so-called "classical cinema" of Citizen Kane and Mildred Pierce. Alternately addressing central theoretical debates (about film "reading," for instance) and analyzing novels and films in careful detail, Mayne re-examines the texts and the relationship between film and literature in general. She views the two fields not as separate and vaguely related fields or as particular textual achievements, but as mutual cultural and ideological productions aimed at positioning viewers and readers within certain middle-class social and psychological parameters. In this context, those old questions about film and literature seem far more spirited and complicated than ever before. TC Modleski, Tania. THE WOMEN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH: HITCHCOCK AND FEMINIST THEORY. London: Methuen, 1988. 149 pp. + illus. $25. cloth, $10.95 paper. Modleski analyzes a selection of Hitchcock's films (Blackmail, Murder, Rebecca, Notorious, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Frenzy) from a sustained Deconstructionist perspective. She uses Freudian and neo-Freudian psychoanalytical explanations to illuminate the director's complex, ambivalent positions and assumptions regarding women (both as characters 303</page><page sequence="118">G-10 CRITICISM OF FILM AND/AS LITERATURE and spectators), and men as well. Hers is an "irreverent" feminist perspective, revisionist of the concepts of misogyny and matrophobia which she sees in those films. She focuses on Hitchcock's awareness and manipulation of the problematics of identity and identification in both men and women. She argues that these account for the ambivalence between hatred and understanding of women in the films, and for their ambiguous sexuality, which threatens to destabilize gender identity for protagonists and viewers alike. HRM Naremore, James. ACTING IN THE CINEMA. University of California Press, 1988. vii + 307 pp. Illus. $24.95. The theatricality of acting in cinema-whose theorists since its beginnings have generally assumed that its status increases as it proves its difference from theater-is Naremore's engaging focus in this book, and his wide- ranging synthesis of recent semiotic, psychoanalytic, literary, and film theory toward this end make it an invaluable contribution to the study of film. He begins by defining, with illuminating examples from dozens of films and from nineteenth-century theatrical conventions, five performance codes (boundary or framing, rhetorical, expressive, harmonic, anthropomorphic). These he uses informally in the second part to analyze with admirable succinctness the star performances in seven films: Gish in True Heart Susie (1919), Chaplin in The Cold Rush (1925), Dietrich in Morocco (1930), Cagney in Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), Hepburn in Holiday(1938), Brando in On the Waterfront(1954), and Grant in North by Northwest (1959). He concludes with a perceptive examination of the theatricality of two ensemble performance texts: Rear Window(1954) and The King of Comedy (1983). Throughout he shows that, contrary to much previous thought on film acting, Hollywood has appropriated stage acting's variety of stylized codes for natural behavior. With his final discussion of these two films, Naremore clinches another point developed from the start: the very theatricality of many films encourages audiences to recognize not only the theatricality of society itself, but also, in Erving Goffman's terms, our own presentations of self in everyday life as we exercise "the power of conducting meaning."

THE ACOUSTIC MIRROR: THE FEMALE VOICE IN PSYCHOANALYSIS AND CINEMA. Theories of Representation and Difference. Indiana University Press, 1988. 257 pp. 37.50 cloth, $12.50 paper. Following several feminist studies which entered on the visual image of woman in film, Silverman's "acoustic mirror" captures the voice that accompanies the image of woman as she is reflected in psychoanalytic theory and projected in current independent as well as classical Hollywood studio films (which have developed parallel to the popularization of Freudian analysis). What is special about this book is not simply its successful focus on the acoustic side of the image-centered film industry's construction of woman. Nor is it special simply because Silverman confirms with a broad range of illuminating filmic examples her perception that psychoanalytic theory has become the principal, if not the only cultural source, for validating our postulate that the power and authority of discourse have been withheld from women. What makes the ultimate difference in the pivotal work are her tactful and thoughtful interrogations of specific psychoanalytic theorists' positions (chiefly Freud, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Michel Chion, Guy Risolato) and her challenging of the assumption that current psychoanalytic and feminist theories are adequate to the task of eliciting the full range of the female voice and psyche. Throughout the book she argues convincingly that the pervasive sense of separation, lack or division of one active subject from another cannot be explained solely by genital-centered theories of difference. Such provocative challenges have opened new directions for both feminist and psychoanalytic theory, which Silverman, among others, is now pursuing. HTB Taylor, Richard, ed. S. M. EISENSTEIN: SELECTED WORKS, VOLUME I: WRITINGS, 1922-1934. Indiana University Press, 1988. 334 pp. No price listed. Eisenstein has long been recognized as not only one of the most influential and brilliant filmmakers of this century, but also as one of its most profound film theorists. Much of what we have known about his thinking has been confined to a few texts such as Film Form and Film Sense. This volume, however, is the first of a three-volume edition that will gather together a large body of writing which, despite Jay Leyda's earlier efforts, has been largely unknown to English-speaking film scholars. Across a fascinating and demanding array of film essays, newspaper accounts, and literary fragments, there develops a far more mobile image of a filmmaker who could both argue a complex theory of montage and enjoy meeting Rin-Tin- Tin in Hollywood. This first of three volumes is, in Richard Taylor's 305</page><page sequence="120">G-10 CRITICISM OF FILM AND/AS LITERATURE accurate assessment, absolutely "comprehensive and scholarly"; it has been long overdo. TC Todd, Janet, ed. WOMEN AND FILM. Women &amp; Literature Series, Vol. 4. Holmes and Meier Publishers, 1988. 281 pp. + illus. $44.50. Most of the authors writing for this excellent collection confirm the destructive gender conditioning imposed on us by Hollywood's eighty- year-old reliance on both the illusionary realist mode and its entrenched filmmaking apparatus (continuity-cutting, linear narrative, conventionally- coded lighting, camera work, music, and the like). Essays by Judith Mayne on the women's films of World War II, Debra Fried on Cukor's The Women (1939), Richard Dyer on Marilyn Monroe's films and photos, Lucy Fischer on Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950), and Anca Vlasopolos on Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) effectively expose Hollywood's anti-feminist conventions. More optimistically, Robert Kolker uses films by Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick to demonstrate how alterations of the conventional cinematic apparatus within the realist mode can render less stereotyped male and female characters and, ultimately, alter social attitudes. The more radical the change in form, he notes, the more radical will be the change in content. The problematics of radical change, however, become apparent in the essays which investigate the work of feminist actresses and directors, from Dietrich in The Scarlet Empress (1934), through Jane Fonda's films to Marguerite Duras's films and Margarethe von Trotta's Marianne and Juliane (1981). While an authentic feminist content can be achieved to some degree of transparency in the conventional realist mode, the most radical experiments with a newly- coined cinematic apparatus are inaccessible to Hollywood-trained spectators, male or female. Nevertheless, increasing directorial skill in developing new modes, plus audience education through well-written books such as this one, can make a cultural and artistic difference over time. HTB Tuska, Jon. IN MANORS AND ALLEYS: A CASEBOOK ON THE AMERICAN DETECTIVE FILM. Greenwood Press, 1988. Contributions to the Study of Popular Culture, No. 17. 512 pp. $49.95. Television film writer and producer Jon Tuska has produced a significant historical account of the major writers in the detective fiction genre and of the films made from their novels. Moving from Edgar Allan Poe-the birth of the detective story-and the inevitable impact of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, he turns to the major writers of the period between the two World Wars, and then considers the technically more sophisticated films of their works which appeared in the 1970s and 1980s. He stresses 306</page><page sequence="121">that, just as detective novels have shifted from solving puzzling homicides to reflecting the higher level of violence in today's crime, films, too, have changed-from solving cerebral problems to reflecting the violence of the streets. Although avoiding a firm conclusion to his historical analysis, he identifies increased emphasis on psychological origins of fictional crime. Pointing out that both Jung and Freud were addicted to detective novels, particularly those of Georges Simenon, Agatha Christie, and Dorothy L. Sayers, he suggests that these seminal psychologists were trying to understand how violent homicide may be justice in itself. This analysis of the detective novel is thorough and well-related to the cinematic versions; Tuska has done a significant service in explicating psychological analyses of this genre in both book and film versions. Richard P. Moses Waller, Gregory A., ed. AMERICAN HORRORS: ESSAYS ON THE MODERN AMERICAN HORROR FILM. University of Illinois Press, 1988. 228 pp. $34.95 cloth, $14.50 paper. As a kind of Frankenstein's monster-dimwitted, but a genius of emotion-I have witnessed the development of the American horror film genre. Now, all of those nights at the drive-in have suddenly been given intellectual and social significance by this collection of essays. The ideas that had always hidden behind images of horrific transformation, cannibalism, and blood have been clearly and interestingly laid bare by the twelve pieces that make up Waller's book. Begi n ning with Rosemary's Baby and The Night of the Living Dead, both of which premiered in 1968, American Horrors traces the themes of the victimization of women, the psychological horror of the self, the relationship of the "other" to the community, and the forgotten value of the metaphysical. The critical methods utilized by the different authors vary, adding extra dimensions to the work as a whole. The book also contains both an excellent filmography and bibliography. American Horrors has the distinction of being as important a book for the fan as it is for the scholar. Jeffrey Ford C Ferraro, Carl David.
