<plain_text><page sequence="1">INT ROD UCT ION The Subject and its Scope Thè subject of this study is entitled " Rgvedic Legends Through the Ages." The purpose is to gather all the legends which are clearly referred to in the Rgveda and which have come down to us through subsequent Vedic and post- Vedic literature, including the Epics and the Purāņas, to record the transformation Which they have undergone from age to age and then to determine the rationale öf such transformation. Incidentally, the chronology of the several ancient texts apart from the very Age of the Rgveda comes into inquiry. The orignial home of the Rgvedic seers and the provenance of the sacred hymns require discussion. Whether there was an Indo-Iranian period at all in the great trek of the ancients, whether the Indian branch was quite independent of the Iranian, or whether the latter subsequently branched off from India Iran- wards - these are problems still awaiting solution. In the meantime, the great discovery of the prehistoric cultures of Harappa and Mohenjodaro and kindred types in Asia Minor has challenged all the more the tenacious efforts of Research to unravel ancient chronology. It has even baffled attempts to determine the relative sequence of the Rgvedic and the Indus-Valley civilizations. While the student owes a great debt to the researches of pioneers like Max Müller and Darmesteter, followed by a galaxy of accomplished scholars in India and outside and while, again, he is as much beholden to the finds of great explorers like Marshall, Majumdar and Aurel Stein, a more intensive study of protohistoric documents and a more extensive excavation of prehistoric sites,1 and, above all, a consistent and comprehensive appreciation of the results of the twofold inquiry (literary and archaeological), yet appear to be desirable pursuits. It was originally intended to study all if not most of the legends but the mate- rial collected grew into great proportion and the range of study extending from the Rgveda to the Purāņas through the intermediate stages represented by the later Samhitãs, the Brāhmaņas, the Epics etc., a study of all the legends proved impos- sible within the allotted time. Hence, three legends only were taken up for detailed investigation viz. (1) SARAMĀ (2) ŠUNAŠŠEPA2 and (a) VASISTHA AND VISVĀMITRA. II PÜRVASÜRAYAH The subject of Vedic Legends is vast, but comparatively few scholars have dealt with it3. The light of Vedic tradition was however kept burning in works 1. 44 Domain of prehistory ends with the appearance of written documents ; Indus Civilisa- tion belongs to proto-history (up to Alexander's invasion) " Rev.

Since the time of the " discovery of Sanskrit," however, pioneers5 in the West have among their writings recorded their impressions of Various legends. An elaborate historical study was made by J. Muir in his " Original Sanskrit Texts " (5 vols.). Latterly, Dr. Sieg wrote a monograph on " Die Sagenstoffe des Rgveda und die indische Itihāsatradition " setting forth general principles of investigation and dealing with four legends. 6 Jarl Charpentier wrote a dissertation on 44 Die Suparņasage "7 wherein he not only 4 analyses the several motifs of the Suparņa legend but also makes a learned contribution to the study of Indian legends in general.' Macdonell and Keith's 44 Vedic Index of Names and Subjects "8 is an invaluable contribution in the field, apart from being a Veritable source-book of Vedic lore in general. F. E. Pargiter has attempted to correlate the Purāņic legends with those of the Veda and brought out his 44 Ancient Indian Historical Tradition."9 Studies of single legends have been published from time to time by Bloomfield, Macdonell and others. In India too, considerable interest has been evinced by several scholars.10 Ill SOURCES OF STUDY An attempt is made to go into the original sources for a study of the legends. Mainly, the sources are : (a) The Samhitās and other Vedic texts including the Brāhmaņas (1500 B.C.- 600 B.C.)11 (b) Yâska's Nirukta12 (500 B.C.) (c) Šaunaka's Brhaddevatã13 (400 B.C.). 4. This is so far as the legends are concerned. Nirukta relates 36 stories, BD 40 and Ši?ya 23. The stories related by Sãyana are innumerable. 5. e.g. Roth (Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda) ; Max Müller (History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature), H. H. Wilson (Translation of RV in 6 vols.). Wilson has noted all the legends in his notes and sometimes given a historical estimate. 6. Viz. Die Šārngas, Šyāvāsva Âtreya, Vráa Jāna and Vãmadeva Gautama.

It may be remembered that the RgVeda-Samhitā does not narrate any legend ; but it is replete with allusions to numerous stories and episodes. These have been recounted and amplified in later Vedic and post-Vedic literature. We see the first attempts at narration in the Bhāhmaņas ;20 the Sunassepa legend, for instance, is fully narrated in the Aitareya which is said to be the oldest of its class. Its Rgvedic basis is a mere reference to Šunassepa's deliverance from the stakes. Vasistha and Visvāmitra both had enemies against whom they poured curses, but it is not known to the RV whether they hated each other. Similarly, the story of Sarama is hinted in outlines only in the Family-mandalas. The dialogue between her and the Panis in the tenth mandala (RV X 108)21 provides however an artistic setting for the story. During the post-Vedic period, tradition has been recorded in some cases, but briefly, by Yaska. Perhaps a younger contemporary of the authors of the Sūtras, his style has naturally been aphoristic. It could not be otherwise in the case of the Sarvānukramaņī (350 B.C.) also, which is in the nature of a comprehensive index to the Rgveda. It had had to comprise in the small compass of a sentence which should easily lend itself to be memorised, things like the prātīka, rsi, devatã, 14. Ed. with notes. A. A.

L. H ARI YAPP A chandas, and finally an episode or legend if any ; hence its brevity.22 The Brhaddevatā of Šaunaka (400 B.C.) happens to be a very useful source- book. It is mainly devoted to an enumeration of the deities of the RV in categori- cal order. But it comprises other matter also. The introduction which occupies the first chapter and three-quarters of the second, provides an interesting gramma- tical discussion closely related to the Nirukta and dealing with particles, propositions, nouns, pronouns, compounds and the analysis of words together with a criticism of Yâska's errors in dividing words. In the main body of the work is interspersed a considerable amount of other matter, notably about forty legends23 meant to explain the circumstances in which the hymns they were connected with, were composed. About 300 slokas, or approximately one-fourth of the whole work, are devoted to these legends. Narrated in epic style, they form the oldest systematic collection of legends which we possess in Sanskrit. Sâyana's commentary, Vedārthaprakāsa, is a mine of legendary information. Under the aegis of this versatile scholar,24 a band of profound scholars joined and wrote commentaries on all the sacred works, samhitās, brāhmaņas, Šrauta Sūtras etc. and also works of a secular nature.25 Just as the rise of Vijayanagara marked the revival of Hindu power, so also Sâyana's literary efforts marked the resuscitation of ancient Sanskrit Literature. Lastly, we have the Nïtimanjarï of Dya Dviveda (1494 A.D.). This work is a " collection of some 166 ethical maxims " illustrated as a rule by events and stories of the Vedic period. Relevant mantras and hymns from the RV are quoted and 22. Sadgurusisya (1187 A.D.), commentator of Sarvā. has related 23 legends in the course of his commentary known as Vedārthadīpikā (See p. 210 for a list). The name of this scholiast is impressive. According to Macdonell, his real name is not known, he was truly a disciple of six teachers whom he mentions at the end of com. (p. 168). They taught him seven books of knowledge : Vinâyakas Šūlapāņir Mukundah Sûryo Vyãsah Šivayogi ca sad vai / Namāmi tān sarvadā pantu mām te yair vai sadbhis sapta vidyäs tu dattāh // Ādyā Sarvānukramaņī dvitîyâ mahāvratam copanisaddvayam ca / Mahāvratam sūtram āsām trtīyā catvārimšadbrāhm- aņam (Aitareya Brāhmaņa) vai caturthī // Sūtram pañcamyatra sasthī tu grhyam Šakalyasya samhitā saptamlti / Imā dattā vidyäs tu sadbhir yair vai sadbhyo gurubhyo hi namo'stu tebh- ýah I/ One wonders whether these were real names - Vinayaka, Šūlapāņi, Mukunda, Sürya, Vyâsa and ŠivayogL This Pupil of Six Teachers lived in an age of intense literary activity (1187 A.D.) and himself rose to fame by his erudition and writings. It looks somewhat fictitious that not one of this group has otherwise been known in literary tradition. The names mentioned might represent presiding deities to whom the author was devoted. The first four had become the foremost gods in the religious conception and daily life by the 12th century. The fifth Vyâsa is the mythical compiler of all ancient books. The Sixth, perhaps, was a real person or the Spiri- tual Entity that he had conceived as a result of his profound learning. 23. Vide BD p. 132 for a list of them. Macdonell's edition of BD. is a model in the art and science of editing. Editing ancient Oriental texts is considered to be a highly complicated task. Distinguished scholars, specially in the West, have put forth their best efforts in the field for over a century and a half. The principles and methods evolved out of such a long period of practical work have been illuminatingly set forth in the 44 Introduction to Indian Textual Criticism " by Dr. S. M. Katre (DCPRI, Poona) 1941. 24. Cf. P. D. Gune, Sâyana s commentary - its composition. Asutosh Mookerjee öiiver Jubilee Volumes : Vol. Ill Orientaila Part 3 (1927), pp. 467-77. The idea is that the com. is not the work of one hand, but many co-operated to bring out the great work, under the general editorship of Sâyana. The present writer has adduced further proof in his article 44 The Rgvedic word Parvata " contributed to the Prof. M. Hiriyanna Commemoration Volume (in the Press), Mysore. [Since published]. 25. Works like Mâdhavïya-dhâtu-vrtti, Kâlamâdhavîya, Bindu-madnaviya etc.</page><page sequence="5">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 127 commented upon, largely borrowing from Sayana's commentary. Once Keith demurred26 at the idea of editing Nītimanjarī on the ground that there was little originality and less of contribution to knowledge in it. Though this is not wholly untrue, one feels that his decision against its publication was somewhat harsh. The importance of the work would have been evident if only its precursors like BD and Sarvā. had still to be unearthed. For the preservation of knowledge and continuity of tradition, it is indisputable that works, even of the nature of digest$ or compilations, need to be prepared and published from time to time. The one feature of the Nītimanjarī is that the illustrations are taken from the Veda only. For our purpose, we shall take account of it for additional corroboration of Vedic references. Macdonell and Keith's 44 Vedic Index of Names and Subjects " is an indispens- able guide to the student of Vedic antiquity. The authors' claim27 is quite justified that " it would include all information that can be extracted from Vedic literature on such topics as agriculture, astronomy, burial, caste, clothing, crime, diseases, economic conditions, food and drink, gambling, kingship, law and justice, marriage, morality, occupations, polyandry and polygamy, the position of women, usury, village communities, war, wedding ceremonies, widow-burning, witchcraft and many others. The proper names would embrace not only persons, tribes and peoples, but also mountains, rivers and countries. The geographical distribution of the Vedic population would thus also be presented." The special merit of the work is that the authors being themselves profound scholars of Sanskrit have not only culled out references from all available texts in an exhaustive manner, but also have recorded up-to-date results of comparative and critical investigations on various subjects and aspects bearing on the Veda. In estimating the value of the Epics and the Purāņas for a historical study,28 the view is generally held that sound conclusions are possible when only critical 26. Vide Keith : JRAS 1900, pp. 127-36. Keith has made a thorough examination of the work and one is obliged to, even after perusing the publication of it in Benares, agree entirely with his findings. Dya wrote the Nītimanjarī in 1444 A.D. Writing just a century after the Vedic revival in Vijayanagara under the leadership of Mādhava and Säyana, may it be that Dya was echoing the Säyana tradition ? It has been said above that the Sāyaņa-Mādhava output could not have been single-handed. A number of scholars should have worked under them as in an Academy. If Mukunda Dviveda, great-grandfather of Dya was a repository of Vedic lore, he might have well-nigh directly contributed to the great revival, at least as a junior contemporary of Säyana. Dviveda's abode was Ānanda, according to a verse in the work. If it is a place-name, it need not be in Gujarat only or in the heights of Kashmir. It may be somewhere in the south as well. There is an Ānandapuram in Mysore State near the Bombay border, not very far from old Vijayanagar (Hampi) ; and there are Väjasaneyins and Rk-šākhins in good number. The Uvata association was dismissed by Keith as untenable. The point is whether the family could be related to the Säyana School directly, in which case the portion of the Vedabhäsya contained in the Nīti may have been Dyä's family inheritance. But we must have further corroboration. 27. See p. vii VI Vol. I. It is a surprise, however, that the learned authors do not include Sarama in the Index. Macdonell has omitted to mention her name even in his HŠL. (1900). She should find a place at least as a " heavenly animal " or a mythical entity. Suparna has been included (vol. II p. 455) ! It seems to me to be an unaccountable omission. 28. For a thoroughly dependable account, reference may be made to Winternitz, HIL vol. I (1927) : section on Epics and Purāņas, pp. 311-606. The findings of pioneer scholars like Wilson and later of Holtzmann, Dahlmann, Jacobi, Hopkins and others have been well digested and, may we add, fair conclusions arrived at by Winternitz. His enthusiastic efforts before the International Congress of Orientalists to set afoot a critical edition of the Mahābhārata culminat- ed in the present BORI undertaking.</page><page sequence="6">128 H. L. HARIYAPPA editions of the texts are made available. No definite period of composition can be fixed for these works, because, through centuries they have been subjected to addi- tions and alterations with the result that they have grown in bulk. As it has proved in the case of the Mahābhārata, it is an arduous task to bring out critical editions. All the same the necessity for them is beyond question, if a systematic insight into the currents and cross currents of our culture is to be gained. At present, however, all observations based on the versions found in the Epics and the Purāņas will have to be made with due caution. The importance and popularity of these works, indeed, can, in no way, be lost sight of. They are the bed-rock of Hindu civilization. The Mahābhārata, specially, is not only an epic, not only a work of poetic art (kavya), but also, as Winternitz puts it, " a manual (Šāstra) of morality, law and philosophy, supported by the oldest tradition (smrti) and hence furnished with incontestible authority ; and since more than 1,500 years it has served the Indians as much for entertainment as for instruction and edification."29 The Rāmāyaņa was exposed in a far less degree to tampering by later hands. It could therefore, in spite of the first and seventh books, which are considered to be later additions, be still viewed as a compact work, when compared with the Mbh. Whereas the latter assumed grand proportions as it had to record the destinies of a whole race i.e. of the Kauravas bestirring the three worlds,30 the former described the life-story of one hero, Šrī Rāma, who has been described as an embodiment of human perfection. Rāmāyaņa, though less voluminous than the sister epic, is still a valuable book of human experience, less unwieldy but none-the-less full of aesthetic appeal. If we may so describe, Rāmāyaņa is for the Individual, Mahābhārata is for the Nation. More than before, the need is now great that the country should look back at these storehouses of culture and bring to bear a proper reorientation on the future outlook. 44 The Purāņas belong to the religious literature and are, for the later Indian religion which is generally called Hinduism and which culminates in the worship of Šiva and Visņu, approximately what the Veda is for the oldest religion or Brāhma- nism."31 They are closely connected with the epic compositions and further elaborate the legends contained therein to suit their own purpose. There has been no rule or restraint for such accretions, for even in later times, books are fabricated which assume the proud title "purāņa," or claim to be parts of ancient Purāņas. As Winternitz puts it, they are " new wine in old bottles." " The Purāņas are confessedly partly legendary and partly historical. The descriptions of superhuman beings and of other worlds than this, are glorified 29. HIL I, p. 321. 30. Cf.

They are the products of an imaginative and uncritical age in which men were not careful to distinguish fact from legend. It is the task of modern criticism to disentangle the two elements. Its first object should be to remove from the existing Purāņas all later additions, and then form a comparison of their oldest portions to determine the relations in which they stand to one another and thus, as far as possible, to restore their common tradition to its original form."32 IV LINES OF INVESTIGATION One need not aspire for any novel finds in the study of the legends. They are repeated again and again in successive generations ; perhaps, repetition is their strong point. Repetition and reconstruction being their regular features they bear a study ever and anon. So much has been written in the past by eminent scholars. The present study is a humble attempt to know them as far as possible. Hence the writer submits : Kati kavayab kati krtayab kati luptāķ kati caranti kati sithilāļj / Tad api pravartayati mãm nigamoktākhyānasamvidhānehā //33 The study of ancient lore has to be approached with faith, free from modern materialistic prejudices which have hampered true appreciation and rendered criticism more destructive than constructive. Those who indulge in the destruc- tive type had better keep away ; it is in this spirit that the parable of Goddess Vidya is repeated by several Vedic schools for the edification of the earnest student : Vidyã ha vai brāhmaņam ājagāma Gopâya mā ševadhiste'ham asmi / Asūyakāyānrjave'yatāya Na mā brūyā viry a vati tathā syām // Ya ãtrnattyavitathena karņā- Vaduķkham kurvannamrtam samprayacchan / Tam manyeta pitaram mataram ca Tasmai na druhyet katamaccanāha // Adhyãpitã ye gurum nâdriyante Viprā vãcã manasā karmaņā vā / Yathaiva te na guror bhojanïyâs tathaiva tān na bhunakti srutam tat // Yam èva vidyãb šucim apramattam Medhāvinam brahmacaryopapannam / 32.

HARIYAPPA Yas te na druhyet katamaccanāha Tasmai mā brûyâ nidhipâya brahman //34 Goddess Vidyã once approached the Brāhmaņa and said : ' Protect me, I am thy treasure. Impart me not to any one who is envious, not straightforward and who has no self-control, so will I remain a source of strength. (A student) should regard him, as father and as mother, who fills the ears with Truth without causing pain but pouring nectar. By no means should a student prove treacherous to him. Those vipras (learned pupils) who, though instructed, will not respect the Teacher in thought, word and deed shall deserve no favour from the Teacher; similarly, too, the knowledge (so obtained) shall not favour them. Therefore, O Brahman, thou shalt impart me only to him who will keep the trust, whom thou thinkest to be pure and. ņot heedless, intelligent and devoted to his duties as a student and who would by no means prove; treacherous to thee.' Mythology, in general, may be described as a historical and scientific study of myths and legends ; the whole body of divine, heroic and cosmogonie legends come under its purview. Myths and legends are classified as meteorological, physical, historical, ritualistic, artistic, ethical, mystical, or allegorical and so on. Myths are traditional, having had their source often in individual imagination. Psychologically, the function of myth, is to strengthen tradition and endow it with a greater value and prestige by tracing it back to a higher, better and more super- natural reality of ancient events. " From myth spring the epic romance and tragedy. Myth, therefore, touches the deepest desires of man - his fears, his hopes, his passions, his sentiments as it validates the social order, justifies the existing social scheme and ráňgeé from expressions of sheer artistry to legalism." Myth in common parlance savours of what is untrue, unreal, all the same it has a hold on man's imagination. There is a certain amount of rational element in it, as, for instance, in the myths relating to the Dawn and the Sun. Sometimes, the irrational element, as in the story of the Creator himself committing incest, renders a myth repugnant. Plato would reject such untrustworthy stories of gods from his ideal State ! The study of mythology is obscure and difficult but when rightly and cautiously pursued it abounds with evidence as to the primitive aspirations and beliefs of mankind and as to the various stages of moral and intellectual development.35 In the present study, by legend is meant a story which describes an ancient event in which the characters are from, or are akin to, mankind and in which, the emotions and experiences, such as those of human beings are described. In this way, it differs from a myth which is more often than not a fanciful representation of a 34.

Thus the solar and lunar myths were brought home by Max Müller in his numerous writings. Sometimes, indeed, a concrete legend, like that of Sarama or Purūravas, was harnessed into a myth. Sarama, Indra's messenger (Indrasya dūtīti) - not the watch-dog of the gods (devasunî) as she somehow came to be designated later - went to the Paņis and demanded the release of Indra's cattle ; with Sarama as guide, Indra found the Paņis, destroyed them and re- covered the cattle. These concrete lines are rendered into evanescent myth stating that Saramā the Dawn, signalling the dispelling of darkness, heralds the advent of Indra's cattle viz . the Sun's rays. The immortal lovers, Purūravas and Urvasi, are, mythically, the Sun and the Dawn. The birth of the sage Vasistha from Urvasi is, again, the birth of the Sun from the Dawn. Which to choose and cherish, legend or myth, mankind decided ; the myth gradually receded to the background but the legend held on. It caught the imagination of men and began to thrive on it, being harnessed at will for their own ends and purposes. For when man began to narrate a story, he put his own mind into it, so much so the original out- lines were entirely missed or misrepresented. But then the history of the legends proves that they are almost beside the truth ; why should they be studied ? It is precisely to know the real basis of the legends, the transformation that time wrought upon them, the consistency and the logical necessity of such transforma- tion and finally the reaction of the people who stored them as a rich heritage. V ITIHĀSA-TRADITION Our legends have a hoary past ; their roots extend to the Vedas themselves. Known by the comprehensive name, Itihāsa (iti ha āsa = thus, indeed, it was), they constituted a necessary adjunct to the four Vedas, because, Itihāsa is described as the fifth Veda.36 According to Kautilya's Arthašāstra,37 Itihāsa comprises purāņa (old legends), itivrtta (history), ākhyāyikā (fables), udāharaņa (illustrative stories), dharmašāstra (codes of law) and arthašāstra (political science). The king is expected to spend the afternoon in listening to these sources of knowledge. Thus Itihāsa gives us the impression that it is not a single work but a species of literary productions. But this range was acquired by the time of Kautilya (4th cent. B.C. ?) In the early literature, we find numerous references to Itihāsa, Purāņa and Itihāsa-purāņa etc. But if they were actually composed, they do not exist today. Max Müller38 thought that the Rāmāyaņa and the Mbh. have taken their place and 36. Chāndogya-Up. VII 1 f and 7, Buddhist Suttanipāta III 7, both referred to by Winter- nitz. HIL p. 313 and n2, 3. 37.

It is one view that the old itihãsas of the Vedic period were handed by oral tradition only ; they had no fixed text. On the other hand, Sieg thinks that its vestiges are found scattered over the different branches of Vedic literature, the Brāhmanas, the Sütras etc.39 If we reflect upon the whole problem, the existence of an Itihāsa-tradition even at the time of the Rgvedic compilation, nay, even before when the hymns were being seen or composed, cannot be doubted. It did not require a Sūta Lomaharsaņa to narrate the legends in assemblies, for in the life of the Vedic community and the extent of its holdings which were limited, the stories were well-known and did not require any discourse thereupon. But later on there came the Age of the Brāhmaņas which was dominated by ritual. Looking at the laborious exegetical attempts and far-fetched grammatical fancies of this ritual literature, one is driven to suspect a long break in Vedic tradition,40 with the result that fact was substituted by fancy in the reconstruction of old tradition (purāņa). Purāņa assumed a definite status and came to be considered a regular part of any sacrificial programme.41 As time rolled on, the Itihāsa grew in proportion and finally was set down to record through the Epics and Purāņas. By the time of Yâska, a regular class of thinkers is recognised called the Aitihāsikas.42 They interpreted the Veda from the legendary point of view. For other points of view, there were the Niruktas43 (etymologists), Yäjnikas44 and Pürve-yäjnikas45 (Sacrificial school, old and new), and the Vaiyäkaranas46 (Gram- marians). To this we should add an Astronomical school ( Jyautisakas) who attempt to locate a star in the firmament for every hero of the Veda. We have heard of the most popular story of Orion being no other than the famous Iksvāku king Trisañku. In the same manner other constellations also, it must be possible to identify; hence the origin and growth of a series of legends always harping upon the starry heavens. It is not a very popular school, though as is seen in individual cases, it became a regular hobby of a few scholars. Remarkable are Dr. R. Shama Sastry's books and articles in this direction, contributed to various journals in India.47 With the spread of Vedic studies in the West, a new school of interpretation was initiated by Rudolph Roth, which may be designated as the Philological or Linguistic 39.

Wilson, Colebrooke49 and others recognised a Traditional School, reflected in the Commentary of Sayana whom the former considered as the safest guide through the intricacies and obscurities of the text. This classification is not complete if a reference is not made to some scholars who perceive nothing but philosophy in the Vedic mantras. They form the Ãdhyãtmika or Philosophic School.50 Of the eight Schools of Vedic Thought and Interpretation adverted to above, viz. : Nairuktas (Etymologists) Yajñikas (Ritualists) Vaiyâkaranas (Grammarians) Jyautisakas (Astronomers) Bhāsāvids (Linguists of the West) Sampradayavids (Traditionists) Adhyãtmavids (Philosophers), and Aitihāsikas (' Legendarians ') the first seven became the province of the student and the specialist, while the last came to edify the common man. Thus developed the vast literature of the Epics and the Purāņas to entertain and instruct the commonalty. Regard- ing Vedic interpretation, the present outlook is one of via media . It takes into account all the aspects above recapitulated before deciding upon the meaning of a passage. With the researches of Maurice Bloomfield on the subject of " Rgevda Repetitions, "5oa a study of all the contexts in which a pāda or a verse occurred, became necessary, with very satisfactory results. Thus a critical and comparative outlook, which does not lose sight of the tradition or sampradãya, characterises the modern method of interpreting the Veda.51 VI THE PLACE OF LEGEND IN NATIONAL LIFE It must be noted that no story is actually told in the Rgveda, but many inci- dents and circumstances are definitely alluded to.

Vasistha and Visvāmitra each had enemies but it is not certain whether they were enemies of each other. While for the truthful happenings we turn our eyes to the most original document the Rgveda, the gradual transformation which sometimes changed the complexion in toto is not without significance inasmuch as it reflects the cultural phases in the fortunes of the Aryans in India and their thorough assimi- lation with the native populace. The original purity of concept and character had had to be mixed up with the complicated and undeveloped notions that prevailed in the atmosphere of their new possessions. The same stories had to be retold and reinterpreted. Gods and men sat together at the sacrifices in the Vedic Age, but later the distance between god and man began to widen. Man expanded, propagat- ed and became a problem for himself. Far removed from divinity he was natural- ly to doubt it. Fresh impetus had to be put into Vedic lore -thus grew the several strata of literature and legend which were evolved from time to time, spontaneous- ly, to hold together the peoples and their beliefs. Thus in the beginning, gods came to the earth often times ; it was their sporting ground. But when the land became crowded with mortals, the visits of the im- mortals became few and far between. They had to be summoned with great ceremony and sacrifice or after severe self-mortification by a process called penance. It was the privilege of some, however, to visit the Immortals in heaven off and on for negotiations on behalf of mankind ; a few celebrated kings were even honoured with invitations to help the gods in their fights against the demons. Later on this choice for divine favour also became a thing of the past. Gods became in- visible and would of course favour their devotee as such, provided he faithfully discharged all his duties by them as required by the šāstras. When Gods dis- appeared from mortal approach, šāstras about them became more and more elab- orate ; thus worship of the God at home and in common with the others at temples became an art by itself substituting for the no longer tenable Sacrifice. As the community expanded, their wants became many and varied ; their functions also differed accordingly. Their outlook now was more mundane. Now and then, of course, the hunger of the soul asserted itself ; the monotony of existence, the transitoriness of life, birth and death, above all, the futility of appeal to an in- visible God - these ideas began to sway over the mind of the commonalty. At such a time, the service rendered by the epics and the Purāņas for enlivening the souls of the people can hardly be exaggerated. Here did Lomaharsaņa52 earn the grati- tude of all, by presenting the ancient legends to the people in a manner that pleased their minds and whetted their hearts' yearning for a tangible knowledge, if not vision, of the Ultimate or the Absolute. The continuity of the teachings of the sacred Vedas was also established by the dictum- 52. The Vayu Furāņa justifies his name (I 16) : Lomāni harsayâftcakre srotīņām yat subhāsitaih / Karmaņā prathitas teņa loke'smin komaharsaníih ././</page><page sequence="13">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES I35 Itihāsapurāņābhyām Vedam samupabrmhayet / Bibhetyalpašrutad vedo mām ay am prahared iti //53 The Veda should be well amplified by means of Itihāsa and Purāņa ; the Veda fears a man of little knowledge as he might maim it thereby. Thus the popular mind was satisfied with the sanctity of the Epics and the Purāņas as they were, logically, exhaustive commentaries of the Veda and its tradition. Even otherwise, the medium of legend to communicate religious and even philosophical ideas has been found fruitful through Ages. Nothing can exert greater credence on the human mind than when it is described as having happened. " Thus, indeed, it was " (Iti-ha-āsa) combines with narration, a stamp of authority. And when, now and then, an appeal is made to former authorities by means of statements like, Atrapy udāharantīmam itihāsam purātanam etc., the belief is firmly rooted. Philosophers, who claim to think of God from a higher plane on the strength of having imbibed the quintessence of worldly experience separating the grain from the chaff, are prone to set less value to the legends, as, they say, for instance, Plato would allow no foothold for the fanciful myths about gods and angels in his ideal State. But, for the average man with his preoccupations - and his class forms the teeming millions - a set of prepared tt ideas about the Supreme Power is necessary, ideas which emanate from thinkers or prophets who have had communion with the Holy God. The average man, again, would feel gratified to find some concrete story on which his Faith can lay anchor, or even some concrete object on which he can superimpose all his conception of God, the Gracious and the All-powerful. This deep yearning of the soul is represented by what Prof. Otto calls the " numino- us "in man, which feels or realises and is fascinated by the adbhuta and the acintya in God (Mysterium tremendum) ; and which ultimately leads him to rapturous emotions of love and surrender (bhakti) to the great God.54 The temple and the church on the one hand and the Sāgas and the Epics on the other have proved to be substantial contributions to foster the " numinous," and have, therefore, very rightly deserved the popularity they enjoy. If a nation is to be united it is by the Tradition it inherits and cherishes. And India's unshakable belief and regard for tradition has been writ large in the Great Epics and in the Purāņas and has been upheld by the sky-scraping towers of temples. One great point about Itihāsa is that it appeals to all classes. Unfortunately, India is torn by an abuse of the Caste System. Whether the Caste System (cātur- varnya) was responsible for the degradation of Indian Society, or an abuse thereof, is a matter of opinion. All the same, the distinction of varņa (caste) by the accident of birth and not by the actuality of profession has been the bane of our social structure. True, there is the doctrine of Karma to support the distinction by birth. It is agelong and has been a potent factor of our Religion. But our 53. Mbh. I 267. 54. Cf. M.

And God's original order conveyed in the following statement : - Na višeso'sti varņānām sarvam brahmani idam jagat / Brahmaņā pūrvasrstam hi karmabhir varņatām gatam // " There is no distinction of castes. This world, which, as created by Brahmā, was at first entirely Brāhmanic, has become divided into classes in consequence of men's deeds." - deserves to be reharnessed for the good of humanity. Such upheavels have come upon us often times and the Smrtis and the Šāstras have been alive for the changes and have conformed to them ; e.g. Parāšara-smrti is to be followed in Kali-yuga, and not Manu, the first law-giver (Kalau Pārāšarafr smrtab). A fresh structure has to be built upon old traditions ; the great litera- ture of the ancients, of which of course we can always be proud, has to be read in a new light which has just radiated through the horizon. The sociological aspect of the legends is as important as their religious aspect. In them are reflected the successive stages of culture and civilisation. The Itihāsa- purāņa as revealed in the Vedic texts gives us a picture of ancient Society, at least in its outlines. The next stages are marked by the appearnce of the Epics, of the Purāņas and of belles-lettres, these categories being for the most part contempor- aneous in the few centuries that preceded and succeeded the Christian era. A third aspect of the legend is didactic. Through the stories of the lives of great men and through the teachings of sages and seers retold in simple mould and easy language, the Itihāsa provided ethical instruction to society, together with philosophical doctrines. Incidental to these aspects, much miscellaneous matter also found its way into the Purāņas like the genealogies of kings, their rule over various kingdoms of the historic and prehistoric past, the rivers and mountains, more than all the holy spots situated on them (tirthas) etc. so much so that the Purāņas developed a technique of their own, which expressed itself in the five characteristics : - Sargas ca pratisaragaš ca vamso manvantarāņi ca / Vamsānucaritam ceti Purāņam pancalaksaņam // - - Creation ; re-creation i.e. periodical annihilation and renewal of the worlds ; genealogy (of gods and rsis) ; the millennia i.e. the great periods each of which has a Manu or primal ancestor of the human race ; and the history of the dynasties viz. early and later dynasties whose origin is traced back to the sun (solar dynasty) and the moon (lunar dynasty).56 Thus we see that the legendary tradition, ex- pressed through the medium of the Epics and the Purāņas, knit itself into the life of Society, being a source at once of pleasure and instruction. 55.

The subject is hackneyed enough ; nevertheless, every scholar permits himself to enter into the subject, for, at one time or other in the course of his study, he is sure to wonder within his mind, what might be the age of the RV, which happens to be oldest literary monument of the Human Race ! In answer to this question, it is wise, perhaps, to say : RV is the oldest in age among literary productions, and be content. What with the doctrine of Revelation (apauruseyatva) which recognised nothing like a beginning for the Veda, and with the data provided by the theory of yuga and mahayuga, pralaya and mahäpralaya, the earthly year and the celestial year and so on ; what with, on the other hand, the linguistic, historical, archaeological and astronomical evidences ransacked and wrested from their hidings with marvellous genius, industry and tact by the great scholars of the nine- teenth and twentieth centuries - the Age of the RV is still a mirage to grapple with. The world of scholars bestirred itself once again after the discovery of the cuneiform tablets at Tel-el- Amarna in Upper Egypt and the discovery of the Inscriptions at Boghaz-Koi (North Mesopotamia) dating from 1600 to 1400 B.C.57 They speak of names of Mitani kings with the prefix " Arta " which is reminiscent of Vedic Rta; and reference is found to the Vedic gods, Mitra, Varuna, Indra and Näsatyau. This raised problems not only concerning the age of the RV, but also regarding the original home of the Aryans and the theory of their migration. In the opinion of Keith,58 " misplaced confidence in the Parsi tradition which dates Zoroaster three hundred years before Alexander,59 has resulted in endless confusion and difficulty." On the evidence of the language of the Avesta which bears close resemblance to that of the RV, the common belief is that the Aryans came down to Iran from their original home, Central Asia, and then a branch of theirs moved on to India. The activities of the Indian branch, the chief one being the compilation of RV Samhitā, began after their separation from the Iranian Settlements. The accept- ance of this view has put an unjustly severe restraint on Vedic chronology. To squeeze in so much of literature and history from Zarathushtra' s date - the Rgvedic compilation, the growth of the Brāhmaņas, the Sūtras and the Upanisads, Yãska, Panini, Mahāvīra, the Buddha, our Epics, and all before Alexander invaded India : 326 B.C. - is impossible ! Consider, on the other hand, the possibility of 57. Cf. Bloomfield, Rei. Veda, pp. 11-12. Keith RPV, pp. 5, 83, 617, Wintrenitz HIL pp. 304-6, Dhalla, HZ pp. 9, 47, 269, 270. 58. Bhand. Comm.

That is a major problem. At any rate having had a sufficiently long and comfortable life in the Land of the Five or Seven Rivers (Punjab and N.W.F.), one branch, evidently the dissenters, went westwards, whereas another spread eastward to Madhya-desa and further to Bengal and down to the South. After the western branch migrated to Iran, soon or late, rose Zoroaster ; the Gāthās were sung in the language known as Avesta. Even then there should be no objection to the close resemblances between the Vedic and Avestic languages. Just as the eastern branch came in contact with the original inhabitants and underwent transformation in thought and doing, so also the Iranian section mingled with the native populace and became subject to new influences. Differences grew ; the outlook changed ; they became poles apart. Conflict and conquest followed as a natural result. Remembering their old hatred, as it were, there were in historic times a series of invasions and depredations back on their old home, India. Now comes the discovery of the Indus Valley civilization61 envisaged by the finds at Harappa and Mohenjodaro. No definite decision has yet been reached regarding its age in general or its age in relation to RV in particular. The most generally accepted view up to now is that it is pre-Rgvedic ; some hold that it is based on the Rgvedic civilization only and that the unearthed cities and the seals betray contemporaneity with features and events of Rgvedic life. There is a third postulate that the I-V Culture is entirely Dra vidian in character. It is beside the present purpose to go into a discussion of the various problems and controversies, when the entire study thereof is still in a nebulous condition. The position is clearly set forth in the following passage : " The finds unearthed at the prehistoric sites provide many interesting, important an intriguing points such as the date of the civilization ; its authorship - whether it is Aryan, pre-Aryan, Dravidian or Sumerian etc. ; its relationship with 60. Keith is not unfavourable. Cf. RPV. 5-7, 44 we are, therefore, still left without any definite evidence to aid us in dating the distinction of Aryan into Iranian and Indian, and we should probably revise our conception of this division." Ibid. p. 617. Winternitz is quite favourable 44 We shall have to assume that, just as there were Aryan immigrations into India from the west, there must have been isolated migrations back to the west." HIL, p. 305. On the other hand, Dhalla claims : Of the various sections of the Aryan family, the ancestors of those that later became known in history as the Indians and the Iranians lived longest and closest together in Eastern Iran. They sacrificed to the same gods and entertained the same view of life on earth. They separated at a later period and a group turned to the south, crossed the Hindukush and entered the Punjab by about 2000 B.C. Of the various groups that separated from the main stock at different times, the Iranian group preserved most faithfully the original name of the primeval home of the Aryans. The place of residence had changed, surroundings had altered beyond recognition and the communities that lived and shared life with them had gone. But the deeply cherished name AIRYANA- V A YE J AH (The Stem-Land of the Aryans) had been indelibly impressed on their minds." HZ p. 10. On p. xxxi he says : 44 The time when Zoroaster flourished is a moot question. The approximate date at which he lived is 1000 B.C." 61. One is greatly indebted to Dr. R. N. Dandekar for a very useful bibliography on the I-V civilization. Vide his 44 Vedic Bibliography " (NIA publication, Bombay* 1946) Sections 156-162 or pp, 281-303.</page><page sequence="17">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES I39 other cultures ; its extent ; the religion and culture disclosed by it ; the Indus Script, etc." And " a somewhat satisfactory solution of these problems can be obtained when we discover strata bearing on Vedic settlements and showing their relative chronological position to the Indus civilization. Excavation along the banks of Sarasvatī and Drsadvat! in the homeland of the Vedic Aryans will go a long way, in providing ample valuable material. The satisfactory decipherment of the Indus Script which has hitherto baffled all attempts will give an unimpeach- able and incontrovertible piece of evidence. Scholars have so long approached the problem with preconceived notions and consequently have read their own theories into the so-called Indus Seal writings. The discovery of a bi-lingual inscription will undoubtedly supply us with a clue to solve the mystery w.hich is shrouding the problems."62 Reverting to the Age of the Rgveda,63 we can only register the dates assigned by various scholars from 1000 B.C. to 25000 B.C. Max Müller assigned 1500-1200, Weber 16th cent., Haug 2400-1400, Whitney 2000-1400, Kaegi 2000-1500, Winternitz, 2500 or 2000-750 or 500, Jacobi 4500-2500, Tilak 6000, Veñkatesvara 11,000 and A.C. Dās 25,000 etc. - all before Christ. It is well to recall a statement made by Max Müller himself long ago. "It is far better to show the different layers of thought that produced the Vedic Religion, and thus to give an appro- ximate idea of its long growth, than to attempt to measure it by years or centuries, which can never be more than guess work."64 What applies to Vedic Thought applies to Vedic Literature as well. VIII RGVEDIC LEGENDS These are numerous indeed. Šaunaka's Brhaddevatā is a land-mark in the study of the legends as it is the most ancient text to narrate, briefly of course, as many as forty legends, which are amplifications of the Rgvedic nucleus. The Sarvānukramaņī of Kãtyãyana offers similar material ; Sadgurušisya expands many of the legends. Finally, Säyana's prefatory notes to the hymns referring to past stories are very helpful. With a survey of Säyana's commentary, the vast legendary matter could be gathered. Over seventy-five adventures of Indra are mentioned. Apart from the display of his strength against his adversaries, Indra, as is well-known, freely and bounteously bestows wealth upon the sacrificer. He also helps people in distress. In this respect, the record of the Ašvins is as bright if not brighter. They are the divine physicians and surgeons who have made themselves responsible for the well-being of all in their province. They supply artificial legs to those who are wounded in battle, they save people from shipwreck and remove blindness and 62. A. D.

The references are to RV Mandala, sūkta, stanza. Mandala is always shown in Roman figures. The stories are either suggested in the stanzas referred to or are stated by authorities in connection with the stanzas. 66. Bloomfield remarked " Even animals are helped or cured by them. In one instance, they perform a cure calculated to make green with envy even the most skilled of modern vet- erinary surgeons, if by any chance, they should hear of it.

There is, frankly speaking, nothing which justifies the interpreter in looking for anthropomorphic or therio- morphic motives at the bottom of it. If these ever existed, they have vanished from record. Why should they, indeed, have existed ? Indra, the demiurge of the Vedic texts, encounters demons, for instance, and deals with them according to the fancy of the story-teller. Indra, to be sure, is very largely a storm-God who attacks the clouds and other natural phenomena personified as demons ; but, he is also the heroic person Indra and, in his latter capacity the very one to become embroiled with all sorts of uncanny beings such as inhabited the fancy of the Vedic people. There is much truth in this dictum. Let us take an instance : the Hounds of Yama, Šyama and Šabala. The mythologists would not permit them to be fancied as hounds at all. Bloomfield himself identifies them as the Sun and the Moon. Others see the west wind and the south wind in them. Similarly, Sarama is the Storm-Goddess, her sons, Särameyau, gods of wind. Vasistha is no other than the Sun, being the son of Urvasi who is no other than the Dawn. In the opinion of another scholar, the Eclipse Code of the Rgvedic Aryans is revealed in the Šunaššepa hymns.68 The author says, " The fundamental cycle of the Šunaššepa hymns is one of 2760 days of eight nodal years. The basis of this inference is the number of letters in the seven hymns taken together which is 2768." Further, " According to the legend of Šunaššepa, Rohita wandered in the wild for seven years, this period amounts to 7X354-4 or 2480-4 days. Rohita paid 300 cows to Ajigarta for complete liberation. In Vedic phraseology a cow means a day (vide Gavam-ayana by Dr. Shama Sastry). Therefore 300 cows mean 300 days. Hence the total Rohita period amounts to 2480-4 days... All these several values deduced from independent sets of data agree closely among themselves and support the inference that the basic period of the Rgvedic eclipse cycle was 188 Parvas.' The erudition and imagination behind these views of the specialists cannot and need not be denied. If the hymns originally meant it all is a question which scholars have patiently to reflect upon. The rational view is that RV is a human document, the gods are man-made, they have human characteristics, in other words they are conceived in a human mould.69 Therefore it is fair that they and their lives have primarily to be looked at from the stand-point of human values. If the hymns contemplated any mythical motive that the Hounds of Heaven are the Sun and the Moon, or that Sarama is the Storm-Goddess or Vasistha is the Sun, one wonders why the Veda would not state it ; what harm ? On the other hand, what harm is there to believe that there were two real hounds in the service of Yama ; they, 68. M. Raja Rao, The Eclipse Code of the Rgvedic Aryans as revealed in Šunaššepa hymns and Brāhmaņas. PO. Vol. VI (1942) pp. 1-26.

The RV Samhitā counts syllables 432,000 which is the extent of Kali-yuga in years, curiously (A Govindâcãrya-swãmin). In the Brāhmaņ- as, many numerical coincidences between several sacrificial aspects and the seasons, years and months etc. are found or forced. In the chapter on Šunaššepa following, it is pointed out that there is no correspondence at all between the hymns and the Šunaššepa legend. The hymns are ascribed, by tradition, to his seership and not with reference to the circumstances of the Seer's life. 69. Cf. M. Hiriyanna, Outlines of Indian Philosophy, p. 31.</page><page sequence="21">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES I43 like so many other supernatural or superhuman things, are justified in their exist- ence, as conceived by the Vedic folk. One, perhaps, need not and should not strain so much regarding identities. Vedic Faith has painted a certain picture of heaven. Some of its lines may point to Nature or Allegory or Sky. Still there would remain a large part of it to understand which we have to invoke Faith. Why not assign everything to Faith and be pleased with a state of things, reported as having existed once upon a time (iti-ha-āsa)? No purpose is served by strained identifications. What special achievement of fancy of the Vedic poet it was to view the sun and moon, who are the very Light of our existence, as the hounds of Yama, and why exert to reconcile the canine attributes with those world- sustaining qualities of the Heavenly Ones ? It is hard to understand how Bloom- field departed from his own principle, above-mentioned. The case is strong, however, to set human values in the first place. In the second place, Bloomfield recommends giving up the belief that the allusions to the story which may be gathered from the scattered mantras are the only true material for its reconstruction. He would like to view the entire evidence as one whole - evidence provided by the legends of the Brāhmaņas and the Sūtras as well, because they would be based on the same conception as the mantras. Ad hoc touches, which are inevitable while handing the story from person to person, inspired by practical matters like sacrifice and witchcraft, have to be dealt with what may be called tact. 41 The proper attitude is," Bloomfield declares, " on the one hand, neither implicit faith in every detail of the connected legends and in every symbolic employment of the legend in ritualistic practice; on the other hand, a growing faith in the synchronism of mantra, brāhmaņa and sūtra. As far as the first two are concerned, the writer is more and more inclined to the belief that mantra and brāhmaņa are for the least part chronological distinctions, that they represent two modes of literary activity and two modes of literary speech, which are largely contemporaneous, the mantras being the earliest lyric and the brāhamņas, the earliest epic-didactic manifestation of the same cycle of thought. Both forms existed together, for aught we know, from the earliest times, only the redaction of the mantra-collections in their present arrangement seems on the whole to have preceded the redaction of the brāhmaņas. At any rate, I, for my part, am incapable of believing that even a single Vedic hymn was ever composed without reference to ritual application, and without that environment of legendary report which we find in a no doubt exaggerated and distended form in the Brāhmaņas and Sūtras." The postulates herein embodied are difficult of acceptance. Firstly mantra and brāhmaņa are largely contemporaneous and they are for the least part chronological distinctions. The mantras and brāhmaņas may have co -existed tiut we have to consider the texts that have been handed down to us. The mantra did not admit the play of a later hand, while the Brāhamņa did not escape it. The Šunašsepa legend is an example. The oldest Brāhmaņa aîid a text that is neatest the original hymns is the Aitareya. While the RV makes the barest meņtioA of the legend, there is a full and finished narrative thereof in the AB. From the point of view of historical development, the eļaķor^tioņ is remarkable and must</page><page sequence="22">144 H- L- HARIYAPPA presuppose certain intermediate stages to justify the inclusion of HarišcandraV episode in the beginning and Višvāmitra's at the end. Macdonell and Winternitz are of opinion that there is a wide gap of time between the mantra age and brāh- maņa age.70 That no hymn of the Veda was ever composed without reference to ritual application is only an argument advanced by its author for the occasion ; for, it is universally acknowledged that the hymns of the RV are poetry first and then everything else. In them we find "the first outpourings of the human mind, the glow of poetry, the rapture at nature's loveliness and mystery."71 Bloomfielďs reference to tact in handling the evidence supplied by the various texts of different ages is instructive. It stands to reason that in the historical study of the evolution of a legend there ought to be no place for preconceived notions. The material should be assessed just as it is presented, the changes noted from the earlier stage to a later stage and a logical conclusion established. For example, to develop a line of thought that all along the literature of ancient India, the brāhmanic tradi- tion has held sway, the priestly class saw to its supremacy everywhere, in literature as well as in Society72: - these are impressions formed in the 19th and 20th centuries about things that transpired in ancient times ; they are, in Bloomfielďs own ex- pression, "judgments based upon schematic principles." Verily so. The authors of such interpretations forget to assess the conditions of the times which resulted in this or that happening. One thing stands out for all time and against all dissection and scrutiny of the ancient past. In the fourfold classification of society - whether on the basis of birth or profession - the precedence was, by unanimous approval, established as Brāhmaņa, Ksatriya, Vaišya and Šūdra. Each class was expected to discharge its specific duties. The system was welcome and so long as every one adhered to his dharma, there could be no room for unhappiness or unrest. With the convulsions of time, however dharma deteriorated everywhere. Society, under extraneous circumstances, was subject to authoritarian influences of alien cultures, alien customs, alien thought. The whole outlook changed. Looking back from the threshold of a New World, to pass judgment on the ancient past betrays a serious want of " tact." This section may close with two observations: (1) the Rgvedic Legends, if not the whole Samhitā, may be viewed from the stand-point of human values. They inculcate ideas and describe deeds which are nearest to the immediate well- being of mankind. Other connotations are either secondary or accidental. (2) The whole of Ancient Culture, as well as Rgvedic, may be viewed in proper perspective, having regard to conditions of the Age under study. A view through the telescope, 70. The subject is fully discussed in a subsequent chapter. 71. Nehru, Discovery of India (Signet Press), Calcutta, 1946, p. 78. An authority selected at random only. Older scholars like Max Müller, Macdonell and others have appreciated the poetical merit of RV hymns. 72. Western scholarship, probably without exception, has succumbed to this sort of im- pression, in spite of the fact that they profess a dispassionate outlook. They are all praise for so many meritorious features in Ancient Indian Culture, which enjoyed a social solidarity and which had a Dharma to recommend for all time.

IX LESSONS PROM THE LEGENDS The Legends of the RV provide a great variety. The fight between the gods and demons and the wars of kings signify a state of immense action in which the entire man power was engaged. In time of peace the whole community sacrificed to the agents of their victory, glory and happiness, whom they called gods. And the gods freely mixed with mortals. They exchanged favours73 : men sacrificed to please the gods with the soma and the purodāša ; in return, they gave them reward in kind, comfort and progeny. The Rgvedic seer appeals for gods' favour in a variety of ways, with such persuasive wit as will move the most unwilling god shower his best favours on him. And the gods were full of solicitude for mankind as is evident from the innumerable instances of succour given by Indra and the Asvins, recorded in the previous section. The mission of Sarama is an example of how on such occasions uprightness and sagacity will pay. Šunaásepa illustrates the faith of man and the grace of God. In Vasistha, one sees the height of excel- lence that Man could reach and in Višvāmitra the glory of perfection that Man could achieve by his own endeavour (purusa-kāra). Their hatred towards each other, if at all, was transitory ; it is possible to deny it, but nothing unnatural if they have momentarily given in to human passions. All stories that developed in later times must be ascribed to fancy. What more lessons need we look for in the legends, than an exhortation to be strong and brave warriors, to protect the distressed, to be generous and solicitous to one another, to give and to take gifts, to be truthful and be free from jealousy, in short, to respect God and to love Man ? There are other legends indicated in RV which pertain to the lives of individual personages. They savour of an unethical element which might have pervaded in the society of those days. One hears the story of Vasistha's birth with a sense of disappointment at the nakedness of a lustful act. The birth of other eminent sages as well, is shrouded in mystery. Prajāpati, desirous of progeny, conducted a 3-year sacrifice in the presence of all gods.74 There came the goddess of Speech (Vāc) in bodily form. Seeing her, semen effused from both Ka (Prajāpati) and Varuna. Vâyu by chance blew it into the Fire ; from the flames was Bhrgu born and from the cinders, Añgiras. But Vāc, on seeing the two sons, said to Prajāpati, " May a third seer also, in addition to these two, be born to me as a son." " So be it," said the Creator. Then the seer Atri was born, equal in splendour to Sun and Fire. Coming to more human affairs, there is the following story of the birth 78.

She was enceinte . But Brhaspati got fascinat- ed and enjoyed with her. At the time of the effusion of semen, the one already inside the womb cried out, " O Sage, do not discharge. I am here first and may you not cause an admixture of seed." Controlling himself with great difficulty, Brhaspati cursed the seed in the womb that, because it caused frustration to his impulse, it should be born blind and be so for long. Thus cursed, Dīrghatamas Was born of Mamatā. After birth he praised Agni and he was pleased to remove the blindness". The sage became a celebrated Seer of hymns. Visvāmitra's birth also is not free from complicity. He was born of Gadhi's wife through the grace of the son-in-law, Rcika, who, on request, prepared the holy caru for his mother-in- law as well as for his wife.76 The Indra- Ahalyä episode is well-known.77 Several more instances of " ethical aberrations," as Hopkins calls them78 may be added, but no need. It must undoubtedly be confessed that so long as humanity is subject to the call of the lower passions, which is so in God's dispensation ever since Creation, this ethical aspect remains the same in all ages and at áll climes. It is perhaps a challenge that God has thrown out before Man. The merit lies in accepting it and transcending high above the ordinary. The ancient sāstras have recognised these aberrations as examples to be avoided only, and never to be followed. " Though fnan ought to imitate the seers and gods, yet man may not imitate their mis- demeanors, because those divine beings had more lustre than men today ánd being so glorious they might do what ordinary men may not do."79 Says an epic sage : "Cease to cite these famous transgressions... do thysélf what is suitable and proper."80 Let us hear Colebrooke : " The aberrations of the human mind are a pàrt of its history. It is neither uninteresting nor useless, to ascertain what it is that ingenious men have done, and contemplative minds have thought, in former times, even where they have erred, especially where their error had been graced by elegance, or redeemed by tasteful fancy. Mythology then, however futile, must, for those reasons, be noticed. It influences the manners, it pervades the literature of nations which have admitted it."81 It will be fitting to conclude with the views on Mythology, so well and frankly expressed by the first gentleman of India82 today, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru : " Mythology affected me in much the same way. If people believed in the factual contents of these stroies, the whole thing was absurd and 75. Sayana's prefatory note to RV I 147.3. 76. See infra ch. IV, the story is related in Mbh. and Han. 77.

But as soon as one ceased believing in them, they appeared in a new light, a new beauty, a wonderful flowering of a richly endowed imagination, full of human lessons. No one believes now in the stories of Greek gods and goddesses and so, without any difficulty, we can admire them and they become part of our mental heritage. But if we had to believe in them what a burden it woiild be, and how, oppressed by this weight of belief, we would often miss their beauty. Indian mythology is richer, vaster, very beautiful and full of meaning. I have often wondered what manner of men and women they were who gave shape to these bright dreams and lovely fancies, and out of what gold mine of thought and imagination they dug them out."83 83.

But nowhere in the Rgveda is she referred to belong to the canine species.1 She is only Indra's messenger (Indrasyadutifc-RV 10 • 108 • 2), That she is the mother of dogs appears to be a later belief originating in the word Sarameyau (Yama's hounds) which sounds like a matronymic from Sarama, 44 Saramā' s offspring." Yäska refers to her as devasuni2 (' the divine bitch '). The later Vedic commentators indeed follow him.3 The Brhaddevatā4 spins a long story, according to which, Indra deputes Sarama to find out his cattle lifted and hidden by a demon tribe called the Paņis. Sarama crosses the big river Rasā and succeeds in finding out Indra's cattle, but falls a victim to the temptations of the Paņis, drinks milk offered by them, returns and on enquiry denies all knowledge of the kine or the Paņis. Indra gives her a kick, she runs vomiting the milk, Indra follows the track and vanquishes the offenders, the cattle are recovered. The BD account thus casts a reflection on the character of Sarama. But the version in the Jaiminiya Brāhmaņa6 is different, 1. This fact has been noticed by many scholars. Max Müller, ASL 2. p. 467. Keith HPV, p. 192. Macdonell VM p. 151, E. D.

According to these two texts, Indra first deputes Suparņa for the purpose. He proves disloyal. Then Indra sends Sarama who imposes a condition that he should give the cows' milk as food for her offspring. This was promised and she successfully scouted the enemy. Though there is no express corroboration from other texts for Suparņa's being involved in a mess in the search for the kine, the important fact that Sarama secured ' food ' for her offspring - shall we say for mankind itself - has been borne out. According to RV 1 • 72 • 8, it may be said that this pact of Sarama secured the Translation - 438.1 Now the Asuras called Paņis were the cowherds of the gods. They made away with them. At the Rasa they penned them up and hid them in a cave. 2 The gods, exceedingly wroth, said : 44 O Eagle, search after these our cows." 44 Yes." He flew after them. 3 He came upon them hidden in a cave at the Rasā. Before him, when he had come, they placed this, viz. liquid butter, milk, clotted curds, sour curds. He was well sated with this. They said to him : " O Eagle, this shall be thy tribute, this food, do not betray us." 4 He flew away again. They (the gods) said to him : 44 O Eagle, hast thou found our cows ? " 44 What news is there about the cows ? " he said. 5 " This news," said Indra, compressing the eagle's crop. " I for one am the mouth (to declare that) thou hast stayed among the cows." He (the eagle) threw up a drop of sour curds or some clotted curds. That same became the camphor-plant which grows here in spring. 6 Indra thus cursed him (the eagle) : 44 May thy sustenance be of bad origin, who, having found our cows, has not informed us." Thus his sustenance is the worst that is (found) in the rear of a village. 439.1 They said to Sarama : " O Sarama, do thou search after these our cows." " Yes." She set out for them. She came to the Rasā. 2 She said to her : "I shall swim theee (unless) thou wilt become fordable for me." 44 Swim me," she (the Rasā) said, 44 I shall not become ford- able for thee." 3 She (Saramā) laying back her ears came forward in order to swim her. She (Rasā) considered : 44 How indeed should a bitch swim me ? Come, I will be fordable for her." She (Rasā) said to her (Saramā) : " Do not swim me, I will be fordable for thee." 44 Yes." There was a ford for her. By means of the ford, she crossed over. 4 She came upon them (the cows) hidden within a cave at the Rasā. Before her when she had come, they placed, just as (they had done) before, this, viz., liquid butter, milk, clotted curds, sour curds. 5 She said : 44 1 am not so unfriendly to the gods. I have found what I may obtain of you. You, verily, have stolen from the gods. Truly of these cows I am the guide. You shall not make me prate, you shall not keep Indra's cows." (The text is a bit unintelligible here, however, the translator pro- ceeds - ). She... prevailed. The outer membrane of the waters- that she found. That she split open. One cried out against her : 44 As if she were to kill that one, Saramā splits open the outer-membrane." Even now there is this reproach : 44 As if she were to kill that one, Saramā splits open the outer-membrane." For she did split open that outer-membrane. 7 She came back again. They (the gods) asked her : 44 O Saramā, hast thou found the cows ? " 440.1 44 1 have found them," she said, 44 hidden within a cave at the Rasā. Be pleased to take them just as you thought." 2 Indra said to her : 44 Food-eating, wench, I make thy off- spring, O Saramā, who hast found our cows." And indeed among the Vidarbhans the mācalas, descendants of Saramā, kill even tigers. 3 These gods prepared this Abhiplava-ceremony. By means of it they sailed over. That is the etymology of the term Abhiplava." 6. Commenting on RV 1.62.3, Säyana says : 44 atredamäkhyänam. Saramā nāma devašunī. Paņibhir gosvapahrtāsu tadgavesaņāya tām Saramām Indrah prāhaisīt. Yathä loke vyädho vanāntargatamrgānvesaņāya svānam visrjati tad vat. Šā ca Saramā evamavocat 44 He, Indra, asmadîyâya sišave tadgosambandhi ksïrâdyannam y adi prayacchasi tarhi gamisyâmi.

Tathā niveditāsu gosu tamasuram hatvā tā gāh sa Indro' labhateti. Ayam artho'syâm pratipâdyate." Oertel finds fault with Säyana for not giving the full story while introudcing RV 10.108, where, it is clear that Sāyaņa only expands the sentence quoted from the Sarvānukramaņl. It may, however, be noted in passing that among about half a dozen contexts where Saramā and her adventure are stated in the RV, Säyana, almost without design, has given short or long</page><page sequence="28">150 H- L- hariyappa milk-food to the whole of mankind (mânusï vit bhojate), RV 4*16-8- and Sâyana thereon adds support for this view.7 Now it will be of interest to study the legend in detail. I RGVEDA SAMHITĀ Following are the passages in the Rgveda which mention Saramā; an attempt will be made to construct a story of her exploits without departing from the original text. 1. índrasya'ngirasam cestau vidát Sarámâ tánayãya dhāsim / Brhaspátir bhinád ádrim vidád gáfr sámusríyãbhir vāvašanta nāraķ // (RV 1*62 *3) Translation - " By command of Indra and the Añgirasas, Saramā found sustenance for posterity. The Lord of the Gods ( Brhaspati ) split the rock8 and found the cattle; the heroes shouted merrily in company with the cows." Sâyana introduces the verse as follows - Concerning this there is the following story (ãkhyãna). There was the heaven- ly dog called Saramā. When the cows had been driven off by the Paņis, Indra sent Saramā in search of these cows, even as in this world a hunter would send forth his dog in search of game. Saramā said, " O Indra, I will go on one condition, that you will give to our offspring the food belonging to these cows, viz. milk etc." He said : 44 Yes." And so the Šātyāyanaka says : 44 Food-eating I make thine offspring, O Saramā, who hast found our cows." Then going she learnt about the abode of the cows. And having learnt it, she told him. And having been informed about the cows, Indra, slaying the demon, regained these cows.9 2. Svâdhyo divá ā saptá yahvî'b. râyó důro vyrtajñá ajānan / vidád gávyam Sarámâ drlhám ürvám yénâ nú kam mānusī10 bhójate vít // (RV 1-72*8) introductions with slight inconsistencies. He could not have missed the difference in the outline of the legend really. One wonders if this adds support to the theory that Sâyana alone did not write the Bhâsya but caused many scholars to do so by parts, under his general editorship. Cf. Gune, Säyana's Commentary - its Composition. AŠ. Mookerjee 3.3. Also my paper on the Rgvedic word Parvata, contributed to Prof. M. Hiriyanna Commermora- tion Volume (Pub. Kävyälaya, Mysore), wherein I have argued in favour of the same conclusion. 7. sá no netā vājam ādarsi bhūrim. Sâyana - no'smān bhūrim prabhūtam vājam annam netā prâpayitâ sa tvam ā darsi, ādaram krtavān asi. 8. adrim attāram asuram (Sâyana) meaning the demon Pani or Vala as he is sometimes thought. 9. The text is quoted above, footnote 6.</page><page sequence="29">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 151 Translation - Seven rivers, mighty and beneficent, from heaven (flow on earth), and (thereby) the knowers of Truth perceived the doors of wealth. Sarama found the kine and also plenty of food, by which, indeed, mankind enjoys (sustenance for ever). It must be noted that this mantra is addressed to Agni. Though he is not directly connected with the recovery of the heavenly cows, the poet means to express that whatever good there has been, all that has happened by Agni's favour. The seven mighty rivers flow from heaven. They are flooded with water, which is showered on Earth by the Sun-god. And how is the Sun-god pleased ? Through Agni, of course, who carries him the oblations with which the god is pleased. Even so, the release of the cattle. Having been pleased with the sacrifice, which is possible only through his favour, Indra sent Sarama in search of the cows, and in return she secured abundant food wherewith mankind is able to sustain. Secondly, the stanza records two different ideas viz. the Vedic people as they progressed in their march finding seven huge rivers, and Sarama discovering the stolen cows. The one opened the very door of prosperity, by providing for agri- culture etc., the other provided eternal food, namely cows' milk. 3. Vidád yádi Sarámã rugnám ádrela máhi pāthaķ pürvyám sadhryak kaķ / Ágram nayat supády āksarāņām ácchã rávam prathamā jānatī gāt /-/ (RV 3* 31 -6) Translation - When Sarama discovered the fated (entrance) to the mountain, then Indra made great and ample provision (for her young), as previously promised. Then the sure-footed one, already familiar with their lowing, led (them : Indra and Aňgirasas) to the presence11 of the imperishable kine. This verse clearly implies the various stages of the story : cattle stolen and hidden in the mountainous stronghold, Sarama ordered to search and Indra's promise of food for her progeny, her success and the promise realised, Indra's final raid and recovery of cattle. 4. Apó yád ádrim puruhūta dárdalj Āvir bhuvat Sarámã pürvyám te / sá no netā vājam ā darsi bhūrim gotrā rujánn áftgirobhir grnãnáh // (RV 4.16.8) Translation - When you rent the clouds apart, for the sake of water, O Indra, there appeared Sarama before you (bringing news of the cattle). Then, as the 10. Sãyana - Yena nu yena tu gavyena mânusï vit manos sambandhinī prajā bhojate. Idānīm bhuñkte. (Tad gavyam api paramparayâ'gnir èva karoti). 11.

Velankar.</page><page sequence="30">152 H- L- HARIYAPPA Añgirasas extolled you, you, our leader, pierced through the mountains and, by providing us plenty of food, evinced great interest in us. Note . - apo yad adrim puruhūta dardafc - this must refer to a different incident, namely, the usual concern of Indra to send showers of rain to the Earth. Soon after this was performed, Sarama appeared with glad tidings of the discovery of the stolen cattle. So another adventure was ready for Indra, who, being greatly interested in the well-being of his followers, readily took up the task. The Añgirasas praised him all the while. Encouraged by their flattery, he vanquished the Paņis, recovered the cattle and provided plenty of food for mankind, as promised to Saramā earlier. 5. Ánünod átra hástayato ádrib ārcan yéna dáša masó návagvâfo / rtám yatí Sarámâ gā avindat visvāni satyâ 'ngirāš cakāra // (RV 5.45.7) Translation - At this sacrifice the stone (set in motion) by the hands of the priests began to make noise, whereby the nava-gvas celebrated the ten-month worship, when Saramā, traversing the path of truth, discovered the cattle, and Añgiras rendered all (the rite) effective. Note . - Sãyana, for the first time, introduces an alternative explanation of Saramā. She is the heavenly dog or Speech herself, uttering praise, and rtam is sacrifice or truth. (Rtam satyam yajñam vā yatï prāpnuvatī Saramā saraņasīlā stutirūpā vāk, angirasām gavārtham indreņa prahitā devasunī Vā gā avindat paņibhir apahrtāķ). Rtam means12 among other things the heavenly path, the established path as well. The hymn is addressed to the Visve-devas, the palm, having been given to the Añgirasas (who are seven in number), in the liberation of the heavenly cows. 6. Ví s ve asyâ vyúsi māhināyāb sám yád góbhir áñgiraso návanta / útsa āsām paramé sadhásthe rtásya pathā sarámâ vidad gāfr // (RV 5.45.8). Translation - When all the Añgirasas, on the advent of this adorable Dawn, came in contact with the (discovered) cattle, then milk and the rest were offered in the august assembly, for Saramā had found the cows by the path of truth. 12. Grassmann in his Wörterbuch zum Rig-Veda has given as many as 23 meanings in which the word Rta has been used in RV. Articles and monographs have appeared in plenty on this subject in recent times. A comprehensive study of Rta has been made by Dr. H. Lefever in his " Vedic Idea of Sin" (Ph.D. thesis, Tübingen) London Mission Press, Nagarcoil, Travancore (1935).</page><page sequence="31">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 158 Note . - Here, again, Sãyana takes Sarama as Speech or the heavenly dog, and rta as truth or water. (Rtasya satyasya pathā margena Sarama vāk devašunī vā gā nigūdhā vidat alabhata. Yadvã āsām gavām parame sadha- sthe sahasthāne vrajasya nigūhanapradeše utsa udakasya prasravaņo vartate, bilam ityarthafc. Tena rtasyodakasya pathā margena Sarama gā vidat). Again, the Višve-devas are the devatā here. There was general jubilation when the cattle were recovered, Añgirasas led the celebration, all drank milk etc. and made merry. The rsi is Sadāprņa of the Atri family, in this as well as in the previous quota- tion. 7. RV 10.108 1.

Verily the way is long and ' losing itself in the distance.' What is the motive of thy coming to us ? What sort of wandering was thine ? And how didst thou cross the waters of the Rasā ? 2. I come as the appointed messenger of Indra, desiring O Paņis, your great hidden treasures ; through fear of being crossed, the (water) helped us : thus I passed over the waters of the Rasā. 3. What is Indra like, O Saramā ? How is the look of him as whose messenger you have come to this place from afar ? Oh, let him come by all means, we will make friends with him, let him look after our cattle ! 4. I cannot think he is a person to be subdued, he is one to subdue (others) - he, as whose messenger, I have come here from afar. The deep streams conceal him not. Slain by Indra, O Paņis, you will lie prostrate. 5. These are the cows, O auspicious Saramā, which thou desirest, having traversed round and round the ends of heaven. Who will give them up to thee, without fight? And our weapons are sharp, indeed. 6. Your words, O Paņis, are no substitute for armies, your sinful bodies may not be pierced by arrows, your track may yet be unassailable for an invasion, but, mind you, the Lord of the Gods (Brhaspati) will spare neither. 7. This treasure, O Saramā, with its cows, horses and riches, is quite secure in the mountain stronghold. Good sentinels are the Paņis who guard it. Alas, in vain didst thou come to this far-off land !</page><page sequence="33">RGVÈDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGÈS ifâ 8. Roused by the Soma, the Rsis, Ayâsya, Añgirasas and the Navagvas will march against you here and this treasure of kine they will snatch and share ; then, O Paņis, you will eat these words of yours. 9. After all, O Sarama, thou hast come hither constrained by divine pressure. Return not, we shall make thee our sister and we shall set apart a share of cattle for thee, O good one. 10. Brotherhood or sisterhood, I know not; Indra knows and the fierce Añgirasas. Desirous of cattle they will besiege you as I get back to them ; hence, O Paņis, run away to a distant spot. 11. Make haste, O Paņis, to a far-off place, let the kine step forth in due order - the kine which had been hidden and which Brhaspati (Indra), Soma, the Rsis and the grinding stones have well earned. From the above abstracts it can be seen that the recovery of the stolen cows was a great event in the annals of the Vedic peoples. Being referred to by name in no less than five maņdalas and by five seers of different families, Sarama has shown herself to be an important character. The Añgirasas, a company of seven brothers, have staged the whole drama. Indra is of course the hero. Brhaspati is once mentioned, but he is Indra only, being the chief of Gods (brhatām patiti). But it is indeed the concern of all the gods : hence the hymns to Agni the priest of the Sacrifice and to the Visve-Devas. This suggests that for the common weal, the gods would put forth a united effort. Victory was theirs, as it ever came to be. The author (or the seer) of the hymn of the tenth mandala is anonymous, in the ordinary sense. Technically, the Paņis and Sarama are seers (rsi) of their own speeches and deities (devatā) of the speeches of the other party.14 (Panyuktau Sarama devi, taduktau Panayas tathā).15 The dialogue (Samvāda) is excellently conceived, and composed in a masterful manner. The Paņis are described as niggards, misers, traders or demons, henchmen of the Dasyu chief etc., etc. by the civilization-experts. This hymn belies such contemptible references. They are enemies of course, but they have behaved nobly, diplomatically and with the utmost courtesy for the messenger. Their utterances are marked by firmness and resolve; they won't surrender the treasure without a fight and their arms are strong enough. They have had the sense of humour to indulge in a light-hearted joke at their adversary, Indra. Especially that a female messenger led the mission, the ques- tions - ' How is Indra, how does he look like etc.' - provide amusement; they render the atmosphere more lively and perhaps easily convert the ambassador to thier own thinking. Lastly they tried to lure her with a share and argue speciously in support 4 We know you have after all come on this mission by pressure of the gods, why bother to return and it is such long distance, stay with us as sister and enjoy a share of the cattle.' Thus three of the well-known expedients - sama, dāna and bheda - were called in to play. The Paņis behaved indeed magnanimously, for, were they demons and barbarians, what harm if they had resorted to the final expedient, daņda, also ? For the occasion at least, the enemy could have been put Bull DCRI xi-ll</page><page sequence="34">156 H. L.

L. HAR1YAPPA II SAMHITĀS OTHER THAN THE RGVEDA 1. The Vâjasaneyi Samhitā repeats RV 111.31 .6 Vidadyadî Sarama etc. (VS 33.59), the repetition does not hear any relevancy to the context.16 2ģ The Kāthaka17 repeats the same mantra i.e. RV 3.31.6 with a background which is of doubtful cogency. Gods and demons vied with each other in sacrifice. Whatever gods did demons also did and became more prosperous. The gods became inferior and much degraded. Then they saw the 4 Āgrāyaņa ' rite and overtook their rivals. In this rite they first employed the mantra Vidadyadl Sarama (RV 3.31.6) as 4 puro-ruc.' In the redemption of the heavenly cows, Sarama went forth first and the task was accomplished, perhaps this 4 going ahead ' was sufficient to justify the employment of the Rgvedic verse in the 4 Go-ahead ' rite (ãgrãyana). And to boot there is the word agram in the mantra ! 3. The Maitrãyam Samhitā also repeats18 the same mantra i.e. RV 3.31.6 (Vidadyadl Saramā etc.). Here also the setting is the 44 Ãgrãyana," the mantra is again employed as 4 puro-ruc.' Having performed the Ãgrãyana, the gods went up to heaven and ousted the demons. The explanation of 4 puro-ruc ' is rather interesting. Says the text after quoting RV 3.31.6. Iti puro ruçam kuryãt, ru jati haiva, atho Vāg vai Saramā, vācam evaisām vrñkte. 4. The Atharva-veda Samhitā has two verses referring to Saramā (AV 9.4.16 and 20.77.8). Of these the latter reference is a repetition of RV 4.16.8. The former is as follows : Té kústhikâfcL Sarámâyai kürmébhyo adadhufr saphān / úbadhyamasya kïtébhyab šva (ša) Vartébhyo adhârayan // Translation - 4 Those dew-claws (were) Saramā's, they assigned the hoofs to the tortoises, the content of his bowels they maintained for the worms, the ŠaVartas '. - Whitney (HOS). This hymn of the AV is to accompany the gift of a bull and is counted among the paustika mantras. It does not contribute anything for our understanding of the Saramā problem. She must however have been looked upon as the deity of the dogs. 16. Mahïdhara comments upon this, giving both interpretations i.e. Saramā as heavenly dog and Saramā as Speech. IT.

In fact the first eight verses of the RV hymn are repeated as AV 20.77, though the former has 21 stanzas in all. Indra is the deity praised throughout, the viniyoga being in connection with the prsthya and other sacrifices. The reference to Sarama, therefore, has the same value as its original counterpart.19 It may be said that the other Samhita texts contain no reference to Sarama. That she was an entity to reckon with in the Vedic fold seems more than established, though already speculation was afoot whether she was Indra's dog or whether she represented that most covetable attribute of a human being, viz. Speech. Ill BRĀHMAŅAS (A) 1. Taittiriya Brāhmaņa : (2. 5. 8.

There she saw the people starving for want of food. Then she created plenty of water, which is the preliminary aid for food and which flowed through all fields. Sure footed, she led forth water and then in front she knowing the lowing sound of the imperishable ones (cows) proceeded towards them. 19. In the words of Whitney (Atharvaveda HOS 7.cxli) Book 20 is a pure mass of excerpts from the RV, it stands in no conceivable relation to the rest of the AV, and when and why it was added thereto is a matter for conjecture. 20.

H ARI YAPP A Sarama found the herd of kine which was strong and huge, by the help of which the whole mankind is provided with milk etc. And all (the sacrificers) performed their duty and prepared the way for attaining heaven. These Brāhmaņa portions are concerned with mantras for what are described as upahomas.25 The commentary is by Sâyana as stated. But the interpretation is so different from that given in the RV for the same passage. This strengthens the view that commentaries attributed to the great name of Sâyana do not appear to be by a single hand. Under his able sponsorship a number of scholars must have independently ix. without co-ordination worked out different sections at one time. No further light is thrown on the original Saramā story except the fact that the tradition that Saramā by her timely service to Indra was able to secure food for mankind has been corroborated. That she found the (stolen) cows is also established. The relevancy of the contents of these mantras to the occasion prescribed is altogether a different problem. 2. The Apastamba Šrauta Sūtra (12.15.6) simply repeats the reading of the TB, only the first half corresponding to RV 3.31.6 and has nothing to add. 3. The version of the Jaiminiya Brāhmaņa and the Šā$yāyanaka, which is available only in quotations26 in other works, has been recorded above. (Supra fn. 5). There are a few minor variations from the accepted version of the story e.g. the Paņis are introduced as the cowherds of the gods ; they made away with the cattle in their charge. 4. Taittiriya Aranyaka27 - Sahasravrd iyam bhūmib / param vyoma sahasravrt / Asvinā Bhujyû Näsatyä / visvasya jagataspatī / jāyā bhūmib patir vyoma / mithunam tā aturyathâU / putro brhaspatï rudrab / Saramā iti stri pumām / sukram vāmantad raj atam vâmanyat / visurūpe ahanï dyauriva sthab // Commentary - Saramā vedih, sarab saraņam anusthānapravrttib sā ca mïyate paricchidyate atreti Saramā sā ca tayor duhitā / ' Iti ' evam strīpumam ekā stri d vau pumāmsau iti apatyatrayam sampannam. Here we have a third equation of Saramā.28 She is the sacred altar (vedi) and, if her holy origin were to be stated, she is the daughter of Heaven and Earth (Dyâvâprthivï). Brhaspati and Rudra - a peculiar combination - are also their sons "and hence Saramā is their sister.

One thing can be marked that the canine nature of Saramā has come to recede from the thought of the people. (B) Later Vedic references - Sarama does not seem to have contributed to Upanisadic thought. Her mundane appeal however has kept up in rather an amusing way, as reflected in the Pāraskara Grhya sūtra.29 After the medhāj anana ceremony certain spells are pronounced to guard the confinement chamber : Yadi kumāra upadravej j alena pracchãdyottariyena vã pitānka ãdhãya japati - kūrkurafr sukūrkurah kūrkuro bālabandhanak / Ceccecchunaka srja ñamaste astu Sìsaro lapetāpahvara / Tat satyam yat te devā varam adadulj sa tvam kumāram eva vāvrņithāb / Ceccecchunaka srja ñamaste astu Sisaro lapetāpahvara / Tat satyam yat te Saramā mātā Sisara^ pitā Šyāmašabalau bhrātarau / Ceccecchunaka srja ñamaste astu Sisaro lape tāpah vare ti. If, after birth, the child takes ill, the father takes the child on his lap, wraps it up warmly and recites the Dog-spell if it may be so termed. It is an invocation to the dog not to bother the child. For when the gods offered him a boon, it seems he chose the children for himself, that is, he will possess them, causing illness and perhaps death. The idea corresponds to what is generally described as bālagraha (bālabandhana), which is referred to in the Mahābhārata. Thus in the spell the father pleads with the creature to leave the child : ' Verily your mother is (the celebrated) Saramā, your father Sisara and, Šyāma and Šabala (the famous hounds of Yama) are your brothers. Therefore, doggie, let go, saluta- tion to thee, Sisara may speak, depart'. This is a sentiment and an appeal to the unknown spirit to get away from the child etc. - an appeal which we unconsciously say while appeasing the crying child. A similar reference is found in the Ekāgni-kāņda (2.16) which is also in the form of a spell to drive away the Dog-Spirit (šva-graha) i.e. to ward off whooping cough etc. which generally attack the children. Here the pedigree is differently given, fresh names are introduced, Alaba, Rji, Adhorāma, Ulumbala, Subirņa, etc. Syâma and Šabala are there of course, Saramā the mother but Lohita the father. But there is an interesting allusion to Saramā's spying the cattle while the boon is granted to the dog to pester children. ' True it is, Indra told thee to spy and bring the cows. Thou spied them and came back. He asked thee : 4 Hast thou spied?" Thou saidst : 4 Spied." (Indra then said) "Ask for a boon." (Thou saidst, " I select kumāra " etc.30 29. PGS 1,16.24. cf. Mbh. Äranyaka-parva (manuysyagrahas), cf. Keith, RPV p. 241. Also Hopkins. CHI, p.231. Hopkins thinks that the dog in the RV is the companion and ally of man, the protector and probably the inmate of his house. He also takes a strong exception to Brunn- hofens theory that in the eyes of the Vedic Aryans, the dog was a despicable beast. Amj Ph. V pp. 154-55. 30.

Saramā got the name by her quick movement (saraņāt). Thus Yâska is prepared to credit the story of Saramā as if the event did take place : the demons stole the divine cows, Indra ordered Saramā to search, she found them with the Paņis and had conversation with them, Indra recovered the cattle. The sacrificial equation of Saramā with Vak or Vedi was perhaps not recognised by him, though, as an etymologist, such explanations should usually catch his fancy. But Durgâcârya, his commentator, would not leave it at that. He is interested in the student knowing the other aspect of things as well. He writes - Saramā devašunītyaitihāsikapakseņa / Mädhyamikä vāk Nairuktapa- kseņa / Sā kasmāt / Saraņāt gamanāt / Durgâcârya writes in the most felicitous style and that will be sufficient excuse to quote him in extenso - Devapanayab kila devagavïr apajahruh / tataķ kilendrastadanvesanâya tadâlayam Saramām prāhiņot / Te cã devapanayastâm drstvā papracchur anayarcâ kim icchantiti / īdam asmannivāsasthānam Saramā kim icchantï kim asmattafr prârthayantï prānat prāptavatī kadācid apyanâgatapûrveti / api ca dūre hyadhvâ / mahadetad adhvānam na yadrcchayâ šakyam āgantum / Ya èva jagurib syãt bhršam gantā sa èva sakta āgantum / Parācaife parāncanairacitaļL parānmukhair añcanair gamanãir acito gataķ viprakrsto devanivāsāt / yato brūmah / He Sarame kāsmehitik kā tava asmāsvarthahitib arthasyâdhânàm / kö 'smatto 'rthas tava präptavyo'bhipreta āsīt yenäyam atimahānadhvā vyavasita āgantum / api ca kā paritakmyãsit / kim paritakanam / api nāma sukhā rātrir anantarā tavāsīt / paritakmyâ rātrifr / takmetyusnanäma takater gatyarthasya / sarvato hi tadgatam bhavati / tadenām ubhayatat parigrhya vartata iti paritakmyä rātrilj / api ca / katham Rasäyä atarafr payämsi / Rasā nāma nadf adhyardhayojanavistârã / tasyâb payāmsyatidustarāņi katham atarafr katham tïrnavatyasi / athavā / 31« Nirukta Ed- R.

The samanvaya is hard to understand. Writing in an age when Vedic knowledge was handed down by tradition, both in text and content, Durgâcârya has indeed presented a traditional interpretation. For, much of the Vedic cult was pursuit of the intellect rather than of common practice. Singnificant also is the fact that the Vāk-identity of Saramā is sponsored by the Yajus-samhitãs (KS, MS, VS). This is definitely expressed by Mahidhara32 commentator of Vajasaneyi Samhitā while explaining 33.59 which is a repetition of RV 3.31.6 as above indicated. Having commented on the mantra first as interpreted by the sacrifice he says : Evam adhiyajñam mantro vyäkhyätab / Bahvrcānām tu samvādasūktam idam." And a fresh derivation of the name Saramā is also sug- gested : " Saha ramante devā viprā vā yasyäm sā Saramā vāk". On the whole it should be repeated that the superimposition of the Vāk-identity fails to go home. Coming after Durga and Sâyana, Mahidhara has faithfully rendered the Yajus- tradition.

These carried off the cows of Indra and hid them away carefully. 25. Brhaspati saw (it was) thus, and having seen it he reported it to Indra. Then the Chastiser of Pāka (Indra) dispatched Saramā thither on a message. 26. In the (hymn) " what ? " (Kim 10.108) the Paņi demons interrogated her with the uneven stanzas, (saying) " Whence (do you come) ? To whom do you belong, fair one ? Or what is your business here ? " 27. Then Saramā addressed them : "I wander about as the messenger of Indra, seeking you and (your) stall and the kine of Indra who is asking for them. 28. On learning that she was the messenger of Indra, the wicked demons said : " Do not depart, Saramā, be our sister here. 29. Let us divide our share of the cows, be not unfriendly (ahitā) henceforth again." And with the last stanza of this hymn (10.108.11), as well as the even ones throughout, 30. She said, " I do not desire either sisterhood (with you) or (your) wealth* but I should like to drink the milk of those cows which you are hiding there." 31. The demons saying " Yes " to her, then brought her the milk. She having from natural taste and greed, drunk the demons' milk - 32. excellent, charming, delightful, stimulating strength - then again crossed the Rasā which extended a hundred leagues, 36. Some of the lines irresistibly remind one of the Rãmãyana style. It may be phantasy to jump on identities or postulate the lend-and-borrow theory : but pray, the phrase 4 Satayo- janavistãrãm ' by its sense and setting suggests Hanuman's flight over the 100-league-ocean. (Rãmãyana: Sundarakāņda - Canto 1). Oertel draws attention (JAOS 19, 2nd half, p. 99 fn.) to the fact that H. Jacobi compares the finding of Sītā by Hanumat to Saramā's search for the cows (Das Rãmãyana, 1893, p. 133). 37. In the notes Macdonell draws attention to Oldenberg's remarks in ZDMG 1898, p. 414 f. The remarks happen to be from the pen of Böhtlingk. Just a slip of the pen, repeated in the note on stanza 30.</page><page sequence="46">168 H. L. H ARI YAPP A 83. On the farther bank of which was their impregnable stronghold. And Indra asked Sarama, "You have seen the cows, I hope ? " 34. But she under the influence of the demons replied " no " to Indra. He, enraged, struck her with his foot. She then, vomiting the milk, 35. went trembling with fear, back again to the Paņis. The Lord of bay steeds (Indra) on his car, by the track which followed her steps, 36. went and smote the Paņis and brought back the cows. It must be conceded at the outset that this narrative, short and sweet, is complete in itself. It leaves no doubt in the mind of the listener as the threads are quite clear. The Paņis stole Indra's cows. Brhaspati made the ' first informa- tion report ' to Indra whereupon the latter set Sarama on the investigation. She was quite successful, but, alas, poor thing, she allowed herself to be enticed by the enemy. But let us see : In stanza 30, she clearly rejects the offer of a bribe from the demons and refuses to recognise any sisterhood with them. On second thoughts however, she asked for the milk of those cows which they were hiding there. The demons thought that she had come round or, at least, that she became vulnerable. They said 6 yes ' and brought the milk. But it was āsuram payab, apparently cultured with witchcraft, had its effect surely upon the victim and mark we, there- fore, the description of the milk in the next stanza (32. param, samvananam, hrdyam, balapustikaram - excellent, charming, delightful, stimulating strength) which attributes warrant us to think that the milk was enchanted and certainly was not the milk of Indra's cows. But how did Sarama, who handled the case so far with such deftness, suddenly grow so stupid as to spread a trap for herself? She perhaps thought that, by claiming the milk of those cows i.e. Indra's cows and by getting it, she would, in a way, get assured of the surrender of the cows : a kind of earnest-money as it were. But she miserably failed and was outwitted.38 So it is just possible to exonerate her from the charge of accepting a bribe, for, only in the elation of her success, she tripped and got caught in her own net. It is, at any rate, discreet to observe that the Rgvedic hymn 10.108 closes with the final speech of Sarama which administers a warning to the enemies. The sequel is left to fancy. The fact of Saramā's treachery is not borne out by corroborative evidence, as her faithful service has been, for instance, by the JB and the Šātyā- yanaka. RV 3.31.6° - agram nayat supadi - must set all suspicion against her at rest. She led forth, fleet-footed that she was, which is a high compliment for her rôle in the whole episode, pronounced by no less a Vedic Authority than Višvāmitra. 38. The situation reminds one of Hanumān's reflections on the duties and responsibilities of a messenger, e.g. Ghätayanti hi kãryãni dūtāh pandita-mãninah. Rãmãyana, (Sundara 2.38).

But one word is significant that Saramā, unwilling (anicchantī) to accept their offer of friendship, repudiated them. This stresses the fact that the reflection brought on her character according to the Brhaddevatā is to be discounted. By the time that Sadgurušisya writes, it can be noticed that even the broad outlines have been tampered with. The Aiigirasas are completely out of the picture. The cows belong to Brhaspati specifically and he is designated as Indra's priest (Indra-purohita). Paņis are slaves who are at the beck and call of the demon Bala, hence the stolen cows were hidden in Bala's city. Saramā is the dog of heaven but goddess belonging to the canine species, helpful to Indra in the sport of hunting etc. (svajātīyām devatām, mrgayâdisv Indrasya sādhana- bhūtām). It seems incongruous however that, if the demon Bala was the overlord, if the cows were stolen by the Paņis evidently at the behest of their chieftain, and, further, if the booty was hidden in Bala's capital, Indra's messenger Saramā should have talks with the servants, the Paņis, and, that the Paņis could speak so author- itatively and even offer terms on the spot.

The clear lines of the original, owing to addition and expansion, have already become hazy in the imagination of poster- ity and inconsistency in detail here and there should not matter for a credulous folk ! VII SÃYANA Sãyana in his Vedārtha-prakāša (commentary on RV-Samhitā) :41 (A) Following are the contexts where Saramā's name is mentioned as well as the incident of the recovery of the stolen cows. (1) 1.62.3 The text of Sâyaria's prefatory remarks on this mantra with its argument as well, is quoted above (see supra fn. 9). (2) 1.72.8 In the course of the comment, Sãyana says - 4 Tvatsãdhyena yagena prita Indro gavām anvesanãya Saramām nāma deva- áunim presitavān / Sā ca Sarainā gavām sthānam avagatyendrasya nyavedayat / Indras ca tān añgiraso gāh prâpayat / Ata etat sarvam tvam èva krtavān'/ The Rk is in praise of Agni. (3) 3.31.6 The story background of this verse is supplied by Sãyana while explaining the previous verse which also alludes to the event : It runs as follows : Purā kilāiigirasām gāvafr Paņināmakair asurair apahrtya nigūdhe kasmi- mscit parvate sthāpitāb. / Te cāngirasas tatprâptyartham Indrām tustuvuk / Stutaš ca sa Indro gavânvesaiiâya Devasunim prāhiņot / Sāca gavām gavesaiia- parā satī tat sthānam alabhata / Tayā vijnāpita Indras tā gāh āniyā'ngiro- bhyak prādād ityaitihâsikï kathā / The affair of the heavenly cows is directly or indirectly suggested in the preced- ing and succeeding verses viz . 3.31.5 and 7. As certain problems arise out of a perusal of these three verses it is better to consider them together. Prof. H. D. Velankar translates them as follows:42 3.31.5. The wise (Añgirasas) dug out (a path reaching) upto (the cows) dwelling in the strong (fortress of Vala), the seven priests urged themselves forward with a bold (prācā) spirit. They discovered all the paths of Rta. Knowing these, Indra entered (the cave of Vala) with respect (for the Añgirasas). 41.

When Sarama found out the fissure in the rocky cave (of Vala), she at the same time found out (sadhryak kah) the great and ancient food (or protection i.e. the cows) thereby. The light-footed Sarama led (herself or Indra and Añgirasas) into the presence (agram) of the never-perishing' (cows). As she well recognised it, she was the first to go in the direction of their bellowing. 3.31.7. The great poet (i.e. the leader of the Añgirasas) went (to the mountain) seeking its friendship, and the mountain did sweeten its contents for the pious man {i.e. kept the cows ready for delivery). The brave god, fighting along with his youthful friends (Maruts) did win (the cows), and then immediately did Añgiras begin to sing.43 It is clear that the fifth stanza above refers to the recovery of the cows after attacking the enemy's stronghold. This feat was chiefly the work of the Seven Priests who are generally identified with the Añgirasas. Indra acknowledges their service with respect. Saramā is nowhere in the picture ! The next verse (6) also relates the adventure of redeeming the heavenly cows. But Saramā figures prominently.44 She led herself or, Indra and the Añgirasas, to the presence of the imperishable kine. The seventh stanza contemplates quite another picture : the leader of the Añgirasas went to the mountain seeking friendship, the mountain did sweeten its contents (asūdayat44a garbham) for the pious man (i.e. kept the cows ready for delivery). If so, no fight at all, the object is gained. But the text continues to say the brave god, fighting along with his youthful friends (the Maruts) did win (the cows), and then immediately did Añgiras begin to sing. This confuses a bit : if the mountain, in deference to the pious man was willing to surrender the cows, there should be no work for the brave god and the friends. In all the exploits of Indra, clearing a cloud or rending a rock asunder is a feature ; without this feat, did the fight take place at all, is the question. It seems to me that the seventh stanza is a sequel to the 6th, the sequence is logical : Saramā led the way, Indra, always desiring (or working for) friends, followed. And lo, - perhaps Saramā's threat to the Paņis (RV 10.108) had effect- 43. The text of the above verses is as follows : 5. Vilaú satir abhí dhīrā atrndan prācāhinvan mánasã saptá viprāh / Visvām avindan pathyâmjtásya prajãnánn it tā námasã viveša // 6.

L. H ARI YAPP A the mountain had kept its contents (the cows) ready to be handed over. Meanwhile the Maruts (the leader with his young group) joined the chief, and Añgiras imme- diately offered compliments to their Lord. The translation may be restated as follows : 45 And verily, the Most Wise went after, he who always desires friends for himself, the mountain surrendered its contents to him of great deeds. The chief of the Maruts (maryak) with his youthful group joined in order to felicitate him. And Añgiras promptly set himself to praise. If it be granted, then, that the sixth and the seventh stanzas are composite, could we reconsider the explanation of the 5th stanza ? As already stated, the part played by the Aňgirasas is stressed there, that, in fact, they did the whole thing, dug an (underground) path to the mountain cave etc. and that Indra had only to go and bring the cows. Sarama is not wanted at all. Let us now consider the other references in RV itself. RV I 62.3 definitely says " Indrasyãngirasãm cestau vidat Sarama tanayâya dhāsim " - Sarama obtained food for progeny on the occasion of her deputation by the desire of Indra and Aňgirasas.46 RY 5.45.7 emphasises the same when, it says " Rtam yatī Saramā gā avindad visvāni saty- āngirāš cakãra " - Saramā by adopting the path of Truth discovered the cows, and Añgiras made good the promise to the entire world. Both Saramā and the Aňgirasas are extolled here. And finally RV 10.108 must convince all about Sarama's mission to the Paņis as Indra's Messenger (Indrasya dūtīti). Thus Saramā's rôle in the whole affair is remarkable. Having regard to this background we shall read 3.31.5 again : Vīļaii satir abhl dhfrā atrndan prācāhinvan mánasâ saptá viprāķ / Vlsvām aviridan pathyâm rtásya prajãnánn it tā námasâ viveša // 45. With the following notes - (a) Vipratamah - atisayena medhāvī - Sāyaņa. (b) Sakhîyan (añgirobhis saha) sakhitvamātmana icchan. Taken to qualify vipratamah, not adrih. Because Indra always worked for the good of the gods, desirous to endear himself to them. Èvery account of this story says that either Añgiras or Brhaspati urges upon Indra to take action. He took, only to oblige them. Thus sakhîyan more appropriately refers to Indra's desire for friendship at home with Añgiras and others rather than with the mountain. (c) It is not an unreasonable happening if, as a result of Saramā's warning, the Paņis » evasive as they were, prone to harass rather than fight a pitched battle, left the cows in the moun- tain cave and ran away. The impression is that the Paņis and other tribesmen were a constant menace to the gods' smooth living. So why should they run the risk of being once for all destroyed by facing Indra on the battlefield ? (&lt; d ) cf. Monier-Williams : Sanskrit-English Dictionary under marya. (e) makhasyan=makhitum icchan. According to Dhātupātha, (132-159) makha makhi ņakha ņakhi etc. are all gatyarthas i.e. meaning to go. cf. Monier-Williams under makha, the root means to worship, makha adj. Ved. 44 active, lively, sprightly, cheerful, free (said of the Maruts etc.)." makhasyan may therefore mean desiring to worship, hence, felicitate. 46. Sãyana. Indrasya Añgirasam rsīņām ca istau preraņe sati.</page><page sequence="51">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES I73 It may be translated thus : The strong-minded Seven Priests troubled themselves (atrndan)47 much with regard to (abhi) (the cows) pent up (satih) in the stronghold (vllau) : they propitiat- ed with devout (prācā) praise for Indra, and they found the eternal (visvām) (Sarama) who was! following the Path of Truth. Knowing all these (acts), (Indra) came in full deference (to the priests). To conclude, one is impressed, that RV 3.31.5, 6 and 7 may be said to constitute a connected narrative of Indra's recovery of the stolen cows. The Seven Priests, noticing the fact that the cattle had been lifted, set themselves busy regarding their recovery. They praised and propitiated Indra. Then they secured the co-operation of Saramā. Indra heard their prayer and came upon the scene. Indra and the Seven Priests deputed Saramā to reconnoitre. She succeeded and led Indra and the Añgirasas to the presence of the cows. The Maruts also rushed to the spot, evidently to support their chief. It was a pleasant surprise however to see that the cows were ready to be led back to heaven, for, apparently, the Paņis had fled. The Maruts offered their respectful felicitations and the Añgirasas showered compliments on the glorious Indra. (4) RV 4.16.8 seems to allude to more than one event as already remarked, hence Sâyana' s allusion to the Saramā episode is but casual. Commenting on the 2nd line of the verse, he says : (āvir bhuvat Sarámâ pürvyám te) Saramā devas uni pürvyám purā te tubhyam Paņibhir apahrtam godhanam āvir bhuvat prakāsayāniāsa / We must also mark that the Añgirasas, all the while, praised Indra (añgirobhir grņānab). (5-6) RV 5.45.7, 8 Sâyana has alluded to the story very briefly here and there in the whole hymn. What he has said specifically under verses seven and eight has been quoted and 47. utrdir himsânâdarayoh says the Dhātupātha (1539) trd VII P. = to trouble, kill, destroy etc., also to disregard. Sâyana says upeksām akurvan«= neglected, which interpretation is to do discredit to the Seven Priests who are described as dhīrāh. After the cattle were lifted, the Seven Priests took great trouble with regard to their search and recovery, is the simple idea. What did they do ? First, as anybody would do in distress, they poured forth prayer to God i.e. Indra - prācā manasā ahinvan - Sâyana - prakarseņa Indrām ancatīti prāk / tenendravisayena manasā / manyata iti manah stotram / Tena stotreņāhinvan avardhayan Indrām tustam akurvan (hivi, divi, dhivi, jivi prīņanārthāh - Dhātupātha 630 ff). Secondly, visvām rtasya pathyäm avindan (i.e. visvasambandhinīm visvāsām prajānām indrānugraheņa annam sampâdayitrîm ata èva mātrnirvisesām Rtasya satyasya pathyäm pathi bhavām Saramām devīm avindan alabhanta ityartho'nasüyayä vicäryatäm sahrdayaih tatrabhavadbhih. Saramäyä devyā mātrnirvisesatā nigamenaivābhipretā iti me manīsā/ tad atrāvadhāryatām - RV 5.45.6 ápa yā māta rnutá vrajám góh / ) they found the goddess (Saramā), the eternal or universal, she having found support or sustenance for the whole universe. She being one of the deities of heaven indeed followed the path of Rta, established order. All the gods belonged to a hege- mony which had certain Laws which would be adhered to by the members in the interests of the general weal. Here was the good Sarama, light-footed, whose services, the Añgirasas proposed to be utilised. Prajānan it tā / tā tänyangirasäm karmāņi prajānan it prakarseņa jānan Indrah - Sâyana. Indra having recognised all these preliminary efforts on the part of the Seven Priests, came forward (entered upon the scene : ā vivesa) to do his part of the duty.</page><page sequence="52">174 H. L. HARIYAPPA considered above. Commenting on the first stanza of the hymn he says - " atra añgirasam paņibhir apahrtya girer adhati sthāpitānām gavām Indreņa vimokab. pratipâdyate." The cows are here represented as belonging to Añgirasas them- selves. Secondly, as already stated, the complex of construing Sarama as some- thing other than Sarama, a heavenly being, has been introduced for the first time. Here she is either herself or the embodiment of Speech. (7) RV 10.108 Introducing this fine hymn, which records a talk (sam vada) between Sarama (Indra's messenger) on one part and the Paņis on the other, Sâyana says - Aindrapurohitasya Brhaspater gosu Valanâmno'surasya bhataib Paņināmakair asurair apahrtya guhãyãm nihitāsu satīsu Brhaspatipreritenendreņa gavām anvesanâya Sarama nānn devašunī presitā / Sā ca mahatim nadīm uttïrya Vala- puram prâpya guptasthāne nītās tā gā dadarša. Atha tasminn antare Panaya id am vrttāntam avagacchanta ēnām mitrīkartum samvādam akurvan. According to this the stolen cattle belonged to Brhaspati. As the text itself is silent as to whom definitely the cows belonged, to Indra, to Añgirasas or to Brhaspati or to the gods as a community, it will not be unreasonable to assume that the gods as a community possessed one stall and that Añgirasas and Brhaspati, the Maruts and other followers of Indra were concerned with its safety. Most references, however, point to the Añgirasas owning it. Brhaspati in the Rgvedic context is yet Indra (Brhatām patiti). The Maruts are always stated as Indra's allies. So the ownership question may be solved in favour of the Añgirasas. (B) In certain contexts where the recovery of the stolen cows is the topic though Saramā's name is not mentioned, Sâyana says : - (1) RV 1.6.5 Asti kiñcid upâkhyânam / Paņibhir devalokāt gāvo'pahrtā andhakāre niksiptāb / Tās cendro marudbhiti sahā jay aditi / Etaccānu- kramaņikāyām sūcitam - Paņibhir asurair nigūļhā gā anvestum Saramām devašunīm Indreņa prahitām ayugbhib Panayo mitrîyantah procuti / man- trāntare ca drstântatayâ sūcitam - niruddhā āpah Paņineva gāvati (RV 1.32.11) iti / Tadetad upakhyânam abhipretyocyate - (2) RV 1.32.11 Paņināmako'suro gā apahrtya bile sthâpayitvâ bila- dvāram âcchâdya yathâ niruddhavâmstathetyarthati / Here perhaps on account of the brevity of the introduction, Sâyana has not paid attention to accurate details. In the first citation above, he simply says : The demons called Paņis stole the cows and imprisoned them in darkness. Indra won them back with the help of the Maruts. Neither Saraniā nor the Añgirasas are mentioned. (3) RV 2.24.6 Introducing this stanza, Sâyana says: - Gosainùhe Paņibhir apahrte sati Paņīnām sthānam Saramakhy ayā devasunyâ jnātvā Brahmaņaspatinā srstā Añgirasati tat sthānam prâpya</page><page sequence="53">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES I75 gosamūham Paņibhir nirrnitā mäyäs ca drstvā asuranivāsasthānam svahastod- bhūtenāgninā dagdhvā pratyägacchan / Tadetat dvrcenocyate / When the Paņis stole the cows, the Añgirasas traced them with the help of Saramā and reduced them to ashes with fire produced by their own hands. For once Indra is not concerned in the whole adventure ! All the same Indra is the devatā of the verse and the hymn (first 12). VIII NITIMAÑJARI Nitimañjari (15th cent. a.D.) - Dya Dviveda, author of the Nitimañjari with his own commentary, postulates a few ethical maxims on the basis of the Saramā legend. 1. Tattvavid api samsāre mūdho bhavati lobhatah Tattvajña Saramãyâcad Indrām annam gavām grahe / Though knowing the Truth, a person out of greed in this earthly life, loses all sense of values ; Sarama, wTho knew the Truth, begged food from Indra on the occasion of redeeming the kine. 4 Saramā's knowledge of the Absolute is declared in " Godhā, Ghosā " etc. (BD 2.82-84). Even she, caught in this worldly illusion, asked Indra food for her progeny. Any ignorant man wrill exert to protect the cows, but Saramā, though full of divine knowledge, lost all sense by avarice. There is a story relating to it.48 The story is borrowed from Sāyaņa verbatim. Then RV 1.62.3 is quoted, as also BD 8.24-36 4 which described the event connected with RV 10. 108, '49 2.

One episode is however found in the Uttarakāņda54 of how Rāma meted out justice in favour of a Sãrameya (descendant of Sarama) against a dvi ja, who beat the former without reason. The two cantos that relate the story elaborately are shown in printed editions as inter- polations.

Beaten by Janamejaya's brothers, he crying aloud, ran to the mother. 2 The mother told him who was weeping - why do you weap ? By whom are you beaten ? 3 Thus said, he replied to his mother - I have been beaten by the brothers of Janamejaya. 4 The mother said to him again - Evidently you have been at fault, therefore you are beaten. 5 He replied her again - No, I have not wronged even a bit. I do not pry into the oblations nor do I lick them. 6 Hearing that, his mother Saramā very much moved by grief for her son went to that sacrifice where Janamejaya and his brothers were performing what is called Dīpa-satra (' Sacrifice for Light '). 7 The angry Saramā burst forth there - This my son has wronged you in no way. Why was he beaten ? Since he was beaten though innocent, an unknown calamity shall befall you. 8 Thus told by the heavenly dog Saramā, Janamejaya was very much frightened 0,nd was filled with remorse» 9 (3) Saramā is mentioned as one of several goddesses (devyafo) who were jnembers of Brahma's Court. 55.

This is in striking contrast with the Vedic idea that she was responsible in securing eternal food for mankind. XI VARÄHA PURÄNA The Varāha Purāņa relates the ' Saramopäkhyäna'. In the course of a conversa- tion between Varāha (the Boar incarnation of God Visņu) and Dharaņī (Mother Earth), the former narrates the story : Once as a result of Durvāsas's curse Indra was ousted from Heaven by Durjaya, son of Supratīka. With all other gods and followers, he settled on earth towards the east of Vārāņasī (Benares). In the meanwhile, Vidy ut and Suvidyut, two demons, practised severe penance and took possession of the overlordship of the world after Durjaya' s death, and raised a mighty army to overcome the gods. The gods meditated on how they could regain their suzerainty over heaven. Then Brhaspati, their priest, advised them to perform a cow sacrifice first and then all other sacrifices.58 Then the gods gathered all cattle for sacrifice, but left them for grazing in charge of Saramā. While she was doing her duty at Dharādhara, the demons went there, saw the cows and sought advice of their preceptor, Šukra, who promptly ordered them to seize the cows. They did so but Saramā, who was 56. Mbh. Sabhāparva Ed. F. Edgerton. 11.29.31, (Critical Edition, BORI), 1944. 57. Mbh. Äranyakaparva, Ed. V. S. Sukthankar, 219.33 (Critical Edition, BORI), 1942. 58.

They wanted to square up by conciliation and, offering the milk of the cows for her to drink, requested her not to report the theft of the cows to the Lord of the Gods. So they left her in the woods and walked away with the booty. Saramā returned to the gods, trembling and paid due homage to Indra. Meanwhile the Maruts had been secretly deputed by Indra for protection of the heavenly dog. Now, they also came and stood before Indra. Indra asked Saramā 4 What happened to the cows ? ' 'I know not,' she replied. Maruts were asked, and they described all that Saramā did. Then Indra rose and struck her with her foot. Milk began to flow from her mouth and Saramā made way back to where the cows were. Indra followed with his army,60 killed the demons and recovered the cows. Then he performed many sacrifices, fought the demon hosts again and re-established himself as Lord of Heaven. The impression, by the time of this Purāņa, is certainly that Saramā was a dog gifted of course with heavenly powers. But her being enticed by a cup of milk was rather earthly. The only support for this version is the Brhaddevatā account, whereas the evidence for her exemplary conduct appears to be overwhelming. XII RECENT OPINIONS Professor Kühn was the first, we are told, ' to analyse the meaning and char- acter of Saramā, arriving at the conclusion that Saramā meant storm,61 and that the Sanskrit word was identical with the Teutonic storm and with the Greek horme. Disagreeing with this theory, Max Müller has tried to prove that Saramā is Dawn, rather one of the many names of Dawn. The myth is a reproduction of the old 59.

L. HARIYAPPA story of the break of day. The bright cows, the rays of the sun or the rain clouds - for both go by the same name - have been stolen by the powers of darkness, by the Night and her manifold progeny. Gods and men are anxious for their return. But where are they to be found ? They are hidden in a dark and strong stable, or scattered along the ends of the sky, and the robbers will not restore them. At last in the farthest distance the first signs of the Dawn appear, she peers about, and runs with lightning quickness, it may be, like a hound after a scent, across the darkness of the sky. She is looking for something, and, following the right path, she has found it. She has heard the lowing of the cows, and she returns to her starting place with more intense splendour. After her return there rises Indra, the god of light, ready to do battle in right earnest against the gloomy powers, to break open the strong stable in which the bright cows were kept, and to bring light, and strength, and life back to his pious worshippers. This is the simple myth of Sarama, composed originally of a few fragments of ancient speech, such as : ' the Paņis stole the cows ', i.e. the light of day is gone, ' Saramā looks for the cows ', i.e. the Dawn is spreading, c Indra has burst the dark stable ' i.e. the sun has arisen."62 Coming to the field of comparative mythology, Max Müller recognises " in Helen, the sister of the Dioskuroi, the Vedic Saramā, their names being phonetically identical, not only in every consonant and vowel but even in their accent."63 Bloomfield identifies the ' four-eyed bitch ' mentioned in AV 5.20.7 with Saramā : " Thou art the eye of Kašyapa and the eye of the four-eyed bitch. Like the sun, moving in the bright day, make thou the Pisāca evident to me."64 Macdonell65 and Keith66 have preferred to stick to the evidence of the Vedic texts scrupulously. There is nothing in the RV directly to show that Saramā was there conceived as a dog. Saramā's part in the recovery of the cows has been duly appreciated. Sometimes the cows are spoken of in the Veda as confined by the demon Vala without reference to the Paņis and driven out by Indra. Sometimes also, it must be pointed out, the event is alluded to without reference to Saramā, for, as we obser e elsewhere, the cattle lifting was a very usual way of provoking or harassing the enemy. Agni, Brhaspati and the Aňgirasas are also actively interest- ed in the affair. " The meaning of the myth can hardly be doubtful," Keith 62.

The cows must be, not rain-clouds, as sometimes in the myth of Vrtra, but the morning beams of light or perhaps the red clouds of dawn, there is little difference between the two conceptions."67 Speaking in general terms about the appearance of the dog, or the eagle or the one- footed goat in the Veda, Keith postulates : "In all these cases there is clearly either theriomorphism or the natural association of animals with the gods on the model of the relation of man and the animals."68 Oldenberg69 treats the legend, we are told, (10.108) as an aetiological myth to explain men's ownership of cows. Hillebrandt70 finds the dawn in Sarama and the sun and the moon in the Sarameyas. Appreciation of RV 10.108 in its poetic aspect has been made by several scholars, but a fine study of it is recorded by Aufrecht. The whole legend is studied briefly in its historical aspect, comparing the RV version with that of the Varāhapurāņa. The hymn is translated and annotated. He concludes : " The old poem is remarkable for its poetical value apart from its mythological contents. The insolence and later the cowardice of the Paņis in opposition to the earnestness and loyalty of Sarama are seen in such sharp and striking contrast that one dares to mention this poem as the most beautiful ornament of the Rgveda."71 SUMMARY Based on the RV Samhitā, the Sarama story may be restated as follows : Enemies used to harass the gods now and again by stealing their cows. On one occasion, it happened that the Paņis stole them and hid them in their stronghold. The seven priests, who are commonly known as Añgirasas, first noticed the loss and apprised Indra. They praised him, and, rallying the folk around, propitiated him with sacrifice, so that the great god may recover the cows. Indra naturally was pleased and, by the suggestion of the Añgirasas, deputed Sarama to search for the lost property and bring news. Sarama took this opportunity to claim, as reward, food for her progeny in the shape, perhaps, of the milk of the divine cowsģ It was granted. Then she went on her journey which was rather arduous but was fortunate enough to discover the cows after crossing the mighty river Rasā. Finding that the Paņis had imprisoned the kine in the mountain stronghold, she took them by surprise and charged them with theft. The Paņis made sure of her credentials, that she came as messenger from Indra. Being in such vantage and endowed with strength and strategem, the Paņis held out against Saramā's threats. But realising her mettle, tried to persuade her not to return at all, by offering a share of the treasure and a treatment as if she were their sister. Sarama did not yield. On the other hand she warned them to flee away from the place leaving the cows for Indra or take the consequences when the irrepressible hero would 67. KRPV p. 128. 68. Ibid., p. 192, cf.

Then she returned to Indra and reported her discovery, whereupon, he granted the milk-food and much more for her progeny, which, as the seer Parāšara, son of Šakti, declares, mankind today is enjoying.72 It is the direct result of Saramā's sagacity and influence with the Lord of the Gods. Sarama is respected by the seers and the gods as one who follows Rta the path of Truth or the established path. Hence she was entrusted with an important mission, and truly adhering to the Right path, she succeeded in catching the thieves. Now with the light-footed Sarama to lead the way, Indra, attended with the Añgirasas and the Maruts marched against the enemy, rent apart the mountain ; the Paņis had apparently fled leaving the booty behind. The Angirasas convened an assembly to celebrate this victory : milk was poured profusely to all. Indra was praised and Sarama was warmly felicitated. Such is the Sarama episode construed just according to the Rgvedic text. It may be emphasised that the Samhitã has conceived and narrated the event in its most human aspects and bearings. With the lapse of time, the great exploits and experiences of the Vedic Heroes, which were once green in everybody's memory and which were recorded in simple yet grand poetry, began to lose their freshness and point. The sacrifices expanded and the very same poetical expressions were used in several sacrificial contexts. Naturally the links became hazy, the relevancy came to be questioned. This was probably the cause of new interpretations and concepts gathering round old texts. Thus the Vajasaneyi Samhitā unequivocally pronounced Sarama as Speech (Vāg vai Sarama). The Taittirïya Äranyaka construed her as the sacred altar (Vedi). The Atharva-veda has a place for Sarama, she having been invoked in connection with the ceremony of the gift of a bull (Rsabhotsarga). This is quite in consonance with the atmosphere of the Atharva-veda, which was charged with magic and charm which pleased the spirits and brought gratification to the worship- pers who were now far removed from the plane of the virile gods and the resplendent sages of the Rgveda. The Jaiminiya Brāhmaņa, supported by the Sãtyãyanaka, confirms the fact that Sarama took opportunity to secure the milk-food for her progeny, viz. mankind itself. So far as the story of the stolen cows is concerned, the JB says that Indra deputed Suparņa first but, he having proved faithless, sent Sarama on the errand, and succeeded. Yaska adheres to the main outlines of the original story but is disposed to designate Sarama, as Devasuni (heavenly bitch). The cue of the betrayal motif was however taken up by the Brhaddevata, but the betrayal was ascribed to Sarama herself ; Suparņa is not mentioned at all. The other texts more or less agreeing with the main story, we come down to the Purāņas, according to one of which the Vārāha, the legend is expanded on all sides : Indra's fortunes fluctuate often, he no longer enjoys world-supremacy. Now he is displaced from heaven 72. RV 1.72.8 Vidád gávyam Sarámâ drlhám urvám yénâ nú kam marnisi bhójate vít /</page><page sequence="61">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 183 and only after years of penance and sacrifice could he regain his old glory. Demons, other than the Paņis, take the field, they are Yidyut and Suvidyut. Sarama is placed in charge of the cow-stall. These demons tried to lift the cows but she was quite vigilant and caught them, but alas, for the moment she fell a victim to their machinations and was lured by a draught of milk. Indra was clever enough to have deputed theMaruts to rush to her rescue in case she was attacked by anybody. Now they found out the ruse and reported to Indra. Saramā was unmasked. The cows were however recovered and the demons destroyed. Taking up the Atharvan trend, we find Sarama as a Spirit to conjure with. She is invoked to free the child from the barking cough, for instance. She is again a ' manusya-graha ' which attacks the womb of the females. Thus following Saramā through the vicissitudes of Ages, one is left with the impression that her story is full of human appeal. Her character is upright, her conduct honorable and her heart full of affection for posterity. Were she the mother of the Särameyas, i.e. the two brindled hounds of Yama, Šyama and Šabala, it was only in this sense that she was responsible for the creation of the canine species in the same manner as Kadrū became the mother of serpents and Vinata the mother of eagles. She was herself no dog or bitch. With the actual text of the Rgveda before us, it is quite unwarranted, nay, uncharitable, to describe her as Devašunī - the 6 divine bitch ' as some have fancifully translated the term. Mythological explanations of the Saramā legend have been offered by eminent scholars, saying that Saramā is the Storm or the Dawn. The tenor of Rgvedic poetry does not seem to favour any interpretation other than literary. Correlation of the live personalities of the Veda with the shining stars of heaven or the wonderful phenomena of Nature or the varied patterns of sacrificial tapestry has become traditional. It is a privilege of the specialist which cannot be denied. But for the common man, it is equally natural to conceive of them as quite human, as real events, inspiring and instructive.</page><page sequence="62">184 H- L- HARIYAPPA CHAPTER II THE LEGEND OF ŠUNAŠŠEPA Šunassepa is a famous rsi of old. Eight entire hymns1 of the Rgveda, aggregat- ing to 107 verses, are ascribed to his seership, wherein he has praised and propitiated various gods : 2 Prajāpati, Agni, Savitr, Varuna, Visvedevas, Indra, Asvins, Usas and Soma-pavamāna. Šunassepa is himself referred to by name in three mantras. Two of them3 represent him in bonds having appealed to Varuna for release, whereas, the last mantra which is addressed to Agni and that by a different seer,4 informs us that Agni released Šunassepa " from a thousand stakes." Thus, Šunaššepa's deliverance from the yüpastambha is undoubtedly a vedic fact. The present attempt is to trace the growth of this germ into a spreading chestnut despite the ravages of Time. I RGVEDA The Rgveda references are as follows : (A) Verses wherein Šunaššepa's name is mentioned. (a) Tád ínnáktam tád divā máhyamahub tád ayám kéto hrdá ā ví caste / Šúnaššépo yám áhvad grbhitáb só asmán rājā Váruno mumoktu // RV 1.24.12. Translation - They say that to me by night and by day, and the same sentiment strikes my heart (mind) as well. May Varuņa the king, to whom Šunassepa in bonds addressed himself, liberate us. (b) Šúnaššépo hyáhvad grbhïtàfc trisvãdityám drupadésu baddháfr / ávainam rājā Várunafr sasrjyât vidvām ádabdho ví mumoktu pāšān // RV 1.24.13. 1.

Agni aione was approached twice (AB), once with one mantra (RV 1.24.2) and the second time with a series of 22 mantras (1.26.1-10 and 27.1-12). Geldner (Der Rigveda I, p. 21) takes both verses (1.24.1. and 2) as addressed to Agni. The reason, perhaps, is that " Ka " is god Prajāpati accord- ing to tradition, but an interrogative pronoun according to recent opinion. "Ivo vai nāma prajāpati h " (AB 3.21) iti šruteh kasya iti sabdasãmãnyãt anayâ prajāpatireva upādrtah iti gam- yate - Sãyana. 3. KV 1.24.12 ana 13. 4. itv 5.2.7 ivumara son oí Atri is tne rsi.</page><page sequence="63">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 185 Translation - To three stakes bound, Šunasšepa5 has verily addressed himself to the son of Aditi (Varuņa). May Varuna the king set this (suppliant) free, may He, (who is) wise and above restrictions, entirely remove the fetters. (c) Šúnaš cicchépam níditam sahásrât yüpäd amuñco ásamista hl sálj / evāsmād agne ví mumugdhi pāsān hótas cikitva ihá tu nisádya //6 RV 5.2.7. Translation - You did liberate the fast-fettered Šunašsepa from a thousand fold stake and he became pacified, indeed. Even so do you, O Learned Priest of the gods, Agni, sitting here (with us) loosen our bonds. On a close study of the above verses, certain impressions are irresistible. The first two verses which are ascribed to Šunasšepa do not seem to be his at all from a rational point of view. In the first, the worshipper prays, " May Varuņa the king, to whom Šunašsepa addressed himself, liberate us," that is, on the precedent of Šunaššepa's being saved by Varuņa, a later devotee is seeking similar favour. All right, but the very next verse says : Šunaššepa in fetters prays to God Varuņa : may Varuņa set him free and may he remove the fetters. The situation must be that while Šunaššepa is praying to the god for succour, those by the side are recom- mending him for Varuņa's mercy. This is in itself reasonable, but how, at all, is it consistent with the previous verse ? There, it is definitely a past event, here 5. 4 trisu drupadesu baddhah ' literally would mean 4 bound to three stakes ' But the threefold nature of the stakes is not quite intelligible, whether Šunasšepa was bound to three different posts or whether, as Säyana says, he was tied to a single post in three places (trisankhyä- kesu drupadesu droh kästhasya yüpasva padesu pradesavišesesu baddhah). But, then, how to reconcile the other statement that Šunasšepa was delivered from a thousand stakes (Súnaš cicché- pam niditam sahasrād yupäd amuñcah) ? Wilson (Tr. Vol. I, p. 63, 1850) understands a sort of tripod and adds 44 its specification is consistent with the popular legend." This is to be corroborat- ed. Geldner translates 4 an drei Blöcke gebunden ' (i.e. bound to three blocks), and says in the note : 44 drupadā (eigentlich wohl Fussgestell) ist der Block, in den der Gefangene gelegt wurde (AV 19.47.9, 50.1), AV 6.63.3 das Fusseisen.'" While describing the process of niyojana i.e. . fastening the victim to the sacrificial post, Sayana's commentary (AB) is somewhat interesting : Ajīgarta is supposed to say - 44 aham enam Šunassepam yupe niyoksyämi rasanavā katyâm, sirasi, pādavor baddhvā rasanâgrasya yupe bandhanam niyojanam tad aham karisyâmi." Niyojana is defined as the act of fastening with rope the victim in three parts of his person namely, the waist, the head and the feet, and then the end of the rope to be tied to the sacrificial post. Rather an unequivocal explanation, it perhaps describes the actual practice at sacrifice as Säyana knew (cf. RV 1.24.15 and 25.21). With such dubious evidence, it was best to translate literally. 6. Sahasrāt anekarūpāt yūpāt (Säyana). Regarding the unusual separation of a proper noun Šunaš ciccliepam, Sāvaņa remarks - Šunasšepamiti padasya madhye padäntarasya samhi- tãyâm vyatyayenãvasthitih. The advent of a different word in the middle of one w^rd is there- fore acknowledged to be an irregularity, cf. BD 2.115. áunašsepam narāšamasam dyäva nah prthivīti ca / Niraskrteti prabhrtisv arthādāsīt kramo yatha // which indicates that the regular order of words was determined according to the sense, when the text read like - Sunas cicchepam, narā vā samsam, dyäva nah prthivī, niru svasāram askrta. It is to be noted that the Padapãtha restores the word e.g. Šunah'šēpam/ cit etc.</page><page sequence="64">186 H- L- HARIYAPPA it is like a thing happening in our presence. The verbs used in the two verses do not help us to disentangle, because they seem to have been used indiscriminately too, e.g. ahvat (a-Aorist Indicative, 3rd sing, of hū, to call), mumoktu (perfect imperative, 3rd sing, of muc, to release), sasrjyât (perfect optative, 3rd sing, of srj, to emit).7 Hence they cannot enlighten the sequence of events. The legend depicts that these mantras were uttered by Šunaššepa in order to obtain release, whereas the two verses, just referred to regard the release as a thing of the past. Two inferences are possible, (a) These are not Šunaššepa hymns at all (RV 1.24 to 30), but tradition so ascribes, i.e. at the Samhitā stage, these hymns were assembl- ed and the occurrence of Šunaššepa' s name in the two verses was responsible for the ascription ; hence we shall accept it on faith. ( b ) Or, the two verses in question are a later insertion or interpolation, if that fearful word may be used : The various hymns seen by Šunaššepa, handed down by tradition, were put together by the Samhitā-designers, in the course of which it is just possible that these two verses were inserted in order to remind themselves of that great Vedic event. However reasonable, the first inference appears rather irrational, as it carries possibilities to the very extreme. The second inference may be considered.8 It becomes plausible if we remove the two verses from their context and review the whole collection ; then, it will read like the group of praises and psalms from any other poet of the Rgveda. The two verses, no doubt, lend colour to the whole group of seven hymns (RV 1.24-30) and specially to RV 1.24.1 and 2, in the light of the " Pararkšata-gāthā " or the Šunaššepakhyana which is elaborately related in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa.9 If scholars believe in the theory of interpolation as an important and inevitable factor in textual criticism, then there can be no reason to demur at this conclusion, namely, Šunaššepa did not compose the two mantras (1.24.12) and 13), but a later poet, possibly the compilers of the Šatarcina mandala. Interpolation is a natural instinct in man and as such cannot be considered a crime. Considering the texts which have been transmitted for centuries by oral tradition only - viz. the Veda and Vedic literature - the aspect of interpolation need not be doubted at all, " for the organs of tradition were not machines, but men."10 It is well-known that many verses and hymns have formed part of the later Samhitās of the Yajus, Sāma and Atharva- vedas. Many a variant reading has been noticed of the Rgvedic text.11 Such a thing could be detected because of the availability, of the different recensions. In the case of the Rgveda, only the 7. MVG paragraphs 508, 490 and 489 respectively. 8. Compare Roth's opinion, analogous to this, explained by Keith in his introduction to the Rig-Veda Brāhmaņas Translated (HOS Vol. 25 - 1920) p. 64. 9. 7.13-18, more of this in another section. 10.

Who knows whatBäskala and others would have revealed in a crucial passage like this ? Another fact is worth notice. Šunaššepa's deliverance is, to Višvāmitra, a feather in the cap. The achievement is of no less magnitude than his crossing of the Rivers (RV 3.33). But Šunaššepa, the god-given (Deva-rāta) son and heir to Visvāmitra, is nowhere, even indirectly, mentioned in the Visvāmitra mandala of two and sixty hymns either by the Seer or byhisdescendents. Nor is this miracle refleceted anywhere among the hundred and four hymns of Vasistha, who officiated as the Brahmā priest in that sacrifice which witnessed Šunaššepa's 4 sacrifice ' and deliverence. Further, it was the fancy of a member of the Atri family, - in no way connected with the affair, - to record the event in clear terms (Šúnaš cicchépam níditam sahásrât, yūpād amuñco ásamista hi sáh/ 5.2.7ab). Undoubtedly, Kumāra Ätreya (the Rsi of the hymn) is describing what was current in his family circle. A slight disharmony may be discerned even here in that Agni delivered Šunaššepa from the stakes, not Varuņa. Strangely enough, the Samhitā appears to corrobo- rate this, because Šunašsepa, - let us believe the traditional account for the moment - after approaching God KA in the first instance (1.24.1), addresses himself next to Agni (Agnér vayám prathamásyâmrtânâm mánâmahe cāru devásya nāma// 1.24.2). There is, of course, an appeal to Varuņa in 1.24.12 and 13 for freedom from the bonds, but these we have preferred to consider as later insertions. 1.24.1512 and 1.25.2113 appeal to Varuņa to release the chains from the top, the middle and the bottom. The pāsa is a special attribute of Varuņa14 and a prayer to him should be naturally charged with that sentiment. Šunašsepa was Varuņa-grhīta15 (seized by Varuņa), says the Yajurveda. According to the graphic narration in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa, the release from the fetters was actually effected when the three mantras in praise of Usas16 were uttered one by one. So with regard to this great Deliverance, we shall revert to the original document, the Rgveda, and repeat the problem which faced Šunaššepa himself - " which God's charming name shall we cherish " ! (B) Other verses indirectly bearing on the Šunaššepa legend : The opeining verses of the Šunaššepa series have a peculiar appeal ; hence they are recorded here - 12. Úduttamám Varuņa pāsam asmád ávâdhamám ví madhyamám srathãya / áthâ vayám ãditya vraté távãnâgaso áditye syâma // 13. Úduttamám mumugdhi no ví pāsam madhyamám erta / ávãdhamãni jiváse // 11. Release from Varuņa-pāša is the burden of the prayers addressed to that God in all the Sarhhitās, most of which do not refer to the Šunaššepa incident at all. E.g. the verse 44 Údutta- mám," which is a prayer to Varuņa for release from his fetters is cited about 20 times in the various Vedic texts, it is only on two occasions it is associated with Šunassepa. Cf. Bloomfield's con- cordance, and VI 2.386 ni under Šunašsepa. 15. Cf. TS 5.2.1.3 ; KS 19.11. 16.

Translation - Of whom or of which god among the immortals shall we cherish the charming name ? Who would give us back to the great Aditi ? And would I ever see father and mother?17 God Agni's charming name we shall cherish, for he is the first of the immortals. He would give us back to the great Aditi. And then would I see father and mother. Shorn of the story-background, the first verse reflects the fervency with which the devotee asks himself the question : which god's name shall we cherish ? Such an enquiring spirit is quite in consonance with the spirit of the Vedic seer, at the dawn of our civilization. Compare the other hymn ' Kásmai de vaya ' which has a similar appeal. But it is the reference to the father and the mother that makes the allusion to some exent absolutely reasonable if not necessary. 17. Text - pitáram ca dršéyam mãtáram ca. This is usually understood to express the anxiety on the part of Šunassepa to get back to his parents, so he laments - am I destined to see my parents once again and so on. (cf. Nītimāftjarī. st. 11). This is not correct. As we agree that the verses are expressed by Šunassepa, it is necessary to look into the situation in which he simply ran, door to door, in search of a saviour. The idea is : thus have I been foresaken by parents who gave me birth in this world. Ah, they are going to cut me up as if I were an animal ! Is there a god who could restore me to life on Earth (to Aditi) ? Can I find a father and a mother once again ? Let me think of Agni, he is the foremost of the gods. He will restore me to life and I would find a father and a mother (in him, i.e. in Agni indeed). That is how Šunassepa's situation is heightened with pathos. lie never wished to run back to his parents, (cf. Rāmā- vaņa l.G4.4-Gorresio) Na me'sti mātā na pitā na suhrnna ca bāndhavāh / Trātum arhasi mām tyaktam bandhubhih saraņāgatam // This is corroborated by the evidence of the Aitareya which depicts the situation graphically : atha ha Šunassepa īksāmcakre, amānusam iva vai mā visasisyanti, hantāham devatā upadhāvāmīti, sa prajāpatim eva prathamam devatānām anusasāra, kasya nūnam katamasyāmrtānām ityetayarcä / As the father Ajīgarta came forward, sharpening the knife, in order to cut him up, Šunassepa, in utter consternation and helplessness, bursts forth with the mantra, 4 kasya niinam ' ending with 4 pitáram ca dršéyam mâtarám ca'. In such a situation, that Šunassepa was prompted by filial love to say it, is truly incoherent. Secondly, we may observe that Šunassepa's lament, whether he is destined to find a father and a mother on earth when the real parents deserted him, was heard by the gods. Višvāmitra became the father ; gods blessed the change over, which was in the nature of an adoption ; Šunassepa was named Devarāta : 4 God-given '</page><page sequence="67">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES ļgg We may at once believe that Šunassepa uttered it when he was in such a predicament. It was at a later stage of course that the memorable verses found place in the Samhitā. One word about the hundred verses, alleged by the Aitareya Brāhmaņa to have been uttered by Šunassepa when he was yoked for the sacrifice. A perusal of the said verses will at once tell us, from their tenor and content, that they were not appropriate for the occasion.18 A man destined to die would first pray for his life, not for cattle, not for the destruction of the enemy ; nor even could he have the peace of mind to dilate upon the merits and exploits of each god in such a complacent manner, sometimes providing even sublime and serene poetry. Except for three or four verses in the whole series,19 there is not much of a direct appeal for deliverance from the stakes. Dare we then discredit the account of the Aitareya Brāhmaņa ? No, we need not discredit, but we can clearly perceive the raison ďetre of such a development. Mr. Narahari20 has related the Šunassepa hymns indicated in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa straight to their Rgvedic source, chapter and verse, about which fact, however, there was never a doubt implied or expressed. Keith's observation, with which Narahari is unable to agree,21 was with regard not to the authenticity but to the relevancy of the Šunassepa hymns in their being worked into the Šunas- sepa legend. Keith has in view the subject-matter and the general trend of the hymns while making the remark in question.22 After tracing the AB quotations to their Rgvedic source, Narahari declares " It is thus clear that the account given in the AB about Šunassepa is ratified to a very great extent by the Rgveda." 18. cf. Keith. JRAS (1911), p. 988, Winternitz HIL Vol. I, p. 215 (1927) ; Wilson quoting Dr. Rosen (Tr. Vol. I, p. 60 original edition), also Muir, OST 1. p.359. 19. RV 1.24.1,2,15; 25.21. 20.

The expression Šatarcina is thus explained by the Aitareya Āraņvaka : Tam satam varsāņyabhyārcat tasmāt sat am varsāņi purusãyuso bha vanti, tam yaccha- tam varsāņyabhyārcat tasmāt satarcinas tasmācchatarcina ityãcaksata etam e va santam // 2.2.1. 44 For a hundred years he approached it. Therefore a hundred are the years of the life of man. Because he approached him for one hundred years, therefore, they are the Šatarcins. Therefore they call him who is (prāņa) the Šatarcins." Tr. Keith (Anecdota Oxoniensia Series, Oxford). But Sadgurusisya (Macdonell, Sarvā. p. 59) has a more rational explanation.

The quotations which are in the nature of praise and prayer to the several gods, do by no stretch of imagination, suggest any detail of the story. The Rgvedic statement has only this much to say that Šunaššepa who had been bound by fetters to the sacrificial post was liberated by Varuņa (1.24.12) or by Agni (5.2.7) according to another seer. It is only reasonable to suppose that the Šatarcina mandala22 was compiled, by putting together the centurion seers and their hymns together ; among them came the Rsi Šunaššepa. Based on the then current popular stories, the redactors introduced the name of Šunasšepa also in the collection, as above explained. And the Aitareya Brāhmaņa spun out a beautiful yarn and found use for the series of hymns collected in the mandala. It cannot be explained, however, why and how the Šunašsepa hymn in the Pavamāna mandala (RV 9.3) escaped the notice of the AB in this connection. Needless to say that Soma was as much an object of praise in a sacrifice as the other gods. II SAMHITĀS OTHER THAN THE RGVEDA (1) The Taittiriya Samhitā has the following passage referring to Šunašsepa story - Šúnaššépam Ãjigartim Varuno'grhņāt sá etām Vāruņī'm apašyat táyã vai sá ātmānam Varuņapāšād amuñcat Varuņo vā etám grhņāti yá ukhām pratimuñcáta úduttamám Varuņa pāšam asmád ítyãhâtmânam evaítáyâ /23 " Varuņa seized Šunaššepa Äjigarti, he saw this verse adressed to Varuņa, by it he freed himself from the noose of Varuņa ; Varuņa seizes him who takes the fire-pan, " From us the highest knot, O Varuņa " he says, verily, thereby he frees himself from Varuņa's noose."24 The Taittiriya context is the 4 preparation of the ground for the Fire'. It can be seen how artificial is the connection of the Rgvedic mantra. ' Úduttamám ' (RV 1.24.15) praying Varuņa to loosen his pāša at the top, middle and bottom. The outlook is entirely sacrificial. At any rate what is important for our study is the allusion to the bare fact that Šunaššepa was seized by Varuņa and when he praised him with this mantra " Úduttamám "25 he was released from the fetters. Kāņva (82), Savya Ãrigirasa (72), Nodhā Gautama (74), Parāsara Šaktya (56), Gotama Rāhūgaņa (204), Kutsa Āngirasa (212), Kaksīvat (151), Parucchepa (100), Dīrghatamas (242) and Agastya (218). Just a few verses are not accounted as they occur in the Samvāda hymns. A single hymn of 8 verses is ascribed to Jetā Mādhuccandasa. The above details are given in order to show that after the family-maridalas, the next step in the Rgveda-redaction was to bring together the the works of seers, next in importance. No definite principle can yet be discerned, underlying these 44 collected works." 23. TS 5.2.1.3 (Ānandāsrama edition). 24. Tr. Keith. The Veda of the Black Yajus School (HOS Vols. 18 and 19) 1914. lhe present reference is to Vol. 19 p. 404. 25. This verse has been borrowed from RV by all the other Samhitās, which fact emphasises the importance of God Varuņa in men's conduct and outlook. Release from the chain of worldly existence or final emancipation is yet the highest pursuit of man according to our belief even today.</page><page sequence="69">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 191 (2) The Kāthaka Samhitā - Uduttamam Varuna pāšam asmad iti Šunaššepo vā etām Ãjigartir Varuņagrhīto'pašyat tayâ vai sa Varuņapāšād amucyata Varuņapāšam evaitayã pramuñcate ... // 26 This passage provides support for the version of the TS. Šunaššepa, son of Ajīgarta, seized by Varuņa saw the mantra " Uduttamam " etc. and thereby was freed from Varuņa's noose, and Varuņa's noose will loosen itself with this mantra. (3) The Kapisthala-Katha27 alludes to the Šunasšepa legend in exactly the same words as the above. (4) The Atharva-Veda Samhitā does not record the Šunaššepa story but has two hymns of which he is the Seer, viz. AV. 6.25 and 7.83.28 The former according to Kaušika Sūtra accompanies a rite against a disease of the neck and shoulders (gaņdāmālā). The latter is a hymn to Varuņa praying for relief from fetters. It is also held as a remedy against dropsy. The third verse of this hymn is the same as RV 1.24.15, the famous "Uduttamam." Ill BRĀHMANAS (1) Šunasšepa is immortalised in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa.29 It is mysterious, however, that neither the famous Vedic seer nor the story of his deliverance is ever referred to in any other Brāhamņa. To recapitulate the story as given in the AB : Harišcandra of the Iksvāku race, son of Vedhas, was childless. Once the sages Parvata and Nãrada were his guests. The king asked30 the latter with wonderment as to why all beings under the Sun, endowed with intelligence or no, alike long for a son, what is it exactly they gain etc. And Nārada came forth with his reply in ten gāthās, expatiating on the merits of begetting a son, e.g. " Food is life for man, clothing his protection, gold his beauty, cattle his strength. His wife is a friend, his daughter is a pity, but the son is his Light in the highest world."31 Nārada further, advised Harišcandra to approach Varuņa praying for a son whom he might again surrender to him in a sacrifice. Accordingly the king approached Varuņa who granted his request. 26. KS 19.11 (Kāthaka-Sarhhitā ed. Satavalekar, Aundh) 27. Kap. S. 21,1 (Kapisthala-Katha-Samhitā ed. Raghu Vīra, I.) 28.

But on the birth of the Light of his heart as much as of the worlds, the king was loth to give him up to the God. So he pleaded excuses and put off the dreadful event successively, for ten days of confinement, then when the teeth emerge, when they fall, emerge again, and finally when the boy grows into a youth fit to wear armour. Varuņa persisted in his demand and Rohita, being apprised by the father of the old contract with the God, somehow did not submit but went away to the forest, bow in hand. For one full year he wandered. Meanwhile Varuņa was wroth and seized Hariscandra, who, as a result began to suffer from dropsy. Rohita heard this and was coming back to town when Indra, in the guise of a man, came up and exhorted him to wander more and more. There is such good in moving about, not sitting idle, for " The fortune of a man who sits, sits also, it rises when he rises, it sleeps when he sleeps, it moves well when he moves. Wander!"32 Or again, "He who wanders finds honey, he who wanders finds sweet figs (udumbaram); look at the pre-eminence of the Sun, who wandering, never33 tires." Thus on the sixth round, Rohita met, in the forest, the sage Ajïgarta, son of Sûyavasa, seized by starvation.34 He had three sons, Šunahpuccha Šunassepa and Šunolāngūla. Rohita said, " O sage, I will give a hundred, I will buy myself off with one of these (sons)." Then the father was unwilling to part with the eldest, and the mother with the youngest. Hence the middle one Šunassepa was sold. Rohita brought him to his father and told him his proposal. Hariscandra approached Varuņa who readily agreed. The sacrifice began, eminent priests officiating. Višvāmitra as Hotr, Jama- dagni as Adhvaryu, Ayâsya as Udāgtr and Vašistha as Brahmā. The victim was due to be taken through various rites before the actual sacrifice, but the rites of niyojana (binding the pasu to the stake) and visasana (cutting it up with knife) were too repulsive to the good Jamadagni (the Adhvaryu, on whom devolved all the manual labour of the Sacrifice), he refused. There came this Ajïgarta, again, willing to bind him to the stake for a hundred more ; and further to cut him up with knife for a third hundred cows. Inhumanity perhaps reached its zenith, difficult even for the gods to bear.35 So, when the poor victim, Šunassepa, a human being after all, endowed with thinking, poured forth his fervent prayers to the gods in utter 32. Äste bhaga asïnasya ūrdhvas tisthati tisthatah / Šete nipadyamänasya carati carato bhagah caraiva // Ibid. 7.15. 33. Caran vai madhu vindati caran svādum udumbaram / Sûryasya pašya sremāņam yo na tandrayate caran // Ibid. 34. Here is a genuine difficulty. The text reads - " asanayâ parītam " how can it mean ' overcome with hunger ?' It were well to have anasanayä ( = anasanena, fem. being Vedic). Keith evidently felt it ; and preferred the Šānkh ŠS reading ' asanāyāparītam' (Rig- Veda Brāhmaņas Translated, HOS Vol. 25, 1920. p. 303 n. 9). Asanâyã (f) = hunger (Monier- Williams), But, pray, look at the other ghastly attribute, ' putrām bhaksamāņam ' in the gãnkhâyanq, ! Perhaps that renders Hohita's offer to buy up the son a logical step. 35. VI says that at this stage Visvāmitra's advice inspired Šunassepa to ask the gods to pelease hin}. So also Wilson in his resumé. This is not true to the Aitareya, wherein, Šunassepa, having been driven by necessity, simply 4 ran ' to the gods - 4 amānusamiva vai mā visasisyanti, hantāham devatā upadhāvāmlti ' Ref. VI, II, pp. 385-6, Wilson RV Tr. Vo Vol. I, p. 60 n. Visvāmitra's advice to the effect is, no doubt, mentioned in later literature like the Ramayana, which however provides justification for Šunassepa choosing to sit on the lap of Višvāmitra, (ankam āsasāda, see infra 38) arrçidst so many grçat men,</page><page sequence="71">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 193 helplessness, they heard ! Agni, the liaison deity, between gods and mortals, steered Šunaššepa through ; the catastrophe was averted. (Prajāpati), Agni, Savitr, Varuņa, Višvedevas, Indra, Ašvins and Usas - all these were propitiated with fulsome praise. Indra presented a golden chariot to Šunašsepa. As the praise of Usas, in three verses, was being uttered, the bonds fell off one by one. Šunaš- sepa was free. And Harišcandra was at the same time cured of the ailment.36 Then the high priests invited Šunaššepa to perform the closing rite called the abhisecaniya. Šunaššepa in this ceremony saw what is called the ' añj assava,'37 a certain improved method of pressing the Soma. Naturally afterwards, he became the idol of admiration of all concerned. But what was his station in future ? Forsaken by his parents, what home to seek for shelter ? He straight away went and sat on the lap of Višvāmitra, as a son sits on the father's.38 When " all's well that end's well," Ajīgarata asked Višvāmitra to give back his son. The latter refused on the ground that the gods gave Šunaššepa to him. Thus he became Devarāta Vaišvāmitra. Then Ajigarta addressed his invitation to Šunaššepa himself - " At least, you come, both of us (father and mother) invite you. Añgi- rasa you are by birth, son of Ajigarta and reputed as poet. O sage, do not break away from the ancestral line. Do return to me." How courteous and compli- mentary ! Šunaššepa, however, sharply retorted : " They saw you, knife in hand, a thing which they did not find even among the Šūdras. And in lieu of me, you, O Añgiras, chose to have three hundred cows." " That is just what burns my heart, my dear," replied Ajïgrata, " I verily committed a sin. Let me make amends, all the three hundred cows will go to you." Šunaššepa said again, " Once a man commits sin, he will surely commit another. You did not shun to behave like a Šūdra, and an inexpiable sin have you committed." Višvāmitra supported this last statement, rapprochement was impossible. Višvāmitra renewed his invitation to Šunaššepa to join him only : " You shall be the eldest of my sons. Your progeny will have priority. My divine her- itage shall be yours, with that I invite you." Much too clever for an ancient tale : Šunaššepa wanted his rank and status in the family to be clearly defined and accept- ed unequivocally by all the heirs concerned. Šunaššepa in this context addressed Višvāmitra as 4 Rājaputra,' which, according to Sâyana, raised an issue as to how a Brāhmaņa by birth can change over to a Ksatriya clan. But Višvāmitra, " friend of all," was truly magnanimous. He had a hundred and one sons. He called them all promptly, and said " Listen to me Madhucchandas, Rsabha, Reņu, Astaka (and all), Are there any amoung you brothers who are not for Šunaššepa's pri- ority ?"39 Madhucchandas was midmost of the sons. The fifty brothers elder to 36. The pertinent RV references have been considered in the previous section. 37.

The other fifty with Madhucchandas as leader40 humbly submitted : whatever father proposes, we shall abide by, and turning to Šunaššepa, gave him word also, saying 6 we shall put you in front and shall remain behind you.' Višvāmitra was much pleased, blessed them all heartily. Devarāta (Šunaššepa) inherited a double share viz. the overlordship of the Jahnus and the divine lore.41 This is the Šunašsepa legend which is prescribed to be narrated at a king's coronation. Seated on a golden seat, the Hotā narrates, seated also on a golden seat, the Adhvaryu responds ; and the king just after being anointed listens. The narrative ends with the dakšiņā : a thousand for the narrator, a hundred for him who responds ; the seats and a white mule chariot also to the Hotā. The phala- šruti declares one is absolved of all sin, and those who desire sons will get them by causing this story to be narrated. Sahasram âkhyâtre dadyâcchatam parigaritre ete caivāsane svētas cāsvatarīratho hotuh, putrakāmā hāpyākhyāpayeran labhante ha putrān labhante ha putrān // (AB 7.18). The legend as narrated by the Aitareya Brāhmaņa may now be briefly review- ed. The Rgvedic nucleus consists merely of Šunaššepa's deliverance from the pāsa (fetters) by Varuņa or may be by Agni, and eight hymns having a total of 107 verses (RV 1.24 to 30-97 verses, plus RV 9.3 having 10 - 107) have been ascribed to his seership. It is important that there is no allusion to the episode in the maņdalas of the Višvāmitras or the Vasisthas, whereas an unconnected Atreya, Rsi Sadāprņa, (RV 5.2.7) praises Agni for the great act. No wonder, the episode finds place in the Šatarcina mandala, which constitutes, so to say, the "collected works " of the centurion seers. Most, if not all, legends of the Rgveda are con- centrated in the first Mandala. So when the hymns of the Rsi Šunasšepa were put together, possibly, the redactors of the Samhitā introduced the two verses bearing Šunaššepa's name. It is clearly patchwork and the two verses, though occurring consecutively, betray a lack of logical sequence. Between the age of the Rgveda and that of the Brāhmaņa, the popular element had full sway evidently and quite a harmonious account has been presented in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa. The Šunaššepa-event as the ' middle ' part we have a begin- ning and an end tagged on. The Age represented the glorification of the Karma- kāņda, performance of sacrifices was the rule of the day. Varuņa as the Lord of 40. Witness the fate of the midmost son, again ! Madhucchandas, is called upon to submit to family interests like Šunašsepa himself. 41. Adhîyata Devarāto rikthayor ubhayor rsih / Jahnūnām cadhipatye dai ve vede ca Gāthinām // (AB 7.18). And to pursue the scholastic issue, it may be realised that the grant of the divine lore helped Sunassepa to transfer himself to the Ksatriya family. But was it not a fact that the same divine lore, of which Višvāmitra was already the proud possessor, had already elevated him to the rank and status of a Brāhmaņa ? The whole contention is thoroughly unfounded as we shall prove in the next chapter that Višvāmitra was a Rsi par excellence and belonged to an age when there HQ such distinction, when efficiency and wisdom alone poised a man to the pedestal.</page><page sequence="73">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 195 Pāsa (Pāšī) was the most powerful god, more than his grace, which was not wanting, his wrath kept all people alert. Therefore the Samhitās reverberate with prayers to appease his anger. The pact between Hariscandra and Varuņa to sacrifice even the son if he should be born, the natural disinclination to sacrifice the son - after he is born, man dodging god, the grown-up youth finding the wide world more inviting than heaven through the medium of the gallows, divine wrath, inevitable suffering and hunting for expiation, then a silver lining in the cloud - these are trends which are realistic and which have been logically worked into a fitting prologue. Even so the epilogue. Šunasšepa, by the grace of the gods, was reborn as it were, having been saved from the yüpa. To whom should he belong ? What rank should he hold? Šunasšepa himself elected to join Višvāmitra, who, true to his name, was the ' friend of all', the champion of the distressed. Certain home touches give perfection to the denoument. Visvāmitra had a hundred and one sons. Per- haps in the exuberance of his generous heart, the great sage conferred upon the god-given son all privileges of primogeniture. One's heart would melt with sym- pathy for that army of forsaken sons, a hundred and one, and specially the fifty recalcitrant ones that were cursed. But the sage who made and unmade things knew best. Vajrād api kathorāņi mrdūni kusumād api / Lokottarāņām cetāmsi ko hi vijnātum arhati //42 Inscrutable are the minds of the superior among men, harder than diamond, softer than flower ! Thus the Vedic outline of Šunasšepa having been saved from Death by the grace of the gods has developed into an elaborate narrative which has come to embody so much of mundane matter like the longing of a childless man contrasted with the despair of a prolific parent with a hundred (and one) sons, half of them recalcitrant, contrasted, again, with the helplessness of an indigent parent who is prepared in lieu of a hundred kine to surrender a son to be sacrificed at the altar, poverty painfully exaggerated to the extent of even the names being ugly and un- becoming : Šunaššepa, Šunafepuccha, Šunolāngūla, the age-long principle and process of changing over to a different family (adoption), withal, the joy of having a son, the Light of this and the other world, finally, the glorification of the sacrifice, the bounteous dakšiņā not excluded. (2) The Šānkhāyana Šrauta Sūtra repeats the legend as found in the AB, but for a few changes which are of no consequence. There are a number of verbal differences, such as are natural to dittography. (a) According to AB Rohita finds Ajïgarta in the sixth year of wandering, in the Šrauta Sūtra, in the seventh year. The benefits of wandering recited every- time by the disguised Indra communicating new ideas are lacking here ; it is almost 42, Bhavabhūti, Uttara-Rāmacarita, Act I,</page><page sequence="74">196 H- L- HARIYAPPA a repetition of the verse of the sixth peregrination : Caran vai madhu vindatyapacinvan parūsakam / Uttisthan vindate šriyam na nisat kiñcanavati //43 " Wandering he obtains honey, wandering the sweet berry, rising he obtains wealth, sitting nothing at all." Whereas, in the previous verse, the reference to the Sun's example gave a thrilling finish to the dictum of travel : Caran vai madhu vindati caran svãdum udumbaram / Süryasya pašya sremāņam yo na tandrayate caran///44 " Wandering he obtains honey, wandering the sweet figs, witness the pre-eminence of the Sun who, wandering, never tires." (b) Secondly, Ajigarta is represented as eating the son when Rohita accosted him : So'jigartam Sauyavasim rsim ašanāyāparītam putrām bhaksamāņam aranyam upeyãya /45 This should be regarded only as an instance of the moss which inevitably collects as the stream of tradition flows through different mouths. (c) Thirdly, as soon as he was set free, Šunassepa sees the " añj assava " according to Šaňkhayana, whereas he does so in the Aitareya after a magnanimous invitation from the high priests : tam rtvija ūcus tvameva no'syâhnas samsthām adhigacchetyatha haitam Šunaššepo'nj assavam dadarša //46 IV VEDIC ANCILL ARRIES (1) The Nirukta Yaska does not deal with the Šunassepa legend nor does he comment on any of the Šunassepa verses of the RV. There is however a reference47 to his being sold for price, in illustration of the practice of selling boys and girls. Discussing the question of inheritance, it is said that both the son and daughter have a right to it. Manu also supported the view.48 But some do not favour the daughter ; 43. Šānkh. ŠS.

Moreover, with regard to women, they are given away, sold or abandoned ; not so with regard to men. Here it is pointed out that these three actions relate to men also as in the case of Šunaššepa (Šaunaššepe daršanāt). The discussion concludes that a brotherless daughter has a claim for inheritance. The whole crux lies in the interpretation of RV 3.31.1, which is outside our purview. Referring thus to the fact of Šunaššepa being sold for price, Yäska adds support to the Aitareya version to that extent. Commenting on the illustration provided by Šunaššepa, Skanda and Mahe- švara explain the giving away (dāna) in the words of the AB 4 anena tvā yajã ' (Harišcandra to Varuņa), the bargain in Rohita's words to Harišcandra 4 anena ātmānam niskrīņā,' the abandonment also is told - 4 atisargo'pi Višvāmitreņa krtab. šrůyate jyãyãmso Madhucchandasab, asamaňjasaš ca Sagareņa/ (jyâyâmso ityasya sthāne jyâyaso iti pātha ucitafo/ Ed. Sarup).49 We may somehow make it out that those who were elder to Madhucchandas were abandoned by Višvāmitra. But the celebrated commentator Durgâcârya says in the same context : tathã ca parityägo'pi drstah yathâ Višvāmitreņa Madhucchanda ādīnām/50 Evidently, Durga is led by the version of the Rãmâyana, according to which the sons of Višvāmitra became as recalcitrant as the command itself was ruinous, the command being that all of them should offer themselves as victims at Ambarisa's sacrifice for the sake of Šunaššepa. They were cursed and abandoned.51 Under Nirukta II 13 relating to the synonyms of the sun and the sky, Yäska says - Athāpi Varunasyaikasya / 4 áthâ vayám Äditya vraté tavá'. This is the third line of the famous Varuņa prayer 44 Uduttamam " (RV 1.24.15) already considered in the previous pages. Both commentators Skanda-Mahešvara (joint authors) and Durga explain the full text of the verse referring to the fact of Šunaššepa pronouncing it at the sacrifice. Skanda-Mahešvara, however, add an alternative comment on behalf of the etymologists (nairuktapakse tu), which purports to the philosophic implications of the stanza.52 It implores Varuņa to liberate one from the bonds of sin committed in the three stages of life, boyhood, manhood and oldage. This is significant if it is supported by tradition, without depending upon mere fancy, for the AB has put the mantra into the mouth of the victim Šunaššepa. 49.

Thrice, in different contexts, the name of Šunaššepa occurs in the text, twice in the introductory portion and once while describing the gods of the Rgveda (1.24-30). {a) Namaskāraš Šunaššepe ñamaste astu Vidyute / (Sañkalpayannidam tulyo'ham syamiti yaducyete) // BD 1.54. The author is illustrating several technical expressions53 like stuti, prašamsā, nindā, samšaya etc. and among them namaskāra and sañkalpa. These latter are defined and examples given in this stanza. Namaskāra or homage is illustrated in the Šunaššepa formula i.e. 1.27.13. Námo mahádbhyo námo arbhakébhyo námo yúvabhyo náma ašinébhyah / yájâma devān yádi šaknāvāma mā jyayāsaš šámsamá vrksi devah //54 (b) The second reference is in connection with the order of words, which should be understood according to sense : Šunaššepam narāšamsam dyāvā nati prthiviti ca / Niraskrteti prabhrtisvarthādāsīt kramo yathä //55 In the Samhitā sometimes these words are used differently e.g. Šunaš cicchepam (5.2.7), narā vā šamsam (10.64.3), dyävä nah prthiviti ca (2.41.20) should be read as Šunaššepam cit, dyâvâ-prthivï nah, etc. The proper order of words in such cases should be determined by the sense conveyed by the context. (c) When enumerating the deities of the Šunaššepa hymns so-called, BD says - Stūyamānaš šašvad iti prïtas tu manasā dadau/ Šunaššepāya divy am tu ratham sarvam hiranmayam // BD 3.103. " Being praised with the stanza ' Šášvad índrab ' (RV 1.30.16), Indra, pleased at heart, bestowed upon Šunaššepa a celestial chariot all made of gold." Here probably Šunaššepa the Seer is meant and not the poor victim of Hariš- candra's sacrifice. Yäska does not give more details of the legend except the slender thread pointing to Šunaššepa's being sold for price. Šaunaka, author of the Brhaddevatā, follows his example and refers only to Indra's gift of the golden chariot to Šunaššepa, which need not necessarily be on 53. BD 1.33-40. 54.

It is not advisable to hypothesize, but, may it be that Yaska and Šaunaka, both of them accredited exponents of the Veda, did not much regard the colourful tapestry of the Aitareya ? After all, the legend was the outcome of the Yajñika School ; the Nairuktas had their own opinions in the matter. (3) The Sarvānukramaņī of Kâtyâyana This work affords good support to the Aitareya version. Šunassepa is here described as the son of Ajīgarta and the adopted son of Višvāmitra, being given by the gods, ājīgartih Šunaššepali sa krtrimo Vaisvāmitro devarātab.57 Hariscandra's concern in the affair is dubious. Kâtyâyana, while indexing RV 1.28, says : Yatra grāvā nava saļanustubādi yaccidhy aulûkhalyau pare mausalyau ca prajā- pater Hariscandrasyântyâ carmaprašamsā vā/58 The idea is that the last verse is of Hariscandra i.e. he is the deity thereof. The BD has Soma instead.59 But Devatānukramaņī states that the last verse praises Prajāpati Hariscandra or the carma : 6 Prajāpatim Hariscandram carma väntyä prašamsati.'60 AB however contemplates it to be a praise of Soma. Who is this Hariscandra ? Considering the meaning of the verse, Take out the remaining Soma- juice from the tray, pour it on the strainer and collect the same in the cow's hide.61 it is difficult to see which Hariscandra is to be connected with it. Lacking in relevancy, it matters little whether it is Hariscandra the sacrificing king or Pra- jāpati himself with the name Hariscandra. The verse is in the form of instruction from one priest to another priest or an assistant ; and it seems perfectly natural for Šunassepa to say it after he had pressed the Soma in a novel but quick process (añj assava). According to the accepted principle ' lingoktadevatā,' Soma must be the deity. Whatever it is, it should be noted that so far as the development of the story is concerned, the Sarvānukramaņī has yielded to the Hariscandra complex and admitted him into the legend's orbit. (4) Vāsistha Dharmašāstra This work62 which is stated to be one of the four most ancient works on Hindu Law includes Šunassepa among the various kinds of sons. They are classified 56.

Among the latter category, Šunaššepa is mentioned as an instance of two kinds viz . krita and svayamupâgata : a son who is bought for price and 4 a son who approaches by himself'. " athādāyādabandhūnām sahodha eva prathamab / yā garbhiņī samskri- yate sahodhafr putro bhavati / dattako dvitiyafr / yam mātāpitarau dadyâtãm / krītas trtïyab / tacchunaššepena vyâkhyâtam / svayamupâgatas caturthaļi / tacchunaššepena vyâkhyâtam / Šunaššepo vai yūpe niyukto devatās tustāva / tasyeha devatāķ pašam mumucus tam rtvija ūcuķ/ mamaivâyam putro'stviti tān ha na sampade / te sampadayâmasub / esa eva yam kãmayet tasya putro'stviti / tasya ha Višvāmitro hotāsīt tasya putratvam īyāyā // According to AB, as soon as the añj assava is over, Šunaššepa himself goes and sits on the lap of Višvāmitra as son. There is no reference to the discussion among the rtviks themselves to have him as son each for himself, though Sãyana amplifies the situation with this explanation. When Ajīgarta began to press his son to come back, Višvāmitra of course invites him to join his family only. It is not incorrect to call Šunaššepa as a svayamûpâgata son. Though Vasistha's Law did not entitle the son for any inheritance, he being an adãyãdabandhu, Višvāmitra out of sweet will and special favour conferred upon Šunaššepa his entire property, earthly and divine. Was not Vasistha, the author of this code, a friend of Višvāmitra ? We shall deal with this problem in the next chapter. V LATER EXPONENTS OF THE VEDA (1) Sadgurušisya Sadgurušisya who wrote and finished his commentary on Kātyāyana's Sarvā- nukramaņl in 1187 A.D.64 closely follows the Aitareya version of the Legend. Inspired with its workmanship, Sādgurušisya all at once got into a poetical vein and narrated the story in the form of verse ;65 it is a small canto of 22 stanzas. A few minor differences are inevitable in the relay. Seeing Ajigrata desirous of killing him, Šunaššepa addressed him 4 wait, I shall hasten to the gods (for protec- tion) ' - Yūpe baddhaU Šunaššepo jighāmsum pitaram tataķ / ūce tisthāham evānyā upadhāvāmi devatāķ //66 In the Aitareya, Šunaššepa never addresses him. He saw him coming with the knife and, in consternation that they would actually cut him up, soliloquises 63. Dvâdaáa ityeva putrāh purāņadrstāh / They are svayamutpãdita, ksetraja, putrikã paunarbhava, kānīna, gūdhotpanna, sahodha, dattaka, krïta, svayamupâgata, apaviddha, and sudráputřa.

Sarvā, p. 85 verse 12.</page><page sequence="79">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 201 ' hantāham de vatā upadhāvāmi '67 - alas, I shall hasten to the gods. Ajigrata must have looked a veritable fiend and it is not unnatural that Šunaššepa must have at once screamed ' stop '! Another departure, which is an improvement on the original is that he prayed, in the course of his appeal to the gods, to Indra, as well, who had already become his patron by bestowing a golden chariot upon him, well pleased with his praise - Indrām ca pūrvavyāpārasamprāptastutisupriyam / Hiranmayarathasyãpi svasmai dātāram èva ca///68 This makes it clear that the gift of the golden chariot was an earlier event. An apparent incongruity is removed by this view, because when Šunaššepa was begging for his life the giving of a chariot - may be of gold - is but a travesty of his exalted position. This we have pointed out in the last section.69 Secondly, it reveals that Šunaššepa was himself a Rsi and a favourite singer, a fact which lends support to the hypothesis that all the series of 7 hymns attributed to him were irrelevant for the occasion and that it was the handiwork of the Aitareya to weave them all into a web to suit its own purpose. (2) Säyana Though so much was written by Säyana in the shape of commentary to the hymns of the Veda, as well as to the Aitareya Brāhmaņa, he has not said anything which would contribute to the historical study of the legend. In the RV, rather contrary to his wont, he does not even narrate the story in this own words. He adheres to the task of quoting his authorities, chief of whom is Kâtyâyana, while introducing every sūkta and also specific verses when necessary. In this case, he quotes from the Aitareya Brāhmaņa also, a work on which he wrote his own commentary. When the authorities differed from one another, he faithfully reproduces all of them : e.g. the discussion70 about the devatā of RV 1.28.9, wherein he quotes all the sources. " ucchistam ityasyâfr Harišcandrādhisavaņacarmasomānām anyatamo devatā." It may be remembered that the Brhaddevatā provided the alternative between adhisavaņacarma and soma ; whereas the Sarvānukramaņi following the Devatānu- kramaņī considered Hariscandra as the deity. The best thing for Säyana was of course to record all the evidence and leave it at that which he has done. (3) Dyā Dviveda Dyā Dviveda's Nitimañjari (written 1494 A.D.) is only a replica of the picture given by the older authors, in this case, Kâtyâyana, Sadgurusisya and Säyana. 67. AB 7.16. 68. Sarvã, p. 85 verse 14. 69. Supra n. 56. 70. Supra p.</page><page sequence="80">202 H- L- hariyappa From the first-mentioned authority the author quotes the index ; from the second, the poetical narrative, and from the third the explanation of the Rgvedic mantras.71 The main purpose of Dyā is however to illustrate certain ethical maxims from the Vedic events. It was elsewhere observed that our author has not performed well in that respect. His dicta are unimpressive and his examples open to question. Šunaššepa provides the ground for this observation : Pitarau vandyau ityâha - Pitarau hi sadā vandyau na tyajed aparādhinau / Pitrā baddhab Šunaššepo yayãce pitrdaršanam //72 ' Parents always deserve respect ; they should not be forsaken though guilty. Bound by the very father, Šunaššepa begged for a sight of the father (parents).' The Rgevedic verse quoted in support is the famous ' kašya nünám ' (1.24.1) which ends with ' pitáram ca drséyam mâtáram ca,' which is the refrain of the next verse also. Enough has been said above to show at once that such moralisations do not at all appeal. In the present case, the interpretation of the last line of the Rgvedic verse just quoted, as conceived by Dyā is far from convincing. In fact, it is wrong ; Šunaššepa could not and did not wish to see once again the parents who gave him birth. He was longing, on the other hand, to find on this earth, real affectionate parents. He found them, indeed, in Visvāmitra. Another lesson. Devānām api stutih priyetyâha - Aisvaryaparipûrno'pi dadyât stutyâpi cepsitam / Šunašsepāya sauvarņam ratham Indrafr stuto dadau //73 ' A man endowed with riches, being praised, should give what is desired ; Indra, being praised, gave a golden chariot to Šunaššepa '. The moral, unfortunately, is not couched in clear terms. The versification reminds one of the proverbial versifiers of Bhoja's Court.74 Suffice it to say, that both the lesson and the example lack the pithiness or the ' sting', which is the very soul of an epigram. Before concluding this section, it must be observed, with a sense of surprise also that these veteran writers have not been drawn away by the Epic and Purāņic versions of the legend. Their business was however specific, that is only to explain a given text. It is perfectly tactful and necessary for the commentator to confine himself to his province. But how could the great epics, specially the Râmãyana (which gives a different version of the story), and the Purāņas like the Bhāgavata withhold their influence on these learned savants ? They were able to visualise a discipline which was more than fifteen centuries old in their time. The Epics 71. He has mentioned other authorities as well viz.

And seeing the other end of knowledge which was fourteen-fold (caturdasa vidyâfr) was every man's goal in those times. The matter deserves some thought. VI RÂMÂYANA The Rãmãyana75 records the Šunassepa legend in a very different form. The story is related by the sage Šatānanda, son of Gautama, to Šrī Rāma at a sacrifice which king Janaka was clebrating at Mithilā and to which Visvāmitra took Rāma and Laksmaņa to witness the great occasion. The guests were accorded a most respectful welcome by the King. After exchanging courtesies, Janaka's principal priest Šatānanda was pleased to hear of Rāma's visit to the hermitage of his revered father Gautama and of the redemption of the mother, Ahalyâ who was under a curse. This happy event was due to the favour of Visvāmitra who brought Rāma along. Naturally Šatānanda was overwhelmed with affection and regard for the young prince and a sense of gratitude to Visvāmitra, the universal friend. This prompted him to recount all the great deeds of Visvāmitra before the Prince, who listened with wonder and admiration. Šunassepa's deliverance was one of the series. Once upon a time Visvāmitra was practising severe penance at the Puskara in the western regions of our country. At the same time king Ambarisa of Ayodhya started a sacrifice. The victim (pasu) was carried away by Indra, causing a serious breach in the performance. The priest accused the king of carelessness and, in atonement, proposed that either the stolen victim should be recovered or a human victim secured instead. The king made an elaborate search all over the country, towns and forests and even the holy hermitages. He was prepared to buy a human being paying a huge ransom, if such should be available. At length on the heights of the Bhrgu mountain, he met the great sage Rcīka seated with his wife and sons. He applied to him for one of his sons in lieu of a hundred thousand kine. The father said he was unwilling to part with the eldest son and the mother declined to let go the youngest, her darling Šunaka. Thereupon, Šunassepa, the middle one, himself said 6 Father says the eldest is not for sale, and mother says the youngest is not for sale ; the middle one is meant for sale, I think. So, Prince, take me'. Ambarisa was delighted, gave away crores of gold and heaps of precious stones, along with a hundred thousand kine, and went away with Šunas- sepa mounted on his chariot.76 75.

L. HARIYAPPA At noon, the party halted at the Puskara for rest. There Šunassepa saw his maternal uncle Višvāmitra engaged in penance, along with other sages. With sorrowful face, thirsty and exhausted, he fell at the sage's feet and appealed for succour in pathetic terms. Consoling him in so many words, the great sage Višvāmitra, an ocean of kindness, commanded his sons to offer themselves as victims at king Ambarisa's sacrifice instead of Šunasšepa. Then the sons, Madhucchandas and others retorted " How do you forsake, O Sire, your own sons to save another man's son ? We think it is improper like dog's flesh in the dish." Furious at this disobedient reply, Višvāmitra cursed the sons for a thousand years of life on earth eating dog's flesh like the sons of Vasistha. Turning round to the pitiful Šunaššepa, he instructed him " When you are bound to the holy yûpa by means of thread after being decked with red garlands and unguents, just address Agni and sing two songs (gāthās). You will succeed." He taught him the gathās. Šunaš- šepa having learnt them with due attention went pleased and urged Ambarīsa to resume the journey. So they reached the capital.

Thus bound, Šunassepa praised in exquisite terms the two gods Indra and his brother (Visņu) as already instructed. The thousand-eyed one was pleased with this intimate appeal and granted him long life. The sacrifice was duly concluded and king Ambarisa derived manifold benefit by the grace of Indraš And Visvāmitra continued his penance at the Puskara for ten hundred years. Thus we see that the Rãmãyana appears to represent a tradition which differs much from the Aitareya. Whereas in the latter, king Harišcandra, on account of his son Rohita, tried to sacrifice in order to appease Varuņa's anger, Šunassepa son of Ajigarta, here in the Rãmãyana king Ambarisa, on account of the sacrificial victim being stolen by Indra, tries to sacrifice, in general propitiation of the gods, Šunassepa, son of Rcika.

L. HARIYAPPA comes on the scene only at the sacrifice as one of the officiating priests: in the other, Višvāmitra is the maternal uncle of Sunašsepa and enters the story even before the sacrifice but does not attend it ; he also teaches him two gāthās whose recitation at the proper time will prevent his death. The revolt and degrada- tion of the sons also precede the sacrifice in the Rãmãyana, while the same occurred after in the Aitareya. Of 101 sons, 51 of whom Madhucchandas was leader, obeyed the father's command to accept Šunaššepa's primogeniture. But in the Rãmãyana all the sons,77 even the good Madhucchandas were concerned in the revolt and its consequences ; and what was the command which was disobeyed ? It was that in order to save one soul i.e. Šunaššepa's, all the sons should offer themselves as victims at the sacrifice. Ajīgarta sold Sunašsepa, as he was driven to the pitch by his indigence, but Rcika seems to have had enough and to spare, he must have made up his mind to spare a son also out of deference to the wishes of the great king who came to the door for help. The Aitareya depicts Sunašsepa as the god- given son of Visvāmitra, who adopted him into his family, formally also giving him the privileges of the first born. We saw how this fitted into the Vedic tradition in a wider application of the term. The Rãmãyana provides no indication of what happened to Šunaššepa afterwards. Perhaps he went to penance as he expressed himself when he sought Višvāmitra's help (1.62.6). This section cannot be concluded without referring to some far-reaching differ- ences in reading - and therefore, in import - between the Bombay edition of the Rãmãyana and that brought out by the Italian scholar G. Gorresio in 1843-67 (Bengal Recension).

Compare Keith's remarks on p. 64 of his Rig-Veda Brāhmaņas Translated (HOS Vol. 25, 1920). He says if the gāthās introduced by the AB are taken by themselves there is no ques- tion of division among the sons. The division into first fifty as one group and the second fifty with the midmost Madhucchandas as leader of the other group is, in his opinion, perhaps, the handiwork of the Aitareya. There is some sense in this, at any rate, because Madhucchandas of Rgvedic fame is exonerated.</page><page sequence="85">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 207 {a) It is said that Ambarisa was out to perform a human sacrifice and Indra carried away the victim : 44 Tasya vai yajamânasya naramedhena bhūpateh Proksitam mantravad yūpāt pašům Indro jahāra tam / " 1.63.678 The Bombay edition does not specify which pasu it was, but the priest says 4 Search for the stolen pašu or bring a human victim instead'.

But our Rcïka is a maharsi, dazzling with penance, accompanied by wife and sons on the heights of the Bhrgu mountain (1.61.11,12 text quoted above in a footnote). (c) The revolt of the sons is expressed in different terms : 44 Katham ātmasutān hitvā trātā parasutān asi Bhagavan kâryametat te svamâmsasyeva bhaksaņam " / 1.64.14 The difference is only between sva-māmsa and šva-māmsa ! It is just possible that šva-māmsa 4 dog's flesh ' is meant, not 4 own (sva) flesh'. The confusion between s and š in Bengali pronunciation is understandable. Cf. šāntvayitvā for sãntvayitvã. The Vāsisthas were cursed to eat dog's flesh. There also Gorresio reads as svamāmsa.80 The degradation was, from Vedic times, attached to eating dog's flesh. The great sage Vāmadeva famished by hunger cooked the entrails of a dog.81 It is common parlance to call a shabby fellow as švapaca. In the Purāņas we meet with references which say that in times of famine the condition of some of these sages was so straitened that the whole family subsisted on dog's flesh :82 The matter did not call for such discussion had not the alternative been most tragic and verily, unthinkable - eating one's own flesh and yet living ! 83 78. The two cantos here are 63 and 64, whereas in the Bombay Edition, they are 61 and 62. Verbal differences in reading are numerous, but only those that indicate a factual change have been considered. The first kāņda is called Ādikāņda whereas we are familiar with the name Bālakāņda.

Later, Sa baddha rgbhis tustāva devendram harivāhanam Bhāgārthinam anuprāptam svareņoccair vinädayan / Ibid. 25. Šunassepa praised Indra with verses from the Rgveda. According to our text, Visvāmitra provided raksā first i.e. by chanting some spells and then taught him two gāthās. The instruction was, also, that he should first address himself to Agni, which fact peculiarly corresponds with the Vedic version. First he ran to Prajāpati (ka) and then to Agni, later on to Indra. 83A Varuna the real god concerned is neglected by either version. Some scholars84 attach much importance that, accord- ing to Gorresio, Visvāmitra taught Šunassepa only one mantra, whereas in the Bombay book it is two gāthās. It is not necessarily one stanza only, because, later in the same text, the reference is amplified as ' rgbhis tustāva ' i.e. praised with several verses from the Rgveda. The same may apply to the two gāthās. Let us remember that the AB puts 97 verses into the victim's mouth and make him knock at the door of this, that and every god ! VII MAHÄBHÄRATA (1) The Anusāsana-parva of the Mahābhārata describes the exploits of Visvāmitra in these words : deliverance of Šunassepa was, of course, one of them - Rcïkasyâtmajas cai va Šunašsepo mahātapāhL Vimoksito mahāsatrāt pasūtām apyupâgatah / Hariscandrakratau devāms tosayitvātmatejasā Putratām anusamprāpto Visvâmitrasya dhīmatafr / Nâbhivâdayate jyestham Devarātam narādhipa Putrāfr pancāsad evāpi šaptāfr švapacatām gatāfr /85 A man of great austerities, Šunassepa, son of Rcïka, was liberated (by Visvāmitra) from the sacrifice, though bound as the victim. And he, in that sacrifice performed by Harišcandra, pleased the gods by his own brilliance and became the son of the wise Visvāmitra. But the fifty sons all of them, would not greet Devarāta (Šunas- sepa) as the eldest and, hence, were cursed to the state of cooking dog's flesh. 83A. AB VII.6, RV 1.24.1 and 2. 84.

It is difficult to say which exactly is responsible for this, whether the foregoing story given in the Rām. or the one from the Mbh. just recapitulated. The relative ages of the two epics are admittedly hard to determine. A period covering centuries, during which the epics might have taken their present shape only, has been postulated. Thus, according to Winternitz, " between the 4th century b.c. and the 4th century a.D. the trans- formation of the epic Mahābhārata into our present compilation took place, pro- bably gradually... Small alterations and additions still continued to be made how- ever even in later centuries. One date of the Mahābhārata does not exist at all, but the date of every part must be determined on its own account."86 Concluding the discussion on the age of Rām., Winternitz says : " The whole Rämäyana, including the later portions was already an old and famous work when the Mahābh- ārata had not yet attained its present form. It is probable that the Rāmāyaņa had its present extent and contents as early as towards the close of the 2nd century A.D. The older nucleus of the Mahābhārata, is probably older than the ancient Rāmāyaņa...It is probable that the original Rämäyana was composed in the third century b.c. by Vālmiki on the basis of ancient ballads."87 What was said of the Mbh., that the date of every part must be determined on its own account, well applies to the Rām. also. For in the first place, the first and the seventh books of the latter viz. the Bāla. and Uttara kāņdas respectively are accepted as later addi- tions, and even in the Bāla kāņda, the story of Rsyasrñga, the exploits of Visvāmitra the account of the dwarf incarnation of Visņu, the descent of the Ganges, the churning of the ocean etc. - are all agglutinative in character. Special care there- fore becomes necessary to fix the relative chronology of those legends which are common to both the epics. All theorisations are perforce tentative until critical editions of both works, after the fashion of the Bori Mahābhārata,88 are made available. Ignorance, wanton or otherwise, of this important factor would result 86. Winternitz HIL p. 475 (1927). 87. Ibid. pp. 516-517. 88. It is well-known how this stupendous undertaking by the BORI has succeeded in pushing though about half of the Great Epic. The work is published upto the end of Bhīsma parva. This crowning glory of critical scholarship in India was achieved by the late Dr. Visņu Sītārām Sukthankar, who by dint of vision and dynamic activity enunciated the principles of textual criticism and evolved a perfect process of manuscript collation and editorial collaboration. For full seventeen years he was so deep in the Mbh. which was to him a universe by itself, that he had unconsciously attained sublime identification (Sârûpya) with Maharsi Vyasa when, at the end of his memorable, but, alas, portentous preface, he recalled Ürdhvabähur viraumyesa na ca kas cicchinoti mām Dharmād arthas ca kāmaš ca sa kimartham na se vy ate // " Across the reverberating corridors of Time, we, his descendants heard his clarion call to Duty." Such was his realisation : A critical edition of the Rämäyana has been promised by Dr. Raghu Vira (p. 390 Sukthankar Memorial Edition, Vol.1, Critical Studies in the Mahābhārata, 1944). When the two critical editions are in hand, a historical and comparative study of the legends will be placed on a secure basis. At present we have to be satisfied with the comparative aspect only not the historical, as far as it is possible.</page><page sequence="88">210 H. L. HARIYAPPA in very fallacious conclusions. A few instances have been convincingly described by the late Dr. Sukthankar in his Epic Studies VIII which is a text-critical essay on the Rāmopākhyāna, occurring in the Äranyaka-parva. Professors Jacobi and Oldenberg have been proved to be victims of hasty generalisations based on passages of uncertain veracity.89 In the light of the above remarks, some observations of a purely comparative nature, not stressing on chronological sequence, may be recorded. Taking shelter under Winternitz's conclusion that the present text of the Rām. was a fact at the close of 2nd century a.D., while Mbh. attained that state by the 4th, apart from the immemorial tradition of Rām. being the First Poem (âdikâvya) that was composed, the section on Rām. has been placed earlier. Now to come back to the story of Šunassepa. Šunaššepa is the son of Rcika : this is a point common to both Rām. and Mbh. The sacrifice is undertaken by Hariscandra : this is one with the Aitareya. Višvāmitra's sons were fifty only and all of them were cursed (Mbh.). Rām also says similarly though, however, it does not exactly estimate his prolific achievements. AB credits him with a hundred and one, of whom the first fifty were cursed. It is to be observed that the narration of Visvāmitra's deeds, which were so many, was the main purpose of the Mbh. context. Therefore the Šunassepa incident is given in bare outline. If the poet had entered into details, there should have been a clearer rendering, so that we could discern a harmonious trend. (2) Harivamsa - This work is regarded as part of the Mahābhārata, but outside the pale of the traditional 18 parvans. It is a kind of appendix (khila or parisista) for the great epic, which was a convenient and accommodating re- ceptacle for all lore of the country. With regard to such works it is not a useful attempt to scrutinize the authenticity or genuineness of this portion or that ; nor is it useful to determine the age or date of their composition. They are intended for the edification of the common folk on whose minds, only the narrated events exert an influence rather than the academic aspects of date and authorship. In such a swollen stream of legendary matter, as the Mahābhārata, currents and cross currents, pools and whirlpools pass muster, and the inquirer runs the risk of being caught and lost amidst them. Here is an example : The Šunassepa story given in the Harivamsa, which is the nineteenth parva so to say, is so incoherent with that told in the Anusāsana which is the thirteenth parva. Says the Harivamsa90 - Višvāmitrātmajānām tu Šunaššepo'grajafr smrtab / Bhārgavaft Kaušikatvam hi prāptaķ sa munisattamaķ / 89. SME Vol. 1, (1944), pp. 388 f, fn. 4 on p. 389, $0.

It happened this way that at the sacrifice instituted by Haridasva,91 Šunaššepa had been yoked as a pašu ; then he became Višvāmitra's son, for, the gods (having granted life to the victim) made him over to Višvāmitra. Hence he got the name Devarāta (god-given). Devarāta and others are seven sons92 of Višvāmitra, and through Drsadvati also a son called As taka. Šunaššepa's pedigree is also different, it is an interesting revelation. He was the sage Rcika's son all right, and the middle one too, but placed between Jamadagni the elder and Sunafrpuccha93 the younger brother : The chapter under review gives the whole genealogy, consistent in itself - Kušika (fifth in line from Jahiiu) Bhrgu Gādhi I i i Rcika - married - Satyavati Višvāmitra I Devarāta and others. i rr ; i Jamadagni Šunaššepa Sunafrpuccha94 I Parašurāma. King Gādhi gave his daughter Satyavati in marriage to Rcika, son of Bhrgu. Rcika was pleased with his wife and prepared the holy caru for the sake of a son 91. This is neither Harišcandra (AB), nor Ambarīsa (Rām.) : 92. Višvāmitra's sons defy all attempts at enumeration ! Book to book the number changes ranging from 7 to 101. In this very chapter (Hari. 1.27) the sum of seven is mentioned but the list comes up in all to 14 at least. That he was a prolific parent is acknowledged everywhere. Mbh. 13.4 counts 62 sons.

L. H ARI YAPP A to himself and also one to his father-in-law Gādhi on request. Both parts of the caru, he handed to his wife Satyavati pointing out which she should take and which her mother. Somehow at the time of partaking the sacred viands, the mother gave away her portion to the daughter. As Satyavati conceived, Rcīka, by divine instinct, discovered the mistake. In his dispensation, the caru that was meant for the mother-in-law was to produce a strong and valiant son, invincible and conquering all Ksatriyas, and that for his wife was to produce a most eminent sage, wise in thought and serene in temperament. That was just right. But fate turned the tables.95 Satyavati was sad, because she at all events preferred a saintly son to a redoubtable warrior ; such a one was fitting for her father who was a king. Therefore she begged her consort, the sage Rcīka to change the progeny even then, for what is it that is impossible for a divine sage who can make and unmake things ? She proposed an alternative also lest she should offend her revered husband - ' Confer upon me a saintly son only ; if inevitable, let his son be of the warrior kind'. Rcika was moved by his beloved's fervent prayer and at once granted it. Thus was born the sage Jamadagni.96 As the result of the other protion of the sacred caru, the sage Višvāmitra was born.97 But how to reconcile the legend of Rcīka having three sons of whom Šunassepa was the middle one ? The author of the Harivamša, whoever it is, simply appended that series of three brothers to this illustrious Bhrgu line substituting Jamadagni's name for the eldest ! 98 We have occasion to say elsewhere that except the name of Šunassepa, the series of Šuna-names are spurious. At any rate the latter do not fit in with the context. We may at worst resort to the convenient theory of several persons of the same name. The Rcīkas are different, the father of a Jamadagni and the brother-in-law of a Višvāmitra being -poles apart from the Rcīka who sold a son for price. VIII PURĀŅAS (1) Brãhma This Purāņa" is always stated first in the list of eighteen mahā-purāņas and hence sometimes called Ādi-Purāņa. Looking into the contents, however, it is 95. The story is related in Mbh. 13.4 with slight elaboration here and there. The change of caru was due to the mischief of Satyavatťs mother who did not scruple to play fraud on her own daughter. 96.

HIL p. 531 The eariier Purāņas must have, according to the Professor, come into being before the 7th century A.D. (p. 525). This always rules out the interpolations which are a menace to a systematic appreciation of the Purāņas.</page><page sequence="91">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 213 revealed that only a very small portion of it could be called ancient. Glorification of several holy places on the Ganges is a special feature of this Purāņa. The Šunašsepa legend100 is described in the Gautamî-mâhâtmya (chs. 70-175), which is a glorification of the sacred places on the Ganges. Sages Nārada and Parvata once visited the Iksvāku king Harišcandra. Wondering as to why all creatures under creation hanker after progeny, the king sought enlightenment at their hands, being himself childless. They replied suitably and advised him : " Go to the sacred Gautami (holy place) and worship Varuņa. He will grant your wish." The king obeyed, Varuņa pleased by his worship, granted his request on condition that he would sacrifice to him the very son that would be born. Hari- šcandra agreed and returned to the capital. But after the child was actually born, the king was so overwhelmed with paternal love that he, almost in the manner related in AB, put off discharging his duty by the God. At last the young Prince, Rohita, was sixteen and fit to be Crown Prince, when Varuņa came for the last time and insisted on his due. The king summoned the Prince in the presence of ministers and priests and told him all the history of his birth and the imminent sacrifice. But the youth sharply retorted : " Wait, I shall first sacrifice to Visņu, Lord of the Worlds, with Varuņa as pasu (victim), the priests shall help me in this."101 Varuņa was enraged and cursed the king with dropsy. Rohita went to the forest ; five years elapsed and during the sixth, Rohita came to the same holy spot on the Ganges where his father had worshipped Varuņa. There he met Ajïgarta, son of sage Vayas,102 followed by wife and three sons. Getting acquainted with him in a casual manner, he bargained for Šunasšepa in lieu of a thousand cows, besides grain, gold and cloth. Rohita then went to the father and told him to offer to Varuņa the sage's son who was bought for price. Then, what is strange, Harišcan- dra refused to sacrifice the brāhmaņa : " Having made them (Brāhmaņas) victims, I am not anxious to live a pitiful life. It is not fair, death is preferable to making the twice-born a sacrificial victim. Go therefore, my son, happily with the Brāhmaņa." At this time was heard the Voice from Heaven : " O king of kings go to the sacred Gautami with Rohita, the priests and with the son of the Brāhamņa. There celebrate the sacrifice without killing Šunassepa, and the sacrifice will still be complete." 100. Brahma-Purāņa. ÄnSS. No. 28 (1895) ch. 104 (pp. 246-295) and ch. 150 (p. 361 f.) 101.

The sarcasm behind 4 pašunā ' is irresistible ! 102. 4 Rses tu Vayasah sutam'. According to Vedic texts he is 4 Sauyavasi ' i.e. son of Sûyavas. How patent the error in text-transmission or of legendary tradition ! It could easily be 4 Rses sûyavasas sutam ". No. v.l. for the Purāņa reading. But a later chapter (150) has Suyavasyatmajo loke' jigartiriti višrutah ; the line may point to the name being 4 Suyavasya ' taking the whole as a compound. There is a v.l. 4 suyajñasyatmajo ' in this context. Illustrative of Purāņic license if not vagary is that the name Ajïgarta is here Ajīgarti twice after final e and o (Sk. 86) with initial a elided, and finally (four times) as simply Jïgarti, the initial a being dropped perhaps on the analogy of Bhāguri's Law.</page><page sequence="92">214 H. L. H ARI YAPP A Then the king repaired to the banks of the Ganges with the priest Vasistha, the sages Višvāmitra and Vāmadeva. The sacrifice was performed in regular manner. At the proper time, Višvāmitra addressed the Assembly and the Gods. " Pray, permit all of you, the gods severally to whom he as oblation is due (to be sacrificed), - permit this Šunaššepa (to be free). Foremost of the Vipras, may he bathe in the sacred Gautamī and offer prayer to the gods, whereby they shall be pleased." With the approval of the assembly, Šunaššepa bathed in the sacred river and praised the gods who declared : " This sacrifice is complete without killing Šunaššepa." (kratuļi pūrņo bhavatyesah Šunaššepavadham vinā). Varuņa was specially pleased. Višvāmitra honoured Šunaššepa before the Assem- bly and adopted him as his son and made him the eldest, taking precedence over his other sons. Those who did not accept his priority were cursed and those who acquiesced were blessed. All this happened on the south bank of the Gautamī. Innumerable are the holy places (8014) thereat,103 they being named after Hari- šcandra, Šunaššepa, Višvāmitra, Rohita and so on. This Purāņa in a later chapter (150) describes how in another tirtha called Paišāca, a vipra was freed from a ghostly existence. That vipra is no other than our Ajīgarta (or Jïgarti as the text transforms him), who merited that punishment because he sold his middle son Šunaššepa to a Ksatriya for being sacrificed. During life, he suffered severe illness, after death was subjected to untold punishments in Hell and finally was turned into a ghost. Šunaššepa once, while passing that way, heard a deep groaning sound, on tracing which he was told by the ghost, the miserable punishment it was fated to suffer. Šunaššepa was stricken with sorrow, bathed in the Gautamī and offered watery oblation104 to the father (pitr). Ajīgrata was absolved of the sin and ascended heaven. While this account of the Brahma Purāņa corresponds in all significant details with the AB, the deliverance of Šunaššepa is effected in a peculiar manner. This poetical innovation is natural to an age which looked upon sacrifices, particularly the human sacrifice, with horror. The sacrificial age had been substituted by an age which believed in washing off all sins in the holy waters of the Ganges. So all stories naturally converge into this doctrine which appealed to the common people whose outlook, with time and tide, had totally changed. Ajīgarta's redemp- tion is, of course, a novelty. (2) Vãyu Purāņa The version of the Šunaššepa story given here105 fully accords with that given in Harivamša,106 but for the substitution of Haridašva for Harišcandra which, 103. ityâdyastasahasrâni tîrthânyatha caturdaša / 104. For the moment, the Purāņa does not mind the incongruity of Sunassepa offering tarpana for one who was no longer father to him ! 105. BI ed. Mitra (1888) Vol. II, ch. 29 st. 89-92. 106. But Narahari that VP follows Mbh. It was more proper to say Vāyu Purāņa and Harivamša bear all identity except the name Haridasva, which is but oversight on the part of the author of Harivamša. A look into the original texts and the accompanying conspectus will convince.</page><page sequence="93">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 215 clearly, is an oversight. Most of the verses are common to both. It is not easy to say which of the two was the borrower. Vayu Purāņa is assigned to an age107 earlier than the celebrated Bāna (early 7th cent.), who heard the Purāņa read to him, and later than the Gupta period (4th and 5th cent.) which is described in the Purāņic text. Which then is the date of Harivamsa which is a complement to the Mahābhārata ? As already remarked quite a wide period of time has been suggested i.e. 4th cent. B.C. to 4th cent. A.D., during which the Great Epic of India took shape so as to comprehend ' the present extent, contents and character'. Even then, allowance must be given for small alterations and additions which continued to be made in later centuries. It will be nearer truth if we think that both Vayu Purāņa and Harivamsa owe to a common source, may be in this case Mahābhārata. ( 3 ) Bhägavata Purāņa This Purāņa108 which is ascribed to the 10th cent. A.D. by Winternitz109 and to the 9th by C. V. Vaidya and others, narrates the Šunaššepa legend in two contexts. The first part of it up to his deliverance from the stakes is related in connection with Hariscandropâkhyâna,110 as the sacrifice was celebrated under the aegis of that king. The second part viz. his adoption into the Višvāmitra family is narrated in what is called Parasurāmopākhyāna.m The story of Višvāmitra comes there naturally as the two heroes Parašurāma and Višvāmitra are closely related as members of one family. For as shown in the previous section (see genealogical table), Parasurāma's grandmother Satyavatï is Višvāmitra's sister. The two narrations put together fully and accurately reproduce the version of AB, the difference being only in the vehicle of expression. The Brāhmaņa is a mixture of Vedic prose and the gāthā while the Purāņa is entirely in the sloka ; still, there is so much of verbal correspondence that it is only fair to say that the author of the Purāņa has rewritten the AB in the form of verse, with the ancient text acutally before him.112 But one change, and that for the better perhaps, 107. Winternitz HIL 1, pp. 553-554. 108. Ed. Eugene Burnouf (Paris 1847). A beautiful but incomplete edition. Only nine skandhas have been published in three volumes. Burnouf's valuable introduction to the Bhäga- vata Purāņa has been profusely quoted by scholars. He is highly praised by Max Müller as a great teacher. It was inspiration derived from this savant that prompted M.M. to conceive, under- take and bring out the famous edition of the Rgveda with Säyana's commentary. The closing paragraph of M.M's preface to the second volume of the first edition reveals both the teacher and the pupil. " When I heard of his death," M.M. records, " I felt - and I believe that many engaged in similar studies shared the feeling - as if our work had lost much of its charm and its purpose. 4 What will Burnouf say ? ' was my earliest thought, on completing the first volume of the Rgveda. And now, as I am finishing the second, in its turn submitted to the judgment of so many scholars whose friendship I value and whose learning I admire, my thoughts turn again to him who is no longer among us, and I think, not without sadness, of what his judgment would have been." 1853, pp. xl-xli of Vol. I, Second Edition, 1890. Gorresio, Roth, Goldstücker, M. M. and several others were fellow-students under Burnouf. 109. Winternitz. HIL (Calcutta Univ. 1927) Vol. I, p. 556, and n. 3 same page. 110. Ed. Burnouf.

Indra who was pleased with the sacrifice gave the golden chariot to Harišcandra, and not to Šunassepa as told in the AB. That it is a weak spot in the Aitareya construction has already been discussed.113 The Bhāgavata adds support to the view.114 (4) Devī Bhāgavata The claim of this work to be classed among the eighteen main Purāņas has not been granted,115 perhaps reasonably, judging from the prolixity of its style ad nauseam, not to speak of the kind of subject-matter which marks the extreme into which a narrator's license can carry. The Šunašsepakhyana is here told in no less than 4 chapters116 making a total of 239 slokas. One feature is that in the bare outline it has not much strayed from the ancient source the Aitareya. The personal- ities are almost all the same, the motifs are the same. But the haltings at every step to elaborate a detail with unbridled fantasy have rendered the narrative heavy, sometimes the serenity of the story has been rudely disturbed, so much so that it verges on absurdity e.g. Harišcandra's bargaining with Varuņa and the behaviour of this august divinity of the Veda, Supreme Lord of Law and Order, as depicted in this work, provide more of amusement than of high ideals like a stern sense of duty by the God or by the ancestors. The conversations117 between the king and the God remind one of a bargaining in which the common folk indulge. To give another instance, when the sacrifice was afoot118 with Šunašsepa bound to the stakes, it is neither tragedy nor a holy sacrifice that the book describes. The sacrifice converts itself into a rabble and a melodrama. For a historical study of the legend, however, the work provides valuable material. It illustrates the part the narrator's fancy plays in the growth or transformation of a legend. And, as such works are composed for the sake of readers or listeners, they easily betray the level of culture and the standard of taste which the people had attained or to which they had descended. Now a few details. {a) Hariscandra does penance on the banks of the Ganges to appease Varuņa, by the advice of Vasistha, his family priest. That Nārada did not appear in such a recent work is rather strange. 113. See supra section 3. 114.

Each time Varuņa is put off, the period of advantage gained is more ; the arguments are quite ingenious but not high in taste. Thus after the birth of a child the father is purified in ten days but the mother is fit for rites, only after a month ; so the God was put off for one month. Then the teeth should appear. Then the boy deserves to have his hair-cut (caula). The fourth round is won on the pretext of upanayana (Initiation to Study) and the fifth by samāvartana (Return from Study). On the sixth round, Rohita escaped to the forest even without the knowledge of the father.119 Wrathful at this, Varuņa cursed the king to suffer from dropsy (jalodara). (c) Rohita learning of the father's illness wants to return to the capital. But Indra, in the form of an old vipra, advises him to stay away on a most ludicrous argument, unworthy of a god : ' Life is dear to all creatures. On account of life only, the wife and children become dear. In order to protect his life, the king will kill you at the sacrifice and get cured of his illness. Therefore you should not go back to the father's house. When the father is dead, then only you will go for the sake of obtaining the kingdom.120 Again and again, the divine lord appeared and prevented Rohita by means of ingenious arguments, from getting back to his place. (d) Harišcandra goes again to Vasistha seeking advice as to what to do to cure the illness. He advises : 4 Perform sacrifice by means of a son bought for price, then the curse will end '. The king sent the ministers in search of a son to buy. Šunašsepa was bought off for a hundred cows from Ajīgarta who was living in penury. (e) When the victim was tied to the sacrificial post there was great commotion in the assembly. Šunasšepa himself was weeping. The Šamitr (the killer of the sacrificial animal) refused to do his duty which was on this occasion too cruel to bear. Ajīgarta came forward to perform the act for double the fee. All were struck aghast ; they began to curse Ajīgarta : Pišāco'yam mahāpāpī krūrakarmā dvijākrtih Yas tvayam svasutam hantum udyatafr kulapāmsanah. /m At this stage Visvāmitra intervened and pleaded before the king to release the victim, as it was not fair to cut up another body in order to save his own. The king refused to honour his proposal. Then Visvāmitra went up to Šunassepa and taught him the Vāruņa-mantra which the latter recited with all devotion. Varuņa was pleased and arrived on the scene. Harišcandra begged his mercy for the whole medley and Varuņa permitted him to let go the boy. 119. According to AB, Rohita was apprised of the situation in Varuņa's presence after he became fit to wear armour, upon which, he refused to submit to sacrifice and went away to forest, bow in hand. 120. Ch. 16. 7-9. Ibid. 121. Ch. 16. 34. Ibid.</page><page sequence="96">218 H. L. HARIYAPPA (/) Now another coloured thread is woven into the texture. The released Šunašsepa addresses the sacrificial assembly ! 6 O gentlemen of omniscient know- ledge ! whose son am I now ? Who is my father hereafter ? With your verdict, I shall resort to him for protection'. Putro'ham kasya sarvajnab pitā me ko'gratab param Bha vatam vacanāt tasya saraņam pravrajãmyaham /122 The members said : ' Of whom else would he be the son, when he is Ajigarta's progeny?' The sage Vāmadeva : "No." He was sold for price and the king bought him, so he belongs to the king, undoubtedly. Or, he should belong to Varuna, as he released him from the bonds. For, five kinds are the fathers as they say : Annadātā bhayatrâtâ tathā vidyâpradas ca yah Tathā vittapradaš caiva pañcaite pitarafr smrtāķ / 123 There was a deadlock when the god's name was brought into competition. But Vasistha gave a reasonal judgment : " When the father, devoid of affection, sold the son, he ceased to be that for, he got wealth instead. The king acquired him no doubt, but he forfeited his claim when he offered him to the gods by yoking him to the post, and he has derived benefit also. Nor does Šunašsepa belong to Varuņa, who released him only after being pleased with his praise ". So, Kausikasya sutas câyam ariste yena raksitah Mantram datvā mahâvïryam Varunasyatisañkate /124 4 He becomes the son of Kaušika who saved him from calamity by imparting a powerful mantra in praise of Varuņa'.125 Members of the assembly immediately approved of the decision. Šunasšepa went over to Višvāmitra, who held him by the right hand and took him home at once (satvara^). Varuņa, pleased, went to his abode. And all went to their own houses : 126 122. 17.22.

The incident after all is one, it did not happen to two or more Šunaššepas, nor did it occur in two or more places. Therefore while employing expressions like version and recension which are almost becoming technical with the advance of critical scholarship, some care requires to be exercised. Should we, for instance, talk of the number of versions of the Šunaššepa story, ordinarily we shall be obliged to say they are as many as there are works which deal with the legend ; because, with each narration, there will be some innovation, wanton or otherwise. Such changes are mere embellishments and are of little consequence regarding the framework. Secondly, the time-factor should also be considered ; the distinction of different versions must naturally apply to works which are more or less contemporaneous. With regard to works beyond the range of history the question does not arise, for all are ancient. But a work of the 5th cent. A.D. cannot presume to vie with the ancient Aitareya to propound a different version of the story. Any version after all should be backed up by an element of truth. Flagrant innovations which reflect the pulse of a people or of an age cannot claim the status of versions, indeed. The Brahma Purāņa, the first-mentioned of all the Purāņas, for instance, introduces the Invisible Voice (ašarīra-vāk) - ' Do not sacrifice Šunaššepa ; the sacrifice is complete without the immolation Šunassepa bathes in the Gomati-ksetra and is absolved of all respon- sibility by the sacrifice. The motive for this innovation is purely local, that is to glorify the holiness of the Ganges and to signify a revolt against human sacrifice. But can this be designated as a different version ? It is not supported by any trend of tradition which touches the hoary past. The Devi Bhāgavata is full of innovations which are introduced to explain, as it were, the different stages of the story. Thus Harišcandra according to AB first asks for 10 days' time to sacrifice the new born babe, but, the Devi Bhāgavata raises it to one month, for the father is eligible to perform religious rites after 10 days of child-birth, but the mother becomes eligible only after a month ! She should accompany the husband in all religious functions, according to the Ordinances. Can this be called a version ? Harivamša and Vāyu Purāņa find themselves in a medley. Having represented the traditional descent of Jamadagni as the son of Rcīka, the author is at a loss to fix up the Šunaššepa brothers. Fortunately he did not say that Jamadagni was also called Šunahpuccha, but simply removed the last man, Šunolāngūla, in the ' seriatim arrangement ' ! Thus, the brotherhood bears this galaxy - Jamadagni Šunaššepa and Šunahpuccha. Can this be called a version ? Similarly, Haridašva is an unconscious substitute for Harišcandra. When once it entered the holy writ, it was suffered because, perhaps, Haridašva is a name of the Sun God, from whom the Iksvākus were descended. Harišcandra was an Iksvāku ; hence, there could be reconciliation by regarding the king as Haridašva alias Harišcandra. Let us consider one other point. In most of the works, the legend is treated en passant . The importance given or the interest which attaches to the story may be measured, in a way, by the extent of the description in each. The Aitareya,</page><page sequence="102">224 H- L- HARIYAPPA owing to its antiquity, may not come into the picture. All the same, it devotes a whole chapter in six khaņdas (sections) comprising roughly 55 prose bits and 31 gāthās. Other works allot as follows : 1. Rãmãyana - 48 Slokas (2 cantos) 2. Mahābhārata - 3 ,, 3. Harivamsa - 6 ,, (total of two contexts) 4. Brahma Purāņa - 113 „ (2 chapters) 5. Vāyu Purāņa - 4 „ 6. Bhāgavata - 25 ,, (parts of 2 chapters) 7. Devi Bhāgavta 194 „ (4 chapters) Of these, Nos. 4, 6 and 7 follow Aitareya Brāhmaņa, except the narrator's amplifica- tions here and there. The main features are common, as shown in the conspectus. Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 show some divergences. One common divergence that really matters is that Šunassepa is the son of Rcika not of Ajīgarta. That is, the family itself is differently stated, for Rcika is a Bhārgava, Ajigarta is an Āngirasa. While the orthodox school, dating back to the time of the Sarvānukramaņī and prior still the Arsānukramaņī, reaffirms the AB account by assigning Šunassepa to the Āngirasa family changed to that of Visvāmitra, the Rāmāyaņa, Mahābhārata, Harivamsa and Vāyu Purāņa declare him to be a Bhārgava changed into a Vaisvā- mitra. Taking recourse to conjecture only - for no other deduction is possible, - this deviation might have been based on stories current among the populace ; it may represent popular tradition in other words. Another point is about the King's name, Ambarīsa in the Rãmãyana ; Hariscandra in Mbh. and VP, Haridasva in Harivamsa. We have submitted that Haridasva might have been an oversight on the part of Harivamsa. A similar plea must reconcile the divergence of Rām., as Ambarīsa is nowhere else mentioned as an Iksvāku prince. The Ambarīsa of the Mbh. is just an ancient king (Sorensen p. 30), nothing to do with the Iksvākus. Curiously, Hariscandra is not stated among the Iksvāku princes, whose dynastic list is given in Rām. (1.70). Perhaps our Hariscandra is identical with Ambarīsa. For the present purpose We submit that the difference in names is due to the narrator's whim or ignorance. The dynastic lists presented in the Epics and the Purāņas are truly confusing and utterly inconsistent with one another. If, in the light of the above discussion, we come to think of versions at all, they can only be two ; one, the orthodox version represented by AB, followed by the Brāhma, Bhāgavata and Devī Bhāgavata ; the other, the popular version reflected in the Rām., Mbh., Hari. and VP.

Under B, we can see the summary manner in which the story is disposed of, on the basis of which no inference of certain validity can be drawn. The chief criterion in so grouping them is the likelihood of a popular version concurrent with the orthodox one. IX MODERN OPINIONS The Legend of Šunassepa has been a favourite study to many a scholar of recent times. At first it drew attention as a very ancient story so full of human interest. But later scholars like Max Müller and Roth dived deep into their bearings and recorded their impressions a hundred years ago. The former translat- ed the entire piece into English in his history of Ancient Sanskrit Literature130 and the latter's critique, with a German translation of the legend, came out in the Indische Studien.131 An exhaustive and invaluable study has since been provided by Keith in his Rig-veda Brāhmaņas Translated.132 In the long period of time that divided the two scholars Roth and Keith, the legend continued to be of interest to many, from the point of view of Human Sacrifices in Ancient India. Hille- brandt133 and Eggeling134 considered the question deeply. The one believed and the other did not believe in the existence of human sacrifices. Wilson wrote an essay on human sacrifices and John Muir incoroprated his impressions in his Compendium135 Before dealing with this subject of world-wide interest, we may know how the legend has impressed as a piece of literature. Roth has surmised a more ancient metrical version of the story ;136 this inference is evidently based on the fact that certain verses (gāthās) have been interspersed in the narrative, and sometimes the intervening prose appears to patch up the factual detail between two verses. The gāthās are, it is generally agreed, reminiscent of what was most current among the people, and perpetuated in oral transmission from person to person and generation to generation. Regarding the make up of the story, Roth arrived at the following conclusions : (i) The oldest legend about Šunašsepa (alluded to in RV 1.24.11-13 and RV 5.2.7) knows only of his miraculous deliverance by divine help from the peril of death. (ii) This story becomes expanded into a narrative of Sunašsepa's threatened slaughter as a sacrificial victim and of his deliverance through Vjšvāmitra, 130. ASL pp. 408-420. 131.

Weber IL p. 47, Keith (HOS 2£) p. 63t</page><page sequence="104">226 H- L. HARIYAPPA (iii) This immolation-legend becomes severed into two essentially distinct versions,137 the oldest forms of which are respectively represented by the stories in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa and the Rāmāyaņa. (iv) The latter becomes eventually the predominant one, but its proper central point is no longer the deliverance from immolation but the incorporation of Šunaššepa, or (with a change of persons) of Rcika, into the family of the Kusīkas. It thus becomes in the end a family legend of the race of Višvāmitra. There is thus no historical, perhaps not even a genealogical, result to be gained here. On the other hand, the story obtains an important place in the circle of those narratives in which the sacerdotal literature expressed its views regarding the character and agency of Visvāmitra.138 The late Professor Keith, polymath and critic, has analysed the legend thread- bare. It is a piece of work which should serve as an example of critical investiga- tion. Though often oppressive, and never satisfied with the accuracy of things like the proverbial tārkika,139 Keith as a critic undoubtedly exercised a powerful restraint on the hasty and the fanciful in the Research Forum. It must be said, however, that his writings lacked warmth and sympathy, qualities, for instance, that endeared Max Müller to all classes of the literati.140 Keith141 notices a threefold structure in the legend comprising (a) the episode of Varuna, Harišcandra and Rohita, (b) the episode of Šunaššepa and Ajigarta (add Rohita to provide the link) ; and (c) the episode of Višvāmitra's sons and Šunaššepa (add, again, Visvāmitra also). To restate the ' krama ' (a) Harišcandra - Varuņa - Rohita, (b) Rohita - Ajīgarata - Šunaššepa ; and (c) Šunaššepa - Višvāmitra - Višvāmitra's sons. It is pointed out, as already shown by us in the sub-section on RV references, that the RV provides no information whatever about Harišcandra or Rohita or Ajigarta ; so, the whole narrative is a later invention. The utilisation of the RV 137. Mr. Narahari concludes his survey of the Legend of Šunaššepa in Vedic and post- Vedic Literature as follows : 44 We have thus three recensions of the legend of Šunaššepa." Vide A Volume of Studies in Indology presented to MM. P. V. Kane (1941) p. 307. We are obliged to point out that this is an uncritical statement from all accepted canons of textual criticism, cf. the explanations of " Recension and version " in Dr. Katre's Introduction to Indian Textual Criticism " (1941), p. 95. Narahari perhaps meant to say that versions of the story were as many. 138. Rendered by Muir. OST, l3 p. 359 f. 139. One is reminded of Ksemendra's compliment to this class of scholars in his Kavikaņthā- bharaņa (Kāvyamālā), an excellent tract on how to become a poet : Kurvita sähityavidas sakāse srutārjanam kävyasamudbhaväya / Na tārkikam kevalasābdikam vā kuryäd gurum sūktivikāsavighnam // 140. This aspect was specially stressed in numerous messges of sympathy and love that poured in after the demise of this venerable savant, from Queen to commoner.

Rig- Veda Brāhmaņas Translated (HOS 25, 1920), pp. 61-68.</page><page sequence="105">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 227 verses, hundred in all, must be ascribed ' to a time when it was desired to find recitations for the Hotr priest at the Räjasüya in connection with the tale of Šunas- sepa'. Regarding the pre-Brāhmaņa state of the legend, Keith says, " In the opinion of Roth, the legend grew up into its present content during the period when the collection of the RV was in process of being carried out and it was due to it that the series of hymns in the first book to various deities was ascribed to the authorship of Šunassepa. He lays stress on the argument that the argument of the hymns in part depends upon the theory of authorship. On the other hand, in the view of Aufrecht, the authorships ascribed by the Anukramaņī are complied from the notices of the Brāhmaņas and, while this view is not altogether tenable, it would be impossible to come to any definite conclusion regarding the period of growth of the legend from the order of hymns in the Samhitā to the attribution to Šunassepa of the hymns in question." It must be remembered however that the gāthās that are incorporated in AB presuppose the existence of a constructed popular ballad which marked out not only the saving of Šunassepa but also his transfer into the family of Višvāmitra. Keith is satisfied that " from (AB) vii. 17.3 to the end of the verses it runs as a perfectly simple narrative requiring only the names of the speakers to be supplied to make it clear, just as they are supplied in the epic." But both Roth and Keith do not vouchsafe to the not impossible inclusion of Hariscandra and Rohita in the gāthā version, because the Harišcandra-gāthās (AB 7.13 and 15) are " general in the extreme, and so inappropriate is the exhorta- tion to the king to obtain a son in ch. 13 that it is addressed to Brāhmaņs...142 The verses are not chosen out of narrative made up apropos of Hariscandra but are mere general maxims pitted up into a story." But there must be some cause for the sacrifice of Šunassepa. Keith is prepared to think : " that may merely have been an ordinary tale of the performance of the human sacrifice and not a tale of the extraordinary and almost ludicrous action of Hariscandra and Nārada. Very probably the two stories of Hariscandra and his son and Šunassepa have been allowed to mingle, as they seem to belong to different strata of tradition, the first falling among the many stories of the sacrifice of children among the Semetic and other races, and the latter reprobating the practice of human sacrifice as a custom, perhaps one specially favoured by the Añgiras family, which was opposed by other Vedic families." There is no trace of hostility between Vasistha and Višvāmitra who appear as Brahman and Hotr amicably at the sacrifice. There are traces of the regal character attributed to Višvāmitra, since the young Šunassepa is said to succeed to the lordship of the Jahnus as well as the divine lore of the Gāthinas.143 Oldenberg thought that the Šunassepa legend as given in AB provided a good instance of the ancient âkhyânas, which are characterised as narratives in prose and verse, the former supplying suitable introductions to or amplifications of the latter. This is not impossible, for even today, the existence of old legends in oral 142. Kim nu malam kim ajinam kimu smašrūņi kim tapah / Putrām brahmāna icchadhvam sa vai loko'vadāvadah // AB 7,13.9.4, 143. PB xxi. 12.2</page><page sequence="106">228 H- L- HARIYAPPA tradition only, many of them - with all their dialectal liberty, simplicity and homely appeal, would add support to Oldenberg's theory. They are ballads in prose and verse, transmitted with an understandable shyness and reserve among the women-folk only for the ostensible reason that men may laugh at the want of literary polish in it. We imagine, as we witness today, that these ballads have had a continuous tradition from time immemorial. However, Oldenberg was severely criticised and opposed by Keith and the theory rejected, we should dare to confess a feeling, with the latter's tārkika instincts144 coming into full play. It is not that everything in the Âkhyãna theory is based on definite evidence and sound judgment. Yet the deep thinker as he visualised a glimmering light in the horizon pushed his way through, tripping here and there owing to darkness. Con- structive criticism would strive to enlighten these dark spots and help the distant light to spread itself. Thus while reading in the ancient Samhitā (RV) the dialogue between Purūravas and Urvasī, or that between Saramā and the Paņis it is natural to think of a word of explanation here and there being necessary. The psychol- ogical processes in our own minds while understanding the statement and the reply in a dialogue find expression in words, in the Âkhyãna so-called. Such might have been provided by the ancient Vedic bards. But Oldenberg went farther than reasonable, of course in enthusiasm, to assert that such explanatory matter once formed regular part of the Veda, since disappeared or lost. Such unnecessary generalisations set the weight of suspicion on the whole edifice and Keith was too quick to let the key-stone gather cement. Taking the AB account itself as a composite narrative, we are unable to see how a status as such cannot be granted to it.145 Whether reminiscent of the hypothetical Âkhyãna of the Veda or not, the AB narrative in itself may, with a certain amount of co-operative thinking, be regarded as an instance of the Âkhyãna. Defects are pointed out that the verses of the narrative are loosely linked with the prose and that gnomic verses found elsewhere are worked into it and all that. True, how will all that disprove the main characteristic of a more or less logically sequential mixture of prose and verse ? Besides we want to submit that, in the Âkhyâna, which, after all reflects a popular character rather than the high-flown literary unities of action, time and place, we do expect some paradoxes, anomalies and flagrant inconsistencies, which in a way - provided they are not absurd - are their peculiar and attractive features.146 Otherwise how can tradition subsist ? How can it survive the ravages of time and clime, if people's fancy did not feed it specially at a time when writing was a problem and printing unknown? This may be another extreme, but a consideration along the line is necessary while appreciating ancient literary tradi- tions which, may it be remembered, are ever more of the people than of the scholar. 144. Keith, JRAS 1911, pp. 979-1009. 145. Vedic literary tradition actually designates it an äkhyäna, in the sense of a short story complete in itself. Oldenberg only went to the length of defining it and also superimposing its existence as part of the Samhitā. 146. Witness for instance the popular version of the Šunassepa legend in the Devī Bhāgavata or even the more polished yet impossible innovations of the Brahma, The process of change is inevitable.</page><page sequence="107">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 229 Therefore there is still room enough for Oldenbergs while Keiths are absolutely needed to keep the ' balance of power ' ! The Legend of Šunassepa has roused considerable interest among scholars, as revealing the prevalence of human sacrifice in Ancient India. Such a view is not unreasonable, for Šunassepa was actually bound to the stakes. He was saved, no doubt, by divine grace but the canons do not make provision for that. Human sacrifice under the name purusa-medha is prescribed by the Šānkhāyana Šrauta Sūtra (16.10 f.) and the Vaitana (37.10 ff.). An elaborate ceremony has developed in relation to it, in which, according to the Vajasaneyi Samhitā (30) as many as 184 persons of different denominations and professions have to be offered147 as sacrifice. It is incredible on the face of it that such a ritual had ever had any practical demonstration. The consensus of opinion is that this human sacrifice was only a theoretical provision in the Sūtras, occasioned, as Keith opines, to remove the anomaly in the omission of man from the list of victims. The use of a man and four other victims is stated as an offering at the piling of the great fire altar. This usage is not actually laid down by any Brāhmaņa, the most contemplated is the use cf the head of a man who has been slain by lightning cr by an arrow shot, not a victim killed for the purpose, and normally the head of a goat seems to have sufficed. But it is clearly no sacrifice at all.148 There is the other world-wide custom of slaying a human being to act as the guardian of the foundations of a building. This is an unwritten and stealthy practice, if at all. It is no human sacrifice in the sense put forth by the Šrauta Sūtras. Human sacrifice was not uncommon in Greece as we hear stories to the effect. It is revealed that it was widely practised in the age of the Indus Valley Civilisa- tion.149 Stray incidents are also reported from the Bible.150 The theory of sacrificing or giving up what is our best or what we love most, in order to please the Almighty Creator, is not without force ; it has some appeal to the cultivated mind and much more so to the credulous. The principle of surrender reaches its zenith when we hear a story that Rāvaņa offered his head to please Šiva, or that Visņu himself, finding a lotus less than a thousand while he worshipped the same God, without hesitation, pulled out his eye and offered at His feet. This kind of immolation has some justification, when it is viewed in a truly philosophic way. But that will not suit the world. The moment it is turned into a cult, it becomes barbarous, hence the univerasl abhorrence of it. One other point. If ever human sacrifice was contemplated and practised in order to please the Gods, well, the same Gods have recompensed the loss ten-fold. Even in the fables, there is no sacrifice without such compensation which would repair the loss completely. For the 147. Winternitz HIL p.174. 148. Keith RPV, pp. 347-348.

Even so Visņu; the eye was at once restored, and with it he became Supreme Lord of the three worlds. Šunaššepa was sacrificed for all intents and purposes, the result was - Gods were pleased, Šunassepa himself was granted long life and Harišcandra was freed from illness. But when such principles and acts of subtlety and high thinking were canonised, the inevitable result would be brutal executions at dead of night, in mid-forest and amidst ghastly surroundings. Therefore quite early in the history of Man, counteraction expressed itself and to the best of our belief, the Šunassepa sacrifice is an instance of an effective protest against such a system, if it ever existed. It is colourfully represented by some that the native dwellers of India before the Aryan advent indulged in it and the Aryans by various means exerted a healthy influence upon them to give up such horrible customs. X ON THE NAME ŠUNAŠŠEPA Šunassepa ' dog-tailed ' (suna iva sepo asya), is rather a funny name151 for a Rsi, as he is known to be. He is one of the celebrated Centurion Seers (Šatarcins) of the first mandala of RV. He is complimented also as a reputed poet, born in the family of the Aùgirasas (Āngiraso janmanâ'syâjïgartis srutah kaviķ) and yet possessing such an unpoetic name, sets one to think about it. The uncompli- mentary if not despicable nature of it has been noticed by every scholar. Some have felt it not inappropriate with his indigent and, judging from later conduct, barbarous parentage.152 An opinion has been expressed also that though the name relates to a dog and all that, in the time of the Rgveda it did not matter as the dog was not considered a despicable beast at all.153 Some kind of endearment was felt or intended when, for instance, Rcīka's wife, the mother of Šunassepa said Avikreyam sutam jyestham Bhagavān āha Bhārgavah / Mamāpi dayitam viddhi kanistham Šunakam prabho //154 All the same, the queerness of the name and much more, the queerness of its being one of a synonymous series - Šunahpuccha, Šunassepa and Šunolāngūla - are undeniable. The names are truly artificial; they sound like nick-names. That these names, as a series, are spurious is countenanced by the Harivamsa. While tracing the genealogy of Jamadagni and Višvāmitra, there was a problem for 151. Amusing names are perhaps the feature of all times and all nations. Compare - Bull, Boot(e), Black, Burns, Baldwin, Butcher, Stone, Dry-den, Piggot, Swineburn etc., corresponding in Kannada - Kempa, Kariya, Gunda, Hucca, Kāļa, surnames like Teñginakai or Meņasinakai etc. Contrast the practice of gods' names only employed by some people, as a rule. 152. cf. Eggeling - SBE XLIV, p. xxxiv et seq., Winternitz HIL 1.213 n. A kind of censure is reflected in the retention of the genitive (aluk) in those names, cf. Pāņini 6.3.21 - 44 Sasthyâ ākrose " Vārtika 4 thereon, Šepapucchalāngūlesu sunah samjñayam. 153. Hopkins - AmJPh. XV 4 The Dog in the Rig- Veda ' pp. 154-63 (1894). 154. Rām. 1.61.17-18.

Jamadagni was the son of Rcika by Satyavaii daughter of king Gãdhi. Rcika chose to marry the princess whom he loved dearly ; and being pleased with her, prepared the holy caru for the sake of progeny. She partook of it and gave birth to Jamadagni. But there was another legend current, relating to a Rcika who had three sons, the Šuna-brothers, the middle one being Sunassepa. So the undaunted author of the Harivamsa reconciled the divergence by grafting two of these, as brothers of Jamadagni, the status of the middle one being vouchsafed for Šunaššepa. This brotherhood viz., Jamadagni, Sunassepa and Sunahpuccha became more ludicrous than the original combination. In these circumstances, our supposition that there should have been two Rcikas, stated in the foregoing pages, appears plausible. That apart, it is sufficiently reasonable to think that the names of Sunahpuccha and Šunolāngūla are purely imaginary. These two are mentioned for the first time in AB and, only Šānkh SS, of so many works of Vedic Literature, repeats the names. Later, the Vārttika-kāra conceived a special vãrtika comprehending only these three names, as an addendum to the sūtra " Sasthyã ākroše " (6.3.21, SK. 981). That gave these mythical personalities a stamp of reality. Nevertheless, the purpose of the puccha and lāngūla has been no more than to provide the madhyama status to Sunassepa. The concept of the middle one, incidentally, itself deserves to be questioned on two grounds at least. Firstly it is, psycholog- ically, an unsound and unnatural phenomenon ; for, all children are the same to the parents. The distinction of the eldest and the youngest is an almost mischievous precept promulgated by the old text. Tradition fostered it, though in general, it has never been given to mankind to practise it. Secondly, it has no basis in the Samhitā, nor corroboration in any other work of the Vedic period which could be contemporaneous with it. Now to the name Sunassepa itself. It occurs in the Samhitā thrice as already pointed out (RV 1.24.12,13 ; 5.2.7). Other expressions in the Veda with Šuna prefixed are Šunáprstha,155 Šunáhotra,156 Súnãsira,157 Šúnesita.158 The word šuna itself occurs twelve times,159 in two forms súnah (thrice) and šunám (nine times). The Tāņdya Mahābrāhmaņa mentions a Sunaskarņa.160 155. 7.80.1. 156. 2.18.6 ; 41.14 ; 17. 157. 4.57.5 ; 8. The Nighaņtu mentions the word with a double accent as a devatä- dvandva - Šunāsīrā (Nigh. 5.3.34). But in the Samhitā, the word is intitially accented - Šiināsīra. 158. 8.46.28. 159.

Šúnasíra signifies a dual divinity namely Indra- Vayu. According to Yaska (Nir. IX.40),161 it is Vayu and Aditya. Later, the expression signifies two agri- cultural deities, the personifications probably of ' the share and the plough', as Roth thinks.162 Šunáhotra is the name of a Vedic Rsi, father of Grtsamada who is the Seer of the second Mandala. Thrice it has appeared in RV and in loc. pl. only - šuná- ho tresu. Once interpreted as referring to sacrificial vessels of that designation and twice as referring to the Šunahotras, the members of the Šunahotra family.163 Though he does not figure in the Vedic text, we are quite familiar with the versatile Šaunaka under which name Grtsamada is said to be known after he chang- ed over from the Añgiras to the Bhrgu family. In the Bhrgu family he was adopted as the son of Šunaka.164 It is however significant that, in the hymns he saw, he styles himself as a Šunahotra. Now the word šunám165 in the Veda is one of 20 names of sukha (happiness), sometimes used adverbially also meaning ' happily ' (Nigh 3.6.11). Thus the expressions, Šunahotra (one who sacrifices for the sake of happiness), Šunaprstha (the horse which possesses happy, pleasurable, therefore fine backs), Šunaka (the happy man) and Šaunaka (son of the happy man) - all are of good import. The adjective Šūnesita ' drawn by the dog,' (šunā-isita) is in that sense, an instance of the aluk-samāsa with the instrumental suffix not lost. Thus we see, so far as the names of persons in the Vedic range are concerned the first member šuna has consistently conveyed good sense. Why should it be different in the case of Šúnašsépa ? The pada text significantly enough does not analyse the word but shows the double accent, which is explained according to Pāņini 6.2.140 - Ubhe vanaspatyâdisu yugapat (SK 3871). 166 The first member here is sunafr which is, apparently, genitive singular 161.

But as true Vedic application demands, we should explore whether sunah in this compound cannot mean or relate to happiness. In our opinion it can. Before proceeding to elucidate this point, it would be well to discuss the other difficult member, šepa. This word is mentioned in the Nighaņtu along with VaitasáhL among 26 duets of names.167 The meaning is not given.168 The Nirukta explains as follows : " Sepo Vaitasa iti pumspraj ananasy a / Šepaš šapateh spršati- karmaņo vaitaso vitastam bhavati // " - Sepa and vaitasa are names of man's genital organ ; sepa from sap to touch and vaitasa because it is contracted.169 The etymology is not supported by proper authority. Yäska was full of fancy, no doubt, but when he is likely to mislead, we have to look elsewhere. According to Uņādi, sepa is derived from'/ si to lie down or sleep, II A with the suffixes put and asun, which yields the form sepas. But the word ending in a is also found in usage as in ' prahárãma šépam '17° Šepa is associated with šipi in RV 7.100. 5-6 meaning rašmi (ray) as explained by Yäska. Reminiscent of this, sepa must mean brightness or lustre: Prá tát te adyá šipivista nāma Aryáti šamsāmi vayúnâni vidvān / Tám tvā grņāmi tavásam átavyân Ksáyantam asyá rájasafr parâké // Kim it te visņo paricáksyam bhūt Prá yád vavaksé sipivistó asmi / Mā várpo asmád ápa gūha etát Yád anyárüpab samithé babhutha ¡¡in Here šipivista is used in two senses : (1) uncovered like the membrum virile (2) enveloped by rays.172 Now unless urged by the authority of these ancient 167. ...sépah / vaitasáh / ...iti sadvimsatir dvisá uttarāņi nāmāni / Nigh. 3.29. 168. Dr. S. K. Belvalkar thinks that this and the subsequent section of Ch. III of the Nighaņtu are, possibly, additions by a later hand. Being mere lists of words, the supposition is that, like the words (aikapadikas) of Ch. IV, they are also 4 anavagatasamskāra ' words, whose make-up, significance etc. are not known. We submit that sections 29 and 30 of Ch. III may just be two lists of words which were of the nature of anavagatasamskāra appended by the first compilers themselves. Did not the original compilers of the Nighaņtu (say of the first three chapters) meet with difficult words at all in the Veda ? - Reference ÀIOC II (Calcutta) S. K.

It is not infrequent that some good words are abused or used in a euphemistic way to denote some indecent things in human life ; the psychology is one of hearty aversion to give utterance to obscene things, e.g. the use of the word marma and pradhāna, the dialectal sense of which cannot even enter the lexicons. In the same manner it is not unlikely that an excellent word like Šipi meaning ray was abused. What harm if we restore it to its original purity and understand by sepa (sipir èva sepah) a sense like ray, lustre, brilliance etc. ? The point is that Šipi or šepa does not directly mean man's genital organ. It can mean other things also, specially because the older work Nighaņtu has abstained from specifying its meaning. There is some support that we can find from other classical languages.173 Compare Latin cipus, cippus and its Gk. analogue skoipos, which mean a pile, post, pillar, staff, bar, etc. In the light of this, the original significance of šepa may be taken as a pillar or a post. And, if the first member in Šunasšepa can be under- stood in the sense of sukha, happiness, the whole name yields a pleasant sense, viz. a pillar of happiness - a sense which is in perfect keeping with the great idea of Deliverance for which Šunasšepa is all the time remembered. This meaning is possible if the compound could be construed as a tatpurusa : šunasya (sukhasya) šepah (stambhah) Šunaššepali. How to account for the sibilant in between : it ought to be Šunašepah ? This is easily accounted by Pāņini 6.1.157 (Sk. 1073) - Pāraskaraprabhrtīni ca samjñayam / which the Siddh- ānta Kaumudī expands : etāni sasutkāni nipâtyante nāmni / pāraskarah / kiskin- dhā I tad brhatohL etc. / coradevatayor iti samudâyopâdhih / taskarah / Brhaspatiïi / ...Vanaspatih / ityãdi / âkrtiganoyam / The Tattvabodhinï adds, with the flavour of a double-entendre , - akrtiganoy- amiti / Tena šatāt parāņi - paraššatāni kāryāņītyādi siddham /, suggesting that hundreds of such forms can be made, the word paraššata itself being an example ! Thus the aphorism and its vārtikas declare that the instances are not limited and that on their analogy many others in usage can be comprehended. Moreover, Vanaspati (and hence Vanaspatyâdi) is also added as coming within the purview of this rule. Šunaššepa is definitely included in the Vanaspatigaņa174 which, while taking the double accent which is a privilege peculiar to its own group, shares other grammatical incidences also, the sudāgama in this case. Apart from the technical rule, it is needless to stress the phonetic rationale in the expression Šunaš- šepa, where the sibilant helps to step up the pronunciation from the sonant to the surd. The argumentation reaches a fine point indeed, which may, in a way, be considered unnecessary because the human element in language sometimes defies 173. K. F. Johansson's note on sepa. Indische Miszellen, IF 3.213. 174. Supra Note 166.</page><page sequence="113">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 285 all rule ; well, in fact it originates the rules and is unscrupulous enough to force exceptions also. The Tattvabodhini makes a very pertinent statement under the Pāraskara-Sūtra : Pāram karoti pāraskarah, kimapi dhatte kiskindhā, kirn kirn dadhãti vā I Vastutastu rūdhišabdā ete kathañcid vyutpâdyanta iti avayavãrthe nāgrahati kary ah /175 The words are there in language ; attempts will be made to analyse and understand them ; there is no point in being fastidious. Thus the word Šunašsepa can be analysed as a tatpurusa-samāsa : šunasya sepah, being entitled to the sudāgama as a member of the Vanaspati group which in turn is influenced by the Pāraskara rule. This discussion encourages us to think that the padapātha of Sunaššepa is faulty and requires to be emended, from Šúnah-sépah to Suná-sépafr. This involves us in a difficulty relating to the accent of the first member. The rule, Ubhe vanaspatyadisu yugapat,176 prescribes to the two members their own accent (ubhayapadaprakrtisvaratva). According to this, suna as noun meaning happiness takes the prātipadika-svara177 i.e. accent on the final and is so marked in the Nighaņtu - Šunám. But the text, has súnah, the initial accent pointing to the great likelihood of its being, even originally, the gen. sing, of svan, substantive ; for in šúnah, the genitive, being a sup-pratyaya, is unaccented ;178 the accent remains on the stem. Whereas we have sufficient ground to put up a case for the emendation of the pada-text, the emendation of the accent thereof is a natural corollary : Šuná- šépah : Šunásšépah. Following the tendency of the scholiast, it is not difficult to argue for the initial accent of suna even as a substantive. The prātipadika- svara is taken advantage of, usually, when the word defies derivation according to Sâkatãyana (the Uņādi-sūtras). Indeed this exercise is a somewhat thankless job because in great many cases the root-meaning hardly helps the semantic under- standing of the word. All the same it speaks of the profound linguistic speculations of the ancient grammarians to have evolved a grammatical machinery which can dissect the word into its very elements. Therefore derive sunam from'/ sun, to go, VI P.179 Add the suffix asun provided by " Sarvadhâtubhyah asun " (Uņ. 628) ; we get the form šúnas which has the initial accent,180 meaning, movement, 175. The first sentence is an epitome of the com., the second is a quotation. See SK. with Tattvabodhini etc. (Niriiayasägar, Bombay 1942), p. 221 (Sk. 1073). 176. Sk. 3871 (P. VI. 2. 40) 177.

Further, Šúnasafr šepaft Šúnašsépab, which explanation has not got to invoke the sudāgama at all !181 Why not prefer this explanation which agrees with the given accent of the Vedic Text ? It is for the simple reason that a certain Vedic tradition had already a word like šunám meaning happiness and on the analogy of other Vedic words like Brhaspati, Šúnassépa also could be more authoritatively explained. There is a further important clue in this logical procedure which led us to venture on an emendation of the Pada-text and through that - may the Gods forgive ! - on a slight change of accent in the Samhitā also. Here is a basis for some conjecture which is in no way idle. That we have interfered with the authen- ticity or exactitude of the pada-pātha need cause no surprise. The pada-pātha is not infallible, as shown long ago by Yäska himself - (a) Commenting on RV 5.39.1. (yádindra citra mehánãsti) Yäska says - Yad Indra citram cayaniyam mamhaniyam dhanam asti / Yan ma iha nāstīti vā trīņi madhyamäni padani /182 Durga, in support, adds : - Bahvrcānām mehanā ityekam padam / Chandogānām trinyetãni padani " ma iha na " iti / The divergence of the Pada and Samhitā pāthas is thus borne out by the evidence of the Sāmaveda. Durga further characterises this " mehanā " as one of the anavagatas183 ' not understood ', of the vibhāgānavagata type i.e. words whose division is not definitely known. (b) The svarānavagata, an expression which raises difficulty of accent, has resulted in an erroneous pada-pātha e.g. in 4 Váne ná vâyó nyadhâyi câkán '184 RV 10.29.1. Commenting on this, Yäska says : - Vana iva väyo veh putras cäyanniti vā kämayamäna iti vā / veti ca ya iti ca cakāra Šākalyafr / Udāttam tvevam âkhyâtam abhavisyat asusamāptaš cārthaķ / - Šākalya has analysed vāyaļi into vā and yafr : then the finite verb would have had the accent185 and the sense would have been incomplete. (c) We have now added the case of Šúnassépa. It is our belief that the story of Šúnassépa, as given in AB, was current with its component parts developed, by the time Šākalya formulated the pada-pātha; and that Šākalya, while he pieced together the Samhitā and provided the division into words (sakala = bits), very probably exercised the liberties of an editor and exponent. This circumstance 181. Šūnas and Šunam may both be admissible like sepas and sepa as adverted to above. Words that end in -a as well as -s are not uncommon, e.g. nabham, nabhas ; tapam, tapas ; saham, sahas ; maham, mahas ; tamam, tamas ; rajam, rajas. - from Dvirûpa-kosa quoted by Tattvabodhinï on Uņ. 628 (p. 560 Sk.

RV 5.2.6 " Šúnás cicchépam " must be regarded as an anavagatasamskāra of the viksepānavagata type i.e. words whose separation into parts becomes unintellig- ible.186 (d) Many a verse from the Rgveda we find repeated in the other Samhitās. In this process, many variae lectiones will reveal themselves. In dealing with RV 3.31.6, in the previous chapter, we recorded a number of v.l.187 between RV, MS and TB. Some v.l. are found in AV also {cf. RV 4.57.8 with AV 3.17.5, for instance). This fact is cited just to reconcile oneself to the fact that the most wonderfully accurate transmission of the Vedic texts withal, a few variations or even pitfalls here and there - utterly negligible, indeed, in proportion to the huge mass of literature - may be discovered ; it may not be sin to know them ! Even so with the pada-pãtha. One more point before concluding this investigation. Šunašsepa is also written with aspiration as Šunaššepha. This is a post- Vedic phonetic change only, perhaps contributed by the Gauda country. We find the pha in Gorresio's text of Rām. Wilson has adopted that spelling in his translation of the Visņu Purāņa (quarto) and opines that is the ' usually written form,'188 which statement reminds us of his long stay in Calcutta. The English translations of Purāņic texts from Bengal adopt the pha while the Vedic texts of the BI series stick to the original form, pa. Yet, some etymological reflection may not be undue. Šepha is remini- scent of Šipha or Šiphā, just as Sepa is of Šipl. Šiphā, or Šiphā-kanda according to Amarasimha, means fibre, stalk, or fibrous root.189 Monier Williams records both m. and f. forms of the word, meaning fibrous root or root in general. Even this dialectal change helps the understanding of šepha in a good sense : thus šunasya sukhasya sepho mūlam, 'the root of happiness'. Sunašsepha of the story became that to the Aryan folk after the great Deliverance. The orthography of Šunasšepa requires mention. It is most commonly written as Sunalisepa ; in devanāgarī script also, with a visar ga after Šuna. If this practice is meant to remind ourselves of the aluk , it is indeed scholarly precision. In our humble opinion, the phonetic delicacy is thereby disregarded ; try to pronounce as it is written - writing, we hope, is meant to follow pronuciation ; then, we see the rigidity of the canon or of our understanding thereof. Even granting the aluk, what precludes the visarga from colaescing with the succeeding sibilant ? Double s is not at all hard to pronounce being a breathed sound ; it only requires 186. See Durga on p. 358 already cited, e.g. 44 dyävä nah prthïvï" iti yathã cf. BD 2.115 which recommends the order of words according to their sense - 4 arthād āsīt kramo yathã,' giving a third example narā vā šamsam. Cf. RV Pr. 2.43. 187. Notes 18, 22 and 24. 188. Note on RV 1 .24 in his translation of RV Vol. I, p. 59 of the original edition. Moreover, he persists in writing the word as sakārānta, Šunahšepas, which is a fad similar to his Viswadevas, not Višvedevas ! Such instances are not uncommon among scholars in general. • 189.

It will be equally just to respect ' Pāraskaraprabhrtīni ' (Sk. 1073) in this case ; and the famous maxim about coalescence : Samhitaikapade nityã nityä dhätüpasargayoh / nityä samāse väky e tu sā vivaksām apeksate // Rv Prãtisâkhya clinches the whole issue when it says that the visarga before a breathed conjunct consonant is wrong and definitely gives the correct form as Šunassepa [samyogader ūsmaņah pūrvam āhur visar janîyam adhikam svaropadhāt/33] The current orthography of words like Šamkara and alamkāra urges comment, but we must desist out of deference to the revered teachers. Liberty is nobody's monopoly, yet it is everybody's first claim ! To sum up : (a) The ugliness of the name Šunassepa and of the antecedents of his personal- ity are a later fancy, dating, possibly, even from the time of the pada-pātha. Its original significance points to Šunassepa being a ' pillar of happiness.'190 (b) The pada-pātha of the word Šúnaššépah, given as Šúnabšépab, reminding us of the aluksamāsa and also of the first member being the gen. sing, of Švan, is defective. An emendation thereof as Šúna-sépak is not illogical. 190a ( c ) With a little shifting of the accent, the emendation will be better as Šunáššépak in the samhitā-pātha and Šuná-šépafr in the pada. (d) The pada-pātha is not infallible as proved by the ancient exponent of the Veda, Yäska, whose criticism of its author Šākalya is marked by a peculiar candour, which warrants a supposition that the pada-kāra was not far anterior of the Nirukta-kāra. (e) The word Šunassepa came to have an aspiration at the end (Šunassepha), as a dialectal peculiarity, found in the regions of Bengal.

The story of Sunassepa's deliverance191 is a Vedic fact. According to one Seer, Šunašsepa was saved from a thousand-fold stake by Agni (RV 5.2.7) while another singer paises Varuna for having freed him from his bonds (1.24.12,13). Sunassepa himself is one among the centurion seers (satarcins : seers of hundred verses) to whom is attributed the revelation of the first mandala of the Rgveda. 2. The other Samhitās know him as seized by Varuņa (varuņa-grhīta) and then freed on praising him with RV 1.24.15 (Uduttamám), which is a very favourite prayer to Varuņa, in almost all the Samhitās, that he might graciously release the worshipper from his threefold pāša, at the head, in the middle and at the bottoms This stanza in later times inspired a philosophic interpretation, that it was an appeal for freedom from worldly ties. 3. It is the Aitareya Brāhmaņa (7.13-18) that spins a complete narrative of the legend. It is repeated, with slight difference only, by the Šānkhāvana Šrauta Sūtra. The central theme of Sunassepa's escape from sacrificial immolation has been linked at the beginning and at the end to two other episodes. The introduc- tory link is provided by Hariscandra and his son Rohita whose entanglement with God Varuņa brings about the main event of sacrificing Sunassepa. The concluding link is provided by Višvāmitra, the universal friend, to whose family Šunašsepa after release is adopted as the eldest son inheriting both regal authority and divine lore from the adoptive father. The narrative is a mixture of the Brāh- maņic prose and the popular gāthā. It has been supposed that the legend perhaps existed in the form of a ballad even before AB. 4. Works like the Sarvānukramņī which are but ancillaries to the Veda repeat the story as given in AB. The famous commentators, Sadgurušisya and Sayana and their ditto Dya Dviveda scrupulously follow AB and show no influence of the other version of the story, though it was positively current in their times. 5. In later literature, the two epics, the Harivamša and Vāyu Purāņa present a different version of the story, which is believed to reflect the popular account of it. The Brāhma, Bhāgavata and Devi Bhāgavata repeat the Aitareya, herein called the orthodox version, with slight innovations here and there which reflect the local taste and temperament in their respective ages. 6. The Legend of Sunassepa provides good scope for sociological study in successive stages. The eager theorist can suspect cannibalism and human sacrifice once upon a time. Sale of children and eating dog's flesh are indications of the 191. It was stated above that the Legend of Šunašsepa was prescribed to be recited at the Coronation ceremony of Kings. W. H. Robinson states that this corresponds to the precise point where a copy of the Holy Bible is presented by Bishops to the British Sovereigns when crowned at Westminster. (See 4 The Golden Legend of India or the story of India's god-given Cynosure ' by W, H. Robinson, Luzac &amp; Co., London, 1911).</page><page sequence="118">240 H- L- HARIYAPPA extent to which poverty could drive the people. Manu absolves the ancient rsis of the taint of crime nevertheless.192 The theory of the prevalence of human sacrifice is rejected by almost all scholars. It is provided for in some sociological texts to give the stamp of perfection to the theoretical structure of sacrifice. The Šunaššepa Legend is a protest against human sacrifice which the Aryans found prevalent in the land, when they arrived from the north-western regions. The Indus Valley experts have unearthed evidence to think that human sacrifice prevailed as a custom in the age envisaged by the finds. 7. A study of the name Šunaššepa has been presented in detail in an attempt to inquire whether the name was, in the time of RV, of an uncomplimentary signifi- cance. It has been possible to establish that it could have signified worthily, a " pillar of happiness " in consonance with the great idea of Deliverance for which Šunaššepa's name is immortalised. Šunahpuccha and Šunolāngūla are spurious names, and the concept of the 4 middle one,' to propound which only these names were conceived, is psychologically unsound and, what is more, prone to inculcate unethical ideas into credulous minds. Incidentlly, the infallibility of the pada- pātha and its hoary antiquity within the Vedic Age have become matters of doubt. Human nature being the same always, the sacred texts seem to be no exception to the falterings of transmission through the holiest agencies of old, the Rsis and the Äcäryas. 192.

They are regarded as having seen entire Maņdalas (maņdaladrastārah), the seventh (104 hymns) and the third (62 hymns) respectively. There have been innumerable references to the two sages in Sanskrit Literature, ancient and modern. Much has been written also about them by Orientalists of the past and present century. Nothing new and sensational can be unearthed now. The purpose of this study is mainly to unravel the problem of the ancient feud between Vasistha and Višvā- mitra and understand their mutual relationship in its true perspective. Let us first know what our most ancient authority, the Rgveda, has to say about them, comment and criticism being put off to a later section of the chapter. For the sake of convenience, we just invert the order and deal with Visvāmitra first. In the Rgvedic compilation, Visvāmitra's is the earlier mandala.

(Indra replies) Yes, O Visvāmitra and Jamadagni, as the Soma is being pressed in your sacrificial home, I will come with gifts (then, you will offer me the hymn). The above references are adequate enough to give us a sketch of the sage Visvāmitra of the Rgveda. He is a great rsi, god's favourite and wonder-worker. His connection with Sudās, the Bhojas and the Bharatas has been expressed. He has the co-operation and regard of other priests, Jamadagni, Angirasas and the Maruts. His was the leading part as priest at a thousand-offer-sacrifice (III 53.7). He wielded great influence as he made heaven and earth extol Indra and was confident that his prayer to that Deity would ensure protection to his disciples the Bharatas. He is not less efficient in composing beautiful hymns, hearing which the gods, specially Indra, would shower bounty upon him and his followers. Final- ly, his descendants, the Visvāmitras, have kept up the great tradition set up by him. They continue to be Indra's favourites, for one of them invokes Indra as a Kaušika (I 10.11). As the seer Reņu says, the Visvāmitras always enjoy the favours of Indra. 6. The pada-pātha divides this into two words sahasah and putra, but both have last accent apparently on account of 44 ãmantritasya ca " (Panini VIII 1.19), though ' sahasah ' being in the genitive cannot come under that rule. The sarvānudātta will apply to it only if it is regarded as one with 4 putra,' Could it be one word like Vãcaspati ?</page><page sequence="122">244 H- L- HARIYAPPA The wonderful achievement of Višvāmitra, referred to above (III 53.9), is the subject of an entire hymn viz. III. 33. It is in the shape of a dialogue between Višvāmitra and the Rivers, at the confluence of the Vīpāš and Šutudrī (Beas and Sutlej). The sage prays to the Rivers to become fordable for him and his royal patorn Sudās and his retinue. The Rivers feel flattered of course by his prayer, but do not comply because they have had to obey a higher Power. But Višvā- mitra's repeated appeal in fulsome words moves them in the end to oblige him. RV III 53 is an important hymn giving us the personal history of Višvāmitra in another episode viz. the conduct of the Horse-sacrifice (ašvamedha) on behalf of the Bharatas. This part of the hymn constitutes very good poetry. Višvāmitra entreats Indra to stay at the sacrifice, not to go away : entreats him as a son entreats the father by holding the skirts of his garment. Then he calls upon the Adhvaryu to join in the reception, commends the soma-offer through the favourite liaison Agni, feels much gratified at his officiating at the Asvamedha ; the Bhojas, the Angirasas and the Maruts honour him. He then draws inspiration through his earlier deeds of glory, viz. the crossing of the Rivers and helping Sudās's sacrifice whereby he elevated himself in the estimation of Indra. And he further encourages the Kušikas to praise more and drink more along with the great gods. Surely, the wielder of the thunderbolt, Indra, to whom the Višvāmitras have offered praise, will make them affluent. In stanza 14, the great sage switches on to a different strain, as is not unnatural for a man in power for the time being. It is a famous verse, which has drawn the attention of scholars7 especially regarding Vedic geo- graphy- Kim te krņvanti Kikatesu gāvo Nāsi ram duhré ná tapanti gharmám / Ā no bhara prámagandasya védo Naicāšākhām maghavan randhayä nah // III 53-14. Translation - What will the cattle do for you in the Kikata country ? They do not draw milk for preparing the soma, nor do they heat the ' gharma ' (a sacrificial vessel) with milk in it. Bring us the wealth of Pramaganda as well as the holdings of the Nīcašākha. It is not impossible that there is some sarcasm behind this utterance of Višvāmitra directed against his enemies. It is the business of Indra to go to any person that praises, here Indra is dissuaded from such a solicitude : what will they do for you in a damned, unmentionable, (Kikata is a harsh enough name, by the way) out of the way place, those cattle (gāvah in the sense of pašu) i.e. barbarous people ? They make no offering, perform no rite. They are usurers and of low birth. Carry away their wealth for us, O Indra. Such is the venom that Višvā- mitra is capable of pouring against the enemy. 7 See " Kikata in RK-Samhitā " by K. C. Chattopadhyaya, Allahabad, in the Woolner Com- memoration Volume, Lahore. Stating all previous conclusions on the subject Dr. Chattopadhyaya says Kīkata is Kuruksetra and not Magadha as some other scholars have said. cf. VI I p. 159.</page><page sequence="123">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 245 The next two verses of the hymn (III 53.15-16) are indicative of Višvāmitra' s discomfiture on one occasion. Višvāmitra bécame a victim of unconsciousness (amati) ; then the Sasarparī (trumpet-like sound) given out by Jamadagni restored him. Sasarparī put new life into Višvāmitra. The last four verses of the hymn are the notorious Vasistha-dvesinyah alleged to be imprecations against Vasistha. Durgâcârya, being a Kāpisthala Vāsistha, refuses to comment on them (com. Nir. IV 14.2). In point of fact, these are ex- pressions of hatred and raillery against an enemy in general ; he is not specified as this or that person. The learned people never care to ridicule the ignorant. Surely people would not put forward an ass to compete with a horse. " May he who hates us be downfallen and may his vital breath abandon him whom we hate." Still worse, he 4 heats (the enemy) like an axe and cuts him like a Šimbala tree ' ; (the enemy) 4 vomits foam like a seething and overboiling cauldron.'8 (B) VASISTHA The word Vasistha has been used in the Rgveda no less than fifty times. On a few occasions only (II 9.1, VII 1.8, X 15.8, 95.17) it is used as an adjective meaning best, excellent (vasumattama, vasayitrtama). The other references are sufficient to present a concrete sketch of the personality of Vasistha and the achievements of himself and his followers. The greatest deed of Vasistha is the success which he brought to Sudās in the famous Battle of the Ten Kings (Dāšarājna) (VII 18 ; 33), on which occasion, he also, like Višvāmitra, persuaded the River Parusņī to leave way to his disciple Sudās. Vasistha became the family priest of the Bharatas and the people of the Trtsus prospered (VII 33,6). He was able to lure Indra away from the Soma drink at Pâsadyumna's sacrifice, to the sacrifice which he himself was conducting (VII 33.2). He was equally the favourite of other gods. The Ašvins helped him out of a fix, though the occasion is not specified (I 112.9). Varuna gave him a lift on his ship (VII 88.3 and 4). The birth of the sage Vasistha has been stated, but unfortunately, not in clear terms (VII 33.10-14) ; he was born of the Apsaras Urvašī by Mitra and Varuņa at a sacrifice. Sâyana believes in the repeated births of Vasistha (VII 33.9). Professor Velankar9 has pointed out, in an admirable article, how in each " Family-book " (mandala), certain hymns can be marked out as ' family-hymns ' i.e. hymns which describe the family history and glory of the seer of the mandala. This invests the poetry of the Rgveda with a stamp of concreteness and realism. A hymn of praise to a god, whom we cannot see, would otherwise, be airy nothing. 8.

According to Geldner (cited by Prof. Velankar), only III 53, VI 47, and VII 33 were pointed out as family hymns.</page><page sequence="124">246 H- L- HARIYAPPA Now it is possible to get a brief, yet clear enough, sketch of some of the great Vedic personalities. The history and geography of Vedic India glimmer here and there, lighting up at least a few patches of time and space. The history of the sages, for instance, can be traced to two to three generations if not more. Thus among the Višvāmitras we can . trace three : Visvāmitra-Madhucchandas-Jetā, Višvāmitra- Kata-Utkïla. So among the Vasisthas : Vasistha-Šakti-Parāšara etc. Even so the great rivers of the Punjab and Madhyadeša. Peoples and principalities like the Bharatas, the Trtsus, the Purus, the Pañcajanas and the Kikatas etc. have a histo- rical reality about them. Yet we are warned not to suppose that these family- hymns were made to design. They are but accidental and reflect what was in vogue in Vedic society - viz . that each family cherished the glory of its ancestors. The family-hymns of the Vasisthas are pointed out to be two, i.e. VII 18 and 33. The main theme of the eighteenth hymn is the Battle of the Ten Kings which is described in detail. There does not seem to be much action or melee in the Battle. King Sudās had after all a small army and he was almost to be routed as the enemy hosts hemmed in on three sides, with the powerful Parusņī threaten- ing the rear. The alternative was either to fight with the enemy straight and take the consequences or to perish in the river stream. At this crucial moment Vasistha's prayer to Indra brought about Sudās's success. By his persuasive hymns (which are not given as in the case of Višvāmitra) the River Parusņī rendered herself shallow enough for the armies to cross over and by the time the enemies pursued, the stream swelled to its original volume and velocity so that the rank and file of the enemy were simply washed down marking several furrows on the surface of the stream. The few that succeeded in swimming across were easily destroyed by Sudās. The description which is highly poetic, with subtle irony to embellish it may be illustrated, by a few verses quoted below.10 Ārņāmsi cit paprathānā Sudāsa índro gādhānyakrņot supārā / Šárdhantam Šimyúm ucáthasya návyalj Sapam sindhūnām akrņod ášastih // VII 18.5. " Indra made even the vastly flowing waters of (the Parusņī) shallow and easily fordable to King Sudās. He who is fit to be honoured by our hymn made the arrogant Šimyu and his imprecations the floating dirt (on the surface) of the River." Puroļā it Turvášo yáksur āsīt Râyé mátsyâso nisitā ápíva / Šrustím cakrur Bhrgavo Druhyávaš ca Sákhâ sákhâyam atarad visūcofr // -6 " Turvasa, the sacrificer, himself became the cake-offering ; and so were also the Matsyas, who thought as if they were specially fitted for receiving wealth !

Even the swift (horse) could not reach the resting-place, i.e. the camp.

The whole trend is ironical, cruelly, as Prof. Velankar puts it. Prof. Velankar's inter- pretation is quite original. Although differing totally from Sãyana whose com. here, to be frank, cannot help us to get a concrete and cogent picture of the fight, the Professor has hit off a brilliant idea by taking puroļāh in the sense of puroļāša (purodāsa), 4 cake-offering.' (puroļāh purogāmī purodātā vā : Sãyana !). Puroļāh is, perhaps, to be taken as a Nairukta abbreviation of purodāsa. Helplessly does Wilson remark : 4 The legend, such as it is, is very obscurely told.' (RV Tr. Vol. 4, p. 57 n2) 12. The last line of the verse is, again, ironical. Prof. Velankar takes câyamâna as an adjective while Sãyana considers it a patronymic. The word occurs twice in the Bharadvāja Mandala (VI 27.5 and 8) referring to Abhyâvartin, a king of that name. In that context, Prof. Velankar construes the word as a patronymic, 44 Abhyâvartin Câyamâna." Vide JUB Sep. 1941 (Vol. X, part 2) pp. 97 and 109. cf.

In a helpful manner, favour the heart's desire of Paij avana and also his sovereign rule which is indestructible and never grows old." The other family hymn,13 VII 33, sings the glory of the Vasisthas in general and also refers to the birth of the patriarch in particular : The opening verse is impressive- Švityáňco mā daksiņatāskapardāķ Dhiy am j invaso abhí hi pramandúfr / Uttísthan voce pári barhíso nřn ná me dūrād ávitave Vásisthâfr // VII 33.1. 13. It appears quite meet to call this a family hymn, for it is borne out by the rsi and devatā thereof. Of the first nine verses, Vasistha is the Rsi, the sons are the devatā, for the remaining six, he is the deity and the sons are the Rsis. It is also regarded as a samvāda between Indra and Vasistha. cf. Sarvā. (ed.

Holding the press-stone, he always speaks with authority in front of all. Wait upon him with a delighted mind, here comes Vasistha to you, oh descendents of Pratrd." The Dāšarājna war is described again in the 83rd hymn which is a prayer to the dual divinity Indrā-Varuņa. It is described as a past event when Indra and Varuņa jointly gave strength to Sudās to resist the onslaught of the enemies and when they directly also rendered the enemy powerless (vv 6-8). Dâsarãjné páriyattãya višvátafe Sudāsa Indrā- Varuņāvašiksatam / Svityáñco yátra námasã kapardíno Dhiyâ dhívanto ásapanta Trtsavafr / / VII 83 • 8 " In the Battle of the Ten Kings, Sudās was overwhelmed by the enemy on all sides. The white-complexioned Trtsus supported him with rites and prayers. (At such a trying time), both of you taught Sudās (to resist the attack)." But the immediate concern as indicated by vv 1-5 seems to be to face other enemies. The Dāšarājna war marks a former victory. Sudās had had to contend with enemies from within and without continuously. In fact the 5th verse appears to be a prayer just before the day of battle : Īndrā-Varuņāv abhya tapanti Mâghânyaryó vanúsâm árâtayab / Yuvám hi vásva ubháyasya rājathah Ádha smá no'vatam párye diví // -5 " The fierce weapons of the enemy distress me, Oh Indra and Varuņa, as also the more malignant among my foes. You reign supreme over both fortunes (of Earth and Heaven). Therefore, pray, do protect us on the day of battle." The efficacy of the prayers and consequent popularity of the Vasisthas gave rise, alongside, to bitter jealousy. Hence we find throughout the mandala frequent appeals to the gods for protection from the malignant attacks of the enemy. It is often the fate of the gentle and the noble folk to suffer at the hands of back- biters. The latter have no face nor ground to attack openly ; but are extremely jealous of the good man's goodness. So the beast in them plays behind the back. Similar was the case with Vasistha. Apart from the foreign enemies whom his tribe had to imet almost as daily occupation in their new settlements, there must Bull DCRI xi-17</page><page sequence="130">252 H- L- HARIYAPPA have been a good deal of stabbing from behind ; so much so that Vasistha prays Indra and Varuna to destroy the enemy, be he a Dása or an Ärya.17 In this connection we are led to believe that it is not mere prayer to the gods, or offering at a sacrifice, or even the flourish of weapons that led the chieftains to victory. All these straightforward efforts were implemented if not superseded by black magic, charms and spells. A variety of fiends, called Rãksasas or Yãtudhãnas, enter the arena and play havoc. It is said they would be employed - even as they employ mercenaries nowadays - by force of magical spells by the contending parties to kill the enemy. Thus it is said, was brought about, the death of Vasistha's son Šakti,18 who, at the instigation (as is imagined) of Visvãmitra was thrown into a forest-fire by the fiends employed by the sons of Sudãs. Though a later account, we may cite the incident of King Kalmãsapãda becoming a Rãksasa himself to devour the hundred sons of Vasistha.19 Vasistha's person proved no exception to the attack of sorcery. Visvãmitra commanded the river Sarasvati to wash Vasistha down her stream to him so that he could kill him. She obeyed but made the current too quick for Visvãmitra to grapple the victim. Vasistha was at the same time saved. But Visvãmitra cursed the river to run blood for a year whence she became the Arunã (" Red River ").20 It must be such extensive recourse to witchcraft that prompted Vasistha to invoke the protection of the dual gods Indrã-Soma against the Yãtudhãnas ; the hymn is commonly designated as Raksoghnasūkta (VII 104). Yó má pãkena mánasã cárantam Abhicáste ánrtebhir vácobhife / Apa iva kãsínã sángrbhitãb Ásannastvásata Indra vāktā // VII 104-8 " May he who with false allegations maligns me, who is of a pure mind, may such a speaker of falsehood, Oh Indra, cease to be, like water grasped in the fist."

Here is a sample of his reaction to the fiendish spirits called Yâtus : Ūlūkayātum susulukayãtum Jahí sváyâtum utá kókayâtum / Suparnáyãtum utá grdhrâyãtum Drsádeva prá mrna ráksa Indra // -22 " Destroy the evil spirits whether they are in the form of owls big and small, in the form of a dog or a wolf, or an eagle, or a vulture, pound the demon, O Indra, as with a boulder." índra jahí púmãmsam yãtudhânam Utá s tri y arri mâyáyâ šāsadānām / Vigrīvāso mūradevā rdantu Mā té dršantsūrvam uccárantam // -24 "Put down, O Indra, whether it is a man or a woman, who as an evil spirit does mischief by deceit. Let these bloodthirsty demons perish w,th their heads cut off, so that they may not live to see the rising sun." Affecting his personal history, we find Vasistha caught in a couple of amusing if not compromising situations. The 55th hymn is called prasvâpinyupanisat, one that sends all to sleep. The contents may be summarised as follows The Seer addresses the attacking dog.21 4 On brindled dog, when you open your mouth to bark, there do flash like shining weapons, your teeth through the jaws. Desist and sleep soundly. Or pursue a thief or a robber ; why do vou bother us who are praisers of Indra ? May you tear asunder the pig, and the pig tear you in retaliation ; why do you bother us who are praisers of Indra ?" Then he pronounces a spell as it were : " Let the mother sleep, let the father sleep, let the dog sleep and the lord of the house as well ; let all the relations sleep and so the men round about. Whoever sits, moves about or sees us, the eyes of all those shall we close, so as to make them as motionless as this mansion. With the thou- sand rays does the Great Benefactor (Sun) rise from amidst yonder sea. With his gracious help shall we send all people to sleep. Those who lie in the vestibule or in the carriages or those ladies who lie on mattresses, the ladies of auspicious fragrance - all these shall we send to sound sleep." Such an encounter with a canine sentinel and such occasion to put the whole life of a mansion into deep slumber must mean a peculiar situation for Vasistha ! 21. RV VII 55.2-8.

The Brhaddevatā relates the story22 - 44 Once during night, Vasistha in a dream entered Varuņa's house. Then came the watch-dog to attack him. Barking and rushing upon him, he was trying to bite him. Vasistha subdued him with a couple of verses and sent him to sleep ; even so did Vasistha cause all Varuņa's establishment to sleep too." The same is described in another setting23 which is more funny. " That these constitute a lullaby is related in stories. Once upon a time Vasistha was thirsty and hankering for food, having had to starve for three nights. On the fourth night, he decided to steal and came to Varuņa's house. In order to to lull the sentry and the hounds to sleep while he entered the commissariat, Vasistha saw and recited these seven rks commencing with 4Yád Arjuna' . " The 86th is a sort of penitential hymn praying to God Varuņa to absolve the worshipper of all sin. The expressions are such as to make us think that the seer i.e. Vasistha himself had committed great sin and is therefore begging Varuņa's mercy. 2. 44 Do I say this to my own soul ? How can I get unto Varuņa ? Will he accept my offering without displeasure ? When shall I, with a quiet mind, see him propitiated ? 3. I ask, O Varuņa, wishing to know this my sin. I go to ask the wise. The sages all tell me the same. Varuņa it is who is angry with thee. 4. Was it an old sin, O Varuņa, that thou wishest to destroy thy friend, who always praises thee ? Tell me, thou unconquerable lord, and I will quickly turn to thee with praise freed from sin. 5. Absolve us from the sins of our fathers, and from those which we committ- ed with our own bodies. Release Vasistha, O King, like a thief who has feasted on stolen cattle, release hini like a calf from the rope. 6. It was not our own doing, O Varuņa, it was necessity an intoxicating draught, passion, dice, thoughtlessness. The old is near to mislead the young ; even sleep brings unrighteousness. 22.

O Lord, Varuņa, may this song go well to thy heart ! May we prosper in keeping and acquiring ! Protect us, O gods, always with your blessings."24 Reflecting upon these verses, it is not necessary to suppose that Vasistha himself committed all sins contemplated, for instance, in the sixth stanza above. The whole hymn is like an 44 aparādha-ksamāpaņa-stotra," praying for forgiveness of sins which are apt to be committed by man ; a repetition of the hymn every day by the eager worshipper also ensures desisting from committing the sins specified. In other words, it exerts a kind of prophylactic influence on the mind of the worship- per. Vasistha perhaps designed this hymn for the benefit of his numerous follow- ers. The last stanza signifies a typical finish for such hymns. With a little stretch of imagination one thinks that Vasistha had a strange experience of the sea ; perhaps a shipwreck. Father Varuņa should, of course, save him. 4 Apām mádhye tasthivāmsam trsņāvidajjaritāram / Mrļā suksatra mrláya //25 44 Thirst has possessed me, thy worshipper in the midst of the waters, grant me happiness, O Lord of Wealth, grant me happiness." Evidently the seer longs for peace and contentment, being caught in the midst of worldly greed. He is at sea, as the English idiom has it. The reference has to be viewed more philosophically than literally. But from another context, however, Vasistha's sea-voyage seems to be a certainty. (RV VII 88.3-4). The Seer sings : 44 Boarding the ship, when Varuņa and I entered the mid-ocean and floated with other vessels on water we indeed very much enjoyed the delightful rocking of the ship. 44 Amīvahāstau vâstospatyâdyâ gâyatrî sesâtryuparistâd brhatyàdayo'nustubhah prasvā- pinya upanisat " / 24.

Further, the intelligent god, by way of happy time for the minstrel, extended many a dawn into day. (i.e. he enabled the sage to spend many happy days on board the ship."27 Lastly, Vasistha was initiated into the deepest secrets of Existence by Varuņa, who, in this manner can be said to have exercised a truly paternal care over his own son : Uvaca me Váruno médhirãya Triķ sap tá nãmâghnyã bibharti / Vidvān padásya gúhyâ ná vocad Yugaya vípra úparâya šíksan //28 " Varuņa told me who am intelligent the thrice seven names that the Cow (or Speech) bears. The wise and skilful Varuņa also imparted the secrets of the Supreme world to me, his favourite pupil." (C) VASISTHA- VIŠVĀMITRA RELATIONSHIP There has been much conjecture and concoction on this point throughout Sanskrit Literature ; and even in recent opinions expressed. But if the Rgveda is to be regarded as the basis of our legends and legendary study, it must be acknow- ledged that there is nothing stated about the mutual relationship of these famous priests of the Rgvedic Age. RV III 4 and VII 2 are both Apri-hymns in the respective Maņdalas. How curious that verses 8-11, i.e. as many as four consecu- tive stanzas, are identically the same ! In the words of M. Bloomfield, " We should expect diversity there if anywhere."29 At worst, the two sages are neither friends nor enemies. One common ground however can be marked out that both befriended the same king, Sudās, at different times. Vasistha helped Sudās to win the Battle of the Ten Kings. Visvāmitra also helped Sudās to cross the con- fluence of Vipāš and Sutudrī, the circumstances of this adventure being however uncertain. It is generally believed30 that Visvāmitra was ousted from Sudās ' partonage by Vasistha, whereupon the former set up the confederacy of the ten chieftains against Sudās. But this opinion is questioned ;31 and a fresh conjecture 26. The Samhitā reads máhobhih, but Sâyana reads ávobhih in the sense of raksaņaih. His authority has however not been traced. Both MM and Poona (Vaidika Samsodhana Man- dala) Editions have noticed this discrepancy between the text and the commentary. 27. RV VII 88.3-4 - A yádruháva Várunaš ca nãvam prá yát samudrám Iráyâva mádhyam / Ádhi yád apām snúbhiš cárã va prá preñkhá înkhayâvahai subhé kám // Vásistham ha Váruno nâvyãdhâd rsim/ ca kāra svápã máhobhih / Stotãram viprah sudinatvé áhnâm yãnnú dyãvas tatánan yãd Usásah // 28.

Visvāmitra was not responsible for the Legaue of the ten kings. On the other hand it is possible to think that both priests were entertained by Sudas on two different occasions. Whoever the family priest he must, and would, have tolerated the advent of another for temporary service. As the Aryans were confronted with problems of land and living, it is natural that they contracted the enmity of local dwellers. So we can suppose that both priests had their own enemies to contend with. A few expressions are pointed out in RV III 53 and RV VII 18,33 and 104 to say that they are indirect references to their mutual hatred. But why such a forced surmise ? If the enmity were true why does not the Veda say it ? There is no harm, for we could, in our time-honoured com- placency, regard that also as a chapter in our vast heritage ! II LATER SAMHITĀS 1. Taiitirlya Samhitā Visvāmitra won the abode of Agni by means of the hymn " This is that Agni." - Ayam so'gniriti Visvamitrasya sūktam bhavati, etena vai Višvāmitro'gnefr priyam dhāmāvarundha, Agnerevaitena priyam dhāmāvarundhe.32 The context is the preparation of the ground for the Fire (Garhapatyacavana). Vasistha should he chosen as Brahman priest according to III 5.2. 44 The Rsis could not see Indra face to face ; Vasistha saw him face to face, he said 'Holy lore shall I proclaim to you so that people will be propagated with thee as Purohita ; therefore do thou not proclaim me to the other Rsis.' To him he proclaimed these shares in the stoma, therefore people were propagated with Vasistha as Purohita ; therefore a Vasistha should be chosen as Brahman priest ; verily he is propa- gated."33 Vasistha and Visvāmitra are together mentioned in connection with the Five Layers of Bricks. The sages Vasistha, Bharad'āja, Visvāmitra, Jamadagni and Višvakarman are identified respectively as Prāņa, Manas, Caksus, Šrotra and Vāc (of the sacrifice) ; they are described as having sprung from the Rathantara, Brhat, 32. TS V 2.3.3, Ayam so'gnih (RV III 22.1) Sarvā. ascribes the hymn to Gâthï son of Kusika. 33.

He who knows thus the prosperity in these (bricks) prospers ; he who knows thus their relationship becomes rich in relations ; he who knows thus their ordering, (things) go orderly for him ; he who knows thus their abode becomes possessed of an abode ; he who knows thus their support becomes possessed of support." This illustrates again the close association of the sages. The phala-šruti is very significant. At all events, it impresses upon the common worshipper the fact that co-operation from all quarters is necessary as exemplified by the great sages of old with regard to the conduct of the sacrifice. It is possible that these sages in particular circumstances did have honest differences, but did not refuse co-opera- tion when required. We find however but one reference to the rivalry between Vasistha and Visvāmitra : Višvāmitra-Jamadagnī Vasisthenāspardhetā sa eta j jamadagnir vihavyam apasyat tena vai Vasisthasyendriyam viry am avrñta - Visvāmitra and Jamadagni had a quarrel with Vasistha. Jamadagni saw the Vihavya hymn36 and drew away all the power and strength of the adversary.37 34. These identifications are symbolical. One should approach them with faith (sraddhā). The point at issue is the importance that the Taittirîya attaches equally to Vasistha and Visvā- mitra along with other sages. They are solid bricks on which the edifice of the Vedic sacrifice is built. Whatever the personal relationships of Vasistha and Visvāmitra were, their active associa- tion with the sacrifice is a testimony to their unqualified contribution to the general welfare of the community. To illustrate the symbolism just referred to, one extract may be given - 44 Ayam puro bhuvas tasya prāņo bhauvãyano vasantah prãnãyano gâyatrï vāsantī gâyatriyai gãyatram gâyatrâd upāmšur upāmsos tri vrt trivrto Rathantaram Rathantarād Vasistha rsih prajāpatigrhī- tayã tvayâ prāņam grhņāmi prajâbhyah." etc. Keith - 44 This one in front the existent, his, the existent's breath ; spring born of the breath, the Gâyatrï born of the spring, from the Gâyatrï the Gayatra (Sāman), from the Gayatra the Upāmšu (cup) ; from the Upāmsu the Trivrt (stoma), from the Trivrt the Rathantara, from the Rathantara Vasistha the Rsi.

(HOS VIII), p. 866.</page><page sequence="139">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 261 Visvāmitra is the seer of a few hymns of the AV. The hymn III 17 is pro- nounced for successful agriculture (Krsili).46 AV V 15-16 are exorcisms to plants ; used for the healing of distempered cattle also ; the later hymn is perhaps directed against insect pests. VI 44 is for cessation of disease, according to Kaušika Sūtra (31.6), it is used in a remedial rite against slander (apavāda). VI 141 is pronunced with marking of cattle's ears (gokarnayor laksyakaranam) and 142 is for increase of food grain (annasamrddhi).47 Višvāmitra's name is thus connected with charms and spells ; but they have all been for good purposes. Whereas, by means of these, diseases were removed and food became abundant, why should the sage not be called Višvā-mitra ' friend of the world ' ? The name Vasistha occurs ten times in the AV. From a study of the contexts and according to the commentary, the word is used as an adjective five times ;48 so we shall consider the other five here,49 referring to the sage. 1. Yävangirasam avatho yävagastim Mitrā varuņā Jamadagnim Atrim / Yau Kašyapam avatho y au Vasistham Yau no muñcatam amhasafr // IV 29.3. " Ye who protect Añgiras, Agasti, Jamadagni and Atri, O Mitra and Varuņa, ye who protect Kasyapa and Vasistha, - do ye free us from distress." 2. Vasistha next appears among other names, including Visvāmitra, (AV XVIII 3.16), as stated above. 3.

And may that Indra, who extended the universe by his might, listen to my words, as I approach him." 46. Cf. RV X 101, IV 57 and parts in VS, Ts, Ta, and Ms. Much of RV material is repeated ; we discover a few variant readings also. Whereas the Samhitā texts have been handed down with meticulous care and accuracy, a comparative study of the repetitions in the different Samhitās must yield interesting text-critical results. 47.

Give heed to this address of mine, this with which Vasistha offers you praise. These prayers, be pleased to accept at the sacrifice." Vasistha also is the seer of a few hymns in AV. I 29 is a hymn to Brahmaņa- spati for a chief's success. (Rāstrābhivardhanam sapatnaksayanam ca) ; an amulet is also tied, it is called abhīvartamaņi-sūkta. III 19-22 are to help friends against enemies (19), to Agni and other gods for various blessings (20,21), to gods in general for splendour (vareas) (22). IV 22 is for the success and prosperity of a king (amitra-ksayanam : for the destruction of the enemy) - for victory in battle according to Kaušika-sūtra. XX 12 and 117 are hymns borrowed from the Vāsistha-maņdala of RV. It may be noticed from the above that Vasistha is by no means a tame sage. He was definitely, and perhaps more actively than Visvāmitra connected with martial adventures. With rites and incantations for a king's success in battle, or for a man's prosperity or contentment, Vasistha must have been a heaven to many kings and men in distress. We notice also that there is not the slightest suggestion of Vasistha- Visvāmitra rivalry. By the enumeration alongside of various Rsis it is fair to think that all these sages were alike holy in the eyes of the worshipper, and a great deal of time must have separated the sages and the com- poser of the hymn (IV 29) with the burden ' taú no muñeatam ámhasah ' - an argument for the late age of at least portions of the Atharva-veda. Public opinion does not seem to have taken note of the alleged fued between Vasistha and Visvā- mitra. On the other hand, recorded evidence points to the universal recognition accorded fo both the sages. Whatever enmity there might have been, it must have been of a purely personal nature - one that did not affect the well-being of the world at large. Ill BRĀHMAŅAS This branch of Vedic literature depicts the contributions made by Vasistha Visvāmitra to the sacrificial cult. They were chief among those who strove to make the Sacrifice a perfect system. There is not a trace of discord between them ; 51. RV VII 22.3, SV 2.279, MS 4.12.4, KS 12.15.</page><page sequence="141">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 263 on the other hand their collective service has oftentimes been emphasised. We shall scrutinize in detail : 1. The Aitareya Brāhmaņa first speaks of Višvāmitra as the seer of the Sampãta Hymns.52 It is said that he first saw a few hymns which Vāmadeva quickly appropriated as his own, whereupon Višvāmitra saw fresh ones.53 In the same manner did Bharadvāja, Vasistha and Nodhas also see several hymns.54 Tān vā etān Sampātān Višvāmitrah prathamam apašyat tān Višvāmitreņa drstān Vāmadevo'srjataivā tvām Indra vajrinnatra yanna Indro jujuse yacca vasti kathā mahām avrdhat kasya hotur iti tān ksipram samapatad yat ksipram samapatat tat sampātānām sampātatvam / Sa haiksāncakre Visvāmitro yān vā aham Sampātān apašyam tān Vāmadevo' srsta kāni nvaham sūktāni Sampātāmstatpratimān srj eyeti sa etāni sūktāni Sampātāmstatpratimān asrjata sadyo ha jāto vrsabhah kanīna Indrah pūrbhi- dātirad dāsamarkairimāmūsu prabhrtim sätaye dhā icchanti tvā somyäsah sakhā- yah Šāsad vahnir duhitur naptyangäd abhi tasteva dïdhayâ manīsām iti / Ya eka iddhavyaš carsaņīnām iti Bharadvājo yas tigmašrňgo vrsabho na bhīma udu brahmânyairata sravasyeti Vasistho'smā idu pra tavase turâyeti NodhāU /55 Later these hymns are praised as follows : Tad etat sūktam56 svargyam etena vai sūktena devāh. svargam lokam ajayan etena rsayah tathaivaitadyajamänä etena sūktena svargam lokam jay anti / Tadu Vaišvāmitram visvasya ha vai mitram Višvāmitra āsa / Višvam hāsmai mitram bhavati ya evam veda yesām caivam vidvān etanmaitrāvaruņah purastāt sūktānām aharahah šamsati /57 " That hymn is heavenly. It is by Višvāmitra, Višvāmitra was the friend of all ; all become friendly to him who knows thus and to those for whom a Mai- trāvaruņa, knowing thus, recites this before the hymns day by day." With this sūkta, again, the gods won the heavens, with this the rsis, and so with this will the sacrificers also win the heavenly world. Similarly the Vasistha hymn : Udu brahmânyairata :58 Tad etat sūktam savrgyam etena vai sūktena devāķ svargam lokam ajayan etena rsayas tathaivaitad yajamänä etena rsayas tathaivaitad yajamä- nā etean sūktena svargam lokam jayanti / Tadu Vāsistham etena vai Vasistha 52. RV IV 19 ; 22 ; 23. 53. RV III 49 ; 34 ; 36 ; 30 ; 21 ; 38. The hymns are enumerated in the order stated in the Brāhmaņa. 54. RV VI. 22, VII. 19 ; 24. 1.61. «5. AB VI 18. 56.

This is by Vasistha. With this indeed did Vasistha approach the abode dear to Indra, and he won the supreme world. He who knows thus will go to the abode dear to Upendra (Visņu) and will win the supreme world." Vasistha and Višvāmitra are both connected with the Šunassepa legend.60 In the sacrifice which was contemplated by king Hariscandra they officiated as priests : Vasistha as Brahmā and Višvāmitra as Hotā. Višvāmitra's part in the story of Šunassepa is remarkable. He befriended poor Šunassepa, adopted him into his family as eldest son and passed on to him his earthly possessions as well as his divine lore. As this story has been fully treated in the foregoing chapter, it is unnecessary to dilate upon it here. Suffice it to remember that the two sages were highly regarded by society and that, between them, no rivalry appears to have existed. Besides the above, there are a few references in the AB to Vasistha only. He is said to have introduced the Rathantara-sāman and Bharadvāja the Brhatsāman, in connection with a hymn of the Rgveda :61 Rathantaram ãjabhãrã Vasisthafr / Bharadvājo Brhad ācakre agner iti Brhadrathantaravantam evainam tat karoti /62 The term Vasistha has been pointed out as an appellation to Agni :63 Adabdhavratapramatir Vasistha ityagnir vai devānām Vasisthaķ /64 Agni is Vasistha (atisayena nivāsahetuļi), the best shelter-giver or protector, anp one whose preference is always for harmless rites.65 In the chapter which describes the sacrifice and the part played therein by the Brāhmaņas and the Ksatriyas, it is said that the famous priests of the times pass on the tradition of the sacrifice and, specially of the participation of the Soma- food (bhaksa), to their respective royal disciples. Thus, Tura son of Kavasa narrated it to Janamejaya son of Pariksit, Parvata and Narada to Somaka son of Sahadeva, to Saliadeva son of Srñjaya, to Bahbru son of Devavrdh, to Bhīma of 59. AB VI 20. 60.

And all these having partaken of the Soma-food rose to eminence, all became sovereign lords, being established in glory, all shone like the Sun, gathering tributes from all quarters.66 This passage warrants the belief that Vasistha was the priest of king Sudās, at least in the early part of his reign. That Vasistha anointed Sudās on the throne is stated in another passage. Enumerating the names of several kings of old who were coronated in the manner in which Indra himself was coronated, it is said " With this great anointing of Indra, Vasistha anointed Sudās Paijavana. Therefore, Sudās Paijāvana went round the earth completely, conquering on every side, and offered the horse in sacrifice."67 Durmukha the Pāncāla and Atyarâti Jānantapi by the very knowledge of Indra's great anointing conquered the earth, their priests being Brhaduktha and Vāsistha Sâtyahavya respectively. A kind of conflict is however reported between Atyarâti and the priest Vāsistha Sâtyahavya. This Vāsistha, son of Satyahavya said to Atyarâti : " Thou hast conquered entirely the earth on every side : do thou make me great." Then said Atyarâti Jānantapi 44 When I conquer, O Brahman, the Uttara Kurus, then thou wouldst be king of the earth, and I should be thy General." Vāsistha Sâtyahavya replied : 44 That is a place of the gods, no mortal man may conquer it. Thou hast been false to me, therefore I take this from thee." Then Amitratapana Šusmiņa Šaibya, a king, slew Atyarâti Jānantapi, whose strength had been taken away and who had lost his power. Therefore one should not play false with a Brahman who knows thus and has done thus (thinking) 44 Let me not lose my kingdom, nor let breath forsake me."68 66.

The Aitar ey a Ār any aka 69 celebrates Vasistha and Višvāmitra as follows : While their names are, as usual, connected with several hymns and rites,70 the Äranyaka offers useful exegetical comment on their names : Thus Višvāmitra is 44 friend of the Universe " or " one to whom the universe is friend."71 And Vasistha is the best or most excellent of all.72 Višvāmitra is further described as having Indra reveal himself to him. " Indra sat down beside Višvāmitra who was about to recite the hymns of this day. He saying 'This is food,' recited the thousand brhatīs. Thus he went to Indra's dear home. Indra said to him, 4 Seer, thou hast come to my dear home. Do thou, seer, repeat a second hymn.' He saying 4 This is food', recited the thousand brhati verses. Thus he went to Indra's dear home. Indra said to him, 4 Seer, thou hast come to my dear home. Do thou, seer, repeat a third hymn'. He saying 4 This is food,' recited the thousand brhati verses. Thus he went to Indra's dear home. Indra said to him, 4 Seer, thou hast come to my dear home. I give thee a boon.' He said, 44 Let me know thee.' Indra said, 4 I am breath ; thou, seer, art breath ; all creatures are breath ; he that shines is breath. In this form, I pervade all the quarters. This my food is my friend, my support. This is the food of Višvāmitra. I am he that shines.' Thus said he."73 The Äranyaka proceeds to describe the importance of the thousand brhatīs. 44 The consonants are the body, the vowels the souls, the sibilants the breath. Knowing this he became Vasistha (4 most excellent '). Thence took he the name. 69. Edited with introduction, translation, notes etc. by A. B. Keith, Anecdota Oxoniensia, 1909 Oxford. 70. 1.2.2. RV III 47 is composed by Višvāmitra (Tadu Vaisvāmitram). I 4.2. Vasistha's name is associated with the Sūdadohas verse, and again with the Virāj verses (I 5.2) - Virājah samsatyannam vai virājo'nnādyasyāvaruddhyai / Vāsisthena paridadhāti Vasistho'sānīti J 71.

Now Višvāmitra was the friend of all, and all is the friend of him who knows this and of those for whom a Hotr priest, who knows this, recites this hymn (RV III 47). Again in a later chapter : Tasyedam višvam mitram āsīd yad idam kiñca tad y ad asyedam' višva- mitram āsīd yad idam kiñca tasmād Višvāmitras tasmād Višvāmitra ityâcaksata etam èva santam /ai 2.1). 44 Because all whatsoever was his friend, therefore he is Višvāmitra. Therefore they call him who is (prāņa) Višvāmitra." 72.

The SànkMyana Brahmano75 presents Vasistha and Višvāmitra in much the same manner as the AB and Ait. Ā. Višvāmitra is identified with Vāc (Speech) . - Vāg vai Višvāmitraķ ;76 and is associated with certain puronuväkyas, praisas and anupraisas.77 Vasistha and Višvāmitra are together associated with certain invocations.78 Vasistha by himself too is mentioned in connection with several group invocations.79 But noteworthy is what is referred to as Vasistha-yajña. It is a sacrifice performed by Vasistha in order to avenge the death of his son (Šakti) or sons, caused by the Saudāsas. Vasistho'kāmayata80hataputrab prajäyeya prajayä pašubhir abhi Saudā- sān bhaveyam iti sa etam yajñakratum apašyad Vasisthayajñam tam āharat tenäyajata tenestvā präjäyata prajayä pašubhir abhi Saudāsān abhavat tatho evaitad yajamäno yad Vasisthayajñena yajate prajäyate prajayä pašubhir abhi dvisato bhrätrvyän bhavati // 4 When his sons were killed, Vasistha desired : ' I should propagate and should, with progeny and cattle, defeat the Saudāsas'. Then he saw this sacrifice, con- ceived the Vasisthayajña, with that he sacrificed and, having sacrificed propagated, and then with progeny and cattle defeated the Saudāsas. Thus if a sacrificer sacrifices according to Vasisthayajña, he will propagate and with progeny and cattle will conquer the enemies'. 4. The Šānkhāyana Āraņyakasl refers, principally,82 to the incident of Višvāmitra receiving revelation from Indra : a fact borne out by other texts as well.83 " Višvāmitra indeed went to the dear home of Indra by reason of recitation and the performance of vows. To him, said Indra, 4 Višvāmitra, choose a boon '. 74.

The list is interesting not only for many renowned names of ancient tradition but also for the light it throws upon the chronological relation- ship of those eminent personalities. It is significant that Vasistha does not find a place in this series. Perhaps he represents another school. Visvãmitra receives the knowledge directly from Indra and is removed from Brahman only by three generations.

Secondly, they are among the Seven Sages (saptarsis) representing the seven vitals viz . two eyes, two nostrils, two ears and the mouth, which to- gether constitute the prāņas.88 Sage Vasistha is specially glorified inasmuch as he knew the Virāj, even 4 Indra coveted it ' and desired to know the same from the sage. Vasistha communicated the same to him and in return obtained the knowledge of the expiation for the whole Soma sacrifice. For some time, indeed, " the Vasisthas alone knew these utterances, whence only one of the Vasistha family became the Brahman priest. But since nowadays anybody may study them, anybody may now become Brahman."89 Otherwise, the term Vasistha is several times used in an attributive sense. There is, for example, reference to Vasistha-yajña (excellent sacrifice) which Prajāpati performs in order to propagate mankind.90 Agni is the guardian of undisturbed rites and the most wealthy (vasistha^).91 Speech is, indeed, an excellent thing (vāg vai vasisthā).92 Thus, the mention of the office of the Brahman priest being thrown open to all who know the job proves the posteriority of the Šatapatha to the Taittirlya. And be it noted that even at such a late period, the special importance of the Vasisthas was recognised and no ill-will expressed. Vasistha and Visvāmitra are alike members of the priestly hierarchy. 6. The Pancavimša Brãhmana 93 of the Sāmaveda, also known as Tandya- mahābrāhmaņa, records something of value which throws light on the personal history of the two sages, Vasistha and Visvāmitra.

Thus the 4 Krosa '-sãman is attributed to Višvāmitra " By this (sāman), forsooth, Indra (once upon a time) at Indra-kroša yelled : 4 Višvāmitra and Jama- dagni, here are cows '. The Krosa is applied for gaining cattle."94 44 Krosam bhavati / Etena vā Indra Indrakrose Višvāmitra-Jamadgnī imā gāva ityãkrosat pasūnām avarudhyai Krosam kriyate." Similarly, the Rohita-küliya-säma which is to win victory in battle. A legend is related in this connection.95 Višvāmitra once upon a time went with the cart-train of the Bharatas. He made a wager with certain fellows, the Adanti by name, 4 Ye shall win for me this wealth, ye shall fill these carts for me, if these two ruddy ones shall drive up the bank this cart laden with stones.' He thereupon saw these two sāmans ; by means of these, having yoked them, he drove them forward and won the wager. 44 Rohita-kûliyani bhavatyâjijityâyai / Etena vai Višvāmitro rohitâbhyâm rohitakūla ājim ajayat / Višvāmitro Bharatānām manas satyā ayāt so'danti- bhir nāma janatāyām šam präsyate mām mām yūyam astikām jayāthemāni mahyam pûrayâtha yadïmâvidam rohitāvašmācitam kölam udvahata iti sa ete sāmani apašyat tâbhyâm yuktvã prasedhat so udajayat // " (PB XIV 3.11-13). 94. PB XIII 5.14-15. Caland adduces a legend in this connection culled from the Jaiminîya Brāhmaņa (in Auswahl edited by himself, III 237). 4 The Bharatas once upon a time were on one bank of the Sindhu hard pressed by the Iksvākus. With them (i.e. the Bharatas) stayed Višvā- mitra and Jamadagni. Now Indra asked of Bhayada, son of King Asamāti, the two bay steeds which the gods had given him as gift. He did not give them to him. These not having been given, he (Indra) called at Indrakrosa and said 44 Višvāmitra and Jamadagni, acquire ye these cows of the Iksvākus." These two being on the opposite bank heard this. They said to the Bharatas, 4 Indra calls unto us, acquire ye these cows of the Iksvākus, come along let us acquire them.' They answered 4 Then make you two this Sindhu fordable for us.' 4 Then yoke ye your horses.' They yoked and descended into the river. Then these two said, 4 Throw away all your palpūlanīs.' They threw them away. Now a räjanyabandhu, who possessed a palpūlanī bound it beneath the axle of his chariot. Višvāmitra and Jamadagni wished, 44 May this (Sindhu) be fordable for us." Višvāmitra saw this sāman and landed with it. They came into the river addressing these verses (RV 1 11.4-6) and respectfully approached the water. The stream became fordable and they crossed. ...These two having passed behind the cows of the Iksvākus hemmed them in front and acquired the cattle. The legend bears a striking similarity to the famous cross- ing of the Rivers by Sudās, with the help of Višvāmitra who made the rivers fordable at the confluence of Vipāš and Šutudrī (c/. RV III 33). - Vide Caland's translation, p. 324 f. 95. PB XIV 3.11-13. Caland again cites the corresponding version from JB (in Auswahl, III 183) which runs 4 Višvāmitra, in the company of the waggon-train of the Bharatas, encountered the Mahāvrsas. Now there was either on the Gangā or the Yamunâ, a high, steep bank at the oppoiste side. Said the Mahāvrsas, 44 which forsooth, are now those two draught-oxen that will be able to drive up such a high, steep bank ? " Višvāmitra answered, 44 These two ruddy ones of mine." Said the Mahāvrsas, 44 Let us make a wager, if the draught-oxen will drive up this bank, thou shalt fill the cart with wares, but if they do not drive up we shall win thy wares." He agreed to this. The oxen were yoked to a cart laden with barley or rice. Višvāmitra wished, 44 May I win the race," and saw these two sāmans and drove them on. The oxen reached the opposite bank, so Višvāmitra won the race... And because he had won at the bank ( kūla) by means of his two ruddy ones (rohita), therefore these two sāmans are called Rohita-kûlïyas.' - Vide Caland, p. 354 f.</page><page sequence="149">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 271 The first reference to Višvāmitra's association with a kingdom as its lord is met with in this Brāhmaņa. He is said to have performed a four-day rite called 4 Sañjaya,' to obtain victory. "The Jahnus and the Vrcivats quarrelled for the possession of the kingdom. Višvāmitra, the king of the Jahnus saw this rite and practised it. He got the kingdom, the others were deprived of it. One who has a rival should perform it. He who knows this succeeds himself and his rival is defeated." " Visvãmitrasya sañjayafe / Jahnu- Vrcīvanto rāstra āhimsanta sa Višvāmitro Jãhnavo Rājaitam apašyat sa rastram abhavad arāstram itare / Bhrãtrvyavãn yajeta / Bhavatyãtmanã parâ'sya bhrãtrvyo bhavati ya evam veda " // (PB XXI 12.1-4). The sage Vasistha, likewise, saw a number of sāmans. The famous Rathantara is assigned to him. Having concentrated all its greatness, Vasistha chanted it and went to the world of heaven. 4 4 Tasya Vasistho mahimno vinidhãya tena stutvā svargam lokam ait tān sambhrtyodgãyet " ,/96 A certain Vasistha, son of Vīdu praised with a sãman seen by the sage Vasistha, and succeeded in getting a glimpse of heaven. 44 Vāsistham bhavati / Vasistho vā e tena Vaidavah stutvānjasā savrgam lokam apašyat ... "97 Another sāman dear to Vasistha or one that endeared the sage is mentioned. That sāman, in fact, enabled Vasistha to win Indra's favour. And he, who in praising applies the Vasistha-sāman, wins the favour of the deities. 44 Vasisthasya priyam bhavati / E tena vai Vasistha Indrasya premāņam agacchat premāņam devatānām gacchati Vāsisthena tustuvānaķ... "98 Nihava-sāman is another contribution of the sage Vasistha, who on that account became a special favourite of Indra. It is like this : Once upon a time 44 the seers did not see Indra face to face. Vasistha desired : 4 How may I see Indra face to face ? ' He saw this Nihava-sāman and, thereupon, he saw Indra face to face. Indra said to him : 4 I will tell thee a brāhmaņa so that the Bharatas, having thee as their chaplain, may be multiplied, but do not disclose me to the other seers'. He told him those stomabhāgas (sāman-groups), and, 96. PB VII 7-18. Sãyana : tasya rathantarasya mahimno mãhãtmyãni viprakīrņāni vinidhãya viseseņaikatra sthãpya. Contrast Caland's tr.

In his sad bereavement he saw sāmans and performed rites not only to console himself but also to avenge the son's death which was alleged to have been caused by the sons or descendants of Sudās (Saudāsas), under the instigation of Višvāmitra. Thus Vasistha saw the pragãtha : " Indra krátum na a bhara " (RV VII 32.26) and then became rich in progeny and cattle. This pragãtha is for the sake of obtaining progeny. 4 Indra kratum na ābhareti pragātho bhavati / Vasistho vā etam putrahato'pasyat sa prajayâ pašubhiķ prâjâyata yad esa pragãtho bhavati prajãtyai" //10° For the same reason viz. the death of the son and towards the same end viz. progeny and cattle, does Vasistha in another context see what is known as Janitra-sāman, constituting two chants : The janitra is said to come under a more comprehensive category called the Brahma-sāman. 4 4 Vasisthasya Janitram prajäkämäya Brahmasāma kuryât / Vasistho vã etat putrahatas sãmãpasyat sa prajayä pašubhib prãjâyata yad etat sāma bhavati prajãtyai " //101 Finally Vasistha saw a four-day rite called catūrātra and practised it whereby he relieved himself of the sense of defeat and humiliation caused by his son's death. 99. PB XV 5.24. cf. also PB V 4.5. The same legend in TS III 5.2. and KS XXXVII 17. Bharatas are an ancient clan. According to the Nighaņtu, the term is counted among rtvik names (Nigh. Ill 18.1), Supra note 3. 100. PB IV 7.3. On the pragãtha mentioned, compare Sarvā. (p. 25) which says : Saudã- sair agnau praksipyamânah Šaktir antyam pragātham ālebhe (ārebhe) so'rdharca ukte'dahyata / tam putroktam Vasisthah samâpayateti Sãtyâyanakam Vasisthasya èva hataputrasyãrsam iti tāņdakam // The Tāņdaka (i.e. PB IV 7.3) in question, evidently, goes a step forward and says that the bereaved sage saw this pragãtha to make up for the loss, as at were, by obtaining progeny. The legend is alluded to in other texts as well : cf. KS XII 10. TS II 5.2.1, VII 4.7.1 etc. 101. PB VIII 2.3-4.

A certain amount of personal history of these sages is provided inasmuch as in the one case the son's death had had a profound effect upon the father, and in the other, Višvāmitra's kingship of the Jahnus has been expressed and a not inconsistent martial and sportive spirit clearly illustrated by the Indrakroša and Rohitakūla incidents. One may still wonder, with the back- ground of the Samhitā-evidence, whether the kingship of the Jahnus still proves the râjanyatva of Višvāmitra : i.e. whether Višvāmitra belonged to the Ksatriya- varņa. It looks as if that the four varņas had not yet become water-tight compart- ments. There is again, no reference to the sages' mutual hostility. Višvāmitra and Jamadagni are friends, a fact borne out by RV also.103 7. In the Jaiminlya or Talavakãra Upanisad Brāhmaņa ,104 Vasistha and Višvāmitra figure with equal importance. The Uktha is said to belong to Višvā- mitra. 44 Verily, food is all (višva) and breath is friend (mitra). Now Višvāmitra through exertion, through penance, through the performance of vows went unto the dear abode of Indra. And he proclaimed to him that which has come to man here. Now he went for instruction (saying) 4 Light is this uktha'. 4 Light (jyotis) has two syllables, breath (prāņa) has two, food (anna) has two. That same is firmly established in food. Then Jamadagni went for instruction to him (saying) 4 Life (ãyus) is this uktha. Life (âyus) has two syllables, breath two, food two. That same is firmly established in food. Then Vasistha went for instruction to him (saying) 4 The cow (gaufo) is this uktha. That same is just food. For the cow is food." 4 Tad etad Vaišvāmitram uktham / Tad annam vai višvam prāņo mitram / Taddha Višvāmitra^ šrameņa tapasā vratacaryenendrasya priyam dhāmopajagāma / Tasmā u haitat pro vāca yad idam manusyân āgatam / 102.

Again, "Indra said the uktha to Višvāmitra (saying that it is Speech: Vāc)* Therefore the descendants of Višvāmitra worship Speech only. Manu ordained brahman-hood to Vasistha. Therefore they say, Brahman belongs to Vasistha. This also they say, one knowing thus is a brahman-priest ; and who is equal to a Vāsistha knowing thus? " " Vāg iti hendro Višvāmitrāyoktham uvāca / Tad etad Višvāmitrā upāsate vācam eva / Manur ha Vasisthâya brahmatvam uvāca / Tasmād āhur vāsistham eva brahmeti / Tad u vā āhur evamvid eva brahmā / Ka u evamvidam Vāsistham arhatiti / "106 Vasistha is said to promote progeny by means of an after- verse (anumantra) of the stomabhāga, and by reciting it he did obtain abundant progeny and cattle.

The Sadvimsa Brãhmana 108 describes how Indra imparted the Uktha to Višvāmitra and Brahma to Vasistha ; Speech (Vāk) is Uktha and Mind (manas) is Brahma. Mind and Speech are invaluable assets to Sacrifice and its technique. Even so, Vasistha and Višvāmitra are central figures in propounding and perfect- ing the sacrificial cult. Mind and Speech are further graphically represented as the two ruts of the wheels of the chariot namely the Sacrifice. 4 4 Indro ha vai Višvāmitrāyoktham uvāca Vasisthâya brahma, vāg uktham ityeva Višvāmitrāya mano brahma Vasisthâya / Tad vā etad Vāsistham brahma / Api haivamvidam vā Vāsistham vā brahmāņam kurvīta / Tad yathobhayavartaninâ rathena yām yām dišam prārthavate tām tām abhiprâpnotyevam etenobhayavartaninâ yajñena yam kämayate tam abhyašnute " /109 105.

The Gopatha Brāhmaņa 111 of the Atharvaveda speaks of the penance performed by various sages. Vasistha is said to have done it in two places in the midst of the River Vipāš, the places being known as Vasistha-šilā and Krsņa-šilā. Višvāmitra and Jamadagni did penance in a place called Jāmadagna; Agastya in Agastya-tîrtha112 etc. Indra's special favour to Vasistha inasmuch as he reveal- ed to him the stomabhāgas has been described in term similar to those in the Pañcavimsa Brāhmaņa.113 Vasistha's name is further associated with the hinkāra which is sacred to the sacrifice.114 Sacrifice itself is guarded by the different sages : Vāmadeva guarded it in the South, Vasistha in the middle, Bharadvāja in the North and Višvāmitra on all sides. Hence Maitrāvaruņa will not swerve from Vāmadeva, Bhāhmaņācchamsin will not swerve from Vasistha, Acchāvāka will not from Bharadvāja ; and all will stand by Višvāmitra. Thus do the seers zealously guard the sacrifice.115 Finally, Vasistha and Višvāmitra are mentioned as the seers of Sampāta hymns, while a kind of plagiarism is ascribed to Vāmadeva who appro- priated the sampātas first seen by Višvāmitra for himself, whereupon the latter saw fresh ones !116 It will be seen from the above that the Gopatha Brāhmaņa does not perpetrate the so-called tradition of an hostility between Vasistha and Višvāmitra. On the contrary both of them are represented as quite friendly in the domain of sacrifice. People have faith in both and look upon them with respect. And what is more, both are god's favourites. 110. The same idea is well desribed in JUBr. Ill 16 : ay am vāva yajfto yoyam pa vate / Tasya vāk ca manas ca liyesa etan manasã ca vartate / Tasya hotãdhvaryur udgâtetyanyataràm vācā vartanim samskurvanti / Tasmāt te vācā kurvanti / Brahmaiva manasā anyatarãm / Tasmãt sa tūsņīm äste // The sacrifice rests on Speech and Mind. These are the two ruts on which the sacrifice proceeds. The three priests, hotr, adhvaryu and udgātr, look after one of them by means of speech (because they recite aloud the praises and the chants), whereas the Brahman priest contemplates upon the other in mind only ; hence he remains silent. He is responsible for the flawless performance of the rites ; therefore he silently but vigilantly supervises the work of all the others. 111.

Nirukta While explaining the name Saras vati as Speech and a River, Yãska relates briefly the story of Višvāmitra and the Rivers. Tatretihāsam ācaksate Višvāmitra rsiķ Sudāsah Paijavanasya purohito babhūva / Višvāmitrah sarvamitrah ... Sa vittam grhītvā Vipâtchutudryob sambhedam ãyayãv anuyayur itare / Sa Visvãmitro nadîs tustāva gãdhã bhavateti /117 4 In that connection they relate a story. The sage Višvāmitra was priest of king Sudās son of Pijavana. Višvāmitra was a friend to all. Taking his wealth he came to the confluence of Vipāš and Šutudrī ; others followed ; Višvāmitra praised the rivers (and prayed) 4 Do ye become fordable' The circumstances of this miracle are, however, nowhere clearly expresseds Some amplifications may be gleaned from other works. The Brhaddevatā tell, us that Višvāmitra was accompanying Sudās, having been his priest at a sacrifice : Purohitas sannijyãrtham Sudāsā saha yan rsitt / Vipätchutudryos sambhedam šam ityete uvāca ha //118 The Sarvānukramaņi introduces the hymn (RV III 33) merely as a conversation between the rivers and Višvāmitra, who was desirous of crossing - Samvādo nadibhir Višvāmitrasyottitīrsoh.119 Still the questions remain : whose wealth did Višvāmitra take ? and who are those others that followed him ? The old texts have no answer to give. Durga however imagines that the wealth was earned by him in his capacity as priest (paurohityopärjitam) ; and that those who followed him were either his attendants or robbers (anuyayur itare tadanuyäyinas taskarā vā). Säyana, from the above sources reconstructs the story - 44 Purā kila Višvāmitrah Paijavanasya Sudāso rājnab purohito babhūva / Sa ca paurohityena labdhadhanah sarvam dhanam ädäya Vipätchutudryofe sambhedam äyayävanuyayur itare / Athottitirsur Višvāmitro' gādhajale te nadyau drstvottaraņārtham ädyäbhis tisrbhis tustāva " /120 44 In times of yore Višvāmitra became the priest of king Sudās son of Pijavana. He, having obtained wealth from his priesthood gathered up all earnings and came to the confluence of Vipāš and Šutudri ; others followed him. Then desirous of crossing the stream whose waters were deep he praised the rivers to become 117. Nir. II 24 (p. 231 BSS edn.). 118. BD IV 106. 119. Sarvā. ed. Macdonell, p. 15-16. It is strange that Sadguruéisya does not narrate the story. He merely repeats the original - Uttitîrsor Visvämitrasya nadībhis saha samvādo'smin sūkte pratipädyate (Ib. p. 106). 120. Sāyaņa s preface to RV III 33.</page><page sequence="155">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 277 fordable". This warrants a supposition that the people who followed were not friendly; they were perhaps intent on pursuing Višvāmitra and Sudãs who must also have been in the company, as vouchsafed by BD. It is agreed on all accounts, at any rate, that Višvāmitra was the wonder-worker before whom the rivers gave way. Yãska does not refer to any hatred between Vasistha and Višvāmitra. His commentator, however, refuses to comment upon the Rgvedic verse in which the word 44 lodham " occurs. " Lodham " is listed up in the Nighaņtu as one of the sixty-two words121 which are known as anavagatas (not-understood). Explaining this word Yãska quotes the Rgvedic line - 44 lodhám nayanti pášu mányamãnãb " - and says : lodham 44 lubdham rsim nayanti pašům manyamânãh". Durga upon this quotes the verse (RV III 53.23) in full and then refuses to comment upon it ; because 44 the verse in which the word occurs is a Vasistha-hating one ; I am a Kāpisthala- Vāsistha ; hence, I do not explain it."122 This of course, should be regarded as based on a tradition which Yãska did not share. Yãska refers to the birth of Vasistha123 and in that connection comments on the Rgvedic verse 44 Utãsi Maitrã-Varunó Vasistha "124 Vasistha is said to be the son of Mitra and Varuna who once fell in love with Urvaší at her very sight (in a sacrifice). Their semen dropped down and was held in a pitcher of water by the Visvedevas. Then Vasistha was born. The commentator Durga draws attention to the fact that Vasistha had more than one birth ;125 this is also supported by Rgvedic authority.126 Vasistha's loyalty to Indra along with others viz. Parāšara and Satayãtu is stated.127 An interesting parable128 is told of how Vasistha once praised Parjanya for rains. The frogs seconded him, whereby he was pleased and heartily compli- mented them in the following Rk - Samvatsarám šašayānā Brāhmaņā vratacāriņaķ / Vācam Parjányajinvitâm prá maņdūkā avādisuh //129 44 The frogs pour forth aloud their praise which is pleasing to Parjanya, like Brāhmans after lying the whole year in observance of a vow." 121.

He wanted to die ; but the river untied the bonds and he was destined to live. The river was thenceforward named as Vipāš : (Vipāt vipāšanād vã) / Pāsā asyãm vyapãsyanta Vasisthasya mumūrsatah / Tasmãd Vipãd ucyate /130 The real name of the river is Ârjïkîyâ (having its source in the Rjlka mountain ; or flowing straight) ; it was formerly known as Urunjirā (urujalā = full of water).131 Finally, Yãska is impressed with the great qualities for which the Vasisthas were known :132 " Their glory is like the splendour of the Sun; their greatness is vast like that of the ocean ; their swiftness is like that of the Wind and their praises always inimitable." 2. Brhddevatã Mitrïkrtya janã visve yad imam paryupäsate Mitra ityãha tenainam Visvãmitra stuvan svayam //133 " Because all men making friends with him resort to worship therefore Visvãmitra (friend to all) himself praising him calls him Mitra (friend)." One easily sees here a clue to Višvāmitra's own name if not his character. The author of BD appears to commend the sage as a universal friend. Indeed, while praising the Sun-god134 as a friend who urges all men to action as a friend who supports both earth and heaven as a friend who is vigilant in regard to the welfare of those who toil (krstīh), Visvãmitra undoubtedly may have had the God's example for his own emulation or guidance ! And we know from the legends that he always proved to be a friend of the distressed. Of the seven names of the Sun, he the God is reupted to have acquired the name Bhaga because the sage Vasistha praised him so : Udito bhãsayamllokãn imāmš caisa svarasmibhifr / Svayam Vasisthas tenainam rsir āha stuvan bhagam //135 130.

According to Sarvā. the deity of the hymn is Mitra who is generally identified with Sun (see Säyana's com.). In the Brhaddevatā however it appears to be one of the 26 names of Indra, as pointed out by Macdonell (p, 39 of his Tr.; specially note on v. 32). These 26 names happen to coincide almost with those enumerated in Nigh. V 4 and 5. Therefore Mitra, in its derivative sense, may apply to both Indra and the Sun. 135. BD II 62. cf. RV VII 41.2-5.</page><page sequence="157">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 279 44 And he arose illuminating these worlds with his rays : therefore, the seer Vasistha himself, praising him, calls him Bhaga." The text of BD refers to Višvāmitra and Vasistha in a few contexts which are of no significance indeed for the study of their mutual relationship. Thus the character of the Vaisvadeva hymns differs from seer to seer.136 There is narāšamsa in Vasistha's Apri hymns, while there is praise of Tanunapāt in Višvāmitra's.137 The hymns of several seers are characterised by refrains ; but those of Kutsa differ in this regard from those of Bharadvāja, Grtsamada, Vasistha and others.138 That Višvāmitra was first king and then elevated himself to the position of a Brahmarsi is first clearly expressed by BD Prasäsya gām yas tapasãbhyagacchat Brahmarsitām ekašatam ca putrān / Sa Gãthiputras tu jagāda sūktam Somasya metyãgneyam vat pare ca //139 44 The son of Gāthi who. after ruling the earth, attained by penance to the position of a Brahman-seer (Brahmarsi) and obtained a hundred and one sons, uttered the hymn which is addressed to Agni 4 Somasya mā ' and the two following." It is well-known that Višvāmitra saw the whole of the third mandala. Višvāmitra's conversation with the River Vipāš and Šutudri and the successful crossing of their confluence in the company of Sudās have already been considered.140 We may now pass on to other events of the sage's life. According to BD, Višvāmitra was once involved in an incident with the sage Šakti son of Vasistha, at a great sacrifice performed by Sudās. Višvāmitra was forcibly deprived of consciousness ; he sank down unconscious. But to him the Jamadagnis gave speech called Sasarpari, daughter of Brahmā or of the Sun, having brought her from the dwelling of the Sun. Then that Speech dispelled Kušika's loss of intelligence. Sudāsaš ca maháyajñe Šaktinā Gāthisūnave / Nigrhitam balāccetah so'vasidad vicetanaķ / Tasmai brāhmīm tu Saurīm vā namnā vācam sasarparīm / Suryaksayäd ihährtya dadus te Jamadagnayaķ / Kuškānām tatas sā vāg amatim tām apāhanat /141 Sage Višvāmitra goes down to history, as well as his redoubtable adversary Vasistha, on account of what BD styles as Vasistha-dvesinyah which are four 136.

These mantras, though incorporated in the Rgveda-samhitā, the Vasisthas do not hear. Great sin attaches to recite or hear them. Those who recite or listen to them will have their heads split into a hundred bits ; their children will die ; hence the said stanzas should not be uttered. The teachers approve of this course. Parās catasro y ās tvatra Vasisthadvesinyas smrtāb / Višvāmitreņa tāķ proktā abhišāpā iti smrtãti / Dvisaddvesās tu tab proktāb vidyãs caivābhicārikāb / Vasisthās tānna šrņvanti tad ãcãryakasammatam / Kīrtanācchravaņād vāpi mahādosaš ca jâyate / Šatadhā bhidyate mūrdhā kīrtanena šrutena vā / Tēsām bālāk pramiyante tasmāt tās tu na kïrtayet /142 The Brhaddevatā commemorates Vasistha's greatness quite systematically commencing from his very birth. We shall recount the whole pedigree because of its interest. 44 The son of Prajāpati was Marici, Marici's son was the sage Kasyapa. He had thirteen divine wives, the daughters of Daksa : Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālā, Danâyu, Simhikā, Muni, Krodhā, Visvā, Vasisthā. Surabhi, Vinatā and Kadrū by name ; these daughters Daksa gave to Kasyapa. From them, the Gods and Asuras, the Gandharvas, the Serpents, the Rāksasas, Birds, Pišācas, and other classes of beings were produced. Now among these daughters, the one goddess Aditi produced twelve sons. They were - Bhaga, Aryaman, Amša, Mitra and Varuņa, Dhātr and Vidhātr, Vivasvat, Tvastr, Pusan, and also Indra ; the twelfth is called Visņu. Thus that pair was born of her namely Mitra and Varuņa. When they saw the nymph Urvasi at a sacrificial session, the semen of these two Ädityas was effused. It fell into a jar containing water. Now at that same moment, two vigorous ascetics, the seers Agatsya and Vasistha, came into being. The semen however, having fallen in varuous ways - in a jar, in water, on the ground - the sage Vasistha, the best of seers was produced on the ground; while Agastya was produced in the jar, and Matsya, of great brilliance, in the water. Then Agastya, of great glory, arose being the length of a peg only (samyâ). Be- cause he was meted with a measure, he is here called Mânya ; or else (because) the seer was born from a jar. For measurement is made with a jar also ; by jar (kumbha) the designation of a measure of capacity is indicated. Then, as the waters were being taken up, Vasistha was found standing on a puskara (lotus ?). There on every side the Višvedevas supported the puskara. Arising out of that water, Vasistha then performed great austerity. " His name arose with reference to his qualities, (guņataķ), from the root vas expressive of pre-eminence : for he once upon a time, by means of austerity, saw Indra who was invisible to other seers. Indra then proclaimed that he should receive shares in the Soma. This is supported by the Brāhmaņa passage " Rsayo 142. BD IV 117-120. cf. RV III 53. 21-24.</page><page sequence="159">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 281 vā Indrām..." Vasistha and the Vasisthas thus became Brāhmans in the Office of Brahman priest, most worthy of fees in all rites and sacrifices. Therefore one should honour with fees all such descendants of Vasistha who may at any time even today be present at a sacrificial assembly, so says a sacred text of the Bhāl- lavins."143 It becomes clear from the foregoing that the sage Vasistha was of divine origin, that he was favoured by Indra and that he and his tribe obtained universal recogni- tion as Brahman priests. Vasistha's dream is the next important event that BD would relate about him. This topic has been dealt with already in the above pages.144 That a sage of Vasistha's eminence could break into another's house or that he had had to starve for three nights and steal into another's house on the fourth for food are surely things that can happen only in a dream ! It has been clearly said to be a dream in BD - ' Vasisthas svapna ācarat ' - though Sadgurušisya misses the point and adds colour somewhat thoughtlessly. What, however, is important about the hymn is its magical aspect. It is called 'prasvãpinyupanisat', a spell which throws the concerned folk into slumber. Its efficacy as such was tested in the seer's own case ! 143. BD. V 143-159.

Moreover he seems to have been much sinned against; fiends of all sorts oppressed him. BD says - Rsir dadarša rāksoghnam putrašokapariplutafo / Hate putrašate tasmin Saudāsair duķkhitas tādā / Rsis tvāšisam āšāste mā no raksa iti tvrci / * * * Divi cai va prthivyãm ca tathā pālanam atmana ķ/ Ulûkayâtum jahyetân nānārūpān nišācarān / Pañcadasyam tu suktasya astamyãm caiva Vāruņiķ / Duķkhašokaparītātmā šapate vilapanniva / Hate putrašate tasmin Vasistho dutikhitas tādā / Raksobhūtena šāpāt tu Sudāseneti vai šrutife //145 " The seer, when his hundred sons had been slain by the followers of Sudãs, full of pain and overwhelmed with grief for his sons, saw this hymn for the destruction of demons. In the stanza 'mā no raksah,' the seer invokes a blessing ; and protec- tion in heaven and earth on his own behalf. With " Ulûkayâtum " etc., he prays " Slay these night walkers of various froms." In the fifteenth and in the eighth stanzas of the hymn, the son of Varuna (Vasistha), his soul being overwhelmed with pain and grief, utters a curse. Vasistha was at that time pained, as his hundred sons had been slain by Sudāsa who, in consequence of a curse, had been transformed into a demon (raksas) ; such is the sacred tradition." A little discre- pancy confronts us here. Vasistha's hundred sons were killed, no doubt. But by whom ? By the Saudāsas i.e. the followers of Sudãs according to stazna 28 in the above quotation ; or by Sudāsa transformed as a demon, according to stanza 34. We shall see that this incident gets further complicated in later litera- ture, the epics and the Purāņas. 3. Sarvānukramaņī The pedigree of Višvāmitra given by the Sarvā, is noteworthy : Kusikas tvaisirathir Indratulyam putram icchan brahmacaryam cacāra tasyendra eva Gāthī putro jajñe Gāthino Višvāmitrah ; sa trtïyam maņdalam apašyat /146 Kusika son of Isïratha, desirous of obtaining a son equal to Indra, did penance. Indra himself chose to be his son as Gāthī. Gāthin's son was Višvāmitra who saw the third Mandala of the Rgveda. 145. BD VI 28, 31-34. 146. Sarvā. p. 14. Sadgurušisya expands the same in verse - Isīrathasutas tvāsīt Kusiko nāma nāmatah / Indratulyas suto me syād itīcchannakarot tapah / Brahmacaryam tu caratas tasmād Indro'bhyajäyata / Matsamo'nyo na caiva syäd aham evãsya putratām / Gacchāmi samyagevam syãd iti matvā satakratuh / Sa Gāthī nāma Kusikād Isīrathasutād abhūt / Indrarūpād G āt hi nas tu Visvāmitro'pi jajnivān / Trtïyam maņdalam idam tapasā so'tha drstavān //</page><page sequence="161">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 283 RV III 33 is just pointed out as having been seen by Visvāmitra as he was desirous of crossing the river ;147 the circumstances are not mentioned. So also the two stanzas relating to Sasarparī are indicated without any reference to the connected event.148 But the commentator supplies the want.

Visvāmitra's adoption of Šunassepa as the eldest of his sons under a new name Devarāta is of course a great event. While the Brhaddevatā is silent about it. Sarvā. refers to it briefly while introducing the Šunassepa hymns (RV I 24-30) : Kasya panconājigartiš Sunaššepas sa krtrimo Vaisvāmitro Devarātaķ /150 The legend however is elaborately narrated by Sadgurušisya;151 but it is un- necessary to review the same here as it has been done already in the preceding chapter on Šunassepa. The birth of Agastya and Vasistha is mentioned while introducing the Agastya hymns commencing with RV 1.166 : Mitrā Varunayor diksitayor Urvasim apsarasam drstvā vāsativare kumbhe reto'patat tato'gastya-Vasisthâvajâyetâm /152 But the incident of Vasistha's son Šakti being consigned to the fire by the followers of Sudās receives a fuller treatment in the Sarvā. and its commentary. The Sarvā. savs : Saudāsair agnau praksipyamânas Šaktir antyam pragātham ālebhe so'rdharca ukte'dahyata / Tam putroktam Vasisthas samäpayateti Sätyä- yanakam Vasisthasaiya hataputrasyärsam iti Tāņdakam /153 Sadgurusisya weaves a graphic narrative out of this skeleton ; his source is not traceable.

The young son being killed by the enemies lying in wait, when he was unguarded and specially when he was engaged in gathering flowers for worship, provides a background which is distinctly epic in style and conception. Vasistha' s paternal care and anxiety are qualities too tame to be in conformity with the vigorous potentiality of a priest who was the guiding star of an advancing civilisation. It is said that the assassins were surrounded or supported by friends directed by Višvāmitra. This entirely lacks authority or corroboration. Writing so late as the 12th century A.D. Sadgurusisya had deeply imbibed the popular tradition (reflected in the epics and the Purāņas) that Vasistha and Visvãmitra were inveterate enemies of each other and that they never lost any opportunity to wreak vengeance against each other. Hence whatever Vasistha's misfortune, Višvāmitra was the cause and vice versa . The fact that, as time rolls on, tradition also varies is borne out by the diverg- ence between the Šātyāyanaka and the Tāņdaka.155 Of the two rks in question, the story alleges that Šakti had seen or composed the first hemestich only when 154. Sarvâ. pp. 130-31. vide note 18 supra . 155. In fact 4 Indra krátum na ā bhara ' (RV VII 32.26-) is uttered by Vasistha for the sake of progeny (prajãtyai). It is part of janitra-sãma. Observe that according to Nîtimaftjarî of Dyà D vi veda, áakti did not die ; he praised Indra and was saved. See infra.</page><page sequence="163">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 285 he was consumed by the fire. The father came and saw the situation. Inspite of grief, he exerted himself to complete the dvrca. If only we go into the content of the two verses, we will be disappointed to find not a trace of sorrow reflected in it. Granting that Šakti had begun to compose an excellent hymn to Indra - a very worthy start indeed - índra krátum na a bhara Pitá putrébhyo yáthã /16e 44 Bring us wisdom. O Indra, as a father (imparts the same) to the sons." - It is indeed strange that the bereaved father's completion of the dvrca does not reflect any grief and, therefore does not appear to have been composed with a heavy heart at all. This is how Vasistha saw - Šiksā lio asmín Puruhūta yãmani Jivà jyótir asimahi // Mã no ájnãtã vrjánã durãdhío Másivãso áva kramub / Tváyã vayám pravátás šásvatir Apó'ti sūra tarāmasi //157 44 Teach us at this sacrifice, O Puruhūta, so that we, living beings, shall enjoy light. Let no unknown, wicked, malignant, malevolent enemy overpower us. Protected by you, may we cross over many waters." We have thus to conclude that the two mantras in question betray no clue to Vasistha's misfortune. We have only to respect the tradition. The Sarvā. and the commentary do not throw fresh light on the Vasistha- dvesinyab ; the latter reflects the information given by BD and reproduces one of the verses168 (Šatadhā bhidyate mūrdhā etc.). The prasvãpinyupanisat has already been dealt with.159 The last hymn of the seventh mandala is called Rãksoghna i.e. 44 the demon- killer," which is described as Sãpãbhisãpaprãyam160 full of oaths and imprecations." The text and the commentary are brief in their notice of this ; there is no reference to the loss of Vasistha's hundred sons, which the BD and the several Brāhmaņa texts point out quite frequently.161 4.

A strange interpretation, indeed, to say that Visvãmitra robbed Sudãs of his wealth ? And what was the grief that befell Visvãmitra, after all ? He carried away the wealth that he had earned as priest ; the rivers Vipãs and Šutudrī enabled him to cross over their confluence ; and he and Sudãs were quite safe :163 Having thus cast a slur on the bona, fides of Visvãmitra. witness the next lesson that the author draws : Somapãnam vinã nrnãm brãhmanatvam na vidyate / Yadartham Gãdhijo yastum dhanam hrtvãvadannadib //164 And what does he tell the rivers ? 44 Aham kutumbabharanãd atiriktena dhanena somam sampãdayisyãmíti !

It may mean 4 king ' or, in an adjectival sense, 4 able.' Though quite able, Visvãmitra assumed the rôle of a flatterer and successfully crossed the rivers. Quite a problem is raised by the following dictum- Gunaprasamsayã kãryam mahatãm mānavardhanam / Ksipto'gnāvaribhiš Šaktir nendraprasamsãyã mrta b//166 4 Great people should be further elevated in estimation by praising their virtues ; it is thus that though thrown to the fire by the enemies, Šakti was not dead because of his praise of Indra'.

The Brhaddevatá167 does not refer to Šakti's death but refers to the death of Vasistha's hundred sons caused by the Saudāsas. The Sarvā. states that Šakti was reduced to ashes,168 having been thrown to the fire by the Saudāsas. Dya's rendering of the story is unauthenticated. The moral that the author propounds is too commonplace to require the remote author- ity of a Vedic event. Strange things are conceived by this author Dviveda. For example, - Krtāparādhaputrāņām anyâyo na pitur hrdi / Pâsadyumnasya yajñasya hantīms tustãva Vāruņiķ //169 Sons' wrongs do not matter to the parent is a dictum in Dyâ's conception - 4 Delin- quency on the part of sons will not affect the heart of the father. Vasistha praised his sons who put an end to Pâsadyumna's sacrifice'. The story is that Indra was present at Pâsadyumna's sacrifice and was about to partake of the Soma juice which was being pressed. Just then the sons of Vasistha, officiating at another sacrifice, pronounced such fulsome praise as made Indra leave the ready cup of Soma at Pâsadyumna's and come away to the one conducted by the Vāsisthas.170 Granting the efficacy of the prayers of the Vāsisthas, one is compelled to question the soundness of Indra's action - Indra a god who should yield to persuasion and betray one devotee to prefer another. Convenient shelter for unlawful actions is provided by the following advice - Kutumbe pïdyamâne tu dharmān nekseta dharmavit / Vasisthas sväpayämäsa yanmuse Vāruņam janam I/111 4 The knower of Law should not observe the laws when the family is in distress. Vasistha sent all Varuna's people to sleep when he went there to steal ' : We shall amuse ourselves further by the author's comment - Apyakäryasatam krtvā bhartavyâ ityuktatvát / Yasisthavad akrtyam api krtvā bhūsaņācchādanaib kutumbam tosayet /172 4 Because it is said that (the family) shou'd be protected even by performing a hundred unwarranted deeds. One should please the family by means of ornaments and clothes, even committing a crime like Vasistha.' This recommendation is opposed to the original statement which permits a man to commit a crime when only the family is in distress. But Dyā means to suggest that even luxuries 167.

HARIYAPPA may be provided by stealing. He misses on the one hand that according to Brhaddevatã, Vasistha was experiencing a dream and on the other, according to Sadgurušisya,173 he entered Varuna's house because he was afflicted with hunger. It is perhaps a third dimensional development to bring in the family also, as a plea and excuse for crime I The wise man must try to free himself from false allegations, just as Vasistha cleared himself by swearing and cursing : Mithyãpavãdabhangãya prayateta vicaksaņah / Vasisthas sapatham krtvā sāpam datvāmalo'bhavat //174 Vasistha happened to be once charged as 4 yãtudhãna' by a demon who posed himself as Vasistha. The situation becamè sò embarrassing that the real sage had to swear his identity and then curse the evil demons. Sãyana informs us as follows : atra kecid āhuh - 175 Hatvã putrasatam purvam Vasisthasya mahātmanab / Vasistham rāksaso'si tvam Vãsistham röpam āsthitah // Aham Vasistha ityevam jighāmsū rāksaso'bravit / Atrottarä reo176 drstã Vasistheneti nab srutam // Thus attacked by the Rãksasa who killed his hundred sons and who disguised himself as the sage, Vasistha had to swear Adyã murïya yádi yãtudháno ásmi Yádi väyus tatápa pûrusasya / Ádhã sá viraír daáábhir víyúyã Yó má mógham yãtudhãnétyãha //177 44 This day let me die if I am 4 Yãtudhãna ' or if I ever injured the life of a man ; and he who falsely called me 4 yãtudhãna ' shall be bereft of ten heroes (sons)." The same incident affords another moral - It is the nature of bad people to revile the good ; wicked indeed are those who called Vasistha a 4 yãtudhãna ' : Durjanãnãm svabhâvo'yam bhrsam nindanti yat satah / Vasisthasya durãtmãno yãtudhãneti ye'bruvan //178 173.

To sum up : In these ancillary works which hold aloft the Vedic teaching and tradition, Vasistha and Visvãmitra, as usual, enjoy high reputation for their knowledge of the divine and for their superhuman achievements. Regarding their mutual relationship viz. enmity, there is direct expression in the Brhad- devatā, followed by the Sarvā., the commentators Durga and Sãyana, and finally the Nitimañjarl. Only Yãska does not refer to it, though he had opportunity to do so while commenting on the word 44 lodha " which occurs in the verse regarded as a curse against the Vasisthas. It may therefore be concluded that this Vasistha-Visvãmitra feud acquired wide publicity and implicit belief by the time of the Brhaddevatã (400 B.C.)180 so much so that society was prone even to expunge from the Vedic text the few verses known as 4 Vasistha-dvesinyafc." For according to BD. 44 they were pronounced by Visvãmitra as imprecations ; the Vasisthas do not hear them ; with full approval of the teachers. Great sin arises from reciting or listening to them. With them recited or heard, the head splits into a hundred bits ; their children will die. Therefore one should not recite those verses."

The main events in the former's life are collected in the first book (Bālakāņda 51-65). By the time of the Râmayana, Visvāmitra impresses us as a great Brahmarsi of established reputation. He is one of the Seven Sages, who are Brahma's favourites and whose duty is to propagate righteousness in the world, to conduct sacrifices for public weal and also to cause, through proper agencies and timely intervention, the destruction of all evil. In this last aspect their task was to extirpate the demons who were a manace all over. Through so much of roughing of life in the mundane world and so much of austerity and penance to enjoy communion with the Absolute, these sages had become embodiments of peace and righteousness, always striving for the best fulfilment of God's purpose and man's emancipation. They were God's agents on earth as it were. Thus came Visvāmitra, once upon a time, to pay a visit to King Dašaratha of Ayodhyã (18). 185 Sage Vasistha was the latter's priest. Evidently the two sages had transcended all feelings of discard between themselves and knew and respected each other's merit.186 So Visvāmitra was received with great reverence and warmth. After the usual formalities, the holy sage proposed to take the young prince Rāma to guard his sacrifice against the attacks of Mārīca and Subāhu (19). With great dismay the king begged him to leave the Prince behind ; in fact, his tender affection worked itself to such an extent as to drive him to refuse to comply with the wishes of the holy sage (20). Visvāmitra got angry ; but, the far-sighted Vasistha intervened. For, being omniscient, he realised the high- minded purpose behind Višvāmitra's proposal. Dašaratha had no alternative but to yield. Both princes, Rāma and Laksmaņa were handed over to Visvāmitra (22). During the short period when Visvāmitra had the princes under his care, it may be discerned that he gave them the best training which stood them in good stead later in their life's ordeal. He instructed them in the most efficacious vidyäs, namely Bālā and Atibalā,187 and also imparted to them the knowledge of rare and powerful weapons.188 Their strength and mettle were also put to the test in the fight with Tātakā189 and then with Mārīca and Subāhu.190 An acquaintance in 185.

Vasistha pays handsome compliment when he says of Visvāmitra - Esa vigrahavān dharma esa vïrya vatám varah / Esa vidyãdhiko loke tapasas ca parãyaiiam // (21.10) . . .Tenãsya munimukhyasya dharmajñasya mahātmanah / Na kiñcid astyaviditam bhūtam bhavyam ca Rāghava // Ibid, 19» 187.

The stories related by Višvāmitra are of absorbing interest ; they well speak of the sage's vast knowledge and experience. Above all the far-sightedness of the sage proved itself in the marriage at Janaka's capital between Rāma and Sitā. The Ahalyä incident191 and that of lifting the Šiva-bow192 inspired the future Saviour with confidence. Thus we see that Višvāmitra very nobly discharged his obligations - if indeed they were obligations - to Dašaratha for having spared the services of Prince Rāma ! Višvāmitra's past history is recorded as follows : Seated on the banks of the Soņā in the company of other sages, on their way to Janaka's sacrifice, Višvāmitra, in reply to Rama's question regarding the country through which they were passing, described his own pedigree.193 Kuša of gerat penance was the son of Brahma, and he got four sons through Vaidarbhï - namely Kušāmba, Kušanābha, Asūrtara- jasa and Vasu. Kušāmba founded the famous ancient city of Kaušāmbī. Kušanābha built the city called Mahodaya, Asurtarajasa built Dharmäranya, and Vasu founded Girivraja (Magadha). Now Kušanābha got one hundred daughters through Ghrtāci, they being subsequently married to Brahmadatta of Kãmpilya. Kušanābha then, performed a sacrifice for obtaining a son (putrakāmesti) and got, as reward a son named Gādhi. Višvāmitra was the son of Gādhi, who had a daughter also, called Satyavati. Satyavat! married sage Rcika and ascended heaven bodily along with her husband. She then reappeared as a great river called Kaušikī. Višvāmitra made his permanent abode on her banks ; but just now had come to Siddhāšrama to perform the ten-night sacrifice. True to this statement we see that after Rāma's marriage, Višvāmitra repairs to the Northern Mountains (jagāmottaraparvatam), to his old residence.194 Brahmā I Kuša married Vaidarbhi I i ~~~ r " ~ " i ; i Kušāmba Kušanābha Asurtarajasa Vasu I I ~ I (through Ghrtāci Gādhi 100 daughters married | Brahmadatta of Kãmpilya | j Satyavâtï Višvāmitra (married Sage Rcika) became R.

Having learnt of his mother Ahalyä's redemption by the grace of Šri Rāma and in a spirit of thankfulness to Višvāmitra for having been instrumental therein, Šatānanda describes to the princes the great exploits of the sage. For many thousand years did Višvāmitra of great glory rule the Earth. In one of his victorious marches, he, with all his army and retinue, met the sage Vasistha in his hermitage. After the formal reception, Vasistha invited the royal guest to partake of his hospitality. Višvāmitra and his entire following were lavishly entertained, each one according to his taste, and were extremely pleased. All this miracle was accomplished by the one divine cow which was devoted to Vasistha. Such a wonderful thing - a gem indeed fit to be in royal possession196 Višvāmitra begged to have in lieu of a hundred thousand cows, horses, elephants, chariots, gold and precious stones. Vasistha would not part with the sacred cow for all this world. But the king demanded and tried to take her forcibly. Her own divinity supported by the sage's power of penance made it impossible for the royal intruder to gain his object. Thwarted again and again, Višvāmitra felt most humiliated and began to smart under defeat and disgrace when all his martial glory proved absolutely of no avail (I 54-55). It is said that during the battle, a hundred of Višvāmitra's sons attacked Vasistha with a variety of weapons, but they were all in no time reduced to ashes by a mere " hunkāra " from Vasistha (1 55.5 f.). Leaving the kingdom in charge of his sons,197 Višvāmitra did penance at the foot of the Himälayas to propitiate God Mahādeva, who ultimately granted him all the weapons available on earth at the command of gods and demons, Yaksas and Gandharvas, and all. Armed fully in this manner, Višvāmitra came back to wreak vengeance against his adversary. The hermitage was all destroyed ; Vasistha accepted the challenge and with the help of his holy staff, set at naught the entire stock of his deadly weapons. Višvāmitra was further humiliated with this defeat, so much so he burst out. Dhig balam ksatriyabalam brahmatejobalam balam / Ekena brahmadaņdena sarvāstrāņi hatāni me //198 195. Ibid. I 51. 18-19.

Višvāmitra had innumerable sons, evidently. A hundred were killed by Vasistha. We shall see later that while he was doing penance he got other sons Havispanda, Madhuspanda and others. The latter name reminds us of Madhucchandas, the Rgvedic seer. See fn. 92 of previous chapter. 198. Rãm.

But he did not free himself from his hatred to Vasistha. Accompanied by the queen-consort, he went to the southern region and did severe ptnance. Here were born to him sons, namely Havispanda, Madhuspanda, Drdhanetra and Mahãratha. After a thousand years, God Brahma declared his recognition of Višvámitra as a Royal Saint (Rãjarsi). Disappointed, Višvámitra set himself upon further austerities.199 Meanwhile came Trišaňku, King of Ayodhyã, seeking his help. It occurred to him once that he should sacrifice in such a manner as would elevate him bodily to heaven. Vasistha, of course, he approached for conducting such a sacrifice. Vasistha said such a thing is impossible. Then he approached Vasistha's sons who were doing penance in the south.200 They also replied in the negative, whereupon Trišaňku announced his intention to find other means of realising his object. The Vasisthas became angry and cursed him to become a caņdāla (an outcast). Overnight he was transformed and his counsellors and retinue ran away from him. Alone but determined, Trišaňku came to Višvámitra and appealed for help in order to realise his object : "Fate, I think, is more powerful, man's strength is of no avail. Fate weighs over all and is the last resort. (I have thus been reduced to a miserable condition by Fate). Please therefore redeem me from ill Fate, by means of human endeavour." Daivam eva param manye paurusam tu nirarthakam / Daivenãkramyate sarvam daivam hi parama gatib / ...Daivam purusakāreņa nivartayitum arhasi //201 The sage was much moved to see the king's condition and it is not strange if his own frustration was also responsible to goad him on to espouse the cause of the distressed. And so Višvāmitra resolved to fulfil the king's wish. But- - Ksatriyo yãjako yasya candãlasya višesatafc / Katham sadasi bhoktāro havis tasya surarsayah / Brāhmaņā vā mahātmāno bhuktvā cāņdālabhojanam / Katham svargam gamisyanti Višvāmitreņa pālitāļi /202 - Such doubts naturally would arise and the Vāsisthas did level the charge when the invitation for the sacrifice was extended to them. An outcast is to sacrifice, for whom a Ksatriya is the priest, how can the gods and the rsis partake of the oblations in the assembly? And the revered Brāhmans having enjoyed the hospitality given by an outcast, can they attain heaven under the protection of a Višvāmitra ? The insolence of this challenge was unbearable. Višvámitra cursed them all into a life of degradation for seven hundred births etc. By dint of his penance, the sacrifice was conducted according to rules ; but the gods did not 199. Ibid.

Filled with rage, Višvāmitra declared the gift of all the merit of penance that he had so far earned and commanded Trisañku straightaway to fly to heaven. He did so, as all the assembly could see. But there in heaven Indra and the gods said that there was no place for him there ; and that, moreover he was condemned by the curse of his preceptor. Hence he should fall head downwards. Falling down he cried again to Višvāmitra for protec- tion. Then the sage grew terribly wrathful and, exerting all his supernatural powers, commanded him to stop there only in mid-air and began to create a separate heaven as if he were the Creator himself. Thus came into existence a separate group of Seven Sages and a Separate group of stars, etc. In a fit of anger, he began to proclaim : " Anyam Indram Karisyãmi loko vã syãd anindrakafe " 44 I will produce another Indra or the world shall go without him !" In this grave situation, came forth all the gods, demons and sages to pacify Višvāmitra. They struck a com- promise that Trisañku and the new creation be recognised where they were as divinities outside the path of Vaisvānara (Rām. I 60). Višvāmitra realised after the storm that his penance had been so obstructed in the South ; hence he moved on to the west to pursue his austerities near Puskara. Meanwhile an incident happened in Ayodhyâ. The then king Ambarisa began to sacrifice. Indra stole the victim (pasu). Either it had to be recovered and sacrific- ed or a human substitute found. In this situation the king wandered about and found the sage Rcika willing to part with a son of his, named Šunaššepa for the price of a hundred thousand cows. We saw in the previous chapter how Šunaššepa was taken by Ambarisa, how, on the way at Puskara, the young ascetic secured the help of Višvāmitra, in the shape of two gāthās to be recited at proper time and how in the end Šunaššepa was released by the gods etc.203 Višvāmitra observed penance at Puskara for a thousand years at the end of which God Brahmā appeared and pronounced him a Rsi (I 63.2). Seeing that the goal was yet far, Višvāmitra resumed austerities. But this time an impediment was placed by the Apsaras Menakā, of exquisite beauty, who came to bathe in the Puskara. The sage gave in to cupid's call and invited the nymph to live with him in the hermitage. What more did Menakā want than a success in her trade ? Ten years elasped before the Rsi realised his folly. He dismissed Menakā however with sweet words and wended his way to the Northern Mountain. There on the banks of the Kaušikī he did severe penance for thousands of years, which arrested the attention of all. Then, on the recommendation of all gods and sages, God Brahmā welcomed him as a Maharsi. His bid for the title of a Brahmarsi was not favoured because he had not yet obtained full control over his senses (I 63). Thus, again, Višvāmitra had to return to penance, with renewed vigour and severity. With uplifted arms, supportless and subsisting on mere air, he entered 203. Vide ch. III on Sunassepa. fn. 76. cf. Räm. I 61 and 62.</page><page sequence="173">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 295 upon another thousand-year austerity. In summer he observed the vow in the midstof five fires (four on four sides and one, the Sun-god, above) ; in the monsoons he stood in the open and in winter he remained in water day and night. Great concern was expressed in heaven, seeing such austerity on the part of Visvãmitra. Indra decided to put him to the test and, this time, the onerous duty fell to the lot of the Apsaras Rambhā. Though she knew the risk, she had to obey Indra and succeeded in diverting the ascetic's attention by means of her charming beauty and sweet melody. But the sage soon realised that she was another trap set by Indra, again, and in rage, cursed her to ten thousand years of existence as a mountain (64). Giving vent to his anger in this manner, he found that he had suffered frustration once more. Finally, we see Visvãmitra embark upon the severest type of mortification and penance. He left the Northern regions and went to the East. For a thousand years the sage was engaged in very severe austerities and pledged to silence. He was reduced to a niere stick at the end. Inspite of obstructions he never gave in for anger. At the end of the thousand years the vow of silence and starvation ended, and the sage would have a morsel of food on that day. Just when he was to partake of it, Indra in the guise of a divija came and aksed for it. Without a moment's hesitation he gave all the food to the Brahman. When nothing remained he did not mind nor said a word, but straightaway entered the last phase of his penance which was neither to eat nor even to breathe. Years lapsed and the morti- fication was such as the sage's head began to emit fumes. It was realised on all hands that he had stood the test. Brahmā came with all the gods and felicitated him as a BRAHMARSI. Visvãmitra paid homage to the God in all humility, but demanded that the Vedas, the sacred OM and Vasat should favour him and that Vasistha should openly acknowledge his elevation. That of course Vasistha did with great pleasure. For when persons perceive Divine Light, there can be no bone of contention at all among them (65). Those present listened to Visvāmitra's past history with wrapt attention and amazement. Next day the great Bow of Šiva was shown to Rāma, who with permis- sion, lifted it up with ease. The bow incidentally gave way. Rāma's performance was wonderful. As Janaka had avowed, arrangements were immediately set on foot to celebrate the marriage of Sita with Rāma. Fleet-footed messengers were sent to Ayodhyâ with invitations to king Dašaratha and all his train to come to Mithilā. Needless to say that it was a grand celebration. Vasistha and Visvãmitra having met again moved only as friends. With the former's approval, Visvãmitra moved for the marriage of all the four sons of Dasaratha at the same time with the daughters of Janaka and his brother Kusadhvaja. After the great event, Visvã- mitra bidding farewell to the two kings returned to the Northern Mountains (66.73). Before evaluating the Višvāmitra-stories that appear in the Râmãyana, one point requires to be carefully remembered. From the point of view of critical scholarship, it is held that the first and the last books (i.e. Bāla and Uttara Kāņdas)</page><page sequence="174">296 H. L. HARIYAPPA are not genuina to the original poem. Even so the narrative in question is a later interpolation. Granting this, nevertheless, these stories have their own value because they do stand anterior to many portions of the Mahãbhãrata, and most of the Purāņas. For, according to Winternitz,204 4 it is probable that the Rãmãyana had its present extent and contents as early as towards the close of the second century A.D." Reserving a comparative estimate of these chapters to a subsequent section, it must be said in appreciation that in no other work do we get a connected account of the events of Visvamitra's life. In itself the account provides a consistent biography of the sage, sufficient to portary in correct outline a great personality of Ancient Bhārata. Vasistha is the well-known priest of the Iksvãku race. He is naturally held in high veneration. One finds that in the Rãmãyana, there is not much of an outstanding nature in the life of the sage. His sincere devotion to the best interests of the royal house of Ayodhyã is evident. Sage Vãmadeva seems to be in close association with him. Other sages like Jãbãli, Kãsyapa and even Visvāmitra appear on occasions only. By the time of the epic, the personalities of the sages are made up. They are almost a type ; they have had a great past with established holiness and reputation. The Creative period or the period of growth in the life and profession of the sages and the priests appears to have ended. They enjoy universal recognition as promoters of social well-being and divine grace. Their ultimate goal was Emancipation through penance, their earthly duty was to spread good- will and help the destruction of evil which harassed the world in the form of fiends and demons. VI MAHÄBHÄRATA The theory of later interpolations notwithstanding, it must be conceded that the main theme of the Rãmãyana is allowed to run smoothly without being inter- rupted by endless stories, discourses and disputations, as is the case with the other epic, the Mahãbhãrata. Between the two epics, the growth of which was surely simultaneous for a few centuries at least, all efforts at elaboration seem to have concentrated on the Mahãbhãrata. Ultimately it became a magnum opus whose grandeur in volume and variety has never been, nor is ever likely to be, surpassed. All that was popular in tradition as regards learning, legend, philosophy, statecraft, and the temporal and spiritual life of the land, came to be incorporated in it. We shall therefore look for exhaustive information in this work about Visvāmitra and Vasistha, their mutual relationship as well as their individual greatness. The Age of the Mahãbhãrata envisages a state of fulfilment that crowned the austerities of the Rsis. Sages and ascetics pursuing a life of renunciation and seclusion in the forest abodes is still a familiar feature of the Mahãbhãrata life. 204. C/. Winternitz, HIL Vol. I (Calcutta) p. 516.</page><page sequence="175">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 297 But Vasistha and Višvāmitra and others of their category belonged to the hoary past as it were. By virtue of their penance, they had achieved a kind of omni- science, they were immortal. On all occasions of great moment they would be present with Indra, Brahma and other gods. Thus we find numerous references in the Mbh. to the fact that Vasistha and Višvāmitra were among the Seven Sages (Saptarsis) who generally reside in the North.205 The following were present, for instance, at the time of Arjuna's birth : Sapta caiva maharsayafc - Bharadvājah Kašyapo Gautamaš ca Visvämitro Jamadagnir Vasisthab / Yaš codito Bhāskare'bhūt praņaste So'pvatrātrir bhagavān ājagāma // (I 123.51) They were again among those who surròunded Bhisma,206 when he was lying on the bed of arrows. Vasistha's name is specially associated with Bhisma, who obtained from him the knowledge of the Vedas and their branches (vedāngas)207 and who is described as ( Vasistha-šiksita) Vasistha's pupil.208 This looks somewhat strange when we are told that Bhisma was one of the Vasus, named Dyaus, born on earth on account of Vasistha's curse, the offence being that in one of their perambulations, Dyaus caused Vasistha's sacred cow (homadhenu) to be taken away from the sage's hermitage.209 Vasistha cursed the Vasus saying that they 205.

He would meet Death by his own will (Ibid. XII 37.8-16). In another context Krsņa pays him great compliment. He urges Yudhisthira to visit Bhisma on his bed of arrows and learn from him higher knowledge : Tasminnastamite Bhīsme Kauravāņām dhurandhare / JAãnãnyastam gamisyanti tasmāt tvãm codayämyaham // 1 Cãturvidyam cãturhotram cãturâáramyam èva ca / Rājadharmāmš ca nikhilãn prcchainam prthivípate // (XII 46.22-23). 209.

Story goes on to say that the Vasus prevailed upon the divine river Ganga, that she, having borne them to king Šantanu, should throw them into the water, except the eighth. This eighth child was Devavrata otherwise known as Bhfsma.210 Vasistha and Visvãmitra are mentioned among the great sages who expect Yudhisthira to visit them during his pilgrimage.211 With the sage Lomaša for his guide, the exile king visited their āšranias, which may be regarded as their permanent abodes for all time.212 Situated as these were on river banks, they were rendered holy by the austerities of the saints and were reputed as holy places of pilgrimage.213 Ãcârya Droņa invoked the blessings of Vasistha and Visvãmitra on Duryodhana for a victory over Arjuna.f14 Later as the Great Battle progressed, Vasistha and Visvãmitra were among the Seven Sages who came to carry away the departed Droņa to Heaven.215 The Bisastainyopanisat (the mystery of the theft of the lotus stalk) records a peculiar experience for the Seven Sages who went round on a tour. They were once confronted by a Yâtudhânï who intending to kill them, put them to a test when they were all hungry and thirsty and wanted to refresh themselves with the lotus stalks and water in a lake over which she kept watch. Each one of the party was to announce his or her name, (Arundhatl also accompanied them), which was done with a certain sense of humour. Incident- 210. Ibid I 96. 15-19.

The sages figure again in a similar funny incident which may be called " Puskarastainya " (stealing of the lotus), but designated ' Šapathavidhi ' in the books. Here again comes Indra to solve the mystery. The sages of earth and heaven swore by many things sacred to say that they did not commit the theft of the puskara. Indra was the thief, of course, and apologised in the end that he devised this incident in order to hear from them the acts and principles of Dharma, by which they swore, but which, as the world could realise, constituted the basis of all righteousness.218 Višvāmitra is mentioned among departed kings, who lived a glorious life on earth, performed sacrifices, and ascended heaven, as enumerated by Sañjaya to Dhrtarāstra, so that he might take consolation in his sad bereavement.219 Further, Višvāmitra as a king who became a Brahmarsi by his austere penance is often times remembered in the Mahābhārata.220 He is also credited with doing a good 216.

Yama, the God of Dharma, appearing as a dog is a familiar feature. The dog that followed Yudhis^hira in his final journey was Dharma himself. In the present context it happens that the wandering mendicant (Šunassakha) was accompanied by a dog. In reality he was Indra in disguise, and Indra is named Šunāsīra which has some Vedic basis. It is interesting to study the semantic history of the words Šunam and svan. An attempt is made in the foregoing chapter on Šunassepa. 218. Mbh. XIII 94. Here also was a party on pilgrimage, but consisted of royal saints as well as the Brahman saints. Indra said in the end - Na maya bhagavan lobhāddhrtam pus- karam adya vai / Dharamāms tu šrotukāmena hrtam na kroddhum arhasi // 219. Mbh. I 1.227 (Visvāmitram amitraghnam Ambarlsam mahābalam).

This appears to be an anomaly, however. The context is Indra deputing Menakā to obstruct Visvāmitra's penance ; Menakā pleads fear of a sage of such attainments. Višvāmitra became a Brahmarsi only after transcending earthly passions. Here he succumbs to Menakā's blandishments and begets Šakuntalā, the immortal heroine of Kālidāsa's masterpiece. Compare, further, (a) Mbh. I 137.14 (Višvāmitra is an example of Brãhmanas born of Ksatriyas : Ksatriyebhyas ca ye jātā Brāhamņās te ca te srutāh / Visvãmitraprabhrtayah prāptā brahmatvam avyayam // (b) I 175,47-48. By means of penance Višvāmitra obtained success, having paralysed the worlds with his brilliance ; he attained Brāhmanhood, what is more, partook of the soma in Indra's company (Apibacca tatas somam lndreņa saha Kausikah). (c) III 87.13, 15-17. It was on the banks of the Kausikï that Višvāmitra, rich in penance, became a Brahman.

But Svahā, daughter of Daksa, who had where he quaffed soma with Indra and declared that he a ksatriya had risen high to become a Brāhmaņa (Kânyakubje'pibat somam Indreņa saha Kauáikah / tatah Ksatrãd apākrāmat Brāhmaņo'smīti cābravlt //).

It is said that Viávãmitra in the final stages of his austerities stood the test of Dharma who appeared in the guise of Vasistha ; from the state of Ksatriya, Viávãmitra attained the state of a Brāhmaņa (Ksatrabhãvãd apagato brâhmanatvam upãgatah / Dharmasya vacanāt prīto Viávâmitras tathà'bhavat //).

Sindhudvīpa and Devãpi aíso became Brāhmaņas at this holy place. (/) XIII 3.2 ; 4.48. In answer to a question by Yudhisthira, Bhïsma explains the lineage of Viávàmitra and how he became a Brahman. He means to suggest that apart from his achievements, there was Brahman in his blood, he having been born by the grace of the sage Rcïka (XIII 4). Further, Viávãmitra, Bhïsma informs, founded a race of Brahmavãdins ; 62 sons of them are named - Viávãmitram câjanayad Gãdhibhãryã Yaàasvinï / Rseh prasãdãd rājendra brahmarser brahmavãdinam // Tato brãhmanatãm yâto Viávãmitro mahàtapãh // (g) XIII 18.16 f. Viávãmitra is said to have declared to the son of Pãndu that he became a Brāhmaņa by the grace of Šiva. Other sages in turn relate how they were favoured by this God, the purpose of all being to bring home to Yudhisthira the efficacy of worshipping Šiva. (h) XIII 30.2. (i) XIII 55.31 , 56.12 ff. Once in Gods' assembly, Brahmä declared that there will be Brahma- Ksatra admixture in the Kuáika race. Sage Cyavana heard this, determined to destroy the whole race before the thing could happen, and, with the privilege of his being a sage, put king Kuáika to untold hardship. He wanted to find some pretext by which he could curse him to extinction. But Kuáika's steadfastness and devotion were remarkable. So Cyavana, believing in the inevitable, came to favour him.

Svāhā first gratified her desire in the guise of Šivā the wife of Añgiras, and then, lest somebody should unduly suspect the Brāhmaņa ladies, she went out of the forest as a bird (suparņi), and on the Šveta mountain that was covered with lumps of reeds and guarded by serpents, monsters and fiends, she threw the semen which she held in her hand into a golden basin. Then assuming successively the form of five of the others, she did the same on the first lunar day (pratipat). Only the form of Arundhati she was unable to assume because of her ascetic merit and devotion to her husband. The semen thrown on the Šveta mountain produced a child, whom the Rsis called Skanda, with six heads.... Terrific prodigies were seen everywhere. Everybody accused the wives of the six sages, others accused the female eagle as being the cause thereof, but nobody suspected Svāhā. The Rsis divorced their wives with the exception of Arundhati, though Svāhā claimed the child as hers. Višvāmitra, having concluded the sacrifice of the seven rsis, had secretly followed the god of fire and knew everything as it had happened. He sought the protection of Skanda and performed for him the thirteen auspicious rites of childhood. Though Višvāmitra informed the seven rsis of the innocence of their wives yet they abandoned them unconditionally.223 Višvāmitra had a very devoted pupil in the person of Gālava.224 This pupil happened to serve him loyally even in his difficult circumstances. Finally Višvā- mitra blessed him to go, but Gālava requested the teacher to state the fee (guru- daksiņā). The teacher was content but the earnest pupil pressed his request. With a little displeasure as it were, Višvāmitra asked Gālava to present him with 800 white horses with one ear black.225 This was an impossibility. When he was feeling desperate, Suparņa came to his assistance. He offered to take him on his back anywhere he wished, so that he might collect the rare type of animal from several kings and then meet the wishes of his teacher. After much wandering, they came to king Yayâti of Pratisthāna and Suparņa made the request on behalf of Gālava. His recommendation was weighty, but Yayãti had no horses of that description. He offered, instead, his beautiful daughter Mādhāvī, setting whom as price, they could easily get the 800 horses from kings who have them. Seeing her beauty kings would even part with their kingdoms.226 At this stage when some way to success was found Suparņa took leave of Gālava. With the maiden Mādhavi then, Gālava set out and went to Haryašva king of Ayodhyâ, who was childless. 223. Mbh. Ill Chs. 224 to 226, relevant portions.

L. HARIYAPPA There he offered him the maiden for the price of 800 white horses with one ear black. The king had only two hundred and therefore proposed that he would beget only one son by her. Mãdhavi revealed to Galava that she had a boon from a sage that she would revert to virginhood after every childbrith, and that he might collect the required number from four kings if he liked. Readily the terms were accepted. Haryasva got a son Vasuprada by name. From Haryašva, they went to Divodāsa of Kāši and then to Aušinara227 of Bhojanagara. But a fourth king they could not find. Suparna came again and advised that he should take the collection hitherto made to Višvāmitra and offer Mãdhavi herself in lieu of the balance due, if that would please him. It was timely advice ; Visvāmitra was pleased and in fact asked why he did not offer her first to him ; he could have got four sons to propagate his race ! 228 It is said that Visvāmitra was pleased to beget a son (Astaka) on Mãdhavi and discharge the pupil of his obligations. The virgin was then restored to her father Yayãti, and Gālava went to penance. On account of Visvāmitra, it is reported that Indra lost his testicles which afterwards were substituted with those of a ram.229 In the thirty-sixth year after the Battle, a few sages, Visvāmitra, Kaņva and Nãrada happened to visit Dvãrakã, Krsņa's city. Seeing this, some young men of the Vrsņi clan, Sãrana and others, tried to insult them. They dressed one among themselves (Sãmba) as a woman and asked the sages what kind of child she would bear forth. Discovering their trick, the sages cursed them to destruction : that Sãmba would bring forth an iron club which will cause the destruction of the Vrsnyandhakas except Balarãma and Krsņa ; Dvãraka will be overwhelmed by the sea ; Death stalks the city, which has become demoralised, the people, giving way to drink at a festival, slay one another.230 The Pativratopãkhyãna records231 an amusing story of how a woman taught the Brāhman Kaušika that a wife's chief duty is to her husband, even before Brāhmaņas. Once a Brāhman, Kaušika by name, learned in the Vedas and the 227.

The former is evidently one belonging to the Brāhman families which were founded by Visvāmitra and belongs to a period far removed from the founder-sage and nearer the age of the Mahābhārata composition.

A crane from above dropped dirt on him. Wrathful, he looked at the bird which at once fell down dead. Sad, however, he went his way and came to the village for alms. There in a house, the lady was busy washing the utensils and therefore, asked the Brahman to stay while she would come up and offer alms. Meanwhile the husband came ; she, at once, addressed herself to attend upon him, offering the arghya, pãdya etc. This took some time, and when the lady came to give alms to the Brahman, he severely objected to her inordinate delay in honouring the Brāhman, who is an object of veneration even for Indra. And Brāhmans are like fire ; they would reduce to ashes, the entire earth ! With these words he looked at her fiercely. But the pativaratā cooly replied - Nāham bālākā viprarse tyaja krodham tapodhana / Anayâ kruddhayâ drstyã kruddhafr kim mām karisyasi / Nāvajānāmyaham viprān devais tulyän manasvinaķ / Aparādham imam vipra ksantum arhasi me'nagha / * * * Patisusrûsayâ dharmo yas sa me rocate d vi ja / Daivatesvapi sarvesu bhartā me daivatam param / 232 " I am not the crane, O sage ; give up your anger. What indeed would you do for me with your angry looks ? Brāhmans I will not disregard, for they are high- minded and equal to the gods. Do forgive this mistake, O sinless one. ...What dharma there is in attending upon the husband I like very much. Of all the gods, the husband alone is pre-eminent for me." She further adivsed Kausika to go to Dharmavyâdha (the Righteous Hunter) in Mithilā and learn from him all the dharmas. The Brāhman was much ashamed at this discomfiture, but took the lady's advice in good spirit and went to dharmavyâdha. The wisdom that he preached was as follows : (a) that it is possible to live a virtuous life even though one's profession is to sell meat, (b) that sincere repentance cleanses from sin, (c) the marks of virtuous conduct, (d) that there is justification for the killing of animals and eating their flesh, (e) concerning the law of Karma, the eternity of the soul, re-incarnation and emancipation, (/) of Brahma-vidvā - the elements, guiias, prāņas, etc. and that the relation of the soul to the senses is like that of a charioteer to his horses, (g) of the great merit of dutifulness to parents, and that character is more important than caste.233 232.

H ARI YAPP A Describing the exploits of Parašurāma to Yudhisthira, Vāsudeva (Krsna) traces his lineage234 to which Viávãmitra also belongs. Jahnu's son was Aja (Ajamidha ?) and his son was Balākāšva. Kušika was Balākāšva's son. Kušika performed austerities with the object of gaining a son like Indra. The latter preferred to take upon himself the honour of becoming Kusika's son. Thus was the famous Gādhi born. Gādhi begot a daughter called Satyavat! who was married to Rsi Rcika. This sage prepared the holy caru in order to obtain progeny. As Satyavat!' s mother also desired the favour of a son, the sage prepared the sacred food in two parts, prescribing one to his wife and the other to his mother-in-law. But this lady manoeuvred to exchange her caru with that of the daughter whereby the progeny would be born with strange attributes. The mother-in-law i.e. Gadhi's Queen who was a Ksatriya woman would bring forth a son full of Brāhmanic splendour and Satyavat!, a rsipatni, would bear a son full of martial strength and glory. On the latter pleading for mercy, it was granted that her grandson would be born with these attributes, while the son would be a Brahmavādin. Thus Višvāmitra a Ksatriya with Brāhmanic attainments became the son of Gādhi ; Jamadagni was born to Rcika, the famous Rāma Jãmadagnya (Parašurāma) was Jamadagni's son who was a Brāhman with Ksatriya instincts. Jahnu Aja Balākāšva Kušika Gādhi ! ¡ Satyavati m. Rcika Visvāmitra Jamadagni i Rāma Jãmadagnya. 234. The same subject is dealt with in a later context, the narrative being ascribed to BhTsma (XIII 4). The account is slightly elaborated, (a) The exchange of the carus and the trees (asvattha and Udumbara) which they had to clasp was due to sophistry on the part of the mother of Satyavat!. There is a slight discrepancy in the genealogy : the family is said to emanate from Bharata, the regular descent being traced from Ajamidha downwards i.e. Ajamidha - Jahnu - Sindhudvïpa - Balākāšva - Kusika - Gādhi etc. Ajamīdha is here the father of Jahnu, not son. Jahnu's son is Sindhudvïpa who is not known in the other account. Compare also the Rãmãynaa version - Rām. I 51.18-19. See supra. (6) A more flagrant departure is indicated in another context viz. Mbh. Ill 115 according to which the person who grants the caru and prescribes the trees is Bhrgu himself, the father of Rcika, this seems to be unnatural and rather unjust to the son who was also a sage of no mean attainments, one who, by Varuna's grace, produced, as dowry for the bride whom he loved to marry, a thousand white horses with one of the ears black. Tatas snusām sa bhabavàn prahrsto Bhrgur abravït / Varam vrņīsva subhage dātā hyasmi tavepsitam / Sā vai prasãdayãmãsa tam gurum putrakāraņāt / Ãtmanas caiva mātus ca prasādam ca cakāra sah / (Sts. 33-34). (c) Ķcika's son became son of Viávãmitra (Viávãmitrasya putratvam Rcïkatanayo'gamat Mbh, XII 292.13). This legend refers to âunaááepa being adopted by Viávãmitra, as. his eldest son. According to some Šunaááepa was Rcika's son ; according to others, he was the son of Ajigarta. Šunaááepa was also said to be a middle son. The anomaly arising out of this varied account has been fully discussed in the previous çhapter.</page><page sequence="183">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 305 Viávãmitra was the progenitor of a number of Brahman families. One of his sons, Astaka, seems to have continued his Ksatriya heritage. But his adoption of Sunassepa Devarâta as the eldest of all his sons is extolled as one of his glorious achievements. This has been exhaustively dealt with in the previous chapter. Like the Brahman Kausika in the Pativratopãkhyãna, we find Visvãmitra in another humiliating situation. It was a twelve-year famine, when the people had been reduced to nothingness. Famished with hunger and thirst, Visvãmitra had to forsake his wife and children and wander about for his own sustenance. At last in the outskirts of a village he found the door of a cāņdāla's hut open and saw also a quartered dog's leg (švajāghani) hanging. So taken up with hunger, Visvãmitra decided to seize the Švajāghani and eat it. Then follows a conversa- tion between the sage and the cāņdāla in which the latter appeals to the former to exercise control in the interest of Dharma, for he was not only trying to eat a forbidden thing but also taking it from a man of the low caste. Višvāmitra's conviction was only that in time of calamity there is no dharma to count ; to save one's life one may transgress the law for the moment. On coming back home, he changed his plan and decided to offer the thing first to the gods and then partake of what remains. As he was about to do this, as if that he had sufficiently tested the sage's will or as if he thought it beneath himself to eat forbidden flesh, Indra sent showers of rain immediately. The scorched earth was quenched ; the sage had not got to taste the abhaksya (anãsvãdya ca taddhavib). So when calamity befalls, the wise man, should extricate himself by all means at his command. One should at all events live ; and, alive only one attains merit and prosperity.235 Let us now turn to study Vasistha's greatness as revealed in the Mahãbhãrata. Vasistha is Brahman's mind-born son236 (Brahmano niānasaķ putraķ) and husband of Arundhati and also designated one of the prajãpatis, having a place in the court of Brahma. He is also among those who have become pure souls by virtue (dhar- meņaiva sucetasafc). 44 Kama (desire) and Krodha (anger), who cannot be van- quished even by the immortals, used to shampoo his feet. Though his wrath was excited by Visvāmitra's offence, he did not yet exterminate the Kusikas. Afflicted 235. Mbh.

E. P. Rice thinks that Visvãmitra 44 ate cāņdāla food and justified the act." This is however contrary to the text. (Rice's Index, p. 54). A famine in which great sages like Visvãmitra are prostrate should indeed be terrible. The Rgveda records the instance of Vāmadeva (Seer of the Sixth Maņdala) who, in similar plight, cooked the entrails of a dog - (Šūna āntrāņi pece). But Viávãmitra lived on mere air for a thousand years and never breathed at all for a thousand years more ! Which of the reports could be true is a thing to wonder. 236, Cf. Mbh. 1 174.5, II 11.18-19, III 31.12, VII 6.6, XII 166.15-16, 208.32, 334.36,340,69.</page><page sequence="184">306 H- L- HARIYAPPA at the loss of his sons, he did not do any dreadful deed for the destruction of Višvā- mitra. He did not transgress Krtānta (Death) in order to bring back his lost children from the abode of Yama. It was by obtaining him that the Iks vākus acquired this earth and with him as their purohita, they performed many great sacrifices."237 Vasistha distinguished himself as purohita of other kings also. To king Samvaraņa he did a favour by prevailing upon Surya to give his daughter Tapat! in marriage.238 As purohita to Mucukunda, who conquered the earth and ruled by might only, he did penance and killed all the demon hosts let loose by Kubera.239 At another time he was pleased with Rantideva and when there was terrible draught in the country, he sustained the people like the very lord of Creatures.240 With the co-operation of sage Vāmadeva, he accompanied Bharata to the forest to bring Rāma back and later, anointed Rāma Dāsarathi on the throne241and also worshipped Krsņa while he was on his mission to Duryodhana,242 performed a sacrifice for Kuru in Kuruksetra on the River Saras vati. 243 Vasistha is further reputed to be the propagator of one of four original go tras. 244 He caused the Sarayu river to flow on earth.245 Sage Parāsara was his grandson246 and the great Vyäsa was the son of Parāsara.247 In heaven Vasistha did yeoman service to Indra, fighting with the demon Vrtra ; Indra became unconscious once ; at that time did Vasistha revive him with the Rathantara-Sãma.248 Apart from his being Brahma's mind-born son, Vasistha is said to have arisen from the seed of the gods which Krsņa caused to fall into a jar ; so Bhisma explains while expatiating on the greatness of Šrī Krsņa.249 The birth of the sage took place in the Eastern direction, there he became famous and there did he depart 237.

When the guest (Indra disguised as Vasistha) arrived, she welcomed him according to the rules laid down and humbly offered any service except her hand which was to clasp Indra's only.253 The revered guest then gave five jujube fruits (badara), asking her to prepare a meal out of them and went away. When she set herself to the task, they would not bake at all. The fuel was exhausted, but she put her legs into the hearth as fuel, without a tremor and without a sigh. The God was pleased and took her to heaven. That holy spot is called Badarapācana.254 Vasistha and Arundhatī are objects of adoration and example to society. Kunti blesses Draupadī that she may be to her husbands as Arundhati to Vasistha, as Bhadrā to Vaišravaņa and as Laksmi to Nãrãyana etc.255 Šāntā, daughter of Lomapāda, attended upon Rsyašrňga as devotedly as Arundhatī upon Vasistha,256 as Lopāmudrā upon Agastya etc. When the world is beset with calamity the revered dame Arundhati supersedes Vasistha ! 257 But Arundhati's virtue is un- impeachable as is evidenced by the story of Agni's love for the wives of the Seven Sages. Svāhā, in winning the love of Agni, could not impersonate Arundhati, because of her spotless character as a pativratā, while she successfully impersonated the other six and bore the great War-god, Kumāra.258 Finally Bhisma relates how Arundhati preached righteousness (dharma) to the Sages, the manes and the gods,259 concentrating upon the efficacy of gifts and of the worship of the cow.

On several occasions Vasistha himself is engaged in philosophic discussions with Brahma on the one side260 and with Karālajanaka on the other ; taught higher knowledge to Nārada.261 Hiranyaksipu was cursed by Vasistha son of Hiranyagabha because he elected a different Hotr priest, whereby he even before the sacrifice ended, met his own end at the hands of a verv strange being.262 Having thus surveyed the individual life story of Vasistha and Visvāmitra as depicted in the Mahābhārata, we may now examine the story of their age-long hostility. The Mbh. tradition, of course, takes the rivalry or even hatred between the sages as an established fact. But as they have been counted within the group of the most eminent sages, the Saptarsis, it is also undeniable that the question of their hatred had long before been shelved. It no doubt endured in popular tradition only to do credit to both sages, the one as an embodiment of saintly excellence, the other an embodiment of the highest realisation through action (purusakāra). The one was born divine and the other, by tapas, attained divinity. We may now recapitulate their mutual hostility as related in the Mbh. The Gandharva relates the story to Arjuna.263 This old story (purāņa) of Vasistha they tell in all worlds. In Kãnyakubja, king Gādhi, son of Kusika, had a son Visvāmitra, who, with his ministers used to go a-hunting. Once he arrived at the hermitage of Vasistha, who offered him arghya etc. from his cow Nandini, who yielded everything desired ; Visvāmitra asked Vasistha to give him Nandini for an arbuda of kine or his kingdom but in vain. Then he wanted to take the cow by force. She repaired to Vasistha, who at first did nothing saying264 " I am a forgiving brāhman," but at last he said, " I do not abandon you ! Stay if you can !265 Hearing this word, the cow attacked Višvāmitra's troops. From her tail she began to rain showers of burning coals, from her tail she brought forth Pahlavas, from her udders Drāvidas and Sakas, from her vitals Yavanas, from her dung Sabaras, from her urine and from her sides several other Šabaras, and from the froth of her mouth Paundras, Kirātas, Yavanas, Simhalas, Barbaras, Khasas, Cibukas, Pulindas, Cīņas, Hūņas, Keralas and other Mlecchas, who attack- ed Višvāmitra's soldiers.

Visvämitra was an accomplice268 in this dastardly act inasmuch as he directed a fiend called Kinkara to possess king Kalmāsapāda. That gave him the required monstrosity to eat human beings. Vasistha was filled with sorrow at this bereavement ; but he patiently bore his grief and resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate the Kusikas. Hb threw himself down from the summit of Meru, entered a huge fire in the forest, and tied a heavy weight to his neck and threw himself into the sea, but all in vain, and, in distress of heart, he returned to his hermitage. Beholding it bereft of his children, he left it again and tied himself strongly with cords and flung himself into a mighty river, but the stream cut those cords and cast the rsi ashore whence that river was called Vipāšā. Once more he threw himself into a river flowing from Himavat (Haimavati) but the river immediately fled in 100 different directions and has since been known by the name of Šatadru.269 He now again went towards his hermitage,270 and was, on the way, addressed by Adrsyanti, the wife of Šakti, who had for twelve years borne his child in her womb. Hearing that child in the womb reciting the Vedas with the six angas, Vasistha refrained from self-destruction271 and, accompanied by Adrsyanti returned to his hermitage. One day he saw Kalmāsapāda, who would devour him. Adrsyanti was terrified, but Vasistha restrained him by uttering " hum," and, sprinkling him with water sanctified by mantras, freed him from his curse that had lasted twelve years. Kalmāsapāda promised never more to insult Brāhmans and prevailed upon Vasistha that he accompanied him to his capital Ayodhyä and begot a son for him on the queen. Then he went back to his hermitage. After twleve years the queen tore open her womb by a stone, and then was born the Rājarsi Ašmaka, who founded the city of Paudanya.272 Arjuna asked : why did Kalmāsapāda command his queen to go to Vasistha ? And was this an act of sin on Vasistha's part ? The Gandharva replied :273 Under the influence of the curse, Kalmāsapāda, in anger, went out of his capital, ac- companied by his wife. In a solitary part of the woods he saw a Brāhm&amp;n and his wife embracing each other. The couple ran away, but Kalmāsapāda forcibly 267. The Vedic version is that Šakti was thrown into fire by the Saudâsas.

The tears that the woman shed blazed up like fire and consumed everything in that place. The Brahmani cursed the rājarsi saying that he should meet with instant death when cohabiting with his wife and that his wife should have a son from Vasistha whose children he had devoured, and that child should be the propagator of his race. Then she entered the fire. Vasistha by his ascetic power immediately knew all about it. And long after this, when the Rājarsi became freed from his curse, he approached his wife Madayanti, not remem- bering the curse of the Brahmani. Hearing, however, the words of his wife, he recollected the curse and therefore, he appointed Vasistha to beget a son on his queen. Višvāmitra's first encounter with Vasistha is somewhat differently related in another context. While describing Balarāma's pilgrimage in Šalya-parva, Vaisampãyana relates to Janamejaya the story of how certain kings attained Brāhmanhood, and among them Višvāmitra.274 The great Ksatriya Gādhi Kaušika became an ascetic, having resolved to give up his body, he installed his son Višvā- mitra on the throne, notwithstanding the solicitations of his subjects, and went to heaven. Višvāmitra however could not protect the earth even with his best exertions.275 He then heard of a great fear of the Rāksasas, and went out with his army. In the hermitage of Vasistha, his troops caused much mischief ; when Vasistha came to the hermitage he became angry and commanded his cow to create many terrible Sabaras, who, encountering the army of Višvāmitra caused great carnage and the troops fled away. Višvāmitra then set his heart on ascetic austerities, and in the tirtha of the Sarasvati, he began to emaciate his own body,276 although the gods repeatedly attempted to interrupt him. Brahmā granted him the boon that he should become a brāhman. Then he wandered over the whole earth like a celestial.277 Višvāmitra's hatred of Vasistha appears to have been of an uncompromising and unrelenting kind as the former wished to kill the latter by any means.278 The hermitage of Vasistha was in Sthāņutirtha on the bank of the Sarasvati ; on the opposite bank was the hermitage of Višvāmitra. There Sthāņu had practised penances, and having performed a sacrifice and worshipped the Sarasvati, he had established a tirtha and there the gods of yore installed Skanda. Višvāmitra and Vasistha everyday challenged each other in respect of the superiority of their penances. Višvāmitra ordered the Sarasvati, notwithstanding her trembling, to bring Vasistha into his presence, that he might slay him. Vasistha willingly let 274. 1X40.11-29. 275.

Sartasvat! washed away one of her banks and bore Vasistha away and informed Visvāmitra about his arrival; but while the latter was looking for a weapon she quickly washed Vasistha back to the Eastern bank. Visvāmitra cursed her, saying that her current should be changed into blood which is acceptable only to the Rāksasas. For a whole year she then flowed bearing blood mixed with water. The gods, the Gandharvas, and the Apsarasas grieved. For this reason the tlrtha came to be Vasisthāpavāha. Sarasvati, however, once more got back her own proper condition when some sages on a pilgrimage to the holy river, having bathed in all her tlrthas, came to Vasisthāpavāha, and saw the water mixed with blood, innumerable Rāksasas drinking it. Having learnt the cause, they worshipped Mahādeva with penances and purified the Sarasvati.279 The Rāksasas, who were Brahma-Rāksasas (so those among Vaisyas, Šūdras and Ksatriyas who hate and injure the brāhmans, become Rāksasas), afflicted with hunger, sought the protection of the sages who, having ordained what should be the food of the Rāksasas, solicited the Sarasvati, who assumed a new shape called Aruņā (Red River) ; bathing in that new river, the Rāksasas abandoned their bodies and went to heaven. Ascertaining all this, Indra bathed there and became purified of a grievous sin (Brahmahatyâ).280 Before taking a retrospect of the history of the two sages and their mutual realtionship, we may take note of a partial summary of Višvāmitra's deeds, given in connection with the Sakuntalopâkhyâna. Sakuntalā relates her parentage to Dusyanta as once given out by sage Kanva to another sage who came as a guest. Visvāmitra deprived Vasistha of his children. Though born as a Ksatriya he became a brahman through his penances, and created the river Kaušikī for his ablutions. There his wife, during a famine, was maintained by the rājarsi Matañga who was living as a hunter. Therefore when the famine was over, Visvāmitra changed the name of the river into Pārā and performed a sacrifice for Matañga and Indra himself, from fear, came there to drink soma. Visvāmitra in anger, created another world and a series of naksatras, beginning with Pratišravaņa and gave protection to Trisañku, who was cursed by his preceptor. He could burn the three worlds by his splendour, and by a kick cause the earth to shake. He could sever Meru and hurl it away at any distance. He could round the Earth, in a moment and Yama, Soma, the Maharsis, the Sädhyas, the Visvas and the Vālakhilvas are afraid of his prowess.281 279.

The confusion in the sequence of events in this narrative is undoubted, Apsaras Menakā is pleading before Indra as to how, forsooth, could she tackle a sage of such prowess and anger. Elsewhere (in the Rām. for instance) it is represented that the Menakā episode was a stage in the sage's elevation to Bràhmanhood ; possibly so, because the Bramharsi is free from excitement, anger and passion : and Menakā provided a test. Secondly, are Matañga and Trisañku different or identical ? The tenor of this passage points to their being different</page><page sequence="190">312 H. L. HARIYAPPA From the numerous references to Vasistha and Višvāmitra in the Great Epics, Rãmãyana and the Mahābhārata, it is reasonable to deduce as follows : (а) Vasistha and Višvāmitra had a long life of activity before they were elevated to be among the chosen Seven i.e. the Saptarsis. (б) Vasistha was born great, all saintliness and virtue were natural to him, he was the embodiment of patience, of the quality of Sattva. His passive resistance when attacked by the enemy appears exemplary. His attempt at self-immolation in his bereavement is somewhat strange and savours of being too commonplace. His eminence, however, as saint and priest of kings (purohita) is undoubted. (c) Višvāmitra achieved greatness. Son of a king, he perfected himself in the qualities and attainments of a rãjanya ; an embodiment of the quality of Bajas, he was. But seeing that the quality of Sattva had more enduring features, determined to acquire it. The chief thing was to conquer passion and anger ; this he did achieve by penance, by patient but steadfast endeavour (purusakāra). (d) The Vasistha- Višvāmitra feud reveals itself as a thing of the ancient past even in the age of the Mbh. Tradition, at any rate, believed that the two sages were once upon a time enemies of each other. The events connected there- with were remembered not because it was a quarrel between two great personalities but because it would serve as a becaon light of righteousness on the one hand and effective human endeavour on the other. (e) Popular tradition betrays no partility to either of them, one, for instance, of the nature suggested by the expression 44 Vasistha-dvesinyab," which is applied to a few verses in the Višvāmitra-maņdala, said to be imprecations against the Vasisthas ; whereas no imprecation in the Vasistha-maņdala is ever regarded as despising the Višvāmitras. The Mbh. age conceives the sages as equally respect- able ; there was no question of their relative superiority. On the other hand, a word should be said to the credit of the self-made saint Višvāmitra, who, by dint of his achievement, had inspired the people with a reverential awe. The world was amazed at his powers of making or unmaking it. It was not much wonder that he could as well be one of the four founders of Brāhman tribes as it were and hence an inspirer of a tradition by itself ; a veritable sampradâya-pravartaka. HARIVAMŠA One incident connected with Vasistha and Višvāmitra is pointedly dealt with in the Harivamša, that is about Satya vrata. 282 He was the son of king Trayyäruna persons, though they are possibly identical with one another, as is stated in another context. ( Vide VP Wilson vol. Ill pp. 284 ff. as referred to in his MOST I. p. 375 f. See VP text IV 3.13, compare also Hari. 12 and 13, where Vasistha is also introduced). The anomalies in the narrative of Viávamitra's deeds, as shown above, may be of no serious consequence when we remember that the narrator was Šakuntalā, who in her unsophisticated innocence recalled the events of a bygone age just as they occurred to her mind. They have no chronological value. 282. Hari. chs. 12 and 13.</page><page sequence="191">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 3X8 who had Vasistha for his priest. Once Satyavrata carried away a bride who had been betrothed to another. King Trayyáruna abandoned the son on this account whereupon the latter lived among the low caste people in a degraded condition. The old king went to the forest, for penance. Vasistha himself managed the affairs of State. A twelve year draught then set in as result of adharma for which Satyavrata was responsible. The latter, however, nourished a sense of anger against Vasistsha because he did not exert his influence to dissuade the king from the drastic punishment which was inflicted on the Prince. At this time, Viávâmitra had left his family and children there and gone to the shores of the ocean for penance. 'When the famine set in, the family was reduced to severe straits. Višvāmitra's wife was about to sell away her middle son (Gálava) for a hundred cows in order to sustain the rest. Meanwhile Satyavrata intervened and liberated the boy, and, until Višvāmitra returned from penance, provided them with venison and pork which he (every day) tied to a tree near their residence. To Visastha, how- ever, he never reconciled himself ; and once when he could not procure food anywhere, he happened to see Vasistha's all-bestowing cow which he at once killed and fed himself and Višvāmitra's family. Vasistha got angry and denounced the offender as Trišaňku, one who has committed three sins, viz . causing displeasure to the father, killing the preceptor's cow and eating unsprinkled food.283 Now Višvāmitra returned from austerities and was much pleased with Satyavrata for the support he gave for his family in his absence. Asked to elect a favour in return, the outcast Prince prayed that he might be enabled to ascend Heaven bodily. The famine having abated, Visvāmitra reinstated him on the throne and sacrificed for him so that, as all gods and even Vasistha could see, sent Trišaňku bodily to Heaven. The famous Harišcandra was the son of this King Satyavarta Trišaňku.284 Višvāmitra's lineage, the adoption of Šunaššepa Devarāta into his family with all rights of primogeniture, and the ever-baffling host of sons and families that emanated from him have been accounted in the Harivamsa.285 These have been fully discussed in the foregoing chapters in various contexts. So far as genealogies go, the accounts in the Hari. add to the confusion. Šunassepa is the middle son with Jamadagni for his elder brother and Šunabpuccha for the younger !286 Višvāmitra's original name was Višvaratha,287 not the only son of Gādhi, he had brothers as well, Višvakrt, and Višvajit, and a sister Satyavati, 283. aproksitopayogãt asamskrtamāmsabhaksaņāt Ib.

HARIYAPPA youngest of them all.288 One is tempted to think that all the three names Višvaratha, Višvakrt and Visvajit are only epithets289 of Višvāmitra who possessed all the qualities connoted by those names : the course of his chariot extended over all the three worlds ; he was world-maker (anyam Indram karisyãmi etc.) and world-conqueror. VII PURĀNAS Vasistha and Višvāmitra are familiar personalities in the entire range of Purāņic literature. Both sages were revered. Vasistha was regarded as one of the mind-born sons of Brahmā.290 He and Višvāmitra are both counted among the seven holy sages (Saptarsis) of the Vaivasvata-manvantara.291 Between them, they have rendered so many places on the banks of the Sarasvati and Ganga holy on account of one or other of their great achievements. Quite new incidents have been recorded about them, as we shall see presently. Their rivalry or hostility is a thing of the past, not endangering the reputation of either^ of course. Never- theless the several incidents which mark their mutual jealousy and hatred are narrated with ever-changing colours. While Vasistha was described as a mind-born son of the Creator, we see a second birth become necessary for him on account of the curse of Nimi ! The story is thus told in the Visņu-Purāņa : The son of Iksvāku, who was named Nimi, instituted a sacrifice that was to endure for a thousand years, and applied to Vasistha to offer the oblations. Vasistha in answer said that he had been 288. Višvāmitras tu Gädheyo rājā Visvarathas tadā / Visvakrd Visvajiccaiva tathā Satyavatî nrpa / Ib. XXXII 51-3. - Satyavatî Višvāmitrādīnām Kanîyasî (com.) 289. Pargiter thinks that Visvaratha was his original name. That is how it looks from XXVII 44. But seeing that coupled with two more names in XXXII 51-52, it is better to conceive all as epithets. The name Višvāmitra itself appears to be an acquired name. His real name appears to be unknown. 290. See, for instance, Brahma I 43.4, Visņu I 7.5, Brahmāņda II 11, Matsya 3.6-7, Bhāgavata III 12.22-24, Vā_yu 25.82, etc. The number of these mānasa-putras ranges from 7 to 10. Vasistha married Ūrjjā (Energy), one of the 24 daughters of Patriarch Daksa, and had seven sons by her, namely, Rajas, Gātra, Ūrdhvabāhu, Savana, Anagha, Sutapas and Šukra. (Visņu I 10.13 f). The famous Šakti and other sons are from a different marriage evidently - Aksamālā or Arundhatī. 291. The Seven Sages are supposed to be different in each Manvantara. For instance in the third i.e. Auttami Manvantara. (Vide Visņu III 1.15) the seven sons of Vasistha were the seven Rsis. Strange, however, that the father is one of the seven sages only in a later i.e. the seventh Manvantara (Vaivasvata). It must be a descendant of the progenitor of the Vasistha family. Incidentally, it may be noted, that the entire cosmogony changes from Manvantara to Manvantara. Different is Indra, different are the classes of gods, the divine sages etc. This fanciful picture is ably satirised by Nīlakaņtha Dīksita in his Campū, the Nïlakantha-Vijaya. In the outer chamber of Brahma's Palace, a number of Potentates are waiting for an interview with the Highest one. Indra went up to the door, the Lord-in- Waiting asks : 44 Indra of what Age are you ? " (Katamah Purandarah) ! The accounts in the Purāņas and the Upapurāņas pertaining to the creation aTe by no means consistent. They baffle all attempts at a clear delinea- tion. One may however benefit from a perusal of the notes provided by H. H. Wilson in his translation of the Visņu Purāņa Books I to III.</page><page sequence="193">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 3j5 pre engaged by Indra for five hundred years, but if the king would wait for some time, he would come and officiate as superintending priest. The king made no answer, and Vasistha went away supposing that he had assented. When the sage had completed the performance of the ceremonies he had conducted for Indra, he returned with all speed to Nimi, purposing to render him the like office. When he arrived, however, and found that Nimi had retained Gautama and other priests to minister at his sacrifice, he was much displeased and pronounced upon the king, who was then asleep, a curse to the effect that since he had not intimated his inten- tion, but transferred to Gautama the duty he had first entrusted to himself, Vasistha . Nimi should thenceforth cease to exist in corporeal form. When Nimi woke up and knew what had' happened, he in return denounced as an imprecation upon his unjust preceptor, that he also should lose his bodily existence as punishment for uttering a curse upon him before communicating with him. Nimi then abandoned his bodily condition. The spirit of Vaistha also leaving his body was united with the spirits of Mitra and Varuna for a season until, through their passion for the celestial nymph Urvašī the sage was reborn. The corpse of Nimi was preserved from decay by being embalmed with fragrant oils and resins. When the sacrifice was concluded, the gods who had come to receive their portions were willing to restore him to bodily life, but Nimi declined to resume a corporeal shape. He wished, however, to dwell in the eyes of all beings. To this desire, the gods assented and Nimi was placed by them in the eyes of all living creatures, in consequence of which their eyelids are ever opening and closing.292 Vasistha was responsible for the banishment of Vikuksi by his father Iksvāku. Upon one of the days called Astakā, Iksvāku being desirous of celebrating ancestral obsequies, ordered Vikuksi, to bring him flesh suitable for the offering. The prince accordingly went into the forest and killed many deer, and other wild animals for the ceremony. Being weary with the chase and being hungry, he sat down and ate a hare ; after which, being refreshed, he carried the rest of the game to his father. Vasistha the family priest of the House of Iksvāku was summoned to consecratc the food, but he declared that it was impure, in consequence of Vikuksi having eaten a hare from amongst it (making it thus, as it were, the remnant of his meal). Vikuksi was in consequence abandoned by his offended father and the epithet Sašāda (hare- eater) was given to him being so described by the preceptor.293 Turning to Visvāmitra, we find that his descent is traced to Jahnu, who in turn was descended from Amāvasu son of Aila. Visvāmitra is the son of Gādhi and grandson of Kusika according to Brahma-purāņa, of Kusāmba according to 292. Visiiu IV 1-9 (sections in prose style). Vide also : Matsya 61.32-6, 201.1-17, Padma V 22.34.-37, Vāyu 89.4 ; Brahmāņda III 64.4, Bhāgavata IX 13.1-6, Rām. VII 55.56,57. Accord- ing to Pargiter, there were two kings of the name, one of Videha and another of Vidarbha ; Nimi is also a rsi belonging to the Átreyas. Nimi of the episode in question must be of Videha (Vi-deha = bodiless) as the name itself suggests. (AIHT: consult the Index). Slight variations may be perceived in the different Purāņas cited above, cf. AIHT p. 215. 293. Visņu IV 2.5-7, c/. also Vayu 88.11-19, Brahma 7.48-51, Brahmāņda III 63.11-20.

HARIYAPPA Visņu-Purāņa.294 These are minor differences ; one thing is certain, Višvāmitra, at all events, was born in a line of kings but became a Brahmarsi by resolve. His association with the Šunaššepa legend, as told in the Purāņas, has been fully discussed in the previous chapter. The incident of having to eat dog's flesh for want of better food during a twelve-year famine was the occasion for a discourse between Višvāmitra and a Cándala from whose house, the sage was about to make away with "dog's leg" (šva-jāghani), on the right or wrong of such an action. Ultimately Indra opened his eyes and showered rain to end the famine. The Brahma purāņa describes this story more picturesquely.295 Once there occurred a terrible' draught, there was nowhere food available. Višvāmitra repaired to the holy river Gautami. Seeing his wife, children and disciples emaciated with hunger, the sage ordered the pupils to hunt up something to eat without delay. They roamed about and brought a dead dog which was all they could find. Višvāmitra said : 44 Very well, cut it up, wash and roast it ; we shall, according to rule, propitiate the gods, sages, and the manes and then partake of the ramainder." The pupils obeyed. Agni came, the gods' messenger, was astonished to see the offering and told the gods that they have to eat dog's flesh which the sage in distress has offered. To prevent such a base offering, Indra came as an eagle and carried away the vessel which contained the flesh. The sage was wrath when the pupils reported this and was about to curse when Indra transformed the contents into honey and replaced the vessel. But Višvāmitra demanded the dog's flesh itself on pain of being reduced to ashes. Afraid of consequences, Indra came up and said, 44 why bother about the inedible dog's flesh, pour the honey-oblation and drink the rest in the company of your children." Višvāmirra replied, 4 what use with one such meal ? All people are suffering, then what is the good of this honey ? If it should become nectar for all, then only I would have it pure, otherwise, gods and manes shall eat this flesh of the dog. And then I shall also eat it, to be sure."296 Realising the danger, Indra immediately summoned the clouds and showered nectar-like rain on earth. There was joy everywhere. Thenceforth that place on the Gautami became famous as Višvāmitra-tirtha. 294. Brahma 10.11-68, Visņu IV 7.1-16, Váyu 91.49-103, reads Kuáãávafor Kuéika, Brah- māņda III 66.23-69. 295.

There is no doubt that the outline of the story given in the Mbh. is here expanded and embellished so as to make it attractive to those for whom the literature was meant. That these sages with all their divine powers had to suffer earthly ills as hunger and thirst is hard to reconcile.</page><page sequence="195">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 317 Now remain the legend of Kalmāsapāda and that of Satyavrata Trisañku, both of which remind the world of the ancient feud between Vasistha and Visvā- mitra. The Visņu-purāņa narrates the first story as follows : Mitrasaha, son of Sudāsa of Ayodhyâ once celebrated a sacrifice which was conducted by Vasistha. At the close of the rite, Vasistha went out. At that time a Rāksasa assumed the semblance of Vasistha and came and said to the king : " 1 Now that the sacrifice is ended, you must give me flesh to eat ; let it be cooked and I, will presently return." Having said this, he withdrew, and, transforming himself into the shape of the cook, dressed some human flesh, which he brought to the king, who, receiving it on a plate of gold, awaited the reappearance of Vasistha. As soon as the sage returned, the king offered him the dish. Vasistha, surprised at such want of propriety in the king, as his offering him meat to eat, considered what it should be that was so presented and by the efficacy of his meditations discovered that it was human flesh. He grew angry and denounced a curse upon the king saying : " Inasmuch as vou have insulted all such holy men as we are, by giving me what is not to be eaten, your appetite shall henceforth be excited by similar food. 44 It was yourself," replied the king to the indignant sage, 44 who commanded this food to be prepared." 44 By me !" exclaimed Vasistha, 44 how could that have been?" and, again, having recourse to meditation, he detected the whole truth. Foregoing then all displeasure towards the king, he said : 44 The food to which I have sentenced you shall not be your sustenance for ever, it shall only be so for twelve years." The king who had taken up water in the palm of his hand and was prepared to curse the sage, now considered that Vasistha was his spiritual guide, and being reminded by Madayantï his queen that it ill beca me him to denou- nce an imprecation upon a holy teacher, who was the guardian divinity of his race, abandoned his intention. Unwilling to cast the water upon the earth, lest it should wither up the grain, for it was impregnated with his malediction, and equal- ly reluctant to throw it up into the air lest it should blast the clouds and dry up their contents, he threw it down upon his own feet. Scalded by the heat which the water had derived from his angry imprecation, the feet of the king became spotted black and white, and he thence obtained the name of Kalmāsapāda or he with the spotted feet. In consequence of the curse of Vasistha, the king became a cannibal every sixth watch of the day for twelve years, and in that state wandered through the forests, and devoured multitudes of men. One occasion, he beheld a holy person engaged in sport with his wife. As soon as they saw his terrific form, they were frightened and endeavoured to escape. But the royal cannibal overtook and seized the husband. The wife then also desisted from flight, and earnestly entreat- ed the savage to spare her lord exclaiming, 44 Thou, Mitrasaha, art the pride of the royal House of Iksvāku, not a malignant fiend ! It is not in thy nature, who knowest the characters of women, to carry off and devour my husband." But all was in vain, and, regardless of her repeated supplications, he ate the Brahman, as a tiger devours the deer. Furious with wrath, the Brāhman's wife addressed the king</page><page sequence="196">318 H. L. HARIYAPPA and said, " Since you have barbarously disturbed the joys of a wedded pair and killed my husband, your death shall be the consequence of your associating with your queen." So saying, she entered the flames. At the expiration of the period of his curse, Saudāsa returned home. Being reminded of the curse of the Brahmani by his wife Madayanti, he abstained from conjugal intercourse and was therefore childless. But having solicited the inter- position of Vasistha, Madayanti became pregnant. The child however was not born for seven years, when the queen, becoming impatient, divided the womb with a sharp stone and was thereby delivered. The child was thence called Ašmaka.297 The above account is corroborated by the Bhāgavata.298 As it is, it shows no interference on the part of Višvāmitra in the affair of Vasistha and Kalmāsapāda. The Mbh. supplies the link viz. that the Rāksasa, who played the mischief by impersonating Vasistha for the moment, was employed by Višvāmitra.299 This was specially so when, according to Mbh., the king was cursed by Šakti son of Vasistha. Nevertheless, some disagreements among the several authorities must be acknowledged with regard to this story. According to the Brhaddevatā, at a great sacrifice by Sudās, Višvāmitra was overcome by Šakti. Consequently Višvāmitra sank down unconscious. But to him the Jamadagnis gave speech called Sasarparï, having brought her from the dwelling of the Sun. That speech dispelled the Kušikas' loss of intelligence (a-matim).300 The Sarvānukramaņi, introducing RV VII 32, says that Šakti, thrown to the fire by the Saudāsas, com- posed the last pragāthā, but before he finished, he was consumed ; Vasistha com- pleted it.301 The Brhaddevatā, again, points out that Vasistha's hundred sons were killed by the Saudāsas or by Sudāsa who in consequence of a curse had been transformed into a Raksas.302 Now it is this story that is found elaborated in the Mbh. The other two stories are not traced in the Purāņas.303 The Mahābhārata relates the conflict304 between Šakti and Kalmāsapāda for precedence of giving way in the road,305 the king beat him with a whip whereupon Šakti cursed him to become a cannibal. At this stage it is reported that Višvāmitra 297. Visņu IV 4.19-38. 298. Bhàgavata IX 9.18-39. Vide also Rám. VII 65 and Brhannâradïya IX 3-151. 299. Mbh. I 176. see infra. 300. BD IV 112-114.

He again cursed him. The cannibal in him was now roused and poor Šakti became the first victim ; and later on his younger brothers also were devoured. Vasistha bore the grief when he learnt that Sakti's wife Adrsyanti was pregnant, so that there would be progeny to continue the line. It so happened that, as he returned to his abode with the daughter-in-law, they happened to encounter the cannibal king. Adrsyanti got terrified, but Vasistha put down the demon by a hunkāra, which ended the curse actually and restored the distressed king to normal life and thinking. Coming back to his old self, Kalmāsapāda paid due homage to Vasistha and, later on, requested him to beget a son on his queen MadayantI, which extraordinary proce- dure became necessary on account of a Brāhmaņi's curse during his cursed life when he deprived her of her joy with the husband by devouring him. Thus we see that the Raksas who was set upon the depraved king was responsible for all the misery of Vasistha and the death of his sons. Among the stories that centre round Visvāmitra, that of Satyavrata Trisañku has somewhat pre-eminently caught the Purāņic fancy.307 Trayyäruna was a king of the Iksvāku race. His son was Satyarvata who got the appellation of Trisañku and was degraded to the condition of cāņdāla, or outcast. According to Vāyu-purāņa he was banished by his father for his wickedness (adharma). The Brahma and Harivamsa detail his inequity at length. He carried off the betrothed wife of a citizen, as the wedding ceremony was in progress. He was therefore banished by the father and directed to live among the svapākas (dog-eaters). Vasistha did not intercede. Then there came a terrible famine in which Indra did not shower rain for twelve years. Visvāmitra had left his wife and children in that country and gone to the shores of the sea for penance. In this situation, Satyavrata provided the flesh of deer for the sustenance of the family, suspending it upon a spreading fig-tree on the borders of the Ganges, that he might not subject them to the indignity of receiving at the hands of an outcast. Visvāmitra's wife was even prepared to sell her middle son for a hundred cows, tying a collar round the neck, perhaps to proclaim him for sale (gale baddhvā). Satyavrata interceded and got him liberated ; the boy came to be known as Gālava. Thus did Satyavarta spend the twelve years, proving all the while helpful to Visvāmitra's family but bearing unrelenting hatred against Vasistha as the latter did not sympathise with him. Once while he had to hunt up food, and when game failed, he killed the cow of Vasistha. Whereupon, the preceptor denounced him as Trisañku, 44 one who has committed three sins," viz. displeasing the father, killing a cow and eating 306. Just when the offending king was about to apologise, Visvāmitra directed the fiend to possess him, and by his supernatural powers incited both the parties to excesses. The prime cause for all this was the hostility between Vasistha and Visvāmitra. The latter had asked the king to perform a sacrifice with him as priest, whereas Vasistha was the family priest. The king naturally preferred him. So Visvāmitra was bent upon harassing both. Ibid. 176.4 and 15-22. 307.

Returning from penance, Višvāmitra was very much pleased with Trišanku's friendly services and pressed him to choose a boon. Satyavrata wished to be bodily elevated to Heaven. Visvāmitra installed him on the throne and as all, including Vasistha, could see, celebrated a sacrifice and sent him bodily to heaven. It was seen in the foregoing pages how, according to the Rãmãyana, Visvāmitra was prepared to contend not only with one individual Vasistha, but with the whole host of the gods. When he was out to sacrifice for an outcast, the gods naturally did not heed for he was acting against Rta, establish- ed path. But he was determined to please them or have his own way by creating, by means of his supernatural powers, a different Indra and a different firmament with full stellar and planetary complement. The gods had but to acknowledge the force of his determination and compromise with him, with the result that Trišanku was left suspended in mid-air, forming a constellation in the southern hemisphere along with other new planets and stars created by Visvāmitra. The Bhāgavata says admiringly that Trišanku is still visible in the sky (aydâpi divi drsyate). The Vâyu furnishes some further information. 44 Men acquainted with the Puráiias recite these two stanzas : 4 By the favour of Visvāmitra, the illustrious Trišanku shines in heaven along with the gods, through the kindness of that sage. Slowly passes the lovely night in winter, embellished by the moon, decorated with three watches and ornamented with the constellation Trišanku."308 Trišanku is identified with the Orion, the three bright stars of his belt being the three šankus, (stakes or pins) which form his name. The Vasistha-Višvāmitra feud reaches its climax in the story of Harišcandra, son of Satyavrata Trišanku. According to the Šunaššepa legend related in the AB and other works, Vasistha and Višvāmitra were high priests co-operating with the sacrifice performed by Harišcandra. It might then be a subsequent event in the life of that king, if not fabricated by the fertile imagination of the story-teller. The Mãrkandeya-purâna309 expands the story at considerable length. One dav 308.

Hariscandra, as the defender of the distressed, went to the rescue, but Višvāmitra was so provoked by his interference that the Sciences instantly perished and Hariscandra was reduced to a state of abject helplessness. Višvāmitra demanded the sacrificial gift due to him as a Brahman and the king offered him whatever he might choose to ask, 4 gold, his own son, wife, body, life, kingdom, good fortune,' whatever was dearest. Višvāmitra stripped him of his wealth and kingdom, leaving him nothing but a garment of bark and his wife and son. In a state of destitution, he left his kingdom and Višvāmitra struck Saibyä, the queen, with his staff to hasten her reluctant departure. To escape from his oppressor he proceeded to the holy city of Benares, but the relentless sage was waiting for him and demanded the completion of his gift. With bitter grief, wife and child were sold, and there remained only himself. Dharma, the god of justice, appeared in the from of a hideous and offensive Cāņdāla and offered to buy him. Notwithstanding the exile's repugnance and horror, Višvāmitra insisted upon the sale, and Harišcandra was carried off 44 bound, beaten, confused and afflicted," to the abode of the cāņdāla. He was then employed at the grave-yard to collect clothes etc. from the dead bodies. In this horrid place and degrading work he spent twelve months. His wife then came to the cemetery to perform the obsequies of her son, who had died of serpent bite. They recognised each other and resolved to die upon the funeral pyre of their son, though Hariš- candra hesitated to take away his own life without the consent of the master. After all was prepared, he gave himself up to meditation on Visņu. The gods then arrived, headed by Dharma and accompanied by Višvāmitra. Dharma entreated him to refrain from his intention, and Indra informed him 44 that he, his wife, and son, had conquered heaven by their good works." Harišcandra declared that he could not go to heaven without the permission of his master the cāņdāla. Dharma then revealed himself. When this difficulty was removed, Harišcandra objected to go to heaven without his faithful subjects. This request was granted by Indra and after Višvāmitra had inaugurated Rohitāšva, the king's son, to be his successor, Harišcandra, his friends and followers, all ascended in company to heaven. There he was induced by the sage Nārada to boast of his merits and this led to his expulsion from heaven. As he was falling he repented for his fault and was forgiven. His downward course was arrested and he and his followers dwell in any aerial city, which, according to popular belief, is still visible occasionally in mid-air. The indignation of Vasistha at Višvāmitra's insatiableness produced a quarrel, in which their mutual imprecations changed them to two birds, the Šarāli (àdî) and the Baka.310 In these forms they fought for a considerable term until Brahma 310. Adì is a kind of heron, and Baka is the crane, the former being of a portentous height of 2,000 yojanas ( = 18000 miles) and the latter of 3090 yojanas. Their very movements would shake the earth, how much more when they pull up their energy to kill each other. Ref. Mark, ch. 9.

This section may be concluded with two impressions : 1. The Vasistha- Visvāmitra rivalry, though a thing of the ancient past, is a reality in the conception of the Purāņas. In fact, it is never doubted. Similarly, it was the belief that Visvámitra was born in a Ksatriya race, but elevated himself to Brāhmanhood by penance. 2. Secondly, under cover of tradition, new stories have sprung up to illustrate the mutual hatred of the two sages. The story of Saudāsa Kalmãsapãda took its origin in the BD312 but expanded with fanciful structure in Mbh. and the Purāņas. The first record of Trisañku story was in the Epics (Rām. and Mbh.) and further elaborated in the various Purāņas. The story of Hariscandra germinat- ing in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa, in which the sages are not enemies if not friends of each other, transformed itself into a classic as it were, to depict the very climax of their enmity. Justification for all this fabrication is that unshakable, mysterious Tradition ! VIII RECENT OPINIONS In the study of the life history of the sages Vasistha and Visvámitra, who are reputed personalities from Vedic times, we have naturally to delve deep into the literature of the Vedas for a true understanding. As time advanced and tradition spread through diverse channels, it is natural that the original structure of their story got hazy if not distorted. John Muir very effectively advocated a return to the study of the originals. He said :313 " The Vedic hymns being far more ancient than the Epic and Purāņic complications must be more trustworthy guides to a knowledge of the remotest Indian antiquity. While the epic poems and the Purāņas no doubt embody numerous ancient traditions, yet these have been freely altered according to the caprice or dogmatic views of later writers, and have received many purely fictitious additions. The Vedic hymns on the contrary have been preserved unchanged from a very remote period and exhibit a faithful reflection of the social, religious and ecclesiastical condition of the age in which they were composed and of the feelings which were awakened by contemporary occurrences. As yet there was no conscious perversion or colouring of facts for dogmatic or sectarian purposes.... It is here therefore that we may look for some light on the real relat ons between Vasistha and Višvāmitra." 311.

The germ of the story is however seen in the TS and the Brähmaiias, which depict that Vasistha's sons were killed by the Saudãsas. The sage then saw the rite of forty-nine nights etc. to obtain progeny as well as to take revenge against the Saudãsas. 4 Vasistho hataputro ' kâmayata vindeya prajām abili Saudãsãu bhaveyam iti ' cf.

Max Muller ASL p. 37,</page><page sequence="201">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 323 The whole inquiry centres round the following issues : (1) The identity of the two sages. (2) Had Višvāniitra any claim for kingship by birth or by acquisition ? (3) Did Vasistha and Višvāmitra ever hate each other? It is acknowledged on all hands that both Vasistha and Višvāmitra were highly esteemed as Rsis, seers of entire Maņdalas of the Rgveda. That one was a Brahmrsi and the other a Rāj arsi promoted to the rank of Brahmasi is an idea quite foreign to the Veda. Regarding Višvāmitra, the Vedic Index says314 44 There is no trace of his kingship in the RV, but the Nirukta (II 24) calls his father Kusika, a king ; the Aitareya Brāhmaņa (VII 18.9) refers toŠunašsepa as succeeding to the lordship of the Jahnus as well as the divine lore of the Gāthins, and the Pancavimša Brāh- maņa (xxi.12.2) mentions Višvāmitra as a king. But there is no real trace of this kingship of Višvāmitra. It may probably be dimissed as mere legend with no more foundation at most than that Višvāmitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even this is doubtful."315 Regarding the strife between Visistha and Višvāmitra, Oldenberg holds that it " is not to be found in the Rgveda. On the other hand, Geldner is hardly right in finding in RV a compressed account indicating the rivalry of Šakti, Vasistha's son, with Višvāmitra, the acquisition by Višvāmitra of special skill in speech and the revenge of Višvāmitra who secured the death of Šakti by Sudās's servants."316 These pictures, we have seen, were only supplied by tradition, 317 and not by the text of RV. As we look back at the Veda, through the colourful foreground of legendary matter provided by later literature, the mind is so caught up by the tales and hence somewhat vitiated in its appreciation of the Vedic origin. One is apt to be guided away by high authorities like the Brhaddevatā and the Sarvānukramaņī when they introduce the Rgvedic passages in an attractive legendary setting. These works themselves are ancient and moreover they have the unassailable Tradition to inspire credence. Thus in the Vasistha-Višvā- mitra relationship, to quote tradition or even to imagine it will not be subject to any doubt. So eminent a seer was Vasistha, heaven-born ; how ever could a mortal like Višvāmitra, himself seer though, vie with him ? In a controversy, or a philosophic discussion in a sacrificial essembly (sadas), Višvāmitra could not stand the attack of Vasistha's son the learned Šakti, with the result that he was silenced. Bearing a grudge against Šakti, Višvāmitra bided his time and with the help of the Saudāsas brought about his death. Now Vasistha the aggrieved father had to take notice of it all ; hence, he saw the Rāksoghna-sūkta or perform a rite of forty- nine nights to avenge the death of his son or sons.318 This is a perfectly reasoned 314.

The meaning of the mantras bears no relevancy to the fancied story.319 The Sākti- Višvāmitra controversy is superimposed on RV III 53.15-16 ; and the killing of Šakti on RV VII 32.26 - these are sufficient to illustrate the above contention that the later stories have had no foundation in the original text. Then tradition alone is their resort ; and tradition is mysterious and has to be regarded for the very reason, perhaps ! Regarding the veracity of the Vasistha- Višvāmitra strife, the findings of Maurice Bloomfieķl are very valuable.320 In his Rgveda Repetitions, he has pointed out how as many as four consecutive verses are common to the Man dalas of Vasistha and Višvāmitra : (VII 2.8-11 =111 4.8-11). Both are Aprl-hymns. Besides, the two Books share no less than 14 lines in common. Speaking of groups of stanzas repeated in the Rgveda, Bloomfield observes : 44 There comes to mind in this connection the traditional hostility of the Višvāmitras, the reputed authors of the 3rd book and the Vasisthas, the reputed authors of the 7th book. This centres about the so-called Vasistha-dvesinyab (RV III 53.21-14) which are sup- posed to contain a curse of the Višvāmitras against the Vasisthas. As early as TS 3.1.7.3; 5.4.11.3, Višvāmitra and Vasistha are opposing parties in a Vihava321 or conflicting call upon the gods. Roth and Geldner regard the traditional hostility of the two rsi clans as old. But the hymns do not express it. At least, it is strange that their two Äpri-hymns III 4 and VII 2 share no less than four stanzas word for word. We should expect diversity there if anywhere." Having started so well with almost a pledge that one has to look back to the Vedas322 for the truth of the legends, one finds the versatile scholar J. Muir succumb to the influence of the legends narrated in later literature. Relying on the veracity of these he brought to bear quite serious thought over the transformation which had come upon the alleged Vasistha-Visvāmitra feud in successive ages and put forward certain generalisations like "contests between the Bráhmans and Ksatriyas" apparently for superiority.323 The contests however ended in glorifying the qualities of the Brahman or the principles and modes of life for which he stood. In recent times, F. E. Pargiter pursued the study, especially of the Purāņas, on the same lines and, postulated the theory of two traditions in ancient history and legnd, viz. the Bráhmana tradition and Ksatriya tradition. In so doing he laid at the former's door the blame of distorting facts to suit its own purpose of maintaining 319t Supra and notes 38 and 155-157. 320.

He would have rendered signal service to ancient history and tradition if, instead of eking out the subtle but harmful distinctions in tradition, he had concentrated on proclaiming the slender foundation on which such an undesirable structure of hatred was built. It is necessary to meet the arguments and theories advanced in the book : An- cient Indian Historical Tradition, but it maybe permissible to offer some remarks on the perspective of the dissertation as a whole. Pargiter has made a profound study of the Purāņas. He perceives two currents of tradition, the BrāhmanicaI and the Ksatriya ; the former reflected in the Samhitās, the Brāhmaņas and other Vedic books, and the latter reflected mostly in the Epics and the Purāņas. One cannot deny the existence, from time immemorial, of a twofold tradition in any given age. The version of a story, for instance, among the literate based 011 books and the version among the less literate common folk which is based on hearsay: these two represent this twofold tradition. But Pargiter has viewed this most natural sociological aspect in a wrong perspective inasmuch as he has dubbed the twofold stream as two distinct entities, not infrequently, motivated by considera- tions of mutual exclusiveness among Brāhmaņas and Ksatriyas. In this kind of interpretation, he takes inspiration evidently, as pointed out above, from Dr. John Muir who, in his Original Sanskrit Texts, has developed a doctrine, par excellence, of Brāhmana- Ksatriya hostility. Such rivalry and conflict between individuals may have existed in ancient times ; but they were not part of anybody's or any group's beliefs and duties. Certain circumstances forced certain happenings, but it will be a great mistake to suppose that a vein or an undercurrent of rivalry and feud always subsisted these happenings from age to age. This is a precept which does incalcuable harm to the student of history and to the historical method of cultural investigation. The charge, for instance, is that the BrāhmanicaI priest dominated and got on with gifts etc. from kings. Be it so, what harm ? The conditions were such. The social codes were written by BrāhmanicaI priests, quite true. But why does the BrāhmanicaI priest write a thing which is not for the welfare of society and which is not acceptable thereto ? In the revolutions of ages, changes are inevitable ; that is the Law of the Universe. The āstika and the nāstika, like good and bad, have always been co -existent and thrive on each other, really. Every system or science has had supporters and dissenters, and we think each is strong as such, because of friends and foes. If we pile up the brick of the same size and symmetry one upon the other in one order only, the pile will 324. Pargiter AIHT (1922). The two traditions explained pp. 6-7 ; a ruthless attack on what he calls the brāhmanic tradition characterises the whole work (see pp. 10-11, chs. II and V). The author's study of ancient Indian literature has betrayed want of appreciation. To meet his arguments is outside the purview of this study, indeed. Suffice it to mention that Pargiter's conclusions are not, in general, commended by scholars, cf. Winternitz i HIL p. 521 n.3. " I doubt, however, whether we are justified in drawing the line between the Ksatriya tradition and thè brahmanical tradition as definitely as is assumed by Pargiter." cf. again, p. 523 n.2. In earlier years, Pargiter's views were contested by Prof, Keith : JRAS (1914) 1021 ff., (1915) 328 ff.</page><page sequence="204">326 H- L- HARIYAPPA topple down with one push ; but pile them lengthwise and breadthwise, the wall gains in resistance. That is fundamental law. But if we try to dissect and place the lengthwise and breadthwise bricks separately, where is the wall ? It is the first duty of man to visualise this unchangeable Law of Rta or Cosmic Order, with a desire for knowledge for its own sake. There he should try to separate them. The story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (R. L. Stevenson) is an instance in point. Genius will turn to perversity if its sharp edge is turned to selfish use. There have been frantic attempts in Vedic times to grapple the Unknown. Severest penance and will power have challenged the divine custodians of that hidden Truth, who have now and then relented, but on pain of the head splitting into a thousand pieces if the secret is divulged. There has been rivalry even among gods for this knowledge as is borne out by the story of Dadhyañc, to whom the Sun-god imparted the 44 madhuvidyã " (nectar of knowledge). Asked by the Ašvins, Dadhyañc explained the pledge and begged forgiveness. But the deft surgeons of heaven grafted a horse's head on the sage and persuaded him to give out the secret knowledge through the horse's mouth. The object achieved, they replaced the original head. The sage, however, did not escape the Sun's warth. That apart, experiments with truth, ridden to extremes, are fraught with danger to humanity. This does not require elaboration, living as we do in this Atomic Age. Should we then eschew knowledge and feel complacent with the maxim 'Ignorance is bliss ' ? No. We should gain knowledge ; but it should be subject to strict discipline, with passions and emotions sublimated into that stratum of peace and realisation of one's oneness with the Universe. Otherwise we are let down. In a miniature form Muir and Pargiter have propounded the twin traditions and unduly emphasised their apparent incompatibility, perhaps not realising that such an attempt will leave deep furrows in that vulnerable body called Society, which would be difficult to level up.325 There have been upheavels in the past in our Bharatavarsa ; every time, society has survived and stood on its tradition, with a reorientation needed by the times. It has emerged with a new and bright outlook. The historian's duty, however, is to unravel the strings, but never to pull them ! Taking into consideration so many activities 011 the part of the sages Vasistha and Visvāmitra, it appears marvellous for one individual to achieve so much in one life-time. As it is common in the legends, a Rsi does penance to please Indra ordinarily for a thousand years. Visvāmitra did penance, according to the Ràmâyana, for thousands of years, inali the four quarters put together. Vasistha is the priest of the Iksvāku race. Though once, perhaps at the beginning of his career, he had to give up his body on account of Nimi's curse, he was before long reborn and filled the same office as priest of the Iksvākus with all due respect and authority. Ever since he remained immortal down to the reign of Srl Rāma, son of Dašaratha. Moreover, he laid the whole world under a debt of gratitude, according to the Visņu-purāiia (III 3.9), by being the redactor of the Veda in the 325. Pargiter, it may be recalled, was a member of the Indian Civil Service.</page><page sequence="205">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 327 eighth Dvāpara.826 In the Râmâyana, both the sages are connected with the Iksvāku kings Trišaňku, Ambarïsa, Sudās and Dašaratha who are, from one another, separated by very long intervals, being 28th, 44th, 49th and 60th descendants respectively from the founder. The legends therefore take it for granted that the sages, by virtue of their austerities, were men of 4 miraculous longevity,' 4 possessed of a vitality altogether superhuman.'327 The common conception is that these holy sages are immortal ; they reside in heaven or somewhere in the Himalayan region, but invisible to mortals. Now and then they would descend upon the earth to bless the Believer. This tenet affords safe anchor for the popular mind ; for, what is impossible for the gods and saints of the golden Past ? Or, there is, to solve this riddle, the other expedient of counting a number of Vasisthas and Višvāmitras. Thus Pargiter discovers more than nine Vasisthas and three or more Višvāmitras.328 It is curious thing, however, that the old sages have mostly been designated by their gotras as it is the case even today in some tracts of India where people are known by their surnames. In the RV also, we are familiar with expressions Visvāmitrāķ, Vasisthāķ, Jamadagnayah etc. They and their descendants are seers of hymns in the various 44 family-books." It is reasonable to think that those that came after the great Rsis scrupulously kept up their traditions and distinguishing characteristics. But through centuries of life envisaged by the various incidents connected with the two sages, it would be unsound to count the number of them involved. And so far as the people are concerned it has been immaterial how many they were ; for their exemplary characteristics were important for posterity. The saintliness and forbearance, for instance, of Vasistha ; the dynamic activity and universal friendliness of Visvāmitra ; the one an embodiment of divine grace and the other an apostle of Human Endeavour (Purusakāra). IX SUMMARY 1 . The RV. presents Vasistha and Visvāmitra as great sages who were leaders of their respective clans and who established sound traditions. They are seers of maņdalas ; favourites of the gods Varuna and Indra respectively ; endowed with supernatural powers such as to render rivers fordable etc. Both befriended, and were priests of, Sudās, evidently on different occasions. Vasistha saved Sudās 326 ' The Vedas have already been divided 28 times in the course of the present or Vaivasvata Manvantara ; this division has always taken place in the Dvāpara age of each system of four yugas. In the first Dvāpara, Brahmā Svayambhü himself divided them ; in the sixth, Mrtyu (Death or Yama) ; whilst in the eighth Dvāpara, it was Vasistha who was the Vyàsa or divider.' MOST I, p. 330. 327. Ibid p. 362. 328. AIHT Ch. XVIII. It is unconvincing but amusing to see Pargiter hunt up the personal names of the several Vasisthas, Devarāj, Äpava, Atharvanidhi I and II, Šresthabhāj, Suvarcas etc. A similar attempt at unmaking different Višvāmitras by their names proved futile ch. XXI. The one name suggested i.e. Visvāratha is more likely an attribute than a name. See supra.</page><page sequence="206">328 H- L- HARIYAPPA from a disaster in his Battle with the Ten Kings (Dāšarājna), by steering him across the Parusņi before being overpowered by the enemies. Višvāmitra similarly led the same chieftan across the confluence of Vipäs and Šutudri ; and performed a thousand-offer-sacrifice before a distinguished gathering of the Āngirasas, the Bhojas and others. Both sages expressed themselves powerfully against enemies and constantly invoked the protection of the gods to be saved from their malignant attacks. 2. The first and only mention of a discord between them in the later Samhitãs is in the TS. It was a dispute between Vasistha on the one part and Višvāmitra and Jamadagni on the other, regarding a 4 conflicting call (vi-hava) of the gods', as Bloomfield puts it. The text however says that in that dispute, Jamadagni saw the 44 vihavya " hymn (RV X 128 «I)329 and drew away all the strength of the adversary. The TS also records, for the first time about Vasistha's bereavement caused by the death of his son or sons (hataputrab) and about his desire to wreak vengeance against the Saudāsas. On the other hand, the importance of both the sages for the Sacrifice is stressed. The SV and AV do not bear any sign of the rivalry ; the latter simply praises them uniformly. 3. The Brāhmaņas further emphasise the contribution to the sacrificial system made by the two sages, who together officiated at Harišcandra's sacrifice (AB). Vasistha and Višvāmitra are the Mind and Speech or Breath and Ear of the sacrifice ; they are, to the sacrifice, like two wheels to a chariot. At first Vaisthas alone were to be Brahma priests but later anyone who knew the job (ŠB). There is constant reference to Vasistha's bereavement and the sacrifice which he performed or the sâmans (Janitra) which he saw, to obtain progeny and to defeat the Saudāsas. PB is the only work to speak of a four-day rite of victory (sañjaya) which Višvā- mitra, king of the Jahnus (Jahnūnām rājā) performed to obtain the kingdom. Visvāmitra's martial spirit and sportsmanship are adverted to in connection with the Krosa and Rohita-Kuliya sāmans. It is remarkable that nowhere does any Brāhmaņa say or suggest that Višvā- mitra was responsible for Vasistha's misfortune. 4. Yäska does not refer to any hatred between Vasistha and Višvāmitra. Explaining the name Vipās, he says that the river got the name because of her loosening the bonds when Vasistha wanted to drown himself in her waters. It is in the Brhaddevatā that the first reference is made to the Vasistha- dvesinyab (Vasistha-haters) and an injunction that they should neither be recited nor heard on pain of the head splitting into hundred parts etc. Poignant reference is made to the calamity which befell Vasistha in that King Sudāsa, turning a demon, killed his hundred sons. Vasistha's pedigree has been described as also his funny experiences in a dream. There is an explicit statement that Višvāmitra, having ruled the Earth, attained the status of a Brahmarsi and also got a hundred and one 329. According to Sarvã. Vihavya is the Elsi of the hymn.</page><page sequence="207">RGVEDIC LEGENDS THROUGH THE AGES 329 sons. Višvāmitra is commended as a universal friend ; his conversation with the Rivers (Vipāš and Šutudrī) is stated as also his discomfiture at the hands of Šakti. The Sarvā. gives the pedigree of Višvāmitra and briefly refers to the conversa- tion with the Rivers ; does not at all mention the controversy with Šakti. There is a brief reference to Šunaššepa being adopted by Višvāmitra as his son and named Devarāta. Sarvā. relates for the first time the incident of Šakti thrown into fire by Saudāsas, whereas the incident is not recognised by the Tāņdaka (PB). Com- mentator Šisva, however, elaborates the Šakti -controversy as well as Šakti-murder. Commentator Durgâcârya refuses to comment on the Vasistha-dvesinyab, because he is a Kāpisthala Vàsistha. There have been instances of scribes having omitted that portion of the text and commentary as noticed by Max Müller and Roth.330 Nitimanjari says that Šakti survived the flames ! Vasistha-Višvāmitra hostility, thus, acquired wide publicity and implicit belief by the time of BD (400 B.C.), so much so that society was prone even to expunge from the Vedic text the few verses known as Vasistha-dvesinyafo. (So vehement is the protest in BD IV 117-120). Justice requires to be done to Višvā- mitra also. 5. In the conception of the Epics and the Purāņas, the belief in the Vasistha- Višvāmitra hatred has been firmly established. The Rāmāyaņa describes only the process of Višvāmitra's elevation to the status of a Brahmarsi. All revengeful stories are elaborated in the Mbh. and further in the Purāņas. Such inveterate hatred is fancied that Vasistha and Višvāmitra curse each other to become Adi and Baka (a kind of birds of portentous height) and then fight as such for years when only Brahmā could come and pacify them with suitable admonition. General impression would be that Vasistha patiently bore all the insults and onslaughts of Višvāmitra, whereas the latter prompted by jealousy at Vasistha's greatness always sought an opportunity to attack him. He even tried to kill him ; only the River Sarasvati tricked him at the risk of being cursed. Finally Višvāmitra's cruel treatment of Harišcandra is phenomenal. If all that did happen, it is hard to develop any sense of reverence to the Sage. But a perusal of the above historical investigation will prove that later literature does not reflect the truth. There has been so much of concoction and distortion. There is no doubt that all that was done, by whomsoever that was responsible, with bad taste and unworthy motive. Let us now look at the facts and realise that the two sages were not at all enemies of each other. 6. Recent opinion has on the one hand observed the hollo wness of what is called the traditional hostility between Vasistha and Višvāmitra, as revealed by a study of the most ancient literature ; and on the other, postulated that the same 330. MM RV* Vol. II, p. 23, SBE XXXII, p. xlvi note b.</page><page sequence="208">330 H- L- HARIYAPPA reflects a continued conflict between the Brāhmaņas and Ksatriyas to gain supremacy over each other and that later literature has not done justice to facts. 7. Conclusion : (a) Vasistha and Visvãmitra, already sages of high repute, in the comprehension of the RV, were not enemies of each other. Both of them, being eminent priests of the foremost kings of the day, had common enemies to contend with in the course of their expansion in India. (b) There have been definite instances of their co-operation for common good. Witness the system of sacrifices which they perfected. (c) Should there have been any differences between them, they must relate to some sacrificial technique or to a too personal jealousy at each other's success in their support to kings. But it was never such as to cause rivalry and hatred between clans and races. (d) It lacks vedic authority to say that Visvãmitra was a Ksatriya elevated to Brãhmanhood. Apart from orthodox tradition, researches point to the fact that the caste held sway over the people during a very late period of the Rgvedic Age.331 As Vasistha and Visvãmitra belonged to the hoary past even at the time of Rgvedic compilation, it will be short-sighted to attribute any varņa to them. In the words of Bloomfield, the RV presupposes ' a long antecedent activity ' and represents 4 the mixed final precipitate of a later time.'332 Even if in that remote age they did observe the distinction of varņas, it was only one of profession and not of birth.333 (*») To make Visvãmitra responsible for Vasistha's misfortune is unjust, in the absence of any tangible evidence. In later fabrications they have been allowed to wreak vengeance against each other, sufficiently. They are quits. ( f ) Vasistha is saintly, is an embodiment of all that is best in man and god; therefore he is Vasistha. Visvãmitra is brilliant, an embodiment of Human Endeavour (Purusakãra), a self-made Ýogin and friend to all. It behoves us to transcend jealousy, hatred and acrimony, and rise to heights of sympathy, grace and good- will. 331. HIL p. 66. 332. RVR p. 646. 333. Mbh. XII 188.10.
