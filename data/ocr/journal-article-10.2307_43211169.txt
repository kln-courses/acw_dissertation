<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PAST CONFRONTS THE PRESENT: LYRIC PROTEST IN THE WORKS OF ROMUALDAS GRANAUSKAS AudronèB. Willeke , Miami University (Ohio) It appears paradoxical, yet it is nonetheless possible for a conservative mes- sage to have a revolutionary thrust. In Soviet Lithuania the official position as- cribes to literature an important role in building a "new society" by helping to develop the consciousness of the reading public. This implies, among other things, the repudiation of a pre-Communist past allegedly tainted by class strug- gle, exploitation, poverty, and ignorance. Writers are expected to deal critically with those residues from the past that have survived in the new order. Traditional values and ways of life are perceived as anachronisms and impediments to pro- gress. The prose narratives of Romualdas Granauskas represent an important departure from the official line. Choosing as a major theme the confrontation of traditional values with those of the present, Granauskas* works demonstrate the need for continuity, for preservation of traditions and cultural identity. Within the Soviet Lithuanian context Granauskas' conservative message and his nostalgic reverence for the past convey an indirect protest against the ideology of the "new society." Born in 1939, Granauskas began to publish his first short stories in the periodical press in 1954. Thus far, two collections of his narratives have been published. His first book, Treetops {Medīiiļ virìUnès ), containing thirteen short sketches and stories, appeared in 1969. A second anthology, Bread Eaters (Duonos valgytojai), published in 1975, includes fourteen stories, the longest of which are "The Offering of the Bull" ("Jaučio aukojimas") and "Alone" ("Vienas"). Since then, Granauskas has published several additional works in periodicals, including the story "Northern Wind,"1 the monodrama "A Rose Bloomed in the Dark,"2 and a series of excerpts from a narrative cycle entitled Bružās.3 Although not a prolific writer, Granauskas is nonetheless both an influ- ential and a controversial one. His story, "The Offering of the Bull," stirred considerable discussion among readers and critics in Lithuania when it first ap- 299 JBS, Vol : XIII, No. 4 (Winter 1982)</page><page sequence="2">300 Journal of Baltic Studies peared in 1973. In an article tracing present stylistic tendencies in Lithuanian prose, the Soviet Lithuanian critic Elena Bukeliené chose Granauskas as most representative of a trend which she termed "romantic," in contrast to the estab- lished "realistic-objective" style.4 The aim of this study is to examine the narrative techniques that Granauskas uses to confront the past with the present. An analysis of the imagery in the story "Bread Eaters" reveals a system of reciprocal but contrasting images that represent two conflicting value systems. These images are generated indirectly; that is, they are located within the consciousness of the fictional characters by a skillful use of "narrated monologue." Finally, I will examine how these images acquire symbolic breadth and emotional impact by association with Christian ritual and with a pre-Christian, anthropomorphic view of nature. In a review published in 1977 Granauskas expressed admiration for writers such as Sholokhov and Faulkner because "they stand with both feet in their native clay . . . and covered with this clay they speak in their native language about their country, about the concerns of their people, and these concerns are understood by the whole world; they sink deeply into the head and heart."5 The settings of Granauskas' stories, too, are firmly rooted in "native clay"- the conflict between old and new usually takes place in present-day, rural Lith- uania.6 Through the everyday lives of old peasants and collective farm workers Granauskas raises universal questions about human life and values. The story "Bread Eaters"7 describes one Sunday in the lives of four people, members of two generations, who live together in a farm cottage: old Rimkus and his wife share their home with their grown daughter Mary tè and with her husband, a truck-driver who remains unnamed. The day passes uneventfully from dawn to dusk in a succession of humble chores, as the old Rimkus couple busily prepares to bake bread. Once each year the couple keeps up the tradition of making a few loaves of bread from rye grown on a small patch. The son-in-law, waking up in the morning with a hangover, finds the exertions of the old people foolish and annoying. He escapes the bustle by going to buy cigarettes and bread at the store. Here he spends the day drinking and talking with his cronies. The son-in-law is eager to shake the mud of the farm from his feet by building a house in town. He regrets his decision to have married the farm girl Maryté instead of the pros- perous store clerk Vanda. Meanwhile, his wife Maryté, in her late twenties and still childless, has stayed at home to do the chores, knowing that her husband will return drunk. She is torn between affection for her parents and the desire to move into town, so that in a home of her own she can finally have children. The story concludes with the evening meal; Rimkus and his wife are joined by a group of old neighbors with whom they share the freshly baked bread. These simple activities and interactions are related by alternating the per- spective of the story among the four principal characters. Granauskas uses a flexible form of third-person narration that imperceptibly shifts back and forth between an external narrator and the internal psyches of the four fictive charac- ters. For example, in the following passage the son-in-law is described as he walks</page><page sequence="3">Lyric Protest in Granauskas 301 to the store: Now he is walking out of the woods, he breaks off a branch, pulls off the leaves- he 's got a whip. He approaches the store beating the grass stalks, doesn't break them, only the heads of the grass bend to the ground. They won't spring up again, he thinks, not even after the rain, never. Maybe there won't be any people yet by the store. He hopes there'll be some. He imagines Vanda 's face and her white hair, even smells the fragrance of recently washed floors. Her room always smelled like that; it wasn't so long ago. After all, he never said he'd marry her. Still it's better not to meet her alone in the store one to one. What would they say first?8 The passage gradually shifts from the narrator's external description of a man walking to that man's mind and this shift is signaled by the customary phrase "he thinks." However, in the following sentences ("Maybe there won't be any people yet by the store. He hopes there'll be some.") the perspective has an ambiguous quality. The third-person pronoun "he" is retained and thus the presence of an external narrator is perceptible, yet the style of the language is colloquial and associative ("Her room always smelled like that; it wasn't so long ago.") giving the impression that the exact thoughts of the man are being con- veyed in his own words. I will use the term "narrated monologue," coined by Dorrit Cohn, to refer to this mode of rendering consciousness in the third per- son, a term synonymous with the French "style indirect libre" and the German "erlebte Rede."9 Because in "narrated monologue" the third-person form is retained, this technique allows the voice of the narrator and of the figure to blend imperceptibly, creating a two-in-one effect, and permitting subtle transi- tions between external and internal perspective.10 However, Granauskas uses this subjective narrative technique not in order to analyze unique aspects of the individual psyche, but rather to uncover the dif- ferent ways in which characters relate to their environment. His characters are differentiated principally by the physical sensations and concrete images that pass through their consciousness. In her discussion of language in "The Offering of the Bull" Violeta Kelertas has pointed out that for Granauskas "consciousness consists of layers of images which are always concrete and, therefore, describ- able."11 The image of the beaten grass in the above-quoted passage is a subjec- tive one; it is generated within the consciousness of a fictional character and may seem at first glance to be merely an incidental detail. However, within the story this image is juxtaposed to one which is related, but contrasting in meaning. Old Rimkus walks ahead of his son-in-law along the same path through the fields. He observes the blue blossoms of the potato plants and the white butterflies that swirl about his head as he turns to look back at his home. Later in the day, the image of the blooming potato plants and the swirling butterflies enters his con- sciousness again as he drops off to sleep. When he awakens from his afternoon nap, this remembered scene continues to preoccupy him: "Why do those pota- toes stay with me today, as though I've never seen them before?" The two recip- rocal images- broken grass stalks and blooming potato plants- acquire through</page><page sequence="4">302 Journal of Baltie Studies juxtaposition a significance that transcends their subjective and seemingly in- cidental origin as they come to represent two opposing value systems. The blooming potatoes, recurring images in the old man's consciousness, express his deep attachment to his environment, his appreciation for its natural beauty. By contrast, the broken grass stalks reflect the carelessly destructive, unfeeling relationship of the son-in-law to his surroundings. The central image of the story, bread, also appears in dual form, with both positive and negative significance. While the task of bread-making is a difficult one for the old Rimkus couple, it provides the occasion for a communal celebra- tion. Rimkus takes pleasure in inviting his neighbors to share the home-baked bread and the fresh milk with them. Thus, the evening meal becomes a sort of ritual in which the old people reaffirm their traditional way of life. The bread is their sons, fields, neighing horses, sounds of ringing iron in the smithy, logs covered with hoarfrost on wagons from the woods, the longing to live a long and just life. The mük is their daughters, bams, clean towels by the well, a white face waiting behind the crooked glass, the desire to die gently and peacefully, (p. 257) The eating of the bread signifies solidarity and human fellowship-an empty chair with bread and milk placed before it marks the place of a neighbor who had died recently. However, the positive image of bread has its negative counter- point in the loaf of bread that the son-in-law buys and brings home from the store. This bought bread, acquired by simply passing a coin across the counter, represents no personal commitment, no individual effort. Stripped of meaning for the individual, the bought loaf of bread has also lost its communal significance. The companions with whom the son-in-law spends the day outside the store are simply interested in making use of him-they buy him wine expecting favors in return. When he staggers home alone and drunk, carrying his loaf of bread, Rimkus' wife momentarily mistakes him for a black crow, omen of misfortune, that she always chases from her garden. These contrasting pairs of images, associated with two generations, represent divergent value systems and attitudes toward life. By means of these concrete, yet subjective images, Granauskas confronts the past with the present, and with- out any direct narrative commentary he demonstrates the superiority of tradi- tional commitments. The new value of mobility, on the other hand, exemplified by the truck-driving son-in-law, is shown to result in alienation and aimlessness. The critic A. Zalatorius has noted the emphatic use of paired numbers in the nar- rative which structurally underscore the duality of the images and of the theme.1 2 Granauskas is deeply concerned with the problem of continuity. In his works an individual life appears meaningful when it is linked by firm ties to past and future generations. Human beings harbor a natural desire to see their way of life and their values perpetuated in the lives of their children. This instinctive aspira- tion appears to be threatened in the present, the bond between generations is abruptly broken, and the individual life, separated from its natural cycle, seems meaningless and insignificant. In "Bread Eaters" the problem of threatened</page><page sequence="5">Lyric Protest in Granauskas 303 continuity is presented through the images that occur in two dreams of Rimkus' wife. In the first dream she sees vast, empty fields, like those after a potato har- vest, or after haying. These barren fields are devoid of life; only a few small mounds mark the graves of parents, children, and neighbors. The image of the barren fields mirrors the daughter's childless marriage and conveys the old woman's pessimistic view of the future. In her second dream the wife waits at the gates for someone to come home, but the path remains empty. Returning to the house she finds it deserted and full of rubble. Her dream expresses the realiza- tion that her children will not provide the desired affirmation and continuity to her life. Old Rimkus, however, nurtures some hope that a future generation may again rediscover the values of the past. As he looks at the fertile and blooming potato fields he muses, "How strange is the life of young people today, how dif- ficult it will be for them to die, unless the grandchildren will learn a lesson from their parents and will begin to live, loving everything" (p. 243). In the themat- ically related story "Alder Thickets" ("Alksnynai") an elderly farm couple spends Sunday morning awaiting the arrival of a yellow bus that may bring their children from the city for a visit. The mood of waiting and disappointment is expressed by subjective, lyrical imagery. The smoking chimney of his cottage appears to the man like a sacrificial altar, the pagan Lithuanian "aukuras," with its eternal flame. He expresses his desire for continuity through the image of the alder thicket that surrounds his farmstead: He only wanted that his life, though insignificant, continue to branch forever like a tree: into his children, grandchildren, and even further people, who will live encir- cled by the familiar alder thickets, and everything there will be entwined -branches, roots, new growth, and he himself will lie deep under those roots, and the silent long- ings of his spirit will never die. (p. 163) But his deepest longing has been betrayed; his children have scattered into stone cities like kernels of grain that fall on a hard wooden floor instead of on a warm field (pp. 162-63). Yet despite the bitterness and the betrayal, the old couple will continue to hope and to perservere.13 As is evident from the examples mentioned, Granauskas selects his imagery from the natural elements of the countryside. However, by deliberate association with Christian ritual and with a pre-Christian, anthropomorphic view, this natural imagery acquires broad, symbolic significance. So, for example, the eating of bread becomes associated with the ritual of the Last Supper, symbolizing both a farewell and an affirmation of hope. In the story "Alder Thickets," the image of the grain that falls on a hard surface recalls Christ's Parable of the Sower and the Word of God. Also characteristic of Granauskas' style are frequent anthropo- morphic descriptions of material objects and animals. For example, the story "Bread Eaters" opens with a paragraph in which the narrative point of view is located in the farmyard as objects gradually emerge into view with the approach- ing dawn:</page><page sequence="6">304 Journal of Baltic Studies It's not clear yet on what side the sun will rise; no red color is visible as yet; only the black farmyard trees move closer to the door, and something -so vaguely large - lies by the doorstep with its faintly visible face turned up to the roof, while one crooked arm reaches across the yard up to the well. It's the oval threshold rock and the gravel path, and all the other paths are still lying immobile on the grass, waiting for someone's footsteps to awaken them from their early morning stiffness, (p. 235) Later in the same paragraph the threshold rock will hear how inside the cottage waking thoughts grope along the walls, wanting to go outside. Significantly, the world of objects awaits the human presence in order to come to life, while the waking human consciousness is immediately filled with concrete images and sensations of its physical environment. Thus the distinction between the human and the non-human sphere is minimized. For Granauskas the place of human beings in the scheme of nature is "somewhere between the grass and the trees," as he states in the story "Grass" ("Žolé"),14 a humble position that implicitly denies claims of human otherness. Granauskas relates his natural images to Christian tradition and to a pre- Christian anthropomorphic view in order to tap the common reservoir of sym- bols, images, and emotional responses shared by his Lithuanian readers. In a recent review (1981) Granauskas commented on the function of symbols in art in a way that made quite explicit his own practice as a writer: However, the closer an aesthetic image is related to a system of symbols that is familiar to us, the more suggestive and meaningful it becomes, thus more aesthetic. In this way it moves closer to poetry, delighting us not by individual details, nor by concreteness and plasticity, but rather, in uniting word and meaning, it [the image] at the same time unites those people, for whom that meaning is familiar and intimate.1 5 In this passage Granauskas emphasizes the communal aspect of imagery, the power of images to evoke a collective response. Literature, by arousing such a collective response, can strengthen the sense of belonging to a cultural entity. When the Soviet Lithuanian critic Bukeliené applies the term "romantic" to Granauskas' works, she uses this term to designate the subjective, emotional, lyrical, and symbolic qualities of his style. The above discussion shows, however, that Granauskas' primary link to the romantic literary tradition lies in the key concept of organic unity. For Granauskas, human beings can retain their dignity and worth by integration in nature and in a cultural tradition. Such an integra- tion implicitly negates the concept of a "new society." The critic Stasys Lipskis, in his book The Horizons of the Contemporary Novelle, echoes the official Soviet position on the role of literature in creating a "new society" when he writes: "The struggle for the new is always a struggle for justice, for humanism, for human rights. Seeking the new means not only reflection, but a real struggle against the outdated and the anachronistic, those barriers and brakes to pro- gress."16 In the face of such ideological expectations Granauskas' work appears to be an anomaly. In the confrontation of past and present values his sympathy is</page><page sequence="7">Lyric Protest in Granauskas 305 clearly with the past. For him, hope for the future seems to lie in a rediscovery and reaffirmation of traditional, national values-in other words, in a continuity of the past into the future, not in radical change. Hope lies in a future generation that will learn again to love its "native clay." This conservative message is con- veyed in Granauskas' works by means of subjective narrative techniques that seek not the uniquely individual in the human psyche, but rather the communal experiences, images, and symbols. By evoking such symbols Granauskas intends to mobilize cultural solidarity. In discussing a novel by the Dirgéla brothers, Granauskas characterizes the principal themes of that work as "love, hope, and faith." However, he applies these cardinal virtues of Christian theology to the human sphere: "Love of family; hope in one's descendants, that they will spread and branch; faith in one's country, that it will be happy and free."1 7 This descrip- tion can serve to characterize Granauskas' own works as well, for beneath the confrontation of the past with the present lies the crucial issue of survival. This is both a specifically Lithuanian problem and a general, human concern, embracing the fate of individuals, families, and cultural communities.

There the confronta- tion of two value systems is placed into the historical past. The external events describe the forced Christianization in the thirteenth century of a Baltic tribe, the Couronians, by the conquering Germans. 7 "Bread Eaters" ("Duonos valgytojai") was first published in Nemunas, No. 5 (1970), 12-15 and was reprinted in 1975 as title story in the anthology of the same name. 8 Duonos valgytojai (Vilnius: Vaga, 1975), 245. Further page references to this anthology will be given in the text. 9 Dorrit Cohn, Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fic- tion (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1978). 10 Granauskas has also experimented with a number of first -person techniques for render- ing consciousness. In &lt;4The Offering of the Bull," for example, the entire story is nar- rated through a form of self-address: the first-person narrator addresses himself with the familiar, second-person "you." The story "Wild Strawberries" ("Žemuogés," in Medžiy virSûnès, [Vilnius: Vaga, 1969], 19-22) is related by a young adolescent who goes to pick berries in the woods with his girl and with a male rival. His thoughts and feelings, conveyed in the form of first-person interior monologue, are interrupted periodically by</page><page sequence="8">306 Journal of Baltie Studies the actual spoken words of his companions, creating an effective interplay between fancy and reality. In his most recently published story "Northern Wind" (1977) Gra- nauskas has begun to break with the narrative convention which requires that overt author- ial presence be avoided. Here the events are related from the perspective of the main character, Domarkas, using the above-described forms of unobtrusive narration: narrated monologue, first-person interior monologue, and dialogue. At the climax, however, the narrator suddenly interrupts the action in order to provide a flashback into the past. This direct and unexpected intrusion of the narrator into the course of events breaks the in- tensity of the story, while at the same time it involves the reader in the narrative process, the traditional alliance between narrator and reader. 11 Violeta Kelertas, "Language in Contemporary Lithuanian Narrative," Lituanus, 23, No. 4 (1977), 40. 12 A[lbertas] Zalatorius, "Novelés semantika, erdvè ir laikas," Lietuvos TSR Moksly aka- demijos darbai , 61 (1977), 167-68; Zalatorius has listed the following examples of paired numbers: two parts of the cottage, four principal characters, eight eyes (emphasized by the narrator), four, six, eight, or twelve armloads of wood, two and eight bottles of wine, two and four drinkers, eight farmsteads, eight places at the table (p. 171). 1 3 A similar hope in a future spiritual rebirth leads the pagan priest in t4The Offering of the Bull" to sacrifice himself for his people.
