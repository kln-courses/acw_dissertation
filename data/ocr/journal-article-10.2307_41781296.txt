A Polynesian tiki is a male figure that represents Polynesia, 2003 a deified ancestral chief or god, although female and sexless examples are Whale ivory also known. When I had completely cleaned the small pendant, I 1.18 inches fcigfc realized that this was the only excavated ornament of its kind from the Austral Islands in the South Pacific. Although stylized, the tiki's form is recognizably human, with eyes notched in the head, a chiefly collar, folded arms and legs represented by chevrons, and fanning toes, all typical elements of Austral art. tiki is drilled through the head and was probably used as a pendant on necklace. Austral necklaces also had other carved images symbolic of a chiefs wealth and virility - phallic- shaped (an double sets of balls representing testicles; and small rectangles with concave sides resemble the wooden seats made for the islands chiefs, pendants location in the marae reinforces the idea that it was sacred place reserved for chiefly and priestly classes. The Austral islanders are known for their woodcarving on objects such as drums and ceremonial paddles, but few carved tikis still exist. When the inhabitants of the archipelago converted to Christianity in the early 1800s, they destroyed all "heathen" idols; only a handful of anthropomorphic pieces of Austral art were salvaged by European visitors. For me, uncovering this tiki was an incredible thrill. I like to think that somehow he guided me to the place where I found him. - Robert Bollt, Director, Rurutu Excavation Project •8 ARCHAEOLOGY • May/June 2009</page></plain_text>
