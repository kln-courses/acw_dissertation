<plain_text><page sequence="1">292 Monumenta Nipponica, XXXIV, 3 Uzuragoromo by YOKOI YAYUIY Author's Preface THESE lackluster bits and pieces that I have so wretchedly patched together I call my quail cloak. Indeed, if it is to be like the quail, it shall hide itself deep in high grass, never known to man, not even for the briefest moment.49 In Praise of the Nara Fan50 The first haibun piece is one of the more popular in Uzuragoromo, and is almost always included in anthologies as an example of the haibun genre. Yayu7 takes the common, everyday leaf fan-not the elegant and stylish folding fan-and with gentle humor and the uncharacteristic literary device of the pathetic fallacy creates a charming encomium to the fan by its refreshed and grateful owner. The date of composition is unknown, although external evidence suggests it was written before Yayz7 was thirty years old. IN the days of the Nara emperors5" what measure of imperial favor did this fan gain to become a special product of the region? 49 What would seem to be a straightfor- ward observation on the habitat of quail is actually an allusion to a poem in Ise Mono- gatari, section 123. It is related that the indefatigable lover and courtier, Ariwara no Narihira ~ERAEJI , 825-80, was tiring of his current mistress and dispatched the following verse to her in Fukakusa, literally, 'Deep Herbage', in present-day Kyoto prefecture: 'Were I to leave behind / The house where I have come calling / Through the years, / Even more might Fukakusa / Turn to moor.' The lady replied: 'Should it become a moor, /I shall turn quail / And call to you there. / Would you not come hunting / Even for the briefest moment?' 50 Uchiwa, written PM by Yayu. This is the round, non-collapsible, leaf-like fan, not the ogi M, or folding type. Uchiwa is usually written by combining the two characters P!1M. Yayu may have been influenced in his choice of the fan as a topic for a haibun essay by at least three earlier haibun pieces: one is in Fuzoku Monzen RA f4ZR, Book 10, and titled Uchiwa no San MMR; another is in Wakan Bunso tnfACA, Book 5, and is also called Uchiwa no San, but written PSI*; the third is the oldest, appearing in the earliest haibun collection, Takaragura -T, Book 2, under the title Ogi. In dealing with the subject, however, Yayui was in no way influenced by these earlier essays, the first two of which are undistin- guished. 51 The first sentence is capped with a pillow word, or conventional prosodic epithet, associated with the name of the capital: aoni yoshi Nara WfJ IAM 'Ah! Nara of the blue earth!' This pillow word, which is found in Man'yosha, is said to derive from a pigment mined in the Nara area.</page><page sequence="2">YAYUJ: Uzuragoromo 293 In this world it is enough that a man be thoroughly versed in the art of his chosen calling only, even though he be without many other talents.52 And except to give birth to a breeze the leaf fan prudently undertakes no other tasks at all. It is of no use in song or dance, nor does it have the perversity of nature to flatter its owner in public by being folded elegantly away in his sash.53 Its life is perhaps like that of an itinerant monk54 who dismisses the world as though it were a mere scrap of wood.55 And unlike the folding fan it does not aspire to make its home in a box of paulownia wood.56 It is there to cool me in the evening beneath the moonflower and it stands guard by the pillow as I take my midday nap. When in the heart of man interest falls and the fall wind blows,57 it seems that this fan cannot even look forward with certainty to the summer that shall come again. Thus it shares lodgings with a wastepaper basket in a far corner of the storeroom, defiled by the paws of rats. And yet, it is most certainly superior to the folding fan which lies weathered and stripped of its paper. I have bared my soul to you, my fan. Cherish our intimacy and do not-Heaven forbid-let others know how I look as I lie naked on my bed. Hakama kiru Hi wa yasumasuru Uchiwa kana. The days I wear my hakama58 I set to rest My round leaf fan! 52 Tano it. From Lun yui, ix, 6. Confucius responds to criticism that although he is a learned man he has many skills: AMV. R+TfiTS. 44tt~. 'When I was young [my family] was poor, thus I developed many skills. [But] does the Gentleman have these? He does not.' This restrictive view of the Gentleman's role is reiterated by Kenko VA- in Tsurezure- gusa , section 122: Tano wa kunshi no hazuru tokoro nari, 'Too many skills are a source of shame for the Gentleman.' 53 In contrast, of course, to the chic folding fan. 54 Unsui 9M. The full phrase, attributed to the T'ang monk Feng Kan AF is HffNifAE, 'Drifting clouds and flowing water', and is a metaphor for the unsettled existence of an itinerant priest. 55 Ki no hashi tZ), a scrap of wood, that is, a mere trifle. The expression is found in Makura no Soshi tt#=T, section 5, where Sei Shonagon MAJPMA m laments the fall in station of young boys sent into the Buddhist priesthood. 'It is such a pity that they are thought of by outsiders as insignificant as wood scraps.' Ikeda Kikan MFHA, ed., Zenko Makura no Soshi hgtt# , Shibundo, 1956, I, pp. 17-8. Yayu, however, has turned the phrase around, making the priest contemptuous of worldly things, rather than an object of contempt himself. 56 The more expensive folding fan was often stored in such a box. 57 Hito no kokoro ni aki kaze tateba, literally, 'When in the heart of man interests fall wind blows.' The choice in translating this syntactical pun is between this literal and incomprehensible rendering, and a readable translation that does not fully retain the pivotal form of the Japanese. I have chosen the latter. The play is on aki, which can be taken to mean 'autumn' or 'disinterest', that is, fall or fall in interest. There is a third possible translation, one which ignores completely the peculiar structure of the original: 'When the autumn wind blows in man's heart.' 58 A pleated, skirt-like garment worn by men, usually on formal occasions. Only the folding fan would be considered the proper accessory.</page><page sequence="3">294 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxiv, 3 A Chronicle of Smartweed Blossom Place This piece is not, as the title seems to promise, a description of Yayu's hermitage, but a fanciful guide to an imagined retreat wherein kindred spirits, most certainly Taoists, gather to enjoy each others' company. The date of composition is not known. Yayi7 tells us that he is in another's service 'with both blade and brush', so we know that it was written before he retired in 1754. THE banana plant and the five willows were bathed in the light of their owners' virtue,59 and left behind unblighted fame, yet the hapless hackberry gave its name to a high-ranking priest,60 only to incur, in the end, his wrathful ax and thus bring into currency the names Tree Stump and Dug-out Pond. Although I have placed myself in my master's service with both blade and brush,6' I have, at the same time, a quiet retreat. This I call Smartweed Blossom Place.62 There is no particular significance in the choice of smartweed blossoms, save that the sight of the evening sun and morning dew on them gives me only pleasure, and this is not unrelated to the plant.63 I recalled with fondness Lord Shunzei's64 front yard and his poem that goes, in part, 'When the call of the mushroom monger is heard',65 and I was strangely moved by its forlorn aspect. Thus did I give my hut this name. 59 T'ao Yuan-ming RN and Matsuo Basho *MKSA,, respectively. T'ao, 365-427, also known as T'ao Ch'ien RUA, was one of the greatest of the pre-T'ang poets and a righteous man of learning. He is said to have been fond of gardening and to have had five willow trees growing by his house. He himself tells us of this sobriquet and his trees in a whimsical autobiographical snippet appro- priately titled Wu liu hsien sheng chuan H;PY6 tifz{3 ('The Story of Mr Five Willows'). Basho, whose name means 'Banana Plant', also took his pen name from the plant that grew by his house. This nature-oriented metonomy was not uncommon among East Asian intellectuals. 60 This story appears in Tsurezuregusa, section 45. A high-ranking priest named Ryogaku Alt was known as the Hackberry Priest because of such a tree near the monas- tery. Angered by this name, he chopped the tree down, only to be called the Tree Stump Priest. Infuriated, he dug out the stump, whereupon he was nicknamed the Dug-out Pond Priest. 61 Kenkan no shito ni mi o okinagara AIJ)O ftL* B;ktR t;i 6 . Kenkan, 'sword and crown', refers to both military and civil services, where position or function would be indicated by headgear. In this sense kan E is not unlike 'hat' in the expression, 'He wears many hats.' The translation 'blade and brush' is an attempt to retain the alliteration of the Japanese. The more common literary expres- sion for the civil-military dichotomy is bumbu 7M. 62 Ryokako -I. The graph N, translated as 'smartweed' here, is a term for the Polyg- onum family. It encompasses many varieties of herb, some pernicious, all of which are characterized by their bitter taste. 63 Sono hitomoto no yukari naki ni mo arazu. Yayfu alludes to Kokinshu #867: Murasaki no / Hitomoto yue ni / Musashino no / Kusa wa minagara / Aware to zo miru. 'For the sake of a single shoot / Of purple gromwell, / I look upon / All the grasses of Musashino / With fondness.' Yayui intensifies the allusion to the poem with the word yukari, 'nexus', which suggests yukari no iro, a poetical expression for purple. 64 Fujiwara Shunzei g1fFMM, 1114-1204. 65 According to Iwata, KUS, p. 25, the poem alluded to is not one of Shunzei's, but an anonymous waka appearing in Haikai Ruisen- shui %WMOX (1676), Book 5. The complete poem runs: 'When the early morning call / Of the mushroom monger / Is heard, / Even the smartweed in the garden I Comes into blossom.'</page><page sequence="4">YAYUJ: Uzuragoromo 295 My quiet abode stands next to that unearthly paradise, the village of the Taoist Immortals.66 It faces the mountains and sits by the sea, and there are rivers and fields about. The moon and the snow, the flowers and the birds provide me with the poetry of the four seasons. It is not at all dissatisfying to look upon these things, nor does the timeless evening wind blowing in the pines, nor even the pelting of the night rain in the bamboo grove sound wearisome to my ears. My hut is not distant from the gates of the city. Yet should one seek it out with walking stick and sandals-though he walk the calluses of a well-traveled Taoist on his feet-he will lose his way before he finds himself here at the gate where cedars stand at the foot of Mt Miwa.67 He will be bewitched by a fox in broad daylight68 and behold my hovel disappearing before his eyes as the broom trees did.69 Nor shall he meet anyone on Mt Utsu who will ask him where he goes, as did the priest ask of Ariwara Narihira.70 His quest would be like punting once more up the river in search of the elusive Peach Paradise of T'ao Yiuan-ming.7' If, on the other hand, he is one who knows both the tint and the fragrance of the plum blossom,72 and will talk with me about that which occupies my thoughts,73 he shall very soon come upon-perhaps in a jar as Fei Ch'ang-fang did74-the thatched gate he is seeking. Monozuki no Mushi wa kite nake Tade no hana. Should it suit your tastes, Bugs, come sound your call Amidst the blossoms of the smartweed. 66 Mukau no kyo ifE A) WN. One of Yayfi's relatively infrequent Taoist allusions, in this case one from Chuang Tzu , in the Ying- ti-wang )T-IE section. 67 From Kokinshu #982: 'Should you pine / For my hut / At the foot of Mt Miwa, / Come visit / At the gate where cedars stand.' 68 Hirugitsune -, a 'daylight fox', that is, one which leaves its lair during daylight hours. 69 An allusion to Shinkokinshui #997, attributed to Sakanoue no Korenori a h?gIJ 'There seem to be / Broom trees / At Sono- hara / Growing by my hovel, / But we do not meet.' It is said that near the village of Sonohara in Shinano there was a grove of broom strees which from afar looked like brooms. Korenori likens his lover to the trees because he only visualizes her, but is not with her. Similarly, Yayul's hut will disappear before its seeker's eyes as though the latter were bewitched by a fox. 70 Another allusion to a poem in Ise Monogatari, section 9, written by Narihira on encountering an itinerant priest near Mt Utsu in present-day Shizuoka prefecture. Narihira entrusts a letter, which includes the waka, to the priest to give to his love back in Kyoto: 'By Mt Utsu / In Suruga / Neither awake / Nor in my dreams / Do I meet my loved one.' 71 A reference to the story T'ao hua yuan chi RIM0:2 by T'ao Yuian-ming about a fisherman who discovered an arcadian paradise on earth, but having left it, was unable to find it again. For an English translation, see Cyril Birch, ed., Anthology of Chinese Literature, Grove Press, New York, 1965, pp. 167-8. 72 An allusion to Ki no Tomonori's poem in Kokinshui #38: 'Plum blossoms- / To whom shall I show them / If not you? / One who knows both tint and fragrance / Knows.' 73 Omou koto iu beki hito naraba, an allusion to a poem in Ise Monogatari, section 124: 'I shall say not / What I think / But remain silent, / For there is no one / Like me!' 74 An allusion to the story of Fei Ch'ang- fang RK, appearing in the biographical section of Hou han shu *jkt- (Book 72, fang shu )M, second half). Fei leaped into a jar to find that inside it was 'a sumptuous palace overflowing with delicious wines and foods'.</page><page sequence="5">296 Monumenta Nipponica, XXXIV, 3 An Explication on the Wooden Bokuri Sandal In Japanese this piece is a somewhat incongruous, if characteristic, blend of topical baseness and stylistic elegance. Yayz7's approach is light andprosopopoetic, although paradoxically, classical allusions are heavily relied on, and references to Buddhist practices give it a pseudo-sacred tinge. Bokuri sandals!7 Surely Su Tung-p'o76 on one of his spring outings spread beneath his bottom his sedge hat. How is it, then, you were not employed by Tsai Yu77 as a pillow for his head that summer day he was chastised by Confucius? When the sun shines and the weather is good and you find yourself with leisure time, I suppose you lie on your side underneath the veranda, and in the frosty night befriend the crickets,78 or watch the moon at a night-long sunrise service79 until it descends,80 all the while hanging suspended from a blind man's staff that leans against the wall. Although on rare occasions you are worn by acrobatic tightrope walkers and look down upon people from on high, your usual lot is to kneel at the footgear stone or play the stool on washday, in ignorance of the more sublime relationships of life. Thus are you a thing of the masses, and yet there was a time when you were transformed into a hunter's pipe, and sounded at his mouth.8' Having helped put an end to the life of a deer is the ultimate sin in a profoundly sinful life. Yet by being in harmony with the teaching of IkkyU,82 who said that a statue of the Buddha and a geta sandal are both carved from identical blocks of wood,83 you cut for the first time the straps84 that bound you to the wheel of transmigration. Now I must say that to call the elevated sandals bokuri and ashida, and the low ones geta," is an expedient, for it is a matter of the same thing taking different forms;` and thus we should make no distinction here based on what is exalted and what is base. Nonetheless, should we discuss, in [the usual antithetical aesthetics of] light verse, two forms, we should have to talk about the bokuri's clop-clop in the stillness of a snowy morning, and the geta's clackety-clack amidst the scurrying in a sudden evening rain. 75 There is a piece on bokuri 4FW sandals in the haibun collection Wakan Bunso, with the same title, Bokuri no Setsu. The tone is similarly fanciful, but the two pieces are otherwise not alike. 76 9,3 the pen name of Su Shih 9,K 1036-1101, poet and government official; he is often pictured wearing a sedge hat. 77 zT, a disciple of Confucius and an official of the state of Ch'i. Yayul here alludes to a well-known passage in Lu yut, Book 5 (Kung-yeh Ch'ang ia@:), in which Confucius censures Tsai Yu for his sloth: 'Rotten wood may not be carved nor a wall of manure or dirt plastered.' James R. Ware, tr., The Sayings of Confucius, New American Library, New York, 1955, p. 40. 78 From Shinkokinshad #518, attributed to Fujiwara Yoshitsune XWAff, 1169-1206: 'The cricket calls / And on the straw-mat bedding / This frosty night / I spread out just one cloak- / Am I to sleep alone?' 79 Himachi i 4, literally, 'sun waiting'. These were originally religious services held on</page><page sequence="6">YAYU: Uzuragoromo 297 The Biography of a Mortar The following piece differs from most of Yayui's haibun in that it is a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, the narrative building to conflict and its formally tragic resolution. The heroine is a rustic mortar who seeks her fortune in the city. This particular example of the pathetic fallacy in haibun was probably suggested by the first haibun collection, Takaragura, in which Yamaoka Genrin attributes human qualities and emotions to a kitchen mortar. Yayui, however, has borrowed no more than Genrin's title. 'The Biography of a Mortar' is laced with Chinese and Japanese classical allusions, and with puns, yet it is not without a whimsical charm. The sexual symbolism is, for haibun, uncommon. THERE once was a girl in the province of Bizen.87 Although she was born out in the country as far from the capital as the sky is from the earth, in appearance she much resembled the renowned Fuji.88 She began, it seems, to think it unbearable that she should rot away in a remote mountain village. Using both boat and horse, she arrived in the faraway capital. For a short time she temporarily stayed in the store front of an acquaintance until she was able to find a good position in a kitchen. It was a time when there was much bustle under the winter skies and the wind called forth all the leaves from the trees, a time when people throw away old things in the year-end clean-up and seek out new wares. No sooner had her service been settled than she became the wife of one known as auspicious days of the first, fifth, and ninth months. As the event became more secularized and pleasure-oriented with time, musicians and other performers, some of whom were blind, were hired to entertain. 80 Katabuku made no tsuki. The inspiration for this phrase is the Heian poetess Aka- zome'emon jr'OJ~f, in Goshaisha **&amp;, love poems, section 2: 'I could have retired / Straightaway, / But now the night has deep- ened, / And here I watch / The descendant moon.' 81 Apparently suggested to Yayui by a sentence in Tsurezuregusa, section 9: 'It has been said that the autumn deer will always respond to a pipe made of ashida sandals once worn by a woman.' 82 Ikkyui Sojun , 1394-1481, a priest of the Rinzai sect remembered best for his efforts to popularize Zen. 83 The statement attributed to Ikkyui appears in two sources, slightly different in each case: Ikkyd Zenji Kyoka Mondo -{f*XR kRM and Kokin Ikyokusha -j-liiA. 84 Hanao A,%, the thong of the sandal. 85 Bokuri, also called pokuri, ashida, and geta, are all wooden sandals. Ashida consists of a platform supported by relatively thin blade-like projections which are longer than those of the geta. The geta are similar, but lower, and are usually carved out of a single piece of wood. The projecting supports of the bokuri are actually broad enough to be considered as heel and sole. Like the geta, they are carved from a single block of wood. 86 Ittai bunshin (also read funshin) I;$t, 'one body, separate forms'. Yayui continues the train of Buddhist allusion begun with the reference to the killing of deer. In the Buddhist context, ittai bunshin refers to the many forms that the Buddha assumes to effect the salva- tion of humanity. 87 Bizen was known for its mortars. Wakan Sansai Zue tftQAtI1[, Chapter 31, charac- terizes the province's mortars as 'good', superior, in fact, to those made anywhere else. It attributes this to the suitability of the soil. 88 The heroine, being a Japanese mortar, was conical in shape.</page><page sequence="7">298 Monumenta Nipponica, XXXIV, 3 Pestle, and they hit it off right away.89 He bore no resemblance to Kashiwagi of the Right Palace Guard [although their names sounded alike], but was a man with the wild aspect of the pine,90 and at the same time a man of sincerity whose nature harbored not the slightest affectation. Thus his wife wore no lid to conceal her affection for him. At her tasks both day and night she toiled on in the same con- stant spirit; she desired only a relationship made fast as with rice paste, one that would last until she be crowned with hair as white as the creamy white snow of grated yam puree.9' They pledged a water-tight troth. But then there appeared a man named Sekkai,92 so graceful a figure with his fine-grained wood of the cypress, that once, when he had served at the palace, he had been known as The Nightingale. Late at night when they were working at similar tasks they would often be sprawled together under the sink. After this was caught by the eyes of the bamboo strainer, her life among her companions, who were hard to get along with in any case, became even more difficult. The gratuitous spouting of the unfeeling sake kettle and the crooked heart of the wooden ladle gave rise to talk of an affair. Even her friendship with the parching pan shrivelled and she was besooted dawn to dusk by the tea kettle. And there was the two-faced horseradish grater as well.93 Thus she had no one to turn to. Since tragically her face was soiled with salad dressing, 94 she bore the shame of the wife of Mai-ch'en. 95 She recalled to mind the Lady of Calligraphy of old [who had attempted suicide],96 and she also seemed to 1- -- ;allxr a-11_ ;__ '_ 4 ~L_ f h l; _4_1. 14- 4-he-f _'_ _ -4- __4il__ 4- A-o -;1 89 The pun is in the phrase uchiawase no ffuf tT c)A J b , literally, 'bang-together man and wife', which suggests the phrase ura-awase Abl no fdfu, 'a man and wife well suited to each other'. One woodblock edition has ra b instead of chi t, but this would seem to be a copyist's error, since uchiawase no fdfu suggests ura- awase no fdfu, but the reverse is not the case. KUS, p. 42. 90 Kashiwagi tz*, literally, 'oak tree', was a central figure in Genji Monogatari. Pestle is surikogi ifl4, which is perhaps close enough to Kashiwagi in sound to provoke mild amusement. Yayfi then observes that Pestle is a rough and honest fellow made of pine, or matsunoki **, again another like-sounding name. 91 Tororo shiraae no yuki itadaku made. This is a rare allusion to the patently sexual. There are three levels of meaning. The first is the literal statement about a snow-like salad dressing and grated yam. Two implicit images suggest themselves, however. One is the conventiontal sentiment of love faithful unto white hair and old age; the other-which is in harmony with the under- lying phallic-vaginal motif of the pestle and the mortar-is the image of semen. This sexual imagery is further enhanced by the phrase which follows: norigome no hana- renu naka, 'a relationship made fast with rice paste'. Norigome Yll* has the secondary meaning of semen. 92 Sekkai, usually written W;&amp; a scraping utensil used to clean the mortar. The word uguisu, 'nightingale', was also applied by women to this scraper. 93 Narazaka ya wasabi oroshi no futaomote. The first five syllables of this phrase are not translated. What in pre-modern times was called the Narazaka was a road between Nara and Kitsu in Yamashiro province which passed over a hill called Narayama. Accordingly Yayui uses it here because it is related in sound and geography in Man'yo5shu #3836: Narayama no / Konotegashiwa no / Futaomote / Kanimo kakunimo / Nejikebito no tomo. 'I am surrounded / By a host of churls, / The two-faced leaves / On the oaks of Nara- yama.'</page><page sequence="8">YAYfU: Uzuraroromo 299 night amidst the confusion created by rampaging rats, she leaped from the edge of the shelf, taking a piece out of her face and making herself uncomely. Thus it was that her master, outraged that she could no longer carry out her culinary tasks, denied her mending cement, although a wondrous remedy. She was torn from her mate and banished to the courtyard, but now and again during the rains of early summer she again joined the ranks of the pots and pans to catch rainwater that leaked through the roof. So now there was no opportunity for the tears of the Lady of the Ch'ang Wen Palace to dry.97 Here, too, she found it difficult to settle down. She rolled out to a well-side to be buried amongst the smartweed and goosegrass, after which not one soul came to comfort her in her sorrow. Yet presently, at a time, perhaps, when the dew had turned to frost and the calls of the insects at the fence had grown hoarse, she was picked up by the gatekeeper from a nearby temple and once again found herself within four walls. He transformed her into a hibachi, something she had never been before. She warmed sake and brewed tea and for one year endured her pain here, but soon the plum blossoms began to flutter down in the gentle rains of spring. The moxabustion of the second month done,98 she was emptied of even her ashes and planted with red peppers, but while this was pungent experience, she thought that if she accepted the situation she would be able to remain there. But even that she saw fade like the hues of autumn. Thus finally she lay sprawled in the filth of a garbage dump at the foot of a bridge. In the end, shattered by naughty children playing house, she became stones thrown into the blackness of night.99 94 Again a sexual interpretation is possible here. 'Tragically' in this translation is derived from a word play in the phrase mi o aemono no kao yogorenureba. Mi o ae implies the full form mi o aenaku,'. . . one tragically'. Aemono is a kind of salad. 95 Chu Mai-ch'en *Wf:, d. 109 B.C., a Han official who first earned his livelihood as a woodcutter. His wife is said to have left him when he was poor, then killed herself after meeting him years later when he was prosperous. See Han shu &amp;X, Biographies, Book 34, first half. The story is also retold in Ku chin hsiao shou tE4JbS, translated by Cyril Birch in Stories from a Ming Collection, Grove Press, New York, 1958. 96 A reference to Ukifune in Genji Mono- gatari. She attempted suicide after being unfaithful to her lover, Kaoru. She later became a nun and spent much time consoling herself with the art of calligraphy. 97 An allusion to the prose-poem Ch'ang men -AP by the Early Han poet Ssu-ma, a Hsiang-ju :,,4Htp, which tells of the sorrow of Empress Ch'en, the consort of Emperor Wu, when she lost favor with him and was banished to the Ch'ang Men Palace. See Ch'ang men fu Y, in Wen Hsiian IZ3, Chapter 16. 98 It was believed that the applying and burning of moxa on the second day of the second month would assure good health for the year. 99 An allusion to the saying yamiyo no tsubute *K(D, 'a stone thrown in the dark of night', a metaphor for an act the outcome which is unknowable.</page><page sequence="9">300 Monumenta Nipponica, XXXIV, 3 Memoirs of the Official Residence in Southern Musashi This is one of Yayui's earliest haibun, written in 1730, the year he arrived in Edo, a young official in the service of the Owari fief government. His dislike of the capital is obvious in this autobiographical vignette, where shrewd merchant types traffic in forbidden rice-cakes and sake while Yayui leads a seemingly drab existence. His little garden afforded him some consolation, but the passing daily parade of 'reciters of. . . chants, vigil beggars and proxy pilgrims', good Buddhists, and whores failed to divert him. IN the eyes of one who has come 100 ri"'0 across boundless seas and mountains, living here a year is, in its oppression, as suffocating as covering one's face with something. Yet wherever one lives from day to day, there through the window shines the moon of the capital."'0 Thus I have come to enjoy sound sleep and pleasant dreams. For my quarters I settled upon a room a spare four mats in size. I have put my personal belongings in order. In a garden of some two or three ken a cellar occupies a good half of the area. Only a little open space remained, yet there someone has planted a silver-leaf plant and two azaleas. The time for blooming has passed, yet their green leaves glisten brightly. Transplanting these smug, self-satisfied flowers here and there, and watering them in the morning and at dusk, has become a means for forgetting my own wretched existence. Cool breezes from the lush green hillsides of summer are drawn to the wind-bells hanging under the eaves. Over the cracks in the walls I affixed calligraphy plaques, and where a part of the shoji is missing I have hung a nondescript bamboo curtain. And on moonlit evenings when the curtain is rolled halfway up, my thoughts go back to the Suma residence of Yukihira'02 and I wonder if it was not something like this. Whereupon the wind rushes through the pines behind the house and I ask myself if the waves will reach this far inland [as they did in Genji Monogatari].'03 100 The traditional ri E of Japan is roughly equal to 2.5 miles. Yayu has not simply resorted to an expediently round number here; the distance between Nagoya, his home, to Edo was, in fact, only slightly less than 100 ri by way of the Tokaido. 101 A literal translation of two expressions which pivot on the word sumeba. First, kyo yo asu yo to sumeba, 'When one lives each day as it comes'; then after sumeba, there is miyako no tsuki no sashiirite, 'The moon of the capital shines where one lives,' that is, there's no place like home. This is one of several sayings with the phrase sumeba miyako, e.g., sumeba miyako no kaze ga fuku, 'The winds of the capital blow where one lives.' 102 The courtier Ariwara no Yukihira d. 893, brother of Narihira, was once banished to Suma and is mentioned in the Suma chapter of Genji Monogatari: 'Genji's new home was quite close to the place where in ancient days Ariwara no Yukihira once lived in exile "trailing his water-buckets along the lonely shore."' Arthur Waley, tr., The Tale of Genji, The Modern Library, New York, 1960, p. 241. 103 Yayu adverts to both Genji and the noh play Matsukaze *RA. The wind in the pines (matsukaze) is an allusion to the latter and consistent with his previous mention of Yukihira, the hero of the play. In Genji, Prince Genji worries during an afternoon storm that he may be inundated by the wind- driven waves, and he recalls Yukihira and a poem he wrote about the wind at Suma.</page><page sequence="10">YAYUCY: Uzurazoromo 301 The second-story window that catches the rays of the sun in the western sky is hard by the compound wall and the tops of trees thrust themselves up to obscure the view; yet between the trees Mt Fuji is in full view, and visible in the far distance are the oyster-shell roofs which rival, in their whiteness, the timeless snows of Fuji.'04 It is a rare day when there is anything spectacular about the foot traffic that passes by the house. Those who come calling are reciters of the Amidist or Nichiren chants,'05 vigil beggars,'06 and proxy pilgrims.'07 Sometimes I hear in the far distance the sound of a temple's wooden prayer drum or the clanging of monks' bells as they solicit contributions for a building fund, one of their number shoulder- ing a gilded Buddha. The 'nuns'"08 sell daytime love in Akasaka and return home at nightfall drag- ging their clogs as they walk.'09 The faces of the Ladies of the Crossroads"I0 are too white now in the early morning daylight and so they cover them with kerchiefs, and thus hold our interest for a moment, yet they cannot really move our hearts. From the house next door, on the other side of the wall, no sound is concealed from us, nor can they on the other side be ignorant either of anything we do, from the sounds of the lighting of the fire in the morning until moving fans come to quiet rest within the paper mosquito nets hanging over our beds. All sounds reach our ears, both on days when the kitchen mortar is active in anticipation of guests and on leisurely days when no guests come and there is time to chop tobacco. As the days pass one by one, my companions, too, smug expressions on their faces, plant red pepper in the poor man's sake cask"' and await the crimson au- tumn. They train their sword-bean plants to grow within reed hedges, raise the pungent, but edible, smartweed in garbage dumps, and feel no little anguish at the call of the sushi vendor. Thus do we live impecunious lives. 104 Kakigara yane tWOM, a roof made of oyster shells in place of the usual tiles, and popular during the Edo period. There is also a word play on toki which immediately precedes shiranu yuki, 'the snows which know no....' Toki means both 'time' and 'melting', thus the timeless/unmelting snows of Mt Fuji. 105 Presumably the callers were in fact beggars who solicited money on the pretext that they would recite these chants for the benefit of contributors. 106 Daimachi ft, a beggar who said prayers for money, usually at the night-long machi purification rituals such as hi machi H 4 or koshinmachi 1# @ 107 Daimairi ft* 9, beggars who, like the daimachi, undertook, or at least made a pretext of undertaking, religious pieties for a fee. The daimairi, as their name indicates, said their prayers at a temple or shrine. 108 Bikuni JtTJE, prostitutes who affected the costume of the Buddhist nun. They flourished during the first half of the Edo period. The Akasaka district was the location of a number of the homes of high-level samu- rai, and of many temples and shrines. 109 Setta 'MM, literally, 'snow treads', sandals said to have been designed by the tea master Sen no Rikyui :f#Jft, 1521-91. The historical gazetteer Edo Machizukuri Ko S PRT -D'&lt; 9 M, i, p. 320, mentions setta, also written 'SU, in connection with the bikuni. It says that setta, a sandal made of bamboo and leather, was narrow at the instep, and curved upward at the back to form a high heel. 110 Tsujigimi i?R, a class of prostitute which stood low in the elaborate hierarchy of Japanese whoredom. She was a streetwalker, often one along in years, who solicited cus- tomers on the very darkest streets and corners, usually with a kerchief obscuring her features. 111 Bimbodaru R,L 'poor man's sake cask', was a small barrel with a capacity of from one-quarter to one-half gallon.</page><page sequence="11">302 Monumenta Nipponica, XXXIV, 3 The merchants, on the other hand, are shrewd. Fully equal to the loyalty shown by Fan Li," 2 they conceal their rice-cakes underneath moxa, and in the case of sake, fraudulently write on the barrels the symbol"3 one usually finds on a miso 4 bucket, and thus manage to evade the censure of the authorities. They solicitously come around at the morning and evening meal selling boiled beans and vegetable salad, and after a rainfall, when the farmers are in their houses, they go about peddling moxabustion. How fanciful a life they lead! Thus even Ch'in Shih Huang Ti's A-Fang Palace,"5 which put the clouds themselves to shame with its magnificence, would be a nuisance and a bother if one had to clean the place, whereas a man can make his way smoothly enough through this floating world, living all the while in a snail shell that has not a single door. Whether one's home meets one's needs or not depends upon the mind of the dweller therein. Thus I do not think of myself here in Edo as being away from home. These sentiments I have inscribed upon a plaque for the amusement of those who come to visit me. On Sleeping Late Yayu proclaims himself a late-sleeper in this brief, but charming encomium to that petty vice, and at the same time gives expression to the sensibility of sabi, the essentially Japanese appreciation of the evocative power of suggestion over statement, and perfection in the imperfect. AMONGST the various teachings of Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism, from majestic governance at the highest level to the busy world of the abacus and the marketplace at the lowest, one will never find a doctrine advising men to sleep late in the morning. On the contrary, from cock's first crow does not the loyal servant, bitten by mosquitos and smoking his tobacco, count off the strokes as +U_ hP11 t,&lt;11" in' +u,' A-V1a14T 9 112 Fan Li MM, also known as T'ao Chu- kung , was an official under the Yuieh king Kou Chien 'PJR in the 5th century B.C. An exemplar of loyalty who fearlessly ad- monished his king, he once disguised himself as a fisherman and smuggled a poem of encouragement to the imprisoned king in the belly of a fish. This was in spite of the fact that the king had been captured after dis- regarding Fan Li's advice and attacking the neighboring and stronger state of Wu. Ironically, perhaps, Yayla likens the mer- chants of Edo to Fan Li for their loyalty, not their obvious cunning. Possibly the most popular Japanese source for this story in Yaylu's time was Taiheiki, Book 4, last episode. 113 Mei !, 'mark', 'inscription'. The Iwata text erroneously gives the character R, also read mei, but meaning 'inebriation'. 114 lW, a fermented soy-bean paste which is a staple of the Japanese diet.

When it was set afire after the Ch'in was overthrown, it was said to have burned for three months. To Yayui, the mighty samurai-official is to the despised peasant what the grand A-Fang Palace is architecturally to the shell of a snail. The elegant phrasing notwithstanding, we detect here a note of forlorn complaint, if not bitterness, against the rise of the social parvenu.</page><page sequence="12">YAYU: Uzuragoromo 303 Most certainly it is the beginning of financial ruin when a young son amuses himself with sex and wine, peevish of spirit and heavy of head, never knowing the blossom of the morning-glory, and delegating everything to his clerks. And so it was when the T'ang Emperor Hsiuan Tsung had his precious consort massage his hips so that he forgot even mealtimes."16 Be that as it may, with nothing to do to occupy her, an old woman will find herself criticized by her daughter-in-law in the main wing for rising early in the morning to play the Buddha game. "7 Such women would be better advised to toss about in bed while someone else gets the coals glowing in the kotatsu. I am not saying, however, that one should lie abed without carrying out his tasks. Still, from the third to the fifth month, when the nights are short and well suited to the pillow, late-sleeping is a joy indeed. One need not be sound asleep, but drowsing, whether dreaming or not. To lie in bed in one's room and imagine the morning sun shining brightly on the flowers or the moon still there in the dawn sky behind the pines-this surpasses even getting up to see these things."8 I hear the call of the bean-curd pedlar as he passes by, the sound of the wheel turning around in the well, the chirping of the sparrows who have flocked together to feed. At just this moment, when I am at complete peace with myself, I am startled by a most disagreeable voice calling at my door. When I open one of the rain shutters, the sun is high in the sky and it is past ten o'clock. The bowl of hot water ladled out by that sensible boy who serves me is now thoroughly chilled. It is a pity that his effort should have come to naught. Yet I now realize that it is perhaps better to sleep through the morning than to cleverly get up early and then find it almost impossible to keep my eyes open through the day and have to steal time to nap. And so this is the sleeping scheme that I have undertaken. Having said this, however, surely when the autumn nights lengthen and I find early rising amuses me again, I shall soon enough be called the Early-rising Man. In the meantime, I trust both Shaka and Confucius will look with forbearance upon my sleeping late. Uguisu o Yoru ni shite kiku Asane kana. I hear the nightingale And I think it's night, But I'm just sleeping late. 116 A reference to the tragic story of Emperor Hsuan Tsung ; and his beloved, but hapless, consort Yang Kuei-fei %A2. The emperor's love for her was said to have blinded him to, if not caused, the deteriorating social conditions in T'ang China. He was subsequently overthrown and the classic beauty murdered. 117 Hotoke naburi {AM 9, literally, 'Buddha teasing', a kind of mechanical offering of prayers to the Buddha, not out of sincere belief, but simply because it is one's duty. 118 The same delight in imagination over reality is expressed in Tsurezuregusa, section 137: 'And are we to look at the moon and cherry blossoms with our eyes alone? How much more evocative and pleasing it is to think about the spring, without stirring from the house, to dream of the moonlight night though we remain in our room.'

Yayu's apprecia- tion of material things, however, does not blind him to humane concerns. He looks at the old lid in terms of the people who might have used it: a recluse monk, a bitter old woman 'harassing her daughter-in-law in the smoke-filled kitchen'. The poem at the end is an interesting deviation from the usual haiku. It is a four-line qua- train, a kana-shi inspired by a Chinese form, both in structure and the use of rhyme. ONCE when I was staying in Musashi, I discovered in a run-down little shop there a lid to a small pot that the nightingale in that old poem might well have coveted. 11 9 The wooden handle has come off and only traces of the nails remain. There is a knothole large enough for the rays of the moon to pour through and it has a very old and besooted tint that is not at all unnatural. When I reflect on its deterioration, I see a recluse monk preparing in it a food offering to the Buddha, or an old woman in her rented lodgings harassing her daughter-in-law in the smoke-filled kitchen. It struck me that the sadness its owner must have felt in pawning it to stay alive exceeds even that of a person who sells mysid shrimp,120 and yet I wonder how the shopkeeper regarded me as I acquired the pot-lid now myself. There is a popular saying, 'A mortar has no lid.'121 All we have here, however, is a lid, the pot having been separated from it who knows where. I saw that to have placed it on another pot would have been a tragedy that would have brought dis- repute to its conjugal quilt,122 and pain to the lid itself. I related the story to a man who has a way with a brush and he wrote the follow- ing lines on the lid. It now hangs as a plaque in my quiet retreat: Tare zosui ni ochiba takinuru Susukeshi mukashi toedo kataezu Ware warenabe no yo o nogarenaba Yoshi tojibuta no nare to asobamu. 12 3 Who kindled fallen leaves to cook rice gruel? I ask the besooted past itself but get no answer; Were I to flee this flawed world, Then I should perforce sport with you, my mended lid. 119 An allusion to a waka in Book 1 of Fukuro no Soshi 4M , a 12th-century prosodic work by Fujiwara Kiyosuke SJ# , and in several other works as well. A child, denied the use of an earthenware vessel by his stepmother, asks a singing nightingale if it 'wants a little pot, or misses its mother a lot.' 120 An allusion to a waka by Basho: 'How much more pathetic than its buyer / Is the one who sells mysid shrimp by the measure.' The same poem has been published elsewhere with the seller and buyer reversed, that is, with the buyer as the object of pity. HonchJ Bunkan *4i:K, Book 1, &amp; Fazoku Monzen, Book 7. This transposition is generally attributed to over-zealous compilers, who doubtless felt that anyone who is reduced to buying such small fry as mysid shrimp is indeed worthy of pity. 121 Suribachi ni futa nashi, an expression used to indicate the obviousness of a situation. 122 An allusion to a poem by the priest Jakunen i (Fujiwara Yorinari OiRMA)</page><page sequence="14">YAYUY: Uzuragoromo 305 Queries for the Chrysanthemum As he does with the lowly leaffan in the first haibun in Uzuragoromo, 'In Praise of the Nara Fan', Yayu champions here simplicity over pretension, comparing the unassuming chrysanthemum growing untended with its pampered cousin who is carefully looked after in 'the households of wealth'. We can guess from this and the preceding haibun that Yayui is committed to the aesthetic virtue of artlessness in life, if not in the composition of haibun. The date of the piece is not known. THE chrysanthemum that is planted, then forgotten, grows slender of its own ac- cord and, likewise, blooms of its own accord. The red ones bloom red, and those that are to be white blossom into white chrysanthemums. However, in the house- holds of wealth, even in this day and age, they are grandly pampered. 124 They are secured in boxes, their measurements are taken with special rulers,125 and with each succeeding year they bloom anew. Were we to think of the pampered flower's coming into bloom in human terms, we should visualize the courtesan.126 She is sold to the Village of Sorrows, and becomes all the rage for a time, her name ranking with the likes of Takao and Osh-a.127 She is loved by those for whom she feels no love, and rests her head on an impermanent pillow. Was it for this a mother raised her? And was it for this the rain and dew bestowed their blessings on the chrysanthemum? In ancient days, P'eng Tsu drank chrysanthemum dew from his cup, and lived 800 years.128 When Kusunoki Masashige drew a chrysanthemum on his banner, appearing in Shinkokinsha #1964 and ad- monishing infidelity: 'Weighty enough the (g/q)uilt with one's own wife, / Lay it not on a wife not your own.' 123 This curious quatrain is structurally patterned on the four-line Chinese poetic form known as chuieh chui M'ij. Lines 1, 2, &amp; 4 rhyme, each ending with a four-syllable word, the last vowel of which is u. Thus a rhyming translation (AABA) is another possibility: 'Who kindled fallen leaves for rice-gruel nourishment? / I ask the besooted past, but it begrudges comment; / Were I, a broken pot, to flee this world, / I should perforce, my mended lid, with you take my amusement.' Yayul's use of warenabe, 'broken pot', and tojibuta, 'mended lid', suggests the saying, Warenabe ni tojibuta, 'A mended lid for a cracked pot', that is, 'Every Jack has his Jill.' 124 The cultivation of chrysanthemums is a centuries-old tradition in Japan, where genera- tions of fanciers have developed blossoms in a multitude of colors and configurations-huge corollas exceeding the breadth of a hand, blossoms in the shape of starfish, others as round as a ball, and single plants producing combinations of the above and other varieties. 125 Kanejaku R, a right-angle metal ruler commonly used by carpenters. 126 Keisei A. The term first appears in Han shu, Book 97, Part 1, but was originally an allusion to a woman of great beauty. The derived meaning of courtesan was apparently used only in Japan. 127 Takao A 9 and Oshui A)Ij were two professional names given to a number of prostitutes of some accomplishment or renown during the Edo period. 128 P'eng Tsu MH., also known as Chu Tz'u T'ung AUSI, is a legendary figure in China known for his longevity. According to Lieh hsien ch'uian chuan J'i, he was 'already over 700 years old at the end of the Yin dynasty, yet still vigorous.' Chung kuo ku tai pan hua ts'ung kan rmJ YR:490J, v, p. 3a. P'eng Tsu was probably better known to the Japanese through a somewhat different story (Taiheiki, Book 13) which tells how he was banished to Li Hsien for walking across the pillow of his patron, King Mu of the Chou dynasty. There he is said to have drunk dew from the petals of the chrysanthemum and achieved immortality.</page><page sequence="15">306 Monumenta Nipponica. xxxiv. 3 he triumphed over 100,000 mounted foe. 129 The fool will ask this longevity of the flower, and the simpleton general will envy its exploits, and yet is the heart of the flower filled with arrogance? I shall venture, my chrysanthemum, to ask these questions of you. Do you long to be stout, as are those in the homes of the rich? Are you happy being thin? Well, no matter. Even though you don't reply, I am fully aware of your feelings. And as I whispered this, the autumn breeze let the wordless flower nod its assent. Waga kiku ya Shakutorimushi no Te mo karazu. My chrysanthemums Get no help from inch worms, Much less measuring sticks. Admonitions Concerning the Nose In 'Admonitions Concerning the Nose', Yaytu renminds us that Japanese poets have traditionally eschewed the nose as a subject, but that it is not to be despised since, after all, the god who guided the god Ninigi to Japan had a huge nose, and of all the instruments of the senses, only the nose withstands the decay of age. This piece is an example of what is characterized as the farcical school of haibun. It is so categorized, however, less for its whimsical style, than because the subject of the piece, the human nose, is considered an inappropriate topic for haikai. 'Admnonitions Concerninig the Nose' wvas written in 1753 or earlier. ALTHOUGH the ears and the mouth, to say nothing of the watchful eyes,130 have continually been written of, in waka poetry they are not all that conspicuous. Why is it that the word 'nose' has survived only in the lighter haikai verse? Even in disparaging Suetsumuhana's nose,"' Prince Genji did not come right out and 129 Kusunoki Masashige 4*1Eik, 1294- 1336, the loyal military leader who fought for the southern court and Emperor Go-Daigo during the restoration movement in the early part of the 14th century. His family crest was the kikusui XA, a chrysanthemum floating on water, and this, of course, was on his banner. The victory mentioned here by Yayui was the battle of Chihaya in 1333, where a small band led by Kusunoki fought off the much larger forces of the Kamakura bakufu. While the number of mounted enemy cited by Yayui is an extraordinary figure for a cavalry force, it is only one-tenth of the figure given in Taiheiki. 130 This section begins with complicated punning and allusion, which have been omitted from the translation. It starts, shinobu no ura no miru me, a somewhat more faithful, if less comprehensible, translation of which is, 'the eyes which seaweed in the gulf of Shinobu'. Me, 'eye', also has a secondary meaning of seaweed. Miru me, 'eyes which see', is also homonymous with another word for the same kind of plant, written '4*tji. The location of the gulf of Shinobu is not known, although one scholar suggests that it may be near the city of Fukushima. Yayui's inspiration for this laboriousness is apparently Tsurezuregusa, section 20: Shinobu no ura no ama no miru me mo tokoro seku, 'Irksome, too, the watchful eyes of the women divers of Shinobu Gulf.'</page><page sequence="16">YAYfU: Uzuraroromo 307 mention it in his poem to her. Thus what a delight it is to see such drolleries in haikai verse! But that is not to say that the nose is something gross like the navel or the but- tocks. To go back to the very beginning, the august nose of the god Sarudahiko 32 was the foremost wonder of the age of the gods. Later the long-nosed tengu goblins of Mt Atago and Mt Takao"33 manifested their pride by holding high their noses, yet surely they must have been cold with no place to rest their noses134 among the cryptomeria trees. Look at what happens when people grow old. Their eyes weaken and a long veil of mist hangs over far-off mountains. Their ears likewise grow estranged from the calls of the birds and the insects. As for the mouth, teeth fall therefrom like withered winter leaves. 135 So stark is the contrast between the vigor of youth and the debility of age that it engenders feelings of sorrow in the human heart. Yet even though one be a gray-haired crone of a hundred years, 1 36 it is the nose and the nose alone that suffers no impairment, nor does it break down and fail in its function. Only the nose remains forever constant. Mayhaps we ought to style it the mountain which knows neither time nor thaw.137 At bottom, it is the self-seeking heart of man138 which terrifies us. Because from ancient times the saintly and sagacious one dealt in his teachings with only four physical aspects of man, vision, hearing, speech and movement, 1 39 and was heed- 131 Suetsumuhana *t was one of Genji's mistresses. She is depicted as an unappealing woman with a red nose, thoroughly maladroit at the polite, though vital, accomplishments of poetry and calligraphy. The waka men- tioned here appears in the Suetsumuhana chapter of Genji: 'Not a color that I fancy, / Why did I brush my sleeve against this safflower ?' The unfortunate woman's name is a pun, and also symbolizes her ugliness. Hana tE, 'flower', is homonymous with hana A, 'nose'. The suetsumuhana is a bright red flower that was used as a cosmetic. 132 rf31), said to be a fearsome-looking god with a nose seven spans in length. He appears in Kojiki, Book 1, and Nihon Shoki, Book 2, as the deity who guided the god Ninigi to Japan. 1 Atagosan &amp;al and Takaosan AO[4j, two hills in northwestern Kyoto once thought to be the home of tengu XJ4], imaginary creatures of a more or less anthropomorphic form who have long noses and the power of flight. 134 Tsuyujimo no okidokoro nakute ika ni samukaramu. Tsuyujimo no Rgo, 'dew- frost's', not translated, caps okidokoro, 'a place to rest it'. The phrase pivots on ok(u), which means both 'to place' and 'to form', as in 'the dew forms'. Samu(ki), 'cold', is an engo, or associative word, in this context. 135 A simple pun on tooth and leaf, both ha. 136 Momotose no tsukumogami danii -D -c &lt; K - L 1t .

Most of the mistresses and young lads who pride themselves on their receiving the patronage of their masters haughtily flaunt this patronage140 and turn up their noses at uncongenial associates, and thus they make costly mistakes, having, as the saying goes, looked down one's nose at something just because it is one's specialty. 14 The nose is all the more important when we are considering remonstrances against love, where one can be captivated simply by a fragrance that one would have difficulty even describing. We know from instances in the past that a great, long-snouted elephant can be held secure with the plaited strands of a woman's hair,'42 and that a dayfly can be caught in the hairs that a fool grows in his nostrils.143 They say that disaster begins right at home,144 so we ought to be especially wary about what lies immediately under our noses. An Explication on Tobacco 'An Explication on Tobacco' enumerates the virtues of one of life's mundane, if noxious, sensualpleasures, almost obscuring, at the same time, its topicalsimplicity in a dense cloud of literary and historical allusion. Smoking seems to have been popular in Japan in spite of attempts by the Tokugawa government to suppress it as a social debilitant. Yayi7 wrote the piece in 1745. You may get drowsy journeying along a road at night, but you cannot have a teapot dangling from your waist to refresh yourself. You may wake up one autumn day downcast, but you cannot feed yourself if you cannot reach the rice-cakes on the shelf. Surely it is only the companionship that tobacco affords in such situations that surpasses the three pleasures of harp, poetry, and wine.145 It well may be that Tsai Yu looked for a firebrand in the kitchen stove so that he might light up after his afternoon nap,146 and that the Lesser Chamberlain craned 140 Aruji o hana ni kakete, literally, 'to wear the master on one's nose.' 141 Ete ni hana tsuku, literally, 'to poke at one' s specialty with one's nose.' This can be compared with, 'Good swimmers are most drowned.' 142 Onna no yoreru kamisuji ni wa hana no takaki daizo mo tsunagare. Save for the mention of a long trunk (translated here as 'long-snouted' to preserve the nasal imagery), Yayfu took this from Tsurezuregusa, but its provenance is the 4th-century Buddhist canon Wu ku chang chii chin H*fAJ, although the hair is not identified there as a woman's. 143 Aho no nobaseru hanage ni wa, an allusion to a popular saying, Aho no hanage de kagero o tsunagu, 'To tie up a dayfly with the hair in a fool's nostrils.'

How free a feeling it must be! Ever since lacquered burlap tobacco trays150 were provided for each person in the homes of the august, it has become a not unpleasant fashion to put cigarette holders in teahouse waiting rooms, yet, as is to be expected, one wastes a good deal of time with the customary bows and salutations. Yet when a man briefly stops his palanquin in the shade of a wind-buffeted pine to assemble his two-piece pipe, the mistress of the teahouse will have the good sense to provide a straw-fed flame on an abalone shell, an act which brings to mind the adage that one gourd is worth a thousand gold-pieces when one is drowning. 151 And surely the joy of lighting a pipe with a puff from the bowl of the fellow working a field and asking-under a serene sky wherein skylarks call out in flight- where to catch the ferry to get to one's destination surpasses the happiness of the hungry Han Hsin when he was fed by the washerwoman. 152 The virtues of tobacco have been well catalogued since ancient times, and to state them again would be to belabor the obvious.

Yayui's metaphor is hyperbolic, but com- pared to an unwieldly flint that would be practically unusable on a windy day, a straw- fed flame would certainly be a godsend to a smoker. 152 This story is related in Shih chi PE, Book 92. Han Hsin Or, unable to find work or food, was fishing one day when he was noticed by a woman washing silk in the river. She took pity on him and fed him. See Burton Watson, tr., Records of the Grand Historian of China, Columbia U.P., 1961, I, p. 208. 153 Yayui is alluding to a line in the brief essay, !k9jA, by the Sung Confucianist Chou Mao-shu )Ji,: 'In my opinion the chrysan- themum is the eremite of flowers; the peony is the plutocrat of flowers; the lotus is the gentleman of flowers.' Kobun Shimpo Kosha Shinshaku r Kodokan, 1929, p. 126.</page><page sequence="19">310 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxiv, 3 pleasures according to their merits :154 sake is the plutocratic one, tea is the eremi- tic, and tobacco, at least for the moment, is akin to the Confucian gentleman. When put to use it envelops those around it in clouds, and when it is withdrawn from service, it hides itself in the folds of the sleeve. We might even say that these are the machinations of the Sacred Dragon."15 Ghosts and teetotalers, they say, have vanished from this world,'56 yet there remain still a goodly number of teetotalers. It is the tobacco-hater that is a rarity now. People smoke on the plains and they smoke in the mountains, and the elegant fashioning of tobacco cases flourishes more with the passing of each day, and tastes in pipes are new each year; all of this bedazzles the senses of the young men. And yet it occurs to me after reading the wall decrees of the house of Kusunoki on Mt Kongo157 that the most important thing is that the tobacco leaf not dry out,158 and that nothing is more important than a pipe which draws well and an ash pot which doesn't tip over. Thus within the human heart, that flower whose colors fade unseen, 159 we must not, I think, lose the essence, the true significance of these things. 154 Shinasadame rJMb semu ni, an allusion to Genji and his companions amusing them- selves one rainy night by evaluating and categorizing women, which Murasaki called the amayo no shinasadame, 'evaluations on a rainy night'. This famous passage is found in the Yfigao chapter of Genji. 155 Shinryu 4FjIk, the king of the dragons. In popular Buddhist mythology the dragon is the tutelary spirit in lakes, rivers, and oceans, and also the dispenser of rain. Thus Yayfu likens tobacco to the dragon since it, too, produces 'clouds'. 156 Geko to bakemono wa yo ni sutarete, re- lated to the popular saying, Geko to bakemono wa nai, 'There are no ghosts nor teetotalers,' that is, everyone drinks at least a little bit. 157 A reference to the internal rules of the house of Kusunoki Masashige (see n. 129, above). Yayfu is not concerned with content here, however, but mimics the homiletic style of the rules, which appear in Book 76 of Matsuura Kiyoshi's *Ajim Kasshi Yawa FP- -Wt, a 19th-century chronicle of warrior- class life. Kusunoki's family home was a castle-fortification on Kong6san in Kawachi. 158 Hasaganu, the negative attributive form of hasagu, used in the Nagoya area to mean 'dry out'. 159 An allusion to a well-known waka by Ono no Komachi 'iJ'%iJ'JT in Kokinshu #797, in which the fading flower is a metaphor for the capriciousness of the human heart: 'That which fades, hue unseen, / Is the flower that is the human heart.'</page></plain_text>
