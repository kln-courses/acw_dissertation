Bull Edgar Krentz Drew University Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago Madison, NJ 07940 Chicago, IL 60615 Olin J. Storvick Concordia College Moorhead, MN 56560 INTRODUCTION Caesarea Mar?tima, the capital of Roman and Byzantine Palestine, lies on the east ern littoral of the Mediterranean Sea about halfway between modern Tel Aviv and Haifa (fig. 1). Erected by Herod the Great between 22 and 10 b.c., it was the center of Roman and Byzantine government and the main port of entry into Palestine from its construction until the Islamic conquest in A.D. 640. Flavius Josephus gives a detailed description of the construction of the seaport and the city, a description that suggests its magnitude and sumptuous character (JW 1: 408-15). The Joint Expedition to Caesarea Maritima1 has been excavating at Caesarea since 1971, and reports of earlier seasons are included in the bib liography. The ninth season of excavation (27 May to 29 July 1980) concentrated on two fields opened in earlier seasons. Field C lies just south of the Crusader Fortress, north of the theater excavated by the Italian Mission, and west of a north-south street of the Byzantine era; Field G lies to the north of the Crusader Fortress, but south of the massive wall excavated by the Italian Mission in 1959-62. It is on either side of a Byzantine street first excavated in Area 4 in 1976 (fig. 2). A major objective of the Joint Expedition has been the recovery and clarification of the city plan of the Roman and Byzantine city. For that reason areas were laid out along the streets in relation to significant structures discovered earlier. Another objective is the recovery of the cultural history of the site, based on excavated strata and the asso ciated material remains. The ninth season made significant contributions toward achieving both objectives (Bull 1981). The present report uses the phasing system proposed for Caesarea Mar?tima byL. E. Toombs(1978). FIELD C The Joint Expedition has worked in Field C in every season since 1971. The most significant finds of earlier seasons included a major north-south street (though not the cardo maximus) of the Byzantine period, four east-west decumani (Wiem ken and Holum 1981: 24, fig. 1), a series of under ground vaults that served as harbor warehouses already in the Roman period (one converted to a Mithraeum in Late Roman; Bull 1974a, 1982: 34-38, with plates; Hopfe and Lease 1975), and a large Byzantine public building, first explored by Avraham Negev in 1960 and excavated by the Joint Expedition from 1972 to 1974. Study ofthat building continues. Above the harbor vaults are extensive remains of Roman and Byzantine struc tures in several phases. Just below the surface lies a later Islamic and Crusader cemetery. Field C was marked off as a single insula by the work in 1979; it is bounded by the cardo to the 31</page><page sequence="2">32 BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 Fig. 1.

Seven areas, laid out in the 10-meter grid, were excavated in 1980 (figs. 3, 4). Area 21, partially excavated in 1978, was continued; it lies along the modern tourist road close to the sea. It is a part of the apsidal building found by Negev in 1960. Area 25 lay at the highest point of the field, just west of Area 22 in which a large (partially destroyed) figurai mosaic of the Middle or Late Bronze period was found in 1978. Beneath it lay the southeastern corner of the Honorific Esplanade first excavated in 1973. Area 26 lies just east of that Honorific Explanade; it was discovered in Area 19 in 1976. Area 27 lies along the modern access road, east of Areas 20, 19, 21, 15, and 14, all of which relate in some manner to an apsidal structure. This area is just west of the Byzantine Public Record Build ing. Area 28 lay over the farthest known extent of the vault system, and was discovered by crawl ing through the complex of vaults that begins in Area 17 and lies along the sea (explored in 1979). Areas 29 and 30 were laid out over and just west of the cardo discovered in 1974. The main objec tive in these two areas was to date the street accurately and understand what lay just west of it.</page><page sequence="5">1986 CAESAREA MAR?TIMA: NINTH SEASON, 1980 35</page><page sequence="6">BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 Fig. 5. Field C, Area 25, final top plan. Phase 7, Roman (10B.c. to ad. 330) The Hellenistic Period is represented only by occasional random sherds. According to the ex cavation record, the occupational history of Field C begins in the Roman period (fig. 5). Three major discoveries were made. Roof tile, laid over hydrau lic concrete (Locus 25084) in association with Wall 25085 (faced on its northern or inner face with hydraulic concrete) and Wall 25086 (faced in the same manner) showed that the Honorific Esplanade is, according to present knowledge, a U-shaped building, with the long base running north-south and the arms extending east-west. The southern arm survives for some 15.40 m, but is broken off by later disturbance just west of Wall 25076. (The northern arm, excavated in 1973 and 1974, extends some 19.10 m and apparently survives to its full extent.) No evidence survives that the two arms were ever closed by a fourth side to form an enclosed area. Area 25 thus "completes" our knowl edge of this structure.</page><page sequence="7">1986 CAESAREA MAR?TIMA: NINTH SEASON, 1980 37 Fig. 6. Field C, Area 26, final top plan. Area 18, excavated in 1976, lay over part of the "base" of this U-shaped structure. It was clear, then, that there was a structure to the east. Area 26 contained impressive remains of an unusual installation (fig. 6). Mosaic Pavement 26110 (set in a bedding of hydraulic cement, 26112) led from the U-shaped structure to a small building with a heavy mosaic floor (26091 and 26103) laid in a strong matrix. The mosaic floor was a single floor over which a later structure was built. Four steps (or benches) rose on three sides of the building (Loci 26108, 26074, and 26076). The building was roughly 7.00 m2 and was bounded on the fourth side by Heavy Wall 26036. That wall was set in deep foundations; the fill in Locus 26094 to the east contained largely Roman pottery. The build ing probably was unroofed; it may have served as a meeting place (a small bouleterionl), related to the U-shaped structure to the west. A covered water channel (26066) ran along the south side of</page><page sequence="8">38 BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 buildings not fundamentally altered or replaced were the massive storage vaults (horrea), of which fig. 8 provides an example. A rectilinear building (Walls 21033 and 21102) with a magnificent mosaic floor (21021, 21088) was built north of the vaults in the Byzantine era (it is not clear if an earlier vault stood there). It was rebuilt dramatically when the floor was cut by Apse 21020, Piers 21099 and 21116, and Wall 21032, which formed the east wall for Staircase 21069. Locus 21137, under the floor, contained two ten-nummia coins from after a.D. 527, along with some Middle Byzantine sherds. At the same time a new small structure was built inside the Roman stepped meeting room in Area 26 (fig. 9; cf. fig. 6). Bounded by Walls 26087 and 26068 and by Apse 26089 built into Wall 26036, it was reached by New Steps 26097. It was founded on the earlier Roman floor. Cross-Wall 26098 formed a pool into which water was brought by a conduit from Channel 26066; part of the eastern end of Steps 26076 was destroyed in the construction. The building appears to have been a small nymphaeum or public water fountain of the Middle Byzantine period. It was richly decorated with a polychrome fresco, fragments of which were found throughout the debris. The building was in use at the same time as a sumptuous Middle Byzantine structure built over the vaults; traces have been found in Areas 26, 18, 25, 16, and 17. The U-shaped structure was covered with a thick layer of humra to provide a firm foundation and a series of rooms was built over it. Although later destruction made it impos sible to recover the plan, some idea of its luxury can be gleaned from the magnificent mosaic and opus sectile floors in it. Figurai Mosaic 25072 (fig. 5) was first discovered in Area 22 in 1978; this season another figure was discovered in Area 25, a polychromatic representation of spring (fig. 10). The workmanship is outstanding. (The entire mosaic is being prepared for publication by Marie Spiro.) The quality of the work suggests that the building was a major public structure; its prox imity to the harbor supports the suggestion. Phase 6a, Late Byzantine (aj&gt;. 550-640) Extensive rebuilding occurred again in the late Byzantine period. Apse 21020 destroyed the Mid dle Byzantine floor as it was built in Area 21 (fig. 8). Drain 25087 was built through the season's mosaic in Area 25 (fig. 5), and extensive rebuilding can also be seen in Area 26. Mosaic Floor 26014 *" &gt; ^a%?a?m Fig. 7. Field C, Area 27, Locus 27047.

The channel did not bring water into the stepped structure (although the later Byzantine reconstruction did). It probably was not an impluvium for a building around it, nor was it an ornamental reflecting pool. At about the same time a massive east-west wall was constructed to the north (27016), parallel to a wall uncovered earlier in Areas 11 and 12. Fill thrown between these walls to create a massive retaining buttress contained only Roman pottery. At the same time a heavy pavement was laid at a lower level (27039) to form an east-west walkway or perhaps a narrow street. Small shops appear to have bordered it on the north; these were only partially explored. A small plaster installation lay beside it on the south side, but its function was unclear (fig. 7). The amphora beside it is Roman. Slight evidence was found in Area 30 of an earlier Roman cardo beneath the Byzantine pavers, suggesting that the Byzantine city was laid out on the earlier Roman street grid. Phases 6c and 6b, Early and Middle Byzantine (a.D. 330 to a.D. 550) There is massive evidence for a rebuilding of the insula (Field C) in the Byzantine period.

It extended to the north (fig. 6), and is apparent in the left (north) balk in fig. 9; it is seen in the south balk (Locus 26010) above its matrix (Locus 26028) in fig. 11. It cov ered a large open agora or forum of immense size. Its full extent is unknown because of destruction caused by the later burial phase, but evidence of it has been found also in Areas 18, 12, and 11. Wall 26036 was apparently its eastern boundary, since Area 29 contained part of a large cistern con temporary with it to the east (fig. 12). Entry into the southeastern vault (Vault 9) of the surviving complex in Area 28 (fig. 13) gave access to a large, uncompleted Byzantine fresco (fig. 14). Unfortunately, there was not sufficient time to remove the entire scree pile to date the vault and study the fresco; the process was com plicated by the collapse of the street entry centuries ago. It has 13 figures in all, with a very frag mentary Greek inscription. The unfinished state</page><page sequence="11">1986 CAESAREA MAR?TIMA: NINTH SEASON, 1980 41 Fig. 13.

Field C, Area 26, plate mail. Photo credit: Mike Johnson. Fig. 15. Byzantine lamp, Field C, Area 21. Drawing by Robert C. Sutton. suggests that it was begun shortly before the Islamic conquest of A.D. 640. The vault itself was clearly older, as Tesselated Floors 280046, 28050, and 28057 (all fragmentary) from the structures over the vault suggested a long period of use. Secure dating is not possible at present. In the very latest Byzantine phase (Toombs 1978: 231, dates a.D. 614-40) a potter was active in Area 21 (and in Area 19). Quantities of whole and fragmentary vessels, especially local amphorae, as well as the presence of significant quantities of Late Roman import finewares, suggested an active workshop. One anthropomorphic lamp from this workshop (fig. 15) was probably a local product. Phases 4-1, Islamic, Crusader, Modern (aj&gt;. 640-Present) The phases after the Islamic conquest are joined together in this report. Field C was in use as a Fig. 17.

Graves were either pit burials dug into the sand or simple cist burials, in which the cists were walled and capped with flat stones, but not floored. Crusader and Islamic burials could be distin guished only by skeletal position. Crusaders were buried prone, feet to the east, with arms crossed and with head elevated facing east; Islamic burials were oriented to the southeast, with bodies slightly flexed. Two burials deserve specific mention. In Area 26 a woman (!) was buried with plate mail (fig. 16). The posture suggests a Crusader burial. Another Crusader, found in Area 25 (fig. 17), raises an interesting speculation. His skull was partly cov ered by the parietal bones of another skull caus ing the eyes of the Crusader to be covered. It is tempting to suggest that he had in some way offended the standards of the community, so that the "mourners" sought to prevent his participation in the vision of the resurrection. In the modern period, as much of Field C as was usable was put under cultivation. FIELD G Four Areas were excavated in Field G in 1980 (figs. 18, 19). Area 8 was laid against the exterior</page><page sequence="14">44 BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 Fig. 19. Field G, composite plan.</page><page sequence="15">1986 CAESAREA MAR?TIMA: NINTH SEASON, 1980 45 face of the city wall, as far south as possible. Excavation was begun in 1978 and completed in 1980. The purpose was to test the occupation history outside the wall and to obtain stratified dating evidence for the wall. A small probe was dug in Area 11 on the inner face of the wall, but excavation did not proceed far enough to allow major conclusions. Area 7, also begun in 1978, is immediately contiguous to Area 6; it contained domestic architecture. The objective in 1980 was to clarify the relationship to the structures in Area 6 and to complete the excavation of Area 7. In 1978 a peristyle building with a large mosaic was found in Area 5; Area 9 was placed immediately east of Area 5 to learn more about that structure and mosaic. Area 10 was placed 20.00 m south of Area 7, on the same line as Areas 5, 6, and 7. It was immediately south of the trench from the Negev excavations. Phase 8, Hellenistic (330-10 b.c.) Some soil loci in the lower elevations of Areas 7 and 8 contained significant quantities of Hellenistic pottery. However, no structures have been found that can be dated to this phase. Phase 7, Roman Phase 7c, Early Roman (10 b.c.-a.d. 100). Sig nificant numbers of early Roman sherds were found in Area 7; but no structure can be dated with certainty to this phase. The chief surviving early Roman structure was the major City Wall 8001. About 9.00 m of the wall was excavated to its foundation course and below (fig. 20). Sherds from beneath the wall dated to the early Roman period. The wall was founded on moist virgin sand at 1.65 m above sea level. It consisted of six courses and was constructed of bossed, edge-drafted limestone blocks laid in a header-stretcher pattern on a foundation of four ashlar courses packed in humra (figs. 21, 22). The foundation courses extended 0.35 m to 0.75 m beyond the vertical face of the wall. The first step out of the foundation course varied from 0.20 m to 0.40 m beyond the face of the wall. At the south end of the wall in Area 8 the foundation courses had a single step-out, the bottom of which was at a depth of 1.54 m above sea level. In a probe between two piers, 8083 and 8084, just north of Area 8 (fig. 21) the foundation courses were Fig. 20. Field G, Area 8, elevation of Roman wall. discovered not to vary by more than 0.04 m. The main wall, which contained a rubble core, was 2.30 m in width (fig. 21). The stones of the wall were dry-laid and averaged about 1.10 m X 0.57 m X 0.32 m in size. The only interruption in the wall's header stretcher pattern occurred in the fourth course above the foundation (fig. 22), where there was a single instance of two headers without a stretcher. This irregularity seems to have been caused by the exceptional length of the stretcher immediately above. The drafting of the upper courses was apparently removed in connection with early Byzantine construction. The (present) top course of the wall is a series of headers (Locus 8045), which appear to be part of the original construc tion, designed to protect the rubble core. Locus 8045 was part of the wall at least by the Early Byzantine period, since Piers 8083 and 8084 were cemented to the header course, as well as to the top three header-stretcher courses (cf. fig. 21). After contruction, layers of sand were backfilled against the wall to cover the foundation courses. The ceramic and archaeological evidence suggested that the wall was built under Herod as part of Herodian Caesarea. The ceramic evidence has been presented in convincing detail by the supervisor responsible for the excavation of Area 8 and should be consulted for supporting detail (Blakely, 1984).

Area 6 were stratigraphically excavated to aid in determining the connection between structures in the two areas. Early in Phase 7b, Wall 7141 and Wall 6049?its northern extension in Area 6, which ran along the east side of both areas on a line slightly out of parallel to the north-south grid line?was constructed (fig. 23). Wall 6032 was found in 1978 in Area 6; it is parallel to 6049 and is believed to extend south into the unexcavated portion of Area 7. This extension of Wall 6032 would run parallel to Wall 7141. The east-west walls connecting these two are 6021, excavated in 1978 in Area 6, and 7060. Later in Phase 7b, Walls 7035 and 7142 (fig. 23) were constructed and par tially enclosed an exterior courtyard. In the corner of this courtyard, Tab?n 7129 was found. The courtyard was served by a drain, 7059, 7134, 7098, the southern sidewall of which rested against Wall 7060. Another similar surface, 7052, extended south of Wall 7060. The pottery beneath these surfaces was consistently Middle Roman at the latest, and this, together with the numismatic evidence, is the basis for assigning this domestic complex to the Middle Roman phase. East-West Walls 9010 and 9015 (fig. 24) in Area 9 were also in use during this phase since the pottery from the soil locus below Surface 9028 (which abuts the two walls) contains no pottery later than Middle Roman. Locus 9088 (fig. 24) was found approximately 1.5 m below the section of Locus 9028, which was situated between the two walls 9010 and 9015 (Thackeray et ai, trans. 1926-65). Trench 8125 lay against Wall 8001 in Area 8. It first appeared to be a foundation trench for Wall 8001, but excavation showed that it did not reach to the foundation of the wall. Therefore, it must have been dug in connection with some repair of the wall during the Middle Roman period (as the pottery evidence from the trench suggests). One can only speculate about the exact purpose of the repair. The major construction in the Middle Roman period was the building of Wall 8024 abutting Wall 8001 on the east (fig. 22). The six courses of ashlar masonry were made of stones about 0.50 m x 0.72 m x 0.27 m; in the interior of the wall they were bonded by red humra. The pottery in the foundation trench dated the structure to the Middle Roman period. The only associated surface of this period, 8127, was a thin layer of humra and pottery; further excavation to the east is needed to understand this and to determine the purpose of the wall.</page><page sequence="18">BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 SCALE ^^^ METERS 0 I 2 Fig. 23.

The evidence from Area 7 suggested that the courtyard was roofed. The surface that covered Drain 7059, 7134, 7098 also covered Tab?n 7129. In the south of the area, east-west Wall 7143 was built together with Cobbled Surface 7118 just north of it; this lay above Surface 7122. Drain 7069, constructed south of Wall 7143, put out of use the earlier Drain 7057. Circular Basin 7034 was cut into the sandstone bedrock, probably to accept a storage vessel. It should probably be associated with Tab?n 7064/7121 and with a sec ond Tab?n, 7123, to the west. Bedrock was appar ently exposed south of Drain 7057 in this period. There was only minimal evidence of activity in Area 10 during this period. Four worked stones? 10083, shown in fig. 27; fig. 26 shows only the southern two stones, since the northern two were</page><page sequence="20">50 BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 Fig. 25.

The pottery from beneath these stones was late Roman. There was no other evidence for the structure from which they came, since the construction of a major drain age system in the Late Byzantine period destroyed all earlier materials. Walls 9010 and 9015 continued in use in this period in Area 9 (fig. 24). The soil layers between these walls contained Late Roman pottery. Wall 9011 (running east-west along the south balk) belonged to this phase, since Layer 9047 (not shown on plan), which touched it and Wall 9015, contained pottery of this period. Massive Wall 9077 along the east balk ran north-south for almost 4.00 m. It appeared to have the same func tion as Wall 9031 on the west side of Street 9029; but since excavation did not proceed to the found ing courses, no definite assignment could be made. Phase 6, Byzantine Phase 6c, Early Byzantine (a.D. 330-450). No new information was gained about this phase in Area 7. It was learned in 1978 that the construction of Drain 7069 put Tab?n 7064/7121 out of use, and that Drain 7039 (below Locus 7030) was con structed between Walls 7060 and 7143 in this period. No new structures could be assigned to this phase in Area 9. Occupational levels indicated con tinued utilization of existing structures. The major construction activity in Area 8 in this period was the building of a series of piers against the outer face of Wall 8001. These piers (8083 and 8084) were strongly attached to the outer face of Wall 8001 by concrete laid against the upper three header-stretcher courses and the top header course. The piers were located at regu lar intervals along the outer face of Wall 8001. Since only one of the series was examined in detail, it is not possible to determine their specific function (fig. 21). Phase 6b, Middle Byzantine (a.D. 450-550). Occupational levels with Middle Byzantine pottery showed that existing structures were used in this period. However, the major new structure of this phase was Street 9029, which extended north south through the 8 meters of the square. Curb stones (9029, figs. 24 and 25) were preserved on the west, along with a heavy plaster between the curbing and Wall 9031. Curbstones were preserved</page><page sequence="21">1986 CAESAREA MAR?TIMA: NINTH SEASON, 1980 51 on the east side for about 3.00 m. The street pavers were laid perpendicular to the axis of the street; their average size was 0.68 m x 0.34 m x 0.10 m thick. The street sloped from an elevation of 7.98 m in the south to 7.60 m in the north. It had a reverse crown; that is, the center of the street was depressed so that it was lower than the sides of the road and the curbstones. One row of pavers was removed to obtain a sealed deposit, the pot tery from which was Middle Byzantine. Excava tion continued for nearly 2 meters below street level, but no earlier street or drain was discovered. The location of the street on which the earlier structures on the west must have faced thus re mains unknown. Street 9029 lay halfway between North-South Street III?which in Roman times must have pas sed through the two round towers of the city defense wall to the north (cf. fig. 19)?and North South Street II?which was the northern extension of the North-South Street II in Field C, Areas 13, 23, 24, and 30 and which would have passed close to the site of Avi-Yonah's synagogue excavation. Street 9029 was smaller than Street II in Field C, but this might be expected of a street that lay between two major thoroughfares. Street 9029 lined up with the pavers found in Area 4 (fig. 19) in 1976 and other pavers, visible on the surface between Area 4 and the north wall. However, the pavers to the north were cut from mizzi (hard limestone), and were dated to the Late Byzantine period. The southern extension of this street was sought in Area 10. Nothing was found in the excavated area, but a row of mizzi pavers can be seen in the east balk (fig. 27) at an elevation of 9.03 m. Other features in Area 10 suggest that they should be dated to the Late Byzantine period. In Area 12, just east of Area 7, a probe was placed between Areas 9 and 10. Herringbone-patterned pavers were found there, at an elevation of 9.12 m. Excava tion did not proceed far enough to allow the assignment of these pavers to any phase, but their location and elevation fit the street excavated else where. A curved drain was found west of these pavers in Area 12. Phase 6a, Late Byzantine (a.D. 550-640). This period was widely represented in Field G. A major north-south drain in Area 10, laid into bedrock and extending the length of the area, came from this period (figs. 26, 27). It was about 0.60 m wide. Subsidiary drains feeding from the east and the west joined it at both north and south ends of the area. In addition, a small north-flowing drain paralleled this main drain. Both construction tech nique and contents support assigning the drain to the Late Byzantine period. The drain was capped with flat stones, except at the south balk, where two pairs of curved stones provided a vaulted cover. No street was found overlying this major drain, although one anticipates its presence. Two rows of pavers were present in the east balk; these must have been remnants of streets. The upper course was of mizzi, the lower of softer limestone. Two concentrations of flat stones associated with the upper row of pavers probably came from a courtyard, not from the street itself. Street 9029 continued in use (Area 9) and was covered with successive layers of plaster. Curb stones were removed in the northeast corner of the area to make possible the construction of a manhole and a drain that sloped to the north. On the west side of the square a short wall (9074) extended south from the north balk toward Wall 9010 (whose upper course was narrower than the lower courses). The walls seemed to form a door way, and were associated with surface 9019. Frag ments of plaster surfacing and tesselation at the same approximate elevation (8.82 m) are to be associated with Walls 9010 and 9015, indicating that these structures were occupied during the period. A small area of tesselation in the southeast corner of the square could not be associated with any structure. Thirteen burials were found in Area 9. Most were without dating evidence, and cannot, there fore, be assigned to any phase. But one had a lamp of this period and a metal bracelet on the wrist. These burials followed the usual practice of north-south orientation (found only in adjacent Area 5 thus far in our excavations). In general, it should be noted that the layer below the humus layer in Field G (the second layer down) contained great quantities of pottery from the Late Byzantine period, which suggests a highly concentrated occupation. No new structures of this period were found in Area 8. Phase 5, Latest Byzantine (a.D. 614-640) No structures could be assigned to this period, either for their construction or their destruction.</page><page sequence="22">52 BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 1100051 SCALE ruf o Fig. 26. Field G, Area 10, final top plan. In Area 10 a heavy concentration of smashed Late Byzantine pottery adjacent to the east balk and above the mizzi Pavers 10009 (not shown on final top plan) seemed to be the latest Byzantine pottery in the area. Phase 4, Byzantine-Islamic (ca.

The pottery beneath this surface (the earliest of a series of later layers in Area 10) was pre dominantly Late Byzantine; it also produced three coins of the early 7th century. However, occasional Islamic sherds suggest assigning the surface to this phase. Phase3, Islamic (ad. 640-1200) Numerous plaster layers in Area 10 sealed sig nificant collections of Islamic pottery that can be assigned to specific subphases. However, no struc tures were associated with any of these surfaces; their chief interest therefore lies in the stratified Islamic pottery corpus, the first found in Field G. It is not clear if these layers were related to the course of the earlier street, which ran either through the square or just to the east, or if they served some other purpose. The surviving area of each was smaller than Surface 10041. Fig. 29. Field G, Area 8, imported two-handled cup. Drawing by Laurie J. Tiede. No significant Crusader or post-Crusader re mains were found in Field G. Although this short report cannot call to atten tion all the significant artifacts recovered in Field G, two distinctive lamps (fig. 28) and a restored cup (fig. 29) are shown. Figure 28 (#1) is a round, nozzled lamp (from Field G, Area 8, occupational debris, Locus 8042 and associated with Wall 8001), with a potter's stamp C.TAM. in plante pedis.

The potter was probably Italian and the lamp is to be added to</page><page sequence="24">54 BULL, KRENTZ, AND STORVICK SUPPLEMENT 24 the small corpus of his known work. The cup (from Field G, Area 8, Locus 8042), is according to Blakeley, Glanzman, and Tiede (in press) with out parallel in either fabric or form among the lamps previously excavated at Caesarea. It is of the type known as Italian thin-walled ware and is composed of fine pale gray clay with a vitreous dark gray slip covering the entire piece except for the exterior base. Based on comparisons with exact parallels in form and decorative matches, Tiede confidently assigns a date of 40 to 90 a.d. for the cup, probably more toward the latter de cades of this period but not later than the reign of Trajan. A round, handleless lamp (fig. 28, #2, from Field G, Area 9, Locus 9005), judged to be from the Late Byzantine period, is without parallel among the lamps excavated thus far at Caesarea.
