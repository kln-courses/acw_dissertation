<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEMIOLOGY OF LAW ANTHONY BECK* INTRODUCTION There is an implicit claim in Professor Jackson's Semiotics and Legal Theoty. It is that through French semiotics he has discovered the legal philosopher's stone: semiotics will turn the law's rhetoric, image and ideology into the law's truth. The book is an important achievement and as a pioneering work raises more questions than it answers. The structure of the book outwardly follows a straightforward plan: first, revealing the magic of semiology; second, applying it earnestly to bring out the deficiencies in the work of HIlart, MacCormick, Kelsen and Dworkin; and, finally, in a preliminary way, revealing the true metal of a semiological theory of law. Some of the book's serious deficiencies are the effects of undertaking so much within 310 pages of text. For within this plan things go somewhat wrong, partly through the lack of clarity of exposition, partly through the absence of a cogent inner argument. Semiology (or semiotics) was defined by the founder of the modern semiotic movement, Saussure, as 'the science that studies the life of signs within society'. Semiology, he believed, would show what constitutes signs and what laws govern them.2 Linguistics was only a part of this general science. Semiology would discover the laws applicable to the signs employed in language and to the signs in social life more generally. He expected that the semiotic study of social life, including myths, rituals and customs, would shed new light on social facts and demonstrate their controlling semiotic laws. The subsequent fate of semiology is extremely complex.3 Essentially, Saussure's analysis of language in terms of interacting structures which generate meaning has become the model for an explication of social and cultural phenomena as kinds of communication. In other words, the linguistic model became a general social model. In addition, a Marxist tendency, the critique of ideology, has incorporated semiological ideas in uncovering the working of social power in distorting communication.4 *lHead of Department in Law, Ealing College of Higher Education.

First, the economic, ecological or political conditions which give rise to semiological phenomena, to the production of signs, are not themselves signs. This creates a problem for semiology. Should it stop short at the very point at which general social laws can be discovered? Or should it confess its limitations and accept the role of limited heuristic tool within a broader social scientific methodology? Even if the discovery of social laws is unattempted, the problem still remains of how to deal with non-semiological material, especially in theorizing about so complex a social phenomenon as law. There are two difficulties. First, a theory of signs, and every theory of law, must give some account of interpretation. If this account includes a theory of cognition of a relatively formal kind, that is avoiding any attempt at a full psychological account, one is beset with doubts as to whether cognition can be accounted for entirely through semiology. Are there not processes of argument and evalu- ation which simply cannot be reduced to systems of signs and their underlying codes? Second, practical social conduct is not exhaustively described by semiology.' Revolution or tyranny, domination or participation, cannot ade- quately be theorized about only in terms of signs. The second major problem is this: how is any order which is called ideological different from one which is scientific?s There is substantial debate extant on this second issue. Unfor- tunately, none of these issues are confronted by Jackson. Nor is there a general hermeneutic dimension, a concern for the fact that signs are situated in history when they are created and that interpretation is also determined by historical situation. Jackson's introduction to semiology does lack concern for or interest in some of the most fascinating current debates. It is also unsuitable for the uninitiated who should first read Saussure.6 However, not least of the services which Jackson does perform is an enthusiastic account of contemporary work in legal semiology across Europe. The book concentrates in particular upon the work of the celebrated French scholar A. J. Greimas, and in particular upon a study which Greimas made with E. Landowski of a specific portion of French Civil Law. It is worth looking in some detail at precisely what Greimas and Landowski provided by way of semiological analysis, both to observe its claims and also its limitations. It must be said, however, that Professor Jackson's own contributions to legal semiology at the end of the book are quite different from Greimas and Landowski's position and potentially far more interesting. Greimas and Landowski studied a Company Law statute (Loi N. 66-537, 5 There is a considerable literature. An attractive starting point is provided by J. B. Thompson in Critical lHetmeneutics CUP (1981) 71-111 and his bibliography. 6 An elementary introduction may be found in P. Guiraud, Semiology. R. and K. P. London and Boston (1975) and a broader survey in T. Hawkes' Structuralism and Semiotics, Methuen, (1977).</page><page sequence="3">ANTHONY BECK 477 24th July 1966) in curious circumstances. They were members of the Groupe de Recherches Semiolingistiques at the University of Paris. Greimas is the originator of a theory that all human discourse has a common semiological basis. The Groupe was commissioned by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry to write a report on the statute as part of an inter-disciplinary programme. It is necessary to say at the outset that the narrowness of this project is acute. It is related to a particular statutory source within a particular legal system, and is restricted to analysing the internal architecture of the text. Accordingly it addresses a limited number of theoretical problems. In fact the project is described by its authors as an hypothetical pilot study. Jackson does not, however, make any substantial distinction between the pilot study, Greimas's general theory, or the work of other semiological contributors. Jackson divides his account of Greimas and Landowski's applied semiology of law under three headings: semantic, syntagmatic and paradigmatic aspects. SEMANTIC ASPECTS The section on the semantic aspect is concerned with how meaning is generated, i.e. the institutional sources of legal meaning and the general qualities of legal meaning. Though Jackson considers various minor problems, he underestimates the major problem. This is how to give a semiological account of legislating. Greimas and Landowski, we are told, characterize the statute in question, which creates a kind of corporation, a 'Societ6 Commer- ciale' (we are not given the text of the statute), as a characteristic act of naming which thereby creates a semiotic object. This curious kind of object thereby becomes a component of legal discourse. 'The act of naming in legislation itself serves as a sign in legal discourse'. Thus the legal meaning is created by an act of legislation which is itself a sign. It is hard to see how this can be the case. Where is that part of the sign which is a concrete mark, known in linguistics as the signifier? The procedures which had to be gone through for the statute to be enacted can be seen as a necessary condition for the meaning of the statute to be constituted as legal, but what sense is there in saying that the carrying out of these procedures is a sign? Furthermore, what connection is there between the procedure and the statutory text? Jackson makes it perfectly clear that statutory texts make claims for being legal, and it is the claims which semiology is concerned with, not whether they are true. But the verification of the text as legal, the constitution of the 'semiotic object' as part of legal discourse, requires some conjunction with the world which is outside the text. The practice of looking to see if the statute was passed by the legislature cannot be reduced to identifying a sign, if only because this 'sign' is not part of the text. Identifying it requires a practice quite distinct from reading, interpreting, the statutory text. It is a familiar practice described by Hart as the application of a secondary rule. (We will not be surprised subsequently to find Hart's Rule of Recognition</page><page sequence="4">478 THE SEMIOLOGY OF LAW treated as a sign.) The incorporation of the validating condition as a sign looks like a subterfuge to permit a pure semiological account of adjudication. How can semiology explain the power of an institution to create a legal category within a norm without going outside the text? Another problem of this particular study is the ontology of what Jackson calls the 'semiotic object'. This term encompasses legal persons and, indeed, all legal categories. What sort of reality does a legal category have? Clearly it is a part of the meaning of the text, but in what sense is it an object? A more cautious semiotician, the Venezuelan, Roque Carrion-Wam, noticing that there may be nothing in the real world to count as a Soci6t6 Commerciale, at the time of the enactment, prefers to call the legal concept an empty space, an eventuality to be defined. The theoretical value of such formulations is elusive. It may be compared, to its detriment, with Bentham's notion of power-sharing, whereby the sovereign creates general categories which can be particularized by subordinate power-sharers.7 If Professor Jackson is insufficiently critical of the ability of semiotics to explain power and of the vagueness associated with the ontology of the juridical universe, he is also insufficiently disturbed at the inaptness of the term 'hyponomy' to describe legal discourse. This term has come to mean in linguistics the logic of words which subsume other words. Thus 'flower' subsumes 'rose' and rose is accordingly a hyponym of flower. Jackson attempts to predicate this relation of legal semantics in general, i.e. ordinary language words are hyponyms of legal categories-an 'intentional blow in the face' is a hyponym of 'assault'. Yet he notices, of course, that judges may insert concepts into categories, or exclude them, for policy reasons. What is then to be made of hyponomy as an independent characteristic of legal discourse? This is part of the problem we noticed earlier of a semiology which does not accommodate social action. A more sophisticated theory of signs would also recognize as does Julia Kristeva, for example, that signs can generate new meanings.8 Even this is unsatisfactory because it ignores the agency which actually introduces those meanings, which is outside the sign. SYNTAGMATIC ASPECTS The next section, on the syntagmatic aspect of legal discourse, causes further difficulties. Structuralism, which is the basis of Saussure's semiology, recog- nizes two axes along which meaning is constructed. The syntagm is the horizontal structure of building bricks, or words, the ordering of parts of speech which allows them 'to make sense. Tl'his is contrasted with the paradigmatic axis which determines which words can be deployed according to 7 See H. L. A. Hart, Essays on Bentham, Ch 8,OUP (1982). 8 J. Kristeva, The IKristeva Reader Ed Toril Moi, Blackwell, Oxford, (1986) 'From Symbol to Sign' tr Hand S., 62-73.</page><page sequence="5">ANTHONY BECK 479 the rules of the syntagm to make the specific meaning of that syntagmatic arrangement. For example, a syntagm such as 'The boy kicked the ball' can accommodate such paradigm terms as 'man' or 'girl' in place of 'boy', but not 'table' or 'yellow', without absurdity or meaninglessness. The syntagmatic level of legal discourse depends on the notion that behind the horizontal grammatical array of words there is a deep-seated structure governing the meaning capable of being generated on the surface. This control, according to Greimas, depends upon a form of organization of expression governing all human thought. This challenging and fascinating position in language and sociology is virtually ignored by Professor Jackson. He is interested mainly in the purely legal syntagm. This is a 'message' from the legislature. (Or perhaps, more strictly, this is what the text claims itself to be.) We are never quite clear, however, whether the message is the whole discourse or if the message is a part, contained within the discourse. In any case, it is clear that the idea of a legal source as a message is a crucial element in this approach. One would have welcomed the sort of critical linguistic evaluation of 'message' that Hart provided of the term 'command' in The Concept of Law. After all, a message in the usual sense cannot be repealed, it is not normally addressed to the world at large, it is hard to speak of it as binding or continuing in force. Presumably these qualities, according to Greimasian semiotics, are merely claims of the text, of legal discourse. Nevertheless, they undermine the aptness of the term 'message'. Professor Jackson also fails to give sufficient considera- tion to the difficulty of ascertaining the addressee of the message. This normally means the person to whom the law applies, but sometimes it means only the intended recipient of the message. Both senses need far more consideration than they receive. On the other hand, the discourse (an undefined concept) is subject to certain 'canonical formulae' (never fully disclosed). The canonical formulae governing the meaning of legal discourse, i.e. the deep structure, derive in Greimas's study from the analysis of one hundred Russian folktales by Vladimir Propp. Propp demonstrated that the stories depended on certain combinations of seven character types or roles and thirty-one kinds of action. lie propounded two fundamental laws: that there were specific correlations between characters and actions, and there were certain non-reversible sequences of actions. Thus he was able to illuminate fairy tales by explaining the sense we have that there is a hidden pattern in these stories which is consistent and aesthetically and morally satisfying. Thus, the initial state of villainy and lack of what is desired may be followed by an intermediate set of struggles, concluding with the ending in marriage, gain or escape. In Cinderella, for example, the plot can be analysed in terms of the lack of an invitation to the ball and the clothes needed for attending it, the villainy of the Ugly Sisters, the prince's struggle to find the owner of the slipper and a finale combining escape from home, marriage with the prince and the gain of wealth and social glory for Cinderella.</page><page sequence="6">480 THE SEMIOLOGY OF LAW Greimas also analyses legal discourse into a combination of roles (actants) and functions. On the whole he reduces Propp's number of categories at the cost (though Jackson counts it a gain) of losing the second law, that there are non-reversible sequences. However, it is clear that some kind of necessary sequence must be retained, as we shall see. It is not unduly sceptical to expect that a semiological pattern of this ilk can only be fitted to-a legal text at the cost of some strain and artificiality and that the resulting theoretical account will be an arbitrary reading of little relevance to practical life. So, alas, it is. Professor Jackson does not appear to share the view that this approach is fanciful nonsense but he does little effectively to discourage it. Let us turn to consider the issues in more detail. In Greimas' analysis roles are organized in a matrix of the following categories: subject/object (the relation of volition), sender/receiver (the rela- tion of communication) and helper/opponent (the relation of power). We are not given a complete list of functions but are told that Greimas offered an initial anthropomorphic version, which included such categories as prohibi- tion, violation and test, and an abstract later version which reduces the matter to four categories: manipulation, competence, performance and sanction. Manipulation sets the goal for the subject, competence qualifies the subject to achieve the objective, performance is the achievement and sanction is, in effect, the glorifying recognition of the achievement. In the application of this scheme to a specific corporation, the Societ6 Commerciale of the statute under examination, it is not always clear whether it is to be applied to the terms of the statute or to the subsequent description of the activities of a real corporation. Either way, it is necessary to treat the role of the corporation itself as that of a peculiar collective entity, leading to a dual existence, 'sometimes it appears as a temporary semiotic object which is symbolically dismembered' (i.e. by the distribution of profits to its members) 'while at the same time continuing as a permanent actant collectrf, a social entity which it is sought always to enrich and enlarge'. We are told that, as the members get the benefit of the profits and the management takes the blame for any losses, Greimas and Landowski were reminded of the tale of the little prince who takes only the praise and his little friend the beggar who takes any punishment. At the end of the corporate story, comes the d6nouement: the auditing of accounts. Through this process 'one achieves the "glorification of the hero" (if the accounts are sound) or the "unmasking of the traitor" (if the books are cooked)'.9 One is not told how the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry received this. Possibly they pointed out that in modern conditions management often receive bonuses, have power over declaring dividends and that shareholders do indeed take punishment in a lost dividend. A more crucial objection is that a 9 Jackson, 71.</page><page sequence="7">ANTHONY BECK 481 fairy story creates a purely imagined world. As such, the analysis of plot in formal terms is far more revealing even than such an exercise performed upon a realistic novel, which pretends to take place in the historical world. The semioticians point out that a character in a work of fiction is an illusion created by semiotic means, but so, of course, is everything in a work of fiction. But the fairy story needs little in the way of plausibility since it has its own conventions. In legal discourse the controlling factors include real, social pressures. The view put forward through semiotics, which reduces legal phenomena to discourse, depends upon fitting the discourse completely to a set of rules which exist outside the discourse. These rules may determine some features of the generation of meaning but they can give no account of the meaning and its relation to social structure. At most we have a skeleton of a legal technique which fits 'manipulation' to real human motives and competence, performance and sanction to functional practices. These are not aesthetic or necessary conventions of discourse, but legal techniques. What is lacking, even in formal terms, is an over-arching theory of law within which legal discourse occurs. In particular, as we have seen, the semiotic claim that legality of a corporation is a claim of the text provides an insufficient account of legality. There must be something outside the discourse which makes people treat the claim as justified. The suggestion of 'deep structure' ignores the functional relationship between law and social and economic practices. PARADIGMATIC ASPECTS The section on the paradigmatic aspect is the most frustrating in the book. What is at issue is whether there exist basic 'building blocks' for legal and other meaning together with fundamental rules for their finding a place in the discourse and what that place is. This goes to the structuralist enterprise of identifying the underlying relations which determine the apparently myster- ious but unalterable juxtapositions of human culture. What one expects from Professor Jackson, who to his great credit has performed a monumental synthesis of some extremely trying French debates on the subject of logical relations, is a careful evaluation of Greimas's achievement. In the event we are left without any very clear idea of the paradigmatic analysis or what building blocks and relations have been identified, nor of how successful it has proved. We are essentially left with the claim, by Greimas himself, that his analysis, whatever logical objections have been taken to it, works all the same. To attain even that we have to wade through a morass of elementary logic. The basis of this approach seems to be that there are and can be only a limited and specifiable number of logical relations through which discourse can organize its meaning. Unhappily, Jackson's exegesis of Greimas's theory begins in confusion. First we are told that, in relation to stories, Greimas invites us to organize the</page><page sequence="8">482 THE SEMIOLOGY OF LAW structure as a set of ratio-style equivalents. Specifically, the relation of the initial situation of the plot to the final outcome is the same as a problem is to its resolution i.e. A:B::C:D. The example Jackson gives does not fit this account, however. He says that acceptance of a mandate (Cinderella accepting her ball gown and coach) is homologous to the recognition of performance (when the slipper fits). In other words, he gives us the beginning of a tale in relation to its ending rather than any homologue of a problem and its resolution. He then goes on to deny that this set of ratios is a paradigmatic account of itself. Rather, what has to be discovered is a binary system of negations. It is this relation which constitutes the paradigmatic restraint. We move from light to increasing darkness. Greimas's oppositions which constitute meaning are set forth as corners of a diagrammatic square. This is called the 'semiotic square'. It exhibits relations of contraries (opposites) and contradictions (negations). Thus, once you have any meaning in the narrative, the possible relations spelt out in the semiotic square are potentially available, but it is not always clear which are available for choice and which are prohibited for structural reasons. These other corners, opposites and negations (e.g. white, not-black, not-white and black from the corners of such a square), are referred to as projections. The adoption of a term from alchemy is presumably a coincidence. Professor Jackson then asserts 'We thus see the projections of each term which give it its meaning . . .'. It is unclear why so few relations can give meaning rather than the whole range of values expressed in a language as in the Saussurean programme. Nor does Jackson clarify things by adding that we also thereby see 'the constraints which govern the choice of elements in the syntagm at any point in the syntagmatic axis'.'1 Presumably this is only the case if we accept the deep structure of the syntagm, but we are given no reason why we should. Nevertheless, Greimas attempts by some means, even if Jackson does not make them very clear, to establish the relations which govern the development of plot in narrative. Thereafter Greimas 'narrativized' the Soci6t6 Commerciale around the notions of lack and acquisi- tion and also portrayed the creation of the corporation as a sort of transform- ation of individuals into a corporate entity. This transformation around the corners of a semiotic square strikes one as arbitrary. Professor Jackson points out that this progress round the square does not in fact follow the logical definitions of the semiotic square first put forward. It is thus no longer much more than ajeu d'esprit. However, ardent to his duty, Professor Jackson then compares Greimas's faltering consistency with the rigid demands of logical, rather than semiotic, squares. He takes us from Aristotle's relations between propositions, displaying contraries and contradictories, through the depiction by Apuleius of these relations as a square (carrification), to the conversion of the square into a 10 Ibid 77.</page><page sequence="9">ANTHONY BECK 483 hexagon by Blanche by the addition of two further logical relations. These additions generate additional logical relations of conjunction and disjunction as expounded by Kalinowski. Finally, in a noteworthy synthesis, Jackson debates the relation between Greimas's square and the logician's square. It is not easy to remember that what is at stake is the fundamental sets of relations whose demonstrated existence justify the structuralist enterprise of discovering the fundamental relations underlying discourse. A great deal of work would be needed here to demonstrate and justify the connection between legal discourse and the logical models. There is no sign of it and the reader is left bewildered. Finally, we are told that Greimas has moved away in later years from seeking to discover the foundation of discourse itself and is preoccupied instead with the foundations of the understanding of discourse by the recipient. We are briefly turned towards the domain of psychology. This section is both obscure and inconclusive. The section ends with an important discussion of 'modal objects'. Modal objects include knowledge, power, will and obligation. The important point is the account of the transference of these objects within a semiotic framework. These transferences are crucial in the mediation and articulation in legal discourse of the functions of competence and performance. This gives rise to further carrifications. The deployment of these modalities is in effect a much more rigorous version of Ilohfeld's enterprise. The essential difference, however, is that transferring power or obligation, for example, is treated as a form of message. It is a purely semiotic event. This, Professor Jackson explains, reduces 'all forms of human culture to a communicational (semiotic) model'. Instead of this brief note buried in a technical discussion, one would have welcomed an entire chapter of explanation. One would like to know, for example, how the whole of human culture can be reduced to a handful of modals and how the division between meaning and action can be transcended. Tlhere is an additional claim that by virtue of this communicational model 'the distinction between "is" and "ought" is transcen- ded'.11 On the surface this is simply false. The reduction of obligation to a message ignores the specificity of what is and what ought to be. The fact that a message is sent and the fact that the message communicates an obligation does not mean that obligation is merely a fact of communication. To treat obligation as something capable of being transferred does not explicate obligation. The distinction usually recognized is that statements about what ought to be done cannot be deduced from statements as to what is the case. There is no transcending this distinction by treating obligation as created and transferred by messages. It is simply irrelevant. Professor Jackson's discussion of logical relations (deontic and aletheic) may well be of great interest to those who are interested in that kind of thing. Legal theorists will be dismayed that the 11 Ibid 105.</page><page sequence="10">484 THE SEMIOLOGY OF LAW connection between it and the work of Hohfeld, Hart, Ross and Dias is dispatched to a condensed footnote.12 SEMIOTICS AND LEGAL PHILOSOPHY At this point Professor Jackson offers some preliminary conclusions, arriving at the surprising possibility that semiology endorses positivism, contributes to natural law theory and has some of the same perspectives as American realism. What is the basis for the trifid claim? First, Jackson seems to identify the fact that semiotics involves purely the analysis of texts, as inherently 'positivistic'. This is a muddle. He seems to slide between 'positivism' as in legal theory and a notion of empiricism in the social sciences drawn from Comte. Legal positivists have transformed texts into elements in commands, rules and norms. Even if one accepts that in the second sense there is something positivistic in semiology, it is not, as Jackson believes, because meaning is simply perceptible and that texts are, as he puts it, 'visible'. Meaning is not visible and Jackson either skates over the problems here or is simply unconscious of them. Secondly, the claim that semiology is a contributor to naturalism depends upon the claim that Greimas's Narrative Grammar (his name for his theoretical enterprise) identifies the semiotic constraints which apply to all forms of human discourse. Certainly this is a shared claim with natural law theories to universality, but it does not thereby support the notion of a higher dimension of obligation of the kind naturalism claims to identify. It is at this point in the book, in a cursory way, that Professor Jackson notices criticisms that Greimas is manufacturing metaphysical categories, superfluous dimensions of fictions. His answer is simply that the whole apparatus of Greimasian semiology must be judged as to whether it is the most economical form of explanation and possesses the greatest force of illumination. This book does not persuade us that this is the case. The further criticism that semiology can only illuminate discourse and not explain what makes it specifically legal is met with the tart response that what is or is not legal is simply the ideology of legal philosophers. One would have welcomed a more serious treatment of this fundamental question. It goes to the heart of the contemporary predicament of legal theory: what is really there and what is 'merely' ideological. However, as we noticed above, this involves central questions of defining ideology and science. Professor Jackson never considers the problem sufficiently, nor seeks ade- quately to evaluate possible answers. Indeed, one would expect semiology to attempt to analyse ideology, which is inherently a part of discourse. In effect, Jackson is both treating legality as merely ideology, without justification, and refusing to theorize about ideology, a double failure. 12 Ibid 323 n 30.</page><page sequence="11">ANTHONY BECK 485 Thirdly, it is claimed serniology shares positions with realism. Basically this relies on the concern of semiology with the construction of truth claims as aspects of legal texts. This leaves the way open to separate legal reasoning from legal sources. However, a purely statute or precedent based semiology will not by itself discredit the process of legal meaning generation by adjudication. Jackson acknowledges that other kinds of discourse may also have to be taken into account. He tends to assume that so far as it is worthy of scientific study all social life is discursive. Yet this is far from obvious. A leaking reservoir, created to assist an industrial process (Rylands v Fletcher),13 does not look like a discourse and the question whether the accident should be assimilated to a wandering cow or a running-down case does not fit easily into the analytic of narrative grammar. The problem is, perhaps, whether the level of semiological analysis is simply unsuitable for performance of the kind of 'trashing' per- formed by modern realists. At the deep level of the generation of meaning nothing can be said as to whether fidelity to law is observed. The fact that an account can (possibly) be given in universal terms of the generation of meaning weighs neither in favour nor against realism. The assertion in Greimas and Landowski's work that the statutory text is 'virtual', until the judge verifies it, in itself says nothing about the process of interpretation but leaves the matter precisely where it always was. Professor Jackson's conclusion that 'Greimasian semiotics points the way towards a satisfactory integration of positivist, naturalist and realist viewpoints'14 is unfortunate, for it reinforces the suspicion that we are in the realms of alchemy. The central section of the book offers a semiological approach to narrowly selected topics taken from the work of Hart, MacCormick, Dworkin and Kelsen. This enables Jackson to offer some beautifully clear exegeses and to gather in an impressively widely drawn catch of commentaries from foreign scholars. However, he reads at times unhappily like an animated bibliography. For example on pages 306-7 we have brief references to Kalinowksi, Kelsen, Greimas, Carzo, Sampson, Dworkin, Baldinger and Wrobleski without ade- quate synthesis. This makes for tedious reading and the absence of an index is unforgivable. Most of the time, however, one has a stimulating debate which could stand almost independently of the semiotic theorizing. One would have welcomed far more cross-referencing of the discussion or, best of all, an identification of common problems and the differing problematics.15 If the problematics are truly diverse, it is not clear what discussion against a common semiotic background can hope to achieve. The chapter on Hart is devastatingly effective in disentangling a truth-condi- tion approach to meaning from meaning-in-use, and in demonstrating that the 13 LR 311I, 330 affmg, LR lEx265. 14 Jackson, 143. 15 'Problematic' is an expression used by social theorists to mean the terms and theoretical suppositions by reference to which a problem is conceived and studied.</page><page sequence="12">486 THE SEMIOLOGY OF LAW 'core' of meaning is just as much a matter of choice as interpretation. The approach is synoptic rather than concentrating on the canonical Concept of Law but suffers both from a characteristic tendency of Professor Jackson to personalize discussion and the bibliographical texture already noticed. The section relates far more closely to Grice and J. L. Austin than to Greimas. One would have liked the synoptic view to have taken more account of Hart's celebrated inaugural lecture. The contribution of Neil MacCormick's which is taken for discussion is his inaugural lecture. Presumably a synoptic view of the oeuvre would have shown too many irreconcilable features. It is of a piece with Professor Jackson's uncritical attitude to Greimasian ontology that he misses the lack of any sufficient foundation for MacCormick's 'institutional facts'. MacCormick treats contracts, for example, as institutional facts which exist in time but not in space. Jackson offers to treat this piece of Scottish metaphysics as acceptable as a scheme of interpretation, but he does not see that this is irrelevant to the author's specifically ontological claim and to its futility. Jackson's treatment of Dworkin involves a very special effect. Dworkin's assertion in the 1977 article 'No Right Answer?'"' that there is no logical space between clear cases is critically examined by inscribing it in the logical square as developed by Blanche. This procedure did not help this reader to follow a discussion which needed no help from any formal aid. The section also looks at the alleged analogy between asking a question of law in a hard case and asking whether David Copperfield had a homosexual affair with Steerforth. No one can read this without gaining a clear grasp of the debate, with the help of Jackson's triadic oppositions. One misses a more fundamental attack on the premises, as to the nature of fiction and law, which a richer semiology should mount. The lack of a hermeneutic dimension disqualifies Jackson from any substantial critique of Dworkin's later work. The similarities between Kelsen's Pure Theory and Greimasian semiology are striking and presumably worrying to Professor Jackson. In this part, however, he concentrates on the ambiguities in Kelsen's concept of a norm. The conclusion that Greimas and Landowski arrive at the same view as the later Kelsen's, namely that judicial verification is necessary to the determin- ation that a legal decision is erroneous, is based on the argument that verification by a judge is 'an essential part of the semiotic process itself'. Until then, however, the semiotic process we have been told most about is legislation. Furthermore, the discussion of verification by the judge was vague on the subject of 'legal status'. The truth seems to be that Kelsen's concern whether a decision is or is not legal can have no exact counterpart in semiology, which can only talk about claims of legality.

One would have thought that the whole programme of narrative grammar, which is said to explain the generation of meaning by identifying the constraining factors, necessarily accepts that meaning can, within some limits at least, be unequivocally objective. If so, we can accept Jackson's statement that legisla- tion and adjudication are parts of a single structure which produces legal meaning. But if decisions on legal meaning can be upset by other decisions, there is no objective legal meaning, only the claims of texts. Presumably it is the latter which Jackson intends. JACKSON'S THEORETICAL CONTIIBUTION In the concluding section, Professor Jackson puts forward his own theoretical contribution. This includes a Catherine wheel shower of suggestions which one hopes will be the subject of more substantial consideration in a later work. Jackson's essential position is that the unity of law, which is proclaimed by legal rhetoric, is contradicted by the facts of multiple systems of discourse used by different groups. Admitting over-simplification, he distinguishes the separate discourses of semiotic groups which are respectively legislative, doctrinal and judicial. He makes the suggestion that the audience for legislative discourse, for example, is the administration, the bureaucracy which will carry out the statutory objectives. Hie does not consider at any length, as we have seen, what is involved in the idea of an audience. The central conclusion is that 'There is no single genre of legal literature which serves to unify the legal system; on the contrary, these several genres not only exemplify but fortify the separateness of the various semiotic systems at work within "the law" '. It is not clear why the unity of a system should depend upon the sameness of the systems of communication involved within it. A railway system issues directives to staff, advertises to a public, signals to trains and so forth, but one does not doubt the possibility of an operational unity and even an internal normative consistency. When we are warned that each individual norm may have to be treated as a separate discourse we may want to give up regarding semiology as a tool of theory. But that would be too extreme a reaction. However, in this last section, Professor Jackson exaggerates the claims which can be made for semiology in the context of developing computer based algorithmic expert systems. He pays too little attention to the intractable problems in computerizing legal advice, closely connected with problems of legal theory, which semiology cannot solve.17 17 See R. E. Susskind 'Expert Systems in Law: a Jurisprudential Approach to Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning' 49 MLR 168 (1986).</page><page sequence="14">488 THE SEMIOLOGY OF LAW Semiology should offer a liberation of the spirit from the trammels of language. No one seriously interested in legal theory should fail to read a book which, despite its shortcomings, explores this important area and we are all greatly indebted to the generous cosmopolitanism and untiring curiosity of the author. He has put his readers in his debt by putting us in touch with a complex and difficult European movement. Perhaps for the first time, because of Professor Jackson, we are now able to contribute to it.</page></plain_text>
