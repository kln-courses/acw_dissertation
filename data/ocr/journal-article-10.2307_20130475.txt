Cam bridge, Massachusetts: MIT, 2003. x + 493 pp. Cloth, $39.95?This ex tended, provocative, and extensively documented meditation addresses Vitruvius' intention in producing the first treatise on architecture, the only one surviving from antiquity, which was dedicated to Caesar Au gustus. McEwen argues that in assembling various preexisting frag ments into a coherent whole and putting that whole into words to pro duce "the whole body of architecture," Vitruvius is producing the counterpart to Augustus' program, that of making a coherent unity from the spatial fragments of the world under Roman rule and from their scattered peoples. Vitruvius explains how this architecture would serve, embody, and make visible the imperial program in the new and renewed cities and the fora, temples, and theaters prominent in them. In an earlier book (Socrates'Ancestor: An Essay on Architectural Be ginnings. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1993) McEwen used similar methods of philology and architectural history to argue that in sixth cen tury BC Greece, the invention of subsequently canonic, paradigmatic conventions of western architecture and the emergence of the founda tions of speculative thought presented complementary ways of grap pling with the same new awareness of man's place within the cosmos. This book also seeks the meanings lying beyond the architectural forms and the words devoted to them at the time they were generated. The re</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 459 suit introduces provocative, new topics within Vitruvian studies, an in creasingly urgent task now that modernist architectural practice and theory have obviously reached dead ends. Central to his theory is Vitruvius' explanation that architecture is composed of fabrica and ratiocinatio (two of many words McEwen wisely leaves untranslated), the former the work of the hands, the latter that which "can show how, and explain to what degree, things have been made with skill and calculation" (p. 32). McEwen juxtaposes this against another important theme: that in their work architects must seek the substance and not the mere shadow. Reversing the usual inter pretation, she argues that the theory, not the building, is the substance. Only here is found architecture's authoritative ratio that, according to Vitruvius' Pythagorean numerology and Stoic doctrine, can elevate mere building to architecture and make material the equivalent to what words become through oratory. Without ratio, buildings cannot serve their ap propriate office (officium). With ratio buildings as architecture pos sess the coherence which Stoics understood to be the touchstone of truth which "was a body, 'a collection of several elements, consisting in knowledge,' and to a certain degree equivalent to reality itself (p. 57; quoting Sextus Empericus). Book 3 addresses temples, which serve religio, where heaven and earth's ratio intersect in the public affairs of men. Here we encounter the familiar "Vitruvian man" from whom can be generated a circle and square. The circle generates a sphere, which is the totality and unity of all, and the square produces the squared (quadrata) place, which men make for their habitation within the spherical heavens by using augural procedures to impose right-angled axes and to incorporate celestial ro tations. Quadrated temples fix man's relation to the universe, while the numbers consistent with Vitruvian man?4, 10, and 16?fix the ratio of the symmetria visible in the coherent whole composed from parts. The result is an apparent beauty, venustas, the sensual beauty related to Ve nus who figures throughout Roman and Augustan religio as a generator of goodwill, rather than pulchritudo, the invisible Platonic beauty, which resonates with ethical content absent from Vitruvius' treatment. "Vitruvian man is a metaphysical proposition" (p. 162) embodying the continuity between the coherence, symmetria, and ratio of the universe, the august emperor king's governing of it, the king's body, and the build ing produced through fabrica and ratiocinatio. McEwen claims that while the anthropomorphic analogy had long furnished units of mea surements and even common proportional relationships for buildings and in other applications, Vitruvius is "almost certainly" the origin of the idea that it provides uthe justifying principle for having all parts of build ings (particularly temples) relate to one another proportionally" (p. 273). There is much more connecting building's fabrica, the universe, the governing of men's affairs, and architecture's ratiocinatio, all of it worth serious inquiry because Vitruvius is the point of departure for all theories linked to the traditions using ancient architectural traditions down to the present. Augustan Rome, having absorbed both Alexandrian and Egyptian ideas of the centrality and divinity of the au</page><page sequence="3">460 ARAN CANES AND STAFF tocratic ruler, is the origin of the imperial idea, and Vitruvius' "body of architecture" articulates the fictions serving this first "body of empire." The two remained interlocked until a violent reaction challenged auto cratic government and the Augustan architectural fictions were ban ished in the interest of various modernist programs. Many still accept the modernist position that classical architecture is necessarily and in trinsically an architecture of autocracy. Those who are disillusioned with the modernists' alternatives will find a great deal to ponder as they ask whether, or how, the substantive principles founded in fabrica and ratiocinatio and their shadow in conventional architectural forms can serve our present understanding of the universe and of man's place in it.?Carroll William Westfall, University of Notre Dame.</page></plain_text>
