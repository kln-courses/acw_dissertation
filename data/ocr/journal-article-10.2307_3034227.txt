<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SECOND REFLECTION: PRESENCE AND OPPOSITION IN CONTEMPORARY MAORI ART* NICHOLAS THOMAS Australian National University Structural analysis saw myths and art forms as means through which contradictions in social life could be resolved. This article deals with art forms which address contradiction, but adopts a historicized, poststructural perspective, which suggests that art produced under colonial cir- cumstances may be concerned to image oppositional relationships rather than reconcile them. The binary assemblages of the sculptor Robert Jahnke are shown to be empowered by an understanding of oppositional colonial relationships, and situated in the broader context of the Maori cultural renaissance within New Zealand. These works draw in subtle ways upon tradi- tional art and colonial history, but refuse the constraints of artistic traditionalism. They insist upon the presence and dynamism of indigenous culture, and posit an uneasy parity between the Maori and immigrant white cultures in New Zealand. Contradiction and context In an important essay on Maori art, Michael Jackson interpreted one of the classic forms of carving in terms informed by the Levi-Straussian thesis that tensions and contradictions in social life 'tend towards their resolution' in myth and art (1972: 35). He suggested that pare, the elaborate lintels which generally combined human figures, the lizard-like manaia, and the double spirals that make Maori carving instantly recognizable, displayed a threefold structure. This form expressed a logic by which opposed or differentiated elements could be synthesized or unified through a third term. The upraised arms of the human figures, which in some cases seem to strain against a superior plane, themselves suggested the well-known myth of genesis in which the male sky (Rangi) was locked in embrace with the female earth (Papa), stifling their six sons, until one, Tane, succeeded in pushing them apart, opening up the world of light and creating the precondition both for his own subsequent exploits and for human life in general (Jackson 1972: 47-48) (fig. 1).1 The artefact would seem not only to recapitulate the myth, but to augment and particularize its meanings in the patently liminal space of a house's threshold. From the perspective of a poststructural anthropology, the strength of both Levi-Strauss's original formulation and Jackson's application of it might lie not * J.B.

This is not to say that the contradictions are resolved; Jackson noted that the relationships he sought to identify were not static but 'dynamic and emotionally powerful, the results of continuous stresses to which man as a social person is put, of the intellectual contradictions which all human life creates' (1972: 72). The stresses here pos- ited are, as for Levi-Strauss, universal, and it might be objected that the tensions and contradictions that frequently preoccupy artists arise from cultural</page><page sequence="3">NICHOLAS THOMAS 25 and historical particulars, rather than from predicaments of life or sociality as such. For a people such as the Maori experiencing colonization, dynamism does not derive so much from 'continuous' stresses as from radical changes, impositions and innovations: land is expropriated, new exchange relations emerge, new forms of violence are confronted, and messianic resistance emerges. Levi-Strauss claimed that the artist's 'genius consists in uniting inter- nal and external knowledge, a "being" and a "becoming"' (1962: 25), and this is suggestive for colonial circumstances. The process linking becoming and being can be understood as one of explication, as a production of explicit oppositions out of implicit tensions; what has been revealed can be reflected upon and transformed. Art may therefore be understood not merely to mediate or ame- liorate problematic relations that already exist, but as an effort that presents and produces what is problematic. This essay deals not with traditional Maori carving but with the recent work of one Maori artist which appears at least superficially to belong more to an internationalized contemporary style than a Polynesian tradition. Robert Jahnke's art is concerned above all with contradictions in colonial relationships, but apparently entails no dynamic of synthesis or resolution. The assemblages I discuss in detail below can be seen, rather, to insist that an opposition pos- sesses an irreducibly contradictory character; complementarity creates no reassuring sense of balance or coherence, but an unsettling condition of ten- sion. This condition appears permanent rather than temporary, and necessary rather than contingent, yet its formulation in these terms does not so much reinforce a deadening sense of inevitability, as empower a subversive and trans- formative historical imagination. If an analysis privileges innovative action in historical contexts, it will be less concerned with transformations of structure than with practices that displace (or seek to displace) one account of structure by making another explicit. This is to move beyond rather than within a structural paradigm. 'Historical con- texts' are not, of course, natural locations that require only a scholar's specification, but are both at issue in, and the products of, contentions con- cerning places, traditions and identities. Peoples in many times and places have made competing claims to land and to knowledge, and it would be ethnocen- tric to suppose that only modernity enables people to negotiate such issues reflexively; but these contentions have nevertheless acquired a novel intensity in the tentatively 'postcolonial' nations of Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. In these societies made up of indigenous minorities, white settlers and non- white immigrants, issues concerning the definition and value of the different cultures each group is seen to possess can only arise constantly. There can only be tensions between ideas of culture and identity that privilege heritage and origin, and those that privilege new combinations and relocations; and the commemoration of historical events can only raise questions about how differ- ent groups are centred or marginalized within national narratives. Although the indigenous-settler relationship has not obviously entered a 'postcolonial' phase, the exhaustive debate around terms such as 'identity' makes colonial relation- ships and the identities they enabled on both sides visible and susceptible to reformulation, to a novel degree. Contemporary art, in these settler-colonial</page><page sequence="4">26 NICHOLAS THOMAS societies as elsewhere, is frequently concerned in some sense with cultural politics; specifically because the issues are often handled reflexively An anthro- pology of this kind of art might focus its attention upon the process of explicating or critically reaccentuating meanings, rather than upon their origi- nary structuring. 'High art' and national imaginings Anthropologists might be suspicious of the bias towards elite culture which an anthropology of contemporary art might have, as opposed to the studies of ritual arts or self-decoration that would seem to possess more collective sali- ence in traditional milieux. Current work in the anthropology of material culture and cultural studies is certainly oriented away from 'high art' and to- wards popular media and apparently mundane artefacts such as domestic appliances, interior decorations and so on (Ang 1985; Miller 1987). Anthropol- ogy should certainly deal with cultural phenomena in their range and diversity, but it is important to recall that 'high art' frequently has a particular importance at a national level (as does the novel; cf Anderson 1983: 32-7). This can be both at the time of its initial production, and through subsequent phases of display, which may involve heavily-promoted exhibitions, and the mass circu- lation of engraved reproductions (in the past) and posters and postcards (in the present). While examples might be drawn from European paintings dealing with cru- cial national events such as the victory at Waterloo (Colley 1992: 364-7),2 or from the representations of landscape traditions in terms that appeal to conser- vative notions of Englishness (cf Barrell 1991), the significance of art in colonies of white settlement such as Australia and New Zealand is more im- mediately relevant to the present discussion. Bernard Smith has shown that landscape painting played a key role in fostering sentimental attachments to the antipodean environment on the part of a white population that was in the process of defining the land as its own (1985: ix, ch. 9, passimn). While evoca- tions of a wilderness giving way to pasture and ordered cultivation appear to be representational in the most straightforward sense, Forge's comment on the unimportance of representation in Abelam art might be relevant to these en- tirely different works: 'The meaning is not that a painting or carving is a picture or representation of anything in the natural or spirit world, rather it is about the relationships between things' (1973: 189). Settler paintings are also 'about' the relations between things: they do not represent the land or terrain itself, in any uncomplicated sense, but rather posit and seek to naturalize a sense of belonging, not least by presenting operations of cultivation and do- mestication which had long been constitutive of property rights, law, and civility in European thought (see plate 1 between pp. 28 &amp; 29). Here, surely, the artist is 'between being and becoming', not merely mediating a historical context, but contributing in a crucial way to the 'texting' of that context, by anticipating or making explicit something that might as yet have been inchoate, and that in any case required revelation and rediscovery for successive genera- tions of settlers. What was being accomplished in the early days of settlement is currently being challenged if not undone, as indigenous rights in Australia</page><page sequence="5">NICHOLAS THOMAS 27 are renegotiated through the land rights process, especially in the wake of the High Court's Mabo decision, which overturned the colonial doctrine of terra nullius by recognizing native title. Revisionist exhibitions may now subvert the intentions and effects of the settler landscapes by making the issue of literal and aesthetic appropriation explicit, and thus in turn contribute to a different defi- nition of nationhood, in which dispossession is acknowledged as something that needs redress. In Aotearoa New Zealand, art works and exhibitions are peculiarly important to the imagining of the nation's history and the future that should follow from it, for the same and somewhat more specific reasons. Like Australia and Can- ada, New Zealand is a former British colony of settlement, but the question of the ramifications of colonial history and their implications for New Zealanders' self-perceptions have been addressed in a more consistent and concerted way than in either of the other two countries, in part perhaps because the country lacks other major differences of culture and ethnicity comparable to those arising from francophone Quebec or the sheer extent of non-British and non- European migration to Australia. New Zealand is importantly different also because the Maori were and are relatively homogeneous, in comparison with the indigenous populations of many settler colonies; the fact that there is one Maori language, and a sufficient degree of cultural commonality, means that 'Maori culture' can be understood as a totality that can be juxtaposed with that of Pakeha - immigrant whites being referred to, significantly, by a Maori term of nebulous origins and connotations (King 1991; Sharp 1990: 64-9). An aim to redefine Aotearoa New Zealand as a 'bicultural' nation became increasingly intelligible over the 1980s, as the debate about 'race relations' in the country focused upon the meanings and significance of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi (see Orange 1987). The Treaty, which effected an ambiguous cession of sovereignty on the part of Maori in return for rights and guarantees that were subsequently violated (plainly in some cases and arguably in others), acquired new centrality through the work of the Waitangi Tribunal in particu- lar. The Tribunal was established in 1975 to hear Maori grievances against the Crown that related to the Treaty. It initially had only limited advisory powers, but became steadily more consequential from the mid-1980s, after it acquired the capacity to bind the government to implement decisions concerning the restitution of resources to Maori, and as its jurisdiction was radically expanded to make admissible retrospective claims over the whole period since 1840 (Sharp 1990: 74-81). Given that this highly-publicized, wide-ranging and open-ended legal process has proved such a crucial instrument for the redistri- bution of resources, in areas such as education as well as more obviously in relation to land and extractable resources, it is not surprising that Maori do not generally dismiss the Treaty - that is now, symptomatically, also referred to as Te Tiriti - as a tactic of dispossession, but insist rather that it possesses continu- ing salience and must be honoured. The foundation of the whole process in a dyadic contract has reinforced the sense that what is at issue is a relationship between settlers and indigenous people that is irreducibly binary: even though the relation of various tribes to the Treaty was of course highly differentiated (and not all signed), the fact of a</page><page sequence="6">28 NICHOLAS THOMAS contract retrospectively constitutes two parties, as two parties are indeed argu- ably constituted, in a rivalrous and contradictory relationship, by the process of settler colonization itself This is to say that the relationship would seem not only binary, but also ambiguously asymmetrical. On the one hand, to describe people as tangata whenua, as indigenous, is to accord them a unique status, even though it is not obvious what if any distinctive entitlements should follow from this;3 on the other hand, the one-sided character of expropriation and discrimination gives the settler population a different kind of precedence. The debate has thus made the Treaty 'the founding text of Maori and Pakeha rela- tions in New Zealand' (During 1992: 344), and enabled a particular understanding of the relationship as a violated covenant, a dishonoured part- nership that may potentially be recreated and implemented afresh. Maori art, traditional and contemporary Artists such as RobertJahnke, whom I discuss in detail below, have contributed directly to this historical reimagining, but art has a prior importance in public culture in Aotearoa New Zealand, which might be attributed partly to the conspicuous and distinctive character of indigenous carving. Canoe prows, storage boxes, ancestral figures carved into house posts, and other components of meeting-houses, food storehouses, gateways and similar structures were fre- quently considered striking and emblematic by Europeans, even at times when Maori people and their cultures were, in other respects, most harshly deni- grated. Maori motifs have frequently been appropriated to nationalist iconography and decorative purposes, across a bewildering range of commer- cial, official and high artistic products; the national airline, for instance, uses the distinctive koru motif (a line terminating in a bulb) on aeroplanes and as a logo in general. Here I am not concerned to trace the history of these borrow- ings and appropriations, but suggest rather that the longstanding representation of national distinctiveness through indigenous design created the preconditions for debates in which Maori art was peculiarly prominent and politicized. The 'Te Maori' exhibition, which toured the United States from 1984 to 1986 and subsequently Aotearoa in 1986-87, marked crucial changes in the status of Maori culture within New Zealand. The exhibition consisted mainly of sculpture in wood, bone and nephrite, and emphasized classic and where possible precontact pieces to the exclusion of later neotraditional forms. While this selectivity raised a variety of questions, the pieces chosen were indeed remarkable, and the apparent primitivism no doubt helped ensure the success of the show, which was enthusiastically received in New York in particular. This external affirmation of Maori culture was widely publicized within New Zealand, and secured an extraordinary attendance within the country of over 750,000, or around 25 per cent. of the entire population. The effect of the exhibition arose not merely from the pieces themselves, or from their mode of display, but also from the dawn ritual openings of the show in each venue, and an emphasis in publications, educational material and commentaries by Maori guides upon the tapu (sacred) character of the work, which demanded continu- ing regard to protocol, and recognition that the gallery became a marae, a ceremonial meeting ground, for the duration of the exhibition (Auckland Star,</page><page sequence="7">-~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~5 m . .-.... ....

The point was not that. it was regarded as the marae of any particular tribe, but unambiguously as a Maori space, which others were privi- leged to visit; the exhibition as a whole thus appeared to be under indigenous control (even if there were many Maori misgivings behind the scenes). The moment was fortuitous: a political and cultural indigenous renaissance was under way but awaiting consolidation, and 'Te Maori' seemed not only to proclaim Maori tradition, but insist that it be upheld by the nation: it 'fuelled the expectation that these values and forms will be recognized and accepted by the rest of society. That is one of the important challenges Te Maori has set for Pakeha New Zealanders' (Kernot 1987: 7; see also Mead 1986). The exhibition provoked debate around a range of issues, most of which need not be entered into here. The point of particular relevance is that the *projection of a distinctly authentic corpus marginalized experimental nine- teenth- and early twentieth-century work, including figurative painting, Maori carving on imported objects such as guns, pipes and articles of furniture, and artefacts that incorporated iron or wool in place of traditional materials. This effacement of postcontact dynamism, problematic enough in itself, was more- over accompanied by a complete exclusion of contemporary Maori art, and even a follow-up exhibition, 'Taonga Maori', included only three contemporary pieces out of 163, and these were clearly selected for their perpetuation of traditional forms. Anger on the part of contemporary artists was expressed particularly in Selwyn Muru's Te Maaoorii, a parodic sculpture marked by the tattoos of urban Maori youth and other signs of acculturation (fig. 2).

In ret- rospect, however, few would condemn the exhibition categorically: whatever limitations it (and 'Te Maori') possessed, their powerful traditionalism clearly helped create a climate of wider understanding and receptivity, in which other initiatives might be welcomed and funded: 'Kohia Ko Takaka Anake', a big overview of contemporary Maori art, was, for instance, staged by the National Art Gallery over 1990-91, and there have been many commissions for Maori artists from public bodies and corporations anxious to exhibit cultural sensitiv- ity. A climate of marginalization has been replaced by one in which dealers and curators are taking great interest in Maori art. Some artists are now doing relatively well commercially, but there is also a good deal of suspicion about the selective and shallow interest that characterizes the 'bandwagon'. In this context, contemporary Maori art has been predisposed to a critical reflexivity akin to, but more specifically motivated than, whatever reflexivity might be taken to characterize postmodern art in general. Many Maori artists draw upon and affirm traditional art forms through continuities of media, style or motif, yet adopt a critical attitude to the restrictive curatorial practices that privilege such works and deny or marginalize the continuing dynamism of indigenous art. Even contemporary material that seems largely decorative and devoid of political reference makes a statement simply by precluding the primi- tivist predisposition to equate Maori art with archaic pieces, and indigenous creativity per se with the past. Given that settler colonialism is, in a simple and brutal sense, predicated on a denial of indigenous people's coevalness, this assertion of presence is fundamentally important. Much work is, however, more overtly directed against a political quietism on the part of viewers, who might 'appreciate' fine craft or painting from the past or the present, while neglecting the history of dispossession and continuing discrimination against living Maori. Emily Karaka, for instance, has conveyed, with extraordinary power, the pain that dispossession and racism have produced. Her work not only represents suffering in images of dismemberment and crucifixion, but moreover indexes it, through a directness of technique, and often through a tortuously dense application of oil paint, which suggests the immediate tran- scription of personal and collective anguish (see plate 2 between pp. 28 &amp; 29). Her painting, like the more subtly political work of Robert Jahnke, can be taken to define, or rather insist upon, its context; it is not merely defined by, or expressive of one. In its relation to the past, much contemporary Maori art further questions museological practice and viewers' expectations. The traditionalist aesthetic of exhibitions such as 'Te Maori' values archaic work in proportion to its inde- pendence from external (Western') cultural influences and contemporary work in so far as it resists borrowing and imitates traditional material.4 The past is thus a source of techniques, forms, styles, motifs and generalized cultural prin-</page><page sequence="13">NICHOLAS THOMAS 31 ciples such as tapu - but not of events. Narrative is not wholly excluded, but it is cosmogenic myth rather than more recent genealogy and history that is appropriately illustrated. Contemporary artists resist this dehistoricizing aes- thetic, which is untrue to the narrative element in traditional and neotraditional art (see Neich 1993), and refer extensively to colonial relations in terms that frequently unite mythological references and recent develop- ments (and thus preclude the reduction of the former to depoliticized folklore). Selwyn Muru's major painting, Papatuanuku (fig. 3), which has been promi- nently displayed in the National Art Gallery,5 reproduces, across a stark, abstract field suggesting a spiritual landscape, a poem by Hone Tuwhare that described the 1975 Maori land rights march on Parliament as a caress of the earth mother (Papatuanuku) on the part of the marchers: 'We are massaging the ricked wracked back of the LAND with our sore but ever loving feet. Hell she loves it. The land turns over in great delight. WE LOVE HER.'6 The invoca- tion of the mythic persona here effects a leap across epochs and contexts that empowers a transformation of the present; but the poem's almost indefinable combination of wit and seriousness is equally crucial to the painting's effect. Such ebullience in the face of discrimination is often characteristic of Maori practice,7 yet alien to the frozen sanctity of a Maori artefact, given the unavoid- able humourlessness of any appropriately respectful curatorial practice. If traditional art has acquired a burden and the power of permanent spirituality, contemporary art has inherited the task of producing innovation, paradigmati- cally through the marking of meanings which cannot be fixed, which empower through serious play. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~._ . .... . ...... . FIGURE 3.

Refer- ence to such narratives should not be seen as a mark of innovation or 'Western' influence in contemporary art, but rather as a recovery of the kind of historical significance that ancestral sculptures originally possessed. These were not gen- eralized expressions of tribal and ethnic identity, but biographical and legendary mnemonics, that commemorated the accomplishments of particular warriors, chiefs and priests, and were elements of the architectural environments within which genealogical narratives concerning those figures were normally re- counted. Without stretching the parallel, this typifies the way in which the adoption of 'Western' style or technique may be consistent with, rather than corrosive of, continuities between traditional culture and contemporary arts. Much debate among artists and curators in Aotearoa has concerned precisely this issue - the relation between 'traditional' and 'Western' influences and aesthetics that are as clearly juxtaposed in critical discussion as they would seem integrated or combined in art works themselves (see, for example, Panoho 1991). The singular binarism of historical imaginings founded in the Treaty thus appears to function not only as a point of reference for artists, but also as a macrocosm for a Maori art negotiating the tension between indige- nous and Pakeha traditions. Although this may not be precisely what Levi-Strauss meant by 'uniting internal and external knowledge', that nexus is precisely where the asymmetries of colonial exchange might be recognized and renegotiated. I turn now to consider an artist whose work is especially distinc- tive for being animated by the space of colonial difference and by reflection upon it. RobertJahnke's Mana Whenua What matters for the dialectician is having the winds of world history in his sails. Thinking for him means: to set sail. It is the way they are set that matters. (Walter Benjamin, Passagen-Werk; quoted in Taussig 1987: 369). Robert Jahnke (b. 1951) is a Maori sculptor and art teacher who trained at the Elam School in Auckland and in experimental film at the California Institute for the Arts; he subsequently worked variously in book illustration, film, carv- ing and design before focusing on wooden and metal assemblages, and taught at college and polytechnic before moving to Maori Studies at Massey Univer- sity in 1991. His father was German-Samoan and his mother Maori-Irish, but he was brought up in primarily Maori milieux. His work is distinctive for being informed both by training in western institutions and by a deep knowl- edge of Maori art, and most particularly of colonial history and cross-cultural exchange in New Zealand. His first solo exhibition, in 1990, recast forms from meeting-house architec- ture in mixed-media assemblages, and focused upon the commemoration of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Maori prophets such as Te Kooti, Te Whiti and Rua Kenana (see plate 3 between pp. 28 &amp; 29). The choice of these figures and the associated histories is of particular interest, because many</page><page sequence="15">NICHOLAS THOMAS 33 warriors and chiefs were of equal or greater importance in the resistance to European encroachment. The millenarian movements, however, were marked, as Pacific 'cargo cults' have frequently been, by experimental departures from tradition and appropriations of elements of colonial social organization and iconography which appeared esoteric and threatening from the viewpoint of the colonizers. Jahnke sees the prophets as having struggled to create inde- pendence in a period when Maori were disillusioned and oppressed by discriminatory government, and by educational policies that robbed them of 'the ability to transcribe or interpret traditional metaphor' (quoted in Sloan 1993). Rua and others responded by drawing upon European motifs that were more immediately accessible to their people, yet susceptible to redefinition. The triangles, missionary crosses and emblems from playing-cards that marked Te Kooti's flag and the gates and houses of Rua's New Jerusalem acquired politicized and mystical associations beyond the comprehension and control of the missionaries and colonists who had initially made these motifs available. The triangle, for instance, can figure as the sacred mountain of Maungapohatu, where Rua had his visions and subsequently established his separatist, refor- mist community; it can stand for peace or, once inverted to resemble a sergeant's stripes, war. What is crucial in these operations is the apparently arbitrary character of associations and inversions: the innovative iconography is not a derivative code, specified in advance by a colonial culture, but a set of resonances that are unpredictable and empowering. The project of contemporary indigenous art, sometimes dismissed for its borrowings from western styles and for its apparent lack of grounding in indige- nous tradition, can be seen to recapitulate the prophets' apparent hybridity, and it is therefore not surprising that artists might now privilege those moments of singular experimentation in Maori history.8 Conspicuous among the symbols of Pakeha authority were flags, and one of Rua's most enduringly contentious acts was his use of a huge Union Jack upon which was inscribed in Maori, 'One law for both peoples: Maungapohatu'; this was seized by police as evi- dence of sedition, and described as late as 1957 by a New Zealand newspaper as bearing an 'insolent' inscription (Binney et al. 1979: 99). What the 'insolence' of Rua's project consisted in, presumably, was resistance to both segregation and assimilation: both autonomy and equality were demanded, and both cul- tural distinctiveness and modernity pursued. This is precisely the stance of much contemporary art in the face of the cultural legislation implied by 'Te Maori', but there is also a more important and particular connexion between Jahnke's recent work and such prophetic appropriations, in that the artist has been especially concerned with the subversive elaboration of meanings which are suggested by, though not conventionally attached to, the appropriated forms. This is apparent, especially, in Mana Whenua, a work initially shown in 'Mana Tiriti: protest and partnership', an exhibition that marked the sesquicentenary of the Treaty of Waitangi, and which therefore directly addressed the debates referred to earlier (see Young 1991). It was then entitled Nga Ata o te Venua, 'The Shadow of the Land', in reference to a famous statement by the chief Nopera Panakareao, that the effect of the Treaty was that the shadow of the</page><page sequence="16">34 NICHOLAS THOMAS land passed to the Queen, while the substance remained with the Maori. A year later, as alienation by Europeans proceeded apace, the disillusioned chief changed his mind and inverted the proposition. Jahnke's subsequent work, which I discuss below, literalizes the metaphor through a play of shadow and substance. The word ata, employed also in more recent work examining ex- change objects-cum-icons of power such as the axe, may mean variously reflection, shadow, dawn light, and image, has become a kind of signature. Mana Whenua does not work with light in the same way as the works discussed below, but is similarly energized by the dynamics of opposition and inversion. The interpretation which follows is neither simply a distillation of public responses to the work, nor a re-presentation of the artist's own exegesis. Al- though my discussion has been stimulated by and elaborated on the basis of discussions with the artist, and has drawn upon the comments of reviewers and other individual viewers, the aim is speculatively to reconstruct the reaction of a New Zealand audience conscious of its own historical context and the de- bates about biculturalism, as the audience likely to see the work in the Museum of New Zealand/Te Papa Tongarewa can hardly avoid being. While responses to Mana Whenua are of course diverse, depending upon knowledge and political prejudices as well as other factors, and while Maori and Pakeha responses will possess different emphases, I suggest that much of what follows must bear upon or be implicit within the audience's experience of the work. Although therefore informed by public and private sources, the interpretation cannot readily be tested or validated, because it attempts to make explicit what the art does, which is largely nonverbal and implicit. This essay is therefore not so much about textual 'meanings' that might be implicit in Mana Whenua, as about the work's non-textual efficacy. The forms juxtaposed are those of a European sail and a Maori or Polynesian one (see plate 4 between pp. 28 &amp; 29). It is significant that while the indigenous sail is in fact an inverted triangle, and thus existed as such prior to colonial contact, the encounter renders it as the opposite of the European form: one stands as the negation of the other, and a process of reciprocal definition and stereotypy is inaugurated, which can be taken to be constitutive of the cultural dynamics of colonial if not also postcolonial relationships (cf During 1992: 350). Each assemblage is inscribed ethnically through a series of numerals: on one side, the Maori words for numbers; on the other, roman numerals that mark the 'Western' origins of the form (fig. 4). Something at once rather more general and more specific than this appears to be important, however, if the artist's own statements are taken into account: what is connoted is not just Europe or its 'civilization', but the particular tradition of Roman and "Western' law, which was especially relevant, of course, to the original exhibition, focused as it was upon the implications of the Treaty/te Tiriti for contemporary justice. Apart from the sesquicentenary context, viewers would perhaps be more inclined to take the forms to refer more broadly to indigenous and European 'culture', and other features of the sails reinforce these identifications: one carries a motif based on the Maori koru, which contrasts with the other's elementary arcs. These crescents allude to a process of waxing and waning which is referred to in the catalogue of the Mana Tiriti exhibition: presence and</page><page sequence="17">NICHOLAS THOMAS 35 FIGURE 4. Mania Whenua, detail of 'Pakeha' sail. absence, shadow and substance, possession and dispossession are not perma- nently established conditions but indeterminate and cyclical: 'Inversion of form, the waxing and waning of structures, refer to the usurpation of mana and land' (Young 1991: 30). As the truth of Maori ownership was clear prior to the Treaty, the fact of European dominance, which has since been conspicuous, may in the future diminish or be eclipsed. VAWhat is projected is not a definite prospect of progress, but an enduring state of contingency, in which any effect or political accomplishment may potentially be reversed. This is at once a historical work that imagines past relations in particular moral terms, and an effort to foreshadow a history, to create substance out of shadow. This reading, which emphasizes the instability of relationships, is more or less what the exhibition catalogue encouraged, and is consistent with reviewers' responses (e.g. Dale 1990); but it is compelled in a more intricate and implicit way by the fact that the mere parity of Polynesian and Western forms, estab- lished and insisted upon through the forceful symmetry of this work, is challenging. In ethnographic museums, there are two more conventional ways of relating indigenous artefacts to their European counterparts which would be more familiar to jahnke's audience. This work contradicts both equally. A now dated but hardly extinct understanding would place the indigenous and West- ern objects in an evolutionary relationship: the Polynesian canoe, however remarkable, is the product of a stone age technology and hence the precursor of more advanced craft;9 one is linked to the other through a serial relationship rather than through simultaneous identification and contrast. In Mania J4/enua neither form is prior to the other, either in the sense of being archaic, or in that of being original; correspondingly, neither is privileged as a successor, nor</page><page sequence="18">36 NICHOLAS THOMAS denigrated as a copy. However, the indigenous sail is accorded a degree of precedence, both by any viewer accustomed to reading European scripts from left to right, and by one aware of the opposition within formal greeting cere- monies within meeting-houses: tangata whenua or people of the land occupy the left of the house, while manuhiri or visitors are on the right. It is however important, albeit in a wholly negative sense, that the gendered symbolism of left and right in Maori cosmology figures not at all in the work: while, in traditional terms, the left side is supposedly female, inauspicious, weak, and noa, the right is male, vigorous, strong, and tapu (Elsdon Best, quoted in Jackson 1972: 51-2).10 It might appear striking that a work so preoccupied with opposition should exclude precisely the oppositions most deeply pervasive in Maori culture, such as those between male and female, senior and junior, raw and cooked, life and death, and so on (see, for example, Hanson &amp; Hanson 1983; Sahlins 1985); but this is not at all surprising, given that these contrasts are all hierarchically valued and sometimes also transformatively related (in the case of life and death or raw and cooked). Against these relations, Jahnke's work would insist upon parity as opposed to asymmetry, and upon the perma- nence of opposition as opposed to the possibility of assimilation or transmutation. The assemblage thus resists any hierarchizing differentiation of indigenous and European forms, although the upraised element of the top crosspiece in the Maori sail and the overall trend of its V are enabling and uplifting, in contrast to the downturning T and oppressive weight of the Pakeha form. The work also challenges a less overtly hierarchical mode of differentiation that is now probably more common in museums, and which is aesthetic rather than evolutionist. The archaism, beauty and rarity of a nephrite adze or feather cloak places the thing in an entirely different realm to its European equivalent; it is not and perhaps never has been a commodity, and is thus in a radically different space, even to a fine western garment or piece ofjewellery. Of course, there are good reasons for treating rare indigenous artefacts - objects that were always tapu - carefully and respectfully, but the curatorial project has a sterilizing and segregationist aspect, that subtracts not only from the proximity of things, but also from the lives attested to in their decay In some of his earlier assemblages about the prophets, Jahnke used recycled wood; though the use of old timber resonates with many artists' experiments with demolition materials and objets trouves, it is here a kind of affirmation of the deterioration and loss that is necessary to a life cycle and a genealogy, and a protest against the clinical stabilization of heritage that the restoration of carvings and meeting houses entails. This is in the background in Mana Menua;11 but the insistent simulta- neity of the two cultural forms interrupts any encroachment of the museum-cum-cultural mausoleum. For a Pakeha viewer, the Other can only be here and now, not in an antecedent or distant realm. What may be still more important is the fact that there is no perspectival space in this work, from which a self can gaze upon an other (in contrast, say, with any portrait, and particularly one of a Maori or Pacific Islander). However viewers identify themselves, they are compelled to conjure with both the fact of co-presence, and a relationship of mutual definition that cannot be eluded or wished away.</page><page sequence="19">NICHOLAS THOMAS 37 Mana Whenua is pervaded not only by opposition, but by tension, because the equivalences which are asserted conflict at once with the absolute difference between shadow and substance, and the circumstances of the world beyond the work. Despite the range and significance of Maori gains, the continuing domi- nance of Pakeha and continuing oppression of Maori are incontestable, most particularly because the latter have been injured disproportionately by the eco- nomic slide of the last decade, and are hardly likely to be the first beneficiaries of the recovery that is notionally now under way. Against the persistence of profound inequality, Jahnke disrupts the binarism of the work by inscribing on both sides certain motifs and words, such as 'Mana o te whenua' ('mana of the land')12 and the esoteric squares and crosses reminiscent of Te Kooti's and Rua's signs. While the dates and numbers are marked on both sails, there is no Pakeha statement or slogan that is comparably imprinted on both (fig. 5). The overpowering but disrupted parallelism at once effects a critique of more conventional ways of seeing and curating cross-cultural relations, and gives A FIGURE 5. Mana Whenua, detail of 'Pakeha' sail.</page><page sequence="20">38 NICHOLAS THOMAS material form to a basic paradox. One implication is that there is a fundamental and permanent difference between Maori and Pakeha, but this difference is explicit and visible specifically because the two are, in underlying respects, the same. Sail and mast are locked into a common relation and carry dates and numbers that are identical, inverted or otherwise linked. There is an affirma- tion of shared humanity that is surely politically rather than sentimentally motivated. The equivalence of Pakeha and Maori, as signatories to the Treaty, and equally committed partners in its development and implementation, is understood, as noted earlier, to be pivotal to progress towards a genuinely bicultural society. Like Rua's flag, Mana Whenua disrupts a law of dominance by taking the principle of equality before that law too literally; it elaborates and pushes the principle to an absolute condition of formal pairing. Both the flag and the assemblage effect a kind of ironic displacement, which is enabled particularly by the official suppression of the flag, and the gap between Mana Vhenua and the actualities of the Maori-Pakeha relations that the work seems to represent. These resistances of the world to the work expose ironies internal to colonial law - as a code ostensibly governed by principles of equality is shown to organize and disguise discrimination - and, on the basis of that explication, potentially produce a transformation of the law's effect. 'What began merely as an empty affirmation of Justice and Equality is given new substance, and its letter insisted upon, by those whom it was designed to disenfranchise. What- ever the actual effect ofJahnke's work upon its diverse viewers, the point might be that this process would match and reinforce the transformation of the Treaty/te Tiriti itself, which now has binding effects that could surely never have been anticipated by the colonists who drafted and translated it in bad faith. One structure thus supplants another, as a shadow is given weight and the weight of a shadow insisted upon. The historical ironies here are acute, yet their presentation in this work is restrained and serious, as is consistent with its mood of unsettled anticipation rather than either revolutionary optimism or embittered pessimism. A second reflection In a similar way, Jahnke's more recent show, 'Te Ata Tuarua: the Second Reflec- tion', is deeply if not explicitly political. Most of these installations consisted again of pairs; the crucial form was not a sail but a Doric column, which could be seen to have been extracted from Western culture in much the same way that the West appropriated artefacts and curiosities from indigenous peoples (see plate 5 between pp. 28 &amp; 29, &amp; fig. 6). Just as Oceanic sculptures and African masks were stripped of their localized meanings and functions as they were relocated in private collections and museums, Jahnke's columns, in most cases, are deprived of architectural use; they do not support an edifice, but are framed within one. In both this operation and the colonial collecting that it ironically recapitulates, however, appropriation does not so much obliterate meaning as make it highly allusive and elusive. Just as a mask could become an emblem for a fantasized and generalized 'primitive mentality', or for the mys- teries of fetishism, so the column comes to signify European culture as such,</page><page sequence="21">NICHOIAS THOMAS 39 FIGuRE 6. Robert jahnke, Te Iho I (1 992), wood, lead, acrylic, 171 0 mm x 1255 mm, from the exhibition 'Te Ata Tuarua/The Second Reflection', Fox Gallery, Auckland. from its imagined Greek beginnings to its late colonial extensions, so often expressed in neoclassical state architecture. The singular aptness of the isolated column arises from the fact that it suggests both imperial tniumph (in the case of monuments such as Nelson's Column) and classical ruins. In European thought since Volney, antiquities were crucial markers of the cyclical character of history: Greek and Roman civility and power might be emulated, but the fragments of their former grandeur could only forcefully remind the viewer of the transience of particular civilizations and empires (a sentiment expressed</page><page sequence="22">40 NICHOLAS THOMAS particularly starkly in Shelley's 'Ozymandias'). The translator accompanying a French voyage even suggested in 1800 that New Zealand might one day pro- duce her Montesquieus, Lockes and antiquarians who would travel 'to contemplate the ruins of ancient London and Paris' (quoted in Smith 1985: 150). These references may not have been present to Jahnke's intentions, but they certainly resonate with them. For the artist himself, the connotation of the whole structure of colonialist law and regulation is most significant: with respect to the work 'Impediment', in which the columns did in fact frame an entry, he said You are invited to enter this foreign realm only to be confronted by an impediment ... Such is life that illusion often substitutes for reality, the invitation to participate in this democratic society which has been founded on the edifying principles of clas- sical heritage, is often a facade ... many entrances that invite and entice are often culturally exclusive.'13 The Roman numerals, like those on the Pakeha sail in Mana Whenua, are thus to be taken less as a sign of Western civilization in general, and more as an emblem of an ambiguous political and legal heritage. The ambiguity is reinforced by the similarity between the column and a ship's cannon, an instrument of Enlightenment voyaging that was used as well as displayed in the course of early contacts in New Zealand. Typically the column in one of the paired works is a solid wooden form and in the other a mirror or a void. The half marked as Maori by the words for numbers or other inscriptions was usually solid, which could be taken to re- flect either a categorical pre-eminence that tangata whenua should possess, or echo an easy imputation common in some public discussion of New Zealand identities that Maori culture has a depth, spirituality and substance which Pakeha modernity lacks. Although the works may well have been read in this way by some viewers, such an understanding is undermined, once again, by the operation of reversibility. The artist told me that he felt that these assemblages worked best in the Dowse Museum (at Lower Hutt near the capital, Welling- ton), where the lighting tended to reverse the qualities of the positive and the negative sides: 'if you play light on it, the three-dimensional form becomes vacant, or the shadow becomes meaningless ... it has no shape, whereas if you play on the negative form it becomes positive, because it creates a shape' (inter- view, March 1993). Here again, the assertion that alternation is everywhere possible can only be politically charged. These works have the look of international contemporary art, and indeed reflect art school training and 'Western' techniques, as they are also produced within and for a commercialized art world. Jahnke's work can, however, be seen to conform with certain features of classical Maori art, however sharply it differs from it on the surface. One of the most striking features of the sails of Mana Whenua is their weight and solidity; the idea of a lead and hardwood sail is not a joke, but a transposition of form across media, comparable directly to the replication of forms such as hand clubs in wood, bone and nephrite, and generally to the transposition of motifs between carving, painting and facial tattooing. These transformations suggest that what is important is not representation but the different values and potentialities the media possess: a nephrite piece, for example, will possess heirloom as well as functional status,</page><page sequence="23">NICHOLAS THOMAS 41 and bear a genealogy and history A European painting, and more especially something such as a flimsy snapshot, seems indisputably less substantial than the thing or person it represents; it consists merely of paint, pencil, emulsion or whatever, on canvas or paper. In the case of the sail, it is the canvas or pandanus that is insubstantial: the artwork is not a thinner copy, but a kind of prototype that has a permanence which no particular utilitarian expression can possess. The weight of Mana Ihenua also lends it an iconic status; it has the capacity to define and produce relations and specifically irresolutions. It is a productive work, a work that produces presence, rather than a representational work that merely depicts existing opposition or conditions in the world that are already visible. Like the transposition of forms across media of varying quality and substance, the orientation towards presentation rather than representation was fundamental in nineteenth-century Maori art: the sculpted ancestral fig- ures in meeting-houses and the architecture of those houses themselves created embodiments rather than depictions. The relation of ancestors to living descendants, to members of families and tribes, was not imaged, but more immediately produced.14 The overall logic of disrupted symmetry in Mana Whenua and the binary works of Te Ata Tuarua, moreover, parallel the kowlhaiwhai painting of meeting- house rafters, which typically consist of arc and koru forms in white lines, filled in with black and red (figs 7 and 8). Allan Hanson has drawn attention to the elaborate bilateral symmetry characteristic of these patterns, which is however broken through interstitial additions, direct transposition in place of inversion, and a variety of other devices that are in most cases plainly deliberate. This formal language of broken bilateral symmetry is also attested to in facial tattoos and woodcarving, and in Hanson's view reflects a Maori construction of the world, in which 'the fundamental quality of reality is ambivalent tension - between identity and difference, attraction and repulsion, union and separation' (1983a: 215). In fact, disrupted symmetry is common in Oceanic art, and is conspicuous, for instance, in canoe prows and dance paddles from the Trobriands and other parts of New Guinea, in Asmat and Sepik shields, and in the Marquesan clubs known as 'u'u. It is significant that all these art forms are associated with warfare or competitive performances, or contexts in which a group sought to disorient or awe those who were enemies or visitors. This was certainly true of Maori meeting-houses, which were elaborated over the nine- teenth century, a period of great conflict and instability, particularly in order to hold meetings with Europeans and other Maori relating to warfare, land acqui- sition and related matters. Even if the principle of ambivalent tension, and the disorienting effect of broken symmetry, are not peculiar to Maori culture, the continuities with Jahnke's work and with other contemporary Maori art are resonant: people of the land or place use a disorienting play of parity to awe their visitors, allies or opponents. While I have foregrounded the politics of both Mana Wlhenua and Te Ata Tuarua, other readings, emphasizing the forms of traditional culture, might also be advanced, and are encouraged by the titles of some of the works in the more recent exhibition, that refer to cosmogenesis. The importance of light, in particular, is perhaps more readily interpreted by New Zealanders with even a casual acquaintance with Maori mythology as a</page><page sequence="24">42 NICHOLAS THOMAS FIGuRE 7.

The inversions and potential inversions of form, shadow, substance and hierarchy are not moves in a detached aesthetic game, but follow from a recognition of the locations from which the works can be viewed, and this is perhaps the most crucial of their several 'second reflections' or moments of further framing and implied con- textualization. Those looking at 'Te Ata Tuarua' and Mana Whenua are caught up in relations that cannot prefigure the works' reciprocal and symmetrical forms; this disruption is made most explicit in Impediment, which was located in some venues at the entrance to the exhibition and in others at an end-point. Whether as entrance or terminus, it was intended, according to jahnke, to tie</page><page sequence="25">NICHOLAS THOMAS 43 FIGuRE 8.

'the show together', to provide a 'commentary' on the whole (interview, March 1993). There was thus, on top of the juxtaposition of complementary forms, a furtherjuxtaposition between the neatness of logical relations and the fact of an obstacle, something that was simply an impediment in general, rather than a negotiable impediment to a specific act or project. The sheer solidity and tex- ture of the materials that were worked with such virtuosity, the absolute substance of beaten lead and copper, were in a way reassuring, as were the works' abstract regularities. But the larger spectre of the impediment, together with the succession of disruptions of symmetry that revealed themselves upon closer inspection, made these works, at the same time, profoundly unsettling. jahnke's work simultaneously produces real parities that do not exist, and con- nects those equivalences with hierarchical relations which they do not match. I have placed great emphasis upon the binary character of these works. This, and their attitude to contradiction, is in a way consistent with Michael Jackson's argument concerning the trinary structure of traditional pare carvings. He claimed that the presence of a third figure or term within the structures of those lintels mirrored a logic of synthesis within Maori culture and art,</page><page sequence="26">44 NICHOLAS THOMAS through which tensions and oppositions in social life were overcome. Since my suggestion is that Jahnke's work does not image a resolution - rather it posits a contradiction in terms that resist synthesis - it should not feature any third term and indeed appears not to do so. Unless, of course, the viewer and the audience stand as the third term; in which case all the energy and uncertainty, the historical burden, the risk and the promises of parity, slip out of a space that can possibly be described in an essay of this kind, and are bequeathed to those who constitute this work's audience. NOTES This article draws upon a paper given at the fourth Decennial conference of the Association of Social Anthropologists in Oxford, August 1993; I am grateful to the overall convenor of the Decennial, Marilyn Strathern, and the section convenor, Daniel Miller, for inviting me to par- ticipate. Versions have also been presented at the East-West Center, Honolulu, and at the Australian National University. I thank Howard Morphy, Debbora Battaglia, Anne Salmond, Margaret Jolly, James Weiner, Hastings Donnan, the judges of the J.B. Donne essay competi- tion, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments. The article emerges from a project on 'Art and the politics of identity in New Zealand', which has been generously supported by the Australian Research Council. I must also thank Jane Sutherland of the Fox Gallery, Auckland, for her help, and most particularly Robert Jahnke, for a number of illuminating conversations. The editor is grateful to the J.B. Donne Fund for a subsidy towards the cost of the colour plates. 1 Jackson offers this speculatively, but it has been more recently stated unambiguously that pare carving 'symbolises the separation of Ranginui and Papatuanuku' (Taonga Maori 1989: 18, caption to figure 14). The presence of three anthropomorphic figures rather than one, together with the fact that some pare figures are clearly female, suggests that this is rather improbable. 2 The example Colley discusses is Sir David Wilkie's Chelsea pensioners reading the gazette of the Battle of Waterloo (1822), which thousands queued to see when it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy. 3 In this context it might be noted that a few Maori radicals enthusiastically supported Rabuka's 1987 coup in Fiji, which appeared permanently to privilege the indigenous 'owners of the land' by disenfranchizing the descendants of immigrant Indians. 4 The point that what is recognized as traditional frequently entails a complex synthesis of pre- and postcontact influences is well established and need not concern us here (but, for an important demonstration in the New Zealand case, see Neich 1983). 5 In early 1993 it was in a large room with only two other works of comparable scale: Colin McCahon's Second gate series (1962) and Rosalie Gascoigne's Pale landscape (1977). This is sig- nificant as a summation of postwar New Zealand art, because McCahon is pre-eminent, and stands almost mythically for a distinctively antipodean and masculine yet poetic and reflective intellect; while the other two works would be said to represent the contributions of women and Maori to the national culture. 6 Tuwhare is a prominent Maori poet whose work often refers to contemporary politics, and has often been drawn upon in painting by Ralph Hotere and others; see his collection (1992). 7 Or rather, of course, that of oppressed people in the face of authority virtually everywhere. Notable Maori manifestations are important, though, in the main male characters in the widely discussed novels, The bone people (Hulme 1983) and Once wvere warriors (Duff 1990). 8 One exhibition, 'Te Mihaia Hou' (see Tyler 1991) was specifically concerned with Rua Kenana; the prophets have also been important in the work of the senior artist, Paratene Matchett, an important influence upon Jahnke; see Panoho (1987). 9 One anonymous referee pointed out that Polynesian double (if not single-hulled Maori) canoes were in fact highly sophisticated, and that the evolutionary comparison would therefore</page><page sequence="27">NICHOLAS THOMAS 45 technical grounds, but the point that evolutionary comparison has been available, as a frame through which a variety of indigenous artefacts can be seen. In the early twentieth century an exhibition of 'naval architecture' at Sydney's Technological Museum (antecedent to the present Powerhouse Museum) in fact incorporated a Niuean canoe among other 'primitive' vessels in an evolutionist display culminating in models of modern battleships (Stephen 1993: 15). 10 It is no longer generally accepted that Maori culture devalued women in terms of this kind, though the particular nature of notions of gender and their associations with tapu and noa continues to be debated (Hanson 1983b; Valeri 1985). 11 However, the process of waxing and waning that is directly alluded to also refers to the life cycle; as the missionary Thomas Kendall wrote, imposing his own idiom onto Maori thought, 'The Moon is man's time keeper and presides over his bones' (letter to Thomas Hassall, 1823, quoted in Binney 1968: 134). 12 In fact, the words on the Pakeha sail are 'Nana o te whenua'. While the word mana would primarily be associated with influence, prestige, power, and sanctity, and these mean- ings appropriately caption the work as a whole, another sense emerges from the comparison between the two sails: mana with a long first vowel like nana is a third person possessive pro- noun; the former suggests future possession and the latter past. Future possession on the Maori sail implies 'the ideal for a return of lost taonga [treasured possessions] including land' (letter from the artist, 26 October 1993). In Maori conceptions of time, the future can be situ- ated behind one, as one is faced by one's ancestors and the past. The slippage between the antithetical constructions in the bicultural or postcolonial time of the present suggests a meet- ing of past and future and a restoration of formerly inalienable possessions. I am grateful to Robert Jahnke for elucidation of the significance of these texts. 13 The artist, quoted in a Fox Gallery press release, February 1993. 14 This is a speculative proposition that is not easy to substantiate, particularly because the non-verbal character of the potency referred to makes direct or conclusive documentation un- likely, but possibly also beside the point (cf. O'Hanlon 1992: 588-9); Neich (1983: 264) sug- gests that there was an overall trend in the 'attitude to [the] form and meaning' of Ngai Tarawhai carving from 'embodiment' in the early to mid-nineteenth century to a 'strong inter- est in referential denotation' in the early twentieth, but does not elaborate upon the notion of 'embodiment'.

A la seconde reflexion: presence et opposition dans I'art Maori contemporain Resume Un structuraliste analyse les mythes et les objets d'art comme des moyens de resoudre les contradictions sociales. Cet article, qui porte sur des formes esthetiques portant sur la contradiction, adopte une perspective resolument historiciste et post-structurale. On sug- gere que le but de l'art produit dans des conditions coloniales n' est pas de chercher a concilier des relations oppositionnelles, mais plutot de les imaginer. On montre que l'intelligence de ces relations coloniales oppositionnelles donne force et pouvoir aux as- semblages binaires du sculpteur RobertJahnke et permet de les situer dans le contexte plus large de la renaissance de la culture Maori en Nouvelle-Zelande. C'est avec beaucoup de subtilite que ces oeuvres s'inspirent de l'art traditionnel et de l'histoire coloniale tout en rejetant les contraintes de l'esthetique traditionaliste. Elles soulignent la presence et le dynamisme de la culture indigene et pretendent a une parite inconfortable entre deux cultures neo-zelandaises, celle des immigres blancs, et celle des Maori.
