<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is Primitive Art Art? H. GENE BLOCKER A gratifying recent development in American education is the desire (and demand) for greater multicultural education, including multicultural art education. For too long, the argument is, we have acted as though the only significant contributions to art, science, law, morality, literature have come from Europeans (and mainly dead, male Europeans), thus ignoring the cul- tural contributions of other traditions, ethnic groups, and the other half of the human race, as divided by gender. This omission is all the more trou- bling when it occurs in a pluralistic, multicultural, multiethnic country like our own where the students we are trying to educate are of African, His- panic, Amerindian, Asian, as well as European origin. Insofar as one of the goals of education is to help our students find a viable sense of self-identity, the emphasis on European models as the only or the most worthwhile ex- emplars is frustrating and self-defeating for many of our students-and thereby for their teachers, as well. The solution would seem to call for the expansion of the curriculum to include a study of diverse cultural heritages. The problem is how best to accomplish that worthwhile goal. One response, widely lauded, is to encourage African Americans to study African culture, Native Americans to study Amerindian culture, His- panic students to study Hispanic culture, and so on. But this actually defeats, rather than encourages, multicultural understanding, for by adopting this scheme no one is studying any culture but their own. This would therefore seem to be more a unicultural approach, in which each student studies but one culture, the one with which they identify in terms of ethnic origin. It is multicultural only in the sense that many different cultures are studied within the school system, though only one per student. When we think of the goal of multicultural studies as fostering mutual understanding and communication across cultural boundaries, this notion of multicultural H.

But the notion of multiculturalism as educating students to appreciate cultures other than their own is cross-cul- tural, and that introduces enormous problems of its own. How can the members of one cultural group ever hope to understand another culture? If we inevitably look at everything from our own cultural point of view, how can we investigate another culture except in a hopelessly ethnocentric manner? In this article I want to discuss the example of so-called "primitive art"- that is, the traditional arts of Black Africa, Precolumbian Mesoamerican Amerindian art, and the art of the South Seas. But the very term "primitive art" indicates the problem involved in any cross-cultural study-that is, the problem of using our concepts to study their culture. It is a Western cultural perspective to suppose there is an evolution of cultures from "primitive" to "advanced," and the concept of "art" in the sense of "fine art" is equally a Western designation and concept. In other words, we are studying their culture in our own terms, and since these are the only terms we have, we seem to have no choice but to be ethnocentric and therefore inaccurate and unfair. The central question of "primitive art" is therefore whether primi- tive art is "primitive" and whether it is "art." That is, what do we mean when we say this kind of art is "primitive" and what do we mean when we say it is "art"? More generally, what right do we have to impose these Eurocentric labels on non-European cultures? More important, do we have any choice-is there any alternative? In what follows we will look at the second of these two questions--Is primitive art art? Primitive art is only now beginning to be investigated as art. Until recently most serious, professional study of primitive artworks has been conducted piecemeal by treating the objects as accessories to vari- ous nonaesthetic, nonartistic societal functions. For the most part the study of primitive art is not carried out in art schools but in anthropological stud- ies of social organization, religious practices, secret societies, initiation rites, and so on. On the other hand, those who have been excited about primitive art as art are primarily Western artists from 1905 onward, whose comments have been admittedly personal and highly subjective reactions to art forms that they frankly knew little or nothing about. The anthropologists accuse the artists of ignorance of the scientific, factual basis on which such artifacts rest, and the artists blame the anthropologists for their lack of concern for these objects as works of fine art. Thus the discussion of primitive art has from the beginning been per- vaded by a curious dilemma-you can approach primitive art from an aes- thetic point of view but subjectively, or you can approach primitive art from a more objective basis but not aesthetically. What has not occurred in the case of primitive art, as has occurred with practically every other art form, is an approach that is both aesthetic and objective. When we study the</page><page sequence="3">Primitive Art 89 art of the Italian Renaissance, or the Ming Dynasty, for example, we study it scientifically as art. Why has there been so little aesthetics, art history, or art criticism of primitive art? The answer has to do with the very special nature of primi- tive art. The fact is that, in a curious way, primitive art becomes art, not through the primitive peoples who made and make such objects, but through Europeans who buy and collect it. It is not art because those who make and use it say it is, but, ironically, because we say it is. It is art by alien decree. But somehow objects designated as art only by alien decree, by out- siders only and not also by insiders, are considered art only half-heartedly and perhaps even hypocritically. It has often been said that traditional tribal art is not produced from within an "aesthetic" perspective as "fine art," as these terms are usually understood. It is often pointed out that, unlike Western art, primitive art is not made to be appreciated aesthetically, or at least not primarily aestheti- cally, from which it would seem to follow that such objects are not pro- duced as works of art. And this, in turn, is what I am suggesting leads to our reluctance to treat primitive art as art. But this merely introduces the question I want to raise in this article, Is primitive art "art"? Should we look at primitive artifacts as works of fine art, or as religious paraphernalia, or in some other way? My approach is to reject the subjective point of view of the enthusiastic Western artist in favor of the more objective standpoint of the anthropologist, but to deny the anthropologist's conclusion that there is no aesthetic dimension within the perspective of the indigenous peoples who produce and use primitive art. Thus, the anthropologists were right in their approach but wrong in their conclusions, while the opposite is true of the Western artists who were cor- rect in their assessment of the artistic character of primitive art, but wrong in their reasons for making those assessments. The problem we face is not one that is peculiar to primitive art but is a general problem affecting any cross-cultural study. Whenever group A uses A's concepts to describe group B's activities, problems of meaning arise- do we mean that this is how B looks at it or only A, or both? Until we make it clear that our description of his behavior must incorporate not only our understanding of that description but his perception of the situation as well, problems of ambiguity will inevitably arise. And since descriptive terms can seldom be adequately translated cross-culturally, especially if the two societies are very different, we always seem to be caught in something of a dilemma--either we use terms of our own language, in which case our de- scriptions are apt to be unfair and misleading in their implications, or else we do not use terms of our own language, in which case it is difficult to see how we can make ourselves understood to the group to whom we are writing (the group, that is, which speaks our language).</page><page sequence="4">90 H. Gene Blocker At first, the solution might seem fairly obvious. Since it is clearly unfair to describe their behavior in our terms, why not describe their behavior in their terms? To avoid the errors of ethnocentrism, why not describe the alien society from within their own perspective and point of view? But this will prove to be impossible for the simple and obvious reason that, as human beings, we can never escape entirely from our own point of view. The conclusion, then, is inevitable-a cross-cultural comparison is un- avoidable in any cross-cultural description; the concept must be ours while the behavior and beliefs are theirs. But how can that possibly be fair? How can any anthropological description hope to achieve the barest minimum of objectivity? Only, as we will see, if the concepts by which we describe their society and the concepts by which they describe the same things in their society are synonymous (or at least similar) in meaning. Suppose I am an early missionary to West Africa. I see people making what appear to be "sacrifices" and "offerings" and "prayers" to carved wooden figures which they call by what I have been told are the names of their "gods." Hence I am led to believe that they worship these idols, and so I write in my next report home that the natives worship pieces of wood, that these carvings are idols worshipped as gods. But this claim or interpreta- tion of mine clearly assumes that these people themselves believe that as well. Let us say that they come to my mission school and begin to learn En- glish, and, after some years, they inform me that they never consider the carving itself to be the god, but only to represent it, or to be the temporary abode of the god who can occasionally enter and occupy it. Then, assuming I believe what my informants are now telling me, I would have to admit that I had been wrong in my earlier report and to deny now that the prac- tices I had observed in connection with the wood carvings were instances of idolatry. But now if we analyze this situation, we see that it very clearly lays down as necessary conditions for correct translation of their practices into our language the following. The meaning of the term in which I describe their activity must be one which they share in the terms of their language with which they describe this same activity. If I say they worship idols, I quite clearly imply that they believe that these bits of wood are gods. But now it becomes an empirical, factual question whether this is or is not their belief. If it is not, then "idol" is not the right word to use in describing their activities. Suppose now that having been in this West African village for many years I become very attracted to the aesthetic qualities of these wooden carvings, especially as friends back home inform me that they are becoming quite valuable as artworks. If I now change my opinion as to what these objects are, rejecting the idea that they are "idols" and embracing now the idea that they are "works of art," then precisely the same problem confronts</page><page sequence="5">Primitive Art 91 me once more. By calling them "works of art" I imply that the people who make and use these objects have the same or very similar attitudes and be- liefs to those involved in the English meaning of "work of art." I imply, for example, that the people in this community enjoy looking at them, that they "use" them more for just looking at than for some more utilitarian end, that they grade and rank them according to critical standards, that they regard the objects as expressing the attitude or world view of the carver, that they respect the carver as a person of vision and originality, that they respect creativity and originality in the carving in its own right, and so on. But now I may learn that I was mistaken once again in my assumptions about the beliefs and attitudes of these people. It may turn out, for example, that they have no idea and don't care who made the pieces or that anyone and everyone makes them, that each is considered just as good as every other, that they never take the objects out just to look at them, that when they have finished with them in a religious ceremony they just throw them away, that they reject any innovation and have no conception of the carvers expressing themselves or their view of things in producing the objects, and so on. In that case I will have to conclude that they are not works of art either. But notice what I would mean by this. I do not mean that they fail to have the visible marks and features which qualify objects in my society to be artworks or that they are not good enough to be works of art. I simply mean that the people who make and use such objects do not themselves re- gard them in ways that are sufficiently similar to the ways in which native English speakers indicate they regard them by calling them "works of art." My refusal to call them works of art casts reflection more on the traditions and institutions of the people than it does on the objects themselves. To summarize, we have identified three criteria for a good cross-cultural description. To apply a concept P correctly to X from group A to group B, it must be the case that 1. X is correctly classified as P by A 2. X is correctly classified as Q by B 3. P and Q are synonymous (or at least similar in meaning). Since the ambiguity obviously turns on the cross-cultural aspect of the situation (one culture talking about another) rather than the descriptive terms themselves, our claim is not that there is an ambiguity in words like "worshipping" or "gods," though there may well be ambiguities in these words which we are not here concerned with, but that the ambiguity arises from their cross-cultural application. But clearly, not all descriptive terms applied cross-culturally are am- biguous in this sense, or at least if it turns out to be a matter of degree, all are not equally so ambiguous. If I say, as an American anthropologist ob-</page><page sequence="6">92 H. Gene Blocker serving a South American tribe, "They wear no shoes," or "They eat cooked fish," or "Their houses are built of bamboo and palm thatch," there is not the same ambiguity, or at least not the same degree of ambiguity, as when I say, "They worship many gods," or "They express their innermost thoughts in creating works of art," or "They perform plays and other theatrical dramas." What is the difference between these two types of cross-cultural descrip- tion? We might begin by noting that the less ambiguous seem to be more factual and empirical, while the more ambiguous appear more interpreta- tive and nonempirical. Secondly, the nonempirical component or aspect is an "intentional" one in the sense that the truth or falsity of its application depends on the "intentions" (i.e., the point of view, attitude, etc.) of the in- digenous agents being referred to. If I say, "They eat cooked fish," it is diffi- cult to see how the point of view, purposes, or whatever of those referred to could affect the truth or falsity of the claim. Whereas if I say, "They worship many gods," I stand to be corrected, whatever the immediate empirical evi- dence of ritualized behavior I have observed, by improved knowledge of the intentions, points of view, and so forth, of the agents. If it turns out later that this is not what they meant or intended, then my claim is defeated. In fact, ideally, controversies inevitably arising out of the "interpretive" char- acter of the more ambiguous descriptions are settled by appeal to the rep- resentative native speakers who have learned our language. Only they are able to tell us whether our word captures what they intend in performing certain acts. "No, this is not a 'drama' or 'theatrical play' in your sense of the words, but something resembling more what you call 'religious ritual,' as when your priest traces the 'stages of the cross. But, of course, we are not here talking about the personal intentions of a particular individual, but the collective intentions of a certain group. We are speaking, in other words, of institutionalized attitudes, forms of behav- ior, and patterns of perception as generated and regulated by a particular culture. Thus, in a cross-cultural description, ambiguity occurs where the accuracy of the description depends on the institutional character of the in- digenous culture. If there is an institutionalized set of theatrical conventions in their society of which this behavior is a part, then it will be true and apt to say of this behavior, "They are performing a theatrical drama." And if not, not. These institutional conventions will be assumed to govern the in- dividual intentions of particular members of that society and to be reflected in the objects and behavior that they produce. So when we speak of "the man's intentions" or "what is meant by sprinkling blood on the stone ef- figy," we are referring indirectly to the cultural conventions and institu- tions that govern those sorts of activities. Now, to test our analysis, let us consider three possible objections that might be raised against our claims, somewhat like Plato's "three waves" in</page><page sequence="7">Primitive Art 93 The Republic. The first wave is the objection that it doesn't matter what we call objects, so long as we all know what it is we are referring to. But this certainly won't do, since our entire theoretical and practical approach to such objects depends on what we call them. As noted earlier, the first Euro- peans described primitive artifacts as idols and for that reason proceeded to destroy as many of them as they could. In the nineteenth century these same objects were described as curiosities and treated accordingly, and it was only in the twentieth century that Western artists began to call these objects works of art and to treat them accordingly, that is, displaying them in art museums, collecting and discussing them artistically, and so on. The second wave, or objection, is that since we are free, especially in sci- entific discourse, to define words as we like, we ought to eschew ethnocen- trism and simply redefine our concepts in line with what we know to be the attitudes and beliefs of the people we are describing. "For them art is in- separable from life; everything they do is done with a style and grace which to them are art," or "To them art is not perceived as something to be appre- ciated in some way apart from their appreciation of its religious function; to them art need not .be appreciated aesthetically." But this approach can only add to the existing confusion. Since these words of ours (e.g., "art") already have well-established meanings, using them in new ways will only create new confusions. All we can possibly mean thereby is that what we regard in one way, they regard in another way; that what we regard as art, for ex- ample, they do not regard as art. If our concept resembles theirs, then we can extend our concept to apply to their practices and artifacts. But if their concept is known to be different from ours, then why use this particular concept of ours? Such an approach does not subsume two subconcepts under one larger concept, unless both are subconcepts of our concept. If, for example, our concept of a god included both immortal but other- wise human entities (such as Greek gods) as well as more spiritually ab- stract beings such as Allah, who have no physical characteristics or human foibles, then it would make sense to say of an alien culture, "Their gods are not like ours, high and mighty, pure spiritual beings, morally perfect, but are very energetic, often wicked, anthropomorphic beings." But it would not make sense to say, "They do not worship any gods in our sense of the word; their gods are simply individual bits of matter, such as small pebbles and twigs uninhabited by unseen forces of any kind, which they use to soften leather or to clean their teeth." This would simply be a misuse of lan- guage-as odd as one who tried to prove the existence of God by display- ing a small pebble which he had named "God." After all, it is we who select from among our own concepts the one we think most appropriate in a given situation. But why choose one concept over another? Surely it can only be on the basis of some perceived resemblance between their meaning and ours. If we know the meanings are different, this is a perfect reason to</page><page sequence="8">94 H. Gene Blocker reject that concept of ours in favor of another ("These small pebbles and twigs are not gods at all but rather household tools.") Thus, it is nonsense to claim, as is often claimed today, that different groups can and do have their own concept of "philosophy," "art," or "god." Indeed, it is widely held that within our own culture such important con- cepts can be redefined at will. Of course, concepts can and do change, and one of the reasons new meanings are often suggested as replacements for old, established meanings of the same word is to try to bring about that change. They are, as C. L. Stevenson called them, "persuasive definitions." But even so, as a factual claim about the actual meaning of the word, such definitions are quite false and mistaken. Secondly, it is up to us to accept or reject them as persuasive definitions-if enough of us are persuaded to use the terms in this new way, then the terms will gradually change in mean- ing, but if not, then the attempt at persuasion has failed. In neither case can the meaning of a word be changed simply by fiat, as the innovators would have us believe. What we can and should allow, however, are subconcepts within our own concepts, along with the possibility that the group we are investigating may have a greater affinity for a different subconcept than the subconcept that defines our own current interests. If someone calls "God" the "big bang" with which the physical universe is said to have begun, we will object that this is stretching it a bit; but if someone calls a Yoruba Orisha, such as Shango, a god, we will certainly not object since, although Shango little resembles the God of the Judeo-Chris- tian tradition in His sublime transcendent omniscience and moral perfec- tion, Shango does most certainly resemble our own subcategory of gods of the ilk of Zeus, Odin, and Shiva. And the same principle would seem to operate in the case of "art." True, our current preferred sense concerns a notion of (more or less) art for art's sake for purely or largely aesthetic interests, with emphasis on formal, sym- bolic content, and so on, in comparison with which primitive art stands out in fairly sharp contrast. But we also have other subconcepts of religious art from the Greco-Roman era, as well as European art prior to the Renais- sance, as well as the subcategory of art as a skill or craft, with which we can find far greater similarity with primitive art. The final "wave" is the objection that our insistence upon using our con- cepts in describing alien cultures amounts to a form of intellectual imperi- alism, especially as this results so often in belittling comparisons of their culture in relation to our own. But this objection rests on a confusion. The fact that the concept must be our concept implies no imperialistic superior- ity whatever, but springs simply and only from the fact that we are the speakers. If they are speaking about us, exactly the same principle applies. It is purely the logical or conceptual point that when speaker A attributes</page><page sequence="9">Primitive Art 95 some description to an alien group B, it is A's concept which determines the meaning of that description, whoever A is. If an African were to say (in his language here adequately translated), "Americans in their burial practices have insulted their ancestors and rejected their legitimate needs and wants," his remark would be equally misleading and false. Since we do not have quite the same concept of, much less belief in, the living-dead ancestor (which is not the same as either a ghost or a god), the claim makes no sense, or else is simply false. To reject our ancestors we would have to set out in- tentionally, knowing what they are, believing in them, and knowing about their needs, to refuse their demands, which we cannot do if we do not believe in, or even have the concept of, such ancestors. Nonetheless, it is hard to remove the evaluative element in any cross- cultural description, and even though describing alien cultures in our terms is not necessarily ethnocentric in itself, there is always that tendency. Be- cause any cross-cultural description involves an implied comparison be- tween our culture and theirs, cross-cultural descriptions always involve the "politics" of commendatory or derogatory comparisons. Implied in any such comparison is always the unspoken idea that their practices or beliefs will or will not match up to our own most praiseworthy concepts or that they will or will not sink to the level of our own most scorned concepts. Obviously, many of our concepts imply cultural values-to have a written language, or a science, or a complex social organization, or a developed art form, or a system of formal education-all these things are not just facts about some societies, but terms of praise for those who possess them and terms of shame for those who do not. Now, having thoroughly politicized the entire discussion, it becomes virtually impossible to avoid this evaluative ranking and simply describe these cultures in a scientific, objective manner. For now, despite one's own intentions, whatever one says will inevitably be interpreted as praising or slighting the societies under investigation. The difficulty of partial compliance is especially troublesome in the case of primitive art. Suppose we find that on balance it is mistaken to call such objects works of art, that upon closer investigation we find that, despite our own interest in such objects aesthetically and our willingness to treat them as artworks, it is simply false (or more nearly false than true) to attribute such attitudes to the people who made and used them-what then? Must we now take them out of the museums, galleries, art books, and art jour- nals? Not at all. We must simply make it clear that we are shifting to a par- tial and therefore weaker sense of "work of art" in which we, the aesthetic audience and consumer, determine the aesthetic context that qualifies the objects as works of art, rather than their makers. This would meet the first of our three criteria for a good cross-cultural description, but not the other</page><page sequence="10">96 H. Gene Blocker two. In the full sense of the word, all three criteria must be met, but the term can also be used in a partial sense involving only the first of the three criteria. This is not, of course, an entirely novel sense. We are already familiar with it in describing as art certain kinds of furniture, storage jars, eating utensils, driftwood, ordinary manufactured objects in Found and Dada art, such as hat racks, bicycle wheels, and so on. But what we must in that case reject is the idea that the makers of these objects are artists. So, even though we could continue to enjoy and discuss and collect such objects as artworks in this weakened sense, the conclusion would nonetheless have serious ramifications in the sense that it would deny to the vast majority of our fel- low human beings any aesthetic appreciation, artistic production, or critical sensibilities as regards art. It would also have the effect noted earlier of not taking the claim that these are works of art seriously. As we saw, whenever objects are designated art by alien decree they tend to be considered art only half-heartedly and somewhat hypocritically. But now, having laid out in painstaking detail the truly awesome di- mensions of the problem, let us at least suggest a solution. Is it appropriate to call African wood carvings and other examples of primitive artifacts works of art in the full sense? We have argued for a modified objectivist approach to cross-cultural studies, embodying the three criteria outlined earlier, and rejecting both the purely subjectivist approach and the purely objectivist approach. We reject subjectivist accounts which describe their culture form our point of view without regard to their point of view, ones, that is, which meet only the first of the above three criteria. But neither can we accept the purely objectivist approach of describing the matter entirely in their terms, especially when the description is being offered in our language. Thus, we must reject de- scriptions based on the second criterion alone (where Q is an expression in B's language and the description is in A's language), since this will be either unintelligible or uninteresting, or both, to the speakers of A's language in which the description is offered. In the modified objectivist approach embodied in the three criteria above, we attempt so far as possible to translate their conceptual terminol- ogy into our conceptual terminology. This involves the two-step process of finding out empirically how the indigenous society regards the phenom- enon in question and then conceptually deciding which of our concepts is the best translation into our language and conceptual framework. If I say that the carver is an artist creating an artwork, I imply, among other things, that within his society some creativity is involved in such projects, that the ob- ject will be appreciated for itself, for its beauty, that it will have some aes- thetic value apart from its immediate use, and so on--because this is what the expression "work of art" means in my language (and since I am the</page><page sequence="11">Primitive Art 97 speaker). Whether these implications are true is a matter of fact that must be determined by empirical investigation in the field. But this gives us a practical way of answering difficult cross-cultural questions, such as, "Is primitive art really art?" First we define our own concept of "art" as clearly as we can in terms of empirically observable traits (e.g., the carver is respected for his originality), and then we look to see if those empirically observable traits obtain (e.g., whether the indig- enous people praise the carver in terms of his originality, inventiveness, or not). And that brings us at last into an empirical realm where issues can be more or less decided. Having defined our own concepts in terms of various beliefs and behavioral attitudes and dispositions, our problem becomes one of looking to see if the group we are describing does or does not share the concepts in question judging by their beliefs and behavioral attitudes and dispositions. Only by moving in this way back and forth between the arm- chair and the field can we hope to answer the question, Is primitive art art? I hope it is clear by now how my discussion of the study of so-called "primitive art" illustrates what I suggested at the beginning concerning rec- ommendations for multicultural art education. First, and most important, despite all its admitted problems, we must not give up the attempt to en- courage our students to try to understand cultures other than our own, es- pecially those that have had major influences on American culture-though not limited to these. Put another way, we must not allow ourselves to be so overwhelmed by the enormous difficulties of cross-cultural understanding that we retreat into divisive and self-serving unicultural studies of Hispanic culture by Hispanic-American students, Asian studies by Asian-American students, African studies by African-American students, and so on. My proposal is to face squarely the challenges of any cross-cultural study, ad- mitting the unavoidable comparative nature of any cross-cultural study, with its inevitable and everpresent risk of ethnocentric bias, and finally to embrace what hermeneutics explains as the mutual give and take in any cross-cultural studies, whereby we open ourselves as far as possible to an alien culture which we nonetheless realize, despite our best intentions and efforts to the contrary, we are inevitably interpreting according to our own cultural bias. It is not, after all, unlike getting to know another person-we try to understand the other person from his or her unique standpoint though we know we can do this only by understanding the other person in terms of our own experience. Do we ever really know another person? Per- haps not, at least not completely; but would we want to give up the effort? In the end, what, really, is the alternative?
