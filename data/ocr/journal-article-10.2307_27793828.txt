A. Giulea Marquette University, Coughlin Hall 100, Milwaukee, WI53201, USA dragos.giulea@marquette. edu Abstract In his second theological oration (Oratio 28,3), Gregory Nazianzen equates the divine glory (kabod) of the Holy of Holies with the divine essence and asserts their inacces sible character. An investigation into the meaning of these two terms unveils their origins in two distinct traditions, the former tracing its roots back to the ancient Semitic symbolisms of the forbidden divine glory and throne, the latter to the Helle nistic philosophical conception of an immaterial and incomprehensible divinity. The thesis advanced in this study is that these two different languages represent two semi otic forms of apophaticism, one expressed through the mysterium tremendum inspiring symbols and images of fire, dazzling glory and enigmatic heavenly creatures, guardians of the enthroned kabod, the other through negative philosophical terminologies. The identity of the two semiotic forms is established at the end of an investigation that concludes with the observation that Hellenistic theologians developed their apophatic discourses mostly in the context of interpreting biblical reports on the theophanies of the divine and unapproachable enthroned kabod. It was in this hermeneutical context that they "translated" the symbols of interdiction into philosophical negative concepts. Keywords apophaticism, kabod, divine essence, symbols, concepts ?

Giulea/Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 Introduction: Nazianzen's Text and Its Twofold Background In his second theological discourse, Oratio 28,3, a passage incorporat ing a theorization about the incomprehensibility of the divine essence, Gregory Nazianzen identifies the divine essence with the biblical kabod. What experience of this have I had, you friends of truth, her initiates (mystai), her lovers (synerastai) as I am? I was running with a mind to see God and so it was that I ascended the mount (an?lthon epi to oros). I penetrated the cloud (ten nephel?n dieschon), became enclosed in it, detached from matter and material things and concentrated, so far as might be, in myself (eis emauton h s hoion te systrapheis). But when I directed my gaze (proseblepsd) I scarcely saw (eidon) the averted figure (ta opisthia) of God, and this whilst sheltering in the rock (t?petra), God the word incarnate for us. Peering in (mikron diakypsas) I saw not the nature prime (ten pr?t?n te kai ak?raton physin), self-apprehended (heaut? gin?skomen?n) (by "self" I mean the Trinity), the nature as it abides within the first veil (toupr?tou katapetas matos eis? menei) and is hidden by the Cherubim (hypo t?n cheroubim sygkalyptetai), but as it reaches us (eis hemas phthanousa) at its furthest remove from God, being, so far as I can understand, the grandeur (megaleiot?s), or as divine David calls it the "majesty" (megaloprepeia) inherent in the created things he has brought forth and governs. (Norris 1991:225; Gr. text: Gallay 1978) Two ideas seem to be emblematic within the text. First, Gregory's expo sition represents the account of a visionary's experience which follows the features of the Jewish-Christian mystical tradition of the divine ascent: a preliminary ascetical preparation for the encounter with God is followed by ascension and the whole process reaches its fulfillment in the vision of God, the theophany of the divine glory Second, the vision ary who is allowed to enter the divine temple does not experience unlimited access to every element of the temple. A particular celestial item still remains concealed in mystery and under the strictest exclu sion to the visionary's access. It is the divine glory {kabod [MT]/doxa [LXX]) which in its manifestation still remains enveloped in a mystery of interdiction.1 On the one hand, the passage asserts a dimension of 1} Several scholars argue that the main theophanic traditions of ancient Israel took two forms, depending on the nature of God's manifestation either as glory or as name; see Tryggve Mettinger's classical distinction between shem (name) and kabod (glory) the ologies (Mettinger 1982b) and Brueggemanns similar distinction between the Priestly theology of glory and the Deuteronomic theology of name (Brueggemann 2005:670 674). One may maintain that a certain apophaticism is intrinsic to the theology of the</page><page sequence="3">D. A. Giuleal Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 3 divine concealment echoing both Exod 25,20 and 37,9 (which affirm that the divine kabod/doxa is situated beneath the wings of the cheru bim) and 1 Kgs 8,7, according to which the cherubs cover the ark in Solomon's temple. On the other hand, the passage asserts a dimension of divine manifestation and recalls the concept of megaloprepeia in con nection with David.2 However, Gregory's discourse unveils further layers of complexity, as the oration is usually read as expressing the Cappadocian doctrine regarding the incomprehensibility of the divine essence or substance. Gregory, therefore, instills the Greek philosophical idea of divine incomprehensibility within the mystical and visionary context of a theophany. Thus, one of the main hypotheses I propose in this study is that philosophical apophatic discourse emerged in the context of theophanic hermeneutics and in connection with the Second Temple tradition of the forbidden element of mystical experiences. Nazianzen's passage offers a sound textual ground for this idea and shows as well that apophatic discourse undergoes a change from imagery and sym bolic forms to concepts and Greek philosophical terminology. On the one hand, therefore, Nazianzen's text harks back to the old Jewish apocalyptic writings, whether biblical or extra-biblical, which develop the theme of the inaccessible divine glory seated on the sacred throne of the Holy of Holies.3 My article advances the idea that Jewish and Christian visionary traditions conceived of a forbidden sacred object and usually identified it with the heavenly enthroned glory. Since divine name, which presupposes, as Brueggemann points out, that "Yahweh's name' (which in some sense is Yahweh's self ) is there [in the Temple], but Yahweh's full self is elsewhere, in heaven, beyond the ideological arrangements of Israel" (Brueggemann 2005:672). However, glory theology is primarily important for the economy of this article, as long as it reflects both a dimension of divine manifestation as heavenly light and a dimension of divine concealment which leads from an apophatic theology expressed through symbols to an apophatic theology through philosophical concepts. 2) The book of Psalms employs this term for denoting the majesty above the heavens (Ps 8,3), its dwelling over Israel (Ps 68,34) or within the temple (Ps 96,6), and claims that this majesty characterizes God's works (Ps 111,3) and his glory {doxa, Ps 145,5). 3) For a general perspective on the image of the divine throne, see Metzger 1985 (ancient Near East), Philonenko 1993 (from ancient Iran to rabbinic perspectives) and Eskola 2001 (New Testament and early Christianity).</page><page sequence="4">4 D. A. Giulea I Numen 57(2010) 1-29 the language was predominantly, if not exclusively, symbolic, one might characterize this discourse as apophatic theology through symbols.4 On the other hand, Nazianzens text belongs to the Hellenized Jew ish-Christian tradition and construes an apophatic theological discourse through Greek philosophical concepts. My research hypothesizes that some of the most illustrious representatives of this tradition ? Philo, the Valentinians, Irenaeus, Clement, Origen and Gregory ? developed 4) In one of her studies, Janet Soskice brings forward the following insight about the inaccessible dimension of the divine expressed through symbols: "Long before Hel lenization, the God of Israel was known as a Deity beyond human conceiving. The proliferation of imagery used by Prophets and Psalmists to denote the God of Israel is evidence, surely, not of a failure to discriminate between language literally appropriate or inappropriate to God, but to the realization that no image could be adequate to AM WHO I AM'" (Exod 3,14; Soskice 1985:77). In his research on the meaning of the divine names, Mettinger concludes that the divine names are symbols and the "inventory of symbols changed from time to time in a continuous dialogue with the challenges of experience" (1988:203). However, he adds: "God is above and beyond; the images and symbols should remain what they are: not solid prison walls, but the fragile stained-glass windows of transcendence" (1988:207). Cf. "in sacredness God will remain unfathomable" (1988:11). However, my research investigates a different aspect of the biblical apophatic discourse through symbols. While Soskice and Met tinger pointed out the divine names, I will primarily emphasize the forbidden object of the sacred realm, the divine kabod. Nevertheless, one should mention Silviu Bunta's remarkable study according to which the kabod tradition manifested two opposite sub-traditions. While both of them accept the idea of human transformation into a glorious being, the first is more ancient (however still occurring in a few texts of the late Second Temple) and admits complete human transformation into a god, the sec ond rejects human transformation into a god and leaves room only for human trans formation into a godlike figure, the image of God (Bunta forthcoming). Obviously, while the former was connected with polytheistic religious forms, the later was shaped within a monotheistic context and became the main stream of the Second Temple. I suppose that philosophical apophatic theology appeared in this second context, though apophatic theology emerged in primitive forms in the ancient Near East (and possibly other areas of the world, e.g. India [Chethimattam 1981]). As one can further see in this paper, apophatic theology in the ancient Near East took various shapes ? such as a rejection of access to immortality and divine wisdom (Mettinger 2007:60?64), ter rifying guardians impending the dethronement of the heavenly king, shem theology, interdiction to pronounce the divine Name or interdiction of any divine figuration ? and eventually evolved into refined philosophical forms regarding the impossibility to comprehend or express the divine, therefore into positions professing divine incogno scibility and ineffability.</page><page sequence="5">D. A. Giulea I Numen 57(2010) 1-29 5 it within the exegetical context of the Old Testament theophanies. Gregory's text is emblematic as long as it sets in connection and identi fies the central elements of the two traditions, namely their forbidden objects, the kabodzn? the divine essence. The Ancient Tradition of the Forbidden Enthroned Kabodx Apophatic Theology through Symbols and Images 1. The Ancient Near East: Forbidden Sacred Objects and Fearful Guardians Perhaps the most noticeable way in which the biblical reports of mysti cal experiences convey the idea of inaccessibility is through the usage of such motifs as terrifying guardian creatures or natural elements as fire, dazzling light, clouds and veils. The image of the tree of life guarded by a serpent or monstrous being was widespread in the ancient Near East. Anthropomorphic figures, for example, sometimes winged men used to stand for the divine mediators of the Sumerian culture.5 On the other hand, such divine creatures as the terrifying guardians of various for bidden objects were portrayed as monsters in the form of human headed animals such as goats, cows, bulls, lions, gryphons or eagles.6 5) Langdon mentions a bas-relief of Ur-Nammu of Ur that portrays a winged mes senger holding a jar of overflowing water (Langdon 1964:96, fig. 49). See also Trin quet (1957), de Vaux (1961) and Metzger (1985). 6) Item ND 11035 of the Iraq Museum represents two pharaoh figures facing a sacred tree as guardians (Oates 2001:171). The Ninurta Temple had two guardian figures similar to the winged lions with human head that used to guard the palace of Ashur nasirpal II (883-859 BCE) at Kalhu (Oates 2001:7). Sometimes palaces are also pro vided with guardian figures (Mclntosh 2005:28). This is also similar to the two winged bull colossi guarding the entrance to the palace of Sargon II (721-705 BCE) at Khor sabad. Behind the bull there is the representation of a winged protective deity with a bucket and cone (Nemet-Nejat 1998:209). The Metropolitan Museum of Art has also an alabaster relief from room S of the palace of Nimrud, representing two eagle-headed genii facing a sacred tree (Oates 2001:55). The motif seems to have been so popular that even one of the gates at Dur-Sharukin, the capital of Assyria built by Sargon in 717 BCE, has a winged god with a bucket and cone (Roaf 1990:184). There is also a solid bronze figurine of a winged bull centaur, most likely part of an ancient throne from the ancient kingdom of Urartu, 9th-7th c. BCE (Roaf 1990:170).</page><page sequence="6">6 D. A. Giuba I Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 For instance, the Tablet III iii, 18-20 or III v,16-17 from the epic of Gilgamesh and Huwawa (or Humbaba, for the Assyrian versions) nar rates how Gilgamesh and Enkidu fight and slay Huwawa, the guardian of the Cedar Forests, who was portrayed in these lines: "his roaring is the flood-storm, his mouth is fire, his breath is death" (Speiser 1969:79? 80). In the Mesopotamian story of Etana, this legendary king of Kish receives help from a miraculous eagle and ascends to heaven, where he undergoes the test of fighting a serpent in order to obtain the plant of life from the god Anu (Pritchard 1969:114-118). Likewise, the story of Adapa narrates the episode of the hero's encounter with two heavenly guardians, Tammuz and Gizzida, at the gate of Anu (Pritchard 1969: 101). Yet, the motif of the divine guardians is not unknown to Greek mythology, since Hercules and Jason meet monstrous beings defending the forbidden gardens of Hesperides or the golden fleece of Kolchis. Besides all these mythological examples, the kings of Egypt, Meso potamia or other ancient cultures ? envisioned as gods on earth or at least their images ? used to surround their thrones with sculptures or bas-reliefs with representations of mythical guardian creatures.7 As a result, the image of the frightening guardians of the throne, a species of inaccessible sacred object, was almost omnipresent in the ancient Near East and Greece. The focal point of this imagery consisted of the inac cessible throne and the divine or terrestrial overlord who sits on that throne surrounded by glory. The numinous element, part of a wide spread solar imagery, always appears to be linked to a mysterium tremen 7) "The Mesopotamian king was considered the gods' representative on earth. An Akkadian proverb provided the metaphor: Man is the shadow of a god, and a slave is the shadow of a man; but the king is the mirror of a god.... Unlike the Egyptian pharaons, who were regarded as gods, the kings in Babylonia and Assyria were usually considered mortals. In exceptional cases, certain kings had themselves divinized. Cultic structures similar to those of the traditional gods were built for some kings" (Nemet-Nejat 1998:217). Most likely, Nemet-Nejat makes reference to Shulgi, the second and great est king of the Ur III dynasty, 2094-2047 BCE. See also Mclntosh's opinion: "The Ur III rulers expressed their authority in traditional terms, the king controlling city-states on behalf of the gods and standing between them and the people of the land ? the accepted role of the city-state's ruler writ large, the whole empire being the estate administered by the king. The relationship between the ruler and the gods became closer when Shulgi proclaimed himself a god. Temples to his cult were maintained in every city" (Mclntosh 2005:81). Cf. Metzger (1985).</page><page sequence="7">D. A. Giulea /Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 7 dum et fascinans (e.g. Otto 1947). Socially, the whole imagery of the forbidden throne reflects a royal vocabulary and reveals a theological development in a royal socio-cultural context. However, phenomeno logically, the divinity makes itself manifest, invites to worship and com munion and, at the same time, manifests an obvious element of inaccessibility. The dichotomy hidden-manifest traces its roots back here, in the ancient times when it was expressed through a language of symbols. Yet, this dichotomy will remain an essential feature of apophatic theology even in the Hellenistic era when Jewish and Chris tian thinkers will dress it in philosophical garments. 2. The Forbidden Enthroned Kabod of the Hebrew Scripture As the cherubim play the role of guardians in Gen 3,24 and Ezek 28,14 and 16, the function may be also extended to the cherubs of the ark.8 Several passages referring to the cherubs of the Tabernacle, the Temple of Solomon (with their faces turned towards the Temple entrance) or the Second Temple (facing each other) may leave sufficient room for the interpretation according to which they represent the guardians of the ark.9 One may associate the observation that secondary heavenly beings usually perform a gesture of protection over divinities of pri mary order or such sacred objects as the tree of life (Keel 1977:21) with 8) Immediately following the episode of the fall of Adam, Yahweh intends to guard the path to the tree of life and sets a guardian at the gate of Paradise, a terrifying cherub who bears a flaming sword that turns in every direction (Iht hh rbh hmthhpkhth). The idea of guardianship present in Genesis and Ezekiel (swkhkh) is suggested by the skhkhym (protecting, overshadowing) wings of the cherubs in Exod 25,20. Further more, as several biblical scholars have shown the strong connections between the image of the garden of Paradise and that of the Temple (Weinfeld 1981:501-12; Levenson 1985:111-84), one may affirm that the tree of life plays, in the Genesis narrative, a function similar to that of the divine throne of the Temple: it represents the inacces sible object of the divine realm. The connection between the tree of paradise and the throne of Yahweh is also obvious in 1 En 24,3-4, 1 En 25,1-5, 2 En 8,3 and ApMos 22,4. The idea seems to be even more ancient as it occurs in other Semitic cultures. The old descriptions of the temple built by Gudea in Lagash, for example, portray a cosmic tree at its gate and a sacred garden inside (Largement 1960:568). 9) E.g. Exod 25,18-22 and 37,6-9; Num 7,88; 1 Sam 4,4; 1 Kgs 6 and 8; 1 Kgs 10,18-20; 2 Kgs 19,15; 1 Chr 13,6, 2 Chr 3,13.</page><page sequence="8">8 D. . Giulea / Numen 57(2010) 1-29 the fact that Exod 25,20 and 37,9 affirm that the kabod is situated beneath the wings of the cherubim. Similarly, according to 1 Kgs 8,7, the cherubim perform this gesture of protection over the ark in Solo mon's temple (Mettinger 1982b: 116).10 Hence, in addition to such functions as God's vehicle (Metzger 1985:309-367; an interpretation taking its point of departure in Ps 18,11) or heavenly hosts of Sabaoth (Mettinger 1982a and 1990:397-398, taking the point of departure from Ps 89,6-9, Isaiah 6 and the Canaanite ideas of the council of gods assembling at El's mountain dwelling), the cherubim of the two temples of Jerusalem may well be interpreted as guardians of the ark (Lands berger 1947:234; Parrot 1954:24; De Vaux 1961; Noth 1968; Cassuto 1983:335; Metzger 1993:510-512; Mettinger 1995:190). They are guardians and defenders of the sanctuary: "W?chter und Sch?tzer des Heiligtums" (Noth 1968:124). The fact that heavenly creatures play the role of sacred guardians and most likely inspire fear (Landsberger 1947:232) actually sheds light on the sacred forbidden object the cher ubim and the seraphim protect, namely the divine kabod which has to remain unapproachable in its nature. This function essentially unveils an apophatic discourse expressed through symbols. A common feature of prophetic discourses, the inaccessible throne is the place where the enormous, magnificent and glorious image of Yah weh dwells guarded by heavenly creatures such as the cherubim and the seraphim.11 The tension between the vision of the divine face and the idea of divine concealment represented a central feature, if not the most important, of biblical theology. The ancient Jewish polemics concern ing divine concealment and revelation, hiddenness and manifestation prove it sufficiently.12 Yahweh's manifestations are not complete, but 10) See note 8. It is noteworthy that several Christian authors preserved the remarkable exegetical tradition of Isa 6,2 according to which the two seraphim cover the body of God (see further the subchapter on Origen). n) E.g., Isa 6,2, Ps 47,8, Jer 14,21, Ezek 1,26 and 10,1 (ks) or Daniel 7 (krs'); cf. Metzger (1985) or McCormick (2006:175-186). Under the name of merkabah (the chariot-throne), the throne will become the main target of the later apocalyptic jour neys and its location the heavenly Temple (see, for instance, Gruenwald 1980). 12) See Isa 6,5: "Then I said, 'Woe is me! I am doomed, for my own eyes have seen the King, Lord of Hosts, I, a man of unclean lips, I, who dwell among a people of unclean lips.'" Unless otherwise noted, all biblical citations are from the Oxford Study Bible. See also Exod 33,20 and Exod 3,6: "Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at</page><page sequence="9">D. A. Giulea/Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 9 fractional and curtailed, camouflaged by cherubs and seraphs, clouds, smoke and flaming fire, and the realm beyond all these elements of concealment remains intangible.13 The image of Yahwehs throne sur rounded by seraphim as guarding creatures appears in Isa 6,1-2 in the following manner: In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord seated on a throne (ks), high and exalted, and the skirt of his robe filled the temple. Seraphim were in attendance of him. Each had six wings: with one pair of wings they covered their faces and with another their bodies, and with the third pair they flew. In Ezek 1,4-10, the guardians are cherubim: In my vision I saw a storm-wind (rwh s'rh) coming from the north, a vast cloud ( hn) with flashes of fire ( s) and brilliant light (ngh) about it; and within was a radiance like brass, glowing in the heart of the flames. In the fire was the likeness of four living creatures (hywht) in human form. Each had four faces and each four wings; their legs were straight, and their hoofs were like the hoofs of a calf, glisten ing and gleaming like bronze. Under the wings on each of the four sides were human hands; all four creatures had faces and wings, and the wings of one touched those of another. They did not turn as they moved; each creature went straight forward. This is what their faces were like: all four had a human face and a lion's face on the right, on the left the face of an ox and the face of an eagle_ 26-28: Above the vault over their [the living creatures'] heads there appeared, as it were, a sapphire in the shape of a throne (ks), and exalted on the throne (ks') a form in human likeness (dmwth kmrh 'dbm). From his waist upwards I saw what might have been brass glowing like fire ( s) in a furnace; and from his waist downwards I saw what looked like fire (s). Radiance (ngh) encircled him. Like a rainbow in God." Cf. Ezek 1,27. See Mettinger (1982b) for the idea that kabod theologies empha size Yahwehs manifestation as glory {kabod), and that it was primarily developed in priestly milieus. In opposition to this maximalist position about God's manifestation, name {shem) theology ? developed in scribal environments ? was more reserved and primarily underlined Yahwehs non-visual manifestations. Balentine concludes in this way his study on the hiddenness of Yahweh: "What calls for chief mention here is that fact that the experience of God's hiddenness, just as the experience of his presence, is an integral part of Israelite faith. Both experiences derive from the nature of God him self. He is both hidden and present, both near and far way" (Balentine 1983:172; cf. 175). 13) See, for example, some of the most ancient texts, Isa 4,5; 6,1-2; 14,13-14.</page><page sequence="10">10 D. A. Giulea / Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 the clouds after the rain was the sight of that encircling radiance (ngh sbyb); it was like the appearance of the glory of the Lord (kbhwdh yhwh).u The book of Ezekiel proposes even a new depiction of the throne, now provided with wheels, an image later called the merkabah, the chariot throne. The Hebrew Bible also exhibits other types of forbidden objects, such as the fire of God,15 the name of God (sm; Exod 6,3), the face of God (pnym; Exod 33,20), Mount Horeb (Exod 3,5) or the untouch able ark of the covenant (2 Sam 6,6-7: 'rwn). Generally, the dichotomy "hidden vs. manifest" seems to represent a pivotal feature of the holy writ. Usually expressed by two connected symbols ? "cloud" vs. kabod, "smoke" vs. kabod, shem vs. kabod, Gods "face" vs. hidden God, etc. ? the structure denotes at the same time the divine concealment and various degrees of divine manifestation.16 Consequently, there is an emblematic distinction between God's hidden dimension and his vari ous modalities of manifestation in the visible world. In order to express this distinction, ancient writers employed their "primitive" but techni cal symbolic languages. 3. Apocalyptic Literature and the Idea of Forbidden Glory Although initiating a new method or practice of accessing the divine temple, the vast corpus of apocalyptic literature still preserves the image of the throne of Yahweh as the unapproachable object par excellence. Marta Himmelfarb observes that, dissimilar to prophetic writings, apocalyptic literature highlights ascension as the key method of access to the divine temple, Enoch being the first character of Jewish literature to ascend to heaven.17 Unlike Enoch and many other apocalyptic ,4) See also the similar four great beasts which Daniel sees before the Ancient of Days in Dan 7,2-10. 15) E.g. Exod 3,2-6, Moses' vision on Sinai or any prophetic vision; cf. Lk 12,49; Acts 2,3. 16) For the Hebrew Scriptures, see for example Lewis (1972), Neher (1972), Balentine (1983), Perdue (2000), Fiddes (2002), Richter (2002), Brueggemann (2005:333 407). For the New Testament, see Rouquette (1971). For the rabbinic period, see Sch?fer (1991). For a methodological perspective, see Ricoeur (1977). 17) In one of her books, Himmelfarb affirms: "The first ascent to heaven in Jewish lit</page><page sequence="11">D. A. GiulealNumen 57 (2010) 1-29 11 visionaries, the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel do not ascend to heaven in order to attain their visto Dei. To the contrary, Enoch experiences an ascension to heaven, is transported to the Garden of God ? now in a grandiose remake after the book of Genesis ? and contemplates both the "mouth of the rivers" mentioned in Genesis (the water source of all rivers of the world) and the origins of the winds (1 En 17,4-18,5). Nevertheless, the forbidden object still remains the heavenly throne, as one can see in 1 En 14,18-22, a passage explaining that Enoch and the angels cannot look at the glorious face of the divine figure encircled by flaming fire:18 And I was looking and I saw a lofty throne; and its appearance was like ice, and its wheels were like the shining sun, and the voice (or sound) of the cherubim, and from beneath the throne issued rivers of flaming fire. And I was unable to see. The Great Glory sat upon it; his apparel was like the appearance of the sun and whiter than much snow. No angel could enter into this house and look at his face because of the splendor and glory, and no human could look at him. Flaming fire encircled him and a great fire stood by him, and none of those about him approached him. (Nickelsburg and Vanderkam 2004:35) An interesting theological feature consists of the psychological state which the vision of the divine figure produces within the visionary. It is the tremendum experienced at the vision of the celestial fire, which secures the impenetrability of the lofty throne of glory and generates fear and awe. It may be observed in 1 En. 14,13-14: "And I went into that house ? hot as fire and cold as snow, and no delight of life was in it. Fear enveloped me, and trembling sized me, and I was quaking and trembling, and I fell upon my face" (Nickelsburg and Vanderkam 2004:35).19 erature appears in a third-century BCE apocalypse that has as its hero the biblical patriarch Enoch" (Himmelfarb 1986:145). She also adds: "But / Enoch 14 departs from the pattern of Ezekiel 1 in one particularly significant way. Ezekiel is the only one of all the classical prophets to record the experience of being physically transported by the spirit of God (Ezek 3,12; 8,3; 11,24; 40,1-2), but even Ezekiel does not ascend to heaven. The throne of God comes to him while he is standing by the river Kebar (Ezek 1,3). Enoch's is the first ascent in Jewish literature" (Himmelfarb 1986: 150). See also Collins (1984), Collins and Fishbane (1995) and Carmignac (1989). 18) Cf. 2 En 22,1-4, 4 Ezra 8,21-22 or Ladjac 2,7. 19) Another apocalyptic text, the famous passage from Dan 7,2-10, also displays the</page><page sequence="12">12 D. A. Giulea I Numen 57(2010) 1-29 4. The Forbidden Kabod of the New Testament The theme of the forbidden object is also encountered in the New Tes tament, for example in the episode of the Transfiguration. While climb ing Mount Tabor, Jesus guides and initiates his disciples into a spiritual ascension which ends with the vision of the Son of Man in glory.20 The text also mentions two perhaps frightening elements which accompany the revelation event ? the cloud of light and the divine voice (Matt 17,1?5). The element which proves the existence of a tremendum and of a sacred forbidden object, an element usually encountered in biblical theophanies, is the disciples' complete prostration on their faces (Matt 17,6). This act is an imitatio of the ancient prophetic gesture made at the moment when the visionary undertakes the experience of a divine manifestation, a theophany21 The same gesture of prostration also occurs in the book of Revelation and most likely it is the sign that the visionary experiences a terrifying fear, a mysterium tremendum. The account of the visionary is illustrative: When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though I were dead man (epesa pros tous podas autou h s nekros).

I am the first and the last, I am the living One' (Rev 1,17). images of certain fearful creatures, four great beasts {hywth), right before the appear ance of God seated on a throne of flaming fire. For the idea that the vision of the heavenly throne represents a mysterium tremendum etfascinans, see also 4Ezra 8,21-22 ("[Y]our throne is beyond imagining, your glory past conceiving; you are attended by the host of angels, trembling as they turn themselves into wind or fire at your bid ding") and Adam's vision in Vita 25,2-3: "After your mother and I had been driven out of Paradise, while we were praying, Michael the archangel and messenger of God came to me. And I saw a chariot {currum) like the wind and its wheels {rotai) were fiery. I was carried off into the Paradise of righteousness, and I saw the LORD sitting and his appearance {aspectus) was unbearable flaming fire {ignis incendens intolerabilis)" (Johnson 1983:267-8). 20) For the early Christian conceptions of Jesus as the Son of Man enthroned in glory as the heavenly King, see Eskola (2001). 21) The same gesture occurs in the following theophanic moments: Gen 18,2 (Abra ham in front of the three visitors at the oak of Mamvri), the Israelites in Exod 33,10; cf. Ezek 1,28 and 43,3; 1 En 14,14; Dan 8,18 and 10,15; ApZeph 6,4-7 and 13-15; Z/L?26,l;andRev 1,17.</page><page sequence="13">D. A. Giulea ?Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 13 Among the many visions of the New Testament, Rev 4,6 reports the epiphany of the four guardian creatures in a curious arrangement which disguises the divine throne, namely "in the center, round the throne itself."22 Again, the image of the guardian beasts appears connected to, covering and protecting the forbidden heavenly throne and the divine figure seated on the throne. As a witness for the persistence of the bibli cal image of the guarded throne in early Christian writings, the acts narrating the martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicitas, chapter 12, are one of many examples of this kind. There, Saturus, one of the martyrs, has this vision of the martyrs' ascent to the divine throne: Then we came to a place (locum) whose walls seemed to be constructed of light (de luce). And in front of the gate stood four angels (ante ostium loci illius angeli quat tuor stabant), who entered in and put on white robes. We also entered and we heard the sound of voices in unison chanting endlessly: 'Holy, Holy, Holy!7 In the same place we seemed to see an aged man (sedentem quasi hominem canuni) with white hair and a youthful face (uultu iuuenili), though we did not see his feet (cuius pedes non uidemus). On his right and left were four elders (seniores), and behind them stood other aged men (seniores complures stabant). Surprised (cum admiratione), we entered (introeuntes) and stood (stetimus) before a throne (ante thronum): four angels lifted us up and we kissed the aged man and he touched our faces with his hand. (Musurillo 2000:121) From the Forbidden Kabod to the Incomprehensible Divine Essence: Apophatic Theology through Philosophical Negative Concepts Hellenistic culture gradually imposed a philosophical translation of the idea of divine inaccessibility. In this way, apophatic theology changed its symbolic expression for philosophical concepts. The fact that Hel lenistic Jewish and Christian theologians articulated their apophatic theologies in the context of interpreting the theophanies of the biblical and extra-biblical texts, especially the account of Moses' vision on Mount Sinai, is a strong argument for this translation and an explanation of the way it took place. 22) See also Rev 4,6: "In the center, round the throne {en mes? tou thronou kai kykl? tou thronou), were four living creatures..."

Philo While certain anti-anthropomorphic stances are already present in Aristobulus, Philo is the real initiator of the apophatic theology in its proper sense (Wolfson 1947:121-158 and M?hlenberg 1966:58-64). As eminent scholars such as Dani?lou and Starobinski-Safran observed, Philo developed his apophatic terminologies several times within the exegetical context of biblical theophanies, for example the apparition of God to Moses or to Abraham (Starobinski-Safran 1978:55; Dani?lou 1961:298-327). However, it is worth noting that Philo lives centuries after the shem vs. kabod polemics and makes use of both traditions in order to elaborate his apophatic discourse.23 In De Somniis I 230, for instance, he makes the following statement: Thus in another place, when he [Moses] had inquired whether He that is has any name (ei esti ti tou ontos onoma), he came to know full well that He has no proper name (kyrion men ouden), and that whatever name anyone may use of Him he will use by licence of language (legesthai gar ou pephyken); for it is not the nature of Him that is to be spoken of, but simply to be (monon einai to on). (Colson and Whitaker, Philo V, LCL 275:419)24 Instead of describing the dazzling light of God or asserting the im possibility of seeing the divine face, Philo affirms, on the one hand, that any predication is improper to God as long as God s essence (ousia or physis) is incomprehensible and no name can appropriately express it. While speculating on the meaning of the divine Name, the Alexan drian suggests that God cannot have names, but the Name, the sacred Tetragrammaton (YHWH) revealed in the theophany described in 23) In Confi AG, for example, Philo calls the First-Born at the same time with shem vocabulary (onoma theou kai logos) and also with terminology particular to the kabod tradition: the "Man after His Image" (ho kat' eikona anthr?pos). 24) Cf. Mut 7-15 (e.g. Mut 7,1-2: m? ment i nomis?s to on, ho esti pros al?theian on, hyp anthr?pou tinos katalambanesthai) and Mos. I 75: "there is no name that can properly be assigned to me (ouden onoma toparapan ep'emou) (Yonge 2002:466);" cf. Colson's translation: "no name at all can properly be used of Me" (Colson, Philo VI, LCL 289:315). It is worth noting that, in all these instances of negative theology, Philo explains to his reader the meaning of Moses' vision.</page><page sequence="15">D. A. Giulea I Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 15 Exodus 3.25 Philo also renders the ineffable YHWH through ho ?n, the One Who Is, and identifies it with the being itself {to on),26 which is ineffable: arr?ton gar to on {Her 170; cf. Mut 14). For Philo, "I am that I am" is rather a matter of existence than predication. It is "equivalent to saying, 'It is my nature to be, not to be described by names {'ego eimi ho ?n y ison t? einai pephyka, ou legesthai [Mut ll,3-4])."27 Unlike this concealed dimension of God, his external manifestation, his ek-stasis {hyparxis) or active power {dynamis), represents a knowable, accessible dimension.28 Philo translates in this way, through the distinction ousia hyparxis, the ancient biblical dichotomy between the hidden and the manifest dimensions of the divine. 2. Gnostics Gnostic theologians as well have to be mentioned for their effort of expressing God through philosophical concepts. As in Philo's case, they practice a mixed discourse, at the same time symbolic and conceptual (Morray-Jones 2002: 138-46, 170). A Valentinian Exposition 24,36 25,39, for example, describes God as inconceivable and ineffable, and construes an apophatic discourse in connection with Temple theophanic imagery: Thus it is he who revealed himself in Monogenes, and in him he revealed the Inef fable One (patsege araf).. .the Truth. [They] saw him [dwelling] in the Monad [and] in the Dyad [and ] in the Tetrad. [He] first brought forth [Monogenes] [and Limit (horos)]. And Limit (hows) [is the separator] of the All [and the confirma tion of the All], since they are... the hundred_He is the [Mind (nous)]... the Son. [He is] completely [ineffable (ouatsege araf)] to the All, and he is the 25) Exodus 3 recounts the story of Moses' ascent on the mount Horeb, his vision of the burning bush and his dialogue with God about his Name, the moment in which God reveals his sacred Name, YHWH (Exod 3,14). 26) For the translation of the Tetragrammaton through ho ?n, see e.g. OpifYJI; Leg all III 181; Det 160, Mut 11, Mos I 75. Cf. LXX: Ego eimi ho ?n. In fact, ho ?n is a personalization of to ?n, while preserving the ineffable character of to ?n; they are actually identical, as one can see in Mut 7-14, Som I 230 et al. 27) Cf. Mos I 75-76: ouden onoma to parapan ep' emou kyriologeitai, h? mono prosesti to einai. 28) Cf. Post 168-9; Deus 62; Fug 165; Spec I 32-40; Virt 215; Mos II 99-100.</page><page sequence="16">16 D. A.

(Turner 1990:111-3)29 The text seems to display two levels of apophaticism: one regarding the Father, the other regarding the Son. First, the Valentinians make use of various symbols and concepts in order to underline the absolute apophatic dimension of the Father from the perspective of a created being. They primarily portray him as the "Monad" {monas: Val Exp 22,24 and 23,20) and "the Ineffable One {piatsege araf) who dwells in the Monad" {ValExp 22,20-1). Second, there is another level of apophaticism, the one regarding the Son. The idea might not be obvious at first sight, since the Son receives such positive attributes or names as the Monogenes, the Mind or the High Priest. Nevertheless, he is also called the "Ineffable One" {patsege araf), a title which rather regards his hidden, apophatic dimension akin to the ineffable Father. Similarly, it is only the Son who can pass over the "Limit {hows)I" the "Veil {katapetasmd)" or the "Silence {sige}."30 While the hows seems to denote an element similar to the biblical fir mament and a boundary which separates the multiplicity of creation from its creator,31 the Veil makes reference to the Jewish curtain of the Temple, the katapetasma that separates the Holy Chamber of the Tern 29) See also Thomassen's and Meyer's translation: "Therefore, it was himself that he revealed in the Only One, and through him he revealed the ineffable... [They] saw him residing in Oneness, in Twoness, and in Four, bringing forth the Only One and the [Boundary]. And the Boundary... [separated] the All... is totally ineffable to the All, and the confirmation and actualization [hypostasis] of the All, the veil of [silence]. He is the [true] High Priest, the [one who has] the authority to enter the Holy of Holies, revealing the glory to the aeons and bringing forth the abundant wealth to &lt;fragrance&gt;" (Thomassen and Meyer 2007:668). 30) The text does not appear to profess an apophaticism of the Father from the perspec tive of the Son, who seems to enjoy the full knowledge and vision of the Father. The Son's portrayal as High Priest, the only person allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, might also be viewed as a metaphor regarding the absolute apophaticism of the Father from the perspective of created beings, such as angels and humans. 31} Apparently there are two limits, one above the Pleroma, separating it from the Depth (bythos, i.e., the Father) and one below the Pleroma, separating it from the exiled Sophia (Pagels 1990:99; Quispel 1947:44).</page><page sequence="17">D. A. Giulea/Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 17 pie from the Holy of Holies, now in a celestial-metaphorical version.32 The Son as High Priest and Monogenes is the only one able to cross the limit or the border between the manifested and un-manifested realms. On the one hand, as Monogenes and Mind of all, he reveals the Father to all; as High Priest, on the other, he can proceed into the opposite direction entering the Holy of Holies and knowing the unknowable Father. 3. Irenaeus of Lyons Irenaeus undertakes a similar articulation of an apophatic discourse in his commentaries on the visions of the prophets, especially the theoph anies that Moses experienced. It is particularly worth noting that Ire naeus observed the opposing theological positions regarding the possibility of a visto Dei in Exodus 33 and Deuteronomy 5, both related to Moses.33 His interpretation, however, was not that the two passages come from two different ancient theological milieus, most likely in polemic with each other. Irenaeus' interpretative solution, announced in the first lines of Adversus Haereses IV 20,1, was that the two passages were not contradictory, but reflected the hidden and manifest dimensions of the divine. God is neither comprehensible nor incom prehensible, but he is both at the same time, comprehensible and incomprehensible, visible and invisible: As regards His greatness, therefore, it is not possible to know God, for it is impos sible that the Father can be measured (secundum magnitudinem non est cognoscere Deum; impossibile estenim mensurari Patrem); but as regards His love (dilectionem) (for this it is which leads us to God by His Word), when we obey Him, we do always learn that there is so great a God (semper discimus quoniam est tantus Deus), 32) Its Hebrew name wasparokhet, as one may see in Exod 26,31-35; 40,21-26 (LXX has katapetasma); cf. Matt 27,51, Mk 15,38; Lk 23,45; Heb 6,19 and 9,3 for the use of the Greek word in the New Testament writings, and especially Heb 6,19 for the idea of celestial veil and Jesus as High Priest. 33) See Exod 33,20: "My face you cannot see, for no mortal may see me and live." and Deut 5,24: "The Lord our God has indeed shown us his glory and his great power, and we have heard his voice from the heart of the fire: today we have seen that people may still live after God has spoken with them." Cf. Exod 24,9-11. In fact, Exod 33,11 advances the opposite position: "The LORD used to speak with Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another..."</page><page sequence="18">18 D. A. Giulea /Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 and that it is He who by Himself has established, and selected, and adorned, and contains all things [...] (ANF 1:487). The same formulation comes out a few pages further, in IV 20,5-6, where Irenaeus displays the two opposing biblical passages and advances the theological rationales for his solution. He first maintains that the Father comprehends all and cannot be comprehended by anything, including the mind. According to his greatness (magnitudo [Lat] / megethos [Gr]), God is neither encapsulated nor confined [incapabilis I ach?r?tos) by anything else, nor comprehended (incomprehensibilis I akatal?ptos)\ he is invisible (invisibilis I aoratos) and beyond investiga tion, inscrutable (investigabilis I anexichniastos). But he also leaves room for the accessible divine dimension, which depends on the divine dispensation, namely on God's love (dilectio), kindness (humanit?s) and goodness (benignitas I agathot?s\ Haer IV 20,5). Nevertheless, Irenaeus adds that divine goodness itself, though accessible as a dispensation through which human beings may see God, is ineffable (inenarrabilis I anex?g?tos; Haer IV 20,5). 4. Clement of Alexandria Clement develops a negative theology as well in connection with the theophany which Moses experienced on Sinai, as the following passage from Stromateis II 2,6,1 illustrates: As a result, Moses, convinced that God will never be known (oupote gn?sth?sesthai) to human wisdom, says, "Reveal yourself to me," and finds himself forced to enter "into the darkness" where the voice of God was present; in other words, into the unapproachable (adytous), imageless (aeideis), intellectual concepts (ennoias) relat ing to ultimate reality (peri tou ontos). For God does not exist in darkness. He is not in space at all (en gnoph? ? topo). He is beyond space and and time and any thing belonging to created beings (hyperan? kai topou kai chronou kai t?s t?n gegonot?n idiot?tos). Similarly, he is not found in any section (oud' en merei). He contains nothing. He is contained by nothing (periech?n ou periechomenos). He is not subject to limit (horismon) or division (apotom?n). (Ferguson 1991:160-1) However, Clement does not profess agnosticism in regard to God, but he deems that while God's essence (ousia) remains inaccessible, hidden and ineffable, the human mind can access the divine manifested power (dynamis) and works (ergo):</page><page sequence="19">D. A. Giuleal Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 19 For human speech (logos) is by nature feeble, and incapable of uttering God (ady natos phrasal theon)_Nor (do I say) His essence (pude ten ousian); for this is impossible (adynaton), but the power and the works of God (t?n dynamin kai ta erga tou theou) (Strom. VI 18,166; ANF 2: 519).34 5. Origen For Origen, as for the aforementioned theologians, hermeneutical exer cise on biblical theophanies represents an opportunity to speculate philosophically about the possibility of knowing God. Polemicizing with the defendants of the idea of divine corporeality, he starts his argu mentation in De principiis with the biblical episode about the theoph any Moses saw on Sinai. The hermeneutical process offers to the Alexandrian the opportunity of displaying his philosophical assump tions. According to him, "nothing can be seen except by help of form, and size, and color, which are special properties of bodies {Non enim aliter videri quid potest nisi per habitum et magnitudinem et colorem, quae sunt specialia corporum\ De prin II 4,3)." Corporeality, therefore, refers to sensible and created material things. To the contrary, God is incomprehensible, immeasurable, uncreated, immaterial, and seeing him represents pure impossibly {Deprin I 1,5). One of the most interesting Origenian passages may be found in his Commentary on Isaiah I 1-3, where he offers a Trinitarian interpreta tion of the Isaian vision of Yahweh inside the temple. The two seraphim protect mortal eyes from the astounding light of the character sitting on the throne. It is noteworthy that the Hebrew and Greek versions of Isa 6,2 are vague enough not to clarify whether the seraphim cover their own faces or the face of God. However, some ancient rabbinic documents support the former idea,35 while Origen and other authors 34) See also H?gg (2006:154-79, for the idea of apophaticism developed in the Mid dle-Platonist intellectual milieu, and page 161 for the context of interpreting Moses' vision on Sinai; see pages 238-51, for the distinction between ousia and dynamis). 35) The interpretation goes back to the rabbinic traditions of Midrash ascribed to R. Jacob b. Zadbi as one can see, for instance, in Midrash Rabbah-Lev 27,3: "It is writ ten, Above Him stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he didfly (Isa 6,2). 'With twain he did fly for the purpose of offering praise, And with twain he covered his face' in order not to look at the Shechinah, And with twain he covered his feet' that they might not be exposed to the view of the Shechinah, for it is written, And the sole of their feet was like</page><page sequence="20">20 D. . Giulea/Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 maintain the latter.36 Origen not only sustains that the seraphim con ceal the face of God, but he also makes known to us the meaning of their gesture. As God is not corporeal ? one of Origen's main theo logical tenets ? covering the face of God actually signifies that our knowledge of God's beginning is pure impossibility: Operiebant faciem Dei.y Exordium enim Dei ignotum est. Moreover, as the seraphim cover God's feet as well, God's end is also beyond human understanding: 'Sed et pedes. ' Novissimum enim quod in Deo nostro esty non comprehenditur (Horn Isa I 2; PL 24, 904A).37 In conclusion, no one can comprehend the origins of the uncreated, no one can comprehend God, and neither Moses, nor Isaiah was able to see the divine Face. 6. Gregory Nazianzens Mysticism as Apophatic Theology Before analyzing Nazianzens text, I would first underline his predeces sors' accomplishments. The examples analyzed above may lead to the hypothesis of the existence of two types of language ? one symbolic and one conceptual ? having an almost identical purpose, namely to express the idea that God's core is inaccessible and no one can know what it is. While the old symbolic texts made use of the imagery of fire, dazzling light, clouds, human-headed lions, bulls, eagles, cherubim and seraphim in order to express the impossibility of accessing the divine kabod, Philo, the Valentinians, Irenaeus, Clement, Origen and Nazian zen construed an apophatic theology through philosophical terminol the sole of a calf s foot (Ezek 1,7)" (Freedman and Simon 1961:345). See also Targum fohnathan on Isa 6,2: "Holy ministers stood in the height before him: each one had six wings; with twain he was covering his face that he might not see, and with twain he was covering his body that it might not be seen, and with twain he was ministering" (Stenning 1953:20). Cf. Tbe Oxford Study Bible 1992:708, n.2. 36) Origen offers the same Trinitarian interpretation of Isa 6,2 in De prin I 3,4 and IV 3,14. While he expressly points out that this idea belongs to his "Hebrew teacher," in I 3,4 he mentions the interpretation in connection with the book of the Ascension of Isaiah, a Christian document of the second century. It is interesting to see that Gregorys passage cited at the beginning of this article (i.e., Or 28,3, although based on Exod 25,20; 37,9 and 1 Kgs 8,7) mentions the cherubim who hide the kabod. 37) See also the same interpretation of Isa 6,2 in Horn Isa IV 1 (PL 24, 912D-913C) in which he advances the idea that humans can know only the middle ? i.e., the world and its history ? but not the beginning and the end (i.e. the face and feet) of God, which only the Son and the Holy Spirit know.</page><page sequence="21">D. . Giulea ?Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 21 ogy. Moreover, the aforementioned theologians elaborated the apo phatic philosophical language predominantly within the exegetical context of the Old Testament theophanies of the kabod, therefore as a sort of "translation" of the apophatic theology through symbols. With Nazianzen, we encounter not only the two apophatic languages and traditions ? the symbolic and the conceptual ? linked together as in Philo, the Valentinians, Irenaeus, Clement and Origen, but he also equates the central elements of the two languages, namely the heavenly kabod and the divine essence. According to him, the reality dwelling beyond the heavenly katapetasma, on the one hand, and the concept of the divine essence, on the other, are the same item. It is noteworthy that the passage from Oratio 28,3 given in the introduction of this article is not a hapax legomenon of the Cappadocian. To the con trary, Gregory expresses the same thought in Oratio 38,8 (PG 36, 320BC), a passage where he comments on the oracles God gave to Moses on the Mount (38,7), and affirms that the divine nature (physis) or the Godhead {theot?td) is the Holy of Holies which remains hidden even from the seraphim and is glorified with a trice repeated Holy {ta Agia t?n agi?ny ha kai tots seraphim sygkalyptetaiy kai doxazetai trisin agiasmois).38 The fragment obviously recalls Isa 6,2-3 and, through the expression "the Holy of Holies," actually denotes the divine kabod Isa iah contemplated in the temple rather than the holiest room of the temple. Nazianzens passage from Oratio 28,3 may be seen, on the one hand, as a Jewish or Christian ascent, in which the visionary undertakes a prior preparation and then has the vision of the heavenly temple. To a certain extent, it may be seen as proto-Hekhalot mysticism. However, Gregorys discourse may rather be seen as part of a Moses/kabod tradi tion, which plays a central role in Philos and Gregory of Nyssas mysti cal theologies and also in those of the aforementioned authors.39 The fact is suggestive, since Moses' tradition is mostly a priestly and kabod tradition and Christian theologians appear to be strong supporters of a kabod-type theology, a theology about the glory and light of God. Nazianzen himself follows Moses' paradigm: "I was running with a 38) The same formulation can be found in Or 45 A (PG 36, 628D-629A). 39) See Philo s De Vita M?sts and Gregory of Nyssas treatise with the same title, De Vita Mosis. Nazianzen himself mentions Moses by name a few lines later.</page><page sequence="22">22 D. A. Giulea/Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 mind to see God and so it was that I ascended the mount." In addition to this, Neoplatonic echoes are also present in the text. Gregory sepa rates himself from matter and material things and this process is accom panied by introspection and withdrawal into himself (eis emauton h s hoion te systrapheis) .40 The step which follows these preparatory ascetical stages of ascension and introspection is vision: "I directed my gaze (proseblepsd) I scarcely saw (eidon)P Once again he recalls the biblical terminology of the Sinai theophany. The divine disclosure is identical with that of Sinai, where Moses saw not the face of God, but the "averted figure," "the back parts of God" (ta opisthia)}1 Furthermore, the presence of glory entails an obvious element of danger: Moses had to protect himself in the cleft of a rock, which Nazianzen identifies in his case with the Logos made flesh. In fact, the partes posteriores Dei and the rock are elements of divine concealment and Gregorys next gesture ? "bending a little" (mikron diakypsas) from his shelter towards the source of glory? uncov ers at the same time an element offascinans and the fact that he realizes that the partes posteriores are not the ultimate purpose of the vision. And at that very moment he sees "the grandeur (megaleiot?s), or as divine David calls it the "majesty" (megaloprepeid)."42 Some Isaianic echoes may be heard at this stage as well, since Gregory sees the divine majesty filling the whole earth, as in Isaiah's vision, though now re-interpreted as the "majesty inherent in the created things he [God] has brought forth and governs." In addition, Gregory makes 40) See also Plotinus' similar separation from all external things, interiorization, sojourn in the divine and vision of a marvelous beauty in Enneads IV 8, 1. 41) Cf. LXX, Exod 33,23: ta opis? mou, which OSB and NRSV render through "my back." In fact a metaphor of concealment strongly connected with the theology of the divine face and glory, it will be later used in Christian visionary documents as Fossum has shown (Fossum 1995:95-108). 42) Aristobulus, the famous Alexandrian Jew of the second century BCE, used the same term, "majesty" (megaleiot?s), in order to designate the immense, un-consuming divine fire that Moses saw on Sinai (Eus. PE Vili 10,17). One may suppose that the term became quasi-technical and denoted the biblical terms kabod and doxa. 2 Pet 1,16-17, while describing the light which the disciples saw in the theophanic episode of Jesus transfiguration on Mount Tabor, employs similar terms as Gregory, namely megaleiot?s and megaloprep?s doxa. For a scholarly discussion on this theme, see Fossum 1999:351.</page><page sequence="23">D. A. Giulea/Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 23 the semiotic turn to Greek philosophical terminology into which he translates the biblical symbolic account. Thus, the reality which "abides within the first veil and is hidden by the Cherubim" is nothing else than "the first and unmitigated nature (t?n pr?t?n te kai ak?raton physir?)" From an epistemological perspective, God's nature is incomprehensible to the human mind and, of course, known solely by the divine persons of the Trinity: "self-apprehended (beaut? gin?skomen?n) (by 'self I mean the Trinity)." While Gregory experiences the vision of the majesty of God (the light which God makes manifest to the human mind), the nature of God remains unmitigated and concealed by the heavenly veil and the wings of the cherubim. Gregory continues in the next lines by affirming that even if a vision ary were holier than Moses and Paul (Gregory's visionary models, Paul being recalled because of his ascension to the third heaven), it would still be impossible to have more knowledge of God: For were a thing all heavenly, all super-celestial even, far more sublime in nature (physin) than ourselves, far nearer God, its remoteness from him and from his perfect apprehension (teletas katal?pse?s) is much greater than its superiority to our low, heavy compound. (Norris 1991:226) He defends therefore the strict transcendence of the divine nature. More than that, the next chapter of the oration, Oratio 28,4, is even more philosophical, since Nazianzen becomes interested in the ques tions regarding God's definition and apprehension, as well as regarding the capacity of language to express such an abstract subject: So we must begin again with this in mind. To know (no?sa?) God is hard, to describe him impossible (phrasai de adynaton), as a pagan philosopher taught ? subtly suggesting, I think, by the word "difficult" his own apprehension, yet avoiding our test of it by claiming it was impossible to describe. No ? to tell of God is not possible (phrasai men adynaton), so my argument runs, but to know him is even less possible (no?sai de adynat?teron). For language may show the known (to men gar no?then tacha an logos d?l?seien) if not adequately, at least faintly, to a person not totally deaf and dull of mind. But mentally to grasp so great a matter (to de tosouton pragma t? dianoia perilabein) is utterly beyond real possibility (pant?s adynaton kai am?chanon) even so far as the very elevated and devout are concerned, never mind slack and sinking souls-Whether higher, incorporeal natures can grasp it, I do not know (ouk oida de, ei m? kai tais an?ter? kai noeraisphysesin). (Norris 1991:226)</page><page sequence="24">24 D. . Giulea / Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 Gregory therefore re-articulates his apophatic position through Greek philosophical terminology. It is not only impossible to express God, as Plato affirmed in Timaeus 28c, but also to apprehend or "to know him is even less possible," because it is beyond the real possibility of mortals to "grasp so great a matter."43 In regard to the epistemic capacities of the natures more spiritual than human, most likely the angels, Gregory proclaims his ignorance. Conclusion From a socio-cultural perspective, my paper evinces the process of Hel lenization of the conception of divine inaccessibility. Theologically, my investigation points out the existence of two languages able to express this conception, namely biblical imagery and the Greek philosophical idiom. While Philo, Irenaeus, the Valentinians, Clement and Origen start and develop the "translation" from one idiom into the other, Greg ory equates their focal points, namely the inaccessible kabod with the divine essence. Most likely, philosophical apophatic discourse emerges within the hermeneutical context of interpreting the theophanies of the Old Testament and in connection with the tradition of the forbidden element of mystical experiences. Conceptual apophatic language ? a new garment for the ancient idea of divine inaccessibility ? becomes 43) I am much indebted to one of the anonymous reviewers for two reasons. First, he alerted me to Oration 30,17, where Gregory re-affirms his thesis about the impossibil ity of the human mind to apprehend God's nature and that of human language to express it: "Our starting-point must be the fact that God cannot be named {to theion akatonomaston)_no mind has yet contained or language embraced God's essence in its fullness (oute ousian theou pantel?s, e nous kech?reken, e f?ne perielaben)" (Norris 1991:273-274). Second, he suggested that Gregory, in his poetry written later in his life, tends to use more symbolic rather than philosophical language. Symbolic lan guage is therefore potentialized again in poetry. Undoubtedly, symbolic language was employed in the centuries that followed Gregory in liturgical and mystical poetry from Romanos the Melodist and Symeon the New Theologian to John of the Cross, Ange lus Silesius and many other inspired authors, and it is still highly appreciated nowadays. Consequently, the two languages ? the symbolic and the philoso phical ? represent two modalities in which the human mind has been expressing, since the end of Antiquity, both its glimpses of the divine and the impossibility to comprehend it.</page><page sequence="25">D. A. Giulea/Numen 57 (2010) 1-29 25 an important tool for the articulation of the ontology of the divine substance. Consequently, apophatic discourse in general represents an immemorial theological feature which clothed both symbolic and con ceptual garments. Another feature intimately connected with apophatic discourse is the dichotomy hidden-manifest, which in its turn clothed both sym bolic and conceptual garments. While biblical theophanic accounts expressed this dichotomy particularly through various symbols and images, Hellenistic theologians re-expressed it through a discourse about the inaccessible divine nature and its accessible ek-stasis, the divine hyparxis, dynamis, dilectio, erga, operationes or energeiai.
