ANTHROPOMORPHISM, TELEOLOGY, ANIMISM, AND PERSONIFICATION ' FROM beings time have .immemorial, been attributing human beings have been attributing human emotions, human charac- teristics, and even human vices to animals. The classic example of anthropomorphism was Benjamin Franklin's satirical statement oppos- ing the adoption of the bald eagle as our national symbol: "He is a bird of bad moral character; he does not get his living honestly; you may have seen him perched on some dead tree, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the labor of the fishing-hawk, and when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish and is bearing it to his nest for the sup- port of his mate and young ones, the bald eagle pursues him and takes it away from him." Today, few educated people would fail to see the humor of Ben Franklin's remarks - but there still is real danger that to characterize an animal as lazy, dishonest, or bad- tempered may lead some people to back up their moral judgments with guns. Gorillas, which, to naive Euro- peans, looked like stern and per- petually frowning men, acquired an undeserved reputation for ferocity and were needlessly persecuted. Some recent writers, decrying this history, have been at pains to assert that gorillas are "shy and retiring" or even "gentle." Neither of these characterizations is correct. Goril- las know man as a dangerous enemy and do not deliberately pick fights with him. But if provoked or cor- nered, a 300- to 400-pound adult male gorilla can be a formidable adversary. Thus anthropomorphism can be deceiving and even dangerous. True, scientists recognize that it is often convenient in informal discus- sions to call an animal "shy" simply to indicate that it is likely to retire if we approach it too closely, or to call another ferocious or bad- tempered to warn that its behavior is unpredictable and that it may attack suddenly. But they are quick to in- sist that there is no substitute for an adequate description of an animal's behavior patterns in explicit, non- human terms. Indeed, an anthro- pomorphic characterization is never needed for a complete understand- ing of the behavior of a nonhuman | species. Not that zoologists want to take the fun out of our viewing and react- ing to animals in our peculiarly g human and subjective ways. There ' is nothing wrong with the average zoo visitor's describing an animal as cute, endearing, or ugly - these are merely personal impressions. The problem may be that overemphasiz- | ing the appealing or unappealing aspects of animals may detract from our appreciating serious study and description. We may call a mata- Ä¼ mata turtle grotesque and forget to inquire about its bizarre appear- ance - its unusually long neck and the fleshy protuberances that cover it. We may forget, too, that all ani- | ' mais are worthy of our attention and | ' respect, not only those that appeal to us personally. It would be tragic if we allowed some species to be- g come extinct simply because we sub- I g jectively find them undistinguished or ungainly. Some conservationists have un- -WHY THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED 1 10 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page><page sequence="2">intentionally increased this danger by centering attention on the more popular or glamorous endangered species. When do we hear about a Save-the-Hawaiian-Crow or Save- the - Asiatic - Wild-Ass campaign? And what about the lowliest crea- tures in the food-chain - among them the minute crustaceans and aquatic larvae that feed some of the great wading birds in Florida's Ever- glades? If man robs the glades of too much water, not only the small creatures would die. With them would go the wood stork, the white ibis, the roseate spoonbill, and many others. The literal application of anthro- pomorphic attitudes would be active attempts to exterminate certain spe- cies whose appearance is unappeal- ing to humans. This has happened in the past and continues to happen, although such animals usually also have a mistaken reputation as pests. The groundless fear many people have of all snakes, lizards, or bats illustrates such irrational and dan- gerous emotions: However, our aesthetic responses are perfectly natural, and scientists share them. Indeed, many have been drawn to study nature through their appreciation of natural beauty. But they have learned to appreciate the beauty of its system and of its laws. From that point of view, even gro- tesque and commonplace animals are beautiful. Teleology The question of whether or not we are justified in attributing a purpose to an animal's actions is one that is still being debated by biologists, psychologists, and philosophers of science. The consensus seems to be that it is better to speak of the function of a bit of animal behavior rather than its purpose. We say that when a chimpanzee strips a twig and inserts it into a termite hole, this behavior has the function of obtain- ing termite grubs. Thus we avoid attributing a conscious intention or purpose to the animal. There are cases - in higher mammals, for in- stance - where it does seem that there is behavior closely analogous to what we would call conscious, purposive action in ourselves. Yet, when we say that an animal has a certain intention or purpose in per- forming a certain action, we are attributing to it a mental state that, at present at least, we have no way of judging whether or not it really has. Other problematic statements in- volving the attribution of purpose go beyond " anthropomorphizing other animals to in effect anthropomor- phizing all of nature. Along these lines teachers sometimes make care- less statements such as, "A hum- mingbird has a long bill so that it can reach into flowers and suck out nec- tar." What is wrong is the implica- tion that the hummingbird has a long bill for a purpose. Essentially, such a statement embodies an incor- rect interpretation of the nature of adaptation. When human beings first began to notice the marvels of adaptation, they still often tended to personify nature or natural forces. Wasn't it thoughtful of nature, some of them in effect said, to have provided hum- mingbirds with just the sort of bills they need to get their food! Later people began to wonder how adap- tation had actually come about. Charles Darwin attempted to answer this question with his theory of evo- lution by natural selection. He ex- plained how adaptations come to be without postulating any solicitude on the part of a personalized nature. It should be noted, by the way, that just because we call the theory of evolution by natural selection a "theory," we do not necessarily mean to say that it is not "fact." Theory and fact are not mutually exclusive terms, nor are all theories merely conjectures. Some theories, like Newton's theory of universal gravitation, are undoubtedly true. To call any body of statements a theory is to refer to its structure, to the fact that it is an organized sys- tem of statements designed to ac- count for and predict observable facts. Though the truth or falsity of those theoretical statements is not itself directly observable by means of our senses, the statements are grounded in observable phenomena and predict the way observable phenomena will take place. If ex- periment and observation show, as they unquestionably have for the theory of evolution by natural selec- tion, that the theory's predictions are correct, the theory itself is no less factual than what we actually see and measure. Briefly, the theory of natural selection takes its start from the fact of variation. Just as no two human beings are alike, no two animals of any species are alike. Somewhere in the ancestry of hummingbirds, those birds that had longer bills were bet- ter able to feed on nectar than those with shorter bills. Thus, in areas where nectar was abundant, the longer-billed birds tended to survive better and thus produce more off- spring. Their offspring too would have long bills; and over many gen- erations, the population in those areas would come to include a greater and greater percentage of long-billed birds. Thus, it is best for teachers to use such formulations as, "The hum- mingbird uses its long bill to reach into flowers to feed on nectar." This statement simply presents the fact of the adaptation. If the student wants an explanation, as hopefully he will, he will eventually be led to ask the same question as Darwin asked and can learn what Darwin concluded. It will be noticed that this formu- lation replaces talk about the pur- pose of the bill with talk about its function or use. Here again func- tion proves itself a useful concept in biology. Just as we talk about the way the heart functions, we can talk of the function of other bodily struc- tures or of special types of behavior. For talking about functions is only meaningful if we are talking about some sort of system, and biol- ogy is a science of systems - from cell to organism to habitat and pop- ulation to the ecological system of the planet itself.
