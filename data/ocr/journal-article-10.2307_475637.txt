(University of Toronto Romance Series, No. 1.) ARTICLES April-June 1949 Auerbach, Erich, "Saul's Pride (Purg., xII, 40-42)." MLN, LXIV, 267-269. Contends that Saul's superbia resides in his disobedience to God-an explanation with which Gregory the Great, the Pseudo-Eucherius, Wala- frid Strabo and Rupert of Deutz all agree. Prof. Auerbach further ad- vances the hypothesis that Saul appears here also as a figura Christi- to uphold which theory he quotes the Pseudo-Eucherius. Bowen, W. H. "Further Note on the Thirty Points of Woman's Beauty." MLN, LXIV, 272. Demonstrates that Jacques Gohory's Chanson de la Beautd (in Amadis de Gaule, bk XIII) is a close imitation of Nevizzano's poem on feminine beauty in Sylva Nuptialis and suggests further study of the sources of Ariosto's description of Alcina and a comparison of Nevizzano's poem with the enumerative poems of classical antiquity. Cantarella, Michele. "Guida bibliografica degli scrittori italiani in esilio (1925-1945)." Belfagor, Iv, 338-350. This is the third edition of such a bibliography, revised and brought up to 1945 with the addition of some 80 new titles. The first edition, also by Cantarella, appeared in Books Abroad, xII (1938); and the second, by Frances Keene, in Neither Liberty nor Bread (New York-London, Harper and Bros., 1940). Capitini, Aldo.

Occidental, I, 4 (April 1949), 1-3. Analyzes II Cielo e rosso, its plot and its style, in relation to contemporary Italian realism. Prof. De Simone contends that the first part of the novel, in which individual tragedies are absorbed and sublimated by the mass tragedy, has a tragic, choral sweep which makes it decidedly superior to the rest of the novel where Berto, as he proceeds to resolve the dilemma of his charac- ters, lapses into a romanticism and sentimentality that leave the reader with an unwholesome sense of utter despair and futility. Fergusson, Frank, "The Theatricality of Shaw and Pirandello." Partisan Review, xvI, 589-603. Contains a lengthy analysis of Six Characters in Search of an Author, which is made in part the basis of a comparison between Pirandello and Shaw. Pirandello is said to present Shaw's "unresolved paradoxes," his "farce-of-rationalizing," with finality and in an integral theatrical form, and he is credited with "inverting" the scene of modern realism, thereby vastly increasing the suggestiveness and the possible scope of the stage itself. Frangon, Marcel. "Les Itin6raires d'Italie et Gargantua." Italica, xxvI, 141- 145. Frezza, Mario. "Introduzione al Pomponazzi: Galeotto Marzio da Narni." Italica, xxvI, 136-140. Fucilla, Joseph G. "Recent Literature of the Renaissance: Italian." SP, XLVI, 315-337. Giusso, Lorenzo. "II Cahier de Philosophie di V. Gioberti: Rinascita." Italica, xxvI, 151-160. Golino, Carlo L. "An Unusual Italian Dictionary." Modern Language Forum, xxxIv, 1-2 (March-June 1949), 31-37. A study of Panzini's Dizionario Moderno, which discusses its evolution, its preparation, its contents and manner of presentation and its personal qualities. Grace, William J. "Orthodoxy and Aesthetic Method in Paradise Lost and the Divine Comedy." Comparative Literature, I, 173-187. Contends that, although Milton more closely abides by orthodox tradition in Paradise Lost than in any other work, he unfortunately tends therein toward anthropomorphism, rationalism, and a certain disrespect for mystery, whereas Dante's allegorical method allows that truth which is veiled in mystery to be indicated without exposition and presumption and is hence "best adapted to a penetration of the inclusive truth of religion." Grimm, Harold J. "Lorenzo Valla's Christianity." Church History, xvIII, 75-88. Favors Walser's thesis-viz., that Italian humanists generally accepted Christianity along with classical antiquity as their rightful heritage-and applies it to Valla. The latter's major works are examined and the conclusion is reached that, although Valla raised important philo- logical and historical questions and attacked the errors of medieval theo- logians, he never questioned the fundamental dogmas of the Church. Handy, Robert T. "The Influence of Mazzini on the American Social Gospel." Journal of Religion, xxix, 114-123. Maintains that the American social gospel, despite its own distinctive environment and historical condition- ing, was nevertheless related to, and influenced by, the socio-religious ideas of Europeans like Mazzini, who was greatly admired by such social gospel leaders as Rainsford, Commons, Lloyd, Gates, Herron, and Rauschenbusch. The ideas of these men are found to be similar to such Mazzinian concepts as "God and the People," duties before rights, association instead of competition, etc. Hatzfeld, Helmut. "A Clarification of the Baroque Problem in the Romance</page><page sequence="3">226 ITALICA Literatures." Comparative Literature, i, 113-139. Insists that there is a Baroque literary style, which must not be confused with such manneristic exaggerations as marinismo, conceptismo, priciosit6, etc. The charac- teristics of this Baroque style are: 1) a new formal humanism, based upon Aristotle's Poetics linked to the Counter Reformation; 2) catharsis (construed as a liberation from the passions and a spur to virtue) and decency, biensgance or scruple; 3) fusion of elements into a unity: fusion of descriptive elements into vague evocations, of visual elements into a dim chiaroscuro and of musical elements into vague, far-reaching echoes; 4) the paradox or fusion of the rational and the irrational; 5) majesty and magnificence; 6) individual dignity in the struggle between virtue and passion or the insistence upon the sense of duty, honor, and sacrifice, self- respect, etc. Countless examples are quoted from Tasso, Cervantes and Racine, to illustrate the author's conception of Baroque style. Huebener, Theodore. "I1 maestro d'italiano di Goethe." Italica, xxvI, 148- 150. Lipari, Angelo. "I1 gabbo semiserio del Poeta." Italica, xxvi, 121-130. Malkiel, Marfa Rosa Lida de. "Saber 'soler' en las lenguas romances y sus antecedentes grecolatinos." Romance Philology, II, 269-283. Lists also a few examples of sapere used with the meaning of solere. Malkiel, Yakov. "Studies in the Hispanic Infix -eg-." Language, xxv, 139- 181. Devotes a section (pp. 165-175) to discussing Span., OPtg. bernegal (vernegal), OItal. vernicale, Ven. vernical, vernegal, OTusc. vernicato, OGen. vernigdu, etc.; insists that the group is neither of Arabic ancestry nor from veronix ("varnish"), but believes instead that it is explained by apheresis of *hibernicdle and *hibernicdtum. Ital. vernaccia is also inci- dentally considered. Malkiel, Yakov. "Italian ciarlatano and its Romance Offshoots." Romance Philology, II, 317-326. Discusses various proposed etymologies of cer- retano and ciarlatano, their connection with Cerreto and ciarlare respec- tively, and Menges' new etymon, the Turkish diarla-t-an, without reaching any definite conclusions except to state that, although Fr. charlatan, Sp. charlatdn, Ptg. charlatdo are undoubtedly Italianisms, it is likely that Sp. charlatdn intervened later in the standardization of It. ciarlatano at the expense of cerretano and ciaratano. Marraro, Howard R. "Mazzini on American Intervention in European Af- fairs." Journal of Modern History, xxi, 109-114. Publishes for the first time the original text of a letter written by Mazzini on October 30, 1865 to the clergyman M. D. Conway. Merrill, Robert Valentine. "The Pl6iade and the Androgyne." Comparative Literature, I, 97-112. Also notes various Italian influences: e.g., that of Ficino's Convito upon H6roit and Muret and that of Bembo's Asolani and Stanze recitate per giuoco upon Marguerite de Navarre and BaIf. Pasinetti, P. M. "Giacomo Leopardi." Sewanee Review, LVII, 251-260. A sympathetic treatment of Leopardi, which stresses his literary isolation, his mental discipline of hopelessness, his sense of form, his total lack of affectation, his opposition to Romanticism, his variety of interests. The author insists that Leopardi is no enfant du sibcle, no sorrowful hero of the self-pitying variety, and he makes an earnest plea for further study of the poet outside of Italy. Poggioli, Renato. "A Tentative Literary Historiography Based on Pareto's Sociology." Symposium, III, 1-28. Outlines Pareto's sociological ideas with emphasis upon the concepts of residue (sentiment, complex, instinct,</page><page sequence="4">BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ITALIAN STUDIES IN AMERICA 227 etc.) and of derivation (the rationalization of a residue), then studies the passages in which literature is analyzed by Pareto, and finally derives therefrom the following hypotheses: 1) literature is a manifestation of derivations and residues: the residues being the substratum of creative literature, of poetry; the derivations, of the literature of ideas, of culture; 2) a literary history would study and point out the succession and alter- nation of periods in which literature is at times an expression of residues (e.g., Greece, Romanticism) and at times an expression of derivations (e.g., the French 18th Century). Ribner, Irving. "The Significance of Gentillet's Contre-Machiavel." MLQ, x, 153-157. Maintains that the recent investigations of N. Orsini and Har- din Craig prove the exaggeration of Meyer's thesis that the "Machiavel" of Elizabethan drama developed as a result of the false impressions cre- ated by Gentillet; and contends instead that the stage "Machiavel" grew out of three elements: 1) the Elizabethan inability to understand Machiavelli's method; 2) the Senecan "villain-hero"; 3) the devil-incar- nate tradition of the native English drama. Rossi, A. Olga. "Questione del Cavalca-More Findings." Italica, xxvi, 117- 120. Sarton, George. "Second Preface to Volume 40: In Defense of Petrarca's Book on the Remedies for Good and Evil Fortune." Isis, XL, 95-99. Deprecates Lynn Thorndike's strictures upon the De remediis utriusque fortunae, analyzes and praises its style and its traditional wisdom, and justifies its immense success. Schoder, Raymond V., S.J. "Vergil in the Divine Comedy." Classical Journal, XLIv, 413-422. A vindication of Dante's treatment of Vergil, written in refutation to Anna P. MacVay's "Dante's Strange Treatment of Vergil" (Classical Journal, XLIII). The author contends that Dante does not accept but opposes the medieval tradition of Vergil's necromancy, that he did not invent the tale of Erechtho to degrade Vergil but to make the poetic supposition plausible, that his tributes to Vergil are not mere lip- service but truly sincere, and that his excluding the Latin poet from Paradise is not only justifiable but indeed an inescapable consequence of Vergil's allegorical role in the poem as the symbol of natural reason. Semper, I. J. "Dante's Creed of Spiritual Love." Catholic World, CLXIX, 27- 33. Analyzes the Vita Nuova as the concrete expression of St. Thomas' description of the supernaturalized love of friendship. St. Thomas' argument that the image of God is found in man threefold-i.e., by creation, by re-creation, and by likeness of glory-comes to life in Dante's work 1) when he associates Beatrice with the mystic number nine, 2) when he subtly links her name and salutation with Christ, and 3) when he deals with her death and its aftermath. Slaughter, Eugene E. "Chaucer's Pandarus: Virtuous Uncle and Friend." JEGP, XLVIII, 186-195. Analyzes the Pandaro of the Filostrato and the Pandarus of Troilus and Criseyde with the purpose of showing that Chaucer modifies Boccaccio's character to make him conform to the classical ideal of friendship found in the Roman de la Rose. Stewart, H. L. "Dante and the Schoolmen." Journal of the History of Ideas, x, 357-373. Contends that, although on such great topics of Scholastic doc- trine as the problem of free will and knowledge and the scheme of vir- tues, the Divine Comedy accepts and even enforces the position of Aquinas, still Dante is aware of certain dogmatic difficulties in the latter's doctrine-difficulties which Dante presents with merciless clarity and</page><page sequence="5">228 ITALICA cogency but which he makes no attempt to systematize. The author touches upon some of these doubts and outlines the argument in the De Monarchia, which he is sure Aquinas would never have approved. Wilkins, Ernest H. "Berni's Bellezze." Italica, xxvI, 146-147. Wilkins, Ernest H. "The Chronology of the Canzoniere of Petrarch." RR, XL, 114-121. Reassembles the data presented in "A Chronological Con- spectus of the Writings of Petrarch" (RR, xxxIx) and in "The Evo- lution of the Canzoniere of Petrarch" (PMLA, LXIII) and restates them with a view to throwing light on the degree of chronological control exer- cized by Petrarch in the arrangement of the poems in the various forms of the Canzoniere. Prof. Wilkins also includes two comprehensive tables: one on the chronology of the Pre-Chigi form and the other on the chronology of the additions to the Pre-Chigi form. REVIEWS Altrocchi, Rudolph.

Antioch Review, viii, 3 (Fall 1948), 321-330. Admits that Machiavelli has numerous en- lightened and progressive ideas, but insists that he cannot be regarded as a genuine liberal because of his contempt for human nature, his pessimistic conception of government and history, his glorification of war, and his justification of ruthlessness for reasons of state. Friederich, W. P. "Dante Through the Centuries." Comparative Literature, I, 1 (Winter 1949), 44-54. A succinct survey of Dante's fortuna which stresses: 1) the influence of the Commedia upon the great allegorical poems of the 14th and 15th Centuries; 2) the decline of Dante's fame (except for the vogue of the De Monarchia in Protestant lands) from 1500 to the advent of Romanticism; 3) the great popularity of the Corn- media (esp. the Inferno) from the end of the 18th Century to the present day; 4) the countless works of literature and art inspired by Dante's characters; 5) the role played by Italians abroad in enhancing Dante's fame. The author observes that of foreign literatures English affords the best evidence of a continuous knowledge and appreciation of Dante. Toffanin, Giuseppe. "Omero e il Rinascimento italiano." Comparative Litera- ture, I, 1 (Winter 1949), 55-62. Maintains that from Petrarch to the mid-Cinquecento the humanists regarded Homer with a religious rever- ence second only to that inspired in them by Plato. This humanistic regard, anticipated by Dante and culminating in Poliziano, in P. P. Decembrio's Vita Homeri, and later in Vico's Scienza Nuova, is generally frowned upon by the rationalistic 17th and 18th Centuries. The Kenyon Review, xI, 251-268, contains a translation by Elaine Fritzel of "Geltrude," a short story in diary form by Michele Spina.</page></plain_text>
