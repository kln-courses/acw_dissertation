<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetic License in the Qur'an: Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaffs Ihk?m al-r?y fl ahk?m al-?y Devin J. Stewart Emory University Scholarship on the Qur'an in the modern Western tradition has often failed to recognise and build on the relevant work of medieval Muslim authors. In part, the problem is one of limited exposure: many relevant discussions of the Qur'anic text do not occur in the most obvious places, the famous exegeses of al-Tabar? (d. 310/923), al-Zamakhshar? (d. 538/1144), al-Bayd?w? (d. 685/1286) and others, but in works on rhetoric, law, theology and other topics. In addition, many important works, such as the exegesis of al-Tabar? or al-Burh?nfi cul?m al-Qur??n by Badr al-D?n al-Zarkash? (d. 794/1392), were not available to scholars of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the seminal Western studies of the Qur'an were completed. In part, though, neglect is the result of a prejudiced assumption that medieval Muslim scholars were unwilling or unable to treat certain issues in a critical manner. This assumption has been quite evident in the response to Cristoph Luxenberg's recent book on the Syriac influence on the Qur'an, in which he proposed many emendations to the text.1 Reactions of scholars in Islamic studies consistently failed to address the fact that traditional Islamic scholarship on the Qur'an included sustained discussions of textual variants and emendations, even though works in which such scholarship is evident, such as al-Suy?tfs (d. 911/1505) al-Itq?nfi cul?m al-Qur??n, were published over a century ago.2 Many recent studies on the Qur'an have ignored or made limited use of traditional Islamic scholarship, while also ignoring earlier Western scholarship on the Qur'an, particularly in German; the recent publication of the Encyclopaedia of the Qur??n should help to remedy this situation by making the contents of many medieval Arabic works and many German studies on the text of the Qur'an over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries readily accessible in English. Regarding questions of rhyme, the gap between Orientalist and traditional Islamic scholarship in Qur'anic studies has been particularly glaring. Over 85% of the ayas of the Qur'an exhibit end-rhyme, and rhyme is such a crucial feature of the text that it provides a guide to the interpretation and structural analysis of many ayas and entire passages. In addition, many passages in the Qur'an show a marked affinity with oracular genres associated with the speech of pre-Islamic soothsayers, and there is abundant evidence to suggest that a great deal of the Qur'an is couched in, or at least is formally quite similar to, sajc, usually termed 'rhymed prose' or 'rhymed and</page><page sequence="2">2 Journal of Qur'anic Studies rhythmical prose'. In view of such facts, the attention devoted to rhyme and rhythm in Western scholarship on the Qur'an to date, though significant, is still quite limited, as is that literature's use of the relevant medieval sources. As in many other cases, Theodor N?ldeke's 1860 work Geschichte des Qorans long remained one of the most insightful studies that touched on rhyme in the Qur'an and made the best use of medieval Arabic sources on the topic.3 While N?ldeke paid a great deal of attention to the works of medieval Islamic authors that were available to him, many subsequent authors have not done so to nearly the same degree, and it appears that this is due at least in part to the idea that medieval Muslim commentators were shackled by theological doctrine in their investigations of the Qur'an. Western scholars including Blach?re, Bell, Watt and others recognised the important role played by sajc or rhymed prose in the Qur'an but drew only limited material from the fairly extensive critical discussions devoted to the topic by medieval Muslim authors, whether in works on cul?m al-Qur3?n such as al-Suy?t?'s al-Itq?n fi cul?m al-Qur??n, or in works on Arabic rhetoric. In a 1979 assessment of the state of the art in Qur'anic studies, Alford Welch calls attention neither to rhyme nor to rythmn as a major category of investigation to date or as an avenue of research to be pursued in the future.4 In contrast, Angelika Neuwirth emphasises rhyme as a crucial, desired focus of investigation in a similar assessment presented in 1980 as part of a larger plea for the application of literary critical techniques, including form criticism, to the Qur'an.5 Her Studien zur Komposition der mekkanischen Suren, which treats rhyme in the Qur'an in great detail, was published the next year. She approaches the topic primarily through an independent examination, after providing a short overview of Western scholarship on rhyme in the Qur'an in which she remarks that little new has been done in this area since the efforts of N?ldeke in 1860, N?ldeke and Schwally in 1909, and Bell in 1953. Neuwirth's analysis draws significantly on one medieval discussion of rhyme and rhythm in the Qur'an, that found in Icj?z al-Qur??n, by al-B?qill?n? (d. 403/1013). She also makes a plea for studies of the technique of both pre-Islamic and Qur'anic sajc as necessary steps before attempting to define the relationship between the two.6 Advances have been made in the analysis of Qur'anic sajc, but a detailed description of the workings of pre-Islamic sajc has not yet been undertaken, to the best of my knowledge.7 There are certainly reasons for thinking that medieval Muslim authors might have avoided discussions of rhyme in the Qur'an. The Qur'an denies quite emphatically that the divine messages the Prophet conveys are the speech of a poet (Q. 21:5; Q. 37:36; Q. 52:30; Q. 69:41) or a soothsayer (Q. 52:29; Q. 69:42).8 To suggest that the Qur'an exhibits rhyme and rhythm, the main features of poetry or the rhymed prose of pre-Islamic oracular traditions, therefore approaches blasphemy. By the fourth/tenth century, the doctrine of the inimitability of the Qur'an (icj?z al-Qur??n) had become firmly established; to compare the Qur'anic text with mundane genres</page><page sequence="3">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-rayfl ahkam al-ay 3 was to risk questioning its miraculous nature and, since the Qur'an is held to be the central miracle of the Prophet's mission, the validity of his message and of Islam itself.9 Presumably, at least in part because of such theological implications, medieval commentators paid relatively little attention to rhyme and rhythm, in comparison with other features of the text such as syntax, lexicon and figures of speech. Both traditional Islamic scholarship and modern textual studies of the Qur'an often overlook the importance of rhyme in the text and consequently make serious errors in its interpretation. Traditional analyses of a number of passages where the structure of an aya has clearly deviated from ordinary usage for the sake of end-rhyme often ignore rhyme altogether and therefore offer contrived grammatical explanations for the irregularities noticed. One example is the aya iyy?ka nacbudu wa-iyy?ka nastac?n, literally You we worship, and You we seek out for help (Q. 1:5) in S?rat al-F?tiha. Many explications of this aya suggest that the extraordinary word order, with the direct objects placed before the verbs, serves as a type of grammatical emphasis, or 'specification' {ikhtis?s), without pointing out that the ordinary word order, which would be nacbuduka wa-nastac?nukaf would ruin the required end-rhyme -?n/-?n}? Similarly, difficult grammatical explications have been provided for the word order in the aya wa-lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad (Q. 112:4), which may be rendered over literally as and there was not to Him equal anyone. The required rhyme in this context is -ad, since the rhyme-words of the three preceding ayas are ahad[un], s-samad[u] and y?lad. The contrived grammatical explanations should probably be rejected; the aya is equivalent in meaning to the ordinary wa-lam yakun ahad kufuwan lahu ('and no one is equal to Him'), and the change in word order is due mainly to the exigencies of the end-rhyme.11 The perfect tense is required by parallelism with the preceding verbs lam yalid {He did not bear) and lam y?lad {he was not born). Another example of the neglect of rhyme, this time in modern Western scholarship, is provided by Bellamy's study on the muqattac?t, the 'mysterious letters' that occur at the beginnings of 29 out of the 114 suras of the Qur'an. Bellamy proposes a complex collection of emendations to explain that these combinations of letters - fourteen distinct combinations in all, ranging from a single letter to a series of five - are actually all corruptions of the basmalah, the phrase bi'smi'll?hi'l-rahm?ni'l-rahlm {In the name of God, the Merciful and the Beneficent), that is prefaced to 113 of the 114 suras of the Qur'an (the exception being the ninth sura, S?rat al-Tawba or S?rat al-Bar??a)}2 Bellamy's suggested emendations are unlikely in this case not only because they would require the 29 suras to have had two basmalahs, in effect, but also because they would require a large number of quite different corruptions to have occurred to prominent, identical phrases in the text. Yet the crucial point for this discussion is that Bellamy does not assign weight to the fact that most of these combinations of letters rhyme with the ensuing ayas. Regular rhyme suggests they are integral parts of the text of the suras, and not later additions, as the basmalah in all</page><page sequence="4">4 Journal of Qur'anic Studies probability was, and are therefore unlikely to have resulted from corruptions of the basmalah. A clear counter-example to Bellamy's theory is Sur at T?-h? (Q. 20), which begins with the two letters t?-h? and continues to rhyme in -? for most of its 135 ayas. The emendation o? t?-h? to hi ' smill?hVl-rahm?nVl-rahlm would ruin a rhyme that was presumably intended in the text.13 Many further examples could be adduced to show that considerations of rhyme and rhythm have often been neglected in the analysis of the text of the Qur'an. The effect of end-rhyme on Qur'anic ayas has not been completely ignored in Western Qur'anic studies. Friedrun R. Miiller's 1969 study Untersuchungen zur Reimprosa im Koran, while not a comprehensive treatment of sajc or rhymed prose in the Qur'an, treats one important issue within that larger subject, what may be termed 'poetic license': the effect of rhyme on the final words and structure of ayas, or, in other words, the departures from ordinary usage which serve to facilitate end-rhyme. M?ller offers numerous examples to show that word order is altered and that other syntactic changes occur for the sake of rhyme. Forms of words are also modified in order to fit the pattern and rhyme letter of the final words of adjacent ayas. This study helps to clarify many puzzling passages in the Qur'an and indeed goes far beyond the handful of examples of these phenomena noted by N?ldeke and other Western scholars. The main weakness of Miiller's work is its lack of awareness of medieval Islamic scholarship on the question of 'poetic license', when a number of accomplished critics devoted substantial discussions to it. Of the many exegetical works that pay close attention to language - the exegeses of al-Tabari, al-Zamakhshari, and al-Bayd?w?, al-Kis?Ts (d. 189/805) Kit?b al-mutash?bih fi'l-Qur'?n, al-Farr?3's (d. 207/822) Kit?b mac?nl al-Qur??n, and Ibn Qutayba's (d. 276/889) Tafs?r ghar?b al-Qur??n and Ta?w?l mushkil al-Qur3?n - M?ller makes the following statement:14 Although many valuable and ? propos observations have been recorded in them, it nevertheless becomes apparent that the belief of the Muslim in the Kal?m Allah ('the Speech of God') renders the approach to an explanation of linguistically difficult passages more difficult rather than easier. For him, the Word of God is not only unassailable but also the inimitable model of linguistic correctness. Trapped in this way, Muslims till today have not been able to see the Koran as a historically contingent linguistic artifact. It is certainly the case that rhyme was not granted sufficient attention in many medieval Islamic discussions of the Qur'an, but the claim that religious dogma categorically prevented Muslim scholars from performing serious linguistic or critical textual studies of the Qur'an is demonstrably false. Some medieval Muslim scholars dealt explicitly with the exact topic of M?ller's book and even stated directly that syntax and the forms of words had been altered on account of rhyme. Doctrinal</page><page sequence="5">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 5 considerations may have occasionally kept them from voicing such opinions about the text or expressing certain ideas in blunt terms, yet their works demonstrate a deep awareness of the Qur'an as a linguistic artifact. Despite doctrinal considerations, many Muslim scholars recognised the importance of rhyme and the use of rhymed prose in the Qur'anic text. The parameters and conventions of their discourse may have differed from those of Orientalists, but it cannot be denied that they engaged in sustained, critical investigations of the issue. Some critics even compared the Qur'anic text directly with poetry, particularly with regard to end-rhyme. Perhaps the most striking statement of this type is that of al-J?hiz (d. 255/868), who compares the two directly:15 God named His Book differently from the way the Arabs named their speech, as a whole and in its parts: He named the whole a Qur??n, just as they named it a dlw?n; one part of that whole a s?ra, like an ode in poetry (qas?da); and one part of that an ?ya, like the verse (bayt); and the end of that zf?sila, like a rhyme-word (q?fiya). While the emphasis here is on the difference in terminology, the direct comparison with poetry is nevertheless clear: Qur??n corresponds to dlw?n, s?ra to qas?da, ?ya to bayt, zndf?sila to q?fiya. Ab? cAl? al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Faris? (d. 377/987) reports that those authorities who read the terms al-zun?n? (Q. 33:10), al-ras?l? (Q. 33:66) and al-sabll? (Q. 33:67) with final long -? do this on the grounds of a direct comparison with poetry: 'hiya ru3?s al-?y tushabbahu bi'l-qaw?fi min haythu k?nat maq?tic kam? k?nat al-qaw?fi maq?ti0" ('verse-final words may be likened to rhyme words in that they provide terminal rhyming syllables, as do the rhyme-words in poetry').16 Al-Zamakhshari states 'juHlat faw?sil al-?y ka-qaw?fi al-shicr wa q?cidatuh? al-waqf wa'l-dal?la ?al? anna al-kal?m qad inqataca wa-anna m? bacdahu musta3naf ('The verse-final words are treated like the rhyme-words of poetry: they require a pause, and they indicate that the speech has come to a close and that it will resume afterwards').17 Similarly, Ab? Hayy?n al-Gharn?t? (d. 745/1344) compares the verse-final words of the Qur'an with rhyme-words in poetry: about the final -? in al-zun?n? (Q. 33:10) he writes, 'this agrees with a certain method of the Arabs, for they retain this long -? in the rhyme-words and hemistich-final words18 of their poems, for colon-final words in speech are like hemistich-final words in poetry (al-faw?sil fi'l-kal?m ka'l-mas?r?cy,19 Many similar comments can be found, scattered in medieval exegeses and works on Arabic rhetoric. Such remarks suggest that some medieval scholars of the Qur'an recognised an important connection between the Qur'an and poetry, despite the doctrine of inimitability. A few medieval literary critics and scholars of the Qur'an addressed the features of sajc in the Qur'an in detail, and the conclusions of their valuable studies on the prosody of sajc and related topics have yet to be evaluated and incorporated into modern</page><page sequence="6">6 Journal of Qur'anic Studies investigations of the Qur'anic text. Among the most important of these discussions is that found in al-Mathal al-s?3ir fi sin?cat al-k?tib wa'l-sh?cir by Diy?3 al-D?n ibn al-Ath?r (d. 637/1239). M?ller notes, quoting Goldziher, that he defended the use of sajc9 but she did not consult his work, even though it had been published in B?l?q already in 1865-6, and again in Egypt in the 1950's.20 Attention to sajc prosody was evident already in works from the fourth/tenth century, such as Ab? Hil?l al-cAskar?'s (d. after 395/1005) Kit?b al-sin?catayn, on whose discussion Ibn al-Ath?r drew. Ibn al-Ath?r recognised that a large part of the Qur'an is couched in sajc, and he described its prosody in some detail. In a 1990 article,21 I undertook an analysis of the formal features of Qur'anic sajc based primarily on Ibn al-Ath?r's work, supplemented by material from other authors in rhetoric and cul?m al-Qur??n as well as independent investigation of the text. I suggested that sajc may be defined as a type of accent poetry, where the short and long syllables of adjacent cola do not necessarily scan in a parallel manner, but the number of beats, provided by the word accents, generally do. Another early critic who treats sajc substantially is Ab?'l-Tayyib al-B?qill?ni (d. 403/ 1013), whose Icj?z al-Qur??n reveals a sophisticated understanding of sajc prosody despite the fact that he categorically denies its occurrence in the Qur'an.22 Though M?ller would have readers believe that this is impossible because of Muslims' theology, al-B?qill?ni is aware of the possibility, or at least the claim, that the structure of ayas in the Qur'an changes for the sake of rhyme. He himself admits that the strongest argument for those who claim that the Qur'an is sajc is the following. When Moses and Aaron are mentioned together in the Qur'an they usually appear in that order: M?s? wa-H?r?n (Q. 6:84; Q. 7:122; Q. 10:75; Q. 21:48; Q. 26:48; Q. 37:114, 120). This is logical because Moses is superior (afdal) or more important, and should therefore come first. However, when the two are mentioned in a passage with end rhyme in -?, the order is reversed and they appear as Aaron and Moses: fa-ulqiya'l saharatu sujjadan q?l? ?mann? bi-rabbi H?r?na wa-M?s? (So the magicians were thrown down, prostrate, declaring, 'We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses ', Q. 20:70), versus the expected order in, e.g., q?l? ?mann? bi-rabbVWalamina * rabbi M?s? wa-H?r?n (They declared, 'We believe in the Lord of the nations, * the Lord of Moses and Aaron, Q. 7:121-2). Al-B?qill?n?'s opponents would argue that the text of the Qur'an has been modified here in order to conform to the exigencies of sajc.23 Al-B?qill?ni disagrees, on grounds that are not entirely convincing in this case: that part of the Qur'an's rhetorical excellence involves repeating the same stories in many different forms, so that such discrepancies as this arise but belong to the artful variation found in the text. Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s Analysis of Poetic License in the Qur'an A number of medieval Muslim scholars wrote works devoted to what might be termed poetic license in the Qur'an, the deviations from ordinary Arabic lexicon,</page><page sequence="7">Ibn al-SaDigh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 1 grammar, morphology, syntax or style that occur in the Qur'anic text for the sake of end-rhyme, the focus of M?ller's study. Some of these are apparently lost, such as Bughyat al-w?sil il? macrifat al-faw?sil by Sulaym?n ibn cAbd al-Qaw? ai-Tufi (d. 716/1316).24 The most important medieval Islamic study devoted to this topic that has been identified to date is Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s (d. 776/1365) Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y. The work is not extant, but three extant texts are witnesses to its contents: Badr al-D?n al-Zarkash?'s (d. 794/1392) al-Burh?nfi cul?m al-Qur3?n, Jal?l al-D?n al-Suy?t?'s (d. 911/1505) al-Itq?n fi cul?m al-Qur??n, and Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ta?k?pr?z?de's (d. 960/1553) Mift?h al-sac?da.25 Al-Suy?ti provides an abridged version of the entire text, from which it is evident that Ihk?m al-r?y presented 40 categories of deviation from ordinary usage for the sake of rhyme. The section of al-Zarkash?'s Burh?n that treats the same topic evidently draws on Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-r?y a great deal, but does not acknowledge Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf? as a source and does not present an abridgement. He has rearranged the material into twelve categories and added material from other sources. Ta?k?pr?z?de provides an abridgement as well, but it is likely that he lifted the entire text from al-Suy?ti's Itq?n and had no independent access to the original Ihk?m al-r?y, for the text he presents is essentially identical to al-Suy?t?'s version. Ihk?m al-r?y may have been extant as late as the eleventh/seventeenth century, for H?jj? Khal?fa (d. 1067/ 1657) lists it in his bibliography Kashf al-zun?n.26 One may yet hope to discover an intact manuscript of the text, miscatalogued or overlooked in a collection of disparate treatises, in one of the libraries of Cairo, Damascus, Istanbul or elsewhere. Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?'s work has not been completely neglected in modern Qur'anic studies. N?ldeke, aware of it through al-Suy?t?'s Itq?n, made the following comment:27 For example, in 2:81 - fa-farlqan kadhdhabtum wa-far?qan taqtul?n [literally, One group you belied and one group you kill'] - the last word [taqtul?n 'you kill'] occurs in place of qataltum ['you killed'], which would be required by parallelism, on account of the rhyme. This influence was recognised by some Muslims as well, and Shams al-D?n ibn al-S?3igh furnished excellent observations on this topic in his book Ihk?m al-ra?y fi ahk?m al-?y, cited in al-Itq?n, p. 669 ff., in which he admittedly went much too far. In his 1906 study of Qur'anic language, V?llers presents this same example, of Q. 2:81, referring to the 'modest liberties' that occur on account of rhyme in the Qur'an.28 Schwally's revised and expanded version of N?ldeke's Geschichte des Qorans repeats this Statement, adding that Ily?sln (Q. 37:130) occurs for Ily ?s, S?n?n (Q. 95:2) for S?n?3 or Sayn?3, that two gardens with two springs and two types of fruit and yet again two gardens are included in a description of Paradise</page><page sequence="8">8 Journal of Qur'anic Studies (Q. 55:46, 50, 52, 62), that eight (tham?niy?) angels hold up God's Throne in Q. 69:17, and that a perfect verb is often rewritten as k?na with a participle or min with a following genitive, all on acount of the rhyme.29 The first three examples all occur in Ihk?m al-r?y as reported in al-Itq?n; the others are evidently the result of Schwally's independent observations. Bell and Watt's introduction to the Qur'an includes a nearly identical discussion.30 Despite N?ldeke's mention of Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?'s treatise, and despite the wide availability of al-Itq?n fi cul?m al-Qur??n, M?ller does not appear to have taken Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s material into account in her study. This is surprising, for it is devoted exclusively to the exact topic that M?ller undertakes to explain, with fewer examples but overall with a great deal of insight and sophistication. Many other modern studies have ignored the work.31 Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?'s work and the issue of 'poetic license' in the Qur'an have received more substantial attention in the Arab world. In his 1951 book Fann al-asj?c, still the best single treatment of saj0 to date, cAl? al-Gind? draws on Ihk?m al-r?y, citing the abridgement in Ta?k?pr?z?de's Mift?h al-sac?da, in his chapter on verse final words in the Qur'an. He lists ten of Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s types of deviation from ordinary usage in the Qur'an for the sake of rhyme, and comments briefly on the merits of his work.32 Muhammad al-Hasn?w? conducts an extensive analysis of Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s text in al-F?sila fi'l-QurJ?n, first published in 1977 and then again in 1986.33 Al-Hasn?w? provides a short summary of Ibn al-S?3igh's categories of deviation from ordinary usage in the Qur'an for the sake of end-rhyme, without the examples.34 He then compares Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s 40 categories with those of al-Zarkash?, who lists twelve categories of deviation from ordinary usage.35 He remarks that Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf? was not the first to address this issue but that his work represents the most comprehensive treatment. Overall, al-Hasn?w? considers Ibn al-Sa3igh's work to be a first-rate discussion of the 'scientific' aspect of the topic, by which he means the technical grammatical and syntactical features involved, but finds that he ignored its 'aesthetic' aspects, a major focus of al-Hasn?wf s own work.36 In his 1986 work, al-F?sila al-Qur0 ?niyya, cAbd al-Fatt?h L?sh?n discusses 'the deviation of the arrangement of the aya from customary usage on account of the verse final word' ('khur?j nazm al-?ya can al-ma^l?f bi-sabab al-f?sila'). He draws primarily on al-Zarkash?'s al-Burh?nfi cul?m al-Qur3?n, but consulted other works as well.37 He notes that al-Suy?t? presents a summary of Ibn al-S??igh's Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y, but appears not to have drawn on the work a great deal for his own discussion.38 In a study published in 1993, cAbd al-Jaw?d Muhammad Tabaq also treats the effects of end-rhyme on ayas in the Qur'an, drawing both on al-Zarkash?'s discussion in the Burhan and on Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s work as abridged in al-Suy?ti's Itq?n. He refers to deviations from ordinary usage for the sake of rhyme as instances of 'the boldness of the Arabic language' (shaj?cat al-cArabiyya). He</page><page sequence="9">Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 9 includes in his discussion nearly all of Ibn al-Sa?igh's examples, along with others, but in many cases does not cite Ibn al-S??igh explicitly.39 The Life and Works of Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanafi Shams al-D?n Muhammad ibn cAbd al-Rahman ibn cAl? ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf? al-Zumurrud? was born in Cairo in 707/1307-8 or, according to other accounts, in 704/1304-5. He excelled in the variant readings of the Qur'an (qir???f), Arabic grammar, the literary arts (adab\ law and jurisprudence or legal theory. His teachers were the most accomplished scholars of the time. He studied qir?3?t with a certain Muhammad al-Misr? (fl. early eighth/fourteenth century) and Taq? al-D?n Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn cAbd al-Kh?liq al-S??igh (d. 725/1325). He studied grammar with Ath?r al-D?n Ab? Hayy?n al-Gharn?t? (d. 745/1344) and rhetoric with cAl?D al-D?n al-Q?naw? (d. 729/1329) and al-Q?d? Jal?l al-D?n al-Qazw?n? (d. 739/1339), the famous author of the rhetorical manuals Talkh?s al-mift?h and al-Id?h. He travelled to Damascus in 728/1327-8, when al-Q?naw? was serving as chief judge there, and taught Arabic and Qur'anic variant readings in the Umayyad mosque. He soon returned to Cairo, where he taught the Qur'an, qir???t, law and Arabic grammar. He wrote fat?w? for many years and taught as a mudarris in several institutions, including the Mosque of Ibn T?l?n and the Ashrafiyya Madrasa. He was the first Hanaf? to be appointed as mufti at Dar al-cAdl, a strong testimony to his excellent training in law. He received an honourary inaugural robe for this position on 12 Rab?c II765/18 January 1364. In 769/1367-8, the famous Qur'anic expert al-Jazari (d. 832/1428-9) travelled to Cairo to study under his supervision. That year, al-Jazar? completed with him the entire Qur'an according to the seven readings, along with the major textbooks on the variant readings, al-Tayslrfiyl-qirdDat al-sabc by cUthman ibn Sac?d al-D?n?

In Rajab 773/January 1372, the post of Q?d? al-cAskar was added to Ibn al-S??igh's responsibilities.

An overview of Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s works shows that he wrote a number of treatises devoted to specific topics in Qur'anic studies. These include Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y and another treatise that may have addressed a similar topic, Mabda0 al-nih?y?t fi'l-kal?m cal?'l-?y?t, as well as al-Taqdima fi sirr al-alf?z al-mutaqaddima, Nashr al-cablrfi iq?mat al-z?hir maq?m al-dam?r, and al-Wadc al b?hirfi raf afal al-z?hir. He also wrote a commentary on al-Zamakhshar?'s famous exegesis, al-Kashsh?f and several larger works that devoted considerable attention to the Qur'an, including al-Manhaj al-qaw?m fi far?0id tatacallaqu bVl-Qur??n al-caz?m and the monumental anthology Majmac al-far??id wa-manbac al-faw??id, in seventeen (or nineteen) volumes, on Arabic and other topics. The evidence of Ihk?m al-r?y alone is sufficient as an indication of Ibn al-Sa?igh's valuable and perceptive analysis of the Qur'an. This assessment will likely be corroborated if additional works that he authored are discovered in the future. On Ihkam al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y As mentioned above, the witnesses to this work by Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf? are three texts, the most important of which is al-Suy?t?'s al-Itq?nfi cul?m al-Qur??n. As in a number of other cases, al-Suy?t? provides a summary or abridgment of the entire work in the Itq?n, in this case in the section devoted to verse-final words (faw?sil), chapter (nawc) 59 out of the 80 chapters in the work. It is not the only work of Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf? that al-Suy?t? used in the Itq?n. He cites three other treatises Ibn al-S??igh devoted to specific topics in the textual analysis of the Qur'an: Nashr al-cab?r fi iq?mat al-z?hir maq?m al-dam?r, al-Muqaddima f? sirr al-alf?z al-muqaddama, and Rawd al-afh?m fi aqs?m al-istifh?m, treating the use of an ordinary noun in place of a pronoun, hysteron proteron, and types of interrogatives, respectively. In all he refers to Ibn al-Sa?igh ten times by name in the text and according to one estimate quotes explicitly a total of 162 lines.42 The case of al-Zarkash?'s work al-Burh?n fi cul?m al-Qur??n is more complicated. Kenneth Nolin has shown that al-Suy?t?'s work depends heavily on that of</page><page sequence="12">12 Journal of Qur'anic Studies al-Zarkash?. As he puts it, at least 74 pages of the 380 page edition of the Itq?n follow the text of the Burh?n closely, considerably more than al-Suy?t? admits directly, or about 19.5% of the whole. In some cases he lifts entire sections from the Burh?n along with the sources cited and examples, while other passages follow al-Zarkash? in general but have been reworked. In yet other cases, the two writers may have been drawing on the same source in parallel.43 In this particular case, it is clear that al Zarkash? and al-Suy?t? were using Ibn al-Sa?igh's work independently. Al-Suy?t? could not have lifted his material regarding Ibn al-S?3igh's work directly from al-Burh?n, for al-Zarkash? does not mention the title Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y, in contrast to al-Suy?t?, and al-Zarkash? has rearranged the material from Ibn al-S??igh's work, while al-Suy?t?'s summary preserves the original structure of al-Ihk?m. Nevertheless, al-Zarkash? was certainly drawing on al-Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y. He was aware of Ibn al-S?3igh's works on the Qur'an, for he cites them explicitly, although not in this particular section. Al-Zarkash? and Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf? were contemporaries and had probably met. The section of al-Burh?n devoted to the topic of changes in normal usage that occur for the sake of end-rhyme cites many of the examples Ibn al-S?3igh presented, as is evident from comparison with al-Suy?t?'s summary, and for the most part explains them in similar fashion. Al-Hasn?w? concludes that al-Zarkash? used Ibn al-S?^gh's work but omitted to point this out, 'in contrast to his custom'.44 He provides a table showing the correspondences of Ibn al-Sa3igh's 40 categories of deviation to al-Zarkash?'s twelve categories, as follows:45 al-Zarkash? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Ibn al-SiVigh 8 6, 7 8, 30 3 21 24 22 12 18 10 26 39</page><page sequence="13">Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkarn al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 13 It is clear from this table that al-Zarkash? did not simply condense Ibn al Sa?igh's work to write this section of his work, but used the work extensively as a source for his own discussion, rearranging the material thoroughly. This is also suggested by his references to a number of other sources, particularly works of exegesis that are not cited in the summary given in al-Itq?n. The possibility remains that Ibn al-Sa3igh had in fact cited these additional sources in Ihk?m al-r?y, but that al-Suy?t? edited them out of his summary. However, if one looks at the example ayas that Ibn al-S?3igh used, one finds that a number of them are repeated in al-Zarkashfs section. A-Suy?t?'s summary of al-Ihk?m cites the following ayas as examples: Q. 1:1 (e.g.), 5; Q. 2:8, 87, 143 (e.g.), 177; Q. 7:170; Q. 12:4; Q. 13:9, 32; Q. 14:31, 52; Q. 17:13, 45, 69; Q. 18:10, 30, 49; Q. 19:61, 64; Q. 20:7, 33, 54 (e.g.), 67, 70, 73 (e.g.), 77, 117, 129, also as a whole sura; Q. 21:73; Q. 25:74; Q. 28:70; Q. 29:3; Q. 33:10, 67; Q. 36:40; Q. 38:5; Q. 53:22, 25 (also generally); Q. 54:16 (e.g.), 20, 41, 53, 54; Q. 55:46; Q. 69:7, 21, 28, 29; Q. 70:15; Q. 72:14; Q. 74:26; Q. 76:15-16; Q. 86:6; Q. 87:4-5, 6; Q. 89:4; Q. 91:12; Q. 92:5, 19; Q. 93:3; Q. 95:2; Q. 99:5; Q. 101:7, 9, 10; Q. 104:4; Q. 111:3; Q. 112:4. Al-Zarkash? cites the following ayas as examples: Q. 1:5; Q. 2:63, 65, 87; Q. 12:46; Q. 14:31; Q. 17:69; Q. 18:51; Q. 20:67, 117, 129; Q. 29:19; Q. 33:10, 26, 66, 67; Q. 36:40; Q. 54:41, 54; Q. 55:46; Q. 74:54; Q. 76:4, 15-16; Q. 87:1; Q. 89:4; Q. 91:2; Q. 93:1-2; Q. 95:2; Q. 96:1; Q. 101:10. The ayas that both cite as examples are the following: Q. 1:5; Q. 2:87; Q. 14:31; Q. 17:69; Q. 20:67, 117, 129; Q. 33:10, 67; Q. 36:40; Q. 54:54; Q. 55:46; Q. 76:15-16; Q. 95:2; Q. 101:10. Al-Suy?t?'s summary contains many more examples than al-Zaraksh?'s section, 71 as opposed to 30. While there is a significant overlap, of fifteen examples, al-Zarkash?'s discussion also includes fifteen examples that are not found in al-Suy?t?'s summary. This suggests that al-Zarkash? was not only rearranging the material from al-Ihk?m but also omitting examples and adding material from other sources or from his own investigation of the Qur'an. The probability that he preserves additional material from al-Ihk?m that al-Suy?t? has edited out of his abridgement seems low. Al-Suy?t?'s summary in all likelihood reproduces Ibn al-S??igh's 40 types of deviation in their original order. His summary may be somewhat condensed, in keeping with his general goals in al-Itq?n, to present a great deal of material in a comprehensive yet compact work. He may have left out some of Ibn al-Sa?igh's explanation of the examples he cites, or some ancillary or contrastive citations from the Qur'an. One suspects, though, that he did not leave out any of the main examples</page><page sequence="14">14 Journal of Qur'anic Studies of each type. Like al-Suy?t?, Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?'s aim was not to provide an exhaustive listing of the examples of each type of change, but rather to produce a comprehensive list of the different types of change; one or two examples for each would suffice. While al-Zarkashf s text is interesting as another treatment of this topic, al-Burh?n does not add much to our knowledge of the text of Ihk?m al-r?y. Together with al-Suy?t?'s text it confirms that the discussion of the debate between al-Farr?3 and Ibn Qutayba over the use of the dual number in S?rat al-Rahm?n was probably part of Ihk?m al-r?y itself; it has not been added independently by both al-Zarkash? and al-Suy?t?. Al-Zarkash?'s discussions of other sources in several of his points may have been part of the original text of Ihk?m al-r?y, but it is difficult to determine one way or the other. Ihk?m al-r?y cited other sources, including al-FamP's Mac?n? al-Qur??n, Ibn Qutayba's Taf sir ghar?b al-Qur??n, and probably Ab? cAl? al-F?ris?'s (d. 377/987) al Hujja fi cilal al-qir?3?t al-sabc, though this last may be cited in a comment made by al-Suy?t? that did not appear in Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s original text. It is likely that al-Suy?t? edited out many additional references to earlier authors. Al-Zarkash?'s text cites several further scholars: cAl? ibn Ism?c?l ibn S?da (d. 460/1068), referring explicitly to his dictionary al-Muhkam; Im?m al-Haramayn al-Juwayn? (d. 478/1085), referring to his work on jurisprudence, al-Burh?n fi usui al-fiqh; al-Zamakhshar?, author of the Kashsh?f cAbd Allah ibn al-Husayn al-cUkbari (d. 616/1219), author of ImW m? manna bihi al-Rahm?n min wuj?h al-icr?b wa'l-qir?^?t fijamlc al-Qur??n\ and 'a certain Maghrib?' whom I have not been able to identify. It may be that these last sources cited were not included in Ihk?m al-r?y, but were added by al-Zarkash? either directly or through other intermediate works. While M?ller's Reimprosa gives the impression that medieval Muslim critics failed to address the issue of 'poetic license' in the Qur'an directly, Ibn ?l-S?3igh's Ihk?m al r?y fi ahk?m al-?y proves this idea false, for the entire work is devoted to the specific topic of poetic license in the Qur'an and treats it with some sophistication. In addition, this and other works show that medieval critics developed important technical terms related to this phenomenon that have escaped M?ller entirely. In general, it is apparent that the analysis of the Qur'an and the attempt to differentiate it clearly from poetry on the one hand and sajc on the other led to the production of two or three parallel sets of terms for kindred concepts. Some Muslim scholars recognised the close relationship between these terms in a forthright manner, even while they upheld the distinction, and we have already mentioned al-J?hiz's observation that the Qur'an corresponds to the poetic dlw?n, the sura to the qaslda, the aya to the bayt, and the f?sila to the q?fiya. The term for a verse of poetry is bayt, and the term for the rhyming colon in sajc compositions is qarlna or sajca, parallel to the Qur'anic ?ya. The f?sila or ra3s ?ya, the verse-ending word in the Qur'anic text, corresponds to the q?fiya, the rhyme-word in poetry, or the sajc (pi. asj?c), the final rhyme-word in</page><page sequence="15">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray f? ahkam al-ay 15 the colon of sajc composition. Another term of paramount importance for the analysis of the Qur'an as a rhyming text is ric?yat al-f?sila or mur?c?t al-f?sila, which refers to the specific modifications of ordinary usage or choices that are made regarding word order, syntax, diction and forms of words in order to facilitate end-rhyme. Ric?yat al-f?sila is 'poetic license' in the context of the Qur'an, corresponding to dar?ra 'poetic license' in poetry.46 Of course, the latter term would be blasphemous, for dar?ra means literally 'need, necessity', which cannot properly apply to God or His speech, and became the technical term for dire need in Islamic law, as in the legal maxim al-dar?ra tub?hu al-mahz?r?t ('necessity makes prohibited things licit'). Ihk?m al-r?yfi ahk?m al-?y sets out to provide a comprehensive list of the types, each labelled hukm ('case'), of deviation from ordinary or expected usage (al-asl) that occur in the Qur'an for the sake of end-rhyme. Both Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf? and al Zarkash? establish what is ordinary or usage (al-asl) in some cases by referring to ayas in the Qur'an where the words or syntactic features in question appear in contexts that are not affected by the end-rhyme or are affected by a different end-rhyme. M?ller resorts to a similar procedure. In other cases, they do not provide Qur'anic parallels but identify ordinary usage with particular grammatical, syntactical and stylistic rules that the examples in question appear to violate. The types of deviation listed include distortions of the ends of words, grammatical changes such as treating a noun that is ordinarily treated as belonging to the weak declension (a 'diptote') as a noun of the strong declension (a 'triptote'), morphological changes including the alteration of a form such as cajlb ('strange, amazing') to cuj?b ('amazing, wondrous') and many deviations that have to do with syntax and word order, such as having a direct object precede the verb, having a pronoun precede its referent, and so on. In some cases, the deviation in question is presented as a matter of selection between possible forms that are all in common use, or are at least not exceedingly rare, as in using rashad or rushd ('right conduct') in contexts where each fits the pattern of the required rhyme-words. In other cases, however, the deviation produces a form that is not part of ordinary usage and appears to have been created ad hoc for the sake of rhyme, such as S?n?n for Sina3 or Sayn?0 (Mount Sinai). Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf? places all of these devations, indeed the entire topic of poetic license in the Qur'an, under an overarching principle which he terms mun?saba ('accordance, matching'). He suggests that mun?saba is a desirable effect in Arabic, so desirable, in fact, that ordinary rules in the language are broken in order to produce it. This manner of presenting the topic obviates the potential criticism that deviations for the sake of rhyme produce forms that do not properly belong to the language at all, resulting in an unacceptable contradiction, for the Qur'an states that it is in clear Arabic. Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?'s defense would be that while some of these forms are indeed created for the sake of a particular rhyme context and do not necessarily exist</page><page sequence="16">16 Journal of Qur'anic Studies otherwise in the language, the effect of mun?saba is itself an important part of the Arabic language, and all forms created on its account are therefore good Arabic. A similar strategy may be seen in the parallel argument about the occurrence of foreign words in the Qur'an. The occurrence of Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Persian, Ethiopian and South Arabian words in the Qur'an threatens to create a theological problem, for the Qur'an states that it is in plain Arabic, and their presence would appear to falsify that statement. The approach taken by many exegetes is to state that while these words are, in fact, of foreign origin, they had been fully assimilated into the Arabic language before the mission of the Prophet. Therefore, they belong rightfully to the Arabic language and do not present a contradiction. Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf? has also hedged his presentation of the effects of rhyme in another manner. At the end of the text, he admits that there may be other reasons, in addition to the desire to create 'accordance', for the deviations from ordinary usage that he points out. In other words, poetic license may combine with other desired rhetorical effects to produce the deviations noted. This serves as a defense against those who would accuse him of overstating his claims and attributing excessive influence to the exigencies of end-rhyme. What has the verdict of posterity regarding Ibn al-Sa3igh's analysis been? N?ldeke, as mentioned above, realised that Ibn al-S?3igh's text incorporated a sophisticated analysis, and describes his observations as 'fine', but remarks that he went 'much too far' in his analysis, meaning that he attributed too much influence to the exigencies of rhyme. In al-Hasn?w?'s view, Ibn al-S?3igh has treated the topic to exhaustion from the technical point of view but has ignored its aesthetic aspects. Other than these two assessments, little use has been made of Ihk?m al-r?y fl ahk?m al-?y, including, surprisingly, in M?ller's Untersuchungen zur Reimprosa im Koran. I find nearly all of Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s analyses convincing. A possible objection to his type XX, the interpretation of the aya fa-l? yukhrijannakum? min al-jannat? fa-tashq? (so let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou toil, Q- 20:117), is that the final verb 'toil' may refer to Adam alone and not to Eve as well, because men according to the Biblical account are supposed to toil after being expelled from the Garden, while women suffer the pains of childbirth. Alternatively, this statement may simply be in keeping with the emphasis on Adam as m?tonymie for the pair in most of the same passage. It is worth noting that the vocative preceding this statement is singular, y? Adam (O Adam), and that singular pronouns occur as well in the following two ayas: fa-quln? y? ?damu inna h?dh? caduwwun laka wa-li-zawjika fa-l? yukhrijannakum? min al-jannat? fa-tashq? * inna laka all? taj?ca flh? wa-l? tacr? * wa-annaka l? tazma?u flh? wa-l? tadh? * (Therefore we said: O Adam! This is an enemy to thee and to thy wife, so let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil. * It is granted to thee that thou hunger not therein nor are naked, * and that thou thirst not therein nor are exposed to the sun's heat, Q. 20:117-19).</page><page sequence="17">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 17 The consistent use of the singular in the address to Adam in this passage suggests to me that it is a stretch to argue that the dual was intended in the verb at the end of Q. 20:117. Otherwise, I do not find any reason to reject Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf?'s interpretations. Miiller's Reimprosa and Ibn al-S?3igh's Ihk?m al-r?y There has been only limited response to Miiller's work in scholarship in the European languages; I am not aware of any in Arabic. Neuwirth criticises M?ller for an insufficient presentation of the relevant instances of normal usage which she claims are violated for the sake of rhyme.47 Wansbrough reviewed M?ller's work, commenting, 'this study is a systematic compilation of the traditional evidence, hitherto adduced in a diffuse and perfunctory manner, to support the equally traditional assertion that Qur'anic style owes its idiosyncrasies to the fairly consistent imposition of a rhymed prose structure'.48 This assessment, I would argue, is flawed in three respects. First, M?ller's study cannot be characterised so easily as a systematic compilation of the traditional evidence, since it left out a great deal, especially the work of Ibn al-S??igh, even though it was readily available in al-Suy?tfs al-Itq?n fi cul?m al-Qur??n. Her conclusions result mainly from an independent investigation of the Qur'an and only occasionally address examples she found discussed in the sources she consulted. Second, it also provides many examples that are not discussed in traditional works. Third, Wansbrough's statement portrays the theses that the Qur'an is couched in rhymed prose and that rhyme exercised a profound effect on Qur'anic style as entirely commonplace in traditional exegesis, when they are in fact limited to a number of prominent authors, and are furthermore regularly denied, de emphasised, or ignored by the majority of exegetes. For example, al-Zamakhshar?'s famous tafslr, al-Kashsh?f, along with many others, regularly ignores the effect of rhyme in its interpretation of the structure of ayas, focusing instead on syntax and other rhetorical figures.49 Ibn al-Athfr, for one, takes al-Zamakhshari to task for this failure to pay attention to the exigencies of rhyme. Al-Zamakhshar? claims that the rhetorical figure of hysteron proteron (taqdxm wa-ta3kh?r) occurs for the sake of 'specification' (ikhtis?s), as in the aya iyy?ka nacbudu wa-iyy?ka nastac?n, literally You we worship, and You we approach for help (Q. 1:5). He explains that here the accusative pronoun iyy?ka precedes the verb on account of ikhtis?s, thus conveying the meaning, We worship You in particular or exclusively and we seek help from You in particular or exclusively. Ibn al-Athfr states that this is completely wrong and that the purpose of the unexpected word order is to preserve the end-rhyme in -n-. Similarly, according to Ibn al-Athfr, in Q. 69:30-1, khudh?hu fa-ghull?hu thumma'l-jah?ma sall?h (Take him, and fetter him, then cause him in Hell-fire to burn), the direct object jah?m (Hell-fire) is placed before sall?h (cause him to burn) for the sake of preserving the end-rhyme and not for ikhtis?s. According to Ibn al-Athir,</page><page sequence="18">18 Journal of Qur'anic Studies one of the main goals of taqd?m wa-ta?kh?r is to preserve the aesthetic appeal of the rhyme and rhythm of the sajc.50 Ibn al-Ath?r is not presenting a common, majority opinion, but finds it necessary to argue at some length against al-Zamakhshari and other exegetes who regularly ignore considerations of rhyme and rhythm in their analyses of Qur'anic ayas, with the result that they, on occasion, propose convoluted and inadequate interpretations of ayas where end-rhyme has had a significant effect on word order, syntax, and the like. Wansbrough goes on to criticise the examples M?ller adduces as cases where the morphology and syntax of ayas has deviated from ordinary usage for the sake of end rhyme, suggesting that there are other, more compelling rhetorical causes of said idiosyncrasies. He does not provide any specific examples. One supposes that he would respond as did N?ldeke to the example, but Ibn al-S?3igh would, in this instance, have out-flanked the criticism, for, at the end of the treatise he remarks that the rhetorical goal of 'matching' (mun?saba) may not be the only factor producing the particular effects he describes; there may be other rhetorical considerations behind them at the same time. M?ller's text does not make a similar disclaimer. One may describe M?ller's work as identifying fifteen types of change that fall into four major categories: morphological, syntactic, grammatical and lexicographical: 1) The suppression of the final syllable -in in nouns or adjectives of the forms f?cil, mutaf?cil, etc. that have a weak letter (w or y) as the final consonant (6 examples), (P- 5); 2) The lengthening of a final short -a &gt; -? in the accusative case of definite nouns (4 examples) and in the subjunctive of the imperfect verb (2 examples), (p. 5); 3) The suppression of the first-person possessive suffix -I (20 examples), (p. 5); 4) Modification of the first-person possessive suffix -f to -iyah (4 examples), (p. 5); 5) Modification of the third person feminine pronoun hiya to hiyah (Q. 101:10), (p. 5); 6) Morphological changes (20 examples), (pp. 13-78); 7) Prepositional phrases that are preposed, occurring before the elements on which they depend. M?ller divides these into three sub-categories, the first involving verbal sentences (63 examples), the second involving nominal sentences (53 examples), and the third involving verbal adjectives with dependent prepositional phrases (81 examples), but they essentially work on the same principle, (pp. 78-128); 8) Substitution of a perfect verb for an imperfect verb (5 examples), (pp. 128-9); 9) Substitption of an imperfect verb for a perfect verb (3 examples), (pp. 129-30);</page><page sequence="19">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 19 10) Substitution of a dual form for a singular form (2 examples), (pp. 130-3); 11) Substitution of a dual form for a plural form (38 examples, mainly in Q. 55, S?rat al-Rahm?n), (pp. 133-5); 12) Substitution of a feminine form for a masculine form, such as akhdhatan r?biya (Q. 69:10) for an underlying form akhdh, (pp. 135-6); 13) Substitution of 'rare words' (seltene W?rter). This category may actually be viewed as three separate types (types 13, 14 and 15 here), though she presents it as one. The first includes distorted words such as S?n?n (Q. 95:2) for Sayn?3 (of Sm?3), Ily?sln (Q. 37:130) for Ily?s, and ghisl?n (Q. 69:36) for ghus?la; 14) The second involves the use of rare or unusual forms such as Mr c?n (Q. 44:54; Q. 56:22) for an underlying h?r al-cuy?n, him ('mad with thirst'), a plural of ahyam (masc.) or haym?0 (fem.), tar?q (Q. 75:26) for al-tar?q?, plural of tarquwa; 15) The third involves the use of particular emphatic forms such as kubb?r? (Q. 71:22) for kab?r? (pp. 136^45). Contrary to Wansbrough's assessment, I find nearly all of M?ller's analyses convincing, with only a handful of exceptions. She interprets al-maghribayn (the two settings) in rabbu'l-mashriqayni wa-rabbu'l-maghribayn (Q. 55:17) as a subsitution for the singular al-maghrib ('the setting (of the Sun)').51 I would suggest, however, that the dual here likely denotes the settings of the Sun and the Moon, just as the plurals mash?riq and magh?rib (Q. 70:40) can be taken to refer to the risings and settings of the Sun, the Moon and the five remaining planets.52 This interpretation is corroborated, to some extent, by the Qur'an's combined reference to the regular movements of the Sun and the Moon in such ayas as Q. 55:4, wa'l-shamsu wa'l qamaru bi-husb?n (The sun and the moon move according to a calculation) and Q. 6:96, ... wa-jacala'l-layla sakanan wa'l-shamsa wal-qamara husb?nan '... He made the night a period of rest, and the sun and the moon a [means of] calculation'. M?ller's category of lexical changes, involving 'rare words', actually includes words of what should properly be considered three distinct types. The first includes distorted words such as S?n?n (Q. 95:2) for Sayn?3 [or S?n?3] (Sinai), Ily?sln (Q. 37:130) for Ily?s (Elias), and ghisl?n (Q. 69:36) for ghus?la ('wash water'). The second involves the use of rare or unusual forms such as Mr c?n (Q. 44:54; Q. 56:22) for an underlying h?r al-cuy?n; him ('mad with thirst', pl.), a plural of ahyam (masc.) or haym?3 (fem.); and tar?q (Q. 75:26) for al-tar?q?, a plural of tarquwa. The third involves the use of particular emphatic forms such as kubb?r? (Q. 71:22) for kab?r?. I would reject her interpretation of Mr c?n, in the section on unusual words, on the grounds that c?n should not be considered an anomalous form, being the regular plural, of the morphological pattern/wc/, of acyan, cayn?3 ('large-eyed').53 The word him that she includes in the same section is also a regular form, the plural of ahyam, also of the</page><page sequence="20">20 Journal of Qur'anic Studies pattern fucl\ she recognises this to an extent, but still includes it as an unusual word that occurs in the Qur'anic aya for the sake of rhyme.54 The word al-tar?ql would also be the ordinary plural of tarquwa; the only deviation from ordinary usage is the suppression of the final -? in al-tar?q, which is a separate type of change.55 In my view, the example kubb?r?, also included in this section, should properly have been treated in the section on morphological alterations.56 Ihk?m al-r?y addresses most of the categories that M?ller's analysis covers. Ibn al-Sa?igh does not devote one category to morphological changes per se, something that will be discussed further below, but he discusses some types of change that should be recognised as falling under this category, such as the substitution of an active participle for a passive participle and vice versa. Most of M?ller's other categories may be related to categories of deviation from ordinary usage listed in Ihk?m al-r?y: Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?'s types 6-10, 12, 22-3, 28, 37, 39-40. Several of Ibn al-S??igh's types treat changes in word order, but he does not have a category devoted to changes in the placement of prepositional phrases like that which takes up a large part of M?ller's book. Presumably he would have viewed her examples as a sub-category of his type 1, the placement of a grammatical regimend before its regent, but the main examples he gives involve direct objects, which she does not address. Reimprosa thus presents the equivalents of twelve of Ibn al-S??igh's categories of deviation of ordinary usage, but does not cite his work or al-Suy?t?'s Itq?n as a relevant source. Moreover, M?ller's work effectively omits 28 of the categories of change treated in Ihk?m al-r?y: types 1-5, 7, 11, 13-21, 24-7, 29-36, and 38. Cognate Substitution In my view, the most important contribution of M?ller's study is the section on morphological changes for the sake of rhyme. Here, she presents many examples that are not found in Ihk?m al-r?y or other works of traditional Islamic scholarship, and recognition of these examples helps provide an improved understanding of the Qur'anic text's meaning. Students of Arabic and other Semitic languages are taught that in the Semitic root-and-pattern system, each morphological pattern, together with the basic meaning inherent in the combination of root consonants, produces a distinct sense. That sense is particular to the given word of that pattern; alteration of the pattern, even while preserving the original root consonants, produces an attendant alteration of meaning. However, M?ller's examples show that a cognate of a different pattern can be substituted for the original word, with the result that the new word in fact conveys the same meaning as the old, despite the change in pattern. In some cases, the substituted forms are common words that ordinarily convey different meanings; in others, they are seemingly created ad hoc, for the particular passage in question, and are not otherwise known words. As these forms are liable to be</page><page sequence="21">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 21 misunderstood by readers and commentators who do not realise that they have been produced for the sake of rhyme, attention to this type of alteration is of great relevance for the interpretation and translation of the Qur'an. As noted above, M?ller's work explains twenty instances of morphological alteration for the sake of rhyme. With regard to Q. 105:2, a-lam yajcal kaydahum fi tadl?l (Did He not cause their plot to go awry?), M?ller argues, in my estimation correctly, that the noun tadl?l here conveys the meaning of its more common cognate dalai. The noun tadl?l would ordinarily mean 'the act of sending something astray' when the meaning required by context is simply dalai ('the state of being astray'). It is telling that tadl?l occurs only in this aya, and in rhyme position, whereas the expression fi dalai occurs many times in the Qur'an. In M?ller's view, the 'original' term dalai here has been altered or modified for the sake of end-rhyme.57 The argument is convincing, as it explains the meaning of the aya and brings it in line with Qur'anic idiom as attested by many other passages. M?ller's examples of this type of change are all convincing, in my view, but her list is not exhaustive. She explains that she has omitted an important class of rare terms such as al-hutama (Q. 104:4) that may be explained as instances of similar morphological change.58 This is true - most of the rare terms used to describe Paradise or Hell, such as saqar (Q. 54:48; Q. 74:26, 27, 42), laz? (Q. 70:15) and h?wiya (Q. 101:10) for Hell or Hllly?n (Q. 83:18-19) for Paradise, occur in rhyme-position and appear to be modified forms involving common root-consonant combinations. Furthermore, a thorough investigation of the Qur'an reveals other instances similar to the ones M?ller presents. One example is the word taqw?m that, in my view, is a cognate substitution for an underlying term qaw?m ('form'). It occurs in Q. 95:4: la-qad khalaqn?'l-ins?na fi ahsani taqw?m (We created man in the best form). The word taqw?m would ordinarily mean 'the act of formation, straightening out, evaluation', when the meaning required by context is 'form' instead. While qaw?m does not occur in the Qur'an, the substition is supported to a degree by comparison with the Qur'anic usage of the parallel term s?ra (pi. suwar) also 'form', as opposed to the cognate verb of the form faccala, yufaccilu, taf?lan (measure II): sawwara, yusawwiru, tasw?r ('to form'), as well as the related active participle musawwir ('one who forms'), which also appear in contexts related to the creation of mankind. The measure II verb occurs four times in the Qur'an, including the following ayas: Q. 3:6, huwa'lladh? yusawwirukum fi'1-arh?mi kayfa yash?Du (He is the One who forms you in the wombs as He pleases) and Q. 7:11, wa-la-qad khalaqn?kum thumma sawwarn?kum thumma quln? lVl-mal??ikatV sjud? li-Adam (We created you, then formed you, then said to the angels: prostrate to Adam). God is al-musawwir, 'the One Who forms' mankind (Q. 59:24). However, when the meaning 'form' is required by context, s?ra or the plural suwar appears, and not the verbal noun tasw?r. Moreover, the noun s?ra and its plural suwar occur in constructions that resemble those found in Q. 95:4 quite closely: wa-sawwarakum</page><page sequence="22">22 Journal of Qur'anic Studies fa-ahsana suwarakum ... (He formed you, and He made your forms excellent, Q. 40:64; Q. 64:3). The preposition fi ('in') that occurs in Q. 95:4 in connection with taqwlm also occurs with s?ra in Q. 82:7-8, alladhl khalaqaka fa-saww?ka fa-cadalak * fi ayyi s?ra?n m? sh?Ja rakkabak (Who created you, then fashioned you, then proportioned you. * He cast you in any form He wished). Q. 95:4 is parallel in meaning to these last examples; in the phrase fi ahsani taqwlm (in the best act of formation), taqwlm stands in place of qaw?m by cognate substitution, and the phrase actually means fi ahsani qaw?m ('in the best form'), equivalent to the hypothetical phrase fi ahsani s?ra. This is one example of many that could be added to those M?ller has explained. An exhaustive treatment of cognate substitution in the Qur'an would include many further examples that her text does not address. Neither M?ller's study nor even Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf?'s text reveals that Arabic technical terms exist for the types of morphological modifications that they describe. The most common of these is cadl, which shows up regularly in grammatical discussions of 'diptotes', i.e. the weak declension of nouns. Arabic grammatical manuals commonly explain that nouns take the weak declension if they have any combination of two or more out of a list of nine characteristics, and one of these is cadl ('alteration') or al-cadl can slgha il? ukhr? ('alteration from one morphological pattern to another'). Grammatical texts commonly cite as examples the male given name cUmar, which has been altered from c?mir, the female given name Qat?mi, which has been altered from Q?tima, ukhar (Others'), from ?khar?n, and so on.59 Al-Shar?f al-Jurj?n? (d. 816/1413) defines cadl in the terminology of grammarians as 'a noun's deviation from its original pattern to another pattern' ('khur?j al-ism can slghatihi al-asliyya il? sigha ukhr?').60 Another term used for the same concept is naql ('transfer'), likewise referring to a move from one morphological pattern (wazn or slgha) to another.61 This type of alteration is exactly the type of change M?ller describes. M?ller does not assign a particular term to these morphological modifications, but refers to the underlying forms being morphologically changed or modified (morphologisch variiert, morphologisch ver?ndert, morphologisch abgewandelt).62 Wansbrough terms them 'morphological distortions'.63 In my view, 'cognate substitution' is a preferable term for this phenomenon, since the alteration is not regular from one example to the next and is not a gradual process that proceeds in stages. Moreover, the resulting form is often quite distant from the original, as when tadlll occurs in place of dal?l, and is in most cases a common, regular form, rather than a distorted version of the original, as one sees in euphemistic distortions, for example, such as wayh for wayl ('woe, affliction'). Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf? does not refer to cognate substitution as one category, but a number of his examples may be seen to fit under that general rubric. In his type XVII, he refers to the use of rare terms for the sake of rhyme in place of more common</page><page sequence="23">Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 23 words, as in Q. 53:22, qismatun d?z? (an unfair division) as opposed to qismatun j??ira ('an unjust division'); Q. 104:4, la-yunbadhanna fi'l-hutama (He will be thrown into the Crusher); Q. 74:26, sa-usl?hi saqar (I will cause him to burn in Hell-fire); Q. 70:15, innah? laz? (It is Flames); or Q. 101:9, fa-ummuhu h?wiya (then his resort will be an Abyss) as opposed to jahhanam (Gehenna) or al-n?r ('the Fire'), to match the verse-final words of those suras. In the last example in particular, one may argue that this is a clear case of cognate substitution, h?wiya standing in for huwwa or mahw? ('abyss').64 His type XXVII, using an emphatic form such as qadlr ('powerful') (passim) or callm ('knowing') for al-q?dir ('able, capable', Q. 6:65) and c?limu'l-ghayb ('knower of the Unseen') (passim), or nasly? ('forgetful', Q. 19:64) for n?siy? ('having forgotten'), involves cognate substitution, and quite similar is his type XXVIII, preferring one emphatic form over another, as in using cuj?b ('amazing, wondrous', Q. 38:5), for cajlb ('strange', cf. Q. 11:72; Q. 50:2). Also clearly belonging to the general category of cognate substitution are his types XXXI and XXXII, use of a passive participle in the place of an active participle, and vice versa, as in hij?ban mast?r? (a concealed barrier, Q. 17:45) for s?tir? ('concealing'); k?na wacduhu ma?tly? (His promise will be arrived at, Q. 19:61) for ?tiy? ('will arrive'); clshatin r?diya (an approving life, Q. 69:21 and Q. 101:7) for mardiyya ('agreeable'); and m??un d?fiq (pouring water, Q. 86:6) for madfuq ('poured'). One assumes that Ibn al-S?3igh al-Hanaf? would have recognised cognate substitution as a principle, but he chose to present several distinct types rather than an overarching category. He may have done this for various reasons of ideology or literary critical judgement; stating that al-hutama is a product of cognate substitution, for example, implies that one can determine what the original was, such as al-hatt?ma or al-h?tima, and in the absence of a Qur'anic or other prooftext Ibn al-Sa?igh may have been reluctant to do this. In contrast to Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?, a number of medieval rhetoricians, including Diy?3 al-D?n ibn al-Ath?r, identified cognate substition as an important overarching category and discussed it in their works. Ironically, though, while they appear to have understood that this phenomenon actually occurs in the Qur'an, they lead up to the point where a clear statement to that effect would have been expected or required, and then fall silent. The absence is glaring enough that one suspects either that they are engaging in self-censorship, avoiding voicing their opinions directly for fear of accusations of doctrinal infractions, or that they intend to convey the idea to their readers through hints or suggestions without stating it outright. The earliest rhetorician in this group is Ab? Hil?l al-cAskar? (d. 395/1005), who discusses Qur'anic sajc in Kit?b al-sin?catayn, completed in Ramadan 394/June-July 1004. Al-cAskar? belongs to the camp of rhetoricians who hold that sajc is meritorious, that the Qur'an contains a great deal of sajc, and that it is not wrong to apply the term sajc to the sacred text. For example, he cites the opening ayas of S?rat al- c?diy?t as an example</page><page sequence="24">24 Journal of Qur'anic Studies of excellent sajc. As part of his proof of the exalted status of sajc, he makes the point that the Prophet used sajc in his own speech, as in the following address, preserved in a Hadfth report: 'ayyuh?'l-n?s afsih?'l-sal?m * wa-atcim?'l-tac?m * wa-sil?'l-arh?m * wa-sall? bi'l-layl wa'l-n?su niy?m * tadkhul?'l-jannata bi-sal?m *' (Oh people! If you spread peace, provide food, visit relatives, and pray at night when all are asleep, then you will safely enter Paradise').66 He then makes the additional point that the Prophet not only used sajc in his speech, but actually changed the forms of words for the sake of sajc, suggesting its importance as an eloquent style of speech. He writes, 'rubbam? ghayyara al-kalima can wajhih? IVl-muw?zana bayn al-alf?z wa-itb?c al-kalima akhaw?tih?9 ('He on occasion changed a word from its ordinary form in order to create matching forms among the words, and to have one word follow its counterparts').67 He then provides examples of such changes, quoting two Hadfth reports that would be cited frequently in subsequent texts. The first is a prophylactic charm the Prophet uttered; other sources report that it was for one of his grandsons, Hasan and Husayn, or both of them: 'uc?dhuhu min al-h?mma * wa'l-s?mma * wa kulli caynin l?mma *' ( ask protection for him from the disaster, from that which poisons, and from every calamitous eye'). Al-cAskar? explains that by l?mma (literally 'gathering') in the charm the Prophet intended mulimma ('disastrous, calamitous'). The second Hadfth report is a statement the Prophet addressed to a caravan of camels setting out on a trading trip: Hrjicna ma?z?r?t * ghayra maJj?r?t *' ('Return laden down * not hired out *'). Al-cAskar? explains that the Prophet intended mawz?r?t ('laden down'), which derives from wizr ('burden'), but said ma?zur?t instead in order to create matching patterns between the rhyme words and proper end-rhyme Cqasdan li'1-taw?zun wa-sihhat al-sajci). Al-cAskari concludes, 'all of this indicates the excellence of sajc composition on condition that it be free of stiltedness and devoid of arbitrary diction'.68 In other words, al-cAskan claims that in these statements preserved in the Hadfth, the Prophet changed the forms of words for the sake of rhyme and rhythmical pattern, using l?mma in place of mulimma and ma3zur?t instead of mawz?r?t. These examples show, in his view, the importance attached to preserving the parallelism between adjacent cola; it is not simply a matter of modified word order, but the distortion of words, which one would generally suppose does violence to the meaning. The Prophet was willing to introduce such drastic modifications into his speech for the sake of sajc. Al-cAskar? hastens to point out that the Prophet did not attempt to speak in sajc whenever possible, for recorded reports indicate that he chose not to use the form when it may have been expected. He reports that the Prophet made the statement, 'ma yudrlki annahu shahld lacallahu k?na yatakallamu bim? l? yacn?hi wa-yabkhulu bim? l? yanfacuhu' ('How do you know that he will be a martyr? Perhaps he spoke of matters that did not concern him, or withheld out of avarice wealth that would not benefit him').69 Al-cAskari comments that had the Prophet ended this statement not with the phrase bim? l? yanfacuhu ('wealth that would not benefit him'), but instead with the equivalent phrase bim? l? yughn?hu, it would have</page><page sequence="25">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-rayfi ahkam al-ay 25 been sajc. The opportunity to create rhyme in this statement was so obvious, in al-c Askari's view, that the Prophet must have intentionally avoided it.70 Following the structure of Ab? Hil?l al-cAskari's discussion, the reader might suspect that cognate substitution also occurs in the Qur'an, but al-?Askar? does not state this explicitly. If cognate substitution occurs in everyday sajc, and even in the speech of the Prophet, then the next logical step would be to state that it also occurs in the Qur'an. In al Mathal al-s?3ir, this omission is even more glaring. Diy?3 al-D?n ibn al-Ath?r is also aware that in sajc, the forms of words in end-rhyme position are occasionally modified for the sake of rhyme. His discussion resembles that of al-cAskar? but is more fleshed out. Like al-c Askari, he stops short of saying that the forms of words in the Qur'an were changed for the sake of rhyme. He gives the same example of Prophetic Had?th that al-c Askari cites, about entering Paradise in peace, and also the following text: '... al-istihy?3u min All?hi an tahfaz,a'l-ra3sa wa-m? wac? * wa'l-batna wa-m? haw? * wa-tadhkura'l-mawta wa'l-bil? * wa-man ar?da'l-?khira taraka zlnata'l-hay?ta'l-duny? *' ('Modesty before God is that you preserve the head and that which it holds, and the belly and what it contains, and keep in mind death and inevitable decline. Whoever wishes for the afterlife should abandon the adornments of this life'). Ibn al-Ath?r then cites the two Had?th reports that al-cAskari cited as examples of cognate substitution, including 'ucldhuhu min al-h?mma * wa'l-s?mma * wa-kulli caynin l?mma *' ( ask protection for him from the disaster, from that which poisons, and from every calamitous eye'). He comments that the Prophet '... intended, rather, mulimma ('calamitous') because it derives from the verb alamma ('to afflict, befall'). Something is said to be mulimm ('calamitous')'. Regarding the statement from Had?th, a ma3zur?t * ghayra ma3j?r?t *' ('Return laden down, not hired out'), Ibn al-Ath?r explains, 'He intended rather mawz?r?t but said ma3zur?t because of the occurrence of ma3j?r?t, seeking to establish parallelism and end-rhyme (sajc). This is one of the things that indicate the merit of sajc.,J1 Ibn al-Ath?r does not say that this type of distortion occurs in the Qur'an, though one may argue that that would have been the next logical step. An examination of the structure of Ibn al-Ath?r's argument about sajc suggests that he has supressed a major point on purpose. Logical Structure of Ibn al-Ath?r's Argument for the Merit of sajc 1. Argument from Had?th: A. Contrary to what many say, the Prophet Muhammad did not denounce sajc in 'the had?th of the Fetus', in which he is reported to have questioned, 'a-safan ka-sajc al-kuhh?ri ('Was that sajc like the sajc of the soothsayers?'). B. The Prophet used sajc in his own speech. C. Sajc is so meritorious that the Prophet changed the forms of words in his speech to achieve the end-rhyme and rhythmical parallelism characteristic of sajc.</page><page sequence="26">26 Journal of Qur'anic Studies 2. Argument from the Qur'an: A. Contrary to what many say, sajc occurs in the Qur'an. B. Sajc is used frequently in the Qur'an, and many suras, such as S?rat al-Qamar (Q. 54), are couched entirely in sajc. [C. The forms of words in the Qur'an are also changed to achieve the end-rhyme and rhythmical parallellism characteristic of sajc.] Ibn al-Ath?r's treatment of sajc in Had?th is logically parallelled by his treatment of sajc in the Qur'an. Consideration of the two arguments in parallel suggests that he has omitted a crucial point: cognate substitution occurs in the Qur'an, just as it occurs in Had?th. One may make the same claim regarding al-cAskan's argument for the merit of sajc in Kit?b al-Sin?catayn, but the omission is more glaring in Ibn al-Ath?r's more detailed discussion in al-Mathal al-s?3 ir. Ibn Hijja al-Hamaw? (d. 837/1434) presents a similar discussion with several of the same examples in his work, Khiz?nat al-adab, a rhetorical treatise in the form of a commentary on his own badViyya - a poem in which each verse demonstrates a distinct rhetorical figure - that he completed in 826/1423. He makes the overarching point that sajc is based on the principle of change in the rhyme word ('al-sajc mabnl cal?'l-taghy?f).72 He then mentions three types of change that occur for the sake of rhyme, giving examples from the Qur'an: im?la of an alif with an underlying w?w, as in wa'1-duh? * wa'l-layli idh? saj? (Q. 93:1-2), where the final -? in duh? would not ordinarily undergo im?la; the ellipsis of a suffixed object pronoun, as in Q. 93:3, m? waddacaka rabbuka wa-m? qal? (Thy Lord has not forsaken you, nor does He despise), where the underlying construction would have been wa-m? qal?ka ('nor does He despise you'); and treating a noun that ordinarily takes the weak declension as a strong declension noun, as in qaw?rlr? (Q. 76:15, 16), which should ordinarily end in short -a (qaw?rlr?) and not in -an &gt; -?. Ibn Hijja then produces examples of cognate substitution but, like al-cAskar? and Ibn al-Athir, provides examples only from the Had?th of the Prophet, and not from the Qur'an. He gives the two examples discussed above but also adds a third: 'dac? al-Habashata m? wadac?kum wa-utruk? al-Turka m? tarak?kum' ('Leave the Abyssinians be as long as they bid you farewell, and leave the Turks alone as long as they leave you alone'). Ibn Hijja explains that the verb wadac?kum in the first colon would ordinarily have been w?dac?kum ('they bode you farewell') in the form f?cala (measure III), but was changed to facala (measure I) in order to match tarakukum in the second colon.73 Ibn Hijja then makes a cryptic statement that may refer to Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?'s work: have heard that a certain scholar of chancery prose authored a work on the rules governing faw?siV.74 The fact that he uses the phrase ahk?m al-faw?sil might suggest an allusion to Ibn al-S?3igh's Ihk?m al-?y fi ahk?m al-?y; however, Ibn al-S??igh was not primarily a professional</page><page sequence="27">Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanafl's Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 27 secretary, though he was an expert in rhetoric, and the designation may refer to yet another author. Another example of cognate substition occurs in the Prophetic had?th 'khayru'1-m?li sikkatun ma?b?ra * aw muhratun ma?m?ra *' (The best of wealth is a pierced coin, or a fertile mare'). Here, the form ma3m?ra has been altered from the original form mu3mara, meaning 'fertile and producing abundant offspring'.75 This makes a total of four statements attributed to the Prophet that exhibit cognate substitution for the sake of rhyme and rhythmical parallelism. It is not difficult to imagine why these critics may have wished to avoid stating bluntly that the forms of words in the Qur'an have been altered for the sake of rhyme. The claim that cognate substitution occurs in the Qur'an risks blasphemy, for it implies that God distorted Arabic words, in effect going against the understanding that the Qur'an is an example of linguistic perfection. Just as it became important to deny that the Qur'an contained foreign vocabulary, it also would be important to deny that some of the words in the Qur'an are not true Arabic but words that have been distorted ad hoc for the sake of rhyme and parallelism. It seems inconceivable that Ibn al-Ath?r, given his awareness or cognate substitution in Prophetic Had?th, could not have been aware of it in the Qur'an. He stopped short of saying this explicitly for fear of repercussions, preferring to leave it unstated, yet he apparently intended that it be understood by perspicacious readers. Sulaym?n ibn cAbd al-Qaw? al-T?fl represents something of an exception in this series of rhetoricians, for he cites one concrete instance of cognate substitution in the Qur'an, despite the fact that his discussion of sajc relies heavily on that of Ibn al-Ath?r. Al-Mathal al-s?'ir was the main source of al-T?f?'s work on rhetoric of the Qur'an, al-Iks?r fi cilm al-tafs?r, and this is particularly true of the section of al-lkslr devoted to sajc, which repeats many of Ibn al-Ath?r's statements nearly verbatim. Like Ibn al-Ath?r, al-T?fl makes the point that sajc must be meritorious because it occurs in the speech of eloquent men, in the ah?d?th of the Prophet, and in the Qur'an. Like Ibn al-Ath?r, he reports that in some rhymed prose statements by the Prophet, the forms of words have been changed for the sake of end-rhyme (li-mur?c?t al-sajc). He cites the Had?th report 'irjicna ma?z?r?t * ghayra ma?j?r?t *' ('Return laden down, not hired out'), where ma?z?r?t occurs for mawz?r?t, and also, though with somewhat different wording, the prophylactic charm the Prophet uttered for his grandsons Hasan and Husayn, 'ucidhukum? bi-kalim?ti'll?hi'l-t?mma * min kulli shayt?nin wa-h?mma * wa-min kulli caynin l?mma *' ( ask protection for you with God's perfect words, from every demon and disaster, and every calamitous eye'), where l?mma occurs for mulimma.76 Al-T?fl then proceeds to the next logical step, providing an example from the Qur'an where the original form of a word has been changed for the sake of rhyme and rhythm. He cites the Qur'anic phrase ... wa-iq?ma'al-sal?ti wa-lt?3 a'l-zak?t</page><page sequence="28">28 Journal of Qur'anic Studies (Q. 21:73). He explains that the original form of iq?m is iq?ma, and the fact that such changes of form occur in the Qur'an is definitive proof of the stylistic excellence of sajc.77 Unlike Ab? Hil?l al-cAskar?, Ibn al-Ath?r, and Ibn Hijja, al-T?f? does not stop short of presenting a Qur'anic example of this phenomenon, and even stresses its excellence. The fact that al-T?f? includes the example at this particular point in his discussion, while following Ibn al-Athfr's presentation very closely on the whole, confirms the conjecture that Ibn al-Ath?r deliberately suppressed something but intended it to be understood. It is worth noting, however, that even in al-T?f?'s case, the example he presents is not as dramatic as other examples he could have chosen, for iq?m and iq?ma differ only slightly in form, and iq?m occurs in connection with a case of verse-internal rhyme and parallelism, rather than an instance of end rhyme. The discussions of al-cAskan, Ibn al-Ath?r, al-T?f?, and Ibn Hijja show that some medieval scholars of Arabic rhetoric were aware of the phenomenon of cognate modification or substitution for the sake of rhyme. Nevertheless, they were somewhat hesitant to call attention to the fact that this phenomenon occurs frequently in the Qur'an. Their discussions contrast with Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al ?y, which provides clear examples of cognate substition but which do not label them as such, avoiding the creation of a major category. In any case, while these scholars were accomplished Arabists and careful students of the Qur'anic text, and while Ibn al-S?Digh's work is an insightful analysis of the phenomenon of poetic license in the Qur'an, cognate substitution has been the subject of only limited attention on the part of pre-modern Muslim authors. M?ller's work, though it is not exhaustive, provides a larger collection of instances of this phenomenon than found elsewhere in the traditon, including many not generally recognised as belonging to the category. To address the topic of 'poetic license' in the Qur'an was to come close to blasphemy, even more than the mere claim that the Qur'an contained sajc, for doing so runs the risk of claiming that form in the Qur'an has the upper hand over meaning, as if linguistic constraints were controlling God. Indeed, the Arabic term for poetic license is dar?ra ('necessity'), which cannot properly be applied to the Divine. After all, the Qur'an avoids stating that God rested after creating the world in six days (Q. 50:38), for that would imply the imperfection of anthropomorphic limitations. How could He then be described as 'needing' to change His speech? As al-Qurtub? (d. 671/1273) puts it, 'wa-amm? al-shicr fa-mawdic dar?ra bi-khil?f al-Qur??n fa-innahu afsah al-lugh?t wa-l? dar?ra fihV ('Poetry is subject to "necessity" (instances of poetic license), in contrast with the Qur'an, which is the most eloquent type of speech. "Necessity" does not occur in it').78 The problem is particularly glaring with cognate substitution, where the sharp contrast between forms forces one to admit, after a fashion, that the text of the Qur'an says one thing and means another.</page><page sequence="29">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 29 The opposite view is usually assumed about the Qur'an. Since it is God's speech, its contents in all instances represent God's intended meaning, and a change in the text represents a change in intended meaning, however slight. On this logic, al-Zarkash? presents a discussion of the change of morphological pattern that contradicts the authors just cited, for, as he argues, when a word of one pattern is changed to a 'higher' form - i.e. an expanded or augmented form - there must be a concomitant augmentation in meaning.79 The term he uses in this discussion for a change of form is naql ('transfer'), rather than cadl Perhaps cadl, for him, would have indicated a lesser distortion, in which the meaning could stay the same, while naql denotes a more radical change. He writes: 'Know that when a word is of a particular morphological pattern and is then transferred to another morphological pattern, higher than the first, it must contain more meaning than it contained to begin with, because words are indicators of meanings, and if they are augmented, the meanings are necessarily augmented'.80 There is therefore a contradiction between his analysis and the examples of cognate substitution provided by Ab? Hil?l al-cAskar?, Ibn al-Ath?r and the others, for they claim that a change in pattern occurs for the sake of rhyme, while the meaning actually remains unchanged. When l?mma is substituted for mulimma, according to them, the original meaning is not somehow augmented, or diminished, as the case may be. When al-Zarkash? states that a pattern is transferred to another pattern 'higher than the first', perhaps he means to exclude cases in which there is a change in pattern, but where the new pattern is on the same level, so to speak. In such cases, there may not be a necessary augmentation of meaning. In any case, several of al Zarkash?'s examples are not completely convincing; one may argue, for example, that muqtadir in Q. 54:42 is an equivalent of q?dir or qadlr and does not convey any additional meaning, but simply denotes 'powerful'. His discussion reveals an important tension in the interpretation of the Qur'anic text, one that is also seen in the discussion of the existence of true synonyms or variant expressions (wuj?h wa nazaJir) in the Qur'an: since the Qur'an is the pinnacle of linguistic excellence and God's address to mankind, there is a strong tendency to claim that the form must convey God's intended meaning very precisely. Any variation in form must signal a variation in meaning. Conclusion A number of medieval exegetes and scholars of rhetoric were aware of the profound effects that end-rhyme exerted on the text of the Qur'an. This group included particularly those scholars who freely admitted that the Qur'an contained passages couched in sajc and recognised that a large portion of the Qur'an was in this form, including entire suras. In some cases, scholars were reluctant to label explicitly all the types of modifications and deviations from ordinary usage that occurred in the text; others were less circumspect. Examination of their works shows that medieval Muslim</page><page sequence="30">30 Journal of Qur'anic Studies scholars had developed special terms for 'poetic license' in the Qur'an: ric?yat al-f?sila, mur?c?t al-f?sila, ric?yat al-faw?sil, but also al-mun?saba, mun?sabat ru3?s al-?y, tan?sub ru??s al-?y. They investigated this phenomenon by examining the rhyming ayas of the Qur'an with great care and identifying deviations from ordinary or expected Arabic usage, which they termed al-asl. The most sustained discussion of poetic license in the Qur'an that has come down to us is that of the eighth/fourteenth-century Egyptian scholar Ibn al-S??igh al-Hanaf?, Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y, which is not extant in complete form but is available through the summary of al-Suy?ti in al-Itq?n fi cul?m al-Qur??n and also through the relevant section of al-Burh?n fi cul?m al-QurD?n by al-Zarkash?, who does not summarise the work but draws on it extensively for his own discussion. Despite N?ldeke's protest that he went much too far, Ibn al-S?3igh's analysis is on the whole very valuable and insightful, and it includes many types of modification of which M?ller, whose 1969 study Untersuchungen zur Reimprosa im Koran was devoted to the same topic, was unaware. In some cases, these and other scholars proceed in their investigation of ric?yat al-f?sila in the same manner that M?ller does: by comparing cases where the words and constructions in question occur in rhyme position to other cases in the Qur'anic text where they do not occur in rhyme position, or occur in other rhyme contexts. In other cases, their assessment of ordinary usage derives from the understanding of general syntactic and stylistic rules of Arabic language and composition. Neuwirth has remarked with regard to M?ller's study that not enough work was done to establish the nature of ordinary usage. The medieval literary critics did not do any more justice to this than M?ller did, and in some cases far less. Notwithstanding, it is my view that their judgements are justified in nearly all cases, and that a more substantial effort to define ordinary usage would not change their conclusions significantly. In addition, medieval critics were also aware of the morphological modifications of rhyme words to which a large part of M?ller's work is devoted, and the analysis of which represents her most significant contribution to scholarship on the Qur'an. They termed such changes cadl ('modification') or naql ('transfer') from one morphological pattern (wazn or slgha) to another. I prefer cognate substitution as a term for this type of change. The words involved are cognates; as is the case with the 'cognate accusative', termed in Arabic 'the accusative absolute' (al-maf?l al-mutlaq), this is assumed in the Arabic terms rather than stated. In addition, the term cadl suggests a modification, a regular or gradual change from a base form to a not-too-distant final form, as in c?mir &gt; cUmar, whereas in many cases the two look quite different, and one is not produced by a distortion of the other, as in dal?l &gt; tadl?l. Substitution is better, in my view, as it suggests a sudden, abrupt change; al-Zarkash?'s naql ('transfer') is closer to this in meaning, as it implies a more sudden jump from one form to another. Critics including Ab? Hil?l al-cAskari and Diy?3 al-D?n ibn al-Ath?r</page><page sequence="31">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 31 appear to have engaged in a type of self-censorship regarding the phenomenon of cognate substitution. They were unwilling to state boldly that cognate substitutions occurred in the text of the Qur'an and made do with hinting to their audience that this was actually the case. This suggests that the particular topic of cognate substitution tested the limits of accepted literary critical discourse on the text of the Qur'an and that it may have been difficult to express freely. Cognate substitution is an important feature of Qur'anic style, and recognition of this phenomenon may help to resolve exegetical conundrums that have puzzled commentators for centuries. The issue of poetic license, like other exegetical controversies such as the existence of foreign words, grammatical errors, copyists' errors and synonymous terms in the Qur'an, presented something of a theological challenge to medieval exegetes and literary critics, because it suggested that the text could say one thing and actually mean another. This is perhaps most evident in the case of cognate substitutions, where the difference in forms is obvious, as is the difference in the expected meaning to those familiar with the common patterns of Arabic nouns, verbs and adjectives. In some cases, the oddity of the text is even more glaring because the cognate substitute has apparently been created ad hoc and the particular word is not known to exist otherwise. In this case, one might say that God has created a new linguistic form for the sake of rhyme, something that does not actually belong to the Arabic language, and this would be a troublesome contradiction, given the ayas that describe the Qur'an as a clear Arabic text. Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf?, however, addresses this problem in the introduction to Ihk?m al-r?y, by stating that mun?saba ('accordance') is part of the Arabic language and, indeed, a highly coveted effect in Arabic discourse. Even if a new form is produced for a particular rhyme-context, the method of producing such unusual forms is not odd; it is in fact a standard function of the Arabic language. Ihk?m al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y may remain the most substantial pre-modern discussion of the effects of end-rhyme on the ayas of the Qur'an, despite the assiduous investigation of extant manuscripts by modern researchers. It is possible that a complete copy of the original text will turn up in the future, or that al-T?fi's text Bughyat al-w?sil fi macrifat al-w?sil or the text mentioned by Ibn al-Hijja will be found. In the absence of such discoveries, however, it may be possible for scholarship on this topic to advance if the many relevant comments scattered in Qur'anic exegeses, rhetorical manuals and treatises on individual rhetorical figures such as hysteron proteron (taqdlm wa-ta?khlr) are compiled and analysed. In combination with independent investigation of the Qur'an, such efforts may produce important results.</page><page sequence="32">32 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Appendices: Translations Note on Translations I have endeavoured to follow the original texts closely, but because they are so condensed, I have found it necessary to add explanatory text to overcome the difficulties involved in understanding elliptical passages, somewhat after the manner of medieval commentaries. For clarity, I have presented the Arabic of the examples in transliteration as well as translation. The translations of Qur'anic ayas, my own, are somewhat over-literal and intended to clarify the points that Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf? and al-Zarkash? are making. I have on occasion resorted to giving more of the original text of the aya than they do, because they are assuming that the reader will know the rest of the aya from memory. The first text appears in nawc ('category' or 'chapter') 59 of al-Itq?n, which bears the heading 'On the Dividing-words of Ayas' (fi faw?sil al-?y), meaning the verse-final words.81 Ibn al-S??igh's work Ihk?m al-r?yfi ahk?m al-?y is presented in abridgement in the middle of this chapter.82 The second text appears in the third chapter of al-Zarkash?'s Burh?n, on macrifat al-faw?sil wa rn0 ?s al-?y The section on the alteration of morphological forms is presented as the fifteenth of 28 types of deviation from ordinary usage.84</page><page sequence="33">Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 33 Appendix One: Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay Master Shams al-D?n ibn al-S?Digh al-Hanaf? wrote a book which he called Ihkam al-r?y fi ahk?m al-?y ('Exercising Sound Judgement, on the Rules Governing [the Ends of] Qur'anic Ayas') In it he said: Know that accordance (mun?saba) is something sought after in the Arabic language; to achieve it various things are undertaken which violate ordinary usage. He said: I examined the features [deviations from ordinary Arabic usage] that occurred at the ends of ayas in order to provide mun?saba, and I found forty-odd types of change. I. Presentation of the grammatical regimend either before its regent, as in a h??ul??i iyy?kum k?n? yacbud?n (did those You [direct object] used to worship, Q. 34:40) [as opposed to a-h??ul??i k?n? yacbud?nakum ('did those used to worship You?') with the direct object pronoun suffixed to the verb rather than preceding it]. Of the same type is wa-iyy?ka nastac?n (and You we seek out for help, Q. 1:4) [for wa-nastaclnuka ('and we seek help from You'), with the direct object pronoun attached to the verb]. Or [its occurrence] before another regimend which would ordinarily occur first, [as in] li-nuriyaka min ?y?tin? -kubr? (that We might show you of Our signs the greatest, Q. 20:33) if one construes al-kubr? as the direct object of nuriya [i.e. for li-nuriyaka al-kubr? min ?y?tin? ('that We might show you the greatest of Our signs')] or its being placed before the agent of the verb, as in la-qad j?3a ?la fircawna'l-nudhur (there came to the family of Pharaoh the warnings, Q. 54:41) [for la-qad j?0at al-nudhuru ?lafircawn ('the warnings came to the family of Pharaoh')]. Also in this category is the presentation of the predicate of k?na ('was') before its topic, as in wa-lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad (there was not to Him as a peer anyone, Q. 112:4) [for wa-lam yakun ahadun kufuwan lahu ('no one was a peer to Him')]. II. Placement of that which is later in time before that which is earlier, as in, fa-lVll?hVl-?khiratu wa'l-?l? (to God belongs the next [world] and the first [i.e. this world], Q. 53:25). If it were not for the intention of preserving similar verse-final words (mur?c?t al-faw?sil), al-?l? ('the first') would have been placed first, as in lahu'1-hamdufi'l-?l? wa'1-?khira (praise be to Him, in this world and the next, Q. 28:70). III. Placement of the inferior before the superior, as in bi-rabbi H?r?na wa-M?s? (by the lord of Aaron and Moses, Q. 20:70). [Al-Suy?t? adds:] I have presented an explanation of this above.86</page><page sequence="34">34 Journal of Qur'anic Studies IV. Placement of a pronoun before that which indicates its referent, as in fa-awjasa fi nafsihi kh?fatan M?s? (and he sensed in himself a fear, Moses, Q. 20:67) [for fa-awjasa M?s? kh?fatan fi nafsihi ('Moses sensed a fear in himself)]. V. Placement of a modifying relative clause before a modifying adjective, as in wa-nukhriju lahu yawma'l-qiy?mati kit?ban yalq?hu mansh?r? (and We will bring out to him on the Day of Resurrection a scroll that he will receive unfurled, Q. 17:13) [for kit?ban mansh?ran yalq?hu ('... an unfurled scroll that he will receive')]. VI. Apocopation of a final -? in definite defective nouns, as in al-kablru'l mutac?l (the Great and Exalted, Q. 13:9) [for al-mutac?l?] and yawma'l tan?d (on the Day of Calling Back and Forth [for Help], Q. 40:32) [for al-tan?d?]. VII. Apocopation of a final -I in a verb which is not in the jussive mood, as in wa'l-layli idh? yasr(i) (By the night when it departs, Q. 89:4) [for yasrl].81 VIII. Apocopation of the first person singular possessive suffix -?, as mfa-kayfa k?na cadh?bl wa-nudhur (then how were My punishment and My warnings!, Q. 54:16, 18, 21, 30) [for wa-nudhur?] m?fa-kayfa k?na ciq?b (then how was My punishment?, Q. 13:32) [for ?iq?bl]. IX. Lengthening of a final short vowel, as in al-zun?n? ('conjectures', Q. 33:10) [for al-?un?n(a)] and al-sabll? ('the path', Q. 33:67) [for al sab?l(a)]. Included in this category is the retention of a long vowel despite the presence of an apocopating particle, as in l? takh?fu darakan wa-l? takhsh? (do not fear a low station and do not fear, Q. 20:77) [for l? takhaf darakan wa-l? takhsha] and sa-nuqri?uka fa-l? tans? (We will cause you to recite, so do not forget, Q. 87:6) [for fa-l? tansa with a short -a vowel], reading the passages as prohibitions. X. Strong declension of a noun that ordinarily takes the weak declension, as in [wa-yut?fu calayhim bi-?niyatin min fiddatin wa-akw?bin k?nat] qaw?rlr? * qaw?rlr? [min fiddatin qaddar?h? taqdlr?] ([There are circulated among them vessels of silver and goblets that were] crystal glasses * Crystal glasses Q. 76:15-16) for qaw?rlr? * ... qaw?rlr?. XI. Preferring to treat a collective noun as a masculine, as in acj?zu nakhlin munqacir (stumps of uprooted palm trees, Q. 54:20). XII. Preferring to treat a collective noun as feminine, as in acj?zu nakhlin kh?wiya (stumps of hollow palm trees, Q. 69:7). Similar to these two examples are God's word in S?rat al-Qamar, wa-kullu saghlrin wa kablrin mustatir (every small thing and great thing is recorded, Q. 54:53) and in S?rat al-Kahf l? yugh?diru saghlratan wa-l? kablratan ill? ahs?h?</page><page sequence="35">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 35 ([the Book] leaves no small thing or great thing but that it has counted it, Q. 18:49). XIII. Restriction of a word to one of the possible forms it takes in other passages according to the seven variant readings, as in God's word/a ?Wika taharraw rashad? (those have deliberately sought out right conduct, Q. 72:14), where none of the seven readings has rushd?. The same may be said of wa-hayyi3 lan? min amrin? rashad? (... and form for us right conduct regarding our plight, Q. 18:10). This is because the verse-final words in the two suras have vowels on the middle consonant, while [the form rushd] occurs in wa-in yaraw s?bila -rushdi (If they see fit [to follow] the path of right conduct, Q. 7:146). This shows the invalidity of al-F?ris?'s claim that rashad is to be preferred on the grounds of a consensus to that effect.88 Similar to this is the reading of tabbat yad? Abi Lahabin ... (May the hands ofAb? Lahab perish ...!, Q. 111:1) as either Lahabin or Lahbin, while sa-yasl? n?ran dh?ta lahab (He will burn in a flaming fire, Q. 111:3) is read only as lahab, in order to preserve the form of the verse-final word (li-mur?c?t al-f?sila). XIV. Adduction of a sentence as a response to a preceding sentence without having it match its counterpart's composition as a nominal or verbal sentence, as in God's word wa-min al-n?si man yaq?lu ?mann? bVll?hi wa-bVl-yawmVl-?khiri wa-m? hum bi-mw'minin (and among the people are those who say, 'We have accepted belief in God and in the Last Day but they are not believers, Q. 2:8), where their statement ?mann? was not matched in the response thereto, so that He would have said wa-lam yu?min? or m? ?man? ('they did not believe'), for that reason [i.e., in order to maintain end-rhyme with adjacent f?silas]. XV. Violation of parallelism between two (balancing) parts, as in fa la-ya Hamanna 'll?hu 'Uadhlna sadaq? wa-la-ya clamanna -k?dhibln^9 (God indeed knows those who have told the truth, and He indeed knows the liars, Q. 29:3), where God did not say [alladhlna] kadhab? ('those who have lied'). XVI. Presentation of one of two parts of two sentences in a way different from the way it is presented in the other [parallel] sentence, as in UWika'Uadhlna sadaq? wa-?Wika humu'l-muttaq?n (Those are the ones who have told the truth, and those are the God-fearing, Q. 2:177) [as opposed to ?l??ika 'Uadhlna ittaqaw ('those are the ones who have feared God')]. XVn. Preference for the rarer of two [synonymous] terms, as in qismatan dlz? (an unfair division, Q. 53:22), where God did not say j??ira ('tyrannical'),</page><page sequence="36">36 Journal of Qur'anic Studies and la-yunbadhanna fi'l-hutama (he will be thrown into 'the Crusher\ Q. 104:4), where He did not say jahannam ('Gehenna') or al-n?r ('the Fire'). [Similarly, in reference to Hell,] God said in S?rat al-Muddaththir, sa-asllhi saqar (I will cause him to burn in the Scorching, Q. 74:26), in S?rat Sa?ala (al-Mac?rij, Q. 70), innah? laz? (it is Flames, Q. 70:15), and in S?rat al-Q?rica (Q. 101), fa-ummuhu h?wiya (his refuge will be an Abyss, Q. 101:9) to match the verse-final words of those suras. XVIII. The use of two synonymous terms each in a particular [rhyme] context, as in wa'l-yadhdhakkar ?l?'l-alb?b (and let those possessed of intellects take heed, Q. 14:52) [where the end-rhyme is -?b], and in S?rat T?-H?, inna fi dh?lika la-?y?tin U-?Wl-nuh? (in that there are signs for those possessed of intellects, Q. 20:54, 128) [where end-rhyme is -a]. XIX. Ellipsis of an object, as in fa-amm? man act? wa'ttaq? (as for him who gave and feared Q. 92:5) [for man act? sadaqatan wa-ittaq? Allah 'him who gave alms and feared God'], and m? waddacaka rabbuiai wa m? qal? (thy Lord has not forsaken thee, nor has He despised, Q. 93:3) [for wa-m? qal?ka ('nor has He despised you')]. Also included in this category is the ellipsis of the object of the comparative, as in yaclamu'l sirra wa-akhf? (He knows the secret and what is more hidden, Q. 20:7) [for wa-akhf? minhu ('more hidden than that')] and khayrun wa-abq? (better and more lasting, Q. 20:73, 127, 131; Q. 28:60; Q. 87:17) [for khayrun wa-abq? minhu ('better and more lasting than that')]. XX. Use of the singular for the dual, as in fa-l? yukhrijannakum? min al jannati fa-tashq? (so let him not drive you both from the Garden so that thou come to toil, Q. 20:117) [for the dual form fa-tashqay? ('that you two might toil')]. XXI. Use of the singular for the plural, as in wa'jcaln? IVl-muttaqlna im?m? (and make us for the God-fearing an example, Q. 25:74), where He did not say a3imma ('examples') [to match the plural in the first person pronoun in wa'jcaln? ('make us')], as when He said wa-jacaln?hum a?immatan yahd?n (and We made them examples who guide, Q. 21:73). Or inna -muttaq?na fi jann?tin wa-nahar (the God-fearing are in gardens and a stream, Q. 54:54), meaning anh?r ('streams'). XXII. Use of the dual for the singular, as in wa-li-man kh?fa maq?ma rabbihi jannat?n (for him who fears the standing before his Lord are two gardens, Q. 55:46). Al-Farr?3 said: 'He intended janna ('garden'), as in God's word fa-inna'l-jannata hiya,l-ma?w? (the Garden is the refuge, Q. 79:41), but used the dual on account of the verse-final word.' He said: 'Rhyme words allow increases and decreases which other speech does not</page><page sequence="37">Ibn al-Sa3igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-r?y fi ahk?m al-ay 37 allow'. Similar to this is the statement of al-Farr?3 also concerning God's word idh inbacatha ashq?h? (when the most wretched one of the [tribe] was sent forth, Q. 91:12): They were two men, Qadd?r and another along with him, but God did not say ashqay?h? ('the most wretched pair of the [tribe]') on account of the verse-final word'.91 Ibn Qutayba rejected this and denounced it in rough terms, saying: 'At the ends of ayas it is permissible to add a silent h (-ah), omit a glottal stop or letter, but that God would promise two Gardens and that we would make them one Garden because of the verse-final words - God save us (from such a thing)! How could this be when He describes them with adjectives in the dual, as in dhaw?t? afn?n (possessing [dual fern.] all sorts [of pleasant vegetation], Q. 55:48), and then saidfi-him? (in the two of them, Q. 55: 50, 52, 66, 68) [referring to the two gardens]?'92 [XXIII.]93 As for Ibn al-Sa3igh, he94 quoted al-Farr?3 as saying that God intended jann?t but used the dual to refer to the plural, and then commented, 'and this is not unlikely'. He nevertheless said: 'Once this word [jannat?n = 'two gardens'] was established, the pronoun occurred after that in the dual form in order to match that specific word.' This is the twenty-third type.95 XXIV. Using the plural for the singular, as in [... min qabli an ya3tiya yawmun] l? baycafihi wa-l? khil?l (... [before there comes a day] on which there will be neither selling nor friendships, Q. 14:31), meaning wa-l? khulla ('nor friendship'), as in the other aya [Q. 2:254, ... min qabli an ya?tiya yawmun la bay0un fihi wa-l? khullatun wa-l? shaf?ca (... before there comes a day on which there will be no selling, nor friendship, nor intercession)] but it was presented in the plural in order to preserve the verse-final word. XXV. Treating a non-human noun as a human [plural] noun, as in ra?aytuhum ll s?jid?n (I saw them prostrating to me, Q. 12:4) [Joseph's statement concerning the sheaves of wheat in his dream] and kullun fi falakin yasbah?n96 (All are coursing through a firmament, Q. 21:33; Q. 36:40) [in reference to the planets]. XXVI. Use of im?la [pronouncing ? as ae, ? or I] where im?la does not normally occur, as in the ayas of S?rat T?-H? (Q. 20) and S?rat al-Najm (Q. 53).97 XXVII. Use of an emphatic form, such as qadlr ('powerful, able') (passim) or callm ('knowing') (passim), while abandoning this in such phrases as huwal-q?dir (He is the powerful One, Q. 6:65) and c?limu!-ghayb (Knower of the Unseen) (passim). An instance of this is wa-m? k?na</page><page sequence="38">38 Journal of Qur'anic Studies rabbuka nas?ya (thy Lord was not forgetful) (Q. 19:64) [as opposed to the expected form, the active participle n?siy? ('forgetful')]. XXVm. Preference for one emphatic form over another, as in inna h?dh? la shay3 un cuj?b (this is indeed a strange thing, Q. 38:5), which was preferred over cajfb ('strange', Q. 11:72; Q. 50:2) for this reason. XXIX. Separation of two terms connected by a coordinate conjunction, as in wa lawl? kalimatun sabaqat min rabbika la-k?na liz?man wa-ajalun musamm? (were it not for a decree that had already gone forth from your Lord, the judgement would have been inevitable, and for a fixed term, Q. 20:129) [for wa-lawl? kalimatun sabaqat min rabbika wa-ajalun musamman la-k?na liz?man (Were it not for a decree that had already gone forth from your Lord and for a fixed term, the judgement would have been inevitable)]. XXX. Use of a noun where a pronoun would normally occur, as in wa'lladh?na yumsik?na bVl-kit?bi wa-aq?m?'l-sal?ta wa-inn? l? nudlcu ajra -muslih?n (Q. 7:170)98 [for wa-inna l? nudfu ajrahum]. Similar is the aya of [the Sura of] the Cave. [By this he must intend aya 30 of S?rat al-Kahf which reads, inna'lladhlna ?man? wa-camil?'l-s?lih?ti inn? l? nudVu ajra man ahsana camal? (those who have faith and do good works - We do not squander the reward of one who does an excellent work, Q. 18:30), where the phrase man ahsana camal? (one who does an excellent work) appears instead of the pronoun that one would expect, in the phrase inn? l? nudVu ajrahum (we do not squander their reward).] XXXI. Use of a passive participle in place of an active participle, as in God's word hij?ban mast?r? (a covered barrier, Q. 17:45) and k?na wacduhu ma?tfy? (His promise will be arrived at, Q. 19:61), meaning s?tir? ('covering') and ?tiy? ('will arrive'). XXXII. Use of an active participle in place of a passive participle, as in clshatin r?diya (an approving life, Q. 69:21; Q. 101:7) [for mardiyya ('agreeable')] and m??un d?fiq ('pouring water', Q. 86:6) [for madf?q ('poured')]. XXXIII. Separation of a modified noun from its modifier, as in akhraja'l-marc? * fa-jacalahu ghuth??an ahw? ?Who] brings forth pasturage * then turns it to stubble, russet, Q. 87:4-5), if ahw? ('russet') is construed as an accusative of condition modifying [the noun] al-marc? ('pasturage'). XXXIV. Use of one preposition for another, as in bi-anna rabbaka awh?-lah? (that thy Lord inspired for it [the Earth], Q. 99:5), when ordinarily it would be ilayh? ('to it').</page><page sequence="39">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi abkam al-ay 39 XXXV. Placement of a less emphatic adjectival form after a more emphatic form. To this category belongs al-rahm?ni'l-rahlm (the Compassionate and Merciful Q. 1:1, 3; Q. 2:163; Q. 27:30; Q. 41:2; Q. 59:22; etc.) and ra?ufun rahlm (Compassionate and Merciful, Q. 2:143; Q. 9:117, 128; Q. 16:7,47; Q. 22:65; Q. 24:20; Q. 57:9; Q. 59:10), because 'compassion' (ra3fa) is more emphatic than 'mercy' (rahma). XXXVI. Omission of an active form and use of a passive form in its stead, as in wa m? li-ahadin ?indahu min nicmatin tujz? (and no one has a blessing with Him to be awarded, Q. 92:19) [for such constructions as wa-m? yajz? ahadan ('He does not reward anyone') or wa-m? an0ama cal? ahadin ('He does not bless anyone')]. XXXVII. The suffixation of final silent -h, as in m?liyah (my wealth, Q. 69:28), sult?niyah (my power, Q. 69:29), m?-hiyah (what it is, Q. 101:10). XXXVIII. Use of several consecutive prepositional phrases, as in thumma l? tajidu laka bihi calayn? tabV? (Then you will not find for you in it against us a supporter, Q. 17:69), for it is (ordinarily) better to separate them, if it were not for the fact that the preservation of the verse-final word required that this not be done and that tablc? ('a supporter') be placed last. XXXIX. Deviation from the past tense to the future, as mfarlqan kadhdhabtum wa far?qan taqtul?n (One group you denied, and one group you kill, Q. 2:87). It would ordinarily have been qataltum ('you killed'). XL. Changing the form of a word, as in T?ri S?n?n (Mount Sinai, Q. 95:2). The ordinary form is Sina. Ibn al-Sa?igh said: 'This does not preclude other factors, along with that of accordance (mun?sab?), from causing the text in the ayas mentioned to deviate from ordinary usage, for, as is related in the well-known hadlth report, the wonders of the Noble Qur'an are endless.'</page><page sequence="40">40 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Appendix Two: al-Zarkash? on Poetic License Know that creating accordance (mun?saba) in the final syllables of verse-final words, so that they form a matching series (tattarid), is a very strong principle, tremendously effective in creating balance in the sequence of speech and in giving it a pleasant impact on the mind. Therefore, the Qur'anic text deviates from the ordinary arrangement of discourse (nazm al-kal?m) for the sake of accordance in various cases. [I.] The first case occurs when a letter is added for the sake of accordance. For this reason an -? was suffixed to al-zun?na in God's word wa-tazunn?na b?ll?hi'l zun?n? {while you were conjecturing about God conjectures, Q. 33:10), because the final syllables of the verse-final words of this sura [S?rat al-Ahz?b] are -?, converted from an original indefinite ending [accusative -an], as pronounced in pausai form. Here, -? was added to the [final] -n- [in al-^un?n] so that it might match the other final syllables and correspond to the endings of the other verse-final words. Similar to this are fa-adall?n?'l-sabll? (and they led us astray from the path, Q. 33:67) and wa-atacn?'l-ras?l? (and we obeyed the Messenger, Q. 33:66). A certain Maghrib? [scholar] rejected this claim and objected: The alif [-a] was not added for the sake of accordance between the verse-final words (ru3?s al-?y), as a group [of scholars] has said, because S?rat al-Ahz?b includes both wa 'll?hu yaq?lu -haqqa wa-huwa yahdVl-sab?la (God tells the truth, and He guides on the path, Q. 33:4) [where al-s?bila is written with a short final -a] and fa-adall?n?'l-sabll? (they led us astray from the path, Q. 33:67) [where al-sabll? is written with a long final -a]. Each of these two words100 [al-sablla and al-sabll?] is a verse-final word. The -? appears in the second aya and not in the first aya on account of some other factor. If the occurrence of -? had been for the sake of accordance between the verse-ending words, then it would have appeared in both.' He continued, 'The -? was added in passages such as this specifically in order to define two categories, indicating the equality of the apparent sense but the difference of the implicit meaning101 on account of some other factor besides accordance.' Similar is the suffixed quiescent -h in God's word m?-hiyah in S?rat al-Q?rica (Q. 101:10). That -h evened out the final syllables of the verse-final words of this sura, and its suffixation at that point was tremendously effective in enhancing the sura's eloquence. One should interpret as belonging to this category as well - and God knows best - the suffixation of -n- [i.e., the suffix -?n or -In, normally indicating a human, masculine plural] in those passages where it has been suggested that-n has been suffixed, such as God's word wa-kullun fi falakin yasbah?n (they each course in an orbit, Q. 36:40) and God's word k?n? qiradatan kh?si?ln (Be ye despised apes!, Q. 2:65). Among the many modes of eloquence is that</page><page sequence="41">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-r?yfi ahkam al-ay the occurrence of this -n- in the final syllables of these ends of the ayas be of preponderant effect with regard to eloquence, because102 the occurrence of long vowels and dipthongs before their final consonants [i.e., in rhymes such as -?n or -In] had previously been firmly established in those suras in which the addition of final -n occurs. Also God's word wa-T?ri S?n?n (and [By] Mount Sinai, Q. 95:2), which is [ordinarily] T?r Sayn?3, on account of God's word wa-shajaratan takhruju min T?ri Sayn?0 (and a tree that comes out of Mount Sinai, Q. 23:20). Also God's word lacall?arjicu il?'l-n?si lacallahumyaclam?n (may it be that I return to the people, may it be that they know, Q. 12:46) He repeated Walla ('perhaps, may it be that') in order to preserve the parallelism between the final words of the ayas103 since, if the statement had occurred according to ordinary usage, He would have said lacalll arjicu il?'1-n?s fa-yaclam? ('may it be that I return to the people, so that they know'), with the -n suppressed [i.e., in the subjunctive mood as opposed to the indicative] on the grounds that the verb consitutes the apodosis. . The second is the elision or apocopation of hamza or another letter in order to match adjacent ayas, as in God's word wa!-layli idh? yasri (By the night when it departs, Q. 89:4) [as opposed to yasr?, with a final i]. III. The third is the combination of prepositional phrases, and by this one may answer a question regarding God's word thumma l? tajid? lakum calayn? bihi tabV? (then you will not find for you against us in it a supporter, Q. 17:69), for the prepositional phrases come one right after the other, with three prepositions: li- ('for') in lakum (for you), bi- ('in') in bihi (in it), and cal? ('on, against') in calayn? (against us), when it would have been preferable to separate them. The answer is that it is better for tablc? (supporter) to be placed last and for separation to be forgone, than for it to be used to separate some of the dependent prepositional phrases. In addition, the ayas that are contiguous with God's word thumma l? tajid? lakum calayn? bihi tabV? (then you will not find for you against us in it a supporter, Q. 17:69) all have final words in the accusative with the ending -? [the pausai form of -an], so that God's word tablc? ('supporter') had to be placed last, in order for the end of this aya to accord with the ends of the preceding ayas, that they might create a uniform series. IY. The fourth is that what is ordinarily placed first be placed last, such as God's word, fa-awjasa finafsihi khlfatan M?s? (so he sensed in himself a fear, Moses [did], Q. 20:67) because in ordinary speech, the verb is adjacent to its agent and the object is placed last, but He placed the agent, which is Moses, last in order to make the verse-final words match. I say: Placing Moses last has another rationale behind it, and it is that the spirit yearns for the agent of the</page><page sequence="42">Journal of Qur'anic Studies verb aw jasa ('he sensed') and when it comes after being delayed, it has a tremendous effect. Another example is God's word wa-lawl? kalimatun sabaqat min rabbika la-k?na liz?man wa-ajalun musamm? (were it not for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord, then [judgement] would have been inevitable, and for a fixed term, Q. 20:129). For God's word wa ajalun musamm? (and a fixed term) is in adjunction to kalima (a decree), and therefore takes the nominative case. The meaning is, wa-lawl? kalimatun sabaqat min rabbika wa-ajal musamm? la-k?na al-cadh?b liz?man ('were it not for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord') - then the postponed phrase ('and for a fixed term, then [judgement] would have been inevitable'). However, He used hysteron proteron in order that the final words of the ayas might resemble one another.104 Ibn ?Atiyya said this. Al Zamakhshari considered it possible that it be adjoined to the pronoun contained in la-k?na (then it would be) i.e., la-k?na al-ajal al-cajil wa-ajalun musamman l?zimayn lahu ('then the swift retribution and a fixed term would be inevitable for him'), just as they had been irrevocably connected for the tribes of c?d and Tham?d. The fixed term could not be separated from the swift retribution. An example of this is God's word wa-la-qad j??a ?la Fircawna'l-nudhur (there came to the family of Pharaoh the warnings, Q. 54:41). God postponed the agent for the sake of the verse-final word. Another example is God's word wa-mimm? razaqn?hum yunfiq?n (and from what We have provided them they spend, Q. 2:3) - in which He postponed the verb after the object, when He placed it first in what preceded it, in God's word yu?min?na bVl-ghaybi wa yuqim?na'l-sal?t (they believe in the Unseen, and they hold prayer, Q. 2:3) in order that the verse-final words match each other. Ab?'1-Baq?3 [al-cUkbari] said this,105 and it is preferable to al-Zamakhsha?'s opinion, that the object was placed first for specification. An example of this is the postponement of seeking help after worship in God's word iyy?ka nacbudu wa-iyy?ka nastac?n (Thee we worship, and Thee we seek out for help, Q. 1:5), when seeking help ordinarily occurs before worship, but it was placed afterwards in order that the verse-final words of the sura match, according to one of the possible answers. Fifth is use of a singular form for what is ordinarily plural, as in God's word inna -muttaq?na fi jann?tin wa-nahar (the God-fearing are in gardens and a stream, Q. 54:54). Al-Farr?3 said: 'The expected form is al-anh?r ('streams'), but it was treated as a singular because it is the verse-final word, and through being put in the singular it accorded with the final words of the other adjacent ayas.' It is also said that al-nahar is 'light' (al-diy?0) and</page><page sequence="43">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihk?m al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 'expansiveness' (al-sa??), in which case it would no longer be an example of this category.' Another example is God's word wa-m? kuntu muttakhidha'l-mudill?na ?adud? (and I was not about to adopt those who lead astray as a support, Q. 18:51). Ibn S?da stated in al-Muhkam: '[The word cadud? ('arm, support' here)] means [the plural] a?d?dan ('arms, supports'). It was rendered in the singular specifically so that, by this use of the singular, the verse-final words would balance out (wa-innam? ufrida li-tactadila ruD?s al-?y bVl-ifr?d)}06 ?Adud means 'a helper' (mucm).' VI. Sixth is to render in the plural that which is ordinarily singular, as in God's word l? baycunfihi wa-l? khil?l (... on which there will be no buying and no friendships, Q. 14:31), for the intended meaning is wa-l? khulla ('and no friendship'), on the evidence of the other aya [i.e. Q. 2:254, which reads, ... l? bay0un fihi wa-l? khullatun wa-l? shaf??a (... on which there will be no buying, no friendship, and no intercession)], but it was rendered plural in order to accord with the final words of the adjacent ayas. VII. Seventh is to render dual that which is ordinarily singular, as in God's word wa-li-man kh?fa maq?ma rabbini jannat?n (and for him who fears standing before his Lord will be two gardens, Q. 55:46). Al-Farr?3 said: 'This belongs to the category of the Arabs' customary usage in rendering dual or plural the name of a single location, as in [the poet Zuhayr's]107 statement udiy?run lah? bVl-Raqmatayni ..." ('abodes they have in the two Raqma's') and his statement "batn al-Makkatayni" ('the valley of the two Mecca's'), indicating by these terms their surrounding areas, or giving the impression that they have two sides, and that when you are led there, you look to the right and the left and see on both sides of you that which fills your eyes with coolness and your breast with joy.' He continued: 'God made them dual here only for the sake of the verse-final word, taking into account the one before it and the one after it, which are of the same pattern (wazn). Rhymes allow additions and subtractions that other types of speech do not.' Ibn Qutayba criticised him for this quite harshly. He objected: 'It is permissible to add at the ends of ayas a quiescent -h or the vowel -?, or to apocopate hamza (?) or a single letter, but that God would have promised two gardens and we interpret them to be one garden for the sake of the verse-final words - may God preserve us from such a thing! How could this be, when He described this [supposed garden] with dual adjectives, saying dhaw?t? afh?n ('possessing [fem. dual] many types [of pleasant vegetation]') and then He said of the [supposed garden] in the two of them (fihima). If someone were to say about the guards of Hell that they are twenty, but God made them nineteen in order to match the final words of adjacent ayas, that</page><page sequence="44">44 Journal of Qur'anic Studies person's opinion would be exactly equivalent to the opinion of al-Farr?3.' I say: It appears that what caused al-Farr?3 to resort to this opinion was God's word wa-amm? man kh?fa maq?ma rabbihi wa-nah?'l-nafsa cani'l-haw? * fa-inna'l-jannata hiya'l-ma?w? * (but as for him who fears standing before his Lord and restrains his soul from lust, * the Garden will be his resort, Q. 79:40-1). The converse of this is God's word fa-l? yukhrijannakum? min al-jannati fa-tashq? (... so let him not drive you both out of the garden, so that thou come to toil, Q. 20:117) [where two people are addressed, Adam and Eve, but the final verb is in the second person singular]. However, this is susceptible to interpretation, for the definite article al- may be used to indicate generality [i.e., that 'the garden' might mean 'gardens in general'], especially since God's word dhaw?t? afn?n (possessing many types, Q. 54:48) tends to show al-Farr?3 wrong. VIII. The eighth is that what is ordinarily masculine be made feminine, as in God's word kall? innahu tadhkira (Nay! Verily it is an admonishment!, Q. 74:54) [perhaps for kall? innahu dhikr or tadhklr]. It was modified to that form on account of the verse-final word. IX. The ninth is as in God's word sabbih isma rabbika'l-acl? (Praise the name of thy Lord, the Most High, Q. 87:1). He said in [S?rat] al-cAlaq, iqra? bVsmi rabbika'lladhl khalaq (Recite in the name of thy Lord who created, Q. 96:1). He added in the first verse al-acl? and in the second verse khalaq in order to match the verse-final words in the two suras, and these are alladhl khalaqafa saww? (Who created, then formed, Q. 87:2) in [S?rat] Sabbih (Q. 87), and khalaqa'l-ins?na min calaq (created man from a clot, Q. 96:2) in [S?rat] al cAlaq (Q. 96). X. The tenth is to decline according to the strong declension that which is ordinarily declined according to the weak declension, as in God's word [... wa-akw?bin k?nat] qaw?rlr? * qaw?rlr? ... ([... and goblets made of] crystal glasses * crystal glasses ..., Q. 75:15-16). The first instance of qaw?rlr was declined as strong because it is the end of the aya, and the endings of the adjacent ayas108 are -?. It was fitting for it to take the indefinite accusative ending [-an] of the strong declension, which would convert to -? in pausai form, so that it might match the remaining ayas. A similar case is God's word sal?silan wa-aghl?lan ... (chains and fetters, Q. 76:4), for sal?sil (chains), when it was placed in a series with aghl?lan wa-saclr? (fetters and Hell-fire, Q. 76:4), was declined strongly and given the accusative ending -an [as opposed to short -a] in order that they match each other. There remains the second qaw?rlr?, for although it is not the end of an aya, it may follow the strong declension here, because when the first qaw?rlr? was given the ending</page><page sequence="45">Ibn al-SaDigh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi ahkam al-ay 45 in -an, it was fitting that the second qaw?r?r? be given the strong accusative ending -an so that they might match each other. For this reason, only those [readers] who give an ending in nun to the first qaw?r?r? give an ending in nun to the second qaw?r?r?. Imam al-Haramayn [al-Juwayn?] claimed in al-Burh?n that application of the strong declension to plurals in the Qur'an for the sake of matching verse endings also belongs to this category, as in God's word sal?silan wa-aghl?lan {chains and fetters, Q. 76:4). This interpretation is to be rejected because sal?silan is not the verse-final word, nor is the second qaw?r?r?, but rather it was treated as following the strong declension for the sake of matching and because it occurred together with other words that take the strong declension, and it should revert to the common form [i.e., the strong declension] in order to match with them. A similar example with regard to maintaining accordance (mur?c?t al-mun?saba) is that it is more eloquent to say bada?a ('began') as a triliteral verb: God said kam? bada0ahum tac?d?n (as He began you, so ye will return, Q. 7:29) and kayfa bada0 a'l-khalq (how He began Creation, Q. 29:20), but then He said a-wa-lam yaraw kayfa yubdi?u'll?hu'l-khalqa thumma yuc?duhu (did they not see how God begins Creation, then causes it to return?, Q. 29:19), presenting the verb \yubdi?u as opposed to yabda?u] in a quadriliteral pattern [afal, measure IV]. This was nevertheless eloquent because of the excellent accordance He created with the other part of the phrase, His word, yuc?duhu (causes it to return). Eleventh is the im?la of that which is ordinarily not subject to im?la, like the im?la of the final -? [in al-duh? and saj? in the ayas] wa'l-duh? * wa'l-layli idh? saj? (Q. 93:1-2), so that the pronunciation of these two verse-final words might resemble the pronunciation of the final words of the following ayas. Im?la is that you make the pronunciation of -? tend toward -F. Its original purpose is to create accordance, and some have expressed this with the maxim 'al-im?la IVl-im?la" Rimala is for inclination'). A vowel might be pronounced with im?la because it occurs at the end of a word that is parallel to another [rhyme-]word, the end of which has been pronounced with im?la, like the -? of tal? in God's word wa'l-qamari idh? tal?h? (By the moon when it follows [the Sun], Q. 91:2), where the -? of tal?h? was pronounced with im?la in order that its pronunciation might match the pronunciation of what comes after it, among those words whose -? derive from109 an original -y-, such as jall?h? (Q. 91:3) and yaghsh?h? (Q. 91:4).110 If one objects, 'Couldn't the im?la of tal?h? have occured in order to match what came before it, i.e., duh?h?T, one should respond, '[This is not possible] because the -? of [duh? in] duh?h? derives from an original -w-, and was only pronounced with im?la because of what comes after it'.</page><page sequence="46">46 Journal of Qur'anic Studies XII. Twelfth is deviation from past verb forms to future verb forms, as in God's word fa-farlqan kadhdhabtum wa-farlqan taqtul?n (one group you denied, and one group you will kill, Q. 2:87), where He did not say wa-farlqan qataltum (and one group you killed). He also made them equal in Sur at al-Ahz?b, where He said, farlqan taqtul?na wa-ta? sir?na farlqan (you kill one group and you take one group captive, Q. 33:26). This is because it is the end of an aya here.</page><page sequence="47">Ibn al-Sa?igh al-Hanaf?'s Ihkam al-ray fi abkam al-ay 47 Appendix Three: al-Zarkash? on the Semantic Implications of Changes in Form111 Know that when a word is of a certain morphological pattern, then is transferred to another, higher pattern, it must then contain more meaning than it did in the first place, because words are signifiers, and when [the forms of] words are augmented, their meanings must necessarily be augmented. An example of this is God's word fa akhadhn?hum akhdha cazlzin muqtadir (therefore we grasped them with the grasp of One Mighty and Powerful, Q- 54:42), for muqtadir is more emphatic than q?dir ('able, powerful'), because it signifies that He is powerful and firmly established in His power, and that nothing can prevent His power from being carried out. This is a rhetorical figure called 'strength of the word for strength of the meaning'. [Another example is] God's word wa'stabir (and have patience, Q. 2:175; Q. 19:65; Q. 20:132; Q. 54:27), for it is a more emphatic way of commanding patience than fa'sbir ('so be patient'). And God's word lah? m? kasabat wa-calayh? m?ktasabat (for [the soul] is that which it has earned, and against it is that which it has committed, Q. 2:286), for since the evil deed in question was weighty and involved great strain, the verb describing its commission was augmented. And God's word wa-hum yastarikh?na fih? (and they cry for help therein, Q. 35:37), for it is more emphatic than yatas?rakh?na ('they cry back and forth'). And God's word fa-kubkib? fih? (so they will be hurled therein, Q. 26:94), where He did not say wa-kubb? ('and they were thrown'). Al-Zamakhshan said: 'The verbal noun kabkaba is the repetition of kabb ('throwing'); the repetition in the form of the word is an indication of semantic repetition, as if someone, when he is thrown into Hell, tumbles time after time until he comes to rest at its very bottom - May God, the best one from whom we may seek protection, protect us from it!' Similar to this is the opinion of al-Khal?l112 with regard to the Arabs' saying 'sarra al-jundub' ('the cricket chirped') but 'sarsara al-b?zf ('the falcon screeched'), as if they imagined that there was a lengthening in the sound of the cricket and so said 'it chirped with a chirruping' (sarra sar?ran) and imagined that there was an intermittent series in the sound of the falcon, and so said 'it screeched' (sarsara). There are also examples of augmentation through gemination, for satt?r ('given to protecting') and ghaff?r ('given to forgiving') are more emphatic than s?tir ('protecting') and gh?fir ('forgiving'). For this reason God said fa-qultu'staghfir? rabbakum - innahu k?na ghaff?r? (I said: 'Ask your Lord for forgiveness - He is indeed Forgiving!', Q. 71:10). On this account, some scholars have considered al rahm?n stronger in meaning than al-rahlm ('the Merciful') because its form is augmented by the suffix -?n, and this has been discussed above in the tenth category.113 Similar to this are geminate verbs - or some say verbs indicating</page><page sequence="48">48 Journal of Qur'anic Studies repetition (takth?r) - the use of a form that denotes occurrence of the action of the verb time after time. The verbs in question must be transitive before gemination, and not rendered transitive by the gemination itself. This is why al-Zamakhshari was criticised for his interpretation of God's word wa-?in kuntum fi raybin mimm? nazzaln? cal? cabdin? (if you are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed to our servant, Q. 2:23), since he considered nazzaln? (revealed, literally 'sent down') to take the geminate form here to indicate repeated action.114 Gemination occurs only rarely with intransitive verbs to indicate repeated action, as in mawwata al-m?l ('the money continually, or repeatedly, ran out'). It also occurs in cases where it cannot possibly denote repeated action, as in God's word lawl? nuzzila calayhi ?yatun min rabbihi (if only a sign were revealed to him from his Lord, Q. 6:3V)115 and la-nazzaln? calayhim min al-sam?^i maiakon ras?l? (then We would have sent down upon them from the sky an angel as messenger, Q. 17:95). You might object that [God's word] fa-umatticuhu qalllan (then I will cause him to enjoy a little, Q. 2:126) is problematic according to this rule, because if the verb pattern faccala indicates repeated action, then how can 'a little' be used to modify the [ellipsed] cognate accusative from matta0a, for this would be describing many actions as few, which is a logical impossibility. I would respond that He described it as 'a little' on account of its inevitable running out, decreasing, and coming to an end. Know that the augmentation of meaning in this category applies only to transfer to a quadriliteral form that has not been coined for a particular meaning, for in such a case the form does not denote the same thing that is denoted when a triliteral pattern is transferred to a pattern such as this, for God's word wa-kallama'll?hu M?s? takllm? (and God spoke directly to Moses, Q. 4:164) does not indicate the repeated utterance of speech by God, because the verb kallama has not been transferred from a triliteral form [i.e. kalama, which has the unrelated meaning 'to wound']. One may make the same argument regarding God's word wa-rattilVl-Qur3?na tartll? (and chant the Qur'an in measure, Q. 73:4), which indicates abundant reading in a deliberate and contemplative manner, and likewise, regarding God's word wa-m? callamn?hu'l-shicr (and We have not taught him poetry, Q. 36:69), where the negation is not of an emphatic form, but of the original verb.

The other five planets are not named, but the Qur'an refers to seven heavens (Q. 2:29; Q. 17:44; Q. 23:86; Q. 41:12; Q. 65:12; Q. 67:3; Q. 71:5; Q. 78:12), equivalent to the seven spheres, each containing the orbit of one of the seven planets. Several ayas state that the heavens are arranged in layers (tib?q), one above the other (Q. 67:3; Q. 71:15) and one aya refers to seven paths, evidently the courses of the seven planets: la-qad khalaqn? fawqakum sabca tara?iqa ...

Al-Suy?t? also quotes al-B?qill?m's discussion of this aya from Tj?z al-Qur??n at al-Itq?n, vol. 2, pp. 211-12. 87 In my opinion, the rhyme in this case was probably intended to be yaser, with a short vowel between the final and penultimate consonants, rather than yasr or yasri, with a final short vowel, both of which are unlikely in comparison with other rhymes in the Qur'an.

The break between the two is difficult to discern, and the editors of al-Itq?n have apparently not understood that flhim? is a quotation of the Qur'an and belongs to Ibn Qutayba's statement, for it is followed by a colon, as if to introduce a following statement: thumma q?la flhim?: ...

As the final -? in duh? has an underlying -w-, it would not ordinarily be pronunced with im?la, but in this case is subject to im?la in order to match the final vowels of the surrounding ayas. On im?la in the Qur'an see chapter 30 of al-Suy?t?, al-Itq?n (vol. 1, pp. 198-203); N?ldeke, Schwally, Pretzl and Bergstr?sser, Geschichte des Korans, vol. 3, pp. 36 41.

(Q. 91:3) is more likely what al-Zarkash? intended, for it is a verse-final word while ghashsh?h? is not, and he is speaking about the ayas that follow Q. 91:1-2. 111 Al-Zarkash?, al-Burh?n, vol. 3, pp. 34-6. 112 Al-Khal?l ibn Ahmad (d. ca 175/791-2), the famous grammarian and lexicographer. 113 The text states the 'sixth' category, but this example occurs in the tenth category.

The point is that measure I nazala ('to descend') is intransitive, so that the transitive 'to send down' must be indicated by nazzala (or, alternatively, anzola), whereas with a verb such as qatac ('to cut'), the transitive verb can already be expressed by form I, and the geminate form II qattaca ('to cut up, cut into pieces') must indicate not merely a transitive action but also a repeated action. 115 The published text cites instead of this aya the similar aya Q. 13:7, lawl? unzila calayhi ?yatun min rabbini (If only a sign were revealed to him from his Lord). However, because it uses the form unzila instead of the geminate verb nuzzila, al-Zarkash?'s point would be lost. He must have intended Q. 6:37 rather than Q. 13:7.
