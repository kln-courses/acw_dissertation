London: Curzon Press, 1992. ~14.99 In a speech the day before the 1992 meeting of the International Whaling Commission a British MP addressing an audience of anti-whalers said: 'If indeed these people want something exotic to eat they should try eating each other, rather than eating the whales'. The authors of this book do not agree with such opinions, nor do they agree that killing of whales is essentially 'criminal activity'. The book starts with a discussion on the rhetoric of the whaling controversy and asks the question how whales and dolphins have become such high-profile animals in the environmental discourse. They also set about to puncture some of the myths about cetaceans as uniquely special in the animal kingdom. These myths, consisting of ideas about superior intelligence and various anthropomorphic abilities, have been used by whale conservationists to legitimize a position which excludes the use of whale stocks that otherwise seem to tolerate controlled exploita- tion on a sustainable basis. As a social anthropological account of Japanese whaling culture the book sketches the involve- ment of six Japanese whaling communities in</page><page sequence="2">624 BOOK REVIEWS whaling operations and continues with accounts of individual whalers and their families whose way of life is under threat. The authors then outline the history ofJapanese whaling, describ- ing the pre-modem passive whaling of drifting and stranded animals and active whaling involv- ing the use of nets. Modem forms have been pelagic whaling, large type coastal whaling and small type coastal whaling. The authors explain the work organization of modem Japanese whaling and the recruitment of whalers, most of which were recruited to these highly prestigious jobs from within a circle of personal connexions in whaling communities. A chapter on local whaling culture describes the adaptation of local communities to whaling and the importance of whale meat in social exchange and as symbolic food in the construction of community identity. Whaling has also been the focus of elaborate rit- uals interwoven with Shinto and Buddhism, aimed at acknowledging the souls of dead whales. The authors report the human suffering connected to job losses in the wake of the whal- ing moratorium and the endangered culture of whaling. Whalers have problems in ajob market where their expertise is of little value and in a society where unemployment among men is so- cially unacceptable. The book is polemical in style and detailed descriptions of how whales are hunted, killed, cut up, salted, dried, cooked and generally trans- formed from nature to culture will not appeal to those whose image of and ideas about whales precludes their treatment as natural resources. By putting Japanese whaling into cultural context the authors succeed in putting a human face to something which is otherwise considered by Politically Correct attitudes in Western cul- ture to be a vile and disgraceful industry. The saying of the MP about the beastly busi- ness of whalers is one example of how emotion- ally laden the whaling issue is and how far people are willing to go in condemning prac- tices in 'exotic' cultures. There is a need for cul- tural tolerance from both sides of the controversy. Even though Kalland and Moeran make no attempt to hide their sympathy with the Japanese position, the book is nevertheless an important contribution to such an under- standing.
