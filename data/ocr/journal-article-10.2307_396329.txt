The huge Picasso and Things show, which opened at the Cleveland Museum of Art and went on to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Grand Palais in Paris, offered a rare diachronic view of Picasso's lifelong preoccupation with still life. The painter's relentless researches into all the forms the human figure could take- including some biomorphic and psychological forms the figure had never before taken in Western art-have been extensively studied. The Cleveland Museum's imaginatively conceived two-floor display of Picasso-the-industry and Picasso-the- icon revealed something new about modern art's most extensively studied painter, that objects were the handwriting of Picasso's never-written concrete and theoret- ical notebooks. Unblurred by the critical sentimentalization, symbolization, and "biograph-ization" provoked by his portraits and images of war and conflict, these assembled representations of things also confirmed the fact that Picasso was a wildly irreverent painter and that his exuberant, Dionysian, and humorous inven- tiveness made of all the images he represented-including those of people-sym- bols, toys, tools, concrete poems for a restless imagination. Curator Jean Sutherland Boggs's intelligent opening essay inserts the painter's extensive practice of still-life painting into an artistic tradition framed by Zur- bar'n, Chardin, C&amp;zanne, and the Douanier Rousseau; she evokes Picasso's strange habit of living surrounded by the palimpsests of "the chance accumulation of ... many unrelated objects" (12) and suggests that this fatalistic acceptance of clutter was counterbalanced by a ruthless selectivity and search for order when things found their way into the painter's works. This rather simplistic version of art as reactive psychology detracts very little from Boggs's patient analysis of the incredible range of Picasso's representations of objects, which in his hands became vessels, parables, personifications, jokes, mysteries, souvenirs-the icons on the map of a very long, incredibly productive career. All the faces assumed by Picasso's things are handsomely illustrated and perspic- uously commented on in this giant, impressively documented catalogue: the votive objects and sentimental props of the early work; the great experimental "leaps" of analytical cubism; the props of the cubist portraits; the resounding "thingism" of synthetic cubism; the spectacular works of collage; the cubist sculpture and con- structed objects; the protosurrealist and symbolizing things of the thirties (one of the painter's rare weak periods); the thing-figure phase of the anthropomorphic forties and fifties; and, finally, the great leap forward into the "grand design" objects-the anchors, flowers, the skulls of the memento mori thematics-and the bold, beautiful pottery. A catalogue well worth reading and viewing for a thoughtful, wide-ranging view of modern art and culture's most protean and prolific Spanish-French- international artist's odyssey through the painting genre that has only recently, with studies such as Norman Bryson's Looking at the Overlooked: Four Essays on Still</page><page sequence="2">832 FRENCH REVIEW Life Painting and Boggs's texts in this volume, begun to receive the attention it deserves.
