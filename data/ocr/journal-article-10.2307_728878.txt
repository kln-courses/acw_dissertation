<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS I"5 carefully the differences'in the settings, for it would never do to give A's flavouring to B's setting. The second difficulty is language. Some languages unknown to most English-speaking people have begun to appear in song-programmes. Here the accom- panist must fall back on his friends; for it is a remarkable fact how easy it is in London to find someone acquainted with the remotest of European dialects. However, as Gerald Moore has accompanied a Chinese singer in Chinese, there can hardly be any linguistic worlds left for him to conquer. Familiarity with the words is specially needed in strophic songs (in any language) when each strophe has its own character. Gerald Moore's sensible advice about practising, and especially about listening for tone, is valid for soloists as well as for accompanists. Indeed, much of the book could be summed up in the words, "There are no easy accompaniments. Be fresh, then, even with a song you have played a hundred times; for there will always be somebody to whom it is a revelation ". These pages appear to deal with everything that goes to the making of a good accompanist. They should stimulate the large tribe of aspiring pianists into reaching for a book of songs and trying how far they can be called unashamed accompanists-worthy partners in an artistic association which, as Gerald Moore's concluding page truly says, requires good technique, good ear, good sensitivity and, above all, a good heart. And suppose you begin, not with the pianistic splendours of 'Erlkonig' or ' Von ewiger Liebe', but with the tremendous understatement of 'Der Leiermann' or ' Der Doppelganger'. G. S. Musical Interludes in Boston: I796-r830. By H. Earle Johnson. (' Columbia University Studies in Musicology.') pp. 366. (Columbia University Press, New York; Milford, London, 1943.) 26s. 6d. The period under consideration is just previous to that of the Concord Group, ending three years before Emerson's visit to England, at the time when HenryJames senior was a boy. Music in Boston was peginning to be treated with that seriousness which it has always been Boston's pride to expend on learning. The chief source of supply was Europe, whence came Gottlieb Graupner, who probably played the new Haydn sym- phonies under Haydn and Salomon in London; and the extraordinary figure, a " very incarnation of obesity ", Dr. George K. Jackson, pupil with Arnold and Dupuis of Nares, who reached Boston in I812, having left London "from whose precincts he fled for reasons which . . . remain undisclosed " with wife and family (eleven). These men were the pioneers, and the author's description of them is full of interest. Between them, Jackson with his memories of the I784 Handel Commemoration in which he sang, his friendship with Arnold whose Handel edition he possessed, his evident reverence for Handel's music, and Graupner whose predilections were in the direction of Haydn and the classical symphony and who was above all a performer and something of an impressario, these two set things going in Bostonr. The one represented insular Englishry, the other continental breadth of interest. With the slightly earlier arrivals, the family of von Hagen (Burney knew their ancestry), Graupner with his actress wife, and the great Dr. Jackson, Boston found herself in the possession of the Philharmonic Society for instrumental music (known to be in existence in 1809) and the Handel and Haydn Society for choral music, which was founded in 1815 and may have been the body responsible for the commission sent to Beethoven for a new work. There is a great deal of curious information to be gleaned from this book, which is fully documented and written in a manner that engages the reader's interest to a degree which ends by surprising as much as it delights. It provides a valuable footnote to the history of music in America. It is a tribute to the author's scholarship that he should have marshalled with such precision the details he has rescued from odd corners of Boston's musical history. Not the least among these rescued items is the hymn Ye monsters of the bubbling deep, Your Maker's praises shout; Up from the sands, ye codlings, peep, And wag your tails about. To have discovered that authentic echo of Boston's early religious directness of utterance must have been worth a year of dusty search. S. G. Proceedings of the Musical Association. Sixty-Ninth Session, I942-43. pp. 104. (Whitehead &amp; Miller, Leeds, 1943.) 2 Is. The present volume contains, besides the usual matter of Proceedings, four articles of unusual interest to the musical reader, two rather special and two more general. The two special articles are, first, ' The Double-Bassoon: its Origin and Evolution' by Lyndesay G. Langwill and, second, ' The Evolution of the Modern French Horn' by R. Morley-Pegge. Each is elaborately documented and beautifully illustrated. I call these " special " articles, because I suppose such close pieces of research in musical</page><page sequence="2">n6 MUSIC AND LETTERS engineering will have no wide general appeal. Nevertheless they ought to exist and ought to be known to exist, and we should be grateful to the authors for their immense labour in compiling them and to the Musical Association for its enterprise in publishing them. Most of us, who take the modern orchestra for granted, need to be reminded that the instruments which compose it have each its own history. We need go no farther back than the ever-popular Brandenburg Concertos to discover that the familiar violin was not always top-dog in the orchestra. The famous makers of violins have their legends (see George Eliot's ' Stradivarius '); but no one is likely to sing of the heroes who elaborated the French horn or who fashioned a massive and cumbrous piece of machinery into the double-bassoon which was to serve Beethoven in the ninth Symphony and elsewhere. Carent quia vate sacro we gratefully accept Mr. Langwill and Captain Morley-Pegge as their faithful historians. The two papers I have called general are, first, ' A Survey of Music in New Zealand: its Weakness and its Opportunities' by Violet Rucroft, and, second, ' Santley and some Famous Singers of his Time,' byJ. Mewburn Levien. The first of'these is rather startling to English readers, few of whom ever suppose that New Zealand, that compendium of natural beauty, is a land without music-or almost. The Maories are a musical race, but little was done to record their music in its early purity, and by now, one gathers, it is partly Americanized. The British settlers had no time or place or opportunity for making music. Here in England, where we have been singing together in one way or another for centuries, every town of any size has its choral society, and every village its church and choir. But where are the villages of New Zealand ? What place is there for the English carol when Christmas falls in the full tide of summer ? What place is there for songs of the lovely renewal of spring in a more deeply hued and evergreen country ? What is really grievous to find is the small place taken by singing in schools. New Zealand, it appears, is prolific in politicians. Has no one discovered that the birthright of all children is the joy of singing and the joy of drawing ? Miss Rucroft has certain recommendations to offer; but surely the first step is to ensure that children should grow up to music. Song, percussion bands and pipes or recorders, used in English villages and English town slums, are possible in any New Zealand school. If the educational authorities are unsympathetic, then the teachers must unite in educating the authorities. But New Zealand mVst provide its own native songs and music. It cannot and must not import from abroad what should spring from its own heart. Further, while not neglecting music as a professional occupation, it must stimulate the songs of the people, from which music naturally grows. One enormous difficulty in New Zealand is the geographical difficulty of getting together. But teachers can form musical associations, in spite of geographical difficulties, and combine to get a good musical foundation laid in the schools. We in England can advise and encourage, but what can we actually do ? Nothing but sympathize, as Michael Finsbury said on a memorable occasion. To pass from Miss Rucroft to the evergreen Mewburn Levien is to pass from a forest of silence to a grove of singing birds. All the songsters of a century seem to gather round the greatest of English singers, Charles Santley, and the centenarian teacher, Manuel Garcia, and Mr. Levien knows them all, and their sisters and their cousins and t. eir aunts. Nothing could be easier than to make such an account merely a tiresome catalogue; but Mr. Levien marshals and arrays his immense concourse of singers, equips each with appropriate history and anecdote, and sets them moving before us with no trace of confusion: So convincing is his showmanship that he makes us feel certain that we heard everyone of them otrselves. Such a masterly essay is not only an invaluable summary of history, it is a stimulus to the practice and appreciation of great singing. G. S. Bird Music: an Introduction to the Study of the Vocal Expressions of British Birds, with appreciations of their Songs. By A. L. Turnbull. pp. 125, pl. 12. (Faber &amp; Faber, London, 1943.) 7s. 6d. The anthropomorphic approach to the study, or at least the description, of animals dies hard. Even to-day it crops up, taking from books such as the ~present one, with its excellent photographs and its evident desire to impart knowledge and enthusiasm, nearly all scientific value. What remain are some useful hints showing that the author is a good field naturalist and a less sound musician (to be which, incidentally, he lays no claim). He is right in suggesting that transliteration of bird songs is difficult, though surely wrong in saying it is futile. It should not be beyond human ingenuity to invent a script for precise notation. Already there are Koch's gramophone records for purposes of checking. And however imprecise the method may be at present, it is truer than to anthropomorphize the poor birds' utterances, speaking of " a tribute of song homage to his Maker" (lark), "its laughter is of a sardonic nature " (black-headed gull) or "mother says a kind word or two in bird-nursery language." And it seems particulbrly hard luck on the nightingale to call its long crescendo call a " Melba note ". One of the author's descriptive paragraphs, that on the wren, is admirable. " The pace . . . is so whirling that the wren seems almost intoxicated with its own speed .... ". That is not only good writing but apt description which helps to identify the song.
