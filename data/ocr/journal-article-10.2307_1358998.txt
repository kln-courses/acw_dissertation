<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frida Kahlo by Salomon Grimberg Barnes and Noble Books, 1997 Lindee Climo by Salomon Grimberg National Museum of Women in the Arts, 1996 Although a practicing child psychiatrist in Dallas, Mexican-born Grimberg has been a tireless supporter of women artists, especially those working in Mexico. A Kahlo expert who has published on and continues to do research on the artist, he has also curated exhibits and written catalogue essays for other artists he fa- vors, among them Lindee Climo, born in 1948 near Boston and educated in Arizona and Cal- ifornia, where her family had moved. Climo, who now lives on a farm in Halifax with her extended family of animals, paints in a photo- realist style animals, mostly sheep, in poses reminiscent of Old Master paintings, for ex- ample, Pastoral (1994), after Titian's Le Con- cert Champitre, and Flora (1993), after Rem- brandt's painting of the same title. "The tradi- tion of establishing anthropomorphic qualities in animals has been documented since classi- cal times as a means to decipher human char- acter," explains Grimberg. Climo seeks humor in her work and avoids sentimentality. "I've never met a sheep that was sweet and gentle," she says. The Kahlo book is from a popular art se- ries, with a short text and almost 100 color plates. However, casual readers soon will learn that they have serendipitously pur- chased a book by an expert.</page></plain_text>
