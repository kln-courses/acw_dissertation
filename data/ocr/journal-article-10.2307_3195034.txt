<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literal and Metaphoric Harmony with Nature: Ecofeminism and Harriet Prescott Spofford's "Circumstance" Ian Marshall Harriet Prescott Spofford's short story "Circumstance," published in 1860, is not yet widely known, but it deserves to be and may well be soon. It is included in the recent Heath Anthology of American Literature, in Judith Fetterley's anthology of nineteenth-century American women's fiction entitled Provisions, and in a collection of Spofford's stories recently released as part of the American Women Writers Series put out by Rutgers University Press. Based on an incident involving Spofford's maternal great-grandmother, the story relates the encounter of an un- named woman with a large panther. On her return home after visiting a sick neighbor, she gets caught in the woods by darkness-and by the panther, known locally as the Indian Devil, which seizes her and carries her into a tree. Her screams rile the panther, but when she sings a lullabye to soothe her soul, her singing also soothes the beast. She sings through the night, until her husband arrives at dawn to kill the panther with a single rifle shot. When the couple and their child return to civilization, they find that their home has been burnt by Indians, and so, concludes the narrator, "Desolation and death were indeed there [in the village], and beneficence and life in the forest" (278). Critical commentary on the story thus far, most notably by Fetterley, Alfred Bendixen, and Anne Dalke, has focused on feminist aspects of the tale. Fetterley points out that the story illustrates gender roles as they were defined in nineteenth-century America; the story suggests that the lower nature of men, represented by the panther and its symbolic rape of the woman, can be redeemed by women's more developed spiritual nature (266). All three critics see the story as an allegory of the woman artist's plight-she must "sing" in order to survive. As Dalke points out, "her singing is a metaphor for all writing, all reading, all renditions of the written word," and "only sustained invention can save her from annihilation" (77). Fetterley notes, though, that "the circum- stances of her performance are hardly self-determined or free. . ... Her choice of song grows out of a frantic effort to determine what will please and placate the beast" (264)-just as women writers of the time had to produce subject matter that conformed with the expectations of the male- dominated publishing world or, as Bendixen puts it, "the beast of the American reading public" (xxvi-xxvii). These readings of "Circumstance" help place it in the tradition of women's writing, especially from the nineteenth century, that explores the often covert attempts of women to develop and express their artistic potential. Together, Fetterley, Dalke, and Bendixen make a strong case for the story's merit as a tantalizing allegory of the woman writer's role in nineteenth-century America. Thus far, however, the critics have offered little comment on the role of nature in the story. Bendixen treats 48</page><page sequence="2">the subject only briefly, reading the story as a female version of the typically male encounter-with-the-wilderness adventure tale: "Circumstance" can best be understood as a female counterpart to the more familiar stories of male initiation in which the protagonist journeys into a psychic wilderness, confronts his own fears through a series of symbolic adventures involving entrapment and escape, eventually comes to terms with his own sexual nature, accepts the reality of death, and finally emerges able to acknowledge his limitations and make full use of his potential in the face of a difficult and often hostile universe. (xxvii) According to Bendixen's reading, the woman triumphs over "the savagery of animal passion, the inevitability of death, and the indifference of nature" (xxvii). But one can also read the story as a celebration of women's relationship with nature; in the story the protagonist's initial sentimental view of nature and her interim conception of nature's indifference or hostility is rejected in favor of an incipiently ecological perspective. Thus the story serves as a classic text for the application of ecofeminist principles. Ecofeminism explores the connections between the oppression of women and the despoliation of the natural environment; essentially, the connection is that both arise from man-centered thinking. When "man" is considered the essence of humanity, as is usually the case in a patriarchal culture, then anthropocentrism and androcentrism are almost the same thing. In terms of the binary oppositions that seem to result from the hierarchical thinking of a patriarchal culture, man and civilization are privileged concepts, woman and nature unprivileged, defined as "other." Ecofeminists further suggest that the solution to the problems of sexism and environmental abuse must also share common ground: both require a decentering in our world views, a shift to a way of thinking that goes beyond binary oppositions and hierarchies of privilege and power.1 Thus far, ecofeminist work has been primarily, and necessarily, theoretical, mostly directed at the task of definition. But now that its premises have been established, literary practitioners of ecofeminism ought to begin the work of applying the principles of ecofeminism to literature. In a recent article Patrick Murphy promises that ecofeminism "will not only make its existence felt in literary studies in the 1990s but has the potential to alter such studies irrevocably" ("Ground," 146). To do so, contends Murphy, "literary theory and criticism need to integrate ecofeminist philosophy into its most basic practices" (159). Implicit in his argument is Murphy's sense that the integration of ecofeminism into literary studies has not yet begun. Murphy himself begins the process by first pointing out the links between ecofeminist thought and Mikhail Bakhtin's ideas of dialogism, which have proven so valuable in literary study in recent years, and by then exploring the ecofeminist bases of contemporary works of fiction by Margaret Atwood, Kate Wilhelm, and Ursula K. LeGuin. While these contemporary writers consciously incorporate ecological and feminist ideas in their work, ecofeminists generally assert 49</page><page sequence="3">that the association between women and nature existed even before the rise of the environmental or modem feminist movements. Spofford's short story can not be said to apply ecofeminist principles, since those principles did not exist yet. Further, as a product of her age, Spofford falls short of fulfilling our idea of feminist and ecological ideals; her vision of women's empowerment is somewhat negated by her protagonist's eventual reliance on the strong arm and straight aim of her husband, and her vision of ecological balance is disrupted by the act of violence, the shooting, which is presented as the heroic, authorially-approved means of the protagonist's rescue. But if we are willing to play resisting reader from an ecofeminist perspective, we can see in "Circumstance" a neat illustration of the ways in which even "protoecological" works (Murphy's term) can demonstrate ecofeminist principles and be illuminated by them. Before the panther attack, the woman enjoys an innocent sort of communion with nature. Walking in the woods she senses "companion- ship" and "the sweet homefeeling of a young and tender wintry wood" (84). If the wood is a friend and a home of sorts for her, it is also a source of sustenance and sensory pleasure; as she walks, she chews on "a bit of spicy birch" (85). Her attitude is environmentally sensitive and knowledgeable; she appreciates natural beauty, and she knows how to make use of it to enhance the pleasures of her life. Other evidence of the woman's sympathy with nature is expressed in a sentimental manner that partakes of the pathetic fallacy, ascribing human traits and feelings to nature. When the woman sees the sunset of "failing orange," for instance, she imagines that it "slowly slipped down the earth's broad side to sadden other hemispheres with sweet regret" (85). Ecologists generally object to such anthropomorphic views of nature, since they suggest an inability to see nature in any other than human terms. The term "pathetic fallacy" suggests that literary critics also disapprove of this sort of anthropomorphizing. But Neil Evernden in "Beyond Ecology: Self, Place, &amp; the Pathetic Fallacy" argues that the pathetic fallacy is profoundly ecological because it expresses the inter- relatedness, the sense that the human self and the natural world are one, that constitutes a basic premise of ecology. If the pathetic fallacy is not good ecological science, it does bespeak the intuited sense of connection to nature that writers in the sentimental tradition felt even before science provided a rationale for those feelings. The most striking evidence of the woman's spiritual attunement to nature, of course, is her taming of the panther through song. Quite literally, the story represents her "harmony" with nature. But the nature of that harmony goes beyond the simple communion that she feels at first as she walks along the woods. The change in her perception of the wild is measured by the progression of songs she sings in order to maintain her peaceful coexistence with the panther. She starts off singing a lullabye, and as she sings she pictures her baby, with "fringed-gentian eyes," and her home, where herbs hang from the ceiling and "the log walls [are] painted with lichens and festooned with apples" (87). In this vision she persists in perceiving nature as beneficent, sweet like her baby, 50</page><page sequence="4">useful like the herbs, fruits, and plants that adorn her home. Her view of nature's innocence reflects her relationship with nature as the story begins, but that view is tested by her ordeal in the woods. After the lullabye, the woman sings "a wild sea-song, such as some sailor might be singing far out on trackless blue water that night, the shrouds whistling with frost and the sheets glued in ice,-a song with the wind in its burden and the spray in its chorus" (87). Then she sings a rollicking reel, a hornpipe, and a jig. If the lullabye is associated with infancy and the calm comfort of home, these songs evoke youth in all its recklessness and high spiritedness, when we go to nature to seek adventure and we delight in meeting the challenges of the natural world. In terms of human relations to nature, the next step in our development-as individuals and as a species-is to think that we must conquer nature. And so the woman's next attempts to placate the panther take the form of "vivid national airs ... slogan and keen clan cries ... wild wartunes" (88). If these tunes suggest a need to tame the wild through the strength of numbers, the implication is that nature is regarded with fear and loathing. When the narrator thinks of her home now, she thinks of it not as a place bedecked with the gifts of nature, but as a place of light separate from the darkness outside, a haven for civilization sealed off from the threatening wilderness. She fancies her husband "wondering at her absence" and opening the door, "the light pouring through the chink and then shut in again with all the safety and comfort and joy" (88). The thought of home and of her husband playing the fiddle to her baby leads her to sing less bellicose songs that incorporate both innocence and experience. She sings "the half-gay, half-melancholy Rosin the Bow" and then a sadder-still "strange U-la-lu that . .. moaned forth in loud hollow tones" (88-89). Her songs of mournfulness inspire thoughts of her impending death. Death by water, disease, or fire-any of these seems preferable to being torn apart by a panther. Her loathing of the panther reaches its most intense stage, and she perceives nature as a thoroughly hostile force, as represented by the panther, or as an indifferent force which offers no succor. Thinking of the horror of her protagonist's death, the narrator writes, "let us be ended by wild beasts, and the base cursed thing howls with us forever through the forest"- imaging the forest as a baleful rather than beneficent environment. She elaborates: The dark, hollow night rose indifferently over her; the wide, cold air breathed rudely past her, ... the great boughs swung with a ponderous strength.... The green depths were utterly cold and silent and stern. These beautiful haunts that all the summer were hers and rejoiced to share with her their bounty, these heavens that had yielded their largess, these stems that had thrust their blossoms into her hands, all these friends of three moons ago forgot her now and knew her no longer. (89) The passage signals the final step in the captive woman's progress from innocence to tempering experience regarding nature, and her songs become "wild, melancholy, forsaken songs ... weeping, wailing tunes, 51</page><page sequence="5">that sob among the people from age to age, and overflow with otherwise unexpressed sadness,-all rude, mournful ballads,-old tearful strains ... ghastly rhyming romances" (90). She has been forced to give up her simplistic, sentimental view of nature, replacing it with apparent knowledge of nature as "red in tooth and claw." It is a shift not just from innocence to experience, but, as is appropriate given the aesthetic shift just beginning to take place as Spofford was writing, from romanticism to realism and naturalism. Like the romantics, Spofford's protagonist at first idealizes nature, but like the realists and naturalists, she comes to perceive it as indifferent at best and potentially hostile. Her realizations also provide the basis for a shift from a sentimental view of nature to one incorporating ecological awareness. The woman's melodic dark night of the soul leads her to ponder "what sins she had committed, what life she had led, to find her punishment so soon and in these pangs," and amid her "spiritual fear" she begins singing hymns "full of the beauty of holiness" (90). The hymn- singing inspires the story's climax, in the form of the woman's recognition that her fate lies "in God's hands" (91). This insight makes possible her spiritual salvation as well as her physical safety, and a sign of her salvation is that she perceives anew the beauty of the natural world and her place in it. The moment she puts her trust in God, the images of nature shift back from bleakness to beauty: her "sacred anthems rose," we are told, "-rose as a hope from despair, as some snowy spray of flower-bells from blackest mould" (91). The image of rebirth in nature signals the woman's born-again faith in God, and in turn that reborn faith in God makes possible her rediscovery of nature's beauty. The woman's "harmony" with nature reaches its crescendo shortly thereafter, and the description of her sense of oneness makes apparent the ecological thrust of her epiphany. Her rediscovered faith leads the woman to recall her first communion and then to feel the present moment as the ultimate in communion-with nature as well as with God: How gently all the winter-wrapt things bent toward her then! into what relation with her had they grown! how this common dependence was the spell of their intimacy! how at one with Nature had she become! how all the night and the silence and the forest seemed to hold its breath, and to send its soul up to God in her singing! (91-92) Her sense of feeling "at one with Nature" and, especially, of a "common dependence" between herself and nature is at the heart of her proto- ecological perspective. Clearly she had felt a version of her oneness with nature before the panther attack, but it was a sympathy for nature that had not been tested and that was naive in its lack of understanding of nature's power. Now her attitude combines appreciation with awareness. Her acknowledgment of nature's power makes possible her sense of mutual dependence; her dependence on the panther is dramatically illustrated in her precarious position within its grasp, and the panther's dependence on humanity becomes apparent when her husband shows up with his rifle. But more to the point, both the panther and the woman, 52</page><page sequence="6">she sees, in addition to being mutually dependent on one another, are dependent on God: "'O Lord,"' she cries out amid her singing, "thou preservest man and beast!" (92). Generally those who have sought to identify the origins of ecological thinking have given short shrift to Christian influences. In fact, ecologists often see Christianity as one of the villains responsible for the anthropocentric frame of mind that has led to the environmental crisis. Lynn White, Jr., in "The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis," sums up the evidence against Christianity, and quite damning evidence it is, too, from an ecological perspective: Man named all the animals, thus establising his dominance over them. God planned all this explicitly for man's benefit and rule: no item in the physical creation had any purpose save to serve man's purposes. And ... he is not simply part of nature: he is made in God's image. Especially in its Western form, Christianity is the most anthropocentric religion the world has ever seen. (1205) Feminists might add that, according to Christian doctrine, even women seem to exist in order to serve man. But women at least have souls in common with men; animals and plants and rocks do not. Christianity's privileging of the human and its conception of nature as separate from and subservient to humanity is clearly antithetical to ecological principles. But other tendencies in the Christian tradition are quite compatible with ecology. Prominent in American literature since the Puritans, for instance, is the belief that the landscape, as the production of God, is a sort of natural scripture wherein God's hand can be discerned-and therefore it is sacred. Further, Joseph Meeker in The Comedy of Survival explains that Christianity, at least before the modem era, encouraged humans to see themselves not as superior to the rest of creation but as part and parcel of it: Christianity provided humanity with a way to think about the world and to respond to its conditions as participants in an order larger than themselves. However complicated, the world appeared to have a meaningful structure, and a human being's welfare appeared to depend upon his understanding of that structure and his ability to coordinate his own life with it. (181)2 That "order larger than themselves" with a "meaningful structure" to which people had to accommodate themselves constitutes nature. And the means by which we make that accommodation is through the traditional Christian virtue of humility. White points out that St. Francis of Assisi, whom he nominates as a "patron saint for ecologists," recommended humility "not merely for the individual but for man as a species" (1206-07). Humility might lead us to respect other life forms as equals in our own eyes as well as in God's. In "Circumstance" the protagonist comes to an awareness that both she and the panther are the productions of God, that both are beloved of God, and that her fate lies very much in both the claws of the panther and the hands of God. Her 53</page><page sequence="7">predicament is a valuable corrective to any anthropocentric tendencies she might have entertained. It is no coincidence that a nineteenth-century American woman writer finds biblical support for her protagonist's sense of oneness with nature. In nineteenth-century America, after all, women more than men were associated with religion as well as nature. Barbara Welter in Dimity Convictions, her study of American women in the nineteenth century, speaks of the "feminization of American religion" in the nineteenth century. If the womanly virtues of "humility, submission and meekness" were deemed "incompatible with success" in business and politics, they were ideally suited to "traditional religious values" (84). As evidence of the nineteenth century's perception that religion falls more within the realm of women's sphere than men's, consider Sarah Grimke's comment in 1856 that "the strength of the moral world lies in woman . . in her heart religion has found its home" (qtd. in Hersh, 275).3 Spofford's story demonstrates that her era's sense of woman's special religious sensibility makes possible her closeness to nature. And that closeness to nature is at the heart of the ecofeminist vision. The other prime tenet of ecofeminist doctrine is that the patriarchal powers of our society have proved incapable of sustaining such a relationship with nature. In "Circumstance" the gun-wielding man can be taken to sym- bolize patriarchal power, and he destroys nature.4 From the perspective in which nature is deemed a hostile force, a perspective common in American romances written by men, his act seems to be an act of heroism.5 But from an ecological perspective we might read the shooting as a violent disruption of the harmony with nature that the woman achieved through her singing. The shooting results in a resumption of a polarizing value system wherein humanity and nature are once more opposed. And the man's conquest of the beast serves to assert his control over the wild. Similarly, his rescue of the woman, his reclaiming of her, also can be taken as a reassertion of control. As Fetterley points out in stressing the woman's temporary escape from domesticity, "When hus- band and child arrive at the scene, the woman loses her voice and her vision" (265). Of course, there is much to complicate this reading of the story as an affirmation of ecofeminist ideas. Clearly the woman herself perceives the panther as an antagonistic force, and her singing is more a means of survival than a celebration of her connection to nature. And she certainly does not consider her rescue any kind of violation. She shares the value system of her culture, and is perfectly happy to see the beast killed. But we do not have to believe that the shooting solution, which husband, wife, and author all seem to approve of, is necessarily the only or the best solution. Perhaps they all fail to recognize the new possibilities for coexisting with nature inherent in the peaceful scene where the human lies down in the embrace of the panther, just as in paradise the lion lay down with the lamb. Perhaps Spofford recognizes the lost paradisiac possibility, for the story concludes with a reminder of Milton's Paradise Lost: though the family's home is burnt, Spofford writes, "the world was all before them, where to choose" (278). The suggestion may be that by 54</page><page sequence="8">killing the panther, mankind sacrifices his-and woman's-place in Eden. Destruction of nature, then, may be the original sin, and our lost connection to nature the penalty of our fall. More likely, though, the Milton allusion suggests the fortunate side of humanity's fall. The world beyond the homestead, that of the wilderness, is a world of possibility, and Spofford's view of that world incorporates the knowledge of experience. The woman's progress from naive romanticizing of nature to a deeper, more mature and realistic understanding and acceptance of it accords with ecological principles as well as Christian ones. Even after confronting the dark side of the woods, the side that does not exist to provide human comfort or to please human aesthetics, she can appreciate the wilderness and find it useful and good. During the family's return home, she gathers berries and dead grasses for the chimney-piece, pine cones for her child to play with. She seems to resume her sympathy and appreciation for nature, and in a sense nature reciprocates. Not only does nature once more provide sustenance and aesthetic pleasure for the family, but it turns out that the panther's attack was really a sort of vigil devoted to saving the lives of the woman and her family. There is still something quite anthropocentric about this resolu- tion, of course. The beast, representative of the wild, dies in order to save the man and woman, representatives of civilization-so Spofford's viewpoint is hardly the ecological ideal of biocentrism (that is, life- centered, or taking into ethical consideration all life forms, so, in truth, not centered at all). There is also an ethnocentric bias in that she selects Indians to represent human, or even Satanic, evil. Obviously, Spofford is not free of the prejudices of her age.6 Her story also highlights a problematic issue for ecofeminists in its association of woman with nature. Clearly this association has been prominent in our literary history, leading to interpretations of the landscape as nurturing "Mother Earth" or appealing "Virgin Land," to be conquered or raped. Do ecofeminists want to perpetuate this association or deconstruct it?7 Certainly, the model for ecologically sen- sitive (and sensible) behavior in "Circumstance" seems to be the woman's harmony with nature, accepting her powerlessness in the grasp of the wild. The danger of celebrating this sort of association, however, is that our culture's denigrating perceptions of nature become attached to women and so serve to perpetuate sexist oppression. That is, women can be seen as beast-like (relying on instinct rather than reason, passion rather than intellect) or as flower-like (pretty, but passive and mindless), and so denied full humanity.s The story can also be taken to suggest that women need rescue by the civilizing power of man. On the other hand, ecofeminism's premise is precisely that the oppression of women and the destruction of nature are related problems with related solutions. Spofford's "Circumstance" seems to celebrate the association of women and wilderness, suggesting that the spiritual values represented by the woman's singing grow out of and make possible communion with nature. Just as the beast's night-long embrace of the woman saves her and her family from the depredations of "manunkind," 55</page><page sequence="9">Spofford suggests that communion with nature, even when it is feared or misunderstood, is the unrecognized savior of the human family. Pennsylvania State University NOTES 1. Quite a bit of ecofeminist theory has been emerging in the last decade or so. For useful introductions to the subject, see Jim Cheney's "Eco-Feminism and Deep Ecology," Elizabeth Dodson Gray's Green Paradise Lost, Ynestra King's "The Ecology of Feminism and the Feminism of Ecology" and "Feminism and the Revolt of Nature," Carolyn Merchant's The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution, Janice Monk's "Approaches to the Study of Women and the Landscape," Judith Plant's collection Healing the Wounds: The Promise of Ecofeminism, Karen J. Warren's "Feminism and Ecology: Making Connections," and Michael Zimmerman's "Feminism, Deep Ecology, and Environmental Ethics." This list is by no means a complete one, but it provides an introduction to most of the key issues dealt with by ecofeminists. 2. In contrast to this Christian view of the past, Meeker says that in recent times "Western civilization has operated largely on the assumption that the world must be shaped and managed to conform to human needs and interests" (181-82). That is the sort of anthropocentrism that has led to environmental catastrophe, and the Christian tradition has indeed at times been invoked to support such a world view. But it is not necessarily inherent in the Christian tradition, since it can also be invoked, as Spofford does, to support an environmentally sensitive view. 3. Hersh cites many comments from nineteenth-century women activists that emphasize their sense of woman's special religious and moral function. For other critical commentary on the association of women and religion in nineteenth-century America, see Ann Douglas's The Feminization of American Culture. While critics have separately noted the associations of women with nature and religion, few have elaborated on the potential connection between the two. 4. The phallic associations of guns are commonplace in literature. For a convivial but thoroughly sexist exploration of the metaphor, see Robert Burn's "Epistle to Rankine." Written after Burns had impregnated a local (unmarried) woman, the poem makes merry with the idea that the phallus as gun is an instrument of sexual "poaching." For a female version of the metaphor, see Emily Dickinson's "My life had stood-a loaded gun." Several critics have seen the poem as Dickinson's assumption of phallic power as poet by envisioning herself as a loaded gun. Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, for instance, speak of the poem as "an extraordinary assertion of 'masculine' artistic freedom" (610). 5. An incident in Cooper's The Pioneers, when Natty Bumppo slays a panther, both parallels and contrasts with the events of Spofford's story. In Cooper's story, as in "Circumstance," the panther threatens womanhood (in the form of Elizabeth Temple and her friend Louisa Grant) and is slain by a man. But Cooper's women express only fear and helplessness when confronted by the panther. They take no action to save themselves-in fact, Louisa in true sentimental fashion faints away-and they never achieve any sort of harmony, literal or otherwise, with the panther. 56</page><page sequence="10">6. Fetterly too notes the story's racism, saying that "'Circumstance' exemplifies the insidiousness and pervasiveness of the racist imagination in white American literature" (267). 7. Several ecofeminist critics have explored this issue. Ynestra King wonders "whether the woman/nature connection is potentially liberating or simply a rationale for the continued subordination of women?" ("Feminism," 12). She concludes that "[w]ithout an ecological perspective which asserts the interdependence of living things, feminism is disembodied" (15). But Patrick Murphy argues in "Sex-Typing the Planet" that "designating an entity [the earth] female in a patriarchal culture guarantees its subservient status" (157). Further, says Murphy, emphasis on women's "naturalness" seems to obviate "the need for women to become as actively involved in psychic reintegration and intellectual development, and unconsciously reinforces a patriarchal Judaic idealization of the woman as intuitively knowledgeable and, hence, in no need of education" (166). Joan Griscom objects to the association of women with nature as a result of biological differences because it "sets up a new hierarchical dualism" in which "women are relatively 'good' (closer to nature) and men relatively 'bad' (farther from nature)." Such hierarchies, says Griscom, are antithetical to "a true ecological vision" in which "all participate equally" and diversity is welcomed (8). In her seminal article "Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?" Sherry Ortner also finds the association of women with nature problematic. She believes that the association restricts women's role and denies them full standing in society. 8. Kristin Herzog in Women, Ethnics, and Exotics notes that these biases apply to non-whites as well as women in our culture. Both are perceived as "more passive, less logical; more imaginative, less technically inclined; more emotional, less incisive; and more religious, less scientifically oriented" (xi-xii). Nature, too, in our culture is perceived as the anti-thesis of logic, technology, and science. WORKS CITED Bendixen, Alfred. "Introduction." Spofford, ix-xxxvii. Cheney, Jim.
