NEUMAIER DARGYAY A PERSONAL PREAMBLE Many years ago a fellow Tibetologist and historian of religion had sent me a review article written by him on The Meaning and End of Religion, authored by Wilfred Cantwell Smith, a name which did not mean anything to me—yet.' I still lived in Germany, and the theoretical work of North American scholars rarely made it across the Atlantic. The review took offense at W. C. Smith's stance that the believer has a role to play in the definition of the research subject taken from a religious context. In its largely negative mood the review provoked me to read the book. Reading The Meaning and End of Religion truly opened new vistas on how one could understand the beliefs of other people. I was mesmerized by the humaneness, the openness, the humility I found in this book. Here, I felt, was a way out of what I considered to be the restraints of nineteenth century philolology. My frustration with the staleness of the academic inquiry had found an end. I decided to write a letter to the unknown author whose views I found so intriguing and stimulating. W. C. Smith invited me to the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Religion in St. Louis. Attending the conference was an eye-opening experience. The apparent absence of colonial arrogance in the North-American academy impressed me deeply. When the opportunity came, I gladly left the continent behind me. Thus, I am ' Wilfred Canlwell Smith, The Meaning and End of Religion (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1978), Copyright © Eva K. Neumaier Dargyay 1993.</page><page sequence="2">70 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) truly grateful that as a participant of this symposium I have an opportunity to acknowledge publicly what I owe to Wilfred Cantwell Smith. He has initiated my mutation from a philologist and historian of Asian literatures to a student of religion and he has shaped my thinking in a very profound way. My contribution is intended to express my indebtedness, my gratitude for meeting the man and his work. My inquiry orbits around such concepts as God, the divine, faith, and it tries to bring them into a dialectic discourse with Buddhism. As the person who orchestrates this discourse I am situated in the post-modern context of critical theory, that is to say, I do not privilege one stance; rather I am attempting to open fissures, to point at gaps which may open possibilities for further discourse. I The following discussion is certainly inspired by W. C. Smith's insights but at the same time tries to go beyond it. In Faith and Belief, W. C. Smith takes up a notion widespread among Western scholars of Buddhism, that is, that Buddhism is, or at least was in its earlier phases, a religion denying the existence of God/gods, and which, for this reason, deservedly may be called atheistic.2 Smith comes to the conclusion that this is not quite so. First, I would like to reflect on the claim that Buddhism is atheistic by examining what the Buddhist texts say about this issue, how Buddhists respond to the claim, and how it may be understood within our own context. Buddhist texts throughout the ages contain passages which record the doings of deva, a Sanskrit word etymologically connected to the Latin deus from which the English words divine, divinity, and deity are derived. Commonly, deus is considered to be the equivalent to English god/God. In the earlier texts of Buddhism the common gods of India are mentioned: Indra, Brahma, etc.; in later texts Vishnu, Skanda, Shiva, and others displaced the earlier gods—as it happened in other Indian belief systems too. In the Mahayana and Vajrayana texts of Central Asia, indigenous gods figure prominently side by side with the imported Indian gods. Many references are found in the texts affirming the existence of gods in this universe. From these observations it would seem unreasonable to claim that Buddhism is atheistic if there were not the rejection of the : Faith and Belief (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), 20-32.</page><page sequence="3">Smith, Buddhism, and the Divine 71 concept of ishvara, one god responsible for the creation of this universe. Buddhist texts pointed out that it is logically untenable to assume that an anthropomorphic being of the category 'god' could be responsible for the world as it is and still maintain the claim that this god is omniscient, almighty, and benign. It is therefore only one function of one of the many gods which is firmly rejected in Buddhist thought.3 But this function of a god is the one which truly matters in the Western mind shaped as it is by Christian monotheism. Anyway, monotheistic theologians did not care much about the many gods worshipped in other religions; they preferred to trivialize them to figures of myth while maintaining that their own god was the only real god that deserved to be written with capital 'G' and to be addressed as He. But exactly this understanding of god was rejected in Buddhist thought, and thus Buddhism became branded as 'atheistic' in Western writings. A look into the criticism launched by Hindu and Confucian theorists at Buddhism tells us that they did not accuse the Buddhists of atheism but focused in their judgement on the short shrift family values, sacrifices, or asceticism received in the Buddhist system. Wilfred Cantwell Smith introduced the idea that a subject matter of the study of religion is only an authentic object of scholarly studies if the believers agree that the chosen subject is truly part of their own belief system. If we apply this idea to the topic under discussion, then we will observe that Buddhists not heavily exposed to monotheism (in its Christian, Jewish, or Muslim strand) will reject the assumption that their own belief excludes the concept of god(s). The labelling of Buddhism as atheistic is a construct of Western thinking as it took shape under the influence of the enlightenment. At a time when many Western intellectuals found it difficult to maintain a belief in an omniscient and almighty god in the light of scientific discoveries; they seemed to welcome a belief which integrated humanistic ethics with the rejection of a supreme creator god, and called it atheistic despite the fact that it recognized the existence of gods—although not as the primary ground of the universe. ' Eva K. Dargyay, "The Concept of a 'Creator God' in Tannic Buddhism," The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 8 (1985): 32-35 discusses the 'atheistic' side of Buddhism in more detail.</page><page sequence="4">72 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) II In the Western/Christian conception of God several ideas conflated: the anthropomorphic patriarch god of the Hebrews and philosophical assumptions about a force that is at the ground of the universe while sustaining it at the same time. As we saw, Buddhism certainly negates the first idea, i.e., that of a patriarchal god ruling over the world like a despot over his principality. But Buddhism did not reject the idea that there is a force which sustains the universe and which makes its existence as it is possible. In Faith and Belief Smith examined several Buddhist concepts which figure prominently within the system and probed whether they could function in a role similar to the philosophical idea of God seen as source of the universe in the monotheistic systems. After pointing out that nirvana—for many western thinkers a seemingly obvious candidate in this context—does not occupy such a central place in Buddhist thinking, he turned to an examination of dharma which he understood as a metaphysics of morality and argued that the moral law, i.e., dharma, is beyond the impermanence of all phenomena, and that it gives meaning. I shall return to this point shortly. Wilfred Cantwell Smith pointed out that the phrase "the further shore" permeates much of early Buddhist texts. And rightly so; it is one of the most ancient metaphors used in the texts to articulate the transformation from an existence entangled in impermanence and its ensuant dissatisfaction to one beyond such circumstances, that is, the fording of the river. The other shore is the metaphor for nirvana, a quality of being, unknown to those who are not yet awakened. If seen from a perspective of geography, then the metaphor of the other shore suggests escapism. It signifies the distance between here and there, the now and then. But when seen from a perspective of experience, of wading through the waters of a major river, then the metaphor seems to suggest an inner transformation. A person entering the unfathomable waters undergoes an experience of metamorphosis whose outcome is beyond imagination. Only the uncanny feeling of losing the body's heaviness and solidity permeates the mind. If we take the experience of fording a river on foot as the vantage point from which we ought to understand the metaphor of crossing the river, then it seems to point at the integration of the experience of the Other with our own lived embodiedness. Metaphorically, the Other is signified through the water, and as the water seems to enter our own embodiedness so that we loose control over the matter of our body, (so that it seems to dissolve in the water), we not</page><page sequence="5">Smith, Buddhism, and the Divine 73 only integrate the Other with our own centre of experience, with our own enlived be-ing, but we even invite the Other to fuse with our own be-ing. In Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia Julia Kristeva seemed to suggest that the experience of primary loss, which constitutes the individual and which marks the process of individuation, is transformed into symbols of divinity.4 She used Holbein's painting of the Dead Christ to elaborate this idea. In the experience of the uncanniness of being, epitomized in the loss of the mother and in death, solace is found. In the darkness of the void is the warmth and comfort of the Other. If my analysis of the metaphor of crossing the river has any validity to it, then the Buddhist objective is the integration of the Other, of the uncanny with our own lived centeredness. There is ample evidence in Buddhist texts to indicate that the integration of the Other is the main objective of the process of spiritual transformation. This Other is never reified; it remains ambiguous, unsignified, and unsignifying. It is only present—the uncanny in its dread and its beauty. In later Buddhist texts the term sûnya (void, empty, or open), becomes the predominant metaphor for Other. The awe of the Other is captured in the negativity of language. Some Buddhist thinkers said that teaching sûnyatâ to the immature will cause fear and terror. They may feel like falling into an abyss. So it should not be done. But then sûnyatâ is also sheer bliss. In the mystical experience of Other is a dialectic leap from awe and dread to bliss. The night of the soul darkens in its darkness so much that another sun arises from within this darkness. Kristeva saw this experience encapsulated in the narrative of Christ's death and resurrection. It is the sun of darkness rising over the land of melancholia. In a profound interpretation of Holbein's painting of the Dead Christ she illuminated this dynamics. To discuss Buddhism's version of this experience, I like to introduce excerpts of the Cullasuññata sutta which is included in the Majjhima Nikâya.5 This text had attracted the attention of a few scholars as it mentions that after all sensory phenomena subsided, voidness remains and "the rest of it thereafter." This phrase gave rise to several speculations 4 Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia (New York: Columbia Universily Press, 1989), 132 ff. 4 The following expositions on 'Buddhist experience' disregard the chronology of texts and the history of their continuous revision and re-writing. It is assumed that the multiplicity nnd diversity of what constitutes 'Buddhist experience' is a projection of a situation of inter-textuality whereby no text, and no canon is the sole source for making the discourse happen.</page><page sequence="6">74 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1 -4/2 (1992) among traditional Buddhist scholars whether there is something outside and beyond voidness* I present the text for other reasons. I see in it a witness of the experience of the uncanny, of the dark hole, which— miraculously—transforms itself into an experience of bliss. Because of the archaic style and its ensuant difficulty of the text, I intersperse the translation with my interpretation.7 The sutta starts with a question raised by Ananda whether he had heard properly when remembering that the Buddha was saying, "I—through abiding in emptiness—am now abiding in the fullness thereof." The Buddha confirms that, yes, Ananda had heard and understood correctly what he had said, but then goes on to explicate the phrase. He describes situations which are empty of one thing and not empty of another thing. In other words, the Buddha discusses ambiguity. For a moment I want to stop here and remind ourselves that the openness of discourse, the ambiguity of language and text, whether put into writing or not, is a concept influencing much of post-modern thinking. First the Buddha talks about the emptiness and non-emptiness of the palace of King Migâra's mother: As this palace of Migâra's mother is empty of elephants, cows, horses, and mares, empty of gold and silver, empty of assemblages of men and women, and there is only this that is not emptiness, that is to say the oneness [ekatta also solitude, unity] grounded on the order of monks; even so, Ananda, a monk, not attending to the perception of village, not attending to the perception of human beings, attends to the oneness grounded on the perception of forest. His mind is satisfied with, pleased with, set on and freed in the perception of the plane of no-thing." The description of the palace as being void of the usual characteristics of such a place may also be seen as a description of loss. The palace has lost its characteristics. No reason is given why these characteristics became absent. We don't know whether their absence is due to the monk's way of perceiving things or whether these things had disappeared " Lobsang Dargyay, "What is Non-Existent and What is Remanent in SûnyatâV Journal of Indian Philosophy 18 (1990): 81-91. 7 It should be noticed that these are not the only ways of understanding and contextualizing this sulla. One may see in it an early account of certain Buddhist yoga techniques. To me such an interpretation seems specious since it does not address why the experiences, as articulated in the text, were so important to the Buddhists. Furthermore, if we encase the text in its Orientalism, in its exotic otherness, we prevent its unlocking so that it can speak to us. * The Middle Length Sayings (Majjltima Nikáya), Vol. 3, trans. I. B. Horner (London: Pali Text Society, Luzac &amp; Company, 1967), 149.</page><page sequence="7">Smith, Buddhism, and the Divine 75 in their physical properties. The question may be asked, what makes a building, empty of these things which distinguish a palace from an ordinary dwelling, still a palace? But this question is not entertained by the text. But there is one phenomenon which is not characterized through its absence and that is ekatta, oneness, the text says. I. B. Horner understands the term ekatta as the solitude of the monk ascetics. If this is the proper understanding of the term, why then, I am asking, does this solitude result in setting the monk free at the plane of no-thing? In the light of later Buddhist texts, yet of the same contemplative strand as this one, I suggest to understand ekatta as oneness, that is as the dissolving of boundaries and distinctions as characteristic of many mystical experiences. Is this meant to be the reason why elephants, steeds, cows, and servants had vanished from the palace? If the boundaries marking the distinctiveness and separateness of phenomena disappear, we certainly fail to perceive them in their individuality and peculiarity. Phenomena without characteristics cease to be individual and distinct phenomena; they become unidentifiable; they blend into a total black-out or white-out. In the subsequent paragraphs the sutta guides the monk from the experience of the loss of physical things to the loss of spiritual and yogic experiences. Several 'planes' of yogic awareness are transcended, one after the other. That these are true losses, that is, sensations which upset the emotional and psychological well-being, is indicated by the word 'disturbance' which is said to be the result of the perception of oneness but also of absence. This absence is not the absence of one concrete thing which could be named and identified; rather it is the primary loss of which Kristeva was speaking. The text may be seen as a document mapping the human experience and indicating that loss qualifies our entire existence, even if we pretend to move from one spiritual achievement to the other. Things dissolve into the indistinguishable, into emptiness; even the Buddhist principles, like the four-fold noble truth, are no exception. The sutta draws to an end with this statement: He [i.e., the monk] regards lhal which is not there as empty of it. But in regard to what remains he comprehends; "That being this is." Thus, Ananda, this comes to be for him a true, not mistaken, utterly purified and incomparable highest realization of emptiness * 'Op. cit. 151 f.</page><page sequence="8">76 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) If we translate this sentence into the language I am suggesting here, then we may understand this sentence as saying that an absent absence is fullness, or, the loss of loss reverses the dark into sun. If understood in this way, the text speaks of the basic human condition by suggesting that the dissolving of boundaries marks the transition from an identifiable loss to primary loss. But the text does not end with this notion of despair. Immersing oneself in the loss, the loss transforms itself into fullness. Buddhist sacred art seems to support this interpretation. To make my point, I have to turn to the Buddhist art of Mahayana and Vajrayana. Almost all of the allegoric figures of the Mahayana pantheon are known in a benign and a wrathful form—much to the astonishment of Westerners. I am suggesting that we see the wrathful forms of bodhisattvas and Buddhas as a symbolic representation of the pain of loss, of absence, an acknowledgment of the darkness residing inside the human being. The agony of Christ nailed to the cross, the rage of a Mahâkâla, the fury of Shrîdevî narrate in their symbolic re-presentation the intrinsically human experience of loss, of mourning, and of rage. All these re-presentations of the melancholic side of human existence are transfigured into light and life. Christ is resurrected, Mahâkâla, the Buddhist equivalent of the Big Reaper, is transformed into the embodiment of compassion, Avalokiteshvara, and Shrîdevî is transfigured into Târâ, the female Buddha. Thus, I like to argue, Buddhism knows of the Other as a giver of meaning after its total loss. This is certainly an experience signified through the word the divine. Kristeva talked about the divine as a 'hypersign' which summons up primary processes and idealization and which is woven around and with the depressive void."1 This is disturbingly close to the experience articulated in the Cullasuññata sutta: the dissolving of boundaries, the falling into the abyss of loss and depression, and the subsequent rising from the depth. What fascinated Kristeva in the Christ narrative, begins to come forth also in the Buddhist experience. What may annoy the Western mind when reading the Buddhist texts is the multiplicity of symbols, and their ambiguity. Post modernism and deconstruction should prove helpful here. Another factor, one to which I will return at the end of my deliberations, is the non human nature of the Buddhist narrative. The force which sustains the universe, and which became visible in the Cullasuññata sutta, is of a psychological quality. It sustains a Dark Sun, 99.</page><page sequence="9">Smith, Buddhism, and the Divine 77 universe within us. But there are also texts which suggest that this force can be seen in a different way, more like a cosmic force. I am turning now to a Buddhist text, the Kun byed rgyal po'i mdo, (i.e., the Sutra of the All-Creating Sovereign), which belongs to the multi-faceted tradition of contemplative Buddhism which emerged in China as Ch'an and in Tibet as rDzogs-chen around the 8th century C.E." In this text a non-physical potency is considered to be the ground of the universe. This non-physical potency is paraphrased as "all creating mind of perfect purity." This phrase indicates that this mind is not the mind operative in our daily life experience, or, to use Buddhist terminology, it is not the mind as one of the five skandha, or aggregates constituting existence. It is a mental, that is a creative and sentient, potency which is transpersonal. It is at the root of be-ing itself; it is the root or ground of all that exists. In the framework of Buddhist theory, it predates the existence of Buddhas, the teaching, and the community. Because of its primary position, it cannot be reified in any way. It cannot be thought of; it cannot be understood—at least not in analytical terms; it does not stipulate any moral law because it is what is. The text makes it very clear that this potency actuates itself only in existence; it is not something outside or beyond existence. But existence does not reveal the whole depth of this potency. Thus existence is saturated with this potency which is represented as a benevolent force although without any human characteristics and properties. In this text reality as the totality of what is, understood here not in a static but dynamic sense, is divine. Consequently all actions, regardless how they are seen by the limited human mind, are acts of benevolence. This marks the end of morality as a set of prescribed behaviours. When in Faith and Belief Smith interpreted dharma as moral law, this was done under the influence of how Buddhism was perceived in the West during the early decades of this century. In Tibetan, dharma is translated as chos, and chos thams cad meansing the entirety of all that is. The Buddhist definition of truth has always been "to see things as they are." Divine truth in Buddhism is not revealed to a passive recipient by an agent; rather truth reveals itself within oneself whereby the human being is one of the limitless locales where this truth manifests. The human species does not have a privileged or exclusive position. Primarily " E. K. Neumaier Dargyay, The Sovereign All-Creating Mind: The Motherly Buddha. A Translation of tlte Kun byed rgyal po'i mdo (Albany: Stale University of New York Press, 1992).</page><page sequence="10">78 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) all that is sentient is capable of this awakening (i.e., nirvana), but some texts expand this notion to include all that is. Thus nirvana is not only available to humans, or all sentient beings, but to the universe as the totality of what exists. The meaning Buddhism constructs is found in the fleeting and ephemeral phenomena; it is the quality of an endlessly fluid ocean of impermanence. Whether one sees oneself drifting amidst it, willingless and meaningless, or whether one sees oneself spinning with the fleeting phenomena in a cosmic dance which has no meaning outside of its own, this determines whether one is considered to be in samsara or in nirvana. Smith has observed that within the ceaseless change of all that exists Buddhists were certain that there is the Other, the further shore, nirvana.12 What the monotheist may find so disturbing and irritating is that there is no help available outside of one's self. Western scholars, in search for what could be seen as the common denominator among all religions, attempted to redefine Buddhism so that it could be called "theistic—in a way." The last part of my presentation will try to address some of the issues which a monotheistic theologian may find upsetting when dealing with Buddhism. Ill In Totem and Taboo Freud suggested that religion is a symbolic transformation of the inner turmoil and the guilt stemming from the patricide committed by the sons of the primal horde.'3 They killed their father, ate his flesh in their desire to gain access to his woman (their mother) and to acquire his power. The patricide committed as a collective crime by all the brothers pitched them in envy against one another. None allowed the others to have access to the mother. The creation of the incest taboo was one of the responses; the other was to idolize the slain father and transform him into the first ancestor, the totem. The guilt of patricide, Freud argued, restructured itself in the symbolic as religion, and also as other symbolic systems. Thus we may say that not God created man in his image but man created god in the image of himself. Freud saw in this event, which he wanted to locate in " Failli and Belief, 26. 11 Sigmund Freud, Totem and Taboo: Some Points of Agreement Between the Mental Lives of Savages and Neurotics, trans. James Strachey. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1950), 125, 176.</page><page sequence="11">Smith, Buddhism, and the Divine 79 the distant prehistory of humanity, as a factual occurrence, the root from which all symbolic systems arose. Where monotheistic theologies were inclined to see god as agent of revelation, Freud saw the dynamics of human drives at work. In the monotheistic theologies the recognition of God is structured around the loss of innocence, the loss of paradise, the loss of obedience. God is a hypersign, to use Kristeva's term, constructed around the dark hole which seems to rest in the human mind independent from individual, cultural, and socio-historical contexts (after all, virtually every religious belief gives one or the other explanation for the arbitrariness of life, for the plight of the human condition, and for death). If the hypersign's only objective is to provide the melancholy human with meaning, then it may be appropriate to construct it in human terms—as father, mother, friend, etc. But if the hypersign should also serve as a plausible possibility to be the ground from which the cosmos came into existence and which sustains it in its changes and evolutions, then the question needs to be asked why one species among billions of other species populating one tiny planet in a marginal solar system of a smaller galaxy should have the privilege to use its own psychic organization to construct a symbol which gives meaning to the entire cosmos. If in our critical discourse we move away from accepting exclusive and privileged positions as natural, then the species exclusivity of monotheistic theologies has to be addressed. The monotheistic theologies were pre-occupied with the human condition and structured the universe around it. Non-humans played only an ancillary role as resource for the one species which claimed to be made in God's image. Non-monotheistic religions, among them Buddhism, see the human species within a larger context of numerous life forms of which it constitutes only one part. Buddhism created a rich cosmography which fills the cosmos with numerous worlds, each filled with an endless assortment of living and sentient beings. In Buddhism the human species is privileged only in so far as it has participated equally in joy and pain. But the realization of a state of wholeness, i.e., nirvana, is not the exclusive property of humanity. Zen Buddhism asked, Does a dog have Buddha nature? In a non-species specific theological context one may ask, What hypersign would articulate a dog's experience, or What is a dog's 'Buddha nature'? Is the fact that Buddhism does not accredit humanity with a privileged position within the cosmos one of the reasons why monotheistic theologians feel so uncomfortable with it? Thinking about the construction of Other/divine in Buddhism seems to open possibilities for endless speculations.</page><page sequence="12">80 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) The texts which articulate the Buddhist experience seem to affirm the impression that the believers structured meaning by assuming that there is the Other, i.e., the unborn, nirvana. Thus the Buddhist experience seems to converge with some of the religious experiences of people belonging to other traditions. But the Buddhist experience differs in its articulation as it does not privilege the symbolic and experiential vocabulary of one species although it does not attempt to articulate that of other species.
