Il s'6tait empar6 de nos salons, de nos thiatres, de nos ateliers, de nos expositions de peinture. Il teignait de ses couleurs l'histoire et le roman; il 6tendait son influence sur les fantaisies de la mode, sur les ameublements, les costumes. ...' The influence of Walter Scott's novels permeated French art and literature during the first half of the nineteenth century.2 The enthusiastic depiction of subjects from Scott by French artists was partly a response to Scott's popu- larity and partly an attempt to utilize his achievement in literature as the model for a new form of painting, in an age in which the traditional economic and aesthetic delimitations were shifting. Scott had created a new literary genre: the historical novel. A blend of fictional literature and historical documentation, it was simultaneously didactic (but not pedantic) and entertain- ing (but not frivolous). Because of its style and format, it This article is based on research done for my Ph.D. dissertation, "The In- fluence of the Historical Novels of Sir Walter Scott on the Changing Nature of French History Painting 1815-1855," University of California, Berkeley, 1978. The dissertation contains a chronological list of Scott- related paintings submitted for exhibition and exhibited in France be- tween 1815 and 1855, and an alphabetical catalogue of the approximately 150 artists who produced these paintings, including biographical material, provenance of the works, and references to contemporary critical discussion. I have benefited greatly from the advice and en- couragement of Jacques de Caso, who supervised the dissertation. I would like to thank Catherine Gordon for her generous assistance in regard to English paintings of Scott subjects, and Lynn R. Matteson for his suggestions on the manuscript. I would also like to express my grateful appreciation to the following people for their patient and cour- teous assistance: Mme. Laffitte-Larnaudie of the Bibliotheque des Archives de l'Institut de France; M. Carolus-Barr6 and Mme. Cantarel- Besson of the Departement des Archives, Musee du Louvre; M. Jacques Foucart of the Service d'Etude et de Documentation, Musee du Louvre; and M. Jean Adhemar and the entire staff of the Cabinet des Estampes, Bibliotheque Nationale. 1 Armand de Pontmartin, Souvenirs d'un vieux critique, 10 vols., Paris, 1881-89, vIII, 230-31. 2 The French literary response to Scott has recently been the topic of an exceptionally detailed and useful analysis: Klaus Massmann, Die Rezep- tion der historischen Romane Sir Walter Scotts in Frankreich (1816- 1832) (Studia Romantica, xxiv), Heidelberg, 1972, which contains an in- dex of critical reviews of the novels in French periodicals between 1815 and 1842. Catherine Gordon has provided a very stimulating assessment of Scott's impact on English visual art in two articles: "The Illustration of Sir Walter Scott: 19th Century Enthusiasm and Adaptation," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, xxxiv, 1971, 297-317, and "Scott's Impact on Art," Apollo, July, 1973, 36-39. Although many of the influences she points out were also affecting French artists during the same period, the social and artistic heritages in France and England were sufficiently different so that Scott's impact assumed different forms in the two countries. The influence of book illustration and engravings, which had been well established and prestigious media in England since the beginning of the 18th century, only became commercially significant in France after the Bourbon restoration. They were increasingly seen by French critics as potentially dangerous devaluations of paintings to the level of servile textual explications. In addition, the social factors that en- couraged the production of paintings of themes from popular literature had also been in effect in England long before their appearance in France. Such factors would include the lack of ecclesiastical patronage and a dwindling pool of aristocratic patrons, with a consequent need to produce art directed to a mass audience rather than an elite sector. Thus, while Scott was incorporated into a preexisting pictorial approach in England, he was an important model for an innovative pictorial genre in France.</page><page sequence="2">SCOTT'S NOVELS AND FRENCH PAINTING 269 reached a wide audience. Precisely the same combination was being sought in the pictorial arts. During this period, the centralized system of artistic production that had regulated financial support, style, subject matter, exhibition and professional recognition was breaking down under accumulated economic and political pressures.3 The demise of this system left un- satisfied the need for a new form of painting that could appeal to the new mass audience (and hence prove com- mercially successful), while remaining aesthetically and intellectually significant. Thus, the breakdown of the traditional hierarchies of genres in France was followed by a search for a pictorial compromise between peinture d'histoire and peinture de genre, in a form of painting that could continue to inform and elevate through the depic- tion of historical scenes and personages but in small-scale, anecdotal works.4 This type of painting, referred to as peinture de genre historique or peinture anecdotique, was ideally suited to the depiction of episodes from Scott's novels. Scott-related paintings proliferated during the 1820's and 1830's and were exhibited in the Salon du Louvre, in Parisian exhibitions organized by the Socie6te des Amis des Arts or by Henri Gaugain, and in the in- creasingly numerous and influential exhibitions arranged by provincial artistic societies.5 The movement toward a visual translation of Scott's literary precedent was weakened by a legacy of the theory of genre hierarchies: the concept of the fraternal union of art and literature. The humanist formula ut pictura poesis had compared poetry and painting with respect to their imitation of nature, their creation of "noble" subjects (fre- quently demanding considerable erudition), and their general purpose (instruction, elevation, and entertainment through the portrayal of significant human action and emotion). Certain formal criteria were even adapted to pic- torial terms, such as the Aristotelian unities of time, ac- tion, and place. In the nineteenth century, this formal as well as thematic comparison between poetry and painting evolved into an exhortation of painting to imitate literature. This trend ultimately compromised the pictorial use of Scott, since the lengthy and complicated narratives found in prose were far more difficult to translate into visual form than poetic imagery. Should the artist attempt a completely accurate translation of the episode into a visual format, he could be criticized for his servile adherence to the text, devoid of any pictorial originality. Conversely, the artist who dared to represent the literary text in a self-sufficient art work could find himself criticized for failing to convey all the complex charac- terization and dramatic impact of the original narrative. Furthermore, the growing importance of graphic media, especially book illustration, had a crucial impact on the form of narrative painting. We shall see how the inter- dependence of graphic and pictorial media resulted in first an identical aim, style, and even personnel (as in the case of the Johannot brothers), and later an increasing dis- satisfaction on the part of painters and critics with the possibilities of an art linked to literature. The response of French painters to Scott's novels can be charted in four stages. Between 1814 and 1826 there was increasing curiosity, as the immediate enthusiasm of literary critics, historians, and writers was slowly matched with a pictorial exploration of Scott's oeuvre. The period of the most numerous pictorial explorations occurred be- tween 1827 and 1833. Thereafter, there was an abrupt decline in the number of paintings after Scott between 1834 and 1841, testifying to an ambivalent attitude toward the pictorial representation of the novels and surely owing in part to the death of Scott in 1832. Between 1842 and 1855 we find a few Scott-related paintings present in 3An idea of the magnitude of this change can be obtained from the com- parative statistics on the Salons of 1827 and 1837 published by the Journal des artistes: although the number of artists exhibiting works had nearly doubled (from 550 to 907), the number of classically-derived historical subjects (histoire heroique, grecque et romaine) was halved (from 200 to 102). ("Statistique comparative des Salons de 1827 et 1837," Journal des artistes, I, May 21, 1837, 326-29). 4 The painters of the 6cole de Lyon, headed by Fleury-Frangois Richard and Pierre-Henri Revoil, had already produced "troubadour" paintings that depicted subjects from medieval and Renaissance history in an anec- dotal manner for private collectors. We should be cautious, however, about ascribing a direct line of development in French painting from these works to the slightly later paintings of historical subjects from Scott's novels. They may be comparable with respect to their interest in antiquarian decor and sentimental anecdote, but the major impulse in the depiction of Scott episodes was the translation of a literary text into a visual image. The painters of the 6cole de Lyon were careful to select an episode from historical legend that could rarely be ascribed to a particular text, so that they could concentrate on strictly visual concerns. s The "Musee Colbert" was the site for exhibitions by the artists' own fraternal organization, the Societe des Amis des Arts. The "Galerie Lebrun" was the site for exhibitions organized by Henri Gaugain, a publisher of lithographs of the Romantic school. The Globe remarked, in reference to the exhibit at the Galerie Lebrun in 1826 benefiting the cause of Greek nationalism: "... cette exposition en faveur des Grecs est le signal d'une veritable scission entre l'dlite de nos peintres et les protec- teurs de leur art; elle est le premier moddle d'un nouveau salon de pein- ture, ou plut6t elle est le salon de 1826 ... ("L.V. " "Exposition de tableaux au benefice des Grecs [rue du Gros Chenet, no 4]," Le Globe, May 23, 1826). The provinces could serve as another court of appeal for artists whose works had been refused by the Salon du Louvre in Paris. Such ex- hibitions could also permit critics to modify their original verdict, often rendered under the hindrance of bad placement and lighting, and could popularize Parisian artists on a national level. My analysis of the produc- tion of Scott-related paintings is therefore based on the perusal of the Archives du Salon du Louvre in regard to works submitted for exhibition (since the Salon juries were notoriously harsh in their judging of Roman- tic peinture de genre historique), and exhibition catalogues of the Mushe Colbert, the Galerie Lebrun and other sporadic exhibitions in Paris (such as the exhibition "au profit des bless6s" of 1830). I have also examined catalogues of exhibitions organized by the Societe des Amis des Arts in the cities of Lyon, Douai, Arras, Lille, Cambrai, Valenciennes, Caen, Montpellier, Versailles, Dunkerque, Dijon, and Bordeaux between 1814 and 1855, as well as Parisian reviews of such exhibitions.</page><page sequence="3">270 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1981 VOLUME LXIII NUMBER 2 nearly every exhibition.6 We should be wary, however, of attributing this lessened quantity of paintings to a simple rejection of Scott's novels as suitable thematic material for representation. The growth of a veritable picture industry, reproducing Scott's characters and situations in paintings, engravings, lithographs, and vignettes, had by its mass production encouraged the divorce of painting as a fine art from literary illustration which was general by mid- century. But Scott's historical novels had irrevocably altered the way in which history was perceived, and hence the way in which it was to be depicted, and the legacy of his achievement had been assimilated into French culture long after the flurry of direct illustration had ceased. ... rien ne lui manquait pour se placer en premiere ligne au nombre des romanciers et des historiens ... ses romans sont des drames remplis de verite et d'int&amp;rit, oi tour-a-tour figurent, agissent, se meuvent toutes les classes de la societe; o6 chacun parle le langage qui lui est propre, est peint avec les moeurs, les usages, les habitudes du pays auquel il appartient. ... Les faits les plus importans de l'histoire, les circonstances les plus communes de la vie priv6e ... sont jetes avec art. ... Avec tant de qualites precieuses reunies dans un seul &amp;crivain, Walter-Scott devait non seulement faire epoque dans la litterature anglaise, mais aussi dans la n6tre.7 Scott's popularity in France during the years between 1816 and 1827 can be described only in superlatives. An idea of the omnipresence of his works can be obtained from these statistics: in 1830, three fourths of the novels by English authors published in France, and one third of all the novels published in France were by Scott.8 There were many reasons for his stunning impact on French fic- tional and historical literature. Foremost among them was his success in rendering historical reality with a brilliant sense of pageantry and dramatic conflict, as well as a con- summate understanding of human nature and meticulously accurate descriptions of armor, idiom, mores, costume, and furnishings. Scott did not confine himself to "romances" with a cardboard cast of historical characters. Instead he depicted social, ethnic, and religious conflict during years of historical transition and progress, portray- ing the milieu through the behavior of the characters as well as through their setting.9 This sense of living history, produced by and influencing the actions of the populace, would naturally appeal to Frenchmen who had survived thirty years of turbulent history.1o The popularity and the literary merit of Scott's novels certainly encouraged their pictorial reproduction, but a direct influence on that pictorial transformation was Scott's visual and anecdotal style." His descriptions were always concrete as well as evocative, and his descriptions of dramatic conflicts were punctuated with tableaux 6 The number of paintings representing themes from Scott that were sub- mitted for exhibition in the Salon du Louvre, elsewhere in Paris, or in the provinces varied as follows: prior to 1822: none located 1822-26: 1-7 per year 1827-1833: 20-30 per year, except for an abrupt decline in 1832 to 4, probably due to the cholera epidemic in Paris during that year 1834-1841 6-16 per year, although an increasing percentage of these appear in the less strictly juried provincial exhibitions 1842-1855: 1-7 per year 7 "Oeuvres completes de Walter Scott," Le Corsaire, July 22, 1826, 2. 1 In 1830, approximately 220 novels (some of them published simultaneously in several editions) were published in France. Of these, 111 were by English authors, and 82 of them were by Scott (M. G. Devonshire, The English Novel in France 1830-1870, London, 1929, 6). Modern familiarity with the phenomenon of the "best seller" should not blind us to one reason for French admiration for Scott: their awed respect for his fertile imagination and huge oeuvre, and amazement at the in- numerable editions of his works that flooded the bookstores. The major French translator of Scott, Defauconpret, was believed to have provided the publisher Gosselin with the means of selling 1,400,000 volumes of Scott by 1832 (each novel running to several volumes) (Amedee Pichot, "Walter Scott," Revue de Paris, XLII, September, 1832, 339-348). 9 Scott's view of history has been studied in several stimulating articles and monographs recently, among them those by David Daiches, "Sir Walter Scott and History," Etudes anglaises, xxlV, 1971, 458-477; P. D. Garside, "Scott, the Romantic Past and the Nineteenth Century," Review of English Studies, New Series, xxiii, 1972, 147-161; Francis Hart, Scott's Novels: The Plotting of Historic Survival, Charlottesville, Va., 1966; Boris Reizov, "History and Fiction in Walter Scott's Novels," Neohelicon, II, 1974, 165-175. French critics frequently asserted that the truth and vitality of Scott's descriptions of mores and milieu justified the classification of his novels as serious historical literature. One critic wrote: ... l'histoire ne consiste pas uniquement dans certains faits, dans cer- taines dates ... les faits g6neraux, tels que l'etat social, les moeurs, les croyances, les connaissances acquises, y ont bien plus d'importance; et voila pr6cisement ce qu'il reproduit avec tant d'exactitude. ... Je crois, sans risquer beaucoup, pouvoir affirmer qu'il y a plus d'histoire dans les romans de Walter Scott que dans la moitie des historiens. ... Sir Walter Scott n'est pas un romancier qui s'avise un beau jour de devenir historien: c'est r6ellement, un historien, qui, en voulant faire des romans, ne fait pas autre chose que de l'histoire. (Felix Bodin, "Du Nouveau Roman de Walter Scott," Mercure du XIXe siecle, i, June, 1823, 453-54). The development of French historical writing in the 1820's was owed, in large part, to the response to Scott, and this was openly and gratefully acknowledged by such historians as Augustin Thierry and Prosper de Barante. See, for example, Augustin Thierry, "Sur la Conquete de I'Angleterre par les Normands. A propos du roman d'Ivanhoe," Le Cen- seur europeen, May 29, 1820. 10 Theodore Jouffroy, discussing the reaction to the publication of Old Mortality in France in 1816, described the relationship between the per- sonal experience of historical transition and an appreciation for Scott's achievement: "Nous sortions d'une longue revolution; nous avions l'esprit sain, l'ame serieuse et l'imagination retrempee par le spectacle des grandes choses. Le bon sens, la vigueur et la realite de peinture de sir Walter Scott nous convenaient. Nous 6tions plus dignes de la compren- dre que ses compatriotes; nous l'admirames avec plus de conscience et de chaleur: le succes fut immense" ("T.J.," [Jouffroy], "Litterature. Oeuvres Completes de Sir Walter Scott. le article," Le Globe, November 4, 1826, 188-191). 11 Scott's "visual imagination" has been noted by Ian Jack in Sir Walter Scott. Writers and Their Work, London, 1958, 27-28; and by Lars Hartvert in "Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor.

In a review of Kenilworth, one critic noted ironically that the detailed descriptions of the costumes would permit the novel to function also as a text on sixteenth-century fashions.12 Scott had already sketched the costume, the decor, the composition of the scene; the artist had only to follow his prescription to arrive at an ef- fective work which would be immediately comprehensible to the Salon audience, a work whose impact would be in- creased through its identification with the drama and style of the literary original: 11 est certains romans qui sont en possession de fournir de nombreux sujets a la peinture ... Walter Scott, en France et en Angleterre, a vu mille fois reproduire les descriptions et les personnages de ses livres. On pourrait dire qu'il a trace aux arts comme a la litterature une route nouvelle dans l'histoire. - Avec Walter Scott les artistes pour donner a leur oeuvre une expression juste, une verite vivante, n'ont qu'a suivre le texte ligne par ligne; ils y trouvent, pour ainsi dire, un tableau deja complet qu'il leur suffit de copier exactement. Le costume, la pose, le geste, tout y est marque, prevu et parfaitement d fini.13 This direct translation of subject and style in a popular and accessible medium, however, was not explored until French artists had first experimented with several fashions of depicting material from the novels in pictures that were less ambitious in their attempt to unite literature and art.14 We must first turn our attention to the mammoth col- lected edition of Scott's works that was published by Gosselin between 1822 and 1833. The illustrations to this edition (amounting to eighty-six vignettes, eighty-four il- lustrated title pages, and thirty maps) were primarily designed by Alexandre-Joseph Desenne, assisted by Eugene Lami and the Johannot brothers, and engraved by a large team of English and French engravers.'5 English in- fluence was evident in more than the technical translation of the illustrations; French artists were determined to produce works equivalent in technique and literary dis- tillation to English book illustrations, particularly Robert Smirke's illustrations to Gil Blas.16 If we compare two scenes of escape, from Gil Bias and 12 "Sept pages sont consacries la description de l'appartement d'Amy, et comme il n'introduit jamais un personnage sans d6peindre son costume, son roman serait au besoin un excellent Journal des Modes du XVIe siecle" (J. de P6tigny, "Le Chateau de Kenilworth," Annales de la litterature et des arts, III, April 28, 1821, 143). 13 "Salon de 1837, 6e article," L'Artiste, xIII, 1837, 132. 14 This period saw the beginning of the golden age of illustrated texts, owing at least in part to the enthusiastic interest in anything even remotely related to a novel by Scott. In 1833 La Revue britannique reprinted an article that had appeared earlier in Tait's Magazine, entitled "L'Influence exercee par Walter Scott sur la richesse, la moralith et le bonheur de la societe actuelle" (La Revue Britannique, March, 1833, 69- 83). The author stressed the commercial impetus that his novels had given to Scotland's tourist industry, to theatfical adaptations, and to new styles of interior decor and furnishings influenced by his antiquarian research, etc. 15 The first edition of the Oeuvres complates de Walter Scott, translated by A. J. B. Defauconpret, was published by Gosselin between 1822 and 1829 in sixty volumes in-8vo. A separate edition of forty vignettes from this edition was issued by Gosselin in 1824. The same translation was issued in another edition between 1826 and 1833 in eighty-four volumes in-12vo., which contained two hundred engravings, vignettes, and maps. The illustrations were designed by Alexandre-Joseph Desenne (1785- 1827), who had illustrated the works of Racine, Rousseau, La Fontaine, Voltaire, Molibre, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, and Chateaubriand. Desenne was assisted by Eugene Lami (1800-1890), who worked on an important French guidebook to sites described in Scott's novels, the Vues pittoresques de l'Ecosse, Paris, 1826. Desenne was also assisted by Charles Henri Alfred Johannot (1800-1837) and by Antoine Johannot (1803-1852), who contributed many vignettes to editions of works of fic- tion by writers such as Cooper, Rousseau, and La Fontaine, and historical texts by Barante, Thiers, and Hume, as well as painting Scott themes several times. The vignettes to the Gosselin edition were engraved by Dulompre, Pourvoyeur, L. Prevost, C. Heath, Wedgwood, A. Godefroy, J. R. West, Fauchery, W. Ensom, Sisco, H. Adland, Bishop, Gelke, Goulu, Guyard, Barreau, Derby, P. Adam, Migneret, G. Corbould, Motte, Touze, Frilley, Sixdeniers, and Dandeleux. It should be noted that vignettes, culs-de-lampe and watercolor designs for these illustrated edi- tions were often exhibited in the Salons du Louvre by the engravers. The fact that these commercial works were exhibited in the "Salon des ouvrages de l'art" rather than in the "Salon des ouvrages de l'industrie" reflects the fluid definitions of genres and media during this period. 16 L'Artiste, reviewing the Salon of 1831, in reference to the Johannot brothers' illustrations for the Furne edition of Scott's works, credited Smirke wih inspiring the foundation of an increasingly active and tal- ented French school of book illustration: M., grace a l'atude que vous avez faite de notre roman de Gil Bias, traduit par vous en compositions si brillantes, vous avez pris goit a notre litterature. ... Alfred et Tony Johannot, a leur tour, savent puiser aux sources f condes de Walter-Scott, qui sont aussi de l'histoire; et leur crayon spirituel et facile vient en aide a l'art du typographe et se joue ' pour illustrer, suivant votre expression anglaise, les monumens du genie. ... Depuis vingt-cinq ans, votre pays avait donn6 un essor extraordinaire a la librairie, en associant les arts du dessin au succes de cette branche d'industrie. Alors que la paix rouvrit le continent, l'Europe devint sur-le-champ tributaire de la Grande-Bretagne pour ses splendides editions a illustrations, et il se fit sentir en France une emulation qui sous valut de beaux ouvrages typographiques et chalcographiques" ("Leaves de Conches" [Feuillet de Conches, pseudonym of Felix Sabatier], "3e article sur le Salon de 1831 a M. Robert Smirke," L'Artiste, I, 1831, 223-24). The edition of Gil Blas illustrated by Robert Smirke was published in 1809 in London by Longman in four volumes with twenty-four plates by Smirke, engraved by Armstrong, Fitler, Golding, Neagle, Packer, and Raimbach. The same set of twenty-four plates were used for an edition published in 1822 by Hurst, Robinson &amp; Co. in four volumes, engraved by Romney, C. Rolls, F. Engleheart, C. Pye, Scott, Fox, Warren, and Ran- som. The illustrations were issued in a separate set in 1824 in Paris by Engelmann.

Quentin Durward, we may see more easily how Desenne has imitated Smirke's compositional orientation and, above all, the degree of specific literary dependence. In The Escape of Gil Blas with Donna Mencia (Fig. 1), the two figures are arranged parallel to the picture plane in or- der to emphasize their unimpeded movement. They strain in opposing directions, simultaneously exhibiting fearful hesitancy and bravado. Setting and costumes are not specific; the flowing drapery serves to indicate speed of flight and lines of physical stress, while the rough passageway suggests the perilous situation. In brief, the clarity of the dramatic situation is of supreme importance, so that the description of decor and costumes is generalized in order to highlight the gestures and expres- sions of the characters. In a similar fashion, Desenne's Le Sac du ch&amp;teau from Quentin Durward (Fig. 2) presents us with another lateral composition, in which the youth and maiden simultaneously draw nearer to each other and reveal the strength of the forces seeking to wrench them apart. Isabelle de Croye has taken refuge during the sack of the castle of Schonwaldt (indicated by the clouds of smoke) in an oratory (indicated by a crucifix). Durward has fought his way to her (indicated by the discarded spear and shield at his feet). Despite the considerable stress that Scott placed on the political intrigues leading up to this in- cident, the historical period, and the local mores, Desenne's image is of a passionate encounter of young lovers menaced by unexplained violence or catastrophe, which is wholly comprehensible apart from its specific historical and textual exposition. Diametrically opposed to this presentation of a univer- sal emotion stripped of specific historical allusions was the approach taken by some painters who had profited from a close examination of the earlier "troubadour" works. Although "troubadour" painters often depicted medieval monarchs experiencing ordinary human emotions (the private lives of these rulers, or "l'homme dans les h&amp;ros," as the critic E. F. A. M. Miel had said), their fundamental preoccupation was the meticulous description of the moeurs and costume of past ages.17 An erudite and compe- tent history painter of the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies was advised to depict the selected subject's setting, costume, rituals, etc., with the greatest possible accuracy, in order to arrive at the most effective and instructive representation of a historical action. In the nineteenth cen- tury, this respect for the depiction of moeurs and costume was heightened; it had been considered an aid, but now became the justifying premise of an art work, by virtue of its evocative and instructive presentation of historical truth. The appeal of an art that concentrated on couleur 17 Edme-Francois-Antoine-Marie Miel, Essai sur le Salon de 1817, ou Examen critique des principaux ouvrages dont l'exposition se compose, Paris, 1817, 290. The terms moeurs and costume reflected a concern with far more than visible actions and dress. Millin defined the history paint- er's understanding of costume in the following terms: "... terme par le- quel on entend I'observation exacte de ce qui, suivant le temps, fait reconnaitre le genie, les moeurs, les loix, le goit, les richesses, le caractere et les habitudes d'un pays ou I'on place la scene d'un tableau, d'un bas- relief ou d'un ouvrage dramatique" (A. L. Millin, Dictionnaire des beaux-arts, Paris, 1806, I, 361). Moeurs pertained more directly to dramatic gesture and expression, and were also seen as relating to social behavior, occupation, class, etc., as well as to age and sex. The same views had been expressed earlier by Claude-Henri Watelet and Pierre- Charles Levesque in the Dictionnaire de peinture, sculpture et gravure, Paris, 1792; see "Costume," I, 506 and "Moeurs," in, 487.</page><page sequence="6">SCOTT'S NOVELS AND FRENCH PAINTING 273 locale'1 to the suppression or elimination of significant ac- tions was achieved through a combination of archival familiarity and antiquarian knowledge with sensual ap- peal, so that the painting almost attained the jewel-like brilliance of a manuscript illumination. Furthermore, such an art was guaranteed a wider audience than classical history painting in the traditional mode, since the episodes were self-explanatory (relying as they did on visual effects and sentimental episodes), thus obviating a previous education in the classics. The painters of the 6cole de Lyon had already demonstrated the validity of such an approach to medieval history; it now remained to apply the "troubadour" style to scenes from historical novels with a medieval setting. Scott's meticulous antiquarian descriptions were very useful guides for pictorialization. This was true to such an extent that some paintings and lithographs in the "troubadour" style degenerated into inventories of medieval bric-a-brac. Henri-Joseph Fradelle's The Earl of Leicester's Visit to Amy Robsart (Fig. 3), a painting of 1825 that was engraved and issued in Paris in 1827, ex- presses an intense interest in details of costume and decor, but the significance of the scene is uninterpretable without an intimate knowledge of the textual source.19 This scene from chapter 7 of Kenilworth actually involves a complex of political and emotional intrigues. Leicester, secretly married to Amy Robsart, wears his decorations in order to please his bride. These decorations, however, given to him by Elizabeth I, are in fact symbolic of his ambition to rule England as her consort, which will eventually lead him to murder his wife Amy. The "troubadour" interest in pic- turesque details of couleur locale has been employed but not a simplifying, self-explanatory subject. Decor overwhelms anecdote and mood. Another approach which deemphasized anecdotal ex- position can be termed "extraction": the depiction of a character or a landscape apart from its explications of text and importance. An interesting example of this approach occurred in a major painting by a major artist: Horace Vernet's Allan Mac-Aulay (Fig. 4), exhibited in the Salon of 1824 and immediately purchased by the Duc d'Orleans, later Louis-Philippe.20 Here, it is a character that has been extracted from the text. Allan holds the severed head of one of the Children of the Mist, his hereditary enemies. The scene of his holding this trophy in an orgy of blood lust on a mountainside does not occur in the novel; Scott only describes his placing of the severed head on his un- cle's dinner table before several horrified guests.2' Vernet has transformed an episode that, when visualized in con- crete detail, might have appeared ridiculous. By extracting the ferocious character from the civilized background of a dinner party, and placing him against a stormy Highland 18 The term couleur locale is a significant one in Romantic criticism and aesthetics.

It is possi- ble that this subject, and Vernet's rendition of it, resembling as it does a grisly variant of the theme of Judith with the head of Holofernes, in- fluenced Vernet's later handling of that subject. In a review of the painting Judith avec la tate d'Holoferne, sent from Rome, Etienne Delecluze referred specifically to Scott's impact on the modern form of historical painting: Les chants d'un porte, les compositions d'un peintre, qu'est-ce autre chose qu'un 'cho, qu'une contr'epreuve plus ou moins fiddle de tout ce qui se dit, de tout ce qui se voit autour de nous? ... le pauvre artiste n'est la que le tres-humble employe de son siecle, tenant proces-verbal de tout ce qui passe dans l'esprit de la multitude. ... C'est la faute du public si on lui presente les sujets anciens sur des formes modernes, si les artistes donnent A l'aventure de Judith tout le piquant d'une scene de Walter Scott et les nuances chatoyantes et passionees d'un poeme de Lord Byron. C'est la condition sans laquelle nous ne comprendrions pas, nous ne sentirions pas, nous serions morts" (E.-J. Delecluze, "Beaux-Arts. Exposition du Luxembourg. M. Horace Vernet," L'Artiste, I, 1831, 23). The changing spirit of the age had called for a new form of literature, such as Scott's historical novels, which, in turn, had altered the popular conception of historical painting. One wonders if Vernet's Judith, now lost, had had more in common with Allan Mac-Aulay than an anecdotal approach to a historical theme, and has resembled it in composition or pose.</page><page sequence="7">274 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1981 VOLUME LXIII NUMBER 2 A 3 Engraving by J.

Their praise for Vernet was directed to his mastery of couleur locale, a faculty he shared with Scott: "Les romans de cet ecrivain sont en quelque sorte les reflets de l'histoire; ils se distinguent surtout par la ficondite de l'inspiration, la v6rite des details, I'6nergique peinture des passions; qualit&amp;s qui se retrouvent A un degre d'analogie treis-remarquable dans les brillantes com- positions de M. Horace Vernet."23 But it was inevitable that appreciation of Scott's literary contribution would encourage direct translation of his episodes from page to painting, attempting a genuine narrative in a visual image.

He has not merely illustrated an episode; he has aggrandized a genre painting of peasant mores before a funeral into a classical scene of mourning (reminiscent of Poussin's Death of Germanicus in the lateral grouping and the drapery on the wall), and this heroic presentation is very close in spirit to Scott's verbal description, and to his general approach to social realities in literature.27 Scheffer's selection of this subject for depiction related more to the nature of the complex inter- nal conflicts in the story than to the directly visual aspects, such as dramatic action or expressive gesture, since this passage emphasizes the stoic nature of the family's response. His concentration on aspects such as charac- terization or internal conflict was shared by most art critics, and, one would assume, the general public. The issue of narrative fidelity, as opposed to visual potency, would become increasingly important in the period from 1827 to 1833, which saw a proliferation of artifacts in- spired by Scott's oeuvre. Une vignette n'est autre chose que la miniature d'un grand tableau. Si elle ne demande pas le meme talent d'execution, elle pr6sente absolument les memes difficult6s sous le rapport de la composition, de l'en- tente de la lumiere, et de l'ajustement des figures. La diversite des sujets qu'on est, chaque jour, appele a traiter ... n4cessitent, en outre, une grande flexibilite de talent, et un grand fonds de connaissances acquises sur toutes les parties du ressort de la peinture. Que de vignettes reportees sur la toile, dans d'autres propor- tions, deviendraient des tableaux remarquables, et met- taient en evidence ce principe, combattue par quelques dessinateurs, que la composition est le premier merite dans les beaux-arts.28 The period that saw the production of the greatest quantity of Scott-related paintings also saw artists and critics grappling with the issue of textual fidelity in painting. The majority of artists chose the path of least resistance and greatest audience approval: a simple trans- lation of the textual information, thus tending to blur the distinctions between painting and vignette. For example, Camille Roqueplan's La Dame blanche d'Avenel (Fig. 6), exhibited in the Salon of 1827, depicting the White Lady from The Monastery, is very similar in conception and exe- cution to Richard Westall's illustrative vignette of 1821 (Fig. 7).29 Although Roqueplan's painting is clearly much more sophisticated, with respect to its rendering of light, attention to detailed delineation of form and texture, depth of perspective and expressive impact, its basic approach is that of the illustration. The situation depicted is easily un- derstandable: a basic confrontation between two figures, 24 Ary Scheffer (1795-1858). L'Enterrement du jeune pecheur, sujet tire de L'Antiquaire de Walter Scott was reproduced by Scheffer in lithograph for Engelmann in 1826 as part of the Croquis lithographiques par Scheffer ain6. ler cahier, as was a lithograph after another Scott scene, Sujet tire des Puritains d'Ecosse, from Old Mortality, which had been exhibited for the Societe des Amis des Arts in 1826. Scheffer ex- hibited two paintings of episodes from Scott in Caen in 1846: Robert Bruce. Episode de la retraite de Bruce aux iles Hebrides (Histoire d'Ecosse, Walter Scott) and La Fiancee de Lammermoor. 25 The Antiquary, Chap. 31. 26 Flocon and Aycard commented on the dangers inherent in this ap- proach: "Walter-Scott, avant de tracer cette scene, invoque le genie du peintre anglais Wilkie, et apres il la rend d'une maniere si superieure que je ne crois pas que la peinture puisse y atteindre, parce que le dramatique n'en consiste pas dans une seule scene, mais dans une infinite d'incidens que le romancier ajoute les uns aux autres, et qui serrent le coeur et por- tent ' son comble l'6motion du lecteur" (Ferdinand Flocon and Marie Aycard, Le Salon de 1824, Paris, 1824, 49-50). 27 The fisherman Mucklebackit, forced to mend the same boat in which his son has lost his life, says: "An what would ye have me to do ... unless I wanted to see four children starve because ane is drowned? It's weel wi' you gentles, that can sit in the house wi' handkerchers at your een when ye lose a friend; but the like o' us maun to our wark again, if our hearts were beating as hard as my hammer" (The Antiquary, chap. 34). This realistic, even heroic, depiction of peasants often elicited a comparison with Shakespeare, but perhaps we should see this trait as heralding the beginning of the roman social; see Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, Princeton, N.J., 1973, 473-76. 28 "Maher ...," (Maherault?)

The painting ap- peared in a sale of the effects of the painter Theodore Richard in 1858. Garnier produced a lithograph after the painting in 1828 for Gaugain. The character of the White Lady of Avenel was particularly popular in France in 1827 because of the success of Eugene Scribe's opera-comique La Dame Blanche, which was first performed in 1825. Roqueplan had previously exhibited a paysage historique from Quentin Durward in the Salon of 1824. His other contributions to the Salon of 1827 were also related to Scott: La Mort de l'espion Morris from Rob-Roy (also ex- hibited at the Musee des Beaux-Arts de Lille); La Maree d'equinoxe from The Antiquary (frequently reproduced in lithographs and engravings); and Sujet tire du Monastere from The Monastery. Roqueplan also con- tributed to a suite of eight lithographs relating to Scott themes published by Gaugain in 1829, in collaboration with Achille Dev&amp;ria. Richard Westall's vignette was part of a suite entitled Illustrations to the Monastery: A Romance, engraved by Charles Heath for Hurst, Robinson and Co., London, in 1821. Westall also worked on illustrations to The Lord of the Isles, London, Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown, 1815, and Guy Mannering, London, Hurst, Robinson and Co., 1821.</page><page sequence="9">276 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1981 VOLUME LXIII NUMBER 2 r4-  ' ' , ? : "? t: B ? ? ?~ , ?? i. ' - . s " ... :.a 6 Lithograph by Garnier after Roqueplan, La Dame Blanche, Paris, 1828 (photo: Paris, Bibl.

Scott's description of the scene has been followed in every detail: He arrived ... in a ... deep ravine, which ran down into the valley, and contributed a scanty rivulet to the sup- ply of the brook. A huge rock rose in front, from a cleft of which grew a wild holly-tree, whose dark green branches rustled over the spring which rose beneath. The banks on either side rose so high, and approached each other so closely, that it was only when the sun was at its meridian height, and during the summer solstice, that its rays could reach the bottom of the chasm in which he stood ... the unwonted reflection of the sun was dancing in the pellucid fountain. ... He cast the leathern brogue or buskin from his right foot, planted himself in a firm posture, unsheathed his sword, and ... there stood the figure of a female clothed in white. ... Halbert stood silent and gasped for breath, his hairs erecting themselves on his head - his mouth open - his eyes fixed, and, as the sole remaining sign of his late determined purpose, his sword pointed toward the apparition.30 Although a familiarity with the text is necessary for a full appreciation of all the details of the painting, its basic im- pact is nonetheless intelligible without it. The trend toward increasing dependence on the text, as opposed to pictorial clarity, may be seen in the Johannot vignettes for the Furne edition of the collected works of Scott, published between 1830 and 1832.31 Instead of Desenne's selection of a universally comprehensible emotional conflict or dramatic action, the Johannot brothers tended to select episodes replete with emotional significance, but which could be deciphered only with the assistance of the textual exposition of the subject. In the vignette to La Fiancee de Lammermoor (Fig. 8), for exam- ple, we see a seated maiden presented with a horrifying message of some sort, while the figures around her react with consternation. The actual situation is that Lucy Ashton, secretly betrothed to Edgar Ravenswood, is con- fronted by him with her marriage contract to another: Hardly had Miss Ashton dropped the pen, when the door of the apartment flew open, and the Master of Ravenswood entered the apartment.... He planted him- 30 The Monastery, chaps. 11 and 12. 31 Oeuvres completes de Walter Scott, published by Furne between 1830 and 1832 in thirty-two volumes in-8vo., with thirty vignettes by Antoine and Alfred Johannot, engraved by Blanchard, Courbould, Tavernier, Dandeleux, Pourvoyeur, Dutillois, A. Caron, Cousin, Prudhomme, Koenig, Mauduit, Morizot, Revel, Maulet, Pelke and Lecomte. The suite of thirty watercolors by the Johannot brothers for the vignettes was ac- quired by no less a patron of the arts than the Princesse Marie d'Orlkans; see Marthe Kolb, Une Correspondance inidite de la Princesse Marie d'Orleans Duchesse de Wurtemberg, Paris, 1937, letter 110 (December, 1831) and letter 137 (December 10, 1832) to the Duc de Nemours. The ac- quisition was reported in the Journal des debats on December 20, 1832. The exhibition of these watercolors in the Salon of 1831 elicited praise of an unusually high order from Del6cluze, a generally impassive critic: "Lorsque nous traitons des tableaux d'histoire, nous avons eu plus d'une fois la tentation d'y comprendre les compositions si spirituelles et quel- quefois tres remarquables, que les deux freres MM. Alfred et Tony Johannot, ont peintes d'apres les scenes tirkes des romans de Walter Scott.

His dark-coloured riding cloak, displaced from one shoulder, hung around one side of his person in the am- ple folds of the Spanish mantle. The rest of his rich dress was travel-soil'd, and deranged by hard riding. He had a sword by his side, and pistols in his belt. His slouched hat, which he had not removed at entrance, gave an additional gloom to his dark features which, wasted by sorrow, and marked by the ghastly look com- municated by long illness, added to a countenance naturally somewhat stern and wild, a fierce and even savage expression. The matted and dishevelled locks of hair which escaped from under his hat, together with his fixed and unmoved posture, made his head more resemble that of a marble bust than that of a living man. ... "Is that your handwriting, madam?" he added ... ex- tending towards Miss Ashton her last letter. A faltering "Yes," seemed rather to escape from her lips, than to be uttered as a voluntary answer. "And is this also your handwriting," extending towards her the mutual engagement. Lucy remained silent. Terror, and a yet stronger and more confused feeling, so utterly disturbed her understanding, that she probably scarcely com- prehended the question that was put to her.32 This visual image cannot stand apart from its narrative context. In order to interpret the emotional conflict in the situation we must already be aware of the complicated and tragic history of Lucy and Edgar's star-crossed love, which will culminate in Lucy's insanity, her murder of her im- posed bridegroom and death, and Edgar's suicide. The frozen postures, "ghastly" looks, and lack of comprehen- sion that the vignette represents (with a slightly melodramatic result) are thus critically dependent on the narrative as written by Scott. The term "melodramatic" is not chosen lightly; a description of the mise-en-scene of a theatrical adaptation of The Bride of Lammermoor seems almost designed to ac- company the vignette: "En reculant avec effroi, Lucie est venue jusque sur l'avant-scene, et elle tombe immobile sur le fauteuil qui se trouve en avant de la table. ... Edgard s'avance d'un air sombre, mais calme qui annonce une resolution desesperee ... jusqu'au fauteuil oi Lucie est im- mobile et priv e de raison. I1 la regarde un moment, avec un morne mais tendre desespoir."33 This is not to assert a causal relationship between the play of 1828 and the vignette of 1830, although consciously or unconsciously the theatrical version may have been influential in the design of the illustration.34 But it is clear that such a close accord in the description and design of a fictional episode and its translation into a theatrical scene and a textual il- lustration was possible only through the primacy of what could be termed the expository denominator: the narrative exposition of character and intrigue, and only secondarily its betrayal in gesture and facial expression. This narrative preoccupation, opposed to a concern for self-sufficient pictorial translation, is evident both in many paintings of Scott subjects during this period and in their reception by the critics. One of the most flagrant ex- amples is a work by Pierre-Louis Delaval which was re- jected from the Salon of 1833 (and illustrated in an article in the Journal des artistes protesting its exclusion) and ex- hibited in the Salon of 1834: Julien Peviril partant de l'auberge du Chat Bott6 (Fig. 9).35 The situation is deliberately ambiguous: Julian Peveril bids farewell to the innkeeper's wife and receives her warning to distrust his companion. In order to make her warning understandable to Julian, but prevent its interception by his companion, she embraces him. The critical reaction to the painting was generally favorable, commenting particularly on the "Flemish" perfection of pictorial description. What is sur- 32 The Bride of Lammermoor, chap. 33. 3 La Fiancee de Lammermoor, Act III, scene 6. This three-act piece heroique by Victor Ducange was first performed in 1828 at the Thiatre de la Porte-St.-Martin, and was published in the same year. See Henry Adelbert White, Sir Walter Scott's Novels on the Stage (Yale Studies in English, LXXVI), New Haven and London, 1927, which concentrates on the English and American productions, and Charles Beaumont Wicks, The Parisian Stage. I. 1800-1815, II. 1816-1830 and III. 1831-1850 (University of Alabama Studies, Nos. vi, viii, and xiv), Birmingham, 1950, 1953, 1961. The Romantic period saw an expansion in the impor- tance of the role of the mise-en-scene, and consequently a more lengthy and precise description was included in the published version of the play, frequently specifying gestures as well as setting. Thus it is possible to hypothesize the use of such mises-en-scene as artist's blueprints. See M. A. Allevy, La Mise-en-scene en France dans la premiere moitie du XIXe siecle, Paris, 1938. 34 In addition to the influence of published mises-en-scene, we should also note the presence of lithographs after theatrical sets and costumes in Parisian theatrical adaptations of Scott novels. For example, in 1827 Louis Boulanger designed the costumes to Jean-Marie J. Mdly-Janin's play Louis XI at the Theatre Frangais, adapting Quentin Durward. A suite of lithographs after the costumes was issued by Englemann in the same year. 35 Pierre-Louis Delaval (1790-1868). In a letter of March 2, 1833, Delaval protested the exclusion of the painting from the Salon of 1833, claiming that some members of the jury had told him that they hadn't seen the work at all (Paris, Archives de l'Institut de France 5E23). The Journal des artistes also protested its omission, asserting: "Ces tableaux [a landscape by Pernot and Delaval's Peveril] sont tels qu'il ne se trouvera jamais un membre du jury qui veuille avouer qu'il en a vot6 le rejet" ("Salon de 1833, 7e article," Journal des artistes, I, April 14, 1833, 262-63). The arti- cle was accompanied by a line engraving after the painting by Fremy. When the painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1834, the livret description ran as follows: "A peine debarque en Angleterre, Julien Peveril est environnee par les ennemis de sa famille, et par suite il n'a pu, chez le marchand de chevaux, se procurer qu'un cheval lourd, qui doit ralentir sa marche. Cependant, lorsqu'il est sur le point de se mettre en route, la femme qui tient l'auberge du Chat-Bott&amp;, sous pretexte de lui servir la coupe de vin de l'Ftrier, monte sur un banc, et lui previent qu'il ait ' se mefier de l'homme qui s'est fait volontairement son compagnon de voyage. Julien, qui ne prevoyait pas ce motif, trouvant a sa porthe l'aubergiste, qui avait bonne mine, prend le verre d'une main, passe l'autre sur son epaule et l'embrasse." The episode is taken from chapter 21 of Peveril of the Peak.</page><page sequence="11">278 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1981 VOLUME LXIII NUMBER 2 w  . ...L II ii;r i=,, 8 T.

Nat.) prising, however, is that the subject aroused no surprise, and was even praised as sensitive and well chosen. Landon commented on the work: "A l'inspection du trait joint A cette notice, chacun reconnaltra que la scene est dispos6e de maniere A ce que le personnage soupqonn6 ne puisse pas s'apercevoir qu'on parle de lui, et que ce personnage est bien dans son caractere."36 Thus the artist was praised precisely for selecting a situation that was impossible to put into visually comprehensible terms. The very am- biguity of the scene was one of its chief merits, since it was a false ambiguity for the educated viewer. Once apprised of the plot and the intrigues between the characters, the spectator would take pleasure in recapitulating for himself the series of events leading up to the painted scene which had already been described in the novel, and enjoy the way in which Julian and the innkeeper's wife were able to con- ceal their recognition of Ganless's treachery. Such an approach, in which the spectator almost ignored the pictorial presentation in order to recapture the novelist's description, could prove to be the painter's un- doing, and such was already beginning to be the case at this early date. L6on Cogniet's Rebecca enlevee par le Templier (Fig. 10), exhibited at the Galerie Lebrun in 1829 and in the Salon of 1831, demonstrates this risk.37 Its reception also demonstrates the jeopardy that awaited the literary painter. Jal commented drily: "Rebecca enlev'e par le Templier, realisation verveuse et puissante de la scene poetique de Walter Scott. Tout cela est bien, l'fpisode d'Ivanhoe surtout."38 The Courrier franyais was even more devastating: "Pourquoi M. Cogniet n'a-t-il expos6 rien de capital cette ann6e? Sa Rebecca enlevie par le templier a un succes de vogue. Dans son petit cadre, cette tete admirable s6duit et attache le spectateur.

Rebecca enlevee par le Templier was sold for 7,600 francs in 1834 as part of the collection of Jacques Laffitte. See entry No. 41 in an annotated copy of the catalogue for the sale on December 15, 1834, Bibliotheque du Musee du Louvre. The painting was exhibited in 1846 at the Bazar Bonne Nouvelle, and described as belong- ing to the Marquis of Hertford. After 1857 it passed into the collection of Sir Richard Wallace, in which it still figures (P 279). The dimensions are 90 X 117cm. See Gustave Waagen, The Treasures of Art in Great Britain, London, 1854-1857, supplement No. 86; Catalogue ... Bethnal Green, 7th ed., London, 1873, Cat. No. 345. The scene portrayed by Cogniet oc- curs in chapter 31 of Ivanhoe: One turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from window and shot-hole.... The air was filled with groans and clashing of arms; the floors were slippery with the blood of despairing and ex- piring wretches. ... Rebecca, placed on horseback before one of the Templar's Saracen slaves, was in the midst of the little party; and Bois- Guilbert, notwithstanding the confusion of the bloody fray ... neglecting his own defence, held before her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield. ... The fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of the castle, when Ulrica, who had just kindled it, appeared on a turret, in the guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war- song. ... Her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity, and she brandished the distaff which she held in her hands.

On considering the work itself, we find these critical reactions to be well deserved, unfortunately for Cogniet. The scene is cluttered with pedantic details (such as the Hebrew let- ters on the hem of Rebecca's robe), which distract from the potential impact of the already subdued action and the emotion of what should be a violent scene of carnage and abduction. The basically lateral procession in the foreground of Bois-Guilbert and his cohorts delineates the dramatic situation (Rebecca's abduction from the besieged castle of Torquilstone) while negating the potentially powerful thrust of the riders. Rebecca's face is so calm as to seem apathetic, and her pose does not betray the slightest fear or horror at her plight. The minuscule figures in the background at the left (Richard the Lionheart and his supporters forcing entry into the castle) are incapable of providing either visual interest or narrative elaboration. In sum, although the entire episode is portrayed, none of the various passions of the text are transmitted by the painting. Delacroix was one of the few artists to transcend literary constraints in his depiction of subjects from Scott.40 His Massacre de l'6veque de Liege (Fig. 11), ex- hibited at the Musee Colbert in 1829 and 1830, at the Royal Academy in 1830 and at the Salon du Louvre of 1831, is a superb evocation of the unrestrained passions and fury of William de la Marck, the Wild Boar of the Ar- dennes, contrasted to the Bishop of Liege, who scorns to 39 (N.L.M. Artaud), "Salon de 1831, 4e article," Le Courrier franpais, May 16, 1831. 40 Much has been written on Delacroix's utilization of themes from Scott for several of his major works, but Martin Kemp's is the only tudy of Delacroix's multifaceted and long-standing interest in Scott's style of writing, and his participation in the French literary as well as pictorial response (in reference to Delacroix's costumes for Hugo's play Amy Robsart, of 1828). See Martin Kemp, "'Scott and Delacroix, with Some Assistance from Hugo and Bonington," Scott Bicentenary Essays, ed., Alan Bell, Edinburgh and London, 1973, 213-227. The paintings that Kemp selects for discussion range from small costume pieces (such as the Cromwell dans le chateau de Windsor, Salon of 1831) to the larger, more expressive works (such as the Assassinat de l'v&amp;que de Liege and the Enlkvement de Rebecca). Kemp's forte is his ability to weave together pictorial and literary developments, especially in regard to the statements of Delacroix, Hugo, and Stendhal. He points out that Delacroix's earlier antiquarian interests, centering on picturesque costume and mores, later ceded to an interest in Scott's dramatic expressiveness, present behind a dense web of narrative and decorative detail. He concludes that Delacroix's later use of Scott was less a matter of textual illustration than of inspiration, and mentions the French literary community's admiration for Scott's "pictorial" style. Individual Scott-related paintings by Delacroix have also been studied by Michdle Toupet (see below) and Lee Johnson, in "A Delacroix Recovered: Quentin Durward and Le Balafr," Burlington Magazine, November, 1966, 568-570; and "Some Historical Sketches by Delacroix," Burlington Magazine, October, 1973, 672-76. Delacroix's example influenced the behavior of artists like Poterlet and Saint-Evre, but the majority of artists reacted in more conventional ways, evolving from the example of the icole de Lyon or the Bowyer and Boydell Galleries, as well as illustrative vignettes. For this reason, I have chosen to concentrate on the general trends of artistic development, ex- emplified by such artists as Cogniet, rather than the most innovative or pictorially advanced solutions, as offered by Delacroix.</page><page sequence="13">280 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1981 VOLUME LXIII NUMBER 2 plead for his life and instead lays down the conditions for his captor's penitence.41 Delacroix situates his mob of small and vehemently gesturing figures on a diagonal into depth, illuminated by blazing torches. Despite Scott's precise and lengthy description of the costumes of the ma- jor figures, Delacroix prefers to concentrate on significant gestures and chiaroscuro, in order to produce his dramatic effect.42 L'Artiste referred to it in glowing terms, praising the compositional organization, the decor, the actions of the figures, and the physiognomy of the characters, and compared its effect to that of a grande machine by Leonardo or Rubens.43 Delacroix's achievement, to be sure, included far more than a simple representation of a literary episode. He suc- ceeded in transforming emotional and dramatic elements from a literary text into purely visual terms. But his brilliant response to the issue of literary art in this period was an isolated landmark. Far more common were efforts at expository pictorialization that artists such as Cogniet were producing. Delacroix's example, however, was in- fluential in encouraging artists to concentrate on pictorial concerns of composition and chiaroscuro, rather than tex- tual description. In doing so, artists began to effect a blend or alloy of artistic genres and media. Roqueplan's La Maree d'equinoxe (Fig. 12), a painting exhibited in the Salon of 1827 and generally discussed as a genre painting of a literary subject, was also called a marine historide because of the expanded role that the seascape played in determining the mood of the work as well as its ap- pearance.44 The blindingly white foam dazzles us as it crashes against the towering crags, setting off the stranded figures of Sir Arthur Wardour, his daughter Isabella, and the beggar Edie Ochiltree. The situation is immediately ac- cessible, even without reference to the novel, the Salon livret, or the legend at the bottom of the lithograph by Garnier after the painting, but critical praise nevertheless devolved on the situation's literary rather than visual aspects: "... M. Roqueplan a l'avantage d'offrir dans son tableau une grande et attachante pensee. Son sujet, du au genie fertile de Walter Scott, montre le rang et la fortune, l'abaissement et la misere, la grAce, la beaut&amp;, les trois Ages principaux de la vie, en presence d'une mort inevitable. Nos fortunes seront bient6t gales, dit le mendiant &amp;cossais. Cette phrase vaut seule un traite de philosophie, et le tableau de M. Roqueplan a le meme m&amp;rite."45 An even more complex amalgamation of landscape and 41 Ferdinand-Victor-Eugene Delacroix (1798-1863): Alfred Robaut, L'Oeuvre Complet d'Eugene Delacroix, Paris, 1885, 81, Cat.

The Massacre de el'v&amp;que de Liege was exhibited at the Mus&amp;e Colbert in December, 1829 and February, 1830, and at the Royal Academy in 1830 under the title The Boar of the Ardennes. Its title when exhibited in the Salon du Louvre of 1831 was Guillaume de la Marck surnomm' le Sanglier des Ardennes. It was also exhibited in the Exposi- tion Universelle of 1855. Its provenance is as follows: painted for the Duc d'Orleans in 1829 (1,500 francs); sold by the Duchesse d'Orleans January 18, 1853 (lot 17, 4,800 francs) to F. Villot; sold by Villot, February 11, 1865 (lot 1, 35,000 francs); bought back by Villot; sold August 19, 1866 to P. Durand-Ruel for 33,000 francs; sold by Durand- Ruel to Khalil Bey for 39,000 francs; sold by Khalil Bey January 16, 1868 (lot 17 for 46,000 francs) and bought back by Durand-Ruel; sold by Durand-Ruel April 1868 to F. Petit for Mme. de Cassin for 50,000 francs; sold by Landolfo Carcano (formerly the collection of Mme. de Cassin) May 30, 1912 (lot 23); sold to Tauber; Salavin Collection; acquired by the Musee du Louvre 1961-13. For an excellent study of the painting, see Michdle Toupet, "L'Assassinat de l'Eveque de Liege par Eugene Delacroix," Revue du Louvre, 1963, 83-94. The episode of the murder of Louis of Bourbon, Bishop of Liege, occurs in chapter 22 of Quentin Durward. 42 Despite his deliberate omission of textual details regarding the costume and setting in his rendition of the subject, Delacroix was deeply in- terested in Scott's literary achievement, as witnessed by his two un- published novellas whose plots bear more than a passing resemblance to novels by Scott. "Alfred" deals with the invasion of Normandy by William the Conqueror (the period antedating the Saxon and Norman conflicts in Ivanhoe). "Les Dangers de la cour" follows the adventures of a Swiss secretary to a gentleman at the court of Sardinia, and recalls the plot of Quentin Durward, which follows the career of a Scots archer at the court of Louis XI of France. See Jean Marchand, "Eugene Delacroix. Homme de lettres d'apres trois oeuvres de jeunesse inedites," Le Livre et l'estampe, xix, 1953, non-paginated extract of eleven pages. 43 "Quant l'aveque de Liege, je defie qu'on trouve dans toute l'histoire de la peinture une composition plus energique et plus pleine.... les lignes generales, la profondeur, le ton vieilli des boiseries sculptees, l'orgie et le sang ... la demarche grave et resign&amp;e au prelat, et au bout de la table, le demon qui domine cet enfer, le sanglier, les yeux h'b6t's, le regard plein de vin et de sommeil, essayant de ressaisir les restes de sa raison fugitive pour commander un dernier meurtre. ... Execute sur une toile de vingt pieds, L'Ev4que de Liege serait bien place entre La Cane de Leonard et Le Jugement dernier de Rubens" ("Litterature. Portraits et caracteres con- temporains. IV. Eugene Delacroix," L'Artiste, II, 1831, 180). 44 Roqueplan's La Marie d'equinoxe, depicting a scene from chapter 7 of The Antiquary, was reproduced in lithograph by Phileas-Salvator Levilly (exhibited in the Salon of 1833) and by Hippolyte-Louis Garnier (ex- hibited in La Gymnase des Beaux-Arts in 1829 and in the Salon of 1831), and in engraving by Antoine-Fran;ois Gelke (exhibited in the Salon of 1831 and by the Societe des Amis des Arts in 1831). The exhibition, as well as the dissemination, of these graphic reproductions of literary paintings was likely to have intensified the critics' tendency to discuss a painting's literary subject, rather than its pictorial execution. The livret for the Salon of 1827 described the painting as belonging to the Duke of Fitz-James. La France chretienne discussed the painting as a marine historiee: "Sa Marie d'equinoxe, oil l'on a plaisir de retrouver les person- nages avec lesquels nous avons fait connaissance dans l'Antiquaire de Walter Scott offre vraiment l'int&amp;ret d'un tableau. M. Roqueplan peut en cela servir de moddle a ses confreres les peintres de marine qui se conten- tent souvent de representer une c6te nue et une barque sur l'eau. Il ne suffit pas que vous captiviez ma vue par le merite de l'imitation ou le merite de la difficult4 vaincue; celui qui manie le pinceau est un poete; comme tel, j'ai le droit de lui demander qu'il parle a mon Ame, qu'il la remue, qu'il m'int'resse" ("Salon de 1827, 6e article.

We may judge the constraints on the paint- er's freedom to deviate from the text if we turn to another critic's response to the same painting. After noting the passion and realism of the scene, the generally fresh and effective rendering of the seascape and figures, he continued: "Pourquoi M. Roqueplan a-t-il craint de donner a la jeune fille une robe blanche, ainsi que l'indiquait Walter-Scott? Avait- il donc besoin de cette robe rouge, qui nuit d'ailleurs a l'effet, pour faire detacher le corps de jeune fille sur un fond de mer &amp;cumeux?"

Nantes, Mus&amp;e des Beaux-Arts (photo: Mus&amp;e) literature occurred in Prosper Barbot's La Foret de Woodstock (Fig. 13), exhibited in the Salon of 1833.46 Although it was exhibited as a landscape, it was accom- panied by a livret description that made it clear that the physical appearance of the landscape was of less impor- tance than the actions of the staffage.47 Despite the critics' lack of appreciation, Barbot accomplishes a very subtle blending of the genres of landscape and literary genre painting, thanks in part to a careful reading of the original text, which contained a full and evocative passage in which anthropomorphic symbolism heightened the scene's tension: "... Doctor Rochecliffe and ... Alice... stopped when they had attained a station under the cop- pice, and shrouded by it, from which they could see all that passed on the little esplanade before the King's Oak, whose broad and scathed form, contorted and shattered limbs and frowning brow, made it appear like some an- cient warworn champion, well selected to be the umpire of a field of single combat."48 In Barbot's painting, the landscape, towering over the miniature figures, assumes the major responsibility for emotional suggestion, through the use of writhing trunks and blighted branches. But despite the sensitive transformation of literary actions and mood into such natural phenomena as foliage and shadows, and such visual concerns as composition and brushwork, the painting was still received as a literary rather than pictorial exercise. It would seem, therefore, that the years between 1827 and 1833 saw a primarily narrative emphasis in the pic- torial exploration of Scott by French artists. Even if they were not engaged in genuine illustration, their efforts tended to emphasize literary issues of characterization, ex- position, and successive actions. Even if this was not the case, their critics would recapitulate these literary compo- nents while ignoring the artists' handling of purely visual or technical matters. This frustrating situation soon reached a crisis point. Nos artistes ont le grand tort de s'inspirer trop rarement des chefs-d'oeuvres litteraires des romanciers, des historiens et des poetes. ... Quand on a dit que la po6sie 6tait une peinture, on a dit vrai, en ce sens que le porte est souvent aussi heureux A grouper ses h&amp;ros, A dis- poser ses personnages, A meubler le lieu de la scene, A l'eclairer du jour convenable, que peut tre le peintre le plus habile. ...

Chacune de leurs pages est un tableau tout fait qu'on n'a qu'a reproduire; mais, au nom de ciel! pourquoi ne les reproduit-on pas?49 In spite of the exhortations of L'Artiste, many artists reacted to the conflict between literary and visual demands by turning to other pictorial subjects. The number of Scott-related paintings declined in these years, but some artists continued along the lines indicated by artists in the 1820's. The "troubadour" enthusiasm for medieval couleur locale, present before the rise of Scott's aegis but given a new sense of historical validity by his achieve- ment, had already encouraged the production of such works as Fradelle's, but in the 1830's the link between Scott's antiquarian interests and "troubadour" romances was made explicit. We may see this in a comparison be- tween Deveria's Elisabeth ' Greenwich (Fig. 14), a lithograph from a suite of scenes from Kenilworth issued in 1837, and Fleury-Frangois Richard's Francois ler et Marguerite de Navarre (Fig. 15), a "troubadour" painting first exhibited in the Salon of 1804.50 The relationship is more than a matter of decorative inventory and com- positional arrangement. Both anecdotes deal with poems engraved on a windowpane: Fran;ois I muses on the capriciousness of women, Elizabeth I warns Raleigh that only the brave deserve the fair.5' Thus the two works share a common conceit: that of permitting a verbal allu- sion in a visual image. Whereas Richard's painting relied on his audience's familiarity with national historical legends in order for them to appreciate the scene, Dev6ria could confidently expect his viewers to have been educated by Walter Scott.52 The fading of distinctions between literary painting and illustration, first seen in the 1820's, continued during this period. The quotation of English illustrations, such as those by Smirke and Westall, which had also been seen earlier, also continued. Edouard Cibot's Lucie Ashton et lord Ravenswood (Fig. 16), exhibited in the Salon of 1840, 9 "Le Vicaire de Wakefield," L'Artiste, vii, 1834, 240-41. 5o Achille-Jacques-Jean-Marie Dev&amp;ria (1800-1857) studied painting with Girodet and illustration with Laffitte. He produced paintings, engrav- ings, lithographs, and illustrations for three hundred works. He produced many lithographs relating to Scott novels, including a suite of eight scenes from his novels and poems in collaboration with Roqueplan for Gaugain in 1829, and a group of three scenes from Woodstock for Ledoyen in 1835. The suite of six lithographs from Kenilworth was issued by Bulla in 1837. Fleury-Franqois Richard (1777-1852) exhibited his painting of FranCois ler et Marguerite de Navarre in the Salons of 1804 and 1814. The engraving by Desnoyers was exhibited in the Salon of 1817 under the title Souvent femme varie, bien fol est qui s'y fie. It also appeared in Reveil's Musee de peinture, iv, 1830, 605. 51 Raleigh had carved on the windowpane the following sentence: "Fain would I climb, but that I fear to fall." Elizabeth completed it with the following bon mot: "If thy mind fail thee, do not climb at all" (Kenilworth, chap. 17). The poem engraved on the window by Franqois I served as the title of the Desnoyers engraving. 52 The almost universal knowledge of Scott's characters and plot in- trigues permitted many Salon paintings to receive such laconic titles as Sujet tire de Walter Scott (Pierre-Adolph Badin, Salon of 1838) or Paysage de Scott (Alexis-Francois Boyenval, Salon of 1831).</page><page sequence="16">SCOTT'S NOVELS AND FRENCH PAINTING 283 4r?l oil..

Nat.) is very similar to Thomas Stothard's illustration to the novel of twenty years before (Fig. 17).53 They resemble each other in composition, gesture, and setting, but par- ticularly in the selection of the moment. This scene foreshadows the doom of the house of Ravenswood through Lucy's brother's shooting of a raven; the bloodstains on Lucy's dress anticipate her murder of her bridegroom. Once more the situation is such that the spec- tator is forced to rely on the literary exposition of the con- flict, rather than the immediate visual data, in order to ap- preciate the true character of the scene. What are we to make of the dead bird, cause of the horror and disdain ex- hibited by Lucy and Edgar, if we are not already versed in the novel's gloomy prophecies of catastrophe for the lovers and its frequent, pointed symbols? Both painting and vignette depend on the text, and although the painting is more self-sufficient, its greatest impact is still narrative rather than pictorial. The final stage of this fraternal relationship between painting and illustration was the creation of historical paintings for the purpose of dissemination as paired lithographs. The Johannot brothers exhibited Salon paintings in 1836 and 1840 of historical scenes from two Scott novels which were similar in subject, style, composi- tion, and textual source, and which were engraved and issued as pendants in 1842.54 Marie Stuart quitte l'Ecosse (Fig. 18) by Tony Johannot, exhibited in 1836, depicts the last scene of the novel The Abbot. Mary Stuart, forced to abdicate her throne and flee from captivity at Lochleven, bids farewell to her partisans before her departure for the court of Elizabeth I and, unwittingly, her future execution. The queen stands proudly against the gloomy seascape, forming the apex of a triangular arrangement of figures. L'Embarquement d'Elisabeth a Kenilworth (Fig. 19), 53 FranCois-Barthelemy-Michel-Edouard Cibot (1799-1877) studied with Guerin and Picot, exhibiting historical scenes, genre paintings, and por- traits in the Salons between 1827 and 1877. Lucie Ashton et lord Ravenswood had been exhibited in Mulhouse in 1839, before its inclu- sion in the Salon du Louvre of 1840. It was reproduced in L'Artiste, v, 1840, 252, in a lithograph by Lassalle entitled La Fiancee de Lammermoor. Cibot had exhibited another Scott painting in Douai in 1829: Waverly tombe en exstase en entendant Maclwor improviser sur sa harpe, described as a plagiarism of Corinne (presumably the version by G6rard) ("Exposition de Douai," L'Observateur des beaux-arts, August 9, 1829). 54 The livret entries for the two paintings ran as follows: "Marie Stuart quitte l'Ecosse. Le Sherif d'Angleterre offrit la main a la reine; elle 6tait deja sur le pont volant par oui elle devrait entrer dans l'esquif, quand l'abbe qui l'avait suivie sans cesse en qualite d'homme d'armes, s'd1ance dans l'eau et saisit Marie par la robe en s'6criant: "Princesse aveugle et trompee, vous etes perdue si vous quittez ce rivage. Non, reine d'Ecosse, vous n'abandonnez pas ainsi notre heritage." La reine se retourna d'un air bienveillant en lui disant: "Abbe, vous voyez que c'est de notre pleine volonte que nous quittons ce royaume." De la, elle passa en Angleterre, oii elle fut malgre toutes les promesses d'Elisabeth, jug&amp;e, imprisonn6e et decapit&amp;e." The scene occurs in chapter 38 of The Abbot. And again from the livret: "L'Embarquement d'Elisabeth a Kenilworth. Walter Raleigh etend son manteau sur les marches rendues glissantes par la pluie. (Walter Scott, Le Chateau de Kenilworth). (Ce tableau, compose par feu Alfred Johannot, a etA peint par son frere Tony Johannot.)" The scene occurs in chapter 15 of Kenilworth. The pendant engravings by Girard were issued by Bulla and Delarue in 1842. The following paintings of Scott themes were exhibited by the Johannot brothers: Societe des Amis des Arts, 1829: Sujet tire de Charles-le- Temiraire by Alfred Johannot from Scott's Anne of Geierstein and Sujet tire de la Jolie Fille de Perth by Tony Johannot; Salon of 1833: Minna et Brenda sur le bord du mer by Tony Johannot from The Pirate; at Lille in 1834: Rob- Roy and Peveril du Pic by Alfred Johannot; Salon of 1835: Une Jeune Femme qui chantait une chanson presentant Douglas-le-Noir comme la terreur des enfans, se retourne et le voit aupres d'elle by Tony Johannot from Scott's Tales of a Grandfather; Salon of 1839: La Mort de Julien Avenel by Tony Johannot from The Monastery.</page><page sequence="17">284 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1981 VOLUME LXIII NUMBER 2 designed by Alfred Johannot but completed by Tony Johannot, and exhibited in the Salon of 1840, also depicts a queen who stands at the apex of a triangle of figures in the foreground, ready to step on board a boat, but here the scene is one of sumptuous display and amorous intrigue. Through his gallant action, Walter Raleigh persuades the Queen, previously inclined toward the Earl of Sussex and his followers, to favor the Earl of Leicester. In this way he innocently fans the flames of Leicester's ambitions, and prepares the way for the murder of Leicester's wife. Thus both scenes allude to future tragedy: the one of Mary Stuart at the hands of her cousin Elizabeth, the other of Elizabeth's innocent rival Amy Robsart. Both paintings depict situations that combine historical facts and fictional characters and narratives, blending the subject matter and mood of peinture de genre and peinture d'histoire, as one critic commented: "Marie Stuart quittant l'Ecosse (1039), par M. Alfred Johannot, est a la fois un tableau de genre, d'histoire et de marine; mais dans quel- que categorie qu'on le range ce sera toujours une des plus charmantes et des plus parfaites compositions due au talent si fin et si gracieux de M. Alfred Johannot."-55 In utilizing an approach that presents a sentimental anecdote with an antiquarian's love of correct costume and ac- cessories, the Johannot brothers had selected a pictorial method analogous to Scott's literary form of the historical novel. But in producing such pendant lithographs, which clearly owed their choice of subjects and style to an in- tended graphic dissemination, they had also asserted that Salon historical paintings and literary prints were similar in appearance and intent. One could assume from this that the ultimate apotheosis of the Salon painting was to be sought in graphic reproduction, which tended to highlight the literary subject.56 When critics turned to consider the effects of literature on the visual arts, they were often disturbed by the resul- tant blurring of genre definitions, the translation from a verbal medium to a visual medium without proper respect for the potentials and limitations of each, and the reproduction of historical paintings in graphic media without thought for the way in which the format should have influenced the original image. Louis Peisse laid the burden of these artistic problems squarely on the shoulders of Walter Scott: Walter-Scott a inventh le roman historique, qui a engendrb l'histoire romanesque ou pittoresque si fort en vogue sous la restauration. ...

This state of affairs is made clear if we consider the critical reception of Delacroix's L'Enlevement de Rebecca, which appeared in the Salon of 1846.58 His fidelity to the expressive content of a literary episode, rather than to the external data of the text, was praised by Champfleury as a salutory contrast to the example of Ary Scheffer, the "peintre-litterateur."59 In general, the critics responded to Delacroix's work in two ways, both centering on visual concerns: praise for the brilliant color and energetic move- ment of the work, or complaint about its lack of figural delineation, its general confusion and ill-defined composi- tion, redolent of a preliminary ebauche.6o Paul Mantz, in an article devoted to "Le Salon des coloristes," praised the effective rendering of the disorder, passion, and violence of the episode from Ivanhoe: L'Enlevement de Rebecca est au contraire une scene de mouvement le plus energique. Le corps de la belle Juive, merveilleux de souplesse et d'abandon, est d'une extreme finesse de couleur; le chevalier du second plan qui arrive au grand galop, est d'une allure terrible; le chateau de Frondeboeuf se dresse sur le roc en affectant des perspectives charg6s et grandioses; le vent passe dans la criniere du cheval de l'esclave et la fait flotter en desordre; et en voyant dans le fond ces guerriers qui s'6gorgent et ces lueurs d'incendie, on croit entendre les clameurs des mourans et le craquement des pouitres embrassees.61 Gustave Planche's views were representative of those of the latter group of critics: On ne peut nier que ces deux Africains ne respirent une energie farouche, une impitoyable cruaute; mais les membres, les corps et le visage de ces deux esclaves sont a peine indiques. Ce cheval sur lequel Rebecca va etre plac&amp;e n'est pas en proportion avec le cavalier. Le visage de Rebecca est dessin&amp;, ou plut6t indiqu&amp;, avec tant de confusion, qu'il ne peut exprimer ni la terreur ni la priere. Quant au corps, il n'est pas possible de le deviner sous la vetement. Non-seulement cette composition n'est pas peinte dans l'acception serieuse du mot, mais elle n'est pas meme trouvee. Si M. Delacroix a voulu nous montrer comme il s'y prend pour chercher une composition, comment il t tonne avec son pinceau, a la bonne heure. S'il a cru nous montrer un tableau achev6, nous devons lui dire qu'il s'est complktement trompe.62 In contrast to Cogniet's lateral composition (Fig. 10), Delacroix juxtaposes foreground and background (Fig. 20). Bois-Guilbert's horse dashes out in a diagonal toward the left, while the gestures and orientation of the slaves and Bois-Guilbert himself draw us diagonally back toward s7 Louis Peisse, "Salon de 1834. 5e article," Le National, March 17, 1834. The same accusation that literature had distorted modern painting was leveled a few years later by another critic: C'est un malheur pour les peintres de notre 6poque, et surtout pour les peintres franCais, que leurs rapports intimes avec les gens de lettres. Mais le moyen qu'il en soit autrement? Maintenant qu'il n'y a plus de grands seigneurs, les gens de lettres sont, pour les artistes, des miecnes, des juges, des conseillers. On n'en peut douter a voir la ten- dance toute dramatique de la nouvelle &amp;cole. Le dramatique est ce que les gens de lettres comprennent le mieux dans les arts et le public aussi. Aujourd'hui on appelle un sujet heureux celui qui fait voyager l'imagination du spectateur sur toute la serie des 6v6nemens qui out pr6c6d6 ou qui suivent celui qu'on met sous sex yeux. C'est un drame tout entier, qu'on lui raconte, non une scene d6tach6e et complkte. Dans ce systeme, la peinture n'est, a vrai dire, que de la litterature transformee" ("Salon de 1839," La Revue des deux mondes, 4e ser., xviii, 1839, 88). 5s The title as given in the Salon livret was Rebecca enlevee par les ordres du templier Boisguilbert, au milieu du sac du chateau de Front-de-boeuf (A.

New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, 1903, The Wolfe Fund (photo: Museum) the right, to the scene of battle in the middle ground. The unconscious Rebecca hangs, as if impaled, between two whirlpools of action and interest. By its very "confusion" of direction, nervous line, violent contrapposto, and smoke-blurred forms, the painting is faithful to the basic theme of the text, which is the horrible combat, permeated by blood, fire, hatred, insanity, and lust. In the 1840's and 1850's, the French finally paid Scott the compliment of considering his work seriously and ob- jectively. Instead of eulogies and panegyrics, wild hyper- boles and assertive superlatives, his huge oeuvre of historical writing, fiction, poetry, and literary criticism was examined, assessed, and assimilated into the common body of knowledge. It was now accepted that his descrip- tions could degenerate into lengthy digressions, and that his interests were aroused more readily by quaint super- ficialities than by moving causes. But generally the verdict was a positive one: Scott's gift for describing couleur locale was still perceived as a basic quality in both his fic- tional and factual literature, and his works were still ad- mired for their evocative power and accurate documenta- tion.63 Thus we find that after 1847, when the number of Scott-related paintings submitted to Parisian and provin- cial Salons was dwindling, the nonfictional works of Scott contributed an increasing proportion of subjects.64 Indeed, Scott was cited at times as a historical source for a painting even if he had not furnished the subject of the particular episode in question.65 The same admiration and cautious assimilation that were expressed in literary criticism applied to the visual translation of his works. Although fear of trivializing pic- torial genres into illustrative vignettes or pendant lithographs caused a decline in the number of Scott- related works, the Parisian and provincial Salons still in- cluded a number of such paintings. Henri Pottin's Lady Catherine Douglas se faisant briser le bras pour sauver le roi Jacques ler (Fig. 21), exhibited in the Salon of 1852 as a tableau d'histoire commissioned by the government, may serve as evidence of the respectful assimilation of Scott into the French repertory of historical literature.66 The painting describes an episode from Scott's Tales of 63 See, for example, Parisot's entry for the Biographie universelle, written in 1847: II y aurait mauvais foi et l'on aurait mauvais grace a lui refuser, outre des connaissances historiques tres-variees et tres-profondes, quoique irreguli'res peut-&amp;tre et incompletes, sauf pour les annales de son pays, plusieurs de belles qualit6s de l'historien, la penetration, le d6sir du vrai, la recherche des causes et des ressorts au feu desquels sont dus les evenements, et enfin du talent pour conter et pour d6crire. Sa po6sie est pleine de grace et de facilit6 ... ses recits ont de l'animation ... archaismes et style moderne, vieux tons gris feodal et nuances dix- neuvieme siecle s'y marient, ou s'opposent ... De tout cela cependant ne sort ni grande poesie, ni grande histoire, ni haute critique, ni science complete. (Jacques-Theodore Parisot, "Sir Walter Scott," in Biographie universlle ancienne et moderne. Supplement, ed. Louis- Gabriel Michaud, Paris, 1811-1862, LXXXI, 1847, 501-02). 64 Between 1847 and 1855 the number of Scott-related works varied be- tween one and six per year. In the Salon of 1852, two of the three paintings of subjects from Scott's works were taken from nonfictional sources: Louis Coulon's Sterne (from Scott's biography of Laurence Sterne) and Henri Pottin's Lady Catherine Douglas. 65 Alfred de Dreux's Bataille de Baug6, for example, exhibited in the Salon of 1839, cited Anquetil, Barante, and Walter Scott as historical sources. FranCois-Alexandre Pernot's Vue de la cascade d'Inversnaid, sur les bords du lac Lomond, en Ecosse, exhibited in the Salon of 1845, was accompanied by the following livret description: "C'est au-dessus de cette cascade, plus pres de 1'extr6mite occidentale du lac, et au pied du Ben Lomond, qu'est la caverne de Rob-Roy (Mac-Gregor). On croit qu'elle a ete aussi la refuge d'un prince malheureux; car on lit sur un rocher le nom de Charles Edouard. (Voir Waverly et Rob-Roy, par sir Walter Scott)," thus demonstrating that the landscape in question was not meant to depict a specific episode from a novel, but rather to refer the reader to the history of Scotland, couleur locale, and landscape descrip- tions contained in a number of Scott's works. 66 Louis Aime Henri Pottin (1820-1864) studied historical painting with Picot and engraving with Tony Johannot. Lady Catherine Douglas was commissioned by the Ministre de l'Instruction Publique on January 29, 1850 (Paris, Archives Nationales FZ1 50). Eugene Jazet was granted per- mission to engrave the work on June 10, 1852; the engraving, entitled Devouement de Lady Catherine Douglas, was issued by Delarue in 1853. The painting was sent to the Musee des Beaux-Arts de Caen in 1854 (Paris, Archives Nationales F2P 4500). On December 22, 1856 another Scott-related painted was commissioned for the same price as the first, 1,500 francs: Une scene de jalousie de la reine Elisabeth (Chateau de Kenilworth) (Paris, Archives Nationales F2B 104). It was exhibited in the Salon of 1857, and sent in the same year to the Mus&amp;e des Beaux-Arts de Poitiers (Paris, Archives Nationales Fp1 4500).</page><page sequence="20">SCOTT'S NOVELS AND FRENCH PAINTING 287 a Grandfather, an anecdotal history of Scotland.67 In this carefully composed work, the significance of the action is established by the continuous line that flows through the hasps on the door, Catherine's finger, and the kneeling lady-in-waiting to the recoiling James I. The disparate moods of the characters betrayed by effective and graceful gestures, the careful balance of decorative elaboration and shadowy space (which gives the setting a threatening presence, while preventing it from dominating the figures), the historical importance of the event, and above all, the impact on the viewer of the physical action and psychological conflict combine to make Pottin's painting a successful compromise between peinture d'histoire and peinture de genre. Furthermore, its clear presentation of the textual material, without literary subservience, demonstrates a rare mastery of the opposing impulses toward the creation of narration and visual imagery. By 1852 the time was long past when small genre paintings of literary subjects would be praised for their union of the sister arts of poetry and painting, or when the commercial viability of such works when transformed into graphic ornaments constituted sufficient cause for critical celebration. Perhaps the very enthusiasm for such literary works and their visual offspring during the 1820's and 1830's was partly responsible for a cool reception in the 1840's. Certainly knowledge of the dangers that attended an overly faithful reproduction of a literary text in painting could only be attained after repeated and varied attempts at transforming such texts into pictorial images, and through the comparison of such images with avowed illustrative vignettes and with graphic works that were primarily exercises in literary exposition. But Scott's legacy to French artists was not just a negative one. In addition to the wide thematic repertoire he offered, which could be exploited in superb paintings by such artists as Delacroix, his stimulating approach to history became a permanent part of the French concept of historical process. Informed with couleur locale, assessing historical development as a process of social and ethnic conflict and assimilation, French historical painting had benefited greatly from Scott's oeuvre. Never again would a painter of historical scenes be satisfied with a generalized rr tF A~I e Aij,, -AAA A- 21 Engraving by E.

Thackeray, on seeing the Salon of 1840, remarked with humor and a great deal of truth on this new order: Walter Scott, from his Castle of Abbotsford, sent out a troop of gallant young Scotch adventurers, merry out- laws, valiant knights, and savage Highlanders who, with trunk hosen and buff jerkins, fierce two-handed swords and harness on their back, did challenge, combat and overcome the heroes and demigods of Greece and Rome.
