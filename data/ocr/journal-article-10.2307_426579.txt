The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms* BY MAX RIESER Levels of Awareness IrS the statement that a thing is beautiful or ugly qualita- tively on the same level as the assertion that a thing is hot or cold, sour or sweet? Is aesthetic response a sensuous re- sponse as it may readily seem, or is it an epiphenomenon in- volving thought processes? It is clear why a man is pleasurably affected by coolness or the prospect of a profit, but it is less clear why a certain arrangement of trees or the color of leaves should influence anybody's actions or move him to sacrifices. While the pleasurable effect of a cool wind is sensual and un- mediated by thought, the pleasure of an anticipated profit is ob- viously so mediated, yet the outcome may be a feeling of joy. But the latter arises on another, a higher level of awareness than the pleasure of warm or cool. A similar problem confronts us with respect to aesthetic pleasure. Is the latter on the same level of awareness as our sensuous pleasures? Is it perceptual and imme- diate or conceptual, mediated by thoughts? Assuming that the aes- thetic response to a certain shape or color or object is due to the material fact of its being square or round, pink or white, we shall be confronted necessarily by the additional question: What ground of emotion lies in the mere fact of squareness or roundness? Where is the emotional link between the perception of roundness or squareness and our sensibility as to cause an emotional response? Darwin attributes a sense of beauty to birds which are supposed to appreciate the glowing colors and the elaborate patterns of their plumage. Why do they not appreciate a row of columns or the rosette of a church facade? Are they able to grasp a pattern? *This paper was read at the 41st annual meeting of the American Philosophical Association at Vassar College, December 30th, 1941.</page><page sequence="2">Max Rieser its meaning? The assertion that animals are moved by music pro- ceeds along the same lines of reasoning, namely the tacit assump- tion that aesthetic response is of perceptual not of conceptual origin. It is furthermore implicitly based on a theory that aesthe- tic response arises not on a higher, but on the same level of aware- ness as our pleasure derived from the affection of vision by a lumi- nous source. In my opinion this is a confusion of levels. Do we think nothing when we assert that a thing is beautiful or ugly? Is it not really a conclusion based, as it were, on an investigation? a critical examination of a whole range of relations during which we seem to apply some preconceived standard? If it is mere per- ceptual pleasure, then we could derive it best from shapes in a manual of geometry, or from color samples on a color card. But these elements are only in a slight degree productive of aesthetic response. The latter's intensity increases incomparably when we contemplate objects, edifices, flowers, men within contexts; in other words very complicated and meaningful structures. Mere perceptual elements like circles or patches of color are compara- tively poor in meaning and in aesthetic response. We enjoy rather a "white rose" than "white", a "smooth hand" rather than "smooth- ness" and reject a smooth (bald) head. If the pleasure described as aesthetic is of perceptual origin, why don't we enjoy bald heads and hairy hands? If we exclude meaning from this complex, then whiteness and roundness might be enjoyed as such, and in conse- quence round backs would be as good as round faces or yellow faces as good as yellow flowers. But this is not so. We seem to know ab ovo how faces "ought" to look or backs to be built and judge accordingly. Even if such knowledge were founded on an illusion, it would still be "knowledge", not perception. Acts of Interpretation. The whole aspect changes if we assume that we like not the form, but what it represents and means, or is supposed to repre- sent. Then form is not a dead writ, an inexplicable stimulus to vision or hearing, but a receptacle of some meaning, its outer shell. The aesthetic emotion would thus be linked to an act of inter- pretation, namely an additional interpretation grafted, as it were, 59</page><page sequence="3">60 The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms on the general interpretation we are making whenever confronted with an object. The form of a man for instance, is to us not a mere congeries of eyes, ears, etc., we interpret it instantly as a shell of a spiritual content, namely of a being akin to ourselves. We do not take things at their face values but as representation. But when plunged into the aesthetic mood, we discern in these forms something additional; the form speaks then its own language and tells that a given thing is well made, that a good order obtains within its bounds and that it is desirable-or the form shows the opposite of all this. Mere vision, however, will never account for the fact that a Chinese will classify a white man as an ugly pale devil, while a European is outfaced by outlandish features. But supposing that they mutually consider strange fea- tures unvoluntarily as something unhealthy morbid because they associate with these forms in their surrounding such meanings, then the principle of valuation would be quite rational. Concepts of Life Aesthetic response exhibits capriciousness despite a certain stability. It changes within the course of history, oscillates with- in the lifetime of the same person, varies within the same society, fluctuates according to sex and even age. The confusing ways of "taste" cannot be explained by perceptual facts; as an intellectual epiphenomenon however they would be quite comprehensible. Why should pink cheeks be beautiful and not pink hands? Is it a principle of perception that orders faces to be pink and hands pale? But when we state that red cheeks seem nice because red is in that con- text a symbol of health and youth which are desirable and that the white hands of a woman were a social ideal since time immemorial, the question of such aesthetic values is resolved. They would be functions of a concept of life. When we are aesthetically affected, we judge whole contexts of meaning, not single perceptual ele- ments. If we cover a face under a mask so that the most beautiful detail, a regular nose, brilliant eyes, remains uncovered, this detail will be unimpressive. A beautiful head, seen from behind, inversely, may look monstrous. We have to solve the question of stability, of variations and of</page><page sequence="4">Max Rieser preferences. Schopenhauer prefers an English garden to a Roman because the former is more natural. But this naturalness is evi- dently a question of degrees, since English gardens do not resemble primeval forests. Different styles of garden architecture mani- fest a different attitude towards nature which is the effect of an- other concept of life. It may likewise reflect a different Weltan- schaLuung whether a man prefers a palace to a cottage or vice versa. The European landscape is highly artificial, a work of men, and it may produce aesthetic response just as a primeval forest, the reason will be different and of spiritual character. The prefer- ence will depend on our conviction of the desirability of such dif- ferent types of countryside owing to a certain state of mind, to an attitude. Goethe loves Gothic cathedrals in his youth and classic structures in his later years. When we say that a man does not understand medieval paintings, we really mean that he does not understand the spirit, the concept of life which has originated them. A thick long mane is beautiful on a lion, but not in a man walking down a modern street. The perceptual fact of long hair is immaterial for the aesthetic valuation. In the Middle Ages long hair was the hair-do of the free and deemed beautiful, but in a banker sitting today at his desk it will be improper. However, in a prophet it will be fitting owing to the traditional image of prophets. He who would change the traditional figure of Christ will meet with violent objections. When the French began to dis- like the "artificiality" of Rococo life, they turned to Nature and discovered its value. This aesthetic revulsion was concomitant of intellectual processes. The peasants of the time did not share it. Reason will never tell whether an Empire salon is more or less beautiful than the Jungfrau mountain peak. Nor will perception yield the secret of such valuations. But if we inject the factor of meaning, then we may see that the mountain is deemed as some- thing mighty, sublime, pure, in other words as a symbol of some- thing we may love or desire, briefly as a meaningful structure. The poets develop in their works the reasons of the aesthetic response derived from objects. Thus Byron tells us in the "Hours of Idle- ness" in "Lachin y Gair": England! thy beauties are tame and domestic To one who has roved o'er the mountains afar: Oh for the crags that are wild and majestic, 61</page><page sequence="5">The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms The steep frowning glories of dark Loch na Garr! This description is symbolic and animistic. The author loves the mountain as the symbol of wildness and majesty, as a congenial being contrasted with the tame and domestic surroundings. But even an ancient, less articulate poet like Horace puts it thus: (Carminum liber I.V1111) Vides ut alta stet nive candidum Soracte. He admires the purity, the highness of the mount Soracte as opposed to the dirt of his city of Rome and its motley crowd which he despises: odi profanztm vugus et arceo? (Carminium III.1). Thus Soracte is a symbol for Horace. Thus meaning is the decisive factor within the world of aes- thetic response. "Green" may be agreeable to the vision, but is in itself not an aesthetic experience. The aesthetic green is not a simple green but a green within a context of meaning, and that is why a man may prefer it to other colors. It is not as easy to understand a Beethoven symphony as the miauling of a cat. If pleasurable arrangement of sounds constituted music, then it would be inexplicable why an African does not understand such a symphony. If we describe the music of desert Bedawins as mel- ancholy, we imply that the authors were not concerned with making pleasant noises but meaningful compositions. The pleasurable character of the tunes cannot be the reason of their being aes- thetically enjoyed. The whole history of music as an art would be incomprehensible if music were not regarded as a system of meaningful structures, meaningful within the framework of the ideas of an epoch and of individuals. Pleasurable tunes produced by a child with a toy were never considered as music. Differences in styles and even fashions become significative only as adjuncts of a spiritual evolution. Always having in mind differences in intensity, we may say that a natural object, a work of art, a figure, even a color, a line are potentially possible sources of aesthetic response. But more important still, even an idea may form such a source, and that disproves the assumption of the perceptual character of this emotion. We do not need material shapes or sounds to pro- duce aesthetic response. "Courage", everything heroic is aesthet- 62</page><page sequence="6">Max Rieser ically a positive value. The idea of St. George killing the dragon is aesthetically beautiful, the story of a deed of a courageous soldier. Do we mean the face of the soldier? No, his courage, his action. The story of David killing the giant Goliath has aesthetic value. Within the realm of ideas we think that a soldier is more beautiful than a merchant and a blacksmith (aesthetically) bet- ter than a tailor. But if ideas are aesthetically productive, how can it be assumed that aesthetic response is sensuous and con- comitant of perceptions, of shapes or colors? It is possible on the basis of the knowledge of the character of a man to predict with a certain amount of correctness what books or what landscapes or what furniture or what sort of human faces he will like or dislike. Such a prediction is difficult but may be quite consistent. What elements of judgment are at our disposal in such a case? We must be conversant with the general ideas of this man, his conceptions of life. Not with his aesthetic ideas. These are the unknown things we are going to find on the basis of his whole Weltanschauu?ng which furnishes the known elements of the equation. Archaism of Aesthetic Valzes. The scale of aesthetic values within the realm of ideas is not identical with the ethical, and this is a significant fact, not some- thing fortuitous. It is ethically indifferent whether a man is an engineer, a merchant or a soldier, a tailor or a blacksmith. Aes- thetically it is not so. To lie is both ethically evil and aesthetically ugly. To kill is ethically inferior to deceiving. But aesthetically it is worse to deceive than to kill. A heroic action is always aes- thetically beautiful, but from a moral standpoint a heroic action may sometimes be condemned. Non-resistance to evil may be ethically defensible; on the aesthetic scale the value of resisting and fighting ranges higher. If, however, sacrifice or suffering as- sumes heroic proportions, it becomes aesthetically positive. There seems to be more goodness than beauty in saintliness, and more beauty than goodness in heroism. It seems to me that the discrepancies between the ethical and aesthetical scales of valuation may be explained by the fact that the aesthetical scale is more archaic. As such it is also aristo- 63</page><page sequence="7">The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms cratic, it exalts strength, health and fighting virtues in men, and all such virtues in women which are commonly described as de- sirable. Thus the scale is not arbitrary, but determined by an archaic concept of existence. To be aware of these differences, standards of valuation may be important since sometimes a con- fusion of scales occurs. Thus it seems to me that Nietzsche mis- took the aesthetic scale for the ethical. A man may recognize the aesthetic scale despite himself, such is the power of this ancient value. He will admire a certain body which is deemed to express desirable qualities, although his realistic knowledge proves to him that he is the subject of an illusion. However, the force of the form- al interpretation of the body bequeathed by dead generations is stronger than his real knowledge. Thus a conflict may arise often described as conflict between "heart" and "mind", although "heart" is in this complex only the mind of generations past. As a matter of fact, the aesthetic scales of values as far as life values are concerned exercise a great power; every romantic movement will be inclined to fall back upon these values in all walks of life. How important emotional connotations are when human bodies are concerned seems to me obvious. I don't believe that an asexual being would have the same aesthetic ideal of a human body as we actually have, and by the same token all other aesthetic re- sponses would change because meanings arisen from our specific valuation of the human body influence valuations of other forms. If we ask ourselves why round contours are believed positive in a woman and square lines rather in a man, we shall find the answer in the world of meanings, not in the realm of perceptions. Modern man unlike his own ancestors and the Oriental today prefers slender figures, which is a clear corollary of a change in ideology. Growth of Aesthetic Vision. The young child who "sees" some day just well as we do, has scarcely any aesthetic ideals, the comprehension of such things as music, painting, or architecture is very slow in de- veloping and goes along the lines of general intellectual develop- ment. The general images of men, women and surroundings are 64</page><page sequence="8">Max Rieser basically fixed by habit. However, a man will understand the meaning of a face, differentiate between faces as means of ex- pression, associate some thought with such faces in order to pass aesthetic judgment. Otherwise they have as little meaning for him as for a child, and lie around as a heap of letters of a dead alphabet. The wisdom of ancestors transmitted by word of mouth or books or living customs bestows on all things their proper colors and their meaning; they acquire a living face and in the course of life are being associated with joyous or sorrowful experiences, and thus they may get a symbolic meaning, express something. The possibility of aesthetic response is growing ac- cording to all these experiences. The possibilities of interpretation increase since all these things are entangled in countless relations. A greater wealth of aesthetic experiences will gratify the modern man than a barbarian, and Byron will command a more com- plex system of aesthetic expression than an ancient. The system of aesthetic valuation will undergo great changes owing to the Chris- tian system of thought in the Middle Ages. Within the strata of the same society aesthetic response will be different even if there is some common ground. Almost everybody will grasp the beauty of the duel between David and Goliath, while it may be necessary in order to appreciate a painting by Gauguin to comprehend the disillusions and yearnings of modern men. Out of its intellectual context it may seem baffling. Transformation of Aesthetic Ideals. The aesthetic ideal of the common man may be archaic as to its ideal content, but it undergoes changes owing to transforma- tions of ideology. Then incrustations are formed around the core. Christianity and Chivalry will effect a change in the old ideal of woman, but some of these changes may disappear and give way to new changes. A pessimist in the mood of fin de siecle will appreciate different features of femininity than the average. He may dislike health and prefer artificiality and that will entail consequences of valuation. While in a certain frame of mind a man will appreciate good proportions or harmoniousness, another will reject them as dull. Still another may object to any orna- 66</page><page sequence="9">The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms ment or flourish as improper in the earnest business of life. He will exalt functionalism owing to an ideal of simplicity. But all these kinds of "taste" are consequences of a mental attitude. If we make allowance for some principle of order which I shall discuss later, all these transformations prove that things speak by means of harmoniousness, simplicity, ornamentation, a more material language, but that all these elements - harmony, sim- plicity, circularity - are nothing in themselves but terms of a language which is used in order to express something else. It is a rather circumstantial, heavy language, a language by innuendo, this language of forms, but we grasp its meaning. It is not so definite as verbal language, but it is easier, not exacting. It may be also deceptive because it discloses values by formalism of shapes, and this formalism is also archaic. It is as if it were a runic language of things super-added to their realistic meaning. In poetry it is even possible to arrange words in such a way as to express such added meaning by means of this arrangement alone, and thus we gain a second material symbolic language be- yond the pure ideational rational language. Beyond the rational meaning it is possible to glean an additional meaning from the mere form of things. And if this language is material and ar- chaic, the meaning it conveys and the values it presents may sometimes be also archaic in character. We must listen to this additional language of shapes accompanying the realistic signifi- cance of the things that confront us. If we do, we are plunged in a dreamy mood being half way in reality and halfway in a land- scape created by those implications stirred up by the symbolic language of these shapes. If we contemplate a mountain, a lake, a wood, we are aware of something arising on the borderline of this eternal snow or of the line of the ridge. This is precisely the atmosphere created by the symbolic implications of forms. The artist's special task is to arrange his materials as to let this second language speak, and it may be that this causes the belief, a mystical belief, that the artist has a more true or a deeper knowledge of the world than the thinker. Schopenhauer as well as Bergson will affirm that the artist presents a fuller and more immediate picture of the universe. And such ideas existed even in antiquity when it was assumed that the artist is possessed by a sort of divine folly which is called intuition in later epochs. This 6</page><page sequence="10">Max Rieser illusion may be reducible to the existence of the mysterious un- clearly felt second language of forms which in my opinion is more archaic and primitive than pure realistic thought. Principles of Order as Syntactical Manifestations. 1.) the orderly, 2.) the customary average. Aesthetic structures erected by men (works of art) exhibit a certain order. There is something "Csymmetric" even in the "asym- metric" and if something be a structure, it cannot be wholly C'"asymmetric". It sometimes seems as if that order reflected somehow the order also exhibited by organic living structures, for instance, bodies. A certain order within a structure is a premiss of aesthetic valuation. Only if the materials are ordered, are we able to "read" it as we read a face. This order seems to be an aesthetic syntax owing to which the composing materials acquire the property of aesthetic terms. Once faced by such manifestation of order, we are warned that we have to read and "decipher" in a double way, not only realistically, but also by listening to the accompanying runic language of forms. It is a memento, a clear indication to wit that a given structure is not merely a dwelling, but a dwelling so arranged as to express something by that arrangement. The order is beyond that mean- ingful, it furnishes by itself additional information. We are warned to scan the Latin stanza, in doing so we shall acquire im- mediately new knowledge from the rhythmic emphasis, knowledge for instance as to what is important, noticeable, etc. But we should separate these two facts: the fact of being an order, an organized thing, and the fact that this order may in addition mean something, i. e., be a representation. Grasping the order we see a phrase before us, not a logical, a telluric phrase; its syntax is more material, it organizes the very materials of the work, i. e., matter in a spatial or temporal way. It is indicated by the word "composition". The condition of order is basal, the whole struc- ture rests on it but there is no saying how the order should be realized. Music exhibits this order "temporally", architecture "spatially". In these arts order is most clearly discernable, and it sometimes may seem that the mere property of being ordered ex- 67</page><page sequence="11">The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms hausts the whole meaning of architecture, but this is an illusion. The architectural order has besides its function as order also a symbolic function. There is no abstract order but always a certain specific order, and this individual specificity and definite- ness is meaningful, expressive of a mental attitude, it explains for instance the difference of "styles". The order may be called sometimes rhythm, sometimes, rhyme, sometimes it is the order of Doric columns. It may be more horizontal in Greek architecture, and assume vertical lines in Gothic, Indian, or modern American structures, it may be an arrangement of windows or a metre. A Greek temple and a Gothic cathedral are different, they attest different ideals of life and thought. The aesthetic order is obviously more primitive in being not an order of logical contents, but of materials; it is nevertheless based on the same intellectual principle as an archaic manifestation of the latter.-The importance of order was always strongly felt. There is magic in order. Proph- ecies, incantations were rhythmically ordered; it is as if the row of columns were also a magic incantation, an appeal by means of rhythm. Representative i. e., symbolical value was always attributed to order. Thus we see that "harmoniousness" may be the embodiment of order, yet it is only an aesthetic term just as disharmony, namely a tool of expression of some idea. It has been affirmed that "pur- posefulness", teleology, realized in an object causes the latter to be positively aesthetic. This would be a logical, rationalistic principle, but such rationalization does not seem correct. When seeing a handsome athlete, do we make an analysis of the usefulness of his body? I doubt it. We may discover that he has ugly ears. We are not concerned with the problem whether it is good to hear with such ears. We feel that they lack certain proportions and are keenly disappointed. We say that the "eye" revolts. But why should it? Is it "easier" to see perfect than long ears? Our at- tention will be fixed on such a blot persistently, but this psychic strain has nothing to do with vision nor with the realistic purpose- fulness of the ears for the business of hearing. However very early in our lives we attribute to shapes a functional meaning. We know for instance chilblains or swellings and attribute them to morbidity or ill health and value them simultaneously as ugly. 68</page><page sequence="12">Max Rieser Even a small boy may raise objections to a person's features saying: "these are funny ears" or "too great a head". Thus he seems to have a definite idea about the right proportions of the human body. If he chooses and rejects forms, he does so hardly on the basis of a realistic analysis. Will, however, the boy brought up in Belgian Congo have the same sensation of liking and repulsion as another boy in Stockholm? Certainly not. It is more reason- able to assume that the boy developed on the basis of his ex- periences some image of an average head in good healthy condition. In the realm of logical thinking we likewise acquire after a cer- tain time a sort of idea what a "book" or a "table" is. This is the virtual definition of the object. We may assume that in the language of aesthetics this average image of the "right" head is a structure corresponding to the logical structure of concepts. Such a right head is the desirable thing to have. The aesthetic response would thus relate to the desirable content which the shape rep- resents. This would explain how we can value aesthetically im- material things like courage, since we always value the more or less desirable content of the form, i. e., the form as function not as substance, we may then after removal of the shell, the shape, still pass judgment upon the desirability of a content on the basis of a scale called aesthetic. Having always valued qualities which those shapes were supposed to represent, we may now value the qualities as such. Elements of Aesthetic Analysis. What reasons of preference will a man advance if confronted by a dog-rose and a rose. The majority is likely to prefer the (garden) rose, not the (wild) dog-rose. It will be said, for in- stance that the rose is more developed, fuller, richer, etc. These reasons mark a spiritual attitude, they evince the love of the rose as expression of richness, fullness, etc. The same reasons may be advanced for the preference of a "mature" beauty as opposed to a young girl, or a Corinthian capital as opposed to a Doric, or a late Renaissance painting as contrasted with the "primitives". And if one prefers slim birches to sturdy oaks, the mere adjectives show what is meant by that: slimness or 69</page><page sequence="13">The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms sturdiness as objectivized by the thing. But roses also have their implications created by history, by reading, by one's life; and this sphere of meanings, of buried emo- tions will vibrate whenever we see the rose. Its roundness is preg- nant with implications: it resembles a chalice or some other object, and the arrangement of its petals realizes a principle of order. If we cut the flower into two, the beauty will be destroyed, we shall feel what the boy feels when he says "funny ears" or "big head". If I see a piano and assert tllat it is beautiful I do not think of playing. What I have in mind is its shape, and I try to find the meaning of that shape; I follow the lines looking after the principle of order, etc. I do not consider the mechanical fitness of the instrument, but another more primitive fitness expressed by the shape. The primitive automobiles looked like buggies without horses and seemed just unfinished, "funny" like the irregular ears. Their form raised the expectation of a horse, but when this ex- pectation was thwarted we were rather grieved. The modern auto- mobile looks more like a finished being not dependent on horses. The Composite and the Simple Our long-haired man labelled "banker" was aesthetically bad, as "prophet" he might have been satisfactory. Let us remove the label and consider the man irrespective of any occupation. We shall be unable to extricate him from all relations, we shall still relate him to something and combine, all of which will affect our judgment. He may be old and then his long hair may be more proper than in a young man. If we identify his face as probably that of a soldier, we shall certainly resent the long hair. However, the removal of labels will gradually extenuate the aesthetic response; in restricting the range of meanings, we reduce the intensity of enjoyment. Certainly even the hair alone can be subjected to valuation, but this process of narrowing down the context has its limit, a hair-do may still signify something aesthetically, but scarcely a single lock. This hair may be fair or dark, silky or coarse. If fair, it may depend upon our upbringing, our race, the hair of our parents, our ideas about fairness and darkness, whether we shall like the fair hair. All these implications will influence our choice. Silky hair may be preferred because we like shiny things, soft hair because it is more TO</page><page sequence="14">Max Rieser agreeable when touched, etc. All these considerations will be of importance in forming our judgment and the response. We may see a facade of red marble bearing the inscription "Funeral Chapel" and find it "atrocious". It will be "lacking in dignity", inconsistent with the "majesty of death", etc. These are purely spiritual terms. They are due to our idea as to what colors are or should be associated with death. Let us tear down our inscription and write on the facade "Night Club". Now it may be felt as excellent. We may remove all tags and contemplate the facade in itself. Then we shall consider the principles of order, the lines, whether round or square, but even that will have a mean- ing, and so will have the material (quality and color of stone) since even this material is symbolically significant. The mere ex- amination of the cathedral of Milan which is mainly in Gothic style but of white marble shows the symbolic significance of the material. The impression is totally different from that caused by any other edifice. It does not seem to reflect those religious moods which have had their bearing on a "real" Gothic edifice. Similarly nobody will make earrings of iron but of gold or silver. Thus struc- tures are interpretable and our cities are avenues of symbols ex- hibiting the terms of the language of forms. Aesthesis and Artistic Creation. I would call aesthesis the act of grasping the symbolic function of a thing. The response will be positive or negative, dependent on whether we assume that its form or perceptual aspect is a symptom of a desirable or not desirable content. If the form assume such a meaning, we grasp it as an aesthetic term. The desirability embodied in the form is measured basally on a more ancient scale of values. That explains how an idea may become an aesthetic term and why it may be at variance with the ethical scale. What is positive as aes- thetic term must not be so as perception. For instance, dazzling light may be disagreeable for our sense of sight and sublime from the aesthetic point of view owing to our metaphysical and kindred ideas about light. Every object may become an aesthetic term inso- far as it assumes a symbolic function: if I see in the birch the em- bodiment of slimness or of something else I value or dislike, the birch 71</page><page sequence="15">The Symbolic Function of Aesthetic Terms becomes an aesthetic term. This symbolic function creates the emo- tional link between me and the object transforming the latter into such a term. Artistic ability is the specific intellectual ability of arranging materials in such a way as to make their symbolic func- tion suggestive. By his arrangement the artist exhibits in sug- gestive concentration and with significant emphasis what I must rather seek in the world of things. The lyrical poet shows the sym- bolic function of the objects of nature. Therefore in his attitude which is anthropomorphic the things become animistic. If we would not interpret the things as meaningful embodiments, then they would be so indifferent to our self as sheets of paper on a desk. There is no preference in the mind of a naturalist for a volcano as opposed to a mole-hill. But in aesthesis we envision the former symbolically and say: wrath, power, height. Emotional Attitude The attitude towards the good and the beautiful is emotionally different. Beautiful things, whether persons, forests or paintings, are desirable also in a literal sense. He who sees them, covets them. This is an attitude of self-assertion. However we would rather offer ourselves to the good. This is the position of sacrifice. The ampli- tude of this "giving" may range from a mere doing to dying. Nezw York City 72</page></plain_text>
