<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Human Figure in Archaic Chinese Writing A Study in Attitudes By L. C. HOPKINS (PLATE IX.) T)ORTRAITURE, as we now know, was a very early member of the nascent arts of primitive man. Palaeolithic men were of necessity hunters. What they hunted on the plains and among the hills for food and covering, that they painted or carved on the walls and roofs of their cave dwellings and cliff shelters. The reindeer, the bison, the horse, the elephant were favourite objects of their vivid and impressionistic genius. What they lacked of imagination they made up for by exact memories and singularly skilful technique. Less frequent were their delineations of humanity, and as concerns the female part of it, most unflattering, being affected by a kind of exasperated candour.1 The Age of Chivalry was far distant indeed ! But the particular feature in primitive drawing of the human figure that I wish to call attention to is its marked linearity. This feature recurs in the art of the Bushman ; among the Eskimos ; among the Red Indian tribes ; among the Chukchi of North-East Siberia,2 and doubtless among other existing primitive peoples, though in none of them is the linear mannerism the sole method of portraiture adopted. More over, it is a very ancient mannerism, being conspicuous in some of the scenes recorded by Palaeolithic artists in Spain. Obermaier distinguishes such figures as Nematomorphic. Let us thank the Spanish archaeologist for " nemato morphic ". It is a good word and an elongated, and shares 1 Sec, e.g. Miss Helen Tonguo's Bushman Paintings, pi. xxviii, where tho stcatopygy of tho femalo figures inusfc bo seen to bo believed.

This linearity, this enforced reduction of the human frame, is strikingly manifest in archaic Chinese script. We shall find it in the different forms of man, whether seen frontally or in profile, alike in action and at rest. In this Paper, owing to the abundance of material deserving attention, it is proposed to restrict our study to those typical characters that represent man as seen in profile, and, normally, facing to the left. And first of all, to that of the most ancient character for jen, man, now written in three ways, \ as an independent word, and -f and J^, when in combination. And we may note in passing that the first of these combining forms comes closer to the archaic shape than does \ jen, the orthodox scription of the character when standing alone. Type 1 Figures 1 to 4 on Plate IX represent variants of the earliest type that we can assign with certainty to the word jen, man, though it is possible that another rather fuller design may in the future prove its claim to represent the same word. Wo shall come to it later. For instance, Chalmers, usually so careful, says of it, " the prevailing characteristic is the two lines for the legs." x And Wieger, while actually citing the Shuo Wen's imputative statement, writes, " Jen,2 a man represented by his legs." a Yet the Shuo Wen's words are % $f JJ&lt;? ;? J&amp;, that is, " depicts the arm and the leg." And there can be no doubt that the Shuo Wen was right in this, and that the left-hand stroke is the extended arm. And here may I point out a peculiarity or mannerism of the artists who designed the prehistoric pictography of the Chinese (if Chinese they were), in that in drawing profile figures, whether human or animal, they seldom represented more than half the real number of 1 Structure of Chinese Characters, p. 0. 2 Chinese Characters (lOng. edition), p. 71.</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 559 limbs, one arm and one leg for man, one fore and one hind leg for beasts. So much then, for the oldest examples of jen, man, qua character, worn down and worn out by hard and ceaseless use to a headless, handless and footless trunk. But we are about to examine forms, some found on archaic Bronzes, and more on the Honan Bone relics, that offer what must have been, typologically, a more ancient, and artistically a more veritable portrait of Man seen in profile. Some of these forms wo cannot yet attach to any known Chinese word, being ignorant as to what later characters correspond to, and have replaced them. Some occur so far only in composition. But all are visibly human figures at rest or in action. Type 2 Proceeding from the simple to the more complex forms, let us begin with one that has already been illustrated and partly discussed in a previous number of this Journal.1 For con venience sake the two variants are now repeated as Figs. 5 and 6. It is not generally the aim of this Paper to debate questions of the correct equation of archaic forms with modern characters, so that we need not here try to decide whether Figs. 5 and 6 are primitive drawings standing for \ jen, man, or for 7c yuan, prime, or for J- tzu, son. What is clear is that they depict a man with a head on his shoulders, but otherwise tho same as Figs. 1 to 4. We find this same type in groups of two, three, and even four, in certain unknown compound characters on very early Bronzes. Thus Fig. 7 is from Yuan Yuan's collection of inscriptions, Chi Ku Chai, etc., chilan 1, p, 29. I call special attention to Fig. 8, which is clearly a variation of Fig. 7. I copied it some twenty-one years ago from a Bronze lance-head inscribed on one side, and forming part of the Wang Collection of Antiquities in the Museum of the Anglo 1 JUAS., July, 1020, " Piotographio Reconnaissances," Part VII, pp. HM-r&gt;, and Plato VI, Kiga. 1 and 2.</page><page sequence="4">560 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN Chinese College, Tientsin. This exhibition was derived from the valuable collection of a well-known antiquarian, Wang I-jung, a Grand Secretary, living in Peking at the time of the Boxer movement. " On the entry of the Foreign Contingents into Peking, whence nearly all the official class had fled, the Grand Secretary, solitary and helpless, following the precedents of the antiquity he knew so well,' faced the north,' made the due obeisance for the last time, and then with his wife and widowed daughter-in-law, threw himself into a well and perished." The " strange Pictogram " (Fig. 8, similar ones arc found elsewhere) " seems to represent four human figures under what may possibly be a standard." So far as I know, this figure has never been published before. Type 3 Another simple type to be noted is that of the crouching or kneeling man. From it arc derived tho Lesser Seal and modern characters ^b, and )\^ or /\, found only in composition. The two varying scriptions of jen, viz. \ and )\^, are separated in the Shuo Wen for reasons of expediency in classifying the large number of compounds of each, for some follow one form and some the other. But in the earliest times the two types were derived from the same model of humanity, which was, as it were, sawn asunder, the upper half ultimately becoming \, and the lower, )\^, each semi-human relic claiming to be jen, man. Even in the most archaic inscriptions the kneeling type is very rarely found as an independent character, but in compound formations it abounds. Figs. 9,10, and 11, however, may be cited as standing by themselves. Figs. 12 to 15 show differences in detail, and are combining-forms, as appears from the compound characters on the Plate. It is not the aim of this Paper to equate all the ancient types reviewed with their corresponding modern equivalents,</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 561 unless for one reason or another this is helpful to its main purpose. But it seems appropriate to quote a short passage in which Lo Chen-yu gives his considered opinion on the nature of the figures we are examining. He says,1 " The Shuo Wen explains fy ling as, to issue a command ; composed with y/\ tsi, and |1 tsieh, joint or tally." Lo, however, has a different opinion ; " It appears " he says, " that in the ancient writing fy ling was composed with /\ and A jen, man, q.d. to assemble a number of men and give them authoritative commands. Hence in ancient times &lt;fr ling and fir ming were one character and had one meaning, #fc *? fa $^ fir $ ? ^ ? j5ft. When Hsii in his Work (the Shuo Wen) explains P (tsieh, in Hsu's eyes) as an auspicious token, he did not know that the ancient form ?* depicted a man kneeling, and was the character A jen, man, |&amp; A RB ffl 6|J A ^ -lit- All the characters ranged under Jj (The Shuo Wenys 338th Radical) are wrongly analyzed." My only hesitation in accepting this valuable dictum of Lo's is confined to a doubt whether the crouching or kneeling figure was actually employed to write the word jen, or was possibly tho written form of some other syllable But in any case, when this type is not at the bottom but at the side of a modern character, it is miswritten, and believed to be [1 tsieh, joint. Type 4 Mounting one rung of the scale of complexity we reach a form, marked by a certain picturesque naivete, but tempting the investigator to advance over some ice that is exceedingly thin. Figs. 16 and 17 (also found reversed, 18) appear to be merely more finished variants of the last type, and indeed they must really be so, for they occur sometimes on the Honan Bones in place of the more usual Fig. 19, as " supporters " in the compound character % hsiang. The uppermost element, which in certain other characters is 1 Yin Ilsil Shu Ch'i K'ao Shih, p. 61, s.v. &lt;fy Ling.</page><page sequence="6">562 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN found similarly placed, seems a mere convention for a head and face seen in profile. Strictly regarded however, it is in form an ad hoc application of the ordinary character for P k'ou, mouth, rotated to the right or left through a quadrant of a circle, and serving at once as a significant gesture, and as an enforced aberrancy from the normal position of the mouth character in order to avoid identity with the archaic scription of jfj;, hsiung, elder brother. However this may be, Fig. 16, and its reverse, separated by an element expressing food on a dish are seen facing each other in Fig. 20, representing the modern $|{ hsiang, village, in form, but ^ hsiang, to offer food, in meaning.1 Now Lo Chen-yu surmises 2 very acutely that the Shuo Wen's Lesser Seal form Fig. 21 (its 341st Radical and now written #P), represents the Honan Bone form, Fig. 19 ; that the latter is identical with a more naturalistic and ampler sign, Fig. 22, found very rarely on those relics; that this latter portrays two men facing each other ; that it is the true scription of the later character fgf hsiaiig, towards, just as Figs. 23 or 24 (modern Jfc pei, North, but also, to turn the back on), depicts two men back to back. I infer then, for Lo does not explicitly say this, that he regards each half of Fig. 22 as a fully finished variant of the character \ jen. Type 5 Analogous to the last type, and formed of the same com ponents, but having the upper element only reversed, is Fig. 25 (and reversed, Fig. 26). This quaint formation represents the modern J? chi, and so far as I know, at no phase of its career occurs as an independent character, but is fairly common in compounds. It is said by the Shuo Wen to mean " to choke ". But it is well to proceed very cautiously with regard to it. 1 See this fully discussed in JRAS. for 1917, " Piotographio Reuon naisBancoH," Part I, pp. 805-7, and oapooially tho Plato, bMgH. 1120 5. ? Y.H.S.K.K.S., p. M root.</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 563 First of all, it is a fact that the modern scription of chi descends not, as usual, from the Lesser Seal version, ^, but from the real archaic construction shown above, Fig. 26, for the upper element in the Lesser Seal is modern *% ch'i, vapour, but in the archaic and the modern forms alike, it is a deflexion of p k'ou, mouth. Next, we find that the Shuo Wen states that the character 5t chi is fc ch'ien, reversed ($fc fyC ft)&gt; and so, in the Lesser Seal it is, where ^ is the Lesser Seal scription of fc ch'ien, but it is not so in the archaic or modern shapes. But the statement that fc ch'ien and 5L chi were thus correlated forms is interesting and important. Lastly, the Shuo Wen gives us a Ku wen or ancient form of ?L chi, and, if the shape is as Hsli originally wrote it, this was Fig. 27. But both tho Honan relics and the old Bronzes prove that this is erroneously written as regards tho lower element, and that the Ku wen should be Fig. 28, even when negligently finished off. Now such a form corresponds strictly to the archaic Fig. 26. What then is the significance of this character, in which the mouth (or the head and mouth) faces in the contrary direction to that of the body ? Such a posture seems to require some correlated sign wherein the mouth and head have a more normal relation to the rest of the human body. And this normal relation is seen at once in Type 4, where both body and head face in the same forward direction. If therefore Type 5 (Figs. 25 or 26) shows us the archaic design of 5t chi, to choke, and if the Shuo Wen is right in describing this chi as the reverse of ch'ien to gape, then Type 4, e.g. Fig. 18, must be that reverse, and consequently stand for ch'ien. Now, it is true, we might have expected that in a character picturing a gaping mouth the' upper element would have been left open, that is, without the short downstroke, thus zd not D- And as to that we should note Tuan Yii-ts'ai's statement that in Hsu Ch'ieh's Edition of the Shxio Wen the character fc ch'ien is written as Fig. 29, that is with an obviously open mouth. Nevertheless, on the Honan Bones,</page><page sequence="8">564 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN no example known to me appears with the mouth thus left open. But, on the other hand, Takada in the Ku Ghou PHen,1 gives several examples (all in compound characters) of ^ cKien, written with the mouth widely opened as shown by Figs. 30 and 31, the last from the Stone Drums, the others from ancient Bronzes. Loth as T always am to differ from tho excellent judgment of Lo Ohen-yii, the facts and considerations set out above seem more consistent with an identification of the headed and kneeling figures in Fig. 22, with the open-mouthed forms shown in Figs. 30 and 31, and of all four with ft chHen, than with the simple character \jen, as Lo thinks. Type G Proceeding now from head to foot, we reach a simple design where the head is ignored and the foot emphasized by exaggeration. This design is found, but very rarely, as an independent character, on the Honan Bones ; and in com position, both there and on ancient Bronzes. Figs. 32 and 33 (they appear to be variants) occur on the Bones, and Fig. 34 on Bronze, in the character now generally written Jfc chih, to bring about, an effect, but also in the early scription of $E han, cold, and of $&amp; p*o, an indigenous race in Ssuchuan Province. Lo Chen-yii identifies this formation, and very justly it would seem, with the modern fe eKi, to stand on tiptoe, but not so Takada2 who sees in it % ch'ui or sui, Kanghsi's 35th Radical. An attractive example of this type (not otherwise known to me) is cited by Takada, Ku Ghou PHen, ch. 54, p. 18, whence I have copied Fig. 34a. He considers it " without doubt the most archaic form of $| chii, to hold on to ", and rightly says the human figure and the staff make a picture of someone supported by a staff, ;fet $p J&amp; Jf2 chang cKih hsiang hsing, and %t ffl cfuing ch*ih is the definition of the Shuo Wen for 1 K.C.P., chiian 37, pp. 7, 8^ chiian 35, p. 9. 2 K.C.P., ch. 03, p. 20.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 565 the character $| chil, while Takada treats the remaining element (% yu, the right hand) as equivalent to the ;f shou in the character $$ chil. This is very ingenious and may well be the true explanation. It would, therefore, seem reasonable to conclude that without the hand element, the figure with the staff stands for tho most primitive scription of %t chang, a staff, or to uso a staff. But Takada cannot insert any example taken from original documents of either ?? or fet&gt; but only his own " reconstructions " of them, from their component elements (ife Jf} tsi hsing). Type 7 So far we have considered the human form in various attitudes. But in Type 7 wo are to deal with a figure that up to quite recent years was believed to stand for a demonic or spectral being, as well as for that part of the disembodied spirit of man that returns to the Earth after the vital spark has been quenched. In the popular mind it is applied to evil spirits incarnate in various monstrous, horrific, or loathly shapes, such, for example, as Europeans. These shapes are often partially anthropomorphic as appears in the written character Jjj kuei, devil, which includes the form for kneeling man (Type 3), while the upper part is thought to have once depicted the head and features of some frightful fiend, Figs. 35 and 36. This may be tho true account, but on the whole I incline to agree with Takada's view that the character portrays a man kneeling and wearing some ceremonial headgear while he renders their due rights to the spirits of the dead. His actual words are ifc $&amp; n? ft hsiang tai kuan pien, " depicts the wearing of a ceremonial cap." Such an interpretation of the whole character is consonant (not to put it higher) with the Shuo Wen's ancient form Fig. 37, which, strangely enough, is confirmed by a Honan bone example, Fig. 38, the left-hand element in both cases being jr shih, to indicate, a sign, (the regular Determinative for characters relating to worship and spiritual beings).</page><page sequence="10">566 THE HUMAN FIGUKE IN It is curious that whereas the Lesser Seal shape of the upper element in j^ kuei, is, according to the Shuo Wen, &amp;, and explained as " a spectre's head ", the two examples given above, Figs. 35 and 36 (one from the well-known Mao Kung Caldron, the other from the Honan relics), are simply, as there written, m t'ien, fields. But of course they are merely stylized reductions of some earlier and more complex figure. And the crux of decipherment is to discover how this earlier figure was designed, and what it was meant to represent. The solution now to be proposed, while based in the main on Takada's and my own reading of the type shown in Figs. 35 and 36, goes further, and presents a novel decipherment of a very strange but little known figure forming part of the complex in Figs. 39 and 40.1 I should say at onco that Takada, who has much to say on the matter, holds a very different view from mine. Shortly then, the complex in question is found within what I have elsewhere called " a cartouche ", it is a characteristic framework considered to be the old and true form of the modern character jSJi ya, and to stand for the ground-plan of an ancestral hall. In a rather wide range of variation of detail it occurs on a number of the most archaic Bronzes, Takada citing (ehuan 36, p. 32) no less than twenty-nine examples. He now believes the enclosed group to be a very ancient scription of the word #} chao, to beckon, invite, and identifies the right-hand element with the later character written JL,2 in composition, but not now found alone. I am not here concerned to discuss the whole complex. But I do not accept his equation of the right-hand part, and in place of it, I suggest that we see in it a very archaic form of $&amp; kuei. Like Takada, I suppose the curious upper part to represent the head and elaborate headgear. Like him too, I see in the 1 Figs. 39 and 40aro copied by mo from tho facsimiles in tho / Shu Ts'ung Pien, vol. xii {pjfc 3J? jff, ~p, p. 35, and vol. viii, ibid., J-, p. 3). 2 It forniH tho right-hand part of ^ chih, to gniHp, an now wiitton.</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 567 linear lower part the body with one arm extended, raising apparently a wine jar from a holder or chafing dish, and, as Takada says, clothed in full dress (of ceremonial worship, as I suppose). And I further see in the unusual spiral termination below, (not, we may note, in the Bone or usual Bronze examples), the probable origin of the little element J^ present in both the Lesser Seal and modern forms, displaced first, and then misunderstood by the Han and later scholars. I should add that such a novel decipherment would not necessarily militate against the Japanese epigraphist's solution of the whole complex as fg chao, to beckon. And there I leave the character kxtei, whether as pious worshipper, or grisly spectre, for the future to decide, but in any case gratified that Mr. Takada and myself concur in believing that the .quaint figure in Figs. 39 and 40 represents the human form viewed in profile. Type 8 Few looking at the modern version of this obscure, insignificant, and mostly miswritten character ?? rt,ul discovering that it means a hatpin or hairpin (for which, however, the much larger Jf? tsan is now substituted), would expect to find it included in a study of types of the human figure. Nor would they probably be helped by certain of the much stylized old forms that are recorded, e.g. Fig. 41, the parent of the Lesser Seal scription. But the uncertainty is illuminated when we see a very archaic and picturesque drawing, Fig. 42, cited by Takada (Ku Chou P'ien, ch. 35, p. 17). Here the man's outline is plain enough, and the only question is what does the projecting object above his head stand for ? It looks more like a large comb than a hat-pin, although again, it might be a decorative feather. One thing is certain. It is some sort of fastening or ornament worn by a man, perhaps characteristic of some non-Chinese race.</page><page sequence="12">568 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN Type 9 It seems perhaps a questionable arrangement that classifies the two Figs. 42 and 43 under one head. But the action indicated by each being as I think, apparently closely related, they are both treated conveniently together. For here, surely, we are privileged to witness the domesticities of the bathtub and the wash-basin, as practised in the most ancient China. The pictogram exhibited in Fig. 42 is extant in two examples only, and those of Shang or Yin dynasty date. Facsimile reproductions appear in vol. x, p. 28, of the / Shu Ts'ung Pirn Koview, in the series entitled Yin wen ts'un, or " Extant writing of the Yin dynasty ". Until Mr. Takada's Ku Ghou P'iv.n was published, the Figure had never to my knowledge been identified with any modern character, nor commented on at all. Takada's ingenious equation of it with the modern character [!jjjj5 Ian, to grasp, is thus defended. He says (chiian 54, p. 19), " The sound and meaning cannot be actually proved, but a scrutiny of the figure shows that it consists of l\\[ min, a vessel or dish, and of a man grasping an object and gazing into it " (Query, the object or the vessel ?). And a little later he adds, " advancing his head and looking downwards into tho vessel" (A M iftt ~F M 5?S JIH ? + -tit), while " the element [\ shows the idea of grasping " (3C K Ml $t W I confess I do not quite grasp the Japanese scholar's idea. Why should a man looking down into a vessel close below him want to grasp any object, in fact, with what object does he look downward ? To my mind there is a far more easily explained interpretation, and this is it. We have a linear sketch of a man stooping over a basin. From his crudely drawn head a rope of hair hangs down which he grasps, perhaps about to dip it into the basin, perhaps wringing it out to dry. There seems a certain grotesque truthfulness in the drawing of the attitude. I do not desire to equate it with any existing Chinese character, beyond suggesting that it might be a variant of Fig. 43, now to be considered.</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 569 According to Lo Chen-yU, this is the early way of writing the character $c hui, explained by the Shuo Wen as " to wash the face ". And Lo describes the old figure as depicting a man with dishevelled hair close to a basin washing his face (|$? \ m m m jih m m ? m It is quite possible to reconstruct Lo's archaic group in modern script, when it would appear as $1, if it were in Kanghsi's Dictionary, which it is not. The primitive artist was in trouble with the upper right hand and arm, and just did the best he could. These two figures admirably illustrate a signal difficulty that meets tho inquirer into tho history of Chinese writing, and one that Mr. Takada again and again points out in his Ku Ohou P'ien, namely the constant abandonment of an original pictogram in favour of some more easily written phonetic compound, or less often, of one constructed on the hui i or suggestive combination principle. When this change has taken place, the investigating sleuth-hound finds that the scent is absolutely lost. And more than that, it cannot but leave a large margin of doubt on every conjectural equation with a modern form, however plausible and ingenious. Type 10 The type now about to engage our attention is larger, more expressive, and of greater interest because of the important compounds of which it forms part, than those we have hitherto passed in review. Yet this form has not existed as an independent character since, probably, the Shang dynasty, say, the close of the second millennium B.C., for it has been found in its archaic aspect on the Honan relics. Kanghsi prints its modern form as %\, and the Shuo Win gives the Lesser Seal shape as ^, and adds that " it is read like j$? chi ". The same authority explains its meaning as ffi 4fc ch'ih yeh, to grasp, and basing himself on the construc tion of the Lesser Seal, states that the figure depicts the hand</page><page sequence="14">570 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN having something in its grasp. From which it is clear that Hsu Shen had not seen the true archaic scription, reproduced in Figs. 44 to 48. These designs, it should be remarked, are exceptional in that they do not conform to the practice noticed earlier in this paper of representing only two of the four limbs of man and quadrupeds seen in profile. Here we see both arms extended. The type is mostly found in composition, but Figs. 44 and 45 stand alone. In the first two the attitude suggests prayer, supplication, or high respect. In the third, Fig. 46, the relation of the two hands seems to indicate that some object is being carefully held, though none is actually shown in this instance, as though an offering of sacrifice was about to be made, an interpretation that is confirmed by the presence of a variant of the character jpr shih, the Determinative of spiritual beings and ceremonies. Figs. 47 and 48 are clearly identical with 46, though the artist's want of skill appears to make both hands spring from one arm. Wu Ta-ch'eng cites Fig. 47 from a bronze under the entry jjill ssu, to sacrifice, but Takada also citing the same bronze, treats it as a *jff ^ tjp ku i tzu, i.e. an archaic and obsolete character, which he reconstructs in what he holds would be its modern aspect, as $fl. Whether Wu or Takada is right, or whether neither is, it is very interesting to meet the exact double of Fig. 47 on a cowrie in my collection, II. 318, Fig. 48, for it is unique among those relics, and unknown to the Chinese and Japanese scholars, from the various other collections. * * * * Among the compound formations in which this type takes part is the archaic prototype of the character $ ycrng, to lift up, exalt, mount, expand. This is remarkable for the large range of variation presented by the very numerous instances occurring in the oldest bronze and bone inscriptions recorded and now accessible. And it is a long-pondered consideration of these variants that has led me slowly to a new, heterodox, and perhaps startling deduction of the origin and true</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 571 significance of the included element |J yang. This is variously rendered by various writers as " the opening up of the day light " (Chalmers), " to expand, glorious " (Wieger), " Male. Ciel: firmament. Clair " (Callery). These authors all follow the Shuo Wen in its analysis of the character ^ as being composed of p jih, sun, and #) wu, a flag (now written ffij), which certain personages of rank were entitled to fly ; and they equally accept its explanation of the meaning, as [jft k'ai, to open. Opr first concern, however, is with the compound character % y&lt;m&amp;&gt; m&amp; 'n ^e course of examining its archaic predecessors I shall have to maintain that the composition and significance of its main element ^ yang, has been totally misunderstood, and in consequence wrongly analysed, by the school to which Hsii Shen, the author of the Shuo Wen, belonged, and whose teaching he accepted and transmitted. And this, owing to ignorance of the vast store of Shang and Chou documents in bronze and bone that have since been exhumed and studied. In order that the argument may be more conveniently followed, I have selected nine examples of the archaic variants of fy yang, arranging them in a series from the most to the least complex groups, Figs. 49 to 57. All of these except the last comprise some variant of $L chi, to hold or grasp, Type 10, corresponding in function though not in form to the Determinative %&gt; shou, hand, of the Lesser Seal and modern versions ^ of $J yang. The first three, Figs. 49 to 51, have apparently three other elements ; the next two have two out of those three, Figs. 52 and 53 ; Figs. 54 and 55 have only one ; and the last two again, have two. It is impossible with our present knowledge to ascertain which of all these variations represents the most primitive model. All we can do is to attempt to reconstruct the pictorial ideal in the mind of the ancient artist, and that, as I hope to show, has not yet been done in full for the most complex, nor even for some of the simpler versions. The author of the Shuo Wen had not seen such combinations as Figs. 49 to 57,</page><page sequence="16">572 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN so that his analysis of the Lesser Seal character is inevitably inadequate to explain them. The clue, however, has now been found. Whoever will look at Figs. 54 and 55 will discover more quickly where the solution lies when he realizes what the circle with its central dot was intended to represent. It does not, and it never did, represent 0 jih, the sun, as Hsu Shen believed. On the contrary, it depicts the %g pi, or large disk of jade, with its central circular aperture. Splendid specimens of these jades arc in Mr. George Eumorfopoulos* cabinets. Such tokens of authority and symbols of rank were held in the hands (as these figures show) at audiences of the monarch, and expressed homage or ceremonious thanks. Besides these, in many cases, wo find the character for jade, fj? yii, added sometimes above, oftcner beneath, the pi or disk, perhaps partly to avoid that very confusion with fj jih, the sun, that nevertheless ensued later. But there remains, as the lowest part of the larger variants, an element which provides the only point of uncertainty in the composition. It seems to take two forms. One, less usually seen in the archaic character, certainly appears to be, as the Shuo Wen says, the character %j wu. The second, a frequent alternative to %} wu, is a simple T-shaped form whose stem generally curves either to the right or the left. It is the first of these two varieties that reappears in the Lesser Seal and modern scriptions of ^ yang. The second, or T-shaped sign, as it seems to me, may reasonably be held to form part of the first. But whether it is the parent shape, or a residual contraction, I am not able to say. I may, however, observe that it is found again in the bone version of the character there written \? and /fi) (now itjt ning), where above it is J|H win&gt; dish, and where it seems natural to regard the lower element as indicating some sort of stand or support.

The Human Figure in Archaic Chinese Writing.</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 573 what I suppose T to stand for in the variants of $? yang where it appears. That is to say, that it represents some kind of pedestal or footed base from which the jade disk was raised at the proper moment, as seems to be displayed in a crudely drawn example of the character illustrated in the Chin Ts'un Section, additional chitan 2, 1st plate, in vol. xxi of the / Shu Ts'ung Pien (see Fig. 58 on Plate).1 It must not be forgotten that no explanation of f|J yang or of its compon ent^f yang, will be sufficient that does not account for tho whole complex of the more elaborate and archaic versions of the character in question. To sum up the significance of the primitive pictogram later replaced by $} yang. To suggest and exemplify the physical action of raising, and the figurative sense of exalting, both embodied in the word yang, we have a human figure with extended arms raising in both hands a circular disk of jade from what appears to be an honorific support and stand. It would follow from such a view that the simple character H Vana (without any Determinative) cannot in the earliest ages have existed, except as a conscious contraction of the more explicit flj or similar composite form. Type 11 This need not detain us long, having been discussed in the Journal for 1927 in " Pictographic Reconnaissances", part viii, pp. 771-7, and illustrated on Plate VII, Figs. 8-10. In that paper I described the figure as a " crudely drawn and linearized profile of a man grasping some object ", and I need add nothing here to that description. Fig. 59 is a reconstructed character, a " composite" integration of the two Figures 8 and 9 (omitting the object held) on Plate VII of " Pict. Reeonn.", part viii. Of these, Fig. 8 omits the foot, and Fig. 9 discards the head, but retains the foot. We are entitled, therefore, to infer an original form 1 Cited also by Takada in K.C.V., ch. 55, p. 3. J HAS. JULY 1020. JJ7</page><page sequence="19">574 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN as shown in Fig. 59. As will be seen, this differs only from Type 10 by the presence of the foot, the explicit restoration of which is probably here and elsewhere meant to show that the man is moving. Type 12 This appears to be the last figure amplified by a fully developed head with hair. It has become tho 181st" Radical " of Kanghsi, and is there said to be pronounced hsieh, but in modern use has lost the rough breathing and is sounded yeh. The Shuo Wen defines the word as " head ", and as a Determinative of many characters, it agrees with that meaning. Kanghsi is very curt in its treatment of this character, for after citing the alleged pronunciation according to three earlier dictionaries, and the Shuo Wen's entry, the Editors confine themselves to adding from the Liu Shu Ku (" Six Scripts "). that the character is gf shou and ought not to be pronounced hsieh, and that the Shuo Wen was wrong in making it a separate Radical with a different sound. The normal type is well and clearly shown in the inscription on the four-handled lui (or chiu as Mr. Yctts suggests it should be read) of the Kumorfopoulos collection, where in combination it appears twice (see Fig. 00 on Plate). This is an already much stylized rendering of Type 3 (modern )\J) surmounted by a variant of the human head and hair, disproportionately drawn for the sake of emphasis, but intended to give a profile view. We may remark two things of this type, first that so far in archaic Chinese it never occurs as an independent character ; and second that it differs only from the archaic forms of ^ chien, to perceive, by having j|j shou, head, where chien has (=} mu, eye. TvrE 13 Under one group are here brought together outlines of the human figure in profile, whether standing or kneeling, but all having the head, one or both arms, with hands or a hand,</page><page sequence="20">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 575 and the foot also indicated. What word may be meant seems uncertain, but the native scholars, judging by the general nature of the brief inscriptions containing them, usually treat them as being ad hoe varieties of the character for son, viz, , J- tzii. Perhaps in most cases they are right, for it is hard to find a more likely solution. A curious chance has brought on to the same page of Wu Ta-ch'eng's ICo Ghai Chi Ku Lu,1 the two examples numbered Figs. 61 and 62 on the Plate. I should mention as regards Fig. 61 that in his Supplement, the Ku Ghou P'ien Pu I, chiian 3, p. 15, Takada cites the form, but shows close to the head and partly above it, a crudely drawn ^ ko or halberd, and treats the two as forming one group, adding, " a man beneath a halberd and with hands hanging down,?this is ;$ shu, frontier guard, not flfc fa, to attack." He may perhaps be right. Type 14 No one, probably, looking at the modern shape of the character J^ shen, body, nor perhaps at the Lesser Seal version, S, would detect a human model. Yet it is there, and not so far to seek, in many of tho archaic designs, such for instance as are seen in Figs. 63 to 65. All except the Shuo Wen agree that in one way or another these old forms represent the human figure with the belly emphasized, while there is incomplete agreement as to the lower diagonal, or short cross stroke. Fig. 65 seems very convincing that Takada has rightly interpreted the forms as intended to represent a pregnant woman, the contained dot or line suggesting the foetus, and corresponding with the expression in the spoken language /fj* J^ yu shen " having body ", that is, being pregnant. But the lower cross or diagonal stroke has caused more doubt. I do not see how it can be phonetic as the Shuo Wen supposes, nor does it seem happily described, as it is by Wieger, as " a leg moving forward to 1 Ts'S 1&gt;M, p. 17.</page><page sequence="21">576 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN keep the equilibrium ". My own explanation is quite different. I believe it to be a conventional device, or written gesture, " stop here," as it were, meant to direct the attention to what is immediately above, viz. the pregnant body, as being the key to the significance of the character, and the sense of the word. Type 15 The discovery of this type is due to the Honan Relics, and unless I am deceived, the discovery also provides the earlier form, and the explanation, of the character &lt;ffc tui, now used for " exchange", but interchanged with '|# yiieh, joy, gladness, and some other of its compounds, in the older literature. The four Figs. GO to 09, all from the Honan bones, arc, I believe, variants of this type. They represent a human figure, with a head variously modified and abridged, holding in one hand what seems to be either a rod, or more probably some form of weapon. Fig. GO occurs on the remarkable Dcershorn " sceptre " now in the British Museum. It should be compared with Fig. 67, where the upper part or head of the figure is essentially the same, but the axis is directed upwards instead of to the left. Fig. 68 is again an abridgment of an abridgment, so that the head is reduced to the mouth. Fig. 69 has the head of a devil (see under Type 7), and is conceivably not a variant of this type, but a separate character, perhaps \? wei. Now what is the significance of Figs. GO and 07, and especially, what is the uppermost part intended to signify ? I interpret the latter as a head, contracted, as often, to a mouth, from which issues, in a kind of megaphonic outline, a symbol of the human voice. The two together represent, it is reasonable to suppose, an effort to express the human voice uttering sounds of gladness and loud noise (which are deemed by many to be the same thing). If this be granted, we have, almost exactly in Fig. 07, the prototype of the later ^? tui, in its sense of gladness, the only objection that might</page><page sequence="22">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 577 be urged being that the two small upper strokes?the sides of the megaphone?should, in the later developments of the character, have sloped outwards, thus V/ not J\. But this is not a very serious difficulty. Moreover, certain further archaic characters, also occurring on the Honan bones, and published in Lo Chen-yii's work, Yin Hsu Shu Ch'i, seem clearly to be rather ampler variants of the main or right-hand half of the figures discussed above, and therefore, as I submit, to be early forms of jfc tui. Not that Lo himself took that view of them, for he includes them (on p. 2) in his collection of characters awaiting investigation.1 Nor can I claim tho concurrence of the Japanese scholar, Takada Tadasuke, who surmises that they represent the modern character gjj chfui, to blow or breathe out. But however it may be regarding the equation of these figures with modern characters, what appears certain is the identity of type, despite the variations of detail, of Figs. 70 to 72, with the main part of the four discussed above, Figs. 66 to 69. Here are the same merging of the whole head into a mouth, the same childlike symbol of a something issuing from the mouth, noise, words, mere breath, whatever it may be, the same linear abridgment of body, arm, and leg, that we saw before. The only difference is that in the absence of any object to be grasped, the forearm and hand are economized and omitted. Type 16 The identification of this archaic form as the true original of the element ^ in the Lesser Seal, and f?* in modern writing, which constitutes the main body of the characters ^g lao, old and $% k'ao, aged, we owe to the insight of Mr. Takada. He detected it in the form Fig. 73, equivalent to the rare modem character &lt;g tieh, very old. The Shuo Wen, analysing the Lesser Seal version, treats the upper part as 5g mao, hair, as indeed it seems to be, 1 Sec his J)# [,f? vtf $2 f? [ig U| Yin Hsil Shu Ch'i Tai Win Pien.</page><page sequence="23">578 THE HUMAN FIGURE IN though why hair, or long hair, should be deemed characteristic of old age is not clear, unless the long eyebrows of old age are suggested. Notice again that the arm, normally even in the archaic script left without a hand, here terminates in that organ, seemingly due to the presence of another element to the left. It will not seem perhaps clear to ordinary readers why there should be cause for the special congratulations now offered by a fellow-student to the devoted Japanese epigraphist to whose acumen the above discovery is due. Type 17 The character ^ or g wang, to face, to look towards, does not appear likely to furnish a member of the scries of types with which this paper is concerned. Yet, in fact, it does so, Kanghsi, quoting from the Yil P'ien Dictionary, gives a form ||e, and calls it the " ancient character " for Sg wang. But both Chalmers and Wieger insert the form as ~ Jg ch'en.1 But the Shuo Wen gives (under its radical 3r t'wy) a Cesser Seal form consisting similarly of g ch'en over ^? t'ing, but asserts it to be an " ancient form of g^ wang, contracted ". The Honan bones, again, supply us with the archaic parent of Kanghsi's " ancient form ", and of the Shuo Wen's ancient form also, in the guise of Fig. 74, where the lower half is a primitive scription of f? t'ing (itself an integrated compound of man standing erect on ground, -J^ t'u). But these same relics also display, and in the same contexts, a still simpler form, Fig. 75, where man alone remains and the ground is absent; and consequently, no longer earth-bound, he claims his due place in this paper,?for sic itur ad astra. Now it might not unreasonably be objected that these two* supposed variants may be two quite separate characters. Indeed, I harboured this doubt myself until I found that both occur in the same locution, shown in Fig. 70. The second 1 Structure of Chinese Characters, p. 72 and p. 136. Chinese Characters (Eng. edition), p. 208.</page><page sequence="24">ARCHAIC CHINESE WRITING 579 character of this is peculiar to the Honan relics. It is a strange formation. Takada, perhaps following Wang Kuo-wei, decides that it stands for jjfc chfeng, to mount. But I am convinced that the true equation was discovered by the late Mr. Flank Chalfant, who saw in it the original of the modern character ^p hsing, fortunate chance, stroke of good luck. And a strong and indeed convincing argument in favour of Chalfant's view is that while ?{j[ jjg wang chyeng is hard to make sense of, ?g =$* wang hsing is a known phrase meaning to expect or hope for the arrival of the imperial chariot.1 But to return to Fig. 75. As we have seen, the lower part is \ jen, man, surmounted by (5 clCen, minister, which, according to the Shuo Wen, " depicts bowing in compliance/* Mk M ffli tZ. M hsiang ch'ii fu chih hsing. I have dis believed this for many years, and Fig. 75 seems to justify this scepticism, and to show that we have in g clCen a stylized and abridged human head in profile. Thus the whole composite exhibited in Fig. 75 would be strictly analogous with Q clCien, to perceive?man surmounted by eye?and would represent a man looking towards some personage or object. Such a design would be natural and appropriate for a word with the sense of looking towards, whether with or without the addition of the ground element. Rkfekkncks Works quoted in this article.
