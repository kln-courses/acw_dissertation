Tara Hamling’s Decorating the “Godly” Household will be your knowledge- able guide through the architectural wings of mostly upper middle class homes that were open to guests in the period but are infrequently sought out by present-day visi- tors. These rooms come instantly to life, the pictorial vividness of their—supposedly illicit—biblical Protestant decor animated by Hamling’s lively presentation. She but- tresses these in situ interpretations with clearly presented information about the  private daily life of the devout English family within the larger iconoclastic bounds of official doctrine.  In the same homes a complementary curatorial talk is taking place.

It’s worth cocking an ear while the two guides are in the same room, for you’ll receive a commentary on some of the same objects and spaces fromdifferent disciplinary perspectives. Consid- ering these volumes as a pair also throws into relief the advantages and challenges of these perspectives.  Hamling and Frye both rescue fragile, though persistent, media from the criti- cal periphery, placing them in a rich and engaging cultural context. They emphasize these media as mutually informing cultural expressions: middle- and lower-class  architecture and fixed architectural décor; stitched, carved, plastered, etched, and painted Protestant narratives from the Hebrew Bible; exquisite forerunners of artists’ books; textile portraits; women’s needlework samplers; poetry and epic written by women; and more. Following Tessa Watt’s lead, both consider the way that Continental printed imagery served as a source for these other media, and they rightly celebrate the variety and freshness of their materials. Both bring new textual and material details to light. Considering the two books together, we see how sensitively Frye reads the nuances of Innogen’s bedroom décor in Cymbeline. Or we see Hamling thinking through the impact made by embroidered images in particular locations: “What did it mean to sit on or prop the body against an image of Christ?” she asks about tapestry seat cushions before speculating that they were only brought out for show (213).  We also see that Pens and Needlesmight benefit from an occasional step back from its predominantly secular and feminist framework. Could early modern women have also used narratives such as the story of David and Bathsheba to explore their own sensual desires and interests, as well as (necessarily oppressive?) male desire? How might a more nuanced account of needlework as religious meditation, briefly de- scribed by Hamling, complicate the book’s socio-political arguments? And likewise, Decorating the “Godly” Householdmight enhance its readings with stricter attention to early modern reading practices, to gender (the book considers “man” an ungendered collective), or to integral nonreligious design elements. What about the semiotics of, say, a strawberry pattern on a ceiling decorated with religious imagery? Yet both books’ synthesis of extensive archival work and meticulous presentation productively com- plicate our evolving understanding of early modern English material studies through issues of class, religion, gender, and performance.   Those familiar with recent scholarship on the Reformation’s destruction of visual im- ages will recognize that Hamling opens with a straw-man argument—that Protes- tantism brought optical drought—only to quickly smash it. That householders commonly displayed illustrations from the Hebrew Bible due to the “Protestant avoidance of potentially idolatrous images from the New Testament” has become a commonplace—indeed, this is a quotation from Frye’s book (137). What Decorating the “Godly” Household offers instead is a much more nuanced understanding of what kinds of imagery appeared in the homes of the gentry, in what specific physical and </page> <page sequence="3"> review | early modern women’s textiles    327 ideological contexts and at what dates, and for which ends. This imagery includes plenty of scenes from the Hebrew Bible, but Hamling reads them with a sensitivity to shifting religious policy and the domestic context. The first chapter offers a lucid overview of the placement, use, and appearance of religious images from 1400 to 1660, and the Protestant doctrinal challenges to these as the Reformation unfolded in his- tory and space. Anyone teaching Continental or English art of the early modern  period would find this section of the book useful. Particularly striking among the book’s nearly two hundred reproductions are a moderate number of New Testament images, accompanied by learned speculation about their presence. Some present-day private Scottish or English homes have incorporated these features but are unavailable for public viewing—a circumstance conditioning the timely import of this study. The wealthy but devout Protestant faced a challenge when selecting the décor for a home: how to display the wealth proper to his (and sometimes her) rank and so- cial aspirations, while at the same time demonstrating modesty and doctrinal adher- ence. During most of the period, the injunction against images remained in effect for spaces of worship but did not fully extend to the domestic sphere. Biblical imagery in the home served to negotiate the householder’s conflicting desires. The possession of earthly goods and riches was considered acceptable as long as they promoted god - liness; domestic biblical imagery was deemed appropriate as long as it could be con- sidered didactic rather than devotional in function, and therefore not susceptible to worship. The particular media, location, and “narrative fidelity” of such images be- came key factors. The faithful seemed less likely to worship an image drawn from the Hebrew Bible on a dinner plate, bed post, or seat cushion than they were a painting or “an embossed and gilt Image” (49; citing the 1563 Elizabethan “Homily against peril of idolatry”) of a solo New Testament figure like the Virgin Mary or the crucified Christ at eye level. Imagery of a more questionable kind might still be slipped in through the back door, so to speak, in several ways. Guiding texts might be included in the image or lo- cated in a frequently used related printed book. Texts might also replace the problem- atic image altogether, like the Tetragrammaton instead of an anthropomorphic God. Images might be “toned down,” that is, accompanied by minimal adornment, or pre- sented in a muted color scheme, or executed in cheap materials. Ambiguity served similar ends: for example, the green delftware-plate dove of the Holy Spirit flapping above the nimbed risen Christ, as if “it could simply be any bird, perhaps a duck, flying overhead” (207). Context made all the difference, like the portrait collection camou- flaging a potentially shocking portrait of Christ in the Hampton Court Palace Gallery, or an image positioned high up or awkwardly, where the viewer could see it only with difficulty. Suspect imagery does slip into Hamling’s own book; nonreligious elements such as large grotesques, classical scenes, or local flora and fauna, in addition to texts, deserve more attention. Here Frye supplies a useful perspective, quoting Holland Cot- ter: “Ornament, usually regarded as the equivalent of background music, is essential to creating a coherent visual universe” (cited 172). If “decorative art was never experienced </page> <page sequence="4">    328 erika boeckeler in isolation but as part of the collection of objects, images and textures that made up the furnishings of a room, or suite of rooms, within a particular house” (Hamling, 10), treating the integration of these images would lend an additional dimension to the book’s excellent readings. New Testament “imagery” most commonly made its appearance under the guise of a scene from the Hebrew Bible, with some scenes far more popular than  others. The most frequently depicted image, the Sacrifice of Isaac, of course referred to the Crucifixion. This typological model is useful but silent on the visual tradition(s) out of which favored types emerged. Hamling’s readings stress the Protestant emphasis on biblical narrative and narrative fidelity as a crucial, legitimizing feature; such read- ings would be enhanced by interrogating what “narrative fidelity” actually meant to early modern Protestant readers, whose wide range of interpretive practices inspired hot debates about the proper goals and methods of Protestant reading (James Simp- son’s Burning to Read comes to mind). Interpretive strategies such as scrupulous atten- tion to narrative detail might readily topple typological equivalencies, as the author’s conclusion points out ultimately did happen after the book’s focus period. The literal and figurative centerpiece of Hamling’s book is chapter 4, which shares a title with the monograph but substitutes “Protestant” for the awkward “godly.” The reader encounters the home’s spaces in the order that a guest would have—hall, parlor, staircase, great chamber, bedchamber, gallery—and in her finely nuanced ac- count, the imagery of each space is shown to be appropriate to its function. For exam- ple, guests processed through the hall, conversed in the parlor, ascended “spiritually” on the staircase, admired the great chamber as they dined, noted the carved bedstead in the bedchamber, and leisurely promenaded among the portraits under the gallery’s decorated ceiling. The previous two chapters have prepared readers for this tour in two distinct ways: one outlines the technical innovations that led to the subdivision of  internal space, making specialized functions possible, and the other describes the  day-to-day devotional activities occurring in those spaces, as suggested by printed spiritual guides from the period. The chapter-long tour concludes with an extensive commentary on movables like tableware and textiles, and on the cupboards that contained them—almost a  postscript but fascinating enough to stand on its own. Two subsequent chapters treat  imagery in especially significant locations, namely, the center of family life—the hearth—and the decorated ceilings of the gallery. While both chapters provide engag- ing readings, Hamling’s theory of the psychological effects of viewing images on the ceiling is especially illuminating. Like the protective ritual objects buried inside early modern home structures, the scores of watchful eyes in the high ceilings may have of- fered a sense of comfort, but they may have also observed and censured bad behavior.   Susan Frye’s Pens and Needlesweaves its argument in a chiasmus of pens and needles to support its convincing claim that early modern women perceived and practiced the </page> <page sequence="5"> review | early modern women’s textiles    329 two as “interlocking media” (5). Frye offers a corrective to the assumed separation of the male-gendered pen and the female-gendered needle, a binary she argues has hand- icapped scholarship since at least the early nineteenth century. The book begins with the tightly interwoven writing and needlework in Elizabeth Tudor’s New Year’s gifts and Mary Stuart and Bess of Hardwick’s collaborations, moving through a slightly looser interconnection of early “artists’ books” and the textile production of profes- sionally trained female artists to that of the amateur needleworker, and ending with the treatment of textiles in writing by and about women, specifically in two Shakespeare plays and in Lady Mary Wroth’s epic, Urania. Frye’s very loose definition of “needles” (“the entire continuum of early modern women’s relations to textiles, from the most basic carding and spinning of thread, laundering, mending, and sewing, to the complex textile production embodied in skilled needlework” [13]) allows her to en- compass a wide range of objects and texts, on which her focus is anything but loose. With early modern women as its subject and an interdisciplinary approach, Pens and Needles adds a significant voice to the host of recent noteworthy publications, such as Michelle M. Dowd’s Women’s Work in Early Modern English Literature and Culture, Pamela S. Hammons’ Gender, Sexuality, and Material Objects in English Renaissance Verse, and Margaret P. Hannay’s biography of Lady Mary Sidney Wroth. Among the most striking of Frye’s contributions is the interpretive energy gen- erated through extended attention to the very small. Stitch by stitch, penstroke by pen- stroke, women created a world in miniature, all the while interacting to shape the larger one in which they actually lived. The sewn samplers described in chapter 3, often depicting Genesis scenes, served such a generative function: they might contain an al- phabet beside a sewn glossary of all kinds of stitches and images that would be used later in an infinite variety of more specialized productions. The scale of her focus is it- self very much in keeping with the Renaissance concept multum in parvo, the sense that “the smallest spaces are more replete, and thus symbolically larger” (Jessica Wolfe, cited 78). With chapter 3 as a fulcrum, the book itself moves generally from small to large, from lyric and sonneteering to epic. Although its critical energies lie elsewhere, it sidesteps an opportunity to say something big about the lyric form and its economies of space, which many female writers and embroiderers play with. Pens and Needles is at its best when it first sorts out the smalls from their cumulative effects.  Frye appropriately showcases early on discoveries likely to have the most im- mediate critical impact: Bess of Hardwick’s textile portrait of Mary Stuart and the textual identification of Elizabeth’s now lost 1544 New Year’s gift-book to her father, King Henry VIII, as Erasmus’s Dialogus fidei. The former appears in the context of Mary’s demonstrated predilection for the white mourning veil and coverings, the deuil blanc, in representations of herself, a point she comments on in her own writ- ing and that is also noted in writings about her. As Bess of Hardwick’s “prisoner” under house arrest, Mary and her remarkable designer-jailor collaborated on an enor- mous number of needlework projects. In that context it is very plausible that the tex- tile portrait of Mary, wearing the deuil blanc and labeled allegorically as “Chastity,” </page> <page sequence="6">    330 erika boeckeler should appear in the same appliquéd hanging as the larger Lucretia, who is one of the many figures promoting Bess of Hardwick in the Notable Women of the Ancient World tapestry series at her New Hardwick Hall. A reproduction of this textile image graces the book’s cover.  The section on Elizabeth Tudor introduces the cipher, a figure that informs the treatment of many subsequent written and sewn phenomena. The pre-teen daughter of King Henry VIII and stepdaughter of Queen Katherin Parr sewed a cipher of alpha- betic letters grounded in a large H (for Henry) on the cover of her 1544 New Year’s gift- books. Hovering between linguistic legibility and non-linguistic arabesque, the enchained letters offer Frye a way to tease out that dynamic. Elizabeth has sewn the let- ters onto each other with “lover’s knots” that Frye links to the ingratiating purposes of the gift itself: “they form . . . designs that celebrate the tension between separation and joining”; “the letters . . . are individually distinguishable and bound together” (37). True to the pens-and-needles chiasmus, Frye relates them to the penned knots in Eliz- abeth’s signatures and more intimate letter writing. In Frye’s reading of the cipher, the initials for the names Henry, Katherin, Parr, Elizabeth, Edward, Rex, Regina, and Mary can be discerned. That other readers of these letters and knots have found similar but alternative interpretations—for example, the full names Henry and Katherin—points to the way that the cipher must always frustrate reading because of its status as an image. Such an uncertain position on the brink of literacy is sometimes wildly productive—as with Othello’s successful rhetorical manipulation of the handkerchief ’s embroidered strawberry pattern, which Frye considers in chapter 4—and sometimes simply im - penetrable, as the enormous start-up costs to access the “sibylline” cipher writing of Jane Segar in chapter 2 show.  In chapter 2, Frye places the material productions of three early modern female professionals, including Segar, on a continuum. The three create elaborate and materi- ally valuable texts and images to capture or maintain the patronage of the (mostly) fe- male monarchs. Court miniaturist Levina Teerlinc adapts male religious iconography and ritual traditions for female monarchs; by reading this work, Frye introduces the small-scale intensity of Segar and Esther Inglis as similar attempts to establish inti- macy. Segar creates a visually striking manuscript with English and coded “transla- tions” of sibylline writing as a way to curry favor with Elizabeth I: “The entire volume works to connect Segar with Elizabeth I through the sibyls,” emblems of their shared virginal status and prophetic female power (88). The painted glass of the cover (verre églomisé) apparently replaces a portrait of Elizabeth with cryptic characters taken from Timothy Bright’s Characterie: An Art of Swift and Secret Writing (1588). Inside, Segar “others” the text through color (the English appears in gold ink), script, format- ting (English appears on the left to blur the original/translation binary), reading direc- tion (the cipher reads vertically), and textual opacity. With more sustained attention to these formal strategies for establishing intimacy, this chapter’s argument might be yet more persuasive. The considerable visual and intellectual engagement Segar’s text an- ticipates from her intended reader also features in Esther Inglis’s miniature master- pieces of harmonized needlework, calligraphy, and illumination. </page> <page sequence="7"> review | early modern women’s textiles    331 A second, related feature characterizing the work of these three women is per- formance and performativity. Although it is not a dominant argument, Frye touches on this aspect in the work of all three, as with Teerlinc’s miniature in its relation to ac- tual performances or Inglis’s work as it acts toward “a profound disruption of the usual male-controlled forms of textual production at the turn of the seventeenth century” (110). This insistence on a male sexed and gendered press, relying also on an unduly strict separation between print and manuscript practices, tends to flatten the readings here. A stronger emphasis on Inglis’s combined visual and verbal craftsmanship and artistry would have brought to the fore the book’s larger exploration of the harmoniz- ing work of the hand across media, as well as the importance of decades of develop- ments in virtuosic calligraphy throughout the closely related printing and penning worlds. Born of Continentally trained Huguenot refugee parents, Inglis was heiress to the groundbreaking work of the published penmanship masters Giovannantonio Taglienti and Ludovico degli Arrighi, the influential Giovanni Battista Palatino, and the small- or large-scale “artists’ book” treasures of Europe, which inspired pre - dominantly male imitators. Frye points out in an earlier source article for this chapter that Inglis knew some of this work. Despite these oversights, the section on Inglis of- fers a wealth of observations on the challenges of marketing and production that were faced by the female artist and author in the period. After an outstanding third chapter on depictions of female figures from the He- brew Bible in native textiles, the book turns to canonical literary texts. The treatment of clothing more generally, rather than the material interconnectedness of writing and sewing, broadens the argument but also relaxes it. The section on Innogen’s disguises in Shakespeare’s Cymbeline and the chapter on Wroth’s Urania partially reprise the in- troduction’s less balanced approach to the Alice Barnham portrait: writing and sewing are so ubiquitous and so multivalent that the copulative conjunction of the title can lose its force. Early modern English women who knew how to write wore clothes, tended to sew, and wrote about clothing. To an extent, the unraveling of this copulative knot is Frye’s point. Her last chapter on the first romance epic written in English by a woman explores the feminist implications of thinking about Urania as a Penelopean textile, the loose threads of its plotlines prompted by references to clothing. This con- clusion, made about and through dilation, fittingly closes an interdisciplinary book working within a complex tapestry of literary studies, art history, social history, feminist studies, and material studies. The interrelated fields of material studies and book history both grapple with the fundamental question of what the material object means for thinking about tex- tuality and object-ness. What is the relation of physical form to the medium of lan- guage? Put more generally, how do we understand the relation of physical form and the processes of its creation as these both connect to the cognitive processes of the mind-producing-language? How can we think more sensitively about cultures, their stratifications, and cultural products by engaging “The Material” in this way? Scholarly work, such as that appearing along with Pens and Needles in the University of Penn- sylvania Press’s Material Texts series, has shown that unlocking these connections </page> <page sequence="8">    332 erika boeckeler will both open up new reading practices and reinvigorate the social and historical questions about gender, sexuality, class, nationhood, and religion (to name a few) that have frequently guided literary-critical inquiry in early modern traditions.    erika boeckeler teaches English at Northeastern University.
