Quite possibly he will attain, here and there, a vantage point from which the highway itself may be viewed in a new perspective. The highway itself and the world through which it leads may be glimpsed from a bypath that in itself leads nowhere. The relation between the doctrines of Descartes and Spinoza is a matter of continued re-interpretation. The extremes of opponent interpretations can be easily characterized. On the one hand, Spinozism is defined as a revised and systematized Cartesianism. On the other hand, the relation of the former to the latter may be regarded as extrinsic rather than essential; Spinoza, it may be urged, employed Cartesianism in order to facilitate the expression of a radically different philosophical vision. These opposed views concerning the relation of the two philosophies emerged quite promptly after Spinoza's works became accessible. The settlement of the question was not a matter of merely academic and historical interest. It was rather a matter of living importance. The exciting controversial issues of the day borrowed weapons from one or the other philosophy. The philosophic defense of theology was at issue. Materialism was in process of formulation. Empiricism was com- ing to the continent from Britain. If the doctrines of Descartes and Spinoza were essentially one in spirit, they could be evaluated in a single process. But, if similarity of expression, and to some extent 46i</page><page sequence="2">462 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. of idea, masked a profound difference of meaning, the contro- versial situation was doubly complicated. The philosophic defense of theology, it was remarked above, was involved in the Descartes-Spinoza issue. The question of the rela- tion of the later to the earlier philosophy received intensity of treatment because of controversial associations. In the course of a century an extraordinary transformation occurred. The Carte- sian philosophy, in a word, became the foundations for the refuta- tion of Spinozism. To demonstrate the incompatibility of the two philosophies was the first step. The second, and important step, once this incompatibility had been established, was to employ Cartesian doctrine for the refutation of Spinoza. To insist upon the essential harmony of the two philosophies, to emphasize their kin- ship, was to infect Cartesianism with the horrors of Spinozism. In that measure Cartesianism was unavailable for the purposes of apologetics. To separate the philosophies was, then, the necessary preliminary. The second step, however, the basing of the refuta- tion of Spinozism upon Cartesian doctrine, in itself reflects a trans-, formation effected by the passing of decades. After all, the earliest reactions to Cartesianism were not wholly unlike the earliest reactions to Spinozism. The Cartesian philoso- phy appeared as the doctrine of a novateur. Here and there it was suspected of a secret harmony with Protestantism. On the whole, however, Protestant and Catholic theologians alike were doubtful of Cartesianism's utility for apologetical purposes. In the later case of Spinoza, the question of apologetical employment scarcely arose. Occasionally there appeared a defense of Spinoza against the charge of atheism. In the main, however, the refutation of him became a favorite exercise of piety. The horror aroused by Spinozism is an historical commonplace. All fears born of new ideas, whatever their kind and origin, were concentrated upon it. Those who were alarmed by Deism pointed to Spinoza as its chief proponent. For the self-appointed guardians of society against ma- terialism and atheism, Spinozism was recognized as the chief fortress of the enemy. A striking bit of evidence of the emotional intensity involved-and it is perhaps also evidence of the power of Spinozism-is found in the belittling of the enemy's doctrine.</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 463 Gerdil astonishes us by disparaging the philosophy he is at such pains to refute. The "absurdities" of this impie novateur are said to shock common sense; and Gerdil solemnly asserts that there is no philosophy whatever that does not supply a sufficiency of principles with which to combat these absurdities.1 Gerdil's statement, that any philosophy whatever would serve for the refutation of Spinozism, renders all the more interesting the selection of Cartesianism for the purpose. The significant fact is that, in the interval between the dissemination of Cartesian doctrine and the appearance of Spinozism, Cartesianism had be- come the ally of piety and the intellectual arsenal of theology. The defense of Descartes turns out to be equivalent to the refutation of Spinoza. At the same time, the refutation of Spinoza is the overthrow of 'atheism,' and 'materialism'. Thus the earlier novateur becomes the bulwark of defense against the later and more dreaded innovator. Cartesian doctrine, once viewed so widely as a threat to religious and theological interests, Protestant and Catholic alike, had become adjusted to the uses of apologetics. Descartes becomes the defender of the faith. In the face of the new adversary the opposition to Descartes was liquidated. After all, as Gerdil indi- cates, the defense against innovation must depend either upon the Scholastic philosophy or upon Descartes. The enmity between the School and the Cartesians, however, simplified the choice. The net outcome, in brief, was this: the polemic against Deism, material- ism, atheism, and ethical naturalism, must take Cartesianism as its arsenal, or else there would be no modern armament at all for the polemic. Cousin has called attention to this transformation of the role of Cartesianism. In I755, he writes, the French Academy discussed l'esprit philosophique. The essay that won the prize eulogized Des- cartes because of this twofold service to philosophy, the freeing of thought from the yoke of Aristotle, and his service to the cause 1 Cardinal Gerdil (I7i8-i8o2): Receuil de Dissertations vur quelques prin- cipes de philosophic et de religion, Par le R.

It is perhaps worth while to quote a few lines from the lengthy selection given by Cousin :2 Disciple de la lumiere, au lieu d'interroger les morts et les dieux de 1'ecole, il ne consulta que les idees claires et distinctes, la nature et 1'evidence. Par des meditations profondes, il tira toutes les sciences du chaos, et par un coup de genie plus grand encore il montra le secours mutuel qu'elles doivent se prkter; il les enchaina toutes en- semble, les eleva les unes sur les autres; et se plagant ensuite sur cette hauteur, il marcha, avec toutes les forces de l'esprit humain ainsi rassemblees, 'a la decouverte de ces grandes verites que d'autres plus heureux sont venus enlever apres lui, mais en suivant les sentiers de lumiere que Descartes avoit traces. Ce fut donc le courage et la fierte d'un seul esprit qui causerent dans les sciences cette heureuse et memorable revolution, dont nous gofitons auj ourdhui les avantages avec une superbe ingratitude. II falloit aux sciences un homme qui osat conjurer tout seul avec son genie contre les anciens tyrans de la raison; qui osat fouler aux pieds ces idoles que tant de siecles avoient adorees. Descartes se trouvoit enferme dans le labyrinth avec tous les autres philosophes; mais il se fit lui-meme des ailes, et il s'envola, frayant ainsi une route nouvelle a la raison captive. Cousin then asks: "Qui pronongait en I755 ces fortes paroles? fltait-ce un professeur de l'Universite de Paris, devangant et sur- passant son confrere Thomas dans son Rloge de Descartes? ou bien encore quelque ardent disciple de l'Oratoire ou de Port-Royal? Non: c'est un pere jesuite, le pere Antoine Guenard." Descartes' efforts to placate Jesuit opposition were not, after all, unavailing. To Guenard and to others, Descartes had become the defender of the faith. It is evident that the resulting situation was intricate. Because of the association of Cartesianism with the defense of theology, it was necessary to insist upon the diversity of the two philosophies. The points of diversity must be specified. On the other hand, granted the diversity of doctrine, the refutation of Spinozism by means of Cartesianism must pivot upon these points which were, at one and the same time, viewed as the points of greatest diversity and also as fundamental in the Cartesian philosophy. In this way the essentials of Cartesianism-at any rate the essentials as com- prehended by the controversialists-receive definition by the con- troversial situation itself and the controversy is reciprocally de- 'V.

The refutations of Spinozism by means of Cartesianism, accordingly, reflect the discoveries effected within Cartesianism by apologetic interests. The pillorying of Spinoza as atheist and ma- terialist may or may not be informing with respect to the spirit and intention of Spinozism; but it furnishes insight into the specu- lative interests of the age. The Cartesian refutations of Spinoza are highly revealing. They express one way in which Cartesian doctrine became an historical force. They indicate, not, perhaps, what Descartes intended to emphasize, but what some of his fol- lowers discovered to be vital in his doctrine. II GERDIL ON THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE PRINCIPLES OF DESCARTES AND SPINOZA The worthy Gerdil3 may be selected, somewhat at random, to illustrate the first step in the refutation of Spinoza drawn from Cartesian sources-namely, the demonstration of the 'incompati- bility' of the principles sponsored by the one and the other. Gerdil is not unaware of the history of the Cartesian movement. The system, he admits, alarmed both the believer and the unbeliever. Of the first importance is the fact that it had undermined the older support of apologetics. The "School" had effected the reconcilia- tion of philosophy and dogma. But Cartesianism overthrew the very principles upon which this pretended reconciliation had been based. From this an erroneous conclusion had been drawn, to wit, that Descartes himself would have none of these dogmas. This had aroused hostility towards Descartes, and Gerdil states that a whole group of "ecrivains licensieux" had proceeded to attack his phi- losophy. Interestingly enough, Gerdil states that this reaction to Descartes was intensified by the belief that the philosophy of Spinoza was the "funeste consequence" of the Cartesian teaching. In contrast with this group, Gerdil admits, there is another party; the latter regarded the Cartesian principles as in themselves favora- ble to the cause of religion. But even this sympathetic group are disturbed by the conviction that Spinozism was somewhat mys- teriously generated by the Cartesian system. Gerdil does not make 8 See note I.</page><page sequence="6">466 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. clear to us the source of this conviction. Perhaps the sympathetic felt that Descartes had been reckless in his proclamation of the competence of reason. Guenard, in the eulogy of the philosophical spirit referred to above, distinguished two essential aspects of the philosophical spirit, the one a complete independence of every au- thority save that of reason in the order of philosophy, the other a respect for faith in the order of supernatural truths; and Guenard, as Cousin states, cited Cartesianism as the model of the philosophi- cal spirit so conceived.4 Complete independence in the order of philosophy, however, might well lead the spirit of libertinage to a neglect of the truths of faith. The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus is scarcely to be compared with the Cartesian gestures towards dogma and homage to the Church. The Cartesian independence in the order of philosophy, it must have appeared to some, might well have generated Spinozism, and thus the Cartesian philosophy, de- spite its author's piety, may have led to atheism. In any case, Gerdil recognizes a widespread fear that Cartesian principles, despite their value for the cause of piety, were also manipulable in the interests of atheism.5 In the circumstances, Gerdil must undertake to calm the fears of those who suspect that Cartesian teaching leads to Spinozism and atheism. This is all the more necessary if the apologetical employment of Cartesian ideas is to be justified. The incompatibility of the two philosophies must be demonstrated.6 Atheism, Gerdil informs us, whether ancient or modern, always rests upon three principles. The first is the eternity of movement; the second, the absolute or metaphysical necessity of existence, whether of matter or of motion; and the third, the identity of thinking and material substance. Since he is quite convinced that Spinozism is atheism, we may depend upon him to discover, some- how, these three principles in Spinoza's system. To accomplish his purpose he must, in addition, prove that they are not discoverable ' Op. Cit. 4i8. ' Pp. 157-I6o; p. I98. Gerdil's dissertation, it should be noted, is directed against a certain "new examination of Spinozism," the author of which he does not mention by name. The author of this "examen," however, is guilty of this very confounding of the principles of Spinozism with those of Des- cartes. The writer has not been able to identify with certainty the work taken by Gerdil as the object of his attack. .Preface vi, vii. TPreface III.</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 467 in the Cartesian system. These two tasks once accomplished, the incompatibility of the systems will have been demonstrated. Of the three principles that have always defined an atheistic philosophy, there is one, asserts Gerdil, which constitutes the es- sential "venom" of the Spinozistic system.8 But Cartesianism is not atheistic at all. Not merely will the Cartesian system lack the three principles of atheism-it will comprise the very antithesis of the venomous principle as one of its fundamental ideas. This antithetical principle will indeed form a peculiarly beneficient property of the Cartesian system. This special opposition of prin- ciple will be central in showing the incompatibility of the two philosophies. What are these opponent principles? The venom in Spinozism is the definition of thought or spirit as a mode of mat- ter-in short, the denial of the Cartesian dualism of finite sub- stances. This is indeed somewhat startling: the disentanglement of Spinozism and Cartesianism is based upon the body-soul doc- trine. This is a striking illustration of the fact that, after Descartes, the point of departure for apologetics is the matter-spirit dualism. In forsaking Scholasticism as the reconciliation of philosophy and dogma, Cartesianism, and more specifically the characteristic dual- ism of Cartesianism, becomes the basis for a new procedure of reconciliation. Gerdil's claim, that Spinoza regards thought or spirit as merely a mode of matter, may astonish the reader. It was evidently the task of Gerdil to manipulate the doctrine of the attributes, thought and extension. The Spinozistic doctrine concerning thought and extension as attributes must be interpreted so as to result in the atheistic principle, the venomous principle, that thought is a mode of matter. Gerdil's proposal is as follows: Spinoza's teaching con- cerning substance cannot be reconciled with his doctrine of exten- sion unless substance and matter be identified. If this identification is necessary for Spinozism, then Spinozism is, of course, a ma- terialism. Moreover, Spinozistic materialism in its specific features will be characterized by its antithesis to the characteristic principles of the Cartesian philosophy. In contrast with the latter, Spinozism, whatever its verbal expression, must reduce thought to a mode of 8P. 2I5.</page><page sequence="8">468 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. extension or of matter. Spinozistic materialism is, of course, an atheism. But the Cartesian system is neither a materialism nor an atheism. Significantly, it is neither, precisely because the system as such is au fond a matter-spirit dualism. In this manner the incompatibility of the two systems is specifi- cally defined. Gerdil's argument in support of his contention de- pends upon breaking down the Spinozistic distinction between substance and attribute. Spinoza has ascribed to the so-called at- tribute of Extension certain essential properties. But these proper- ties are metaphysically ultimate. Gerdil does not call them trans- cendental, but it seems fair to regard them in this way. Extension, according to Spinoza, is immutable, indivisible; it is one and in- finite. But substance alone can possess these characters. They are indeed properties of Absolute Being, or, in theological terms, of God. It follows, accordingly, that extension cannot be consistently defined as an attribute of substance, but is rather substance itself. In Cartesian terms, if we may translate Gerdil's thought, extension is the constitutive attribute of matter; then, accepting Spinoza's characterization of extension at its face value, we must conclude that matter is the supreme reality of the system. Spinozism is materialism. Whatever in that system can be signified by 'thought' or 'spirit', at least this is true, that the terms signify modes of matter. Thought is a derivative of matter.9 It is noteworthy that Gerdil repudiates the notion that Spinozism resulted from the reduction of Cartesian finite substances to the status of attributes of a single substance. Obviously, he must do this or he cannot maintain his contention of the incompatibility of the systems. He urges that, whatever others may think, the Spinozistic system could not have been attained by uniting in a single substance, in the form of attributes, the two perfections that Descartes kept independently real as the finite substances, Thought and Extension, Spirit and Matter. Whatever the merits of Gerdil's argument, this much can be read between the lines: the Cartesian ontological dualism is, for Gerdil as for other Cartesians, not an hypothesis but a truth established with finality. The argument is reinforced, according to Gerdil, by the fact P. i9i and ff. Gerdil explains that Spinoza's atheism is the consequence of his three positions: first, that there cannot be two substances differing in essence; second, that one substance cannot be produced by another; and, third, that substance is infinite (2,5-2i6).</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.] CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 469 that Descartes maintained the separation of force and matter. Spinoza did not do this. The consequence is that Descartes can reaffirm the argument from motion to a prime mover, while his successor cannot. This auxiliary point indicates that Gerdil believes Spinoza's view of extension to be central to the system. In tech- nical expression, Gerdil's argument depends upon the concept of independence. This character of independence, equally for Des- cartes and Spinoza, is the mark of substance. The problem is to determine whether the concepts of independence in the two phi- losophies are identical. To estimate the validity of the claim that Spinozism is a necessary consequence of the earlier doctrine, Ger- dil urges that we must examine the idea of independence in terms of the various meanings that existence may possess. Existence may be per se, that is, existence in the proper sense of the term, imply- ing that all modes are determinations of a single subject. Again, by existence may be intended existence a se, implying existence from itself in the sense of independence of a productive cause.10 Independence thus possesses two meanings that must not be con- founded. Descartes' definition of substance preserves the distinc- tion of meanings. Substance as that which can be conceived by itself without reference to other things comprises only the idea of an existence proper to the nature of substance. It excludes the notion of the inherence of substance in another subject. Inde- pendence, as the character of substance for Descartes, does not confuse independence a subjects inhaesionis with independence ut a caucsa efficiente-a confusion of which Leibniz is guilty.11 Spinoza's failure to keep apart these two meanings is responsible for his errors. Spinoza, en definissant la substance, . . . renferme dans cette notion, sous les termes equivoques dont les sens se developpe dans les con- sequences qu'il en tire, l'idee d'une existence non-seulement propre, mais necessaire; exclut non-seulement 1'inherence de la substance dans un autre sujet, mais aussi la dependence qui convient 'a un effet par rapport a sa cause, &amp; en un mot toute idee de relation que la substance peut avoir a quelque autre chose que ce soit. Spinoza, par un sophisme qui ne pouvoit etre que l'effet d'une passion aveugle, conclut qu'une substance ne peut etre produite par une autre substance'. . .

XLVI. attribut precisement ce que Descartes entendoit par le mot de sub- stance. 12 The finite substances of Descartes are genuinely possessed of the mark of substance, for they do not inhere in a subject. They are not independent in the second sense, implying non-dependence on an efficient cause. Gerdil thinks it is absurd to regard things as dependent in the sense that they inhere in God as modifications. It would be equally absurd to suppose that souls and corporeal things are independent a se.13 These absurdities are characteristic of Spinozism and follow from the confusion of the two meanings of independence. From this it appears that Spinoza, unlike Des- cartes, is in a predicament. If substance implies both the per se and the a se, then to substance alone can be assigned unity, indivisi- bility, immutability, and infinity. If, further, extension possess these predicates-and, according to Gerdil, this is really Spinoza's doctrine, extension itself is a substance. Within the Spinozistic system, however, there can be but a single substance. The logical structure of Spinozism, then, implies the identification of substance and extension. All the "funestes consequences" follow. Spinozism is materialism. Spinoza, who said 'God or Substance or Nature', should have said 'God or Substance, or Nature or Matter'. The defense of Descartes against the charge of fathering Spinozism rests, in the end, upon contrasting conceptions of ex- tension. Descartes, Gerdil urges, did not identify space in the vulgar sense, or body, with extension. For him extension neces- sarily implies impenetrability, divisibility, and mobility. Extension is thus clothed with properties vulgarly regarded as belonging to body.'4 Descartes' thought is not that body can be reduced to three dimensions, but rather that these three dimensions cannot obtain without involving impenetrability and divisibility. Hence extension is the essence, the primitive fund, of body. According to the Car- tesan view, then, immutability and indivisibility are incompatible with the idea of extension. If Spinoza identifies God and extension, and this he must do if he accords to extension the properties of immutability and indivisibility, it follows that Spinoza is giving extension a meaning radically unlike that of Descartes.'5 Pp. i85-i86.

There are students of Descartes, Gerdil recognizes, who admit that Descartes was not an atheist, but who fear that his principles lead to atheism. But Cartesianism, Gerdil urges, destroys a fundamental article of atheism, that is, the denial of a distinction between a prime motor and matter. In support of his contention, Gerdil invites his reader to recall the state in which Descartes found "la Physique". Toutes les puissances que les corps ont d'agir les uns sur les autres, toutes leurs qualities sensibles etoient autant de vertus innees, sym- pathiques ou antipathiques, expultrices ou retentrices, destinies a pro- duire chaque effet en particulier. Descartes concut que ce pompeux etalage de qualities occultes ne s'etoit introduit dans la Physique, qu'a la faveur de l'ignorance du mechanism. II vit, ce que Boyle confirma depuis par mile experiences, que la nature ne fait jouer en effet que la mechanism dans la production des effets, oui l'on peut entrevoir en quelque sorte son procede. La simplicity de ses voies le persuada que ce procede devoit etre uniforme. I1 ne balanqa donc pas a rejetter les formes substantielles &amp; accidentelles de l'flcole, &amp; a leur substituer les affections mechaniques, la grosseur, la figure, le mouvement des particules d'une matiere homogene. Mais apres avoir rejette tout I'ap- pareil des formes &amp; des qualities occultes, il comprit qu'il ne pouvoit plus reconnoitre dans la matiere aucune vertu active proprement dite. . . . Ainsi les derniers pas de l'analyse physique venoient se reunir aux dernieres conclusions de la synthese metaphysique, pour depouiller la matiere de toutes les proprietes qui ne peuvent se deduire de l'etendue impenetrable; &amp; faire par consequent de la matiere un etre purement passif, incapable de contenir en lui-meme le principe du movement. D'oui l'on voit que la necessity d'un premier moteur distingue de la matiere, est comme le centre ou' vont se reunir tous les principes physiques &amp; metaphysiques de la Philosophie de Descartes.16 The Cartesian principle of the divisibility of matter destroys the atheism of Spinoza; for it disproves the ultimate reality of material substance. Gerdil attempts to augment his case by discovering inconsistency n'y a aucune repugnance a admettre une etendue infinie, immobile, indi- visible; &amp; qu'apres avoir adopted la notion de l'etendue etablie par les par- tisans de l'espace pur, il y ajofite une absurdity particuliere, qui est de l'ap- peller une etendue corporelle. Ainsi Spinosa ne peut etablir sa consequence qu'en renversant le principe sur lequel Descartes a rejette le vuide, &amp; fait consister 1'essence du corps dans l'etendue. Descartes n'a sofitenu l'im- possibilite du vuide, qu'en sofitenant que toute etendue est par la nature im- penetrable, divisible, mobile. Spinoza n'etablit sa doctrine qu'en supposant que l'etendue peut etre indivisible, immobile. La doctrine de Spinosa est donc directment oppose aux principes de Descartes." Pp. I9I-I92. 16Pp. I96-I98.</page><page sequence="12">472 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. within Spinoza's materialism. He charges that Spinoza admitted the conception of material particles or corpuscles. But this is hope- lessly inconsistent with the indivisibility of extension. In any case, Spinoza is a materialist, for extension is given the attributes of ultimate reality. If, however, we overlook the inconsistency, Spinoza is an atomist and a fatalist. He must be included within the group of the "New Epicureans". "Nothing is then more fitting for the destruction of the Atheism of Spinoza and of Epicurus than the principles of Descartes concerning the essence of matter." The divisibility of matter overthrows the unity of substance that forms the basis of Spinoza's edifice. The establishment of exten- sion as the essence of matter excludes from matter the principles of movement, and this destroys the atheism of Epicurus. The Cartesian concept of matter enables Descartes to separate the finite and the infinite, or at least the indefinite and the in- finite. The distinction between the finite and infinite substances, in Gerdil's Cartesianism, is fundamental, precisely as the principle of a single substance is basic for Spinozism. The latter doctrine, were it made consistent and given consistency of expression, would define matter-substance as the supreme reality. What Spinozism describes as the "attribute" of thought is, if the term be allowed at all, an attribute of matter. Thought is a manifestation of matter, a mode of extension. Gerdil's interpretation of Spinoza presents the system as an epiphenomenalism. The Cartesian concept of mat- ter, distinguishing the indefinite and the infinite, the moved from the creative principle of motion and continuance in existence, also excluded thought and spirit from matter. The Cartesian principles, then, according to Gerdil, provide a new and ample basis for the defense of religion and theology against the threat of materialism, atheism, and atomism. The destroyer of Scholasticism becomes the defender of the faith.

It will be conceded that the Car- tesian refutations of Spinoza cannot be regarded as accurate re- flections of his doctrine. They indicate, on the whole, what their authors understood as Spinozism. Perhaps such a statement needs some qualification. We may suspect, here and there, a deliberate misrepresentation of Spinoza's teaching in order to facilitate its refutation. Even admitting this qualification, however, the refuta- tions must express, even in the deliberate distortions of Spinozistic doctrine, the position of that doctrine in the intellectual situation. Thus the critics of Spinoza, however little they tell us of Spinoza, tell us a great deal concerning themselves-and of the grounds of their allegiance to Descartes. What the critic of Spinoza regarded as a successful refutation will express both the critic's conception of Spinoza is ruined; for Spinoza, if it mean anything, asserts refutations imply the identification of the philosophy with atheism. This, in itself, however, is unimportant. The more significant fact is the critics' recognition that this atheism is a new atheism. With this goes the conviction that new grounds are necessary for the refutation of an atheism that is new. The effort of Lamy, which is the effort of a Benedictine, deliberately seeks to accomplish its purpose by bending to this purpose philosophical ideas borrowed from recent philosophers. There can be, of course, nothing surprising in Lamy's assertion that, if Spinoza is not an atheist, he at least does not rise above the level of Deism. But after all, Spinoza is an atheist, for the Spinozistic God is a universal being indistinguishable from the to- l'Homme. Par un Religieux Benedictin de la Congregation de Saint Maur. A Paris, Chez Jean de Nully, MDCXCVI. Lamy explains in the Avertissement that the refutation according to the geometrical order was written before the publication of his Traite de la Connoissance de Soi-Meme, and his Verite kvidente de la Religion Creftienne. Having been requested to write a refutation according to the "common" (or usual) method, he issues this volume containing both forms of refutation. The volume appeared under impressive auspices: it contains "approbations" by Monseigneur de Fenelon, Archeveque, Duc de Cambray, by Monseigneur de Sillert, Eve'que de Sois- sons; by Hideux, Cure de Saints Innocens; and by M. Coulaw, Directeur de la Biblioteque Mazarine. It begins with a statement of the "Idee du Sisteme de Spinosa &amp; de la refutation qu'on en fait". There follows the First Treatise, containing a refutation according to "la methode commune"; the Second Treatise, a refutation concerned with the possibility of the Incarnation; and then the Third Treatise, a "Refutation suivant la methode des Geometres". The work concludes with a "Parallel" drawn between the religion and morality of Spinoza with the Christian, "&amp; meme avec la lumiere naturelle".</page><page sequence="14">474 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. tality of nature, a being without liberty, non-providential, "sans but et sans fin, sans choix &amp; sans election". That the consequences of Spinozism are "funestes,"-that the young are being seduced by the doctrine, its adherents increasing, "les Libertins" finding support in it-all of this is to be expected. Our interest in Lamy's efforts must turn upon more specific considerations. The Spinozis- tic philosophy, for our Benedictine, is characteristic of the new age; it supplies a capital expression of everything that could be found wrong with the world. For Lamy thinks that Spinoza is no isolated phenomenon. This philosophy is a response to the intel- lectual needs of minds and temperaments in revolt. Let us, there- fore, first inquire of our author: how and why did the Spinozistic philosophy arise? We may then inquire what Lamy takes this philosophy to be-the "Idlee generate du sisteme de Spinoza, &amp; de ses principales consequences" as the title of Section II runs. From this point we are prepared to appreciate the general plan of Lamy's refutation. Spinoza's doctrine effects a "bouleversement" not merely in re- ligion and morality, but even in our conceptions of nature. This change, however, is the consequence of an effort to give a system- atic foundation for the modern ethical revolt. What Lamy finds in Spinozism may be described in one word: Naturalism. The metaphysics of Spinoza is the ground for ethical naturalism: but ethical naturalism is precisely what demanded the metaphysics. The modern age, at heart, demands the overthrow of Christian morality. The essential trait of Christian morality is its uncom- promising opposition to natural impulse. It remains, for Lamy, an ethics of renunciation. The modern revolt seeks a rational justifica- tion for its aversion to Christian morality and for its ethical and political naturalism. To accomplish this, according to Lamy, phi- losophy must furnish a metaphysical ground for an anti-Christian morality and politics. But it must do more-for it must provide an explanation of the fact that there is a Christian morality. Chris- tian morality must be explained-by explaining it away. To explain it away, as Lamy regards the effort, there arises a conceptual scheme which the Eighteenth Century employed again and again in many variants. This is accomplished by the doctrine which at- tributes the rules and laws of Christian morality to a political and</page><page sequence="15">No. 5.] CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 475 social plot. Those who possessed power exploited the superstitions and fears of the masses, developing the Christian code, in order to insure the subjection of men to priestly and political authority. This is the thesis of the naturalists. Lamy urges that the thesis is unsupportable so long as ordinary ideas concerning God and man and the world are retained. A set of new ideas is required. The naturalistic revolt, having speciously explained away Christian morality and institutions, must seek reinforcement by a metaphysi- cal foundation. To do this, it must, on the negative side, destroy the traditional ideas of the providential governance of the world, which will mean atheism, necessity, and mechanism in nature. On the positive side, it must define a point of view from which the equivalence of right and good, on the one hand, and the natural on the other, necessarily follows."' In the eyes of Lamy the Spinozistic philosophy, with its specious appearance of compelling logical rigor, is the outstanding effort to provide radicalism with rational justification. On the grounds that we must fight fire with fire, the refutation must oppose metaphysics to metaphysics, reason to reason. It is important to note that Lamy recognizes the problem to be meta- physical. The horrible consequences-in morality, in political life, in institutional conflicts-are symptomatic. The time has passed when anything can be accomplished by appeal to dogma and to faith. What needs to 'be accomplished can and must be accom- plished by reason-"meme avec la lumiere naturelle". What are the principles of this naturalistic metaphysics that must be overthrown? And where, if we are to depend upon the natural light of reason, are we to find the point d'appui of this refutation? The purpose of the refutation is to reinstate what this metaphysics threatens to destroy. The negation of the ethical and religious consequences depends upon the refutation of the meta- physics devised to support this transvaluation of values so charac- teristic of the modern age. Now Lamy recognizes that the Spinozis- tic teaching is thoroughly consistent in its rejection of all anthropomorphical ideas-in its designation of the conceptions of a rewarding and punishing, a providential deity, and the ethical " P. 84 and ff.</page><page sequence="16">476 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. principles correlated therewith, as anthropomorphic. Moreover, Spinoza's Biblical criticism, which deprives Holy Writ of meta- physical significance, is a necessary consequence of the naturalistic metaphysics. The traditional conceptions of Christian theology, not to say the formulations of its mysteries, so Lamy recognizes, must necessarily be for Spinoza a set of symbolic expressions, possessing only an elliptical value. Social serviceability is the pragmatic test of their worth. Thus original sin must be reduced by Spinoza to the level of fiction. Even good and beauty can have no objective significance.20 Lamy is convinced that the use by a Spinozist of a phrase such as 'The Love of God' is preposterous. The traditional language of theology is utterly unfit for the expression of Spinozis- tic ideas. When Spinoza declares that to admit miracles is to incur the danger of Atheism, Lamy can record only astonishment. It is the paradox of an Atheist who "gives preservatives against Atheism'".2' Lamy's real accusation is that Spinozism, by employ- ing traditional verbiage, surreptiously seeks to make his doctrine appear to be in harmony with belief when, in fact, it is wholly in- consistent with the faith. Spinoza would attribute values to his doctrine that' it cannot possess, since these values follow only if traditional expressions convey the traditional meanings asso- ciated with them, and do not follow when the expressions have only the significance of metaphor, which they must have in the Spinozistic context. The point of this situation is that, for Lamy, Spinozism is a doctrine devised to support anti-anthropomorphism; the meta- physical principles provide a foundation of a mechanistic view of nature; this mechanistic science of nature implies determinism; and accordingly free-will and associated theological and ethical ideas become mere projections of human impulse into objective nature. In return, this conclusion reflects back upon the nature of man, and results in Spinozistic views concerning man equally at variance with tradition. Spinoza's attitude towards the passions as expressed in his political thought would have seemed to Lamy thoroughly consistent. Neither to praise nor to dispraise the pas- sions, but to understand them-this is to take them naturalistically. But taken in this way, human nature appears as an incident in the '2 Cf. p. 48, pp. 53-54. 21 Cf. p. 39, pp. 34-35, 55, 59.</page><page sequence="17">No. 5.] CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 477 system of nature. It furnishes no clues to a reality lying beyond. Moreover, whatever laws of morality this view of man may sug- gest, these laws can have no value lying beyond their expediency in a social system. The larger fish devour the smaller fish by supreme natural right, and so with man conceived as an incident within the system of nature. With organized society civil right comes into being. The validity of this right, however, is circumscribed by the life of society. The function of religion must then be the inculca- tion of piety. And the entire system of religious ideas is essentially a set of symbols for a merely socio-political content. Within the context of Spinozism, as Lamy thinks, the 'love of God' is either an elaborate symbol for social control or it is nothing. 'Sin' may have meaning within a given social system, but not beyond it. When Spinoza employs such expressions as the 'love of God' in his meta- physical context, the phrase becomes evasive. Its employment may be due to deliberate artifice expressing a lack of courage. Either Spinoza seeks to deceive, or else he is pathetically incapable of recognizing the consequences of his own doctrine. Spinozism is a 'new' atheism. It is a naturalism-but a natural- ism that is in some sense equally new. Spinozism reflects a modern context. What it denies with significance for Lamy's defense of religion, morality, and theology, is something also modern. In brief, Lamy's zeal is not that of a Scholastic contending against modernity. On the contrary, he represents dissension within the context of modern reflection. The refutation of the new atheism must be provided by a metaphysics that is equally a product of modernity. Lamy's refutation, then, is a Cartesian refutation. Within these conditions, the crucial point in the refutation of Spinozism, lies within the nature of man. Lamy affirms this again and again. The very title of his book asserts that the refutation is drawn for the greater part, from knowledge of the nature of man. Knowledge of man is "l'ecueil du Spinozisme", the reef upon which the wave of Spinozism is shattered.22 Spinoza may assert the immortality of man; but Spinozistic immortality, whatever it may be, is at least in no sense an immortality which points back- ward to the nature of man as a clue to reality or forward to the objective validity and metaphysical implications of morality. 22 Cf. pp. 25-32, p. 83.</page><page sequence="18">478 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. Within the naturalistic system, Lamy in effect insists, no one thing possesses primacy over another, neither the living over the non- living, nor man over the remainder of the animate world. Man may be the most highly evolved of things-but the adjectival phrase has no value significance. Spinoza, if he is to be overthrown, must be refuted by arguments drawn from the nature of man. With this we again come upon the central fact presented by the refutations of Spinozism. The Spinozistic metaphysics defines the nature of the Spinozistic man. From this definition of the Spinozistic man flow all those conse- quences, in the context of practical life, that Lamy and other op- ponents describe as "funestes". Metaphysics, however, can be re- futed by metaphysics alone. The Spinozistic metaphysical man, so to speak, can be replaced successfully only by means of an op- ponent metaphysical man. The opponent conception of man, however, cannot be drawn from Scholasticism-this would not be fighting fire with fire. The opposition of ideas, to be effective continuously, must itself be defined by a common context. The refutation of Spinoza must begin with a modern metaphysics that takes its departure from the nature of man. Lamy must ask: where is there such a metaphysics? To his mind, there is but one answer. The Cartesian philosophy meets the requirements. The Cartesian philosophy supplies, not merely an idea of the nature of man, but a true idea of his nature. In the context of Cartesianism we come to knowledge of man. This philosophy, indeed, is founded upon truths concerning the nature of man. Thus, according to Lamy, the ref uta- tion of Spinoza depends upon a Cartesian standpoint. More pre- cisely, it depends upon the Cartesian ontological dualism. Descartes becomes the defender of the faith, and can fulfill this destiny because he affirms what Spinozism would deny-the real distinc- tion between soul and body. As with Gerdil, so for Lamy, the first step is a demonstration of the contrast between the philosophies of Descartes and Spinoza. Lamy centers his effort on a disproof of the position that Cartesian- ism generated the later system. The exploitation of Cartesian ideas as the basis for refutation is implicit in the Second Treatise, the "Refutation de l'erreur de Spinosa, sur la possibility de l'Incarna- tion". It is also implicit in the document called the "Parallele de la</page><page sequence="19">No. 5.] CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 479 Religion &amp; de la Morale de Spinosa, avec la Religion &amp; Morale de Jesus-Christ, &amp; meme avec la lumiere naturelle". But in a second parallel the comparison of the two philosophies is made explicit. The first stage of the disproof of Cartesian responsibility for Spinoza is formed by a reference to the distinction of substances. ". . . Toute sa philosophic ne roule que sur la distinction reelle qu'il met entre la substance letendue &amp; la substance pensante; &amp; qu'ainsi il admit dans la nature plurality des substances." Lamy adds that: "nous venons de voir au contraire que la philosophic de Spinosa ne roule que sur la confusion qu'il fait de ces deux substances, &amp; sur la supposition extravagante d'une seule substance dans la nature; le corps &amp; l'esprit dit-il, ne sont que la meme chose".23 In this fashion, Lamy interprets the Spinozistic dictum concerning one and the same thing, viewed under different attributes. In a summary of Cartesian doctrine, he enumerates six principles, peculiar to the former, and denied severally and collectively by Spinozism. The central point is the Cartesian principle that the soul is not a mode of being (une maniere d'etre), either of God or of body, or of any other thing whatever. Thus the Cartesian isolation of the soul from nature, and its definition as substance, undergoes a remarkable increase in importance. The mind-body dualism was advanced by Cartesians as an irresistible truth.24 Descartes alone has revealed to philosophy both what the soul is and what is the nature of matter. In the earlier stages of debate between Cartesians and anti-Cartesians, the alleged irresistible truth encountered derision. Confronting a new enemy, however, the Cartesian offensive against atheism must be launched from the body-mind dualism. The Cartesians themselves had acknowl- edged-with reluctance here and there-the absorption of the ani- mals within the single realm of matter substance and mechanical law. Spinozism, as the opponents of Spinoza viewed his doctrine, would complete the engulfing of life within matter. The refutation of Spinozism, then, must begin with the position that in its con- ception of man Cartesianism stands in irreconcilable opposition to the doctrine of Spinoza. The very meaning of the term 'meta- 2 P. 486. 24 Cf. "Louis de la Forge and the Critique of Substantial Forms," Phil. Review XLI (November, I932).</page><page sequence="20">480 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. physics' reflects this adoption of Cartesianism: Lamy declares that metaphysics is above all the science "qui nous fait connoitre la difference qu'il y a entre les esprits &amp; les corps, qui nous decouvre ce qui se peut connoitre de la nature de l'ame, &amp; de son immortality; de la nature de Dieu, de son Existence, de sa Providence, de sa Puissance, etc. etc".25 The refutation of Spinoza, as the title of Lamy's First Treatise assures us, is accompanied by pure reason, which finds in knowledge of the nature of man "l'ecueil" of Spinozism and the source of the duties of Christian morality. The first chapter, moreover, is devoted to the "verities, &amp; duties which spring from the distinction of spirit and body", to "the jjustesse of their union", and "to the capacity by which the spirit knows and loves". In the context of controversy before us, Cartesian meta- physics is definitive in principle. Lamy stands squarely upon his dualistic basis of Cartesian origin. Effects, actions, express the nature of things. With man we find two wholly opposed series of actions. Therefore there must be two principles as the sources of the dissimilar consequences. If, now, these principles are substances, and man is a composite of substances, Spinozism is in principle refuted.26 There are two sub- stances for the reason that either can be conceived wholly inde- pendently of the idea of the other. With this the "whole edifice" of Spinoza is ruined, for Spinozism, if it mean anything, asserts the existence of but one substance, and this implies the reduction of all phenomena to a common denominator. The dissimilarities revealed in man's composite nature are irre- ducible. Lamy even derives from this irreducibility an argument for the existence of God. Only an infinitely wise and powerful being could be the author of man, for such an order of power and wisdom is necessary to effect the union, in one being, of substances so opposed.27 Thus the Cartesian dualism, affording a first argu- ment for the existence of God, provides the foundation upon which may be reinstated the arguments from design. The latter had evi- dently become an object of derision. For Lamy asserts that, de- spite the ridicule of his readers, one may establish a supreme wis- dom ruling the world from the functions of the human body.28 2" pp. 5-6. 2' pp. 98, 99. 27 Pp. I03-105. ' PP. 93-96.</page><page sequence="21">No. 5.] CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 48I With due attention to his dual nature, then, man need not pass beyond that nature in order to establish the existence of God, i.e., of God in the sense in which Spinoza would reject the conception as anthropomorphic. Je pense, donc je suis, is no more evident that Je suis, donc il y a un Dieu infiniment sage.29 It is quite un- necessary to burden the reader with the details of Lamy's argu- ments. It is sufficient to note that man's nature provides the source of two sets of arguments: the one, the arguments from design drawn from man's body; the other, the arguments from the native ethical endowment of the soul. From the very duality of man's na- ture an infinitely wise and powerful author is demonstrated. Upon this foundation the body serves to reinstate the arguments from design, and the soul to give an objective reality to those ethical ideas that, for Spinozistic naturalism (according to Lamy) cannot be more than projections of social experience. Moreover, the superiority of the soul to the body is obvious from the fact that the soul is capable of thought while the body is not. From this it follows that human experience must reveal two sets of values, the one superior to the other. The soul's immortality, which follows from its indivisibility and immateriality of substance, ex- tends the values of the soul from the finite to the infinite sphere.30 With this, the whole of Christian morality, against which the naturalists and free-thinkers are secretly in revolt, is of course, reinstated. The spirit of this morality, as Lamy has made clear, is renunciatory; thus the Cartesian dualism has served to provide a metaphysical basis for an other-worldly morality. The deprecia- tion of sense as a source of knowledge, according to the Cartesian doctrine, becomes in Lamy's hands an auxiliary of this morality. Reflection upon the nature of man, upon the conditions of the union of soul and body, reinforces the anti-naturalistic point of view. Man is not naturally without duties and without law.3' The doctrine of innate ideas is thus transformed into a doctrine of an original ethical endowment. Correspondingly, the doctrine that the senses are the source of unclear and indistinct ideas takes an ethi- cal turn. The union of soul and body subjects the former to the impact of ideas from sense aroused within the soul upon the 29 P. io6. ' First Treatise, ch. iii, pp. 171 ff. 8 P. i43 and ff.</page><page sequence="22">482 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. occasion of the perceptual process. The sense-ideas, however, have very bad effects upon the soul, turning it towards earthly things. In this way the corruption of human nature may be explained; the soul is thus "disadvantageously" situated with respect to the per- formance of its chief duties. Just as the obscurity of the sense-idea, as a knowledge function, cannot be dispelled but is incurable, in the same manner sense-experience cannot be expurgated. As Lamy states the matter, our indispensable duties are to flee from sense- objects and sense-experience. The soul and the body define two utterly dissimilar sets of values: the first, born of the soul, ex- presses the immortality of its nature; the second, the interests of the body and this life, for the sake of which Spinoza wrote a metaphysics. Cartesianism, not Scholasticism, it seems, is an other- worldly philosophy! The Refutation of Spinoza, so far, has proceeded according to the "Methode commune"-it is a treatise for the generality. The Refutation in the Third Treatise proceeds according to the geo- metrical method, and is the esoteric doctrine. The third treatise is aimed solely at the first book of the Ethics, for with the over- throw of this the whole structure of Spinozism is destroyed. Lamy proposed to conduct his enterprise by accepting, in the main, Spi- noza s axioms and definitions. The definitions of substance, mode, and attribute, are adopted, but not that of God. Lamy's own ax- ioms begin with this, that la reality, la verite, la bonte' ou la per- fection &amp; Unite are properties inseparable from Being. These are called transcendent because they are necessarily found in every- thing that is truly Being. Significantly, Lamy's second axiom as- serts that thought is nobler than extension.32 He seeks to estab- lish that the idea of substance necessarily includes the idea of Being. The very idea of attribute involves the notion of substance, and therefore cannot be conceived by itself. This purpose, of course, is to maintain that, from attributes which can be con- ceived independently of other attributes, we must infer the exist- ence of diverse substances. Thus against Spinoza his refuta- tion must maintain the existence of several, and not of one sub- stance; or, what for him amounts to the same thing, he must urge that independence of attribute implies substances as diverse as the ' Pp. 26-263.</page><page sequence="23">No. 5.1 CARTESIAN REFUTATIONS OF SPINOZA 483 attributes. With this he establishes the Cartesian dualism of sub- stances as the central principle upon which the geometrical refuta- tion of Spinozism must be based.33 At the same time he denies that thought and extension are equally attributes of God. For the essen- tial attribute of God is thought, while extension constitutes a being distinguished from God, and excluded from the essence of God.3' So much accomplished, there follow for Lamy the propositions which restore the world of extension as a creation of God, freedom rather than necessity for God, and the existence of thinking sub- stance, man, really distinguished from God and outside of his essence. Cousin, examining two obscure documents concerning the relation of Cartesianism and Spinozism, reaches this conclu- sion. Mais on peut dire aujourd'hui toute la veriti: ce n'est pas tel ou tel principe cartesien, c'est l'esprit meme du dix-septieme siecle, qui, apres avoir produit le cartesianisme, c'est-a-dire un spiritualisme aussi judi- cieux que sublime, l'entrainait en meme temps vers la double erreur du spinozisme et du jansenisme. Le dix-septieme siecle est en effet comme imbu de l'idee de la toute-puissance divine et du neant des creatures. II incline 'a ne reconnaitre qu'un seul acteur veritable sur la scene de ce monde, une seule cause, un seul etre, Dieu. La' est l'unite de la philosophic de ce grand siecle, comme l'uniti de la philosophic du siecle suivant est dans l'affaiblissement de l'idee de Dieu, et dans un sentiment outre des forces de l'homme qui aboutit a une sorte d'apo- theose de l'humanite.95 If Cousin's characterization of the inner tendency of the Seven- teenth Century be accepted, the importance of the Cartesian dual- ism in the Refutation of Spinoza may be reaffirmed. Descartes' own distinction between infinite and finite substance was shaky. Deny its validity, and it could be argued that Spinozism is gen- erated-or three Spinozisms, according to the manner in which the results are interpreted. Spinozism as a spiritualism; as a material- ism; or as a doctrine in which thought and extension, defined as attributes, would be merely attributes of substance. In any case, as Gerdil and Lamy would view such a result, it might imply the nothingness of the creature. A conclusion of this order, for the Cardinal and the Benedictine priest, could scarcely be tolerable. 9Pp. 299-306. 34Pp. 3I9, 329. "Op. cit. I 295.</page><page sequence="24">484 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW The Cartesian dualism of finite substances-that is, a concept of substance permitting a distinction between infinite and finite substance-was of critical significance for the controversial inter- est of Lamy and Gerdil. If the Spinozistic single-substance doc- trine could be construed as a materialism, refutation might be facilitated. In the final analysis, however, it was of greater im- portance to maintain a real distinction between God and creature. The Cartesian dualism alone, as Gerdil and Lamy implicitly feel, will provide for the reality of man, the reality of nature, while preventing both the absorption of man in physical nature and in God, and finally preventing the identification of God with nature's substance. If Scholasticism be regarded as overthrown, then on the Cartesian basis alone, Lamy evidently believes, can atheism be avoided and the revolt against Christian morality be defeated. ALBERT G. A.
