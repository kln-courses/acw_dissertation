Marriott I THE designs. had NORTH an These instinctive AMERICAN paintings interest were in INDIANS, executed making on pictures like many all primitive types and painting of man, sur- had an instinctive interest in making pictures and painting designs. These paintings were executed on many types of sur- faces - on pottery, baskets, tipis, buffalo robes, shields, garments and on rocks. Most of these paintings disappeared with the fragile materials on which they were painted, but the paintings on protected rock walls and overhanging cliffs remain today as the great art galleries of prehistoric American Indian painting. Although these rock pictures are common in North America, and are particularly abundant in South and West Texas, they have been accorded relatively little public or scientific attention and are rarely cited as important examples of aboriginal art. Similar paint- ings on the walls of caves in France, Spain and Africa have been thoroughly studied and have achieved a certain public fame, even in America. This public indifference and a realization that many of the best examples are being destroyed by man and the weather, prompted Forrest Kirkland and his wife, both professional artists of Dallas, to undertake the study and accurate recording of Indian rock paint- ings in Texas. In 1933, the Kirklands saw rock pictures for the first time on a cliff along the Concho River near Paint Rock, Texas. The artists returned in 1934 to make scaled copies in accurate color of every design and picture at this location. During the following seven sum- 137</page><page sequence="2">138 INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS mers - in nineteen weeks of actual working time - the Kirklands expended their "vacations" working at sites extending from the Nueces River valley to the Davis Mountain region and north to the Canadian River in the Panhandle. The rock pictures made by the Indians are of two kinds : those scratched, pecked or carved on the rock surfaces (petroglyphs), and those painted in colors (pictographs). Since the painted pictures were liable to be destroyed much sooner than the petroglyphs, the Kirklands devoted the major part of their working time to recording pictographs. At each site every legible painting was copied to an exact scale and in color. At the time of his death in 1942, Mr. Kirk- land had executed almost two hundred facsimile paintings in water colors - all the pictographs at more than half the known locations in Texas. As a trained artist, accustomed to working in a meticulously detailed style, Mr. Kirkland was especially well equipped for the work of recording the Indian pictographs as examples of Indian art. Aware of his lack of formal scientific training, the artist studied geology, archaeology and ethnology so that he might better under- stand the cultural associations of the paintings he was preserving and transcribe them into a form more accessible to the sciences. Few complete recordings of prehistoric rock pictures have been attempted on a large scale. Some of the most important collections of such work are in the Prehistoric Rock Picture Gallery, the Africa Archives and the Excerptur in Frankfort-on-Main, Germany. Assembled under the direction of Professor Leo Frobenius beginning in 1904, these collections are administered by the Research Institute for the Morphology of Civilization which Professor Frobenius founded in 1923. In 1937 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City exhibited copies of some of the Frobenius European and African rock pictures. In 1941 the same museum exhibited a section of the great Indian mural in Barrier Canyon, Utah, as a part of a general exhibition of Indian art. Before either of these exhibitions in the United States, Forrest Kirkland had evolved his own system for studying and copying Indian pictographs and had presented them in limited exhibitions. Some of his copies of pictographs were shown</page><page sequence="3">INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS 139 along with works from the Frobenius collections at the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Massachusetts, in 1938. Once interested in the project, the Kirklands worked furiously against time. They were determined to preserve an art form and a rare historical record before it was too late. Yet never did the in- tensity of their interest impair the quality of the work accomplished. In general, the Kirkland procedure of recovering Indian pictographs was that of the archaeologist combined with the understanding of the creative artist. After a general survey of regions in Texas in which pictographs were reported, Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland made field trips to chosen sites, often in remote parts of the state and almost always over difficult terrain. When the sites were reached, the location was care- fully mapped and the work carried out systematically. Mrs. Kirkland kept a complete photographic record of the work to supplement her husband's paintings and scouted succeeding locations where paintings were to be studied and copied. Mr. Kirkland first determined the number and type of designs to be copied ; then measured walls and selected the scale of the water color paintings. If the wall paintings were too large to be recorded on one plate, and often the pictographs were more than a hundred feet in length, the artist divided them into sections with upright sticks rather than by chalking the wall. Each section was then carefully measured and copied to scale on a single plate. At times the artist was forced to stand waist-deep in streams running at the bottoms of cliffs in order to work. At other shelters he could execute his paintings only by lying flat on his back to copy paintings on rock ceilings. Often the paintings were so dimmed by weathering or smoke they needed constant wetting to restore them to visibility. After experimentation, Mr. Kirkland decided to record the picto- graphs in water color painting rather than by using the more obvious and commonly used methods of tracing or photography. The inaccessible location and large dimension of some of the pictures made the tracing method impractical. Photography was mechanically suitable but unsatisfactory as a scientific medium because many</page><page sequence="4">140 INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS designs were so dim they would not photograph ; shadows and rock forms often destroyed the form of the designs on the negative ; on curving or angular walls the camera could not be focussed without distortion of the painting; and, most important, not even the color camera could restore original colors in the paintings. The artist was able to overcome all of these faults of recording in his water color paintings, made with painstaking care and with the hand and eye guided by an understanding spirit. By studying available natural pigments, a broad knowledge of color used in the original paintings was arrived at, and the artist was able to record, and, where necessary, logically re-create the colors of the designs with subtlety and richness. The colors used ranged from purple-red through bright red, black, orange, yellow and white. Red, in various shades, was the most used and most durable color. During the winter months, when time could be spared from his professional work and when field work was impossible, Mr. Kirk- land transcribed his field notes into factual material supplementing each water color, and wrote his observations and conclusions. On the back of each water color plate, to prevent data from being sepa- rated from its illustration, facts about site and painting and field observations were attached. To the scientific archaeologist the backs of the Kirkland plates are as interesting as the paintings themselves. An excellent demonstration of the study and understanding with which this artist enforced the spirit of the work he accomplished are the six illustrated articles prepared for and published in the annual bulletins of the Texas Archaeological and Paleontological Society from 1937 through 1942, and similar articles in other journals including the Central Texas Archeologist. Each article was as direct, impersonal and carefully accurate as the water color paintings them- selves. Supplementing the presentation of the paintings and articles Mr. Kirkland lectured often to impress on the people of Texas the importance of these indigenous paintings. As collaborator in the work already accomplished, Mrs. Kirkland is determined to carry out the unfinished work on the Texas pictographs. At the time of his death the artist had completed an elaborate prospectus for an illustrated volume on his study of Indian rock paintings. This book,</page><page sequence="5">INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS 141 carried into published form, should be one of the important works on the art of the American Indian. Exhibitions of some of the Kirkland paintings have been pre- sented at several locations in Texas, including a large showing at the Hall of State, Dallas, in 1938 ; at the Addison Gallery of Amer- ican Art, Andover, Massachusetts (1938), already mentioned; and at the Buffalo Museum of Science, Buffalo, New York (1940). A comprehensive exhibition of the pictographs will be presented in March, 1943, at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. II In spite of much work by amateurs and professionals the scope of Texas pre-history has not yet been defined and interpreted. The complexity of such a vast territory, which has not even today pro- duced a unified type of white life, encouraged a diversity of Indian cultures about which much more must be learned. It is evident that the Kirkland records of Indian pictographs and petroglyphs, as well as other works in this field, offer excellent opportunities for aiding in the further study of Texas archaeology. In articles for scientific journals, Mr. Kirkland prepared com- parisons between Texas rock pictures and those of Paleolithic (Mag- dalenian culture) paintings in Europe, and outlined many of the possibilities for continued regional archaeological study as revealed in the Texas paintings. These fields for investigation include con- sideration of the pictographs as Indian "writings," as historical and mnemonic records indicating the age and activities of vanished peo- ples, as sympathetic magic or ceremonial documents, and as examples of Indian art. The most immediate and popular reaction to Indian pictographs prompts the question, "Can they be interpreted - what do they mean?" Some "old timers" have claimed they used these pictures to guide them to buried treasure (never found!). Many articles and books have made their contribution toward interpretation of picto- graphs, but it must be admitted that no key or Rosetta Stone has yet been evolved to permit literal translation of such pictures if considered as writing.</page><page sequence="6">142 INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS The age of pictographs cannot be definitely stated but it has been approximated by Mr. Kirkland through comparative means. Many pictures show horses, guns and churches, and must obviously belong in historic time after the white man's coming. Absence of such pictorial identifications, dim color on a firm rock surface and ac- cumulation of deep midden deposits against and often partially covering the painted walls provide ample evidence that some paint- ings are prehistoric, perhaps even the "thousand years" of popular conception. At many locations some designs overlap others. Such overlapping and overpainting, interpreted by the artist through knowledge of colors used, indicates the presence of different cultures in sequence. Often, recognizable figures and designs compel comparison of age with other cultures : the Basket Maker muralists of Barrier Canyon, Utah, already mentioned; the Hopi and other pueblo peoples; the Mimbres of Arizona; the Kiowa, Comanche and Navajo. With the Kirkland paintings available for research some progress can be made in comparative research. The Texas pictographs as this artist has preserved them offer great possibility for ethnological investigation as sympathetic magic, ceremonial documents, or historical records. The time spent in paint- ing them and the care employed in their execution is proof that these designs had serious purpose. The location of some paintings within the caves, out of reach above the shelter floor and extending onto the ceilings, show that ladders or scaffolding must have been neces- sary for the paintings to be accomplished. All prehistoric man's belief in sympathetic magic is frequently represented in the picto- graphs. In the Davis Mountain region and Val Verde County pic- tures of many animals pierced with spears and arrows were un- doubtedly painted to insure success in hunting. Again, if an Indian was wounded in battle or performed an act of bravery he would paint a record of the event. The act of painting a narrow escape from danger or death might assure the artist of other escapes. Consultation with living Indians adds information about the purpose of pictographs although it does not produce literal mean- ings. To some contemporary Indians the ceremonial or symbolical</page><page sequence="7">Detail of Indian wall painting in Rattlesnake Canyon near Langtry, Texas. The length of the pictograph is seventy-five feet , some of the figures being fifteen feet high. This painting was studied and copied by Forrest Kirkland in 1937. It is one of the oldest prehistoric wall paintings in Texas and an outstanding example of primitive abstract art.</page><page sequence="8">INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS 143 meaning of such pictures is the most important. Perhaps a dream or vision of supernatural power is represented by the anthropomorphic figures in a painting, and the dreamer was required to execute a painting to receive the power. Each act of painting, performed in succession over a period of years, might strengthen and renew the power. Perhaps the painting of supernatural beings invoked these beings and brought good harvest and hunting to the painter and his people. This ceremonial purpose of some pictographs is clearly depicted in the Rattlesnake Canyon murals near the town of Langtry (see a detail of this painting in illustration) and in the Panther Cave designs at the mouth of Seminole Canyon. As a result of Mr. Kirk- land's research in other shelters containing overlapping pictures, he judged these pictographs to be the oldest in Texas. Despite their faded condition they are impressive in scale and spirit. Each mural is about eighty feet in length and fifteen feet in height. In the treat- ment of these majestic and unearthly figures standing with upraised arms, the devotion of the Indian artist is plainly revealed. Forrest Kirkland believed that these were pictures with ceremonial meaning, painted out of a deep-seated tradition of the influence of mytho- logical beings and images on man. At Meyers Springs, near Dreyden, Texas, are pictographs which represent some of the most recently executed paintings superimposed on dim images of very early pictographs. The recent paintings illus- trate historical events and are not concerned with spiritual influences on human life but with human life itself. Here are people going about their daily life - hunting, praying, fighting and dancing. The recognizable drawings of stage coaches ; Spaniards in high top boots ; church towers with crosses, and other images date these works in historic time. Lacking the majestic spirit of the Rattlesnake Canyon and Panther Cave pictographs, the intricate, small scale designs in the Meyers Springs pictures achieve interest through illustrative content. If the Kirkland copies of Indian pictographs offer unusual oppor- tunity for investigation by archaeologists and ethnologists they pro- vide an equally stimulating exhibition of Indian art. At a period in</page><page sequence="9">144 INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS art when an increasing interest is being shown in re-valuation of all "primitive" art, the arts of the North American Indians are coming to be highly regarded. Primitive art is important to the modern artist and such indigenous paintings as the Indian pictographs of Texas, so little known, should provide remarkable sources of in- spiration. Any evaluation of Indian pictographs as art must recognize the limitless intentions and aspects of art expressions. Accurate and life-like representation has been the purpose of art during some periods, but it must be remembered that other art qualities, such as symbolism or "emotional expressionism/' have been more important to many other ages and peoples. The intent of many of the oldest Indian pictographs in Texas was not to illustrate but to represent. Colored and arranged into great murals, these figures possess a sense of abstract balance and rhythm completely unlike the sophisticated compositions of life-like figures with which we are familiar. In fact, as the Indian picto- graphs evolved from symbolic pictures into illustrations of recog- nizable men, weapons and animals, their importance to Indian culture as a socially useful art activity diminished and disappeared. The conventionalizations of figures and designs in the Val Verde (County) Dry Shelter Cultures (of which the Rattlesnake Canyon and Panther Cave pictures are fine examples) represent art qualities comparable to many great eras in art before the Renaissance. These paintings even suggest comparison with the work of some of the most modern abstract artists of today including Klee, Miro, Picasso, Kandinsky and many others, and prompt a reminder to those mod- ernists that the pictographs were the logical results of long centuries of development. In the color harmonies and pictorial arrangements of the best and oldest pictographs this same result of long evolution is observed. The elaborate, complex, yet beautifully composed ex- amples of Indian pictographs display the qualities of legitimate and important artistic expression. Indian culture has maintained a vitality of great interest to the modern sciences and arts of the United States, and Indian rock pictures are a part of the wealth of this material. By searching out</page><page sequence="10">INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS IN TEXAS 145 and sincerely recording the Indian pictographs in Texas, and by- amassing evidence of comparative ages and cultures through inten- sive study and comparison in the actual field, Forrest Kirkland has made a remarkable contribution to the work of understanding the Indian cultures of North America. By preserving so many picto- graphs in accessible form, as they must have appeared to the eyes of the men who painted them, an obvious and substantial contribution to archaeological knowledge has been made. By making such remark- ably accurate and impersonal facsimiles the artist produced an excit- ing exhibition of outstanding examples of the art of the Texas Indians.</page></plain_text>
