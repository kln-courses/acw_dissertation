<plain_text><page sequence="1">11 JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE DAVID LUBAN We number self-restraint among the human virtues. It is a plati tude of our political culture that judicial self-restraint should likewise be numbered among the judicial virtues, alongside incor ruptibility, disinterest, fairness, and wisdom. Should we accept this platitude? That question animates this chapter. This formulation, however, puts the question badly. "Judicial self-restraint" in its most cogent usage designates not a personal virtue of judges but a structural relation between the judiciary and other branches of government.1 What I shall call the classical conception of judicial self-restraint understands it as a policy regard ing judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation, a policy according to which courts, and especially the United States Su preme Court, should adopt a cautious or "deferential" attitude toward voiding legislation on constitutional grounds. Roughly put, this means upholding legislation even when the judge entertains doubts about its constitutionality, and thus de ferring to the legislature's implicit judgment that the legislation is constitutional. This, in turn, has generally been taken to imply I gratefully acknowledge support for this research from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the Marton and Sophia Macht Founda tion, and comments on an early draft by Richard Posner. 235</page><page sequence="2">236 David Luban that the Court should uphold legislation unless it clearly bears no reasonable relation to a legitimate state purpose. The classical conception was developed and elaborated by what might be called the main line of judicial self-restraint theo rists: Harvard professor James Bradley Thayer, who proposed it in a celebrated 1893 article;2 Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, and Felix Frankfurter; and Yale professor Alex ander Bickel.3 Holmes and Brandeis—personal friends before either was on the Court—were acquaintances of Thayer; Thayer had been Holmes's first legal employer and one of Brandeis's most esteemed professors. Frankfurter was a close friend of both justices, and Bickel was Frankfurter's law clerk. We are speaking, therefore, of something like an apostolic succession, or, in Old Testament imagery, a bloodline of patriarchs. The classical con ception of judicial self-restraint emerged, therefore, from a kind of intellectual gemeinschaft almost unparalleled in the history of juridical ideas. Hence, we are not dealing with a broad consen sus, but rather with a doctrine emerging from a surprisingly narrow base. The classical conception—"Thayerism," we might also call it—holds that the Court should uphold legislation unless the justices deem it not merely unconstitutional but clearly unconsti tutional. Thayerism, that is, amounts to what Bickel would later term the "rule of the clear mistake." It is important to add that the later exponents of judicial self-restraint grafted on addi tional elements, but these should be regarded as friendly amend ments to the classical conception. For the moment, I characterize judicial self-restraint in classical terms alone simply to highlight the error of regarding it as a personal virtue of judges. A judge can defer to a legislature without exhibition or possessing a defer ential character. Deference and judicial self-restraint on the clas sical conception are interpretive strategies, not traits of judicial character. Nevertheless, even if asking whether judicial self-restraint is a judicial virtue commits a category mistake, the important ques tion remains of what traits of character judges must possess to practice self-restraint. This is hardly an eccentric question. In deed, it centrally occupied the theorists and judges who devel oped the classical conception. Is the virtue the "combination of a</page><page sequence="3">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 237 lawyer's rigor with a statesman's breadth of view" that Thayer extols in a pregnant and little-understood passage?4 Is it pru dence, Bickel's term for the political judgment by which the Court discerns that the country is unready to face a constitu tional issue and hence in need of judicial temporizing?5 Is it Holmes's skepticism, or Brandeis's sympathetic immersion in fac tual details, or the "judicial humility" of which Frankfurter speaks?6 These are important and fascinating questions. Whatever character traits make classical self-restraint possible count as judicial virtues only if judicial self-restraint is itself a worthwhile aim. The chief temptation to abandon judicial self restraint arises from a judge's conviction that the legislature has done something bad for the nation and its constitution. The temptation is to play the white knight and save us from the wrongheadedness of our representatives. According to the classi cal conception, the judge must abstain from any such heroics; the judicial role outweighs what we may concede is an imperative of the patriot's conscience. Self-restraint counts as a virtue only if fidelity to a tightly constrained judicial role is a virtue more important than adher ence to the demands of conscience. Defenders of the classical conception argue that judicial deference to the judgment of ma jorities in close constitutional cases is essential to the operation of American constitutional democracy. Thus, in addition to an ac count of judicial virtue, defending the classical conception re quires us to justify deference to legislative majorities even when their actions are clearly wrongheaded. What moral claim do fool ish majorities exert? I believe that each of the principal architects of the classical conception had answers to these questions; but their answers were by no means the same. In this chapter I discuss the answer offered by Justice Holmes. The Puzzle of Self-Restraint The most frequently heard argument on behalf of judicial self restraint takes off from what Bickel calls the "countermajoritarian difficulty": the anomaly, in a democratic system, of unelected judges nullifying acts of the people's elected representatives. No</page><page sequence="4">238 David Luban doubt judicial review is necessary to safeguard minority rights from the "tyranny of the majority." But beyond the clear protec tion of minorities judges must never second-guess the legislature, on pain of undercutting democracy. This argument appears plausible on the surface, but on closer inspection it begins to unravel. To begin with, the fact that fed eral judges are unelected must be regarded as a red herring; the problem of judicial review would remain even if federal judges stood for periodic election. After all, supreme court justices are elected in several states, and it is hard to believe that these states experience no countermajoritarian difficulty. Indeed, if federal judges were elected, voters would confront the question of whether they ought, as good citizens, to hold judges' disagree able constitutional decisions against them at the polls. Perhaps, after all, we have a civic duty to cast our votes for judges on different criteria than whether the judges work our will; perhaps we should favor judges who are willing to nullify acts of our passing fancy on constitutional grounds. We see, of course, that this question simply raises the coun termajoritarian difficulty all over again. Indeed, the same prob lem arises whenever a legislator decides to vote against legislation that a majority of her constituents supports because she believes it to be unconstitutional: this too is the countermajoritarian diffi culty in action. The countermajoritarian difficulty has nothing essentially to do with the "anomaly" of a nonmajoritarian judi ciary, and indeed nothing essentially to do with the judiciary at all. The difficulty inheres in the very nature of constitutionalism it self.7 For constitutions by their very existence constrain the de sires of majorities, and pure majoritarianism makes constitutions impossible.8 Indeed, nothing prevents us from turning Bickel's rhetoric on its head and observing that majority rule creates a "countercon stitutional difficulty." We might reinterpret the American consti tution by noticing how few of its institutions were designed to be purely majoritarian. The president and vice-president are chosen by the electoral college, and until the seventeenth amendment was enacted in 1913 the Senate was nonmajoritarian. Neither the Cabinet nor executive agencies are majoritarian; and the major victory won by the federalists over the antifederalists, dividing</page><page sequence="5">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 239 America into federated units of wide rather than narrow geo graphical scope to weaken local control, ensured that American representative democracy is removed as far as possible from di rect democracy. Judicial review amounts to a buffering of major ity rule, and fits in effortlessly with the many other buffering devices found in the Constitution's structure. Perhaps unbuf fered majority rule, not judicial review, ought to be regarded as the anomalous institution, generating a counterconstitutional difficulty. Obviously, this is a rather farfetched constitutional interpreta tion; I raise it merely to emphasize an objection to Bickel's way of stating the case that can be put less rhetorically: that in point of fact the Constitution is compounded of majoritarian and nonma joritarian elements, and provides no hint that any of the institu tions it creates are anomalies. Talk of the "countermajoritarian difficulty" merely begs the question at issue. Nor do separation of powers considerations affect this conclu sion. One often hears that Congress, not the courts, holds the power to legislate, and so courts should not be in the business of second-guessing Congress; critics denounce "government by ju diciary" and "judicial legislation." But though Congress legis lates, the executive issues orders and rulings, and the courts make decrees and interpret the laws. All three branches issue imperatives, and it settles nothing to characterize judicial inter pretations and decrees as "legislation." This is merely an exercise in conclusory labeling. Perhaps the point is rather that in close calls on the constitution ality of legislation separation of powers considerations demand that courts grant the benefit of the doubt to the legislature—the body, in Thayer's words, to which the "primary authority to inter pret is given"9—rather than to themselves. That is part of Thayer's argument, and it seems quite plausible. "The judiciary may well reflect that if they had been regarded by the people as the chief protection against legislative violation of the constitu tion, they would not have been allowed merely . . . incidental and postponed control. They would have been let in ... to a revision of the laws before they began to operate."10 Nevertheless, this argument also begs the question. The fact that the courts were granted a more limited power of review</page><page sequence="6">240 David Luban than they might have been implies nothing whatever about how they should exercise that limited power. Thayer's argument might equally be turned on its head: "the people's" choice to limit the reviewing role of courts to cases and controversies suggests that judges should refrain from second-guessing that choice by imposing further limitations on themselves with no popular mandate. Moreover, once we grant courts the power of judicial review, incidental and postponed though it may be— and no contemporary proponents of judicial self-restraint have gone on record against Marbury v. Madison—then the fact that legislatures legislate implies nothing about who should defer to whom. Legislatures legislate; courts interpret and review. These are equally fundamental powers of government, and as my earlier remarks about the tension between constitutionalism and majoritarianism indicated, both powers are essential to the total process of lawmaking under a constitution. This being the case, it makes no more intrinsic sense to require courts to defer to legislatures in constitutional questions than to require legisla tures to defer to courts. From the point of view of the separa tion of powers legislators are constitutional amateurs, judges constitutional professionals. Now it may be that, as Thayer and others argue, we do well to entrust large tasks to the legislators, amateurs or not, to inculcate in them a sense of constitutional responsibility; but that argument actually pushes against the grain of the separation of powers. Closely connected with Thayer's argument for deference is the commonly heard equation of judicial self-restraint with fidel ity to law: judges are bound by the commands of the legislature and must keep faith with the law by putting aside their own personal scruples. However, no statute has ever commanded that courts adopt the rule of the clear mistake, and if such a statute were adopted it would probably be deemed unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers. Thayer's argument for deference rests only on judicial tradition coupled with indirect and unsound inferences from constitutional history. Since Thayerism pro poses judicial deference even in the absence of legal mandate, the classical conception of judicial self-restraint has nothing to do with the virtue of fidelity to law.</page><page sequence="7">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 241 Since Thayerism requires the justices to defer to legislative judgments of constitutionality that they in fact disbelieve, a strict policy of fidelity to the law actually seems inconsistent with Thayerism. After all, a judge who wishes to keep faith with the constitution will not defer to what she regards as a constitutional error. At this point we may turn from constitutional to more overtly normative considerations, such as Thayer's argument that we should not use the federal courts as a crutch enabling the rest of the country to legislate and agitate in happy oblivion to the Con stitution, relying on the Court to pull our constitutional bacon out of the fire and bear the brunt of popular pique.11 Periodi cally pollsters surveying the public rediscover the unhappy fact that most of our fellow citizens cheerfully advocate grotesque violations of our constitutional liberties.12 If the courts rein them selves in, we would perhaps find ourselves more willing to think constitutionally in our political deliberations. The supposition that legislative buck passing and popular in difference to liberty are greatly affected by marginal changes in federal court policy, and that deference in close constitutional cases is a marginal change, is quite fanciful. More importantly, deference to legislative majorities simply because they are majori ties, whether or not they have seriously considered the subject they have legislated, and whether or not they accurately repre sent the views of their constituents, hardly seems like a policy calculated to instill political responsibility in the majoritarian branches. Finally, proponents of judicial self-restraint may wish to argue that regardless of whether the constitution is majoritarian, and regardless of the effects of judicial self-restraint on the political branches of government, democracy requires deference to ma jority rule. To the extent that our constitution licenses antimajori tarian institutions it fails as a democratic charter. In that case, we ought to be better democrats than the framers and insist on strong majority rule. Like the other arguments we are considering, however, this turns on a question-begging non sequitur. Democracy means self-rule; it need not mean majority rule. Genuine self-rule re quires widespread political deliberation; voting as such requires</page><page sequence="8">242 David Luban none. To the extent that the political system responds to sheer numbers of votes—in Hirschman's terms, to voter exit rather than citizen voice—powerful and perverse incentives are gener ated for politicians to create easy escapes for the electorate from the tedious process of deliberation. Contemporary media politics contains many examples of this phenomenon. I do not mean to say that majority rule is a bad idea; I mean only that democratic arguments do not show that it is a good idea. They beg the question by assuming that self-rule means majority rule. Unless majorities display the virtues of democracy, democrats need entertain no special love for majorities. None of the objections I have been rehearsing offers a case against the classical conception of judicial self-restraint, or against majority rule, nor are they intended to. The point is rather to suggest that whatever arguments can be made on behalf of the classical conception must cut deeper than appeals to constitu tional structure, the separation of powers, fidelity to law, or demo cratic ideals. At this point I wish to turn to Holmes, who offers what must surely stand as one of the most amazing arguments ever offered on behalf of the classical conception. Holmes Holmes's views about Thayerism and judicial virtue flow from a unified and deep philosophical outlook. It is generally recognized that Holmes's broader views, for example his self-professed "skep ticism," influenced his philosophy of judging, but my claim is somewhat stronger. I believe that Holmes was a more serious metaphysician and value theorist than is generally supposed, and that his approach to judicial self-restraint emerged from his theory of value.13 Judging from the frequent reflections on these matters in his letters and speeches, what Holmes called his "intimate and ulti mate regions of thought"14 concerned those most philosophical of questions: Does human life have meaning? Do human values pos sess any validity? Holmes was profoundly alive to the possibility that the answer to both questions is no; he once remarked, "We are all very near despair."15 His interest was in spirit and even in details of doctrine and literary timbre very close to Nietzsche's</page><page sequence="9">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 243 problem: How, in a godless world filled up with senseless destruc tion, can one find meaning and avoid sinking into nihilism, "the radical repudiation of value, meaning, and desirability"?16 For Holmes as for Nietzsche atheism is a consequence of a scientific world outlook, and it signals the end not just of religion but of all anthropocentric comforts we may seek in the uni verse.17 As Holmes puts it, "I don't believe in the infinite impor tance of man—I see no reason to believe that a shudder could go through the sky if the whole ant heap were kerosened."18 Medita tion on ultimate matters is a pronounced feature of Holmes's personality, as witness his catalogue of what he takes to be the basic elements of daily life: "victuals—procreation—rest and eternal terror."19 Holmes once wrote that "good &amp; universal (or general law) are synonymous terms in the universe."20 He does not mean that the universe has our interests at heart—far from it, as his remark about kerosening the ant heap makes clear. For Holmes, the "universal laws" governing human affairs are the Malthusian insight that procreation must outstrip the means of existence, and hence the evolutionary law that in the struggle for existence only the fittest will survive. Holmes's equation of "good" and "universal law" means that goodness from the point of view of the universe implies the savage destruction of living beings.21 Holmes does not solve the problem of meaning by insisting that the cosmos is in the least bit benign. Rather, he finds repose in the thought that humanity is not the measure or center of all things, that the universe utterly and finally transcends the hu man scale, including human understanding. Relief comes from the realization that the world, though savage, is unfathomably grand, that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy. This, he writes, "gives us our only but our adequate significance."22 Holmes sometimes refers to his "secret fountain of faith . . . the belief that I am in the universe, not it in me."28 For Holmes, the source of meaning lies, paradoxically enough, in a thought not far removed from a kind of Cartesian doubt: the thought that from the point of view of the universe our strivings may signify something ironically or even ludicrously different from their meaning to us.</page><page sequence="10">244 David Luban For Holmes, that the universe is indifferent to what we hold dear signifies that "one's own moral and aesthetic preferences" are "more or less arbitrary, although none the less dogmatic on that account. Do you like sugar in your coffee or don't you?"24 He often delivers himself of similarly nihilistic opinions about the intrinsic impossibility of reasoning validly to moral judg ments rather than merely fighting over them. "I understand by human rights what a given crowd will Hght for (successfully). . . . When men differ in taste as to the kind of world they want the only thing to do is to go to work killing."25 "I used to say, when I was young, that truth was the majority vote of that nation that could lick all others."26 "Deep-seated preferences can not be ar gued about. . . and therefore, when differences are sufficiently far reaching, we try to kill the other man rather than let him have his way."27 "I don't see that. . . [reason] stands any differ ently from my preference of champagne to ditch water."28 Nevertheless, he contends, we may, as a matter of natural or evolutionary happenstance, be so constituted that we necessarily hold certain beliefs as to the intrinsic worth of many things. Those beliefs we hold, and perhaps must hold, most dear he calls "ideals," and it is ideals that we live for and—more importantly, as we shall see—kill and die for. Yet Holmes consistently main tains that ideals are fictions, though maybe necessary fictions. That we cannot help creating ideals he calls "the trick by which nature keeps us at our job."29 Our ideals do not arise because they point toward objectively, or subjectively, valuable ends. On the contrary, ends are valuable only because they are the objects of ideals. As he remarks in a letter to Lady Castletown, "Nothing could be more enchanting than to see a man nearly killing him self for an end which derives its worth simply from his having affirmed it. You see the pure ideal in the concrete—Nonsensical and sublime."30 This last remark highlights an additional point about Holmes's notion of ideals that is exceptionally strange. Holmes believes that ideals are worthy only to the extent that they are "nonsensical and sublime," that is, unattainable. He speaks rapturously of "ideals the essence of which is that they never can be achieved,"31 and decries as banausic ideals of making people healthier or more</page><page sequence="11">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 245 comfortable, seemingly because they turn us away from more dangerous and unattainable ends. Why does Holmes hold this romantic and self-undermining conception of human ideals? Perhaps he fears that only if we pursue a goal that recedes as swiftly as we advance can nature work its trick of keeping us on the job; the chase is over once the donkey captures the carrot.32 Or perhaps he thinks that only ideals "outreaching the flaming bounds of the possible"33 are able to maintain the discrepancy between us and the transcendent grandeur of the universe in which he finds the solution to the problem of meaning. In any event, it proves to be an important point, a ruling delusion, in Holmes's theory of value that victory is to be won only through the passionate pursuit of self-defeat. Why would pursuit of fictive, unattainable, and intrinsically worthless ideals itself be a source of value? Holmes, I believe, here incorporates an Emersonian idea that proved crucial to Nietzsche as well: the idea that the infusion of "vital force" can transfigure us and lift us out of the etiolated half-experience of daily life.34 Affirmation, vitality, and joy as such amount to the overcoming of nihilism. Holmes expresses this vitalism elo quently in his Memorial Day address, when he speaks of "the great chorus of life and joy."35 Or, more aphoristically: "Life is an end in itself, and the only question as to whether it is worth living is whether you have enough of it."36 It is against this philosophical background that Holmes's view of virtue, and specifically the virtue of doing one's duty, takes shape. He expresses the point in his "Soldier's Faith" address: I do not know the meaning of the universe. But in the midst of doubt, in the collapse of creeds, there is one thing I do not doubt, that no man who lives in the same world with most of us can doubt, and that is that the faith is true and adorable which leads a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty, in a cause which he little understands, in a plan of campaign of which he has no notion, under tactics of which he does not see the use."37 It is a mistake to think that Holmes intends to restrict this concep tion of duty only to soldiers and soldiering. For the argument of</page><page sequence="12">246 David Luban this speech is that the soldier's faith is the sole viable faith for us all. Nor, I think, do I overread the tone of this speech if I suggest that Holmes finds the soldier's faith all the more admirable be cause he is ignorant of why he throws away his life. The hapless and duped draftee has in an important sense fought a better campaign and died a more meaningful death than the thought ful citizen who enlists with open eyes and believes in the cause for which he lays down his life. Holmes's soldier's faith amounts almost to the proposition that a death is more meaningful the more meaningless it is. This paradoxical and even frightening conception of duty makes sense only as a corollary of Holmes's general response to the problem of meaning. To affirm the greatness of the universe is to affirm our own finitude, and this we do by unswerving commitment to a calling that is in an ultimate sense arbitrary. "The rule of joy and the law of duty seem to me all one."38 The virtue of dutifulness consists for Holmes in combining maxi mum intensity with arbitrarily focused narrowness. We must wreak ourselves on life, in his words, even in the face of our ironic appreciation that our ideals are unattainable and our ac tions are senselessly self-defeating and bitterly cruel.39 Ours not to reason why, ours but to do or die. For Kant, the deontological commitment to duty arises as a consequence of "the moral law within." Holmes, for whom ideals are likewise "categorical im peratives,"40 turns deontology into a desperate expedient against despair, by insisting on our duty in the face of full knowledge that no moral law is to be found. This is the central paradox in Holmes's conception of duty. Now I can present the first of my theses about Holmes's phi losophy of judging. For Holmes the virtue underlying judicial self-restraint is precisely the virtue of the soldier: the judge's temptation is to rectify legislative error, and for a judge to hold back is to defer to faulty commandments in the same way that the soldier Holmes glorifies obeys suicidal or ridiculous orders.41 This Holmes conceives to be his duty. As he writes Laski about the Sherman Act, I hope and believe that I am not influenced by my opinion that it is a foolish law. I have little doubt that the country likes it and I</page><page sequence="13">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 247 always say, as you know, that if my fellow citizens want to go to Hell I will help them. It's my job.42 This amazing remark turns us to the second question that a theory of judicial self-restraint must answer. Even granting Holmes's argument about why judicial virtue requires a judge to honor duty over the demands of conscience, we must still deter mine the contours of judicial duty. Judicial self-restraint asks judges to defer to majoritarian institutions; but why? What, ex actly, accounts for the authority of majorities? The question assumes urgency for Holmes, because he rejects a variety of easy answers. A judge so ready to speed his fellow citizens on their chosen path to Hell cannot believe that defer ence to majorities is in itself for the good of the country. Nor does Holmes believe, with Brandeis, the weaker thesis that social experimentation, even with its inevitable failures, is good for the country because the benefits outweigh the risks. As he writes to Brandeis, "Generally speaking, I agree with you in liking to see social experiments tried but I do so without enthusiasm because I believe it is merely shifting the pressure and that so long as we have free propagation Malthus is right in his general view."43 Nor does Holmes believe that majorities exercise a moral claim on our loyalty. Criticizing utilitarianism, he asks rhetorically, "Why should the greatest number be preferred? Why not the greatest good of the most intelligent and most highly devel oped?"44 Presumably Holmes would raise the same questions about majority rule. No less an authority than Felix Frankfurter attributes Holmes's deference to majorities to "humility in passing judgment on the experience and beliefs expressed by those entrusted with the duty of legislating," so that Holmes "reached the democratic result by the philosophic route of scepticism."45 Now it is true that Holmes once wrote Pollock, "I am so sceptical as to our knowledge about the goodness or badness of laws that I have no practical criticism except what the crowd wants."46 Yet as Rogat rightly observes, Holmes holds to his social and economic views with no trace of either humility or scepticism.47 Holmes's humility and skepticism emerged only on a philosophical plane: from the point of view of the universe I can't be sure "that my can't helps which I call. . .</page><page sequence="14">248 David Luban truth are cosmic can't helps,"48 but they are can't helps nonetheless, and Holmes does not doubt them for a moment on the plane of merely human disputation. The very next sentence of his letter to Pollock provides the dry antistrophe to his skepticism: "Personally I bet that the crowd if it knew more wouldn't want what it does— but that is immaterial."49 So much as well for the possibility that Holmes attributed superior wisdom to the majority. Nor does Holmes hold to the popular argument, based on considerations of institutional competence, that courts lack legis latures' fact-finding capabilities. Holmes sees the matter the other way round: rather than founding the duty of deference on courts' supposed ignorance, Holmes makes it almost a point of pride to ignore facts—a point of pride because in his view it is the judge's duty. In the first opinion in which he articulated a theory of judicial self-restraint, his dissent in Commonwealth v. Perry,50 Holmes plausibly explains the legislature's aim in enact ing a statute that the Supreme Judicial Court was voiding, then comments, If their view was true, I cannot doubt that the Legislature had the right. . . , and I cannot pronounce the legislation void, as based on a false assumption, since I know nothing about the matter one way or another.51 The evident sarcasm of this remark prevents us from reading it at face value. Clearly, Holmes is not saying that a judge inevitably knows nothing about the matter one way or another. Rather, he is stressing that a judge's duty prevents him from relying on his own knowledge. Brandeis disagrees with Holmes on this point: his Supreme Court opinions often present lengthy analyses of the economic and social realities underlying legislation.52 As he writes, the reasonableness of state regulations "can ordinarily be deter mined only by a consideration of the contemporary conditions, social, industrial and political, of the community to be affected thereby. Resort to such facts is necessary."53 Holmes complains to Frankfurter that Brandeis "always desires to know all that can be known about a case whereas I am afraid that I wish to know as little as I can safely go on."54 He complains that Brandeis</page><page sequence="15">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 249 adopted too much the attitude of an advocate of the state laws whose constitutionality he was upholding.55 The difference is temperamental as well as principled. Holmes once wrote Frank furter, "I have just received a typewritten report of the U.S. Coal Commission. Brandeis would be deep into it at once. I turn to Sainte-Beuve."56 Whether we agree with Holmes or with Brandeis, however, it is to Holmes's credit that he does not rely on the institutional competence argument that judges cannot find facts as well as legislatures can, for this is mistaken. Trial courts possess the power of subpoena and appellate courts may invite knowledge able parties to submit amicus briefs; courts operate under less stringent time constraints than state legislatures; and courts work relatively free from the political pressures that inevitably lead legislatures to exclude controversial or powerless parties from presenting public testimony. In practice judges possess at least as much fact-finding ability as legislatures. Neither does Holmes rest the policy of deference on the separa tion of powers. It is noteworthy that in Holmes's introduction to a reissue of Montesquieu's Esprit des Lois, he makes only one brief reference to the separation of powers, and that a dismissive re mark that Montesquieu's "England of the threefold division of power . . . was a fiction invented by him."57 Indeed, while Holmes writes Thayer that he "heartily agreed" with his essay on judicial review, which argues for the rule of the clear mistake on separa tion of powers grounds, he adds, "I am not entirely sure that you do not overvalue your formula as a matter of ultimate analysis" and stresses that as a principle of state constitutional law the real reason for judicial deference is that the legislature possesses "the power of Parliament—i.e., absolute power."58 It is in the emphasis on power that we at last come to what I take to be the heart of Holmes's allegiance to majoritarianism. The significance of majorities in Holmes's eyes is that they consti tute the dominant force in the community, and Holmes attrib utes normative authority to the dominant force. He states his argument in two short essays. In each, he appears to offer an independent argument for deferring to dominant forces; but the appearance does not survive a closer reading, and I am</page><page sequence="16">250 David Luban prepared to conclude that Holmes attributes no significance to majorities, dominant forces, beyond dominance itself. One argu ment appears in his essay on Montesquieu: [T]he most perfect government is that which attains its ends with the least cost, so that the one which leads men in the way most according to their inclination is best. . . . What proximate test of excellence can be found except correspondence to the actual equi librium of force in the community—that is, conformity to the wishes of the dominant power? Of course, such conformity may lead to destruction, and it is desirable that the dominant power should be wise. But wise or not, the proximate test of a good government is that the dominant power has its way.59 This argument has deceptive simplicity. Consider the first sen tence. It begins with the seeming truism that the most perfect government attains its ends with the least cost, a proposition that we are inclined to accept without protest because it seems to advocate nothing more than the efficient pursuit of given ends. Who would prefer inefficient pursuit of given ends? But Holmes infers from this a proposition about what ends government ought to adopt, namely those that can be pursued with least cost because they encounter the least opposition. This makes the argument into a non sequitur unless we read "the most perfect government attains its ends with the least cost" not as the proposition that government ought to choose the handiest means to given ends, but rather as the proposition that govern ment ought to choose ends that correspond to the handiest avail able means. But then it is no longer a truism that the most perfect govern ment attains its ends with the least cost. Read as a constraint on the ends, rather than on the means, that government can right fully adopt, Holmes's least-cost rule insists that ends be chosen to minimize possible opposition—to go with the flow. Far from providing an independent economic argument for taking "con formity to the wishes of the dominant power" as the "proximate test for a good government," the least-cost rule merely restates, hence presupposes, that test. Holmes offers a somewhat different defense of "conformity to the wishes of the dominant power" in "The Gas-Stokers'</page><page sequence="17">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 251 Strike." The heart of this brief essay is a methodological criticism of attempting to appraise legislation by asking whether it will promote the good "for society, considered as a whole." Holmes objects "that this presupposes an identity of interest between the different parts of a community which does not exist in the fact."60 Oddly enough echoing Marx, Holmes rejects the very concept of a common good or aggregate public interest, and insists that the only sound criteria for assessing legislation are class relative: The objection to class legislation is not that it favors a class, but either that it fails to benefit the legislators, or that it is dangerous to them because a competing class has gained in power, or that it transcends the limits of self-preference which are imposed by sympathy.61 One must consequently adopt a class standpoint to assess legisla tion. Holmes concludes, as in the Montesquieu essay, "that legisla tion should . . . modify itself in accordance with the will of the de facto supreme power in the community":62 The more powerful interests must be more or less reflected in legislation. ... If the welfare of the living majority is paramount, it can only be on the ground that the majority have the power in their hands. The fact is that legislation ... is necessarily made a means by which a body, having the power, puts burdens which are disagreeable to them on the shoulders of somebody else.63 Holmes argues, in brief, from the necessity of adopting some class standpoint to assess legislation to the necessity of adopting the dominant class's standpoint. Clearly, however, one could just as readily follow Marx and adopt the standpoint of the subordinate class, or for that matter any other class. Holmes's argument therefore presupposes the same normative supremacy of domi nant social forces we find in his analysis based on the least-cost rule. Ultimately, I think that Holmes's writings do not offer a clear explanation of his brute respect for force. His debunking of moral constraints on force, his vision of the limitations of reason, and his skepticism about the common good as well as the possibil</page><page sequence="18">252 David Luban ity of long-term consequentialist prediction—all help to explain why the manifestation of force in law does not repel Holmes; but why does it attract him? My conjecture is that Holmes admires the manifestation of force because he sees in it the vitality and joy that is our salvation from despair. To put it another way, I connect Holmes's ma joritarian commitment to the vitalism I mentioned earlier, his belief that "the only question as to whether [life] is worth living is whether you have enough of it." Nietzsche believes that the world consists of will to power and nothing else. Holmes holds a similar belief: I believe that we are in the universe, not it in us, that we are part of an unimaginable, which I will call a whole, in order to name it, that our personality is a cosmic ganglion, that just as when certain rays meet and cross there is white light at the meeting point, but the rays go on after the meeting as they did before, so, when certain other streams of energy cross, the meeting point can frame a syllogism or wag its tail.64 To affirm the cosmos, then, amounts to affirming the actuality of this energy; hence Holmes's reverence for the dominant force. On this reading, Holmes holds views similar to the conserva tive utopianism described by Karl Mannheim: The fact of the mere existence of a thing endows it with a higher value. . . . "There is something marvellous about experiencing something of which it may be said 'it is!' "65 Holmes puts it less breathlessly and in the negative: "I don't be lieve much in anything that is, but I believe a damned sight less in anything that isn't."66 Moreover, he values vitality, not existence, and therefore transposes conservative utopianism from a static to a dynamic key. But the conservative Utopian's exaltation of the actual over the merely possible, as holding the key to affirmation, hence to redemption from futility, lies at the root of his reverence for dominant social forces and so of majorities. To fly in the face of the majority is to deny the actual and, in Nietzsche's words, to "pass sentence on existence."67 This Holmes was not prepared to do.</page><page sequence="19">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 253 What Do We Make of Holmes? To fault Holmes's views is at once trivially easy and excruciat ingly difficult. Taken in the large, we may find ourselves unable to accept his atheism, or his Emersonian mysticism, or his vi talism, or his irrationalism, or his virtually unargued insistence on the arbitrariness of morality. We may not share his preoccupa tion with the threat of meaninglessness, his "eternal terror" and his sense that "we are all very near despair." If we do share it we may fail to see how the solution can lie, as Holmes thinks it does, in celebrating the indifference of the universe to everything we hold dear. The cosmic indifference that Holmes seizes upon as the solution is, after all, very close to what most of us would take to be the problem. Taken in the small, many of Holmes's views will surely pro voke objections, particularly from analytic philosophers whose business is the careful assessment of arguments. Holmes's system atic blurring of the distinction between reasons and causes, his reduction of value judgments to naked preferences, his deter minism, his bizarre view that ideals cannot be truly worthwhile if they are capable of being achieved, his insistence on pointless deontology, his conservative utopianism, and other aspects of his world view are all deeply problematic. Nevertheless, it is a monumental and inspiring world view, and no useful purpose is served by carping at its margins or even, for that matter, sneering at its grand animating premises, with which we can all partly sympathize. The doubts I wish to raise are of a different nature from direct disputation of the propositions Holmes advances. I wish to ask, first, whether Holmes's views can possibly form a satisfac tory public justification of judicial self-restraint; second, whether they can form a psychologically stable self-conception of the judi cial role; and third, whether the basic metaphors, entirely mili tary, through which he understood social life and even existence as a whole can be accepted. To all three questions I think the answer is no. The point of the first question is that classical judicial self restraint is a public institution and not a private aspect of judicial</page><page sequence="20">254 David Luban deliberation. Public institutions require justifications that are pub licly acceptable, not merely philosophically true. Kant claimed that it is a "transcendental formula of public law" that "all actions relating to the right of other human beings are unjust if their maxim cannot withstand publicity."68 Though this "publicity prin ciple" stands in need of justification that I cannot provide here, it seems plausible that a justification for an institution of public law that would excite widespread and principled condemnation if it were publicized has no place in a democracy. Part of my motive for emphasizing the many similarities be tween Holmes and Nietzsche is to highlight what should be obvi ous: a more eccentric foundation for judicial self-restraint than Holmes's would be hard to find. A form of judicial review based on atheism and cosmic indifference to human aspiration, on the arbitrariness of value judgments, on the contemptibility of at tempting to relieve human suffering through public policy, and on judicial "obedience to a blindly accepted duty" to speed one's fellow citizens on their self-elected path to Hell could not survive the test of publicity. It is scarcely credible that we would accept as a job description of the federal judiciary "that if my fellow citizens want to go to Hell I will help them." Even Americans who back judicial self restraint also expect the federal judiciary to perform acts of statesmanship, to hack through the Gordian knots of legislative stupidity and bureaucratic red tape.69 As government has become larger, more bureaucratized, and more administrative in the decades since the New Deal, the fed eral courts have taken on something of the role of the national complaints department, or, to shift metaphors, of the body poli tics nervous system. When we cannot voice our grievances or obtain redress from politicians and bureaucrats, we go to federal court; when a public policy causes pain, we register that pain through the courts. Though we don't want government by judiciary—or at least we say we don't—we need and expect the federal courts to save government from its own infirmities, includ ing legislatures with short time horizons, the well-known forms of democratic failure, the structural and political inabilities of na tional government to absorb information about past bad choices, and sheer official inertia. This is the point of a widely construed</page><page sequence="21">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 255 judicial role, "judicial activism," and it signals the gulf between our public expectations and Holmes's sardonic credo. If Holmes's views cannot form a palatable public philosophy of judging, perhaps they can still constitute a judge's secret arti cle of faith, as they did for Holmes himself.70 Yet here too prob lems arise. On analogy to Kant's publicity principle, which asks whether a policy can stably be adopted without public deception, we can test a private world view by asking whether an agent can stably maintain it without self-deception. Holmes's outlook fails this test. He writes, "I suspect that all my ultimates have the mark of the finite upon them, but as they are the best I know I give them practical respect, love, etc., but inwardly doubt whether they have any importance except for us."71 But how do we tender practical respect if we are filled with doubts? The secret, accord ing to Holmes, is to allow skeptical doubts only on "the Saturday half-holiday," when we "smile at the trick by which nature has kept us on the job."72 Yet talk of the "trick" that keeps us on the job makes it clear that self-deception lies at the heart of Holmes's "jobbism": to remain committed to the job, we must repress our knowledge of nature's trick. One corollary of Holmes's conception of ideals as the pursuit of "an end which derives its worth simply from his having affirmed it" is that the pursuit itself, not the end pursued, is the real source of value. That, of course, is why he calls fram ing ideals nature's trick rather than merely nature's way of keep ing us on the job. If the pursuit itself is the real source of value, we must in our own conscious designs pursue something else. Pursuing a pursuit as such is meaningless, almost logically impos sible, and thus a fully conscious realization that meaning comes from the pursuit rather than from the end pursued would itself undermine the very condition of meaningfulness by bringing us to a halt. Though Holmes never frames the argument in these terms, the point is closely related to the so-called paradox of hedonism, the fact that one sure way to fail in the pursuit of pleasure is to make pleasure as such the object of the pursuit. Pleasure can emerge only as the byproduct of other activities. In the end, then, Holmes offers a set of philosophical commitments that no judge can maintain without self-deception.</page><page sequence="22">256 David Luban Finally, I wish to point to the most obviously troubling feature of Holmes's philosophy, and indeed his entire authorship: his insistence on understanding the world through military meta phors. The biographical reasons for this are clear: as virtually every writer on Holmes realizes, his Civil War experiences deeply colored his philosophy of life.73 But whatever his reasons for viewing the world as a battle and all of us as soldiers, it should be clear that this leads to a deformation of our thinking about civilian and peacetime matters, including law. When Holmes writes "that all law means I will kill you if necessary to make you conform to my requirements,"74 he fastens on the feature of law most like war, its physical enforcement, and uses it to obscure all other features, for example law as a peaceable alternative to violence. Holmes's military way of thinking enters into every part of his argument for judicial self-restraint. It determines his "soldier's faith" conception of duty, but also his insistence on viewing elec torial majorities as unanswerable military victors, and even his knightly conception of occupational virtue. For our purposes, the most important misunderstanding fos tered by Holmes's militarism is the last of these: his treatment of professional obligations as soldierly duties. The soldier's role is built around the exigencies of combat, chief among them being unquestioned obedience in dangerous situations. In the extrem ity of combat, the demands of discipline overwhelm concerns of conscience. But the same cannot be said of other occupations, including judging. Holmes's literary talents can almost persuade us that the life of the law is a perpetual struggle to the death, and thus that society exists in a permanent state of emergency in which common moral scruples must be set aside by judges who combine knightly honor with soldierly ruthlessness. But—we must say to him—things just aren't that bad. NOTES 1. Part of the confusion arises because the term has come to possess multiple meanings, derived from the mostly polemical purposes into whose service it has been pressed. Especially in the decades since Brown</page><page sequence="23">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 257 v. Board of Education, "judicial self-restraint" has become in popular parlance a kind of conservative code word used for the essentially base purpose of praising judges who are reluctant to interfere with the work ings of white racial prejudice. The best discussion I have seen of the multiple legitimate meanings of the term is Richard Posner, The Federal Courts: Crisis and Reform (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985), pp. 198—222. I attempt to sort out several meanings in "Judicial Activ ism vs. Judicial Restraint: A Closer Look at the Bork Nomination," QQ: Report from the Center for Philosophy &amp; Public Policy, vol. 7, no. 4 (Fall 1987), 9-12.

Nothing could prevent this except a "self-sealing" provision voiding future attempts to supersede or repeal the bill, a self-sealing provision that many theorists believe to be impossi ble.

This letter is one of the crucial documents for understanding Holmes's metaphysics and its connection with moral psychology and the theory of value. Clearly, his anthropomorphic way of speaking about nature is simply shorthand for a nonteleological evolutionary argument: human crea tures possessing ideals are adaptively superior to human creatures who lack ideals, i.e., are more likely to reproduce their kind (perhaps be cause without ideals human beings sink into a kind of despondency that psychosomatically weakens them, or that makes them less attractive mates, or whatever). 30.

Holmes's polemic in this speech against human comfort and the social reformers who take it as their aim, and the contrast he draws between comfort and the "soldier's faith" in violence and danger—and one should read the entire opening passage from which I have taken this extract—is cut from precisely the same cloth as the prologue to Nietzsche's Zarathustra: "I say unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star. . . . Alas, the time is coming when man will no longer give birth to a star. . . . Behold, I show you the last man. 'What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?' thus asks the last man, and he blinks. The earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes everything small. . . . One still works, for work is a form of entertainment. But one is careful lest the entertainment be too harrowing. One no longer becomes poor or rich: both require too much exertion. . . . One has one's little pleasure for the night: but one has a regard for health. 'We have invented happiness,' say the last men, and they blink." (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, in The Portable Nietzsche, ed. and trans. Walter Kaufmann [Viking, 1954], pp. 129-30) 32.

I quote Holmes's letter in its entirety, since as far as I know it has nowhere been published: Dear Thayer I have read your article and I think it admirable. Substantially 1 agree with it heartily and it makes explicit the point of view from which implicitly I have approached Constitutional questions upon which I have differed from some of the other judges. If were to make any criticism it would only be to express a doubt which you have articulated at the bottom of p. 144—I am not entirely sure that you do not overvalue your formula as a matter of ultimate analysis. Of the usefulness of insisting upon it at this time and of dispelling the illusion dealt with in the last sentence of the article I have no doubt. It is idle to rely upon Courts "to save a people from ruin"—And I think that an intelligent dissent by one of my brethren would make me hesitate long in pronouncing an act unconstitutional, because I believe in your formula. There is another principle of state constitutional law not within the scope of your discussion which I always have supposed fundamental but which (between ourselves) I infer from the discussions I have had with my brethren does not command their assent—viz. that a state legislature has the power of Parliament, i.e. absolute power, except so far as expressly or by implication it is prohibited by the Constitution—that the question always is where do you find the prohibition—</page><page sequence="29">JUSTICE HOLMES AND JUDICIAL VIRTUE 263 not, where do you find the power—I think the contrary view dangerous and wrong. I should send the article to Brother Adams if I were you. He may have some suggestions. The passage on the bottom of page 144 of Thayer's article to which Holmes alludes reads, "Will any one say, You are over-emphasizing this matter, and making too much turn upon the form of a phrase? No, I think not." 59. "Montesquieu," in Collected Legal Papers, pp. 257—58. Holmes is here praising Montesquieu's Persian Letters; the passage under discus sion appears in Letter 80: "I have often asked myself what kind of government most conformed to reason. It has seemed to me that the most perfect is that which attains its goal with the least friction; thus that government is most perfect which leads men along paths most agree able to their interests and inclinations" (George R. Healy, trans. [India napolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1964], p. 136). But the subsequent analysis of this passage is pure Holmes: Montesquieu offers this proposition as the premise of an argument on behalf of mild government and moderate punishments, not on behalf of majoritarianism or democracy, a subject that in fact makes no appearance in the letter. 60.
