<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES FOUR LAND ETHICS: ORDER, REFORM, RESPONSIBILITY, OPPORTUNITY By Fred Bosselman* Aldo Leopold's hope that Americans ' thinking would converge to- ward a single land ethic has not been realized. The author , recog- nizing that views on the proper role of land in our society have become increasingly diverse , suggests Leopold's hope for a single ethic is futile. Instead , the author proposes Americans accept that they have inherited multiple land ethics. He explores four land ethics , using a different person as a prototype for each. Sir Thomas Malory's King Arthur of medieval England represents the ethic of order; David Ricardo , English entrepreneur of the Industrial Revolution , represents the ethic of reform; John Muir, American preservationist , represents the ethic of responsibility; and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia represents the ethic of opportunity. The author concludes that each ethic will be an element of any public decisionmaking process having a major impact on land. * Professor of Law, Chicago-Kent College of Law.

Introduction The term "land ethics"1 has found a prominent place in envi- ronmental literature ever since Aldo Leopold rather casually and cryptically coined it in the 1930s.2 If one defines the phrase to mean a system of thought that relates land to ideas of right and wrong, one can identify many prior systems which have achieved prominence at some time or place. Leopold's hope that Americans' thinking would converge to- ward a single land ethic has not been realized. To the contraiy, our debates about land are ever more intemperate and ideological 1. Aldo Leopold first used the term as an organizing concept in July 1947, while putting together some earlier manuscripts in an essay having that title. Curt Meine, Aldo Leopold: His Life and Work 350, 501-03 (1988). Leopold realized that an ethic could only evolve in the minds of a thinking community, and that his own statement of it was tentative. Id. at 504. He died not long after the essay was written, and it was published posthumously in Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac 201 (1949). 2. The Leopold essay has inspired a wealth of commentary. See, e.g., Roderick Frazier Nash, The Rights of Nature: A History of Environmental Ethics 68-74 (1989) [hereinafter Nash, Rights]; Mark Sagoff, The Economy of the Earth 147-50 (1988); Peter S.

The discussions of property tax- es, public land policies, and environmental regulations, for exam- ple, often seem to involve parties who are not really listening to each other because they hold their opponents' views in such disre- spect. These debates will become more rational and less abusive if we attempt to understand how the varying roles that land has played in Anglo-American historical traditions have influenced Americans' attitudes toward land. We have inherited deeply ingrained ethical ideas about land that we can not easily cast aside even if we choose. Any search for a new land ethic needs to understand and play off of our dif- ferent historical attitudes toward land. We need to develop an understanding of land's role in Anglo-American historical tradi- tions to help us create dispute resolution mechanisms that take into account the deeply held values that land represents to differ- ent people. Many different land ethics exercise an important influ- ence over the way people regard land in the United States and I do not intend to postulate an ideal land ethic. Rather, by showing the deep-seated historical origins of four different land ethics, I hope to demonstrate that the search for a single consistent land ethic, for which Leopold hoped, may be futile. Each part of this article focuses on a single individual whose ideas serve as a prototype for a particular land ethic. In Part II, Sir Thomas Malory's semi-legendaiy King Arthur represents the land ethic of medieval England, in which land symbolized order. In Part HI, David Ricardo reflects the changing land ethic in post-Water- loo England, where land was seen as the vehicle for reform. In Part IV, John Muir serves as the spokesman for nineteenth-century preservationists, to whom land represented responsibility. Finally, in Part V, Justice Antonin Scalia expresses the views of modern American utilitarians, for whom land means opportunity. I con- clude that only a pluralistic process in which multiple land ethics are debated will be a satisfactory basis for the resolution of many of the current bitter conflicts over land in America. II. Order: The Land Ethic of Sir Thomas Malory King Arthur, the idealized British ruler3 served as the symbol- 3. Although the shrouds of history mist Arthur's existence, there is reason</page><page sequence="4">1442 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 24:1439 ic embodiment of the land ethic of medieval England - the land ethic of order.4 In the fifteenth century,5 Sir Thomas Malory wrote the most famous version of the story of King Arthur,6 illus- trating that a strong monarch symbolized the end of anarchy be- cause the monarch ruled those who controlled the land. The story of King Arthur reflects the essential role that the control of land played in the maintenance of order. In order to maintain order, the monarch had to ensure that land would be controlled indefinitely by those who owed their loyalty directly to him. The monarch used medieval legal institu- tions, such as entailment, the "real writs, w and the uniqueness of land in equity to do so. However, as English society moved gradu- ally away from a purely agricultural society to a mercantile one, the monarch's control of those who controlled the land decreased. A. Malory's Story of King Arthur In Malory's day, a monarch had the power to allocate land to favored individuals, but with that power the monarch also as- sumed the duty to impose and maintain order within the nation's social structure.7 The instability of the Wars of the Roses and the to believe that in the sixth century, when Arthur lived, land already played a central role in the English social structure. 3 John Morris, The Age of Ar- thur 499-502 (1977).

See generally Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages: A Collaborative History 108-11 (Roger Sherman Loomis ed., 1959). 5. When Malory wrote Morte D'Arthur in 1469-70, the War of the Roses had been raging for almost twenty years. The turbulent era in which Malory wrote was far from the ordered society over which Arthur ruled. See M.C. Bradbrook, Sir Thomas Malory 8-9 (1958); Elizabeth Jenkins, The Mystery of King Arthur 128 (1975). 6. Two slightly different versions of Morte D'Arthur exist, one known as "Caxton" after the name of the original printer (Janet Cowen ed., Penguin Books 1969) [hereinafter Caxton] and the other known as "Vinaver," after the translator of a more recently discovered manuscript (Keith Baines ed., Mentor Books 1962) [hereinafter Vinaver]. 7. The Normans, who ruled England during the middle ages, sought to</page><page sequence="5">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1443 fear of a return to the anarchy of the Dark Ages stimulated a re- newed interest in the King who symbolized the end of anarchy.8 During the so-called Dark Ages of the centuries preceding Malory's day, armed bands moved back and forth across Britain claiming whatever land they could control at any given time. A person who planted grain in the Spring could not be sure who would control the land at the time the grain ripened.9 In these enhance their stature with the British public by identifying with the Britons, who had ruled in the second half of the fifth century and into the sixth centu- ry, before the Saxon invasion. William of Normandy, who conquered England in 1066, took over the traditions of earlier Saxon kings, who in turn traced their traditions back through Alfred the Great to Ethelbert, whose reign began in 561. H.P.R. Einberg, Anglo-Saxon England to 1042 , in 1 The Agrarian History of England &amp; Wales 385, 458-66 (1972). The Saxon laws were super- imposed on the existing land tenure system of the Britons. 3 Morris, supra note 3, at 495-503; Graeme Fife, Arthur the King 62-63 (1991). Modern re- search increasingly discounts the long-accepted assumption that the land tenure system was imposed by the Normans; many historians now believe that most of the basic elements of the system were already in place at the time of the Norman conquest. See , e.g., S.F.C. Milsom, Historical Foundations of the Common Law 100-02, 149-51 (2d ed. 1981). For the earlier view, see for exam- ple, Paul Vinogradoff, English Society in the Eleventh Century: Essays in English Mediaeval History 219-21 (1908). For a discussion of the academic politics of Normanism and Saxonism, see Cantor, supra note 3, at 268-86. 8. Some three centuries earlier, during the reign of another unpopular monarch, a similar revival of interest in King Arthur flourished. The first writ- ten source that brings together the complex of stories we now refer to as the Arthurian chronicles was written in Latin in the year 1136 as Historia Regum Brittanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth and is available today in English transla- tion as History of the Kings of Britain 212-61 (Penguin Books 1966) [herein- after Geoffrey]. See The Arthurian Encyclopedia 209-14 (Norris J. Lacy ed., 1986). Geoffrey's book "might be called the first of the international best sellers." Jenkins, supra note 5, at 60. "Within fifteen years after its publication not to have read [Geoffrey] was a matter of reproach; it became a respected textbook of the middle ages." Dean, supra note 4, at 5. Its publication coincid- ed with the beginning of the almost anarchical reign of King Stephen from 1135 to 1154. 1 Social England 367-72 (H.D. Traill &amp; J.S. Mann eds., 1902); Frank Barlow, The Feudal Kingdom of England 1042-1216, at 202-26 (1955). Geoffrey was also a Norman who used the Arthur stories as a way of tying the Norman kings to the pre-Anglo-Saxon traditions of the British. See Norma Lorre Goodrich, King Arthur 342-44 (1986); Dean, supra note 4, at 7. For examples of twelfth- and thirteenth-century stories in which Arthurian charac- ters were used as surrogates for actual members of the Norman nobility, see D.D.R.

A British monk named Gildas, who presumably grew up</page><page sequence="6">1444 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 24:1439 circumstances it is not surprising that the people would welcome as monarch a powerful person who could bring all of the warring factions under control.10 To accomplish such control, the monarch allocated to the leader of each warring faction ("baron")11 an area of land.12 during Arthur's lifetime, wrote of those years nostalgically as the years when "rulers, public persons and private, bishops and clergy, each kept their proper station," and the "restraints of truth and justice" were still observed. 3 Morris, supra note 3, at 117-18. See also Robert W. Hanning, The Vision of History in Early Britain: From Gildas to Geoffrey of Monmouth 45-46 (1966). Once Arthur was defeated and the Anglo-Saxons took command of what they called "Angleland" or England, the power of the monarch in relation to the thegns diminished and the lawlessness and intimidation by the thegns' armies grew rampant enough to elicit strong condemnation by Gildas. Hodges, supra note 3, at 22-23. References to Arthur virtually disappear during the period of Anglo- Saxon rule that extended with occasional interruptions from the sixth century into the eleventh. 3 Morris, supra note 3, at 132-33.

"The age of Arthur is the beginning of modern British history. . . . The instinct of the middle ages [correctly] be- gan its tradition with Arthur of Britain, the champion of a legendary golden age, the pattern of a just society that should be, but was not . ..." 3 Morris, supra note 3, at 509. 11. The term "baron" is actually shorthand for a much more complex sys- tem of titles that varied in different parts of the country. See 1 Frederick Pollock &amp; Frederic William Maitland, The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I 408-11 (1909); F.M. Stenton, The First Century of English Feudalism, 1066-1166, 83-113 (1932). The Anglo-Saxon equivalent of the baron was commonly known as a "thegn," or "thane" by the time of Shake- speare, but the thegns occupied a similar place in the hierarchy as the later barons. Barlow, supra note 8, at 6-15. Records for the years 931-34 suggest that there were some 120 top thegns who obtained their rights to land directly from the King. Michael Wood, Domesday: A Search for the Roots of Eng- land 106 (1986). 12. Each of the immediate grantees from the monarch then made further allocations to their subordinates, and so on until all land was held in some sort of dependent tenure and the allocation of land became the system for bringing order out of anarchy and imposing a hierarchical social structure throughout Britain. See 1 Pollock &amp; Maitland, supra note 11, at 232-36. The land law in . . . [medieval] England, is a far more important branch of law than it is in modern times. The land is the source of many legal</page><page sequence="7">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1445 Malory's depiction of the coronation of King Arthur symbolizes the key relationship between the monarchy and land: And so anon was the coronation made. And there was he sworn unto his lords and the commons for to be a true king, to stand with true justice from thenceforth the days of this life. Also, then he made all lords that held of the crown to come in, and to do service as they ought to do. And many complaints were made unto Sir Ar- thur of great wrongs that were done since the death of King Uther, of many lands that were bereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentle- men. Wherefore King Arthur made the lands to be given again unto them that ought them.13 As the last leader of the Britons, a people soon to be con- quered by the Saxons, who in turn would be conquered by the Normans, Arthur symbolized14 the heroic, benevolent monarch who created law and order out of anarchy through the divine right to allocate land.15 By the fifteenth century, the beneficent Arthu- rian image contrasted starkly with the factional violence that char- acterized most of the medieval period, and especially the Wars of relations which in modern times would come under such rubrics as justice and police, master and servant, employer and labourer. Therefore, when we say that the royal court is settling the principles of land law ... we say also that it is settling that branch of the law which governed many and varied legal relations of the majority of Englishmen. 2 W.S. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 260 (3d ed. 1923). 13. Caxton, supra note 6, at 20.

For a definition of "knights" see 1 Poli/)CK &amp; Maitland, supra note 11, at 411-12. The use of land grants to reward military leaders continued throughout the middle ages, but other forms of compensation grew more common as land increasingly became scarce. J.M.W. Bean, From Lord to Patron: Lordship in Late Medi- eval England 234-35 (1989). 14. The lack of solid knowledge about whether Arthur's exploits really oc- curred has fueled archaeological exploration, tourism promotion, and the publi- cation of children's books, but it is not the facts of Arthur but the myth of Arthur that is significant. See Michael Wood, In Search of the Dark Ages 60 (1987). See also G.O. Sayles, The Medieval Foundations of England 19-20 (1961); Roger S. Loomis, Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance 350-53 (1967). 15. Fife, supra note 7, at 75-76. Before requiring his knights to swear an oath to uphold the code of honor, Arthur gave them land. "The endowing with lands is important: it placed a knight beyond financial need, which might im- pair his ability to act chivalrously, that is without self-interest."

The countiy had been criss-crossed by armed forces plundering and devastating wherever they went. . . . Amidst all this the hard-headed King William saw his own practical needs as paramount: to maintain his armies with supplies, and to pay them. ... He would milk the English dry if he could. Wood, supra note 11, at 18. William considered himself the legitimate succes- sor to Edward the Confessor through his aunt, Edward's Norman mother, and eventually "consented that the laws of Edward the Confessor, with such addi- tions and alterations as he thought proper to make, should in all things be ob- served." George Crabb, A History of English Law 44-45 (Burlington, Chauncey, Goodrich, 1831). For a discussion of the role of knights in Norman society and in King Arthur's times, see F.M. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England 556 (1989), and Sayles, supra note 14, at 19-20. 20. After the Anglo-Saxons conquered Arthur's Britons in the sixth century, they maintained "rigorous distinctions of personal status" which were carefully reflected in their hierarchy of landownership. Stenton, supra note 11, at 5. The Norman conquest in 1066 merely substituted new Norman names for the previous landowners and made a stronger, more centralized role for the King. See Milsom, supra note 7, at 79; 1 Marc Bloch, Feudal Society 188-89 (1961). The first two decades following the Norman Conquest were characterized by a tremendous shift in land ownership, which consolidated the increasingly manorialized land tenure of England into a system of estates held from the King by tenants. Wood, supra note 11, at 64. A Norman aristocracy had been planted on the estate of Englishmen who had fallen in the war of the Conquest or failed to make terms with the king in the settlement after his coronation. ... On every hand the</page><page sequence="9">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1447 and grew more confident of the stability of their reign, the rigid distinctions among the levels of society gradually relaxed.21 But the keystone of the medieval system, the strong monarch, attained a transcendental status.22 By the sixteenth century, it was accept- English lords who had survived the Conquest must have felt their insig- nificance in comparison with the acquisitive aliens on whose support the king in fact relied. Stenton, supra note 19, at 625-27. The barons under William the Conqueror merely took over "the familiar form of social order by which the men of a village maintained their lord's household by rent or labour in return for his protection and for the justice done in his hail." Stenton, supra note 11, at 114. William scattered his land grants so that no individual baron would be too powerful in any one region. G.E. Mingay, A Social History of the English Countryside 15 (1990). The Domesday Book , the great survey of the land of England, which was completed some twenty years after the Norman conquest, see Wood, supra note 11, at 17-25, reflected a custom well under way; that is, the process of "subinfeudation," by which the barons granted to their soldiers or knights small land holdings around the baronial residence so that they would be available for immediate service if the need arose. Austin Lane Poole, Obligations of Society in the XII and XIII Centuries 4-5 (1946); Stenton, supra note 11, at 143-44; Bolton, supra note 18, at 37. These knights, in turn, would grant even smaller land parcels to tenants who did the actual farming. Reginald Lennard, Rural England 1086-1135: A Study of So- cial and Agrarian Conditions 40-104 (1959). Domesday Book shows that all but a small proportion of the English people worked the land. Indeed, four-fifths of the recorded heads of household in 1086 are dependent labourers of some sort, ranging from the villein class - over a third of the entire population - through bordars, cottars, burs and slaves or serfs (servi), the last class amounting to nearly a tenth of the recorded population. Wood, supra note 11, at 149. Many tenants were free farmers bound to the land only by custom, but others, called villeins, were tied to the land in a manner akin to slavery. Poole, supra, at 12-15; Mingay, supra , at 13-14. Eng- lish kings continued to use land grants to reward supporters well into the fourteenth century. Asa Briggs, A Social History of England 84 (1983). 21. 2 Holdsworth, supra note 12, at 56. Slavery declined precipitously during the twelfth century as the Norman rule stabilized. See J.

See , e.g., A.L Brown, The Governance of Late Medieval England, 1272-1461, at 5 (1989) (the king was the "heart and driving force" of English government). See Thomas Hobbes, n Leviathan Ch. 17 (1651). In comparison to other European countries, the English system of land tenure was the most monarch-dominated. "In this country where every piece of land was a tene- ment, the king was literally the lord of all the lords." 2 Bloch, supra note 20, at 430. See Peter N. Riesenberg, Inalienability of Sovereignty in Medieval Political Thought 14-15 (1956).

The Monarch's Control of the Land: Land, as Territory The key attribute of land to the monarchs and barons of medieval England was its boundaries, which ensured that the realm would be controlled by those barons whom the monarch trusted: "These obligations incidental to feudal tenure . . . reflect a time when the king must control the private as well as the public lives of his subjects. These men were endowed with wealth and power which the king could not allow to be transmitted to un- trustworthy hands."32 The territorial relationships33 among the human occupants, which treated each piece of land alike, regard- less of its productive potential or lack thereof,34 filled the need pre-Roman times, to illustrate the folly of royal weakness. Seeking to retire after a sixty-year reign, Lear decided to divide his kingdom between his three daughters. While his two eldest daughters encouraged such a division, promis- ing their father that they would continue to treat him royally, his youngest daughter, Cordelia, warned against this precipitous act. Cordelia's opposition angered the king and he divided the country between his two older daughters and sent Cordelia to be married to the King of France. The two older daughters soon forgot their promise and Lear was compelled to flee to France. In France, Lear beseeched Cordelia to help him recover his kingdom. A French army put Lear, and subsequently Cordelia, back on the British throne. This story reflects the essential role that control of land played in the maintenance of order.

To use an ethological analogy, an animal uses land as both territory and habitat. Its territory represents the boundaries of land from which it excludes other animals of the same species. Remy Chauvin, Animal Societies 161-62 (1968). The behavioral patterns by which animals attain and defend their territories from each other are analogous to the medieval rules of land tenure.

Thus, medieval legal institutions were designed to deter disruption of land ownership patterns; these in- stitutions included entailment, the "real writs," and the "unique- ness" of land in equity. Entailment, which placed conditions or limitations on succes- sion to property, served that purpose by making it very difficult for the nobility to sell their land.42 Under entailment, a family, not an individual, owned land. On the death of the current scion it passed automatically to the next member of the family in line to inherit.43 dal," but as Richard Lazarus has recently reminded us, the term is ours, not theirs, and it has a confusing array of connotations.

Powelson, The Story of Land: A World History of Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform 51 (1988). Under the Normans, the practice of subinfeudation was used to elude the feudal restraint on alienation, "but ... no subinfeudation was permitted of part of the land, unless sufficient was left to answer the services due to the superior lord." 2 J.H. Thomas, Lord Coke's First Institute of the Laws of England % (A), at 274 (Philadelphia, Robert H. Small 1827). Some historians believe that the eva- sion of primogeniture and entailment was common as early as the thirteenth century, but the evidence of an active market for land during this period is sketchy. Alan McFarlane, The Origins of English Individualism 124-29 (1978); McKissack, supra note 38, at 257-61. 43. The doctrine of primogeniture perpetuated the possessions of the no- bility in their own families. If lands were held by knight's service or military tenure, then, according to the law of the realm, the eldest son succeeded to the father in totum. . . . When a man left several daughters . . . his inheritance was equally divided amongst them. . . . When a man died without leaving ei- ther a son or a daughter, his grandchildren, if he had any, were to suc- ceed him ... for it was then the law of succession . . . that the de- scendants in the right line were to be preferred to those in the collat- eral line.

And except for the few whose lands were located at the site of a mineral deposit or a growing urban area, rent could be received only from fanners who used the land for agricultural purposes.44 Consequently, although the nobility were assured of a steady source of income, they were discouraged from entrepre- neurial wealth-seeking in favor of playing their family's role as the symbol of law and order.45 Although entailment provided the vehicle for perpetuating the feudal system of social control, procedures for enforcing it were also needed. As the population increased, writs and charters from the monarch could no longer be used to resolve every dispute. Judges were necessary to handle the growing number of cases, and rules of law were needed to guide their decisions.46 The "real law inevitably meant the concentration of ever greater estates in the hands of fewer landlords . . . throughout the later Middle Ages."

From the earliest settlements until the industrial revolution the economic basis of society was agrarian. Land was wealth, livelihood, family provi- sion, and the principal subject matter of the law. ... A generation or so after the Conquest, a single plot of land may have been in some sense the property of several different people: a peasant, the lord of his manor, the lord's lord, the King.

M[S]ocial distinctions were permanently fixed through the hereditary nature of land tenure. . . .

See Eue Halevy, England in 1815, at 181, 221-24 (2d ed. 1949). Because the lord depended on the agricultural workers for income, the workers ei'joyed economic security.

As English society moved gradually away from a purely agri- cultural society toward a mercantile one, the courts increasingly resolved disputes by awarding damages.50 The idea of the damage award posed a threat to the social stability embodied in existing patterns of land ownership because it meant that entailed land could be transferred to a new owner, and the heirs of the seller 100. At first, the remedies given by English law were not limited by a fixed register of writs. The king's judges were not tied so strictly to the rules of substantive law or to rules of procedure that could not do equity." 2 Holdsworth, supra note 12, at 246. Holdsworth says that the specific relief given at this period in the common law courts was not based upon the same principles as those upon which the Court of Chancery in later days granted specific performance. The common law courts granted specific relief on the ground that "a wrong was committed if the particular interest in land were used in such a way," not upon the personal ground that the defendant's con- duct was inequitable. Relief of a real or specific kind was granted because "the very nature of the action pre-supposed and demanded it." Id. at 246-49. 47. Baker, supra note 42, at 203-04.

During the second half of the eighteenth century a market economy began to emerge in England marked by the development of a national com- modities market. As the market for grain became regional instead of local, money was used more often as a means of exchange and goods came to be thought of as fungibles. The first recognition of expectation damages appeared after 1790 in cases involving speculation in stock. See Morton J. Horwttz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860, at 174 (1977) [hereinafter Horwitz I].

The rule was that land is unique, and an award of damages is not adequate relief to a person who was entitled to land.52 51. See Donald R. Denman, Origins of Ownership 132-33 (1958). The tenant who cannot be put out, and whose heirs will have a right protected by the external law of the king's court, is on the way to hav- ing something that we should call ownership. But it is not until he can give his land away, or sell it and keep the proceeds for himself, that the tenurial relationship finally becomes unreal; and the stages by which this happened are not altogether clear. Milsom, supra note 7, at 110. 52. As rules of procedure became more rigid, the equitable characteristics of the old common law courts began to decay. 2 Holdsworth, supra note 12, at 334. One of the causes for decay was the new rule that new writs must be sanctioned by statute and that statutes should have the sanction of Parliament. Id. at 335. "'Every writ brought in the king's court,' it was said in 1294, 'ought to be formed according to the common law or statute."* Id. However, the judg- es were not anxious to abandon their equitable jurisdiction right away, so in 1294 the following rule was adopted: "'Where one comes to the Chancery and prays a remedy ... no remedy having been previously provided, then, in order that no one may quit the court in despair, the Chancery will agree on the form of a writ ....'" Id. Since the specific relief given by the common law was conditioned on the technical rules relating to real actions, and cases had arisen which showed that these principles were too narrow, the common law courts drove litigants to the Chancery. Id. at 345. There are many cases in which if a contract be broken no amount of damages that a jury will give will be a sufficient remedy to him who suffers by the breach. A man for example agrees to buy land, and he agrees perhaps to give more for it than anyone else would have given. The seller refuses to perform his part of the agreement, it may be that no damages that could be given to the buyer would be a just compensa- tion to him for his loss. What damages can you give? Even if a land can be said to have a market value, still a man may well have consent- ed to pay more than its market value and yet be very anxious that the agreement should be performed; to him the land has a fancy value.

The authors discuss the exception to the general rule that contracts will not be specifically enforced in equity unless the remedy at law is inade- quate. The exception is that equity will grant specific performance of contracts to convey real estate regardless of legal remedies and their adequacy of relief.

The Decrease of the Monarch's Control: Land as Habitat Land provided the English people with habitat as well as territory. As the centuries elapsed, the economic productivity of land grew increasingly diverse, keeping apace with the growing complexity of human society; consequently, the economic benefits that accompanied different noble fiefdoms varied greatly. A minor baron who married into the wealthy gentry and whose land hap- pened to include what became the fashionable quarter of rapidly- expanding London became fabulously wealthy,53 while many a land-rich north country noble hunted grouse in patched clothes.84 But despite their economic differences, these nobles saw them- selves as occupying the same rank in the social order; they sat next to each other in the House of Lords and sent their children to the same schools.55 The amassing of land was not limited to the nobility. Al- though English legal institutions sought to inhibit the breaking up of the nobility's landholdings, they never became draconian enough to counteract completely the natural tendency of individu- al barons to trade land for other assets of choice.58 The assembly of this land by individuals who lacked noble birth but possessed substantial amounts of land - the nobility's primary asset - led to the creation of what became identified as a new social class, the "gentry."57 Like the nobility, the landed gentry identified with Id. at 380 (quoting Kitchen v.

In the early feudal period many of them were serfs, but even as prosperity increased and they obtained more legal rights, they found few opportunities to acquire land.63 The land remained in them to raise cash.

He argued that rent was simply a windfall that was captured by the lucky land- owner whose land had been endowed by nature with better pro- ductivity or accessibility than marginal sites. This argument sup- ported the drive of entrepreneurs for political gain against the landed classes of the nobility and the gentry. In America, Thomas Jefferson shared Ricardo's objections to the restrictive English system of land ownership. Yet, most Ameri- can commentators thought Ricardo's theory of economic rent had limited applicability to the New World because America had few absentee landowners and wealth and power were increasingly concentrated in entrepreneurs, the owners of liquid capital needed to make the country self-sufficient. However, with the post-Civil War westward expansion and the resulting settlement and cultiva- tion of increasingly marginal land, American commentators re- vived Ricardo's theories. One commentator, Henry George, carried Ricardo's theory of economic rent further than Ricardo would ever have expected. 68. Mingay, supra note 36, at 12, 51; Halevy, supra note 45, at 180.

Ricardo the Entrepreneur During the Industrial Revolution in England, the newly wealthy entrepreneurs sought to reform government policies that favored the old money of the landed nobility and gentry over the new money of the manufacturers,70 such as the tariffs on foreign agricultural products.71 Because the primary source of income for the nobility and gentry was rents collected from the tenant farm- ers who cultivated the land,72 it was in their interest to keep the price of farm products high. The entrepreneurs, believing that high food prices were forcing them to pay workers higher wages,73 sought to make imports of farm products cheaper.74 One of the most eloquent spokesmen for reform on behalf of the entrepreneurs was David Ricardo.75 The son of a prominent financier, Ricardo left school at age fourteen to pursue a career in finance.76 He was sufficiently successful at forty-two to be able to retire to his country estate77 and pursue his hobby of "political 70.

Ricardo's Theory of Economic Rent Ricardo's brief period in the public eye began in 1815, a wa- tershed year in European history, when the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo ended the protracted Napoleonic Wars. England bor- rowed unprecedented sums to finance the conflict, and the burden of this debt limited government options for acļjusting to peacetime conditions.84 Englishmen were restive under the high taxes which were needed to finance the war effort.88 The resumption of high tariffs on grain (the "Corn Laws")86 resulted in the Corn Law ri- ots of 1815-16, in which mobs attacked members of Parliament and other government officials.87 Ricardo argued against the Corn Laws in his writings and from his seat in Parliament.88 He articulated a platform for 84.

Therefore, no land would yield economic rent until poorer land is cultivated, because rent is the component of the landowner's income that is attributable to the fact that his or her land is of higher quality than some other land. He argued that when a country is first settled and land is freely available, the produce of land "will belong to the owner of such capital [invest- ed to produce it] without any deduction for rent."92 But as it be- comes necessary to till more distant and less fertile land, the own- er of the better land will be able to charge rent; this "rent would rise on the land previously cultivated, and precisely in the same degree profits would fall."93 To Ricardo, land was not just territory in the feudal sense, it was habitat, a scarce natural resource, the quality of which dif- fered greatly from parcel to parcel.94 By providing the public with a simple formula that appeared to correlate the increase in eco- nomic rent with the amount of marginal land put into cultiva- tion,95 he put a spin on the issue that could be translated into soundbites at the local ale-house.96 TiON (3d ed. 1817), reprinted in [Volume I: On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation] The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo 174 (Piero Sraffa ed., 1953). 92.

Bagehot, supra note 81, at 167.</page><page sequence="27">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1465 This idea of "economic rent" was designed to put the landed magnates in a less deserving posture than the entrepreneurs; the magnates' fortunes varied with the fortuitous attributes of their land holdings rather than with the skill of their investment. In this manner, Ricardo made a theoretical basis for a distinction be- tween land and capital that served as the linchpin for land re- form.97 Ricardo argued that high tariffs on farm products unfairly in- creased the income of the landed magnates at the expense of the other classes: If we import [corn,] the portion of the capital last employed on the land, and which yielded no rent, will be withdrawn; rent will fall and profits rise. ... If corn can be imported cheaper than it can be grown on this rather better land, rent will again fall and profits rise, and another and better description of land will now be cultivated for profits only. In every step of our progress, profits of [capital] stock increase and rents fall, and more land is abandoned . . . .98 97. The produce of the earth - all that is derived from its surface by the united application of labour, machinery, and capital, is divided among three classes of the community; namely, the proprietor of the land, the owner of the stock or capital necessary for its cultivation, and the labourers by whose industry it is cultivated. I Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, supra note 91, at 5. Ricardo's unique contribution was to demonstrate that agriculture required all three social functions: capital, labor, and landownership.

[Ricardo] dramatized the conflict of interests between landlords and the other social classes: Under a system of agricultural protection, diminish- ing returns in agriculture would cause the distribution of income to shift in favor of the landlords and against the receivers of profits. Since profits were the prime mover of progress, the long run effect of the corn laws would be a stationary economy. The issue was cheap corn and (industrial) progress versus high priced corn, high rents and an end to economic expansion. Pagun, supra note 83, at 89.

Although the unfailingly generous Ricardo credited Malthus with the origination of the theory of economic rent, and other political economists of the day were using similar concepts, his contemporaries credited Ricardo with the theory and it became associated with his name. See IV Ricardo, An Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock , supra note 79, at 4-6. The Ricardian definition of rent was expanded on by other econo- mists, and remains a continuing source of the difficulty economists have in communicating with the outside world.

See generally Gudeman, supra note 83, at 55-56. Tribe, supra note 17, at 118-22. Ricardo left little indication of his ethical attitude toward the natural world. His early retirement from investment banking to an estate in the coun- try seems to have created an ambivalence toward agrarian values. In a letter to a friend written shortly after his purchase of the estate he wrote that he intended to Mei'joy the calm repose of country life" but MI am not yet become a farmer.

The American Reaction to Ricardo Following the publication of Ricardo's works, Americans studied his theories.104 An American edition of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation appeared shortly after its pub- lication in England,105 and for many years American writers on political economy used the Ricardian view on any issue as the accepted doctrine to be supported or attacked.106 Many Ameri- can commentators accepted Ricardo's theory of economic rent as valid for England but inapplicable to conditions in the United States because of land's unique role in the "New World."107 Americans initially saw land as habitat more than territo- ry.108 Ever since the first settlements were made, the dream of 101.

The high value attached to landownership by the colonists is best under- stood in terms of the English experience. In England, as in western Eu- rope generally, land was the principal source of wealth and social status. Yet landownership was tightly concentrated in relatively few hands, and most individuals had no realistic prospect of owning land.

Arriving there in April, 1867, he almost immediately headed toward the Sierra mountains and reached the valley with which he will always be associated, Yosemite.'72 Muir saw the land as a temple.173 His magazine articles174 Clarke, supra note 158, at 57. 168.

Why should man value himself as more than a small part of the one great unit of creation? . . .

Where one might hope to see God."180 Of a grove in which he syllabic, circumlocutory mush, Muir wrote a lean, direct prose, bristling with the energy of hard, Anglo-Saxon words and occasional striking neologisms.

It draws me so strongly, I would make any sacrifice to try to read its lessons."182 As Frederick Turner points out in his biography, Muir never fully formulated a land ethic: "At the outset, Muir felt himself un- prepared to develop what amounted to a land ethic, and indeed, long after he had become a legend and a symbol of the preservationist cause, there remained a kind of quizzicality to his public utterances."183 But Muir embodied a land ethic, serving as a role model for those who would rather experience Muir's ecstat- ic lessons from nature than theorize about them.184 The "back- packer," lean, fit and serious, driving to and past exhaustion, ex- presses the unique mixture of Calvinism and pantheism that John Muir embodied.185 Muir's writings186 greatly influenced the creation of the na- tional park system187 and the growth of tourism as an economic incentive to preserve natural areas.188 His writings also inspired 181.

Our govern- ment ... is like a rich and foolish spendthrift who has inherited a magnificent estate in perfect order, and then has left his fields and meadows, forests and parks, to be sold and plundered and wast- ed."196 Muir grudgingly realized that if public support was to be ob- tained for preservation of natural areas more people needed to visit these areas and share the experience with their friends.187 With Theodore Roosevelt's unexpected accession to the presiden- cy upon McKinley's death in 1901, Muir found a promising audi- ence for his preservation message.198 In 1903, Roosevelt visited Yosemite, where he and Muir camped for three nights in the Mariposa Grove, accompanied only by two rangers and a cook.199 Roosevelt agreed with Muir that Yosemite should become a na- tional park under federal control, and Muir helped guide the legis- lation that accomplished this in 1905-06.200 For the next few years, the death of Muir's wife and the ill- ness of his daughter sapped his energy.201 Meanwhile, the City of San Francisco was making new plans to build a dam and reservoir in Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley to provide drinking water for the rapidly growing city, a project that Muir had bitterly opposed less from the originality of his thinking (although his own variant was unique) than from the inspirational quality of his prose and from his personal stature as a role model who both lived and described the wilderness experience.

It is about seven miles long, half a mile to a mile wide, and nearly a mile deep in the solid granite flank of the range. The walls are made up of rocks, moun- tains in size, partly separated from each other by side canons, and they are so sheer in front, and so compactly and harmoniously arranged on a level floor, that the Valley, comprehensively seen, looks like an immense</page><page sequence="47">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1485 lifelong distaste of politics and his preference for the contempla- tive life, to participate in the arena where land use decisions are made.209 V. Opportunity: The Land Ethic of Antonin Scalia The land ethic of opportunity greatly contrasts with Muir's preservationist vision of the land and ethic of responsibility. To- day the most important exponent of the land ethic of opportunity is Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia210 The roots211 of hall or temple lighted from above. But no temple made with hands can compare with Yosemite. Every rock in its walls seems to glow with life. Some lean back in majestic repose; others, absolutely sheer or nearly so for thousands of feet, advance beyond their companions in thoughtful attitudes, giving welcome to storms and calms alike, seemingly aware, yet heedless, of everything going on about them. Awful in stern, immovable majesty, how softly these rocks are adorned, and how fine and reassuring the compa- ny they keep: their feet among beautiful groves and meadows, their brows in the sky, a thousand flowers leaning confidingly against their feet, bathed in floods of water, floods of light, while the snow and wa- terfalls, the winds and avalanches and clouds shine and sing and wreathe about them as the years go by, and myriads of small winged creatures- birds, bees, butterflies - give glad animation and help to make all the air into music. Down through the middle of the Valley flows the crystal Merced, River of Mercy, peacefully quiet, reflecting lilies and trees and the onlooking rocks; things frail and fleeting and types of endurance meeting here and blending in countless forms, as if into this one mountain mansion Nature had gathered her choicest treasures, to draw her lovers into close and confiding communion with her.

Born in 1936, Justice Scalia attended the University of Fribourg, Swit- zerland, Georgetown University (A.B. summa cum laude 1957) and Harvard University Law School (LL.B. magna cum laude 1960). After graduation, he practiced in Cleveland until 1967 when he joined the University of Virginia law faculty in Charlottesville. He took a leave to serve as the General Counsel of Telecommunications Policy from March 1971 to September 1972. Upon return- ing to Charlottesville, he served as the part-time Chairman of the Administra- tive Conference of the United States from September 1972 to August 1974, when he left the faculty to become Assistant Attorney General. He left that position to serve as Professor of Law at the University of Chicago from 1977 until 1982. He was appointed by President Reagan to the circuit court in 1982 and to the United States Supreme Court in 1986. See 2 Who's Who in America</page><page sequence="48">1486 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 24:1439 Scalia's land ethic trace back to the utilitarian ideas of Jeremy Bentham, an English writer who was a Mend and contemporary of James Mill and David Ricardo.212 These ideas can be seen in Scalia's judicial opinions. In particular, his opinion in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council213 shows his view that land should be protected from government regulation to a greater de- gree than personal property. However, Scalia's opinions do not reflect a pure libertarian viewpoint; Scalia supports incidental and reciprocal government regulation of land. A. The Roots of Scalia's Land Ethic: Bentham and, Utilitarianism Bentham's "utilitarianism" attracted attention because it ap- parently reduced ethics to a simple proposition: an action is good if it contributes to maximizing the happiness of the greatest num- ber of human beings.214 Government's only role, Bentham ar- (45th ed. 1988-1989). 211. One scholar has attributed the origins of Scalia s textualist approach to the influence of his father, who emigrated from Italy and became a professor of languages and literature in Brooklyn. George Kannar, The Constitutional Catechism of Antonin Scalia , 99 Yale L.J. 1297, 1308 n.53 (1990). Scalia's fa- ther believed that literalness was essential and "was so skeptical of the value of translation that he doubted the worth of his profession." Id. at 1316. 212. Halevy, supra note 45, at 577-83. "Englishmen wanted a theory which would sustain liberal reforms but ward off revolution. The natural rights theo- ry, connected in men's minds with the Revolution in France, was not respect- able; the Benthamites publicized the utilitarian theory and it served the pur- pose." Richard Schlatter, Private Property: The History of An Idea 245 (1951). See also Margaret Jane Radin, The Liberal Conception of Property: Cross Currents in the Jurisprudence of Takings , 88 COLUM. L. Rev. 1667, 1683- 84 (1988). 213. 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992). 214. The simple core of all Benthamism consisted of just this series of propositions: (1) all that human beings, universally, want from life can be summed up as the greatest obtainable amount of happiness, or sum of pleasures, and avoidance, as fully as possible, of unhappiness, pains, or displeasures; (2) the good or right or ideal conduct of life is simply its intelligent conduct, to maximize the pleasure and minimize the pain experienced in or from all the results of all one's actions, choices, or decisions; (3) the social problem is simply that of so arranging society's institutions and laws and the relations and interactions among its mem- bers, that for everyone the course of action most beneficial to himself</page><page sequence="49">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1487 gued, was to attach sufficient pain to "bad" human actions so that those actions would be deterred.216 For example, the theft of another's property was bad, but not because it transferred the pleasure received from that property from one person to another; such a transfer was merely a neutral action under Bentham's felicific calculus.216 But theft was bad because it detracted from the pleasure people obtained from the assumption that their property was secure.217 And the legitimacy will always be the one most beneficial to his fellows also, and deterrent penalties of self-ir'jury will be attached to all courses injurious to others; and, finally, (4) all this can be achieved by creating and applying an exact science of ethics, jurisprudence, and politics, using as its master tool a (Bentham's) "felicific calculus" of the relative quantities of plea- sure and pain to be expected as results of different private and public actions, and so of the pattern of all actions required to bring about "the greatest happiness of the greatest number." Taylor, supra note 75, at 120. Although Bentham's perspective was an- thropocentric, he argued for legislation to protect animals and an end to cruel- ty toward animals. His argument was based on his observation that animals are sentient creatures that seek pleasure and avoid pain. Mighetto, supra note 188, at 43. For a discussion of Bentham's view on the ethical status of animals' pain, see Nash, Rights, supra note 2, at 23. Bentham also applied his utilitarian principles to slavery. "It is absurd to attempt showing that a man ought to be happy when he is actually miserable; and that a condition into which no one wishes to enter, and from which ev- eryone wishes to escape, is a condition good in itself . . . Jeremy Bentham, The Theory of Legislation 202 (C.K Ogden ed. 1931) (1840). Another utilitari- an rationale for rejecting slavery was the idea that "slave labour in the ab- sence of security and incentives was likely to be less productive than paid free labour." H.L. Hart, Essays on Bentham 97 (1982). 215. Peter J. King, Utilitarian Jurisprudence in America 10-11 (1986). Bentham thought that government was a necessary evil and that its only justifi- cation was that "its coercive action creates less pain than it prevents." John Plamenatz, The English Utilitarians 82-83 (1949). He devoted his life to criticizing existing institutions and to advocating reforms that would produce as much happiness as possible. When some of his reforms were rejected, he con- cluded that "[t]he actual end of every government is the greatest happiness of the governors." Id. at 82. 216. "[T]he disutility caused by theft can only be explained by reference to the expectations of the owner, the expectation to retain possession indefinite- ly." Gerald J. Postema, Bentham and the Common Law Tradition 169 (1986). See also John Dinwiddy, Bentham 104 (1989). Bentham's felicific calculus is the theory that men estimate the consequences of alternative possible actions and then choose to perform the one which is likely to produce the greatest happiness. Plamenatz, supra note 215, at 74. For a further explanation of this calculus, see note 224 and accompanying text. 217.

The German philosopher Schopenhauer claimed that the "English philosophers talk about happiness, but they mean money."220 Some utilitarians agree, and some support var- ious other measures of "utility" or "welfare."221 But despite inter- (1948). Bentham said that property, considered with respect to the proprietor, always implies a benefit. "On the part of the proprietor, it is created not by any commands that are laid on him, but by his being left free to do with such or such an article as he likes. The obligations it is created by, are in every in- stance laid upon other people." Id. at 229. 218. Bentham believed that property is entirely the creation of law, and should be given to the person whose lawful expectation of having it is the strongest. Postema, supra note 216, at 153, 184-87. For a discussion of Bentham's views on reform of land law, see Mary Sokol, Jeremy Bentham and the Real Property Commission of 1828 , 4 Utiutas 225 (1992). Bentham set out a scheme for a new basis for property rights. Instead of basing property rights on feudal concepts of tenures and estates, he wanted to base property law on the notion of rights and obligations. Id. at 243. He wanted to abandon the concept of tenures because it retained the feudal fiction that "all land is granted by and held from the Monarch in return for services." For Bentham, ownership of property depended on the law: "Property and law are born to- gether and must die together. Before the laws, there was no property: take away the laws, all property ceases."

Id. This article ignores the many distinctions among modern branches of utilitarian theory. 222. See, e.g., T.L.S. Sprigge, The Greatest Happiness Principle , 3 Utiutas 37 (1991). The classical utilitarians equated "happiness" with pleasure and the absence of pain: "[One can] identify being happy with being in a state of con- sciousness whose overall quality is pleasurable, while being unhappy is being in a state whose overall quality is unpleasant . . . Id. at 40-41. 223. Bentham contrasted the notions of liberty and security. Postema, su- pra , note 216, at 170. He defined liberty as "the state of actually being free from restriction and constraint." Id. at 171. However, he said that unsecured liberty was of little value: "[W]hat we need (for coherence in our own lives) is a reasonable basis for predicting our own individual futures, and this comes not from the mere possession, but from the sure knowledge , of that liberty." Id. at 171. 224. Bentham's felicific calculus was a method for valuing pleasures and pains, the legislative ends of his utilitarian philosophy. He proposed: "To a person considered by himself, the value of pleasure or pain considered by it- self ' will be greater or less, according to the four following circumstances: 1. Its intensity. 2. Its duration. 3. Its certainty. ... 4. Its propinquity or re- moteness. ... 5. Its fecundity. ... 6. Its purity. " When considering the value of pleasure or pain to a number of persons, Bentham adds a seventh factor, "7. Its extent ." Bentham, supra note 217, at 29-32. Bentham admitted that his calculations might seem fictitious. "'Tis in vain to talk of adding quantities which after addition will continue as distinct as they were before, one man's happiness will never be another man's happiness. . . . [Y]ou might as well try to add 20 apples to 20 pears.'" He argued, however, that "[t]his addibility of the happiness of different subjects" was a necessary starting point for political reasoning. Dinwiddy, supra note 216, at 49-53. 225. "In [Bentham's] eyes, 'Give people as great a sum of pleasures as possible' and 'Give them what they want in the order of their preferences' are equivalent rules." 2 John Plamenatz, Man and Society 12 (1992). 226.

The motives of these immigrants, who took advan- tage of the opportunity to use the land in a way that they thought was more productive than the way their predecessors had used it, could now be justified by their descendants in the name of utili- tarian efficiency. B. Scalia's Judicial Opinions Reflect Bentham's Ideas Scalia's attitudes toward land seem to be squarely grounded in Bentham's concepts: anthropocentrism, tradition, and opportu- nity. The anthropocentrism, against which John Muir rebelled, has played a mgjor role in some of Scalia's court decisions.228 In the note 2, at 155-80 (arguing that utilitarianism furnishes answers to environmental justice); Clayton R.

James Willard Hurst identified the attitudes that I lump under "opportu- nity" as the working principle of law in action; that is, "the law not so much as it may appear to philosophers, but more as it had meaning for workaday people and was shaped by them to their wants and vision." Hurst, supra note 123, at 5. It was deemed to be socially desirable, said Hurst, that there be "broad opportunity for the release of creative human energy" by people having "a wide practical range of options or choices as to what they do and how they are affected by circumstances." The law "should protect and promote the release of individual creative energy to the greatest extent compatible with the broad sharing of opportunity for such expression" and "mobilize the resources of the community to help shape an environment which would give men more liberty by increasing the practical range of choices open to them and minimiz- ing the limiting force of circumstances." Id. at 5-6; see also Hall, supra note 108, at 114-15. 228.

Besides, every thing, as it serveth more immedi- ately, or more merely for the food and use of man . . . hath the prece- dent dignity before any other.

"All these treasures of nature, so artfully contrived, so wonderfully propagated, so provi- dentially supported . . . seem intended by the Creator for the sake of man." Carolus Linnaeus, The Oeconomy of Nature (1751), quoted in Donald Worster, Nature's Economy: The Roots of Ecology 36 (1977). See also Oelschlaeger, supra note 157, at 105. Gerald Postema has suggested that if Jeremy Bentham's philosophy had a model, it was probably the writings of Linnaeus. Postema, supra note 216, at 164-65.

Gene R. Nichol, Jr., Justice Scalia, Standing , and Public Law Litigation , 42 Duke LJ. 1141, 1164 (1993). But Scalia's test seems to require a less abstract relationship between human and animal: It is clear that the person who observes or works with a particular animal threatened by a federal decision is facing perceptible harm, since the very subject of his interest will no longer exist. It is even plausi- ble ... to think that a person who observes or works with animals of a particular species in the very area of the world where that species is threatened by a federal decision is facing such harm, since some ani- mals that might have been the subject of his interest will no longer exist, see Japan Whaling Assn. v.

It goes be- yond the limit, however, and into pure speculation and fantasy, to say that anyone who observes or works with an endangered species, anywh- ere in the world, is appreciably harmed by a single project affecting some portion of that species with which he has no more specific con- nection.

In his search for traditional classifications, Scalia has suggested that the Court should choose the narrowest category, a position that has brought him intense criticism from some commentators.

C. Lucas: the Uniqueness of Land, In Lucas , Scalia announced his newly minted idea that land is protected from government regulation to a greater degree than personal property.237 This new rule has puzzled many commenta- tors,238 but Scalia bases his rationale for this distinction on basic Benthamite theoiy: the idea that property is simply established 235.

A student of early Scalia articles would recognize land as one of those "well-defined and fully developed 'existential' categories of legal activity" that are recognized by lawyers and judges, though not always by scholars, as a category of "factually similar precedent" whose "consistency among themselves" is more important than "their reconcilability with the mass of decisions involving the general principle."

The issue in Lucas was whether Lucas, who owned two lots in the Wild Dunes subdivision in a suburb of Charleston, South Carolina, should be permitted to build homes on them, despite the fact that there was some risk that beach erosion might destroy the homes.241 By characterizing the issue as Lucas's right to use his own land, Scalia evoked the traditional American values associat- ed with Jefferson's fee simple empire - homeownership and self- sufficiency - and found that the Constitution protected Lucas.242 Lucas, however, was a professional developer of homes; he was in the business of selling homes to others.243 Had the issue been characterized as one of business regulation - should Lucas be allowed to sell homes on potentially dangerous lots244 - the 239.

However, the state's engineer testified that the examination of aerial photo- graphs showed that all or part of the Lucas lots were underwater at least 50% of the time over the last forty years. Id. at 113. The coastal engineer who worked for the developers of Wild Dunes, testifying as a witness for Lucas, said on cross examination that the Wild Dunes developers had built an arti- ficial revetment and pumped in sand from offshore to "renourish" the beach. He testified that the developers had "applied for revetment permit and built that and also the renourishment program to protect the properties." Id. at 31. Replenishing or "nourishing" beaches, by dredging sand from offshore shoals and pumping it onto the beach, has become common in recent years, but it is controversial. "[BJeach replenishment upsets the natural system, and it is costly and temporaiy, requiring subsequent replenishment projects to remain effective. The Corps of Engineers refers to its beach replenishment projects as 'ongoing,' but 'eternal' would be a better word." William J. Neal et al., Living with the South Carolina shore 42-44 (1984). Responsible developers such as Lucas undoubtedly inform prospective purchasers that the homes they are buying are located on replenished lots, and responsible car dealers undoubtedly inform buyers when they turn back a car's speedometer, but the temptation to mumble during disclosure must exist. 245. As Scalia wrote elsewhere in the Lucas opinion: It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; '[a]s long recognized, some values are ei'joyed under an implied limita- tion and must yield to the police power.'

Recent literature on the continuing value of specific performance as a remedy for breach of contract has usually accepted without significant debate or discussion the traditional rule that specific performance is available if the contract is for the sale of land because land is "unique." See , e.g., William Bishop, The Choice of Remedy for Breach of Contract, 14 J. Legal Stud. 299, 305 (1985). Earlier commentators assumed that the rule was based on English tradition: Land, "because of its power to determine the financial, social and political status of every British subject, was naturally a highly favored subject in the courts of Britain. . . . Land was power and influence and those were things much desired." Robert Bird &amp; William E. Fanning, Specific Performance of Contracts to Convey Real Estate, 23 Ky. L.J. 380, 380-81 (1935). 249. Compare Hödel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 719 (Scalia, J., concurring) with Lucas, 112 S. Ct. at 2899-2900 (discussing Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51 (1979)). Allard and Irving illustrate contrasting theoretical views about the commodification of the property of American Indians, a group for whom the Jeffersonian mystique of land ownership is peculiarly inapplicable because of their traditions of communal property ownership and their exclusion from mainstream public land law. See John H. Leavitt, Hödel v. Irving: The Supreme Court's Emerging Takings Analysis - A Question of How Many Pumpkin Seeds Per Acre, 18 Envtl. L. 597, 606-13 (1988). In Allard the Court upheld a statute</page><page sequence="59">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1497 means it should be made easily available for purchase, assembly, and use through legal rules that draw bright lines around both the boundaries of land and the rights of the owner.250 prohibiting the sale of eagle feathers, which had been designed as a conserva- tion measure to protect eagles, as applied to a sale of an antique Indian head- dress. The Court unanimously held that no compensation was required be- cause, although the owner had lost the right to sell the property, he could exhibit it and charge admission. In Irving , the Court struck down a statute establishing a mechanism under which small fractional interests in land owned by individual Indian tribe members might escheat to the tribe. The Court held that the right to transmit property at death was so basic that the destruction of that right constituted a taking even though there may have been no eco- nomic ii'juiy. See Frank Michelman, Takings , 1987 , 88 Colum. L Rev. 1600, 1623-24 (1988). Ironically, the Court's conceptual severance and enshrinement of land's commodity value reduced the marketability of Indian-owned land because the existing land titles were so fragmented that the timber and ranch- ing interests wishing to use the land had difficulty assembling it, even though the Bureau of Indian Affairs did most of the work. See William H. Gilbert &amp; John L Taylor, Indian Land Questions , 8 Ariz. L. Rev. 102, 115 (1967). Scalia recognized similar problems of the administrability of scattered parcels of Indi- an land in a case in which property rights were not at issue. County of Yakima v. Yakima Indian Nation, 112 S. Ct. 683, 690-92 (1992); see Note, Coun- ty of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Indian Nation: State Taxation as a Means of Diminishing the Tribal Land Base , 42 Amer. U. L Rev. 1213, 1224-25 (1993). But he saw no such basis for supporting a re- striction on land transfers in Irving. In fact, he was so enthusiastic about the Court's philosophical support of each individual Indian's right to commodity his land that he added a brief concurring opinion saying that he thought that the Irving decision "effectively limits Allard to its facts." 481 U.S. at 719. Subse- quently, in Lucas he cited AUard in his attempt to distinguish between land and personal property from the viewpoint of public expectations: because of "the State's traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings" in personal property, an owner of such property "ought to be aware of the possi- bility that new regulation might render his property economically worthless (at least if the property's only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale), see Andrus v. AUard, 444 U.S. 51, 66-67 (1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers)." Lucas , 112 S. Ct. at 2849-900. His Irving opinion, like his opinion in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), evinces a willingness to strongly support the sanctity of philosophical property concepts in land even in situations where the economic impact on the landowner is minimal, as was the case in Nollan.

Reed, 481 U.S. 368, 381 (1987), a case in which the issue was whether an award of damages for personal injuries constituted personal income of the type that would make the recipient ineligible for welfare. Scalia commented that if damages for personal ir'juries did not constitute income, all healthy people might exceed the $1000 limit on personal resources under federal welfare pro- grams because they could sell their body parts for more than $1000. Toby Golick, Justice Scalia, Poverty and the Good Society , 12 Cardozo L Rev. 1817, 1822 (1991). For an example of the conflict inherent in the commodifìcatìon of a "unique" asset, see Kevin H. Dickinson, Mistaken Improvers of Real Estate , 64 N.C. L Rev. 37, 71-72 (1985). 251. In his article, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules , 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989) [hereinafter Scalia, The Rule of Law], Scalia discussed the di- chotomy between the "general rule of law" and the "personal discretion to do justice." When "personal discretion" is used, Scalia states that justice is done one case at a time, taking into account all of the circumstances, and that the judge begins to resemble a finder of fact more than a determiner of law. How- ever, as laws have become more numerous, "we can less and less afford pro- tracted uncertainty regarding what the law may mean. . . . There are times when even a bad rule is better than no rule at all." Id. at 1179. See , e.g., Em- ployment Div. Dep't of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). See Beau James Brock, Comment, Mr. Justice Antonin Scalia : A Re- naissance of Positivism and Predictability in Constitutional Adjudication, 51 La. L Rev. 623 (1991); see also, Kathleen M. Sullivan, Foreword: The Justices of Rules and Standards, 106 Harv. L Rev. 22 (1992) (discussing "rule of law as a law of rules" as opposed to "rule of law as a rule of standards"). In dis- cussing the opinion in Lucas, 112 S. Ct. at 2886, Sullivan suggests that Scalia stopped short of an absolute rule that total destruction of economically produc- tive use constitutes a taking per se, leaving open the possibility that "back- ground principles of state law" might save a restriction, but that he "planted seeds that can be cultivated into more conservative results tomorrow" by dele- gating to the lower federal courts, composed predominantly of Reagan-Bush ap- pointees, the interpretive power to construe background state law principles narrowly so as to limit the force of this exception.

In NoUan he rejected Justice Brennan s doubts about the boundary of coastal land. NoUan, 483 U.S. at 839 n.6. In City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, 499 U.S. 365, 373 (1991), he chose to treat all land use regulations as anticompetitive rather than adopt the more flexible standard urged by the billboard operator. Scalia explains: In deciding, for example, whether a particular commercial agree- ment containing a vertical restraint constitutes a contract in restraint of trade under the Sherman Act, a court may say that under all the cir-</page><page sequence="61">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1499 clear that he believes land to be an asset. Additionally, he favors legal doctrines that make it easy to translate land into money so that it can more easily be traded in the private market.253 He be- lieves such rules are supported by long tradition,254 and he gives cumstances the particular restraint does not unduly inhibit competition and is therefore lawful; or it may say that no vertical restraints unduly inhibit competition, and since this is a vertical restraint it is lawful. The former is essentially a discretion-conferring approach; the latter establish- es a general rule of law. Scalia, The Rule of Law , supra note 251, at 1177 (citation omitted). Similarly, in California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572, 607-08 (1987), he dissented from the holding that the California Coastal Commission's regula- tions might be classified as "environmental" on a case by case basis, preferring to label all of the Commission's powers as "land use" planning that would have been preempted by federal statute for federal lands. In Lucas , Scalia con- tinues his attempt to increase the use of categorical rules. Although the concept is only vaguely defined and is made subject to state nuisance and property law exceptions, Scalia sets out the "deprivation of all economically productive use of land" as a taking per se. Lucas , 112 S. Ct. at 2901. See Fred R. Disheroon, After Lucas: No More Wetland Takings ?, 17 Vt. L. Rev. 683, 684 (1993). 253. In Sovereign Immunity , supra note 234, at 875, Scalia noted that money is adequate compensation when the land is acquired by the government. While sitting on the D.C. Circuit he held that a landowner had no basis to ei'join a taking of his land if monetary relief were available, and that when interests in land have been converted to other assets they no longer partake of the special legal rules applicable to land. Ramirez de Arellano v. Weinberger, 745 F.2d 1500, 1564 (D.C. Cir., 1984) (Scalia, J., dissenting), vacated , 471 U.S. 1113 (1985); Associacion de Reclamantes v. United Mexican States, 735 F.2d 1517, 1523 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert, denied , 470 U.S. 1051 (1985). This may reflect a doctrinal preference for damage remedies over specific relief based on theo- ries of economic efficiency. See Bo wen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 924 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting), discussed in Douglas Laycock, The Death of the Irreparable Injury Rule , 103 Harv. L. Rev. 688, 689 (1990). 254. In Lucas, Scalia found that the tradition of treating regulations as con- ceptual takings was so well established through its acceptance by the Court since 1928 that further inquiry into the historical accuracy of the inteipretation was foreclosed, despite his recognition that the original understanding of the takings clause did not extend to protection against regulation. Lucas , 112 S. Ct. at 2900 n.15. This failure to "dissemble" is somewhat surprising in light of Scalia's 1989 advocacy of originalism: It may surprise the layman, but it will surely not surprise the lawyers here, to learn that originalism is not, and had perhaps never been, the sole method of constitutional exegesis. It would be hard to count on the fingers of both hands and the toes of both feet, yea, even on the hairs of one's youthful head, the opinions that have in fact been rendered not on the basis of what the Constitution originally meant, but on the basis</page><page sequence="62">1500 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 24:1439 tradition great weight.265 of what the judges currently thought it desirable for it to mean. That is, I suppose, the sort of behavior Chief Justice Hughes was referring to when he said the Constitution is what the judges say it is. But in the past, nonoriginalist opinions have almost always had the decency to lie, or at least to dissemble, about what they were doing - either ignoring strong evidence of original intent that contradicted the minimal recited evidence of an original intent congenial to the court's desires, or else not discussing original intent at all, speaking in terms of broad constitu- tional generalities with no pretense of historical support. Antonin Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil , 57 U. CIN. L. Rev. 849, 852 (1989); see also Michael J. Gerhardt, A Tale of Two Textualists: A Critical Comparison of Justices Black and Scalia} 74 B.U. L. Rev. 25, 61-63 (1994). Scalia's recognition of the validity of state nuisance and property law is also carefully limited to traditional, as opposed to novel, interpretations of that law "when used to establish an exception under the takings clause." Lucas , 112 S. Ct. at 2901. That he considers the rules applicable to land to be bound up in tradition is most apparent in the Association opinion, in which he describes the treatment of land under international law with acļjectives such as "prime- val," "instinctive," and "mystical." Associacion de Reclamantes v. United Mexi- can States, 735 F.2d 1517, 1521 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert denied, 470 U.S. 1051 (1985). For a summary of the types of regulation to which land was tradition- ally subjected at the time the Constitution was adopted, see Schultz, supra note 109, at 487-90. 255. To Scalia, if a rule or custom can be traced back far enough the need for further justification of it disappears. For example, in Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 781 (1991), he held that the Court's long es- tablished interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment was a sufficient justifica- tion for dishonoring the explicit promise of President Washington to the Indi- ans that they could have access to the federal courts for claims against the states regarding their lands. Scalia expresses such a strong reverence for "tradition" that he elevates it to a status equal with the Constitution itself, and superior to the founders' original intent: "[T]he text of the Constitution and our traditions say what they say and there is no fiddling with them," and we should rely "upon text and traditional pmctice to determine the law." Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2883-84 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). See also Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 571 (1991); Rutan v. Republi- can Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62, 93 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012, 1017 (1988); Schad v. Arizona, 111 S. Ct. 2491, 2507 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring) ("It is precisely the historical practices that define what is 'due' [process].").

Incidental or Reciprocal Government Regulation Scalia's opinions do not reflect a libertarian viewpoint.256 Some of his former academic colleagues have criticized his failure to support the libertarian position,257 in particular his failure to afford property other than land the same degree of protection to which land is entitled.258 Even in regard to land, Scalia supports a greater degree of governmental regulation than libertarian theo- original intent, he often sides with tradition. See Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U.S. 232, 259 (1987) (Scalia, J., dis- senting in part). See also Lucas , 112 S. Ct. at 2900 n.15.

The most notable exponent of a truly libertarian land ethic was James Watt, who headed the Mountain States Legal Foundation before becoming Secretary of the Interior under President Reagan.

Rev. 473, 549 (1990). The intellectual stimulation for the libertarian land ethic comes from Richard Epstein, a law professor from the University of Chicago who has pro- pounded a theory in support of minimal government intervention in regard to land. See , e.g., Richard Epstein, The Utilitarian Foundations of Natural Law , 12 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 713 (1989); Richard Epstein, Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain (1985).

Under the "incidental effect" test,260 a generally applicable law is valid if it is not specifically directed at a constitutionally protected interest, and it has only an incidental effect on that interest. Scalia has expressed this view in regard to such varied issues as religion, speech, abortion and land.261 As he uses the test in practice, he apparently defines "incidental effect" as "an effect incidental to the purpose " of the law, since he has used the test to uphold laws that caused people to lose their jobs, an effect 259. Bentham also supported land law reform within the framework of ex- isting expectations. POSTEMA, supra note 216, at 190. It should be noted, of course, that many of Justice Scalia's opinions represent the views of a narrow majority of the court, and thus may have required compromises to obtain a consensus. Even his dissents, however, do not appear to represent extreme lib- ertarian positions. See California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572 (1987); Pennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1, 20 (1988). 260. The "incidental effect" test has become a Scalia specialty ever since he used it in the famous peyote decision. Employment Div.

Califor- nia Coastal Commission decision contains emphatic recognition that regulations may and should address cumulative impact in order to spread the cost reciprocally among all of the landowners causing the problem.266 He even suggests that the failure to con- 262.

Smith , supra, is a law that destroys the value of land without being aimed at land. Perhaps such a law - the generally applicable criminal prohibition on the manufacturing of alcoholic beverages challenged in Mugler comes to mind - cannot constitute a compensable taking. See 123 U.S., at 655-656, 8 S. Ct., at 293-294. But a regulation specifically directed to land use no more acquires immunity by plundering landowners generally than does a law specifically directed at religious practice acquire immunity by prohib- iting all religions. Justice STEVENS' approach renders the Takings Clause little more than a particularized restatement of the Equal Protection Clause. Lucas , 112 S. Ct at 2899 n.14. 264. See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922); see also , Sullivan, supra note 251, at 90.

Cf. William N. Eskridge, Jr., The New Textualism , 37 UCLA L Rev. 621, 642-43, 650-56 (1990) (analysis of Scalia's use of public choice theory in statutory inteipretation). Scalia has a low opinion of government land use planning. After examining the California Coastal Commission's program he was convinced that land use management "is afoot," a phrase that any Sherlockian would immediately identify with the search for crime. California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock, 480 U.S. 572, 610 (1987). If "leveraging of the police power" were to be allowed, it would be likely to "produce stringent land-use regulation which the State then waives to accomplish other purposes." NoUan , 483 U.S. at 837 n.5. Scalia labeled this practice "extortion." Id. at 837. He emphasized that the exaction of real estate from a developer was particularly suspect because of the "heightened risk that the purpose is avoidance of the compensation requirement, rather than the stated police-power objective." Id. at 841. Scalia reiterates this point explicitly in Lucas , where he seems to assume that state court judges' interpretation of the common law represents the tradition to which we should adhere rather than the pattern of legislative practice. Lucas , 112 S. Ct. at 2894-95. Yet Scalia again has been careful to distance himself from the libertarian viewpoint Scalia, Morality , supra note 228, at 124. When his colleagues attempt to distin- guish zoning from economic regulation, he argues that the very purpose of zoning is to "displace unfettered business freedom." City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, 499 U.S. 365, 372 (1991). Apparently zoning is a legitimate function if used to internalize externalities, but when other motivations intrude the Constitution is violated. See Hovenkamp, supra note 119, at 44246. Thus in his dissent in Pennell Scalia said that the takings clause should be used to invalidate any attempt to hide redistributive motives in the form of off-budget subsidies. He distinguished zoning, the validity of which is based on the fact that "the restricted use is the source of the social problem." Pennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1, 22 (1988). But see Fisher, supra note 238, at 1395-96 (Scalia opinions in Lucas and Pennell are hard to reconcile). However, if a redistribution program were based on long tradition, would it offend the Constitution? Compare Scalia, Morality , supra note 228, at 125-26, with Rose, supra note 122, at 79-80, 95 (local land use regulators are guardians of a Pocockian "ancient constitution" of unwritten community understandings). Scalia sees traditional zoning, on the other hand, as a method by which externalities are internalized. It meets his test because the proposed use is the cause of the effect sought to be remedied by the regulation. Pennell , 485 U.S. at 20. In his opinion for the Court in Columbia , which exempts zoning from antitrust review, he conceded that zoning adversely affects new market entrants but he had no doubt about the validity of such a purpose. Columbia , 499 U.S. at 372-76. (Admittedly no issue of zoning's constitutionality was before the Court, but his glowing defense of zoning would surely have been more circum- spect if he had doubts about the issue.) He has written elsewhere that "[t]o say that distributive justice is a purely moral matter is not to say that govern- ment cannot undertake the function." Scalia, Moralityt supra note 228, at 126.</page><page sequence="67">1994] FOUR LAND ETHICS 1505 might make a regulation unconstitutional.207 Scalia is a firm be- liever in private market mechanisms but he also supports regula- tion of land use for a wide variety of purposes268 so long as the regulation of land is incidental to a valid public purpose or pro- vides a reciprocity of advantage.268 In summary, Justice Scalia strongly supports the opportunity of landowners to maximize their wealth through ownership of land.270 He prefers crisp legal rules that minimize the need for balancing vague standards, and supports a rule treating land as unique and enhancing land's status as a commodity.271 He rec- 267. Nollan , 483 U.S. at 835 n.4, 837 n.5. Scalia's endorsement of common law nuisance may reflect an assumption that judges, unlike legislators, will use some "felicific calculus" to weigh impartially the impact of an activity on all affected persons. See Humbach, supra note 238, at 14. For a utilitarian inter- pretation of common law nuisance, see Robert Ellickson, Alternatives to Zon- ing: Covenants , Nuisance Rules and Fines as Land Use Controls , 40 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1 (1973). 268. See, e.g., Nollan, 483 U.S. at 834-36. Scalia recognizes that the list of purposes will be increasing with new scientific knowledge. Lucas , 112 S. Ct. at 2899-2900. However, Scalia's respect for tradition seems to exceed his respect for modern science. Where land is involved, legislative claims of scientific mo- tivation are treated by Justice Scalia with extreme skepticism. Id. at 2898 n.ll. The South Carolina legislature's concern about erosion was dismissed in Lucas as staff-constructed puffing not even worthy of consideration. Id. And the con- cerns about biodiversity expressed in Defenders of Wildlife were treated as if they were simply aesthetic preferences. Liyan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2137 (1992). 269. Scalia examines regulators' motives closely because he believes that "rent-seeking" by government officials is a prevalent and troublesome social problem. See Gregory S. Alexander, Takings , Narratives , and Power , 88 Colum. L Rev. 1752, 1764 (1988) (discussing Nollan ); cf. Stevens v. City of Cannon Beach, 114 S. Ct. 1332, 1335 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certio- rari). For a critique of this position, see Margaret Jane Radin, Evaluating Gov- ernment Reasons for Changing Property Regimes, 55 Alb. L. Rev. 597, 602 (1992); Frank I. Michelman, Diswetionary Interests - Takings , Motives , and Un- constitutional Conditions: Commentary on Radin and Sullivan , 55 Alb. L Rev. 619, 625 (1992). Professor Michelman says Mwe have to imagine Justice Scalia as having a special theory or animating vision that tells him to presume lawmaker perversity and bad faith when the issue is property rules (and conse- quently distribution), but to presume lawmaker reliability and good faith when the issues are personal autonomy and public morals."

Land Ethics In Action The four land ethics discussed above play important roles in the United States today. This section briefly describes these roles. A. Order Arthurian land policies designed to protect the social order continue to play an important role in the United States. Although class distinction in the United States never attained the rigidity of the English model, land policy in the United States has frequently been used to stabilize existing social relationships. For example, federal tax policy creates a sharp distinction between homeowners, who receive interest deductions, and ten- ants, who do not.273 A new nationally supported system of mort- gage commodification has increased the extent to which "home- owners" now hold in an almost tenurial relationship to the pen- sion funds and similar institutions that dominate long-term invest- ment.274 An Arthurian network of deed restrictions and local zon- ing protects many residential communities from disruptions in the social order.275 Gated communities increasingly resemble forti- 272.

Reform Ricardian demands for reform are less shrill in the United States than in many other countries because the privileges at- tached to land ownership have never been as dramatic as those that prompted Ricardo's call for reform. Nevertheless, substantial privileges exist and have prompted demands for greater equity.277 Reformers object that agricultural interests destroy the soil resource and pollute the environment while receiving cash subsi- dies, property tax abatements, and relief from responsibility for damages caused by pesticides.278 They question whether mining interests should continue to use the federal lands without making reimbursement to taxpayers.279 One noted law and economics scholar has characterized urban redevelopment cartels as "feu- dal."280 supra note 256, at 756-57; Rose, supra note 122, at 95. 276.

Responsibility Modern Muirians have substituted wetlands for Muiťs Sierran peaks as the resource most in need of preservation.281 Moreover, the protection of wilderness has become well-accepted policy in Congress,282 and a growing recognition of the importance of biodiversity has placed emphasis on the need for preservation of a wide range of habitats. Perhaps the most dramatic recent success of the ethic of responsibility is the legislation imposing responsi- bility on those who have poisoned the land through careless use of toxic chemicals.283 The costs involved in these responsibilities have been so excessive in relation to the damage involved that they have prompted new calls for reform.284 If John Muir were to return he would not lack causes for which to fight. Although those who attempt to model their activities on Muiťs are but a small fraction of the population,285 Muiťs influ- ence goes far beyond those who follow directly in his footsteps. Many Americans honor his example intermittently or vicariously. For example, the Outward Bound movement has brought thou- sands of business executives into the wilderness as an educational 281. See , e.g., National Wetlands Policy Forum, Protecting America's Wetlands: An Action Agenda (1988). One wonders how Muir would have reacted to this twist of geomorphology.

Opportunity If utilitarians had worried that the entrepreneurial opportuni- ty to create wealth out of land would be stifled by rigid controls, by the ability of privileged vested interests to avoid reform, and by the demands of preservationists for greater responsibility, the free- wheeling business climate of the 1980s proved their worries groundless. Legislation converted many savings and loan associa- tions into governmentally insured entrepreneurial vehicles for the development of real estate that were often operated by developers with little regard for market needs.288 The result was a taxpayer bailout of unprecedented proportions289 and a record oversupply of commercial buildings, which may dampen new construction well into the twenty-first century.290 Meanwhile, in residential real estate, Ricardo's idea that eco- nomic rent was the windfall of the gentry was transformed into the government-subsidized homeownership movement - if you can't beat the gentry, join the gentry!291 Economists might classi- fy land as just another asset, but the American public thought otherwise.292 286.

Conclusion Each of the land ethics discussed in this article represents an important factor in the way Americans currently think about land: Malory's ethic of order, Ricardo's ethic of reform, Muiťs ethic of responsibility, and Scalia's ethic of opportunity. Each will be an element of any public decisionmaking process having a major impact on land. The search for a new land ethic will continue, but home construction. Glenn H. Beyer, Housing and Society 360-61 (1965). The depression beginning in 1929 and the war that followed virtually halted housing construction until after 1945, but from the 1960 through the 1980s, American consumers and the financial institutions that backed them became infected with the Ricardian vice: they believed that the price of land could go in no direction except up. During the 1980s, financial institutions would often loan money on real estate regardless of the credit status of the borrower. The pres- ident of one savings and loan association is reported to have said "if the own- er has a pulse, we'll give him a loan."
