<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND THE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE GERALD BIRNEY SMITH The University of Chicago Recently in Germany the radical critics in the realm of New Testament scholarship have felt themselves compelled to become defenders of the faith. The methods of historical criticism which they had been using with the avowed purpose of penetrating back of myth, legend, and theological misinterpretation so as to discover the character of the "historical Jesus" were apparently taken out of their hands by a few bold spirits who asserted that the logical outcome of the critical method was to eliminate Jesus altogether from the story of the growth of our religion. There may, indeed, it was asserted, have been a man bearing the name of Jesus. But even if this be true, he is simply the accidental figure around which clustered myths and legends and cult-forms taken from oriental religions and from the Jewish and Hellenistic speculations of the time. So ran the argument of the new radicals. The Christian scholars who up to this time had posed as pioneers were now made to seem too timid, too much bound by ecclesiastical interests to dare to draw the legitimate conclusions from their own premises and methods. The battle has thus been raging fiercely over what seems to an American mind an absurd question, viz., "Did any such man as the Jesus of the gospels ever live at all ?" In this controversy, the radical scholars in the German uni- versities have been compelled to take what is, comparatively speaking, a somewhat conservative position. They have insisted that critical scholarship is far from any such conclusions as those attributed to it. Professor Weinel has contributed to a leading theological journal two articles which ask the question whether criticism has made impossible the preaching of the gospel.' In these articles he shows clearly the unscientific nature of a criticism S"1Ist unsere Verkiindigung von Jesus unhaltbar geworden?" Zeitschrift fiir Theologie und Kirche (1910o), Hefte I and 2, January and March. 368</page><page sequence="2">BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND THE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE 369 which comes to such utterly negative results concerning the char- acter of Jesus; and he expresses the firm conviction that the critical method, when properly used, will establish beyond question such facts concerning Jesus that faith may confidently build on them. The warmth with which Weinel defends the possibility of a vigorous faith in Jesus in conjunction with critical scholar- ship is evidence that he, at least, possesses such faith, and earnestly desires that criticism shall make its positive contribution to religious belief. In England a controversy of a somewhat different nature has been acfively prosecuted under the lead of the Hibbert Journal. The issue which has been here thrust before us is the question whether, in view of the results of critical scholarship, we have the right to call Jesus divine in any real sense. Jesus or Christ ? is the title of a volume of essays by various authors dealing with this problem. Other evidences of the intense interest in the question are the unusually strong volumes on the subject of Christology which have appeared from Scottish and English scholars in the past two years." The question thus brought before the English-speaking world is sufficiently important, if less startling than that which has engaged the attention of the Germans. These two controversies are symptomatic of a situation which causes perplexity and hesitation to every pastor who has kept himself informed of the course of scholarship and who desires to preach what is true rather than what is emotionally acceptable to his hearers. Just what can one sincerely say about Jesus in the Christmas sermon? The anthems on that day will ring with the triumphant announcement of the miraculous birth. The Scripture readings will set forth the joy of angels and the adoration of the Magi in the presence of the heaven-sent babe. But the critics have made us feel uncertain as to the historicity of the infancy narratives. Many intelligent people in our churches know that these wonderfully beautiful stories about the marvelous child are by many scholars regarded as legends which grew up as a result of later theological views concerning Jesus. They will perhaps be 2 Notably, Denney, Jesus and the Gospel (90o8); Forsyth, The Person and Place of Christ (90o9); and Sanday, Christologies, Ancient and Modern (910o).</page><page sequence="3">370 THE BIBLICAL WORLD watching for evidences of insincerity on the part of the preacher; while anxious conservative souls will also be watching and hoping to be spared the paralyzing consequences of negative criticism on this day when faith wishes to rejoice in the coming of Immanuel. What, then, shall the preacher do? Professor Sanday, in his discussion, has suggested two types of Christology which may be constructed with a full recognition of the results of critical scholarship. He calls them the "full" and the "reduced " types respectively.3 Both types would probably in large measure agree as to the facts established by historical criticism. Both would hold that we have no absolutely conclusive evidence in favor of many of the details which orthodox theology has affirmed. But they differ in their treatment of the material which is thus left doubtful by criticism. The difference is not unlike that between "loose constructionists" and "strict constructionists" in the matter of interpreting the constitution of the United States. In cases of doubt shall the government assume the right to act ? Or shall it restrict itself to those rights which are explicitly stated in the constitution? The "full" Christology, according to Dr. Sanday, employs critical conclusions merely to furnish the founda- tion upon which religious thinking may build the amplest possible structure in which faith may find its home. The "reduced" Christology, on the other hand, insists that we must content our- selves with the sure foundations. The desire to be absolutely honest with the facts means in this latter case a more or less clearly recognized agnosticism. Dr. Sanday confesses himself a hearty advocate of the "full" type of Christology. The way in which he fills the outline is inter- esting enough to deserve more attention than can be given to it here. He feels that in the recent psychological investigations of the powers of man we have solid grounds for holding that through the subliminal consciousness every man may reach into a region of existence which is inaccessible to his more prosaic and specialized ordinary consciousness. Readers of the late Professor James's Varieties of Religious Experience will recall a similar suggestion that in the subconscious regions of our experience we have direct 3 See Christologies, Ancient and Modern, Lectures iv and v.</page><page sequence="4">BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND THE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE 371 contact with the divine. Professor Sanday holds that in Jesus this somewhat mysterious realm of psychic life was so much more highly developed than in the case of other men that in him we have a unique divine presence manifesting itself in and through all his life. The theory is not altogether unlike Dorner's doctrine of the progressive incarnation of God in Jesus; but it appeals to scientific psychology rather than to metaphysics. Suggestive as is this procedure, it simply transfers the issue from the realm of historical criticism into that of psychological criticism. There is by no means a unanimity of opinion among psychologists as to the validity of this appeal to the subconscious. It therefore does not establish a Christology which is beyond the reach of criticism. It indicates, however, Dr. Sanday's feeling that New Testament criticism cannot and does not say the last word in the matter. A Christology implies some sort of philosophizing con- cerning the significance of Jesus; and philosophy must submit to critical tests of its own. Dr. Sanday's book, like those of Denney and Forsyth, frankly recognizes that the time has come when religious beliefs, like beliefs in the realm of medicine, politics, or philosophy, must be expounded in a world which is in the habit of applying critical tests. There is no possibility of isolating our theology from the rest of our life. Whatever we affirm to be true in religion must be shown to be true by exactly the same means that we should employ to convince men of the truth in other realms. In the Christology which Dr. Sanday proposes, he does not attempt to establish a mystery by a simple appeal to the authority of biblical texts. He rightly feels that if anything like the biblical doctrine of the divine nature of Christ is to be established it must be made to appear possible and reasonable to thinking men. It must be brought so definitely into relation with our experience that we may be able to see how such a Christ opens to us the way to God. It is comparatively easy for one who follows Dr. Sanday's arguments to see the practical consequences of such a relation of Jesus to God as is suggested by his doctrine. The presence of God in human life is made perfectly evident and Dr. Sanday could preach a Christmas sermon with power and effectiveness although he is one of the most noted biblical critics in the world.</page><page sequence="5">372 THE BIBLICAL WORLD What makes it possible for him to feel that he has a positive Christmas message ? It is interesting to notice that the content of his Christology is put into language which would have been unin- telligible to the writers of the New Testament. To be sure mysti- cism to a certain extent understands mysticism the world over. But the Christology of the New Testament does not appeal to any "subliminal consciousness" in order to explain or sustain the divinity of Jesus. It employs quite other terms-terms as strange to us as would be the phrases of Professor James to them. In content this proposed Christology for the twentieth century is very different from that of the first century. Yet it is impossible to escape the conviction that in spirit Dr. Sanday is in profound sympathy with the beliefs which expressed themselves in the infancy narratives. The vitality of his message consists in the fact that he is striving to give expression to a faith of his own so real and so interwoven with experience that he cannot rest until he has put it into a form suited to carry a genuine appeal to men of today. The process by which he reaches this end is somewhat as fol- lows. By critical study, and by his own religious reflection on the New Testament records, he is convinced that Jesus brought to mankind the supreme revelation of God. He perceives the splendid power which has come to the church through holding and pro- claiming the doctrine of the divinity of Christ. He longs to have a share in this great tradition. And he proceeds to suggest the way in which it seems to him probable that Jesus possessed the capacity which he had and which he still has to bring men to a realization of the saving power of God. It is evident that the messianic concepts of the early Christians do not seem to him to furnish an interpretation which would now be helpful. We are not doing our thinking today in terms of messianism. Neither does he attempt to persuade us to accept that doctrine of con- substantiality of nature which found its way into the authorized creeds of the church. We are not doing our thinking in terms of Greek metaphysics. Dr. Sanday frankly employs a line of thought which is likely to appeal to those who are conversant with the religious life and philosophy of our day. Nevertheless this modern apparatus is so used that the reader feels an essential historical</page><page sequence="6">BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND THE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE 373 continuity between the proposed Christology of the modern scholar and the doctrines concerning Christ which have commanded the loyalty of Christians in the past. The outcome of biblical criticism is often represented in such a way that it is inevitably made to appear more or less "destructive" in character. The mood of investigation is very different from the mood of enthusiastic affirmation. The asking of questions con- cerning the teachings of the New Testament seems to the en- thusiast a sign of a lukewarm faith or of a latent skepticism. Men who are impressed by this necessary-but be it said preliminary- aspect of criticism are accustomed to measure the affirmations of critical scholarship by the standard of New Testament affirmation, and to detect the more hesitating tone in the judicial statements of investigators, even when these are most conservative in their conclusions. If criticism calls in question any aspects of the biblical faith, its outcome is immediately judged to be "negative." If the critic is at all radical in his conclusions, he is called "destruc- tive"; and the sweeping conclusion is reached that critical methods are inherently dangerous to vital faith. But the raising of doubts is only one element in the critical process. It is necessary to remember the positive as well as the negative side of criticism. No scholar takes any permanent delight in putting question marks in the place of positive asser- tions. Problems are raised only to arrive at more tenable con- victions. The fact that the untrained layman cannot follow the intricacies of the process by which these firmer convictions are reached should not be an argument against the critical ideal. In no realm can the specialist expect everybody to understand all that he does. If, however, positive results can be shown to have come from the specialized researches of the expert, men welcome a con- tinuation of his experiments. In so far as there is popular oppo- sition to the employment of critical methods in the realm of biblical study, it must be because men are not convinced of the positive achievements of this branch ot science. This failure to secure a popular welcome is recognized by Pro- fessor Weinel when he confesses that the religionsgeschichtliche Volksbiicher, which were planned with the intention of helping</page><page sequence="7">374 THE BIBLICAL WORLD men better to understand the nature of the Bible, have actually been a source of perplexity to many minds. The source of this perplexity is not far to seek. For centuries the world has been accustomed to measure the validity of any conclusion in theology by asking whether it conforms to the doctrine contained in the Bible. To a large extent this conformity has been quantitative in character. Any system of belief which omits biblical details has been regarded as in so far defective; and it has been assumed that the traditional interpretation of biblical doctrine is a faithful reproduction of the contents of the Bible. If critical study reveals the fact that a current interpretation is not justified by a better knowledge of the facts, the first impulse of the puzzled soul is to object to this subtraction from the content of his faith. Just what can we believe when the critics are questioning so many things ? Now, the positive achievement of biblical criticism is the emancipation of men from this quantitative habit of measuring religious affirmations. No mere catalogue of facts or of arguments could ever produce a religion. The vitality of faith is not to be estimated by asking concerning the quantity of its affirmations. As a matter of fact, as Harnack has pointed out, the most signifi- cant enlargements of religious life have come from a reduction in the quantitative aspect of religion. When Jesus disregarded the minutiae of Pharisaic observance, and when Luther swept away Catholic scholasticism, real religion found its scope magnified by this reduction in quantity. In like manner it is conceivable that a "reduced" Christology might, if the omissions were of the right sort, be all the stronger for the reduction. It might gain intensively because of extensive loss. When, therefore, it is discovered that criticism has compelled doubt or even negation in respect to some of the details of his- torical Christology, it is necessary to ask the further question whether this curtailment may not actually be a gain. Does not it open the way for such a straightforward modern exposition as that which Dr. Sanday suggests ? Does it not set personal faith free to construct on the basis of the data yielded by criticism a form of theology which shall more nearly represent the vital</page><page sequence="8">BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND THE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE 375 interests of faith than would be possible if one felt externally compelled to try to affirm all the elements of New Testament doctrine ? But criticism yields more than a permissive freedom in the construction of theology. It furnishes a positive appreciation of those forms of faith which it recognizes to have embodied transi- tory elements. While seeing clearly that the apocalyptic expecta- tions of the primitive disciples cannot be held by modern theo- logians, the historical student who proceeds with genuine insight is likely to come to the conclusion that if he had lived in Palestine during the early part of the first century, he too would have expressed his faith in terms of that apocalyptic enthusiasm. He then values the messianism of the New Testament primarily because of its religious vitality, and is able to expound with positive sympathy the aspirations and the achievements of this triumphant faith. What better continuity with the apostolic age could be found than this ability which criticism has furnished to appreciate positively and accurately the faith of the apostles, different though that faith is in form from the beliefs of later ages ? Moreover, criticism has revealed to us the presence of differing forms of belief in the New Testament itself. From men with diverse habits of thought came differing estimates of Jesus; and the result is a wonderful catholicity and richness of theology. Each New Testament writer has integrated the Christ of his faith into the world-view which he held. If he were a simple Jewish Christian, he could be content with the anthropomorphic apocalyp- ticism of the early chapters of Acts. If he had felt the power of the more abstract and scientific world-view of Greek thought, he would be compelled to assign to Christ a wider cosmic significance. The important fact which lies behind this variety is the power of the name of Christ to inspire the various theologies of the New Testa- ment. This very adaptability of Christian faith is an earnest of its sure victory over all more rigid types of religion. It is a legiti- mate step from this recognition of the freedom and naturalness of New Testament faith to the exercise of the same freedom and naturalness in the formulation of a modern Christology. When it is seen that the writings to which we go for our knowledge of Jesus</page><page sequence="9">376 THE BIBLICAL WORLD were not produced by processes of technical criticism, it ought to take from us the fear lest such criticism may subtract from the glory of the great confessions of faith formulated in the early church. We should rather rejoice that so plain a warrant is given to all followers of Jesus to formulate their faith in him in that vital and direct way which is characteristic of the New Testa- ment, knowing that it is as true now as in the days of Paul that the letter killeth, while the spirit maketh alive. Paradoxical as it sounds, criticism makes it certain that no man builds up his religious convictions by a critical process of discover- ing bare "facts " from which he may draw conclusions. We inevi- tably share the social ideals of our time, and from these construct our world of religious thought. It is doubtful whether, even if the incontrovertible "facts" concerning Jesus were to be critically established, they would be as valuable for the nourishment of the religious life as are the confessions of faith which we have before us in the writings of the New Testament. The Jesus in whom the disciples believed was the marvelous figure with characteristics corresponding to the socialized ideas of messianic activity which conditioned the thinking of the early Christians. They did not proceed to ask critically whether the application of messianic categories to Jesus was justified. They simply interpreted their abounding faith in him in terms which entered into their daily conversation and thought. The power of their Christology con- sists in the fact that they interpreted their faith directly in terms of ideas already potent in social life. When Dr. Sanday abandons any scholastic attempt to reproduce literally the details of New Testament doctrine, and essays to express his faith in terms of ideas which are gaining currency today, he is really true to the spirit of New Testament Christology, however divergent his theories may be in form from those of the apostles. It is for this reason that he has a positive message. Other theologians of today will doubtless prefer to use other means of expressing their faith. We may expect to find in our age divergence of doctrine as truly as it was found in the first century. But there may be the same spirit of loyalty and love to Jesus underlying all; and whenever a Christian's devotion and trust is sincerely expressed in terms which</page><page sequence="10">BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND THE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE 377 have a real meaning to men of today, we shall have a vital proclama- tion of the gospel. The purpose of the Christmas sermon is so to set forth the sig- nificance of Jesus as to bring into the world in which the preacher and his hearers live a sense of joy and triumph so genuine and vital that in voicing it men shall feel a rightful share in the splendid optimism of the infancy narratives. It is the spirit of the New Testament which we wish to preserve. If we find ourselves com- pelled to engage in the attempt to persuade ourselves to "accept" this or that detail of the primitive picture of Christ, we may be very certain that we are engaged in an academic task. We have lost contact with the power of Jesus, and have begun to try to live by the outcome of apologetic reasonings. It ought to be the serv- ice of criticism to free us from some of the burdens which attach to an uncritical view of the New Testament. When we recognize that the writings which had enough vitality to survive from the first century are not mere prosaic records of fact, but are primarily expressions of living Christian conviction; when we see that the events which were narrated and the arguments which were wrought out have been preserved just because they were tributary to a vital faith; when we note the presence within the New Testament of differing Christologies, ought we not to be emancipated from bondage to the literalness of mere technical scrutiny and inspired by the greatness of religious trust and aspiration which criticism has helped us to appreciate? If this be true, the preacher who has studied the New Testament by critical methods will attempt to do in his preaching just what the preachers of the first century did. He will attempt to por- tray Jesus in such vital relations to the world in which his hearers live, that they will rejoice at the salvation which comes through Christ. Dr. Sanday himself illustrates this ideal in his book. As has been intimated, his Christology is so unlike that of the New Testament in form that it preserves few external coincidences. One may, it is true, be quite dubious about the legitimacy of his appeal to the occult realms of mental experience. But one cannot escape the sense of a deep and vital faith which leads the Oxford professor to long to make persuasive a belief in Christ which actually</page><page sequence="11">378 THE BIBLICAL WORLD enriches and strengthens his own life. Different as is his Chris- tology from that of the New Testament, he has stated it without employing "destructive" criticism. To convict Peter and Paul and the synoptists of superstition and of false world-views would be an achievement of meager value. This is not the end and aim of criticism. Criticism has done its work only when it enables us to see how and why these and other noble men came to their convictions, and when it evokes from us the warm appreciation of the essentially positive contribution made by men who in their theology could introduce Jesus with saving power into the world in which they lived. A genuinely critical appreciation of the early Christologies will call forth a desire to be of some similar service to the world in which we live. The main problem then will not be whether we can literally reproduce the New Testament doctrine as our own. The primary question is whether we have any such personal love for Jesus and trust in him that we can give to him a supreme place in our world where he shall control the issues of life. If we can, and if we yearn to bring into the experience of other men a transforming power which we ourselves have received from our knowledge of Jesus, we shall come to the Christmas season with a song of joy in the heart which will easily find expression alongside the poetry of the infancy narra- tives and the triumphant music of the anthems. Criticism rightly used will free us from the artificial task of attempting to carry over a first-century world-view into the twentieth century. It will set us free to preach a "full" Christology, not because of the number of biblical assertions which we make, but because of a biblical desire to show the marvelous consequences of the coming of Jesus into the world of our own thought and experience. Not to destroy but to fulfil is the purpose which Christ begets in men, even when they employ critical methods of study.</page></plain_text>
