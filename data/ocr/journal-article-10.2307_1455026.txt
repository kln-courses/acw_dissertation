According to Maimonides, lifnim mi-shurat ha-din characterizes the behavior of the hasid who adopts extreme character traits which deviate from the Aristotelian mean-in particular, extreme humility, or meekness, and the capacity to quell anger, or impas- sivity. How Maimonides arrived at this conception of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is a puzzle. He has taken what is essentially a legal principle and converted it into a philosophical and ethical one. Maimonides provides no information as to how he came up with his interpretation, nor have medieval or modern commentators been able to shed much light on this issue. I attempt to show how Maimonides formulated his concept of lifnim mi- shurat ha-din by reading rabbinic sources through the lens of Aristotelian ethics. Particularly important to Maimonides were the halakhic discus- sions of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in the Talmud, which Maimonides seems to have read as requiring people of superior social-standing to act with hu- mility when interacting with others of lower standing. Also important was an aggadic source which connects the restraint of God's anger against the Jewish people with lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. His reading of these Jewish sources was refined by philosophical considerations. In Aristotle, meekness and impassivity are related and mutually reinforcing virtues. Moreover, 1I would like to thank the following individuals who provided insightful com- ments on this paper while it was taking shape: David Novak, Lawrence Kaplan, Daniel H. Frank, and Barry Freundel. Howard Kreisel disagreed with some of the ba- sic premises of this paper, but nonetheless provided valuable insights as well. This paper is dedicated to the memory of my mentor, Marvin Fox. Over the course of his career, Marvin Fox contributed a great deal to the study of Maimonides in gen- eral and to Maimonidean ethics in particular. My own insights here owe a great deal to his scholarship, as well as to his careful method of reading medieval texts. More- over, Marvin Fox was himself a great ethical teacher. He approached his students with care, kindness, and devotion. He was well known for his honesty and decency in dealings with friends and colleagues. For myself and others he was a role model not only as an academic but as one who exemplified the very ethical teachings which he studied and taught.</page><page sequence="2">292 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW each of these virtues serves a role in imitating God, a key concept in Maimondies' ethics. Impassivity accomplishes this purpose because God is a passionless Being capable offeeling anger. Meekness prepares one to im- itate God by taking the focus away from one's own needs and enabling one to behave with impassivity, especially when experiencing insult. A concept that has been the subject of much scholarly speculation in recent years is lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, a phrase which appears in a handful of rabbinic and medieval halakhic sources referring to ac- tions performed "beyond the line of the law." It is fiercely debated whether or not this principle represents an ethic outside halakhah. Scholars of a liberal bent have seized on lifnim mi-shurat ha-din as a concept that suggests that the rabbis did indeed recognize a cate- gory of ethics not mandated by divine directive. As such it reflects the belief that all people have a natural moral conscience and that morality is not reducible to halakhah alone. More traditional scholars have rebutted such arguments with the claim that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is itself a directive within the halakhic system and therefore in no sense an extra-legal norm.2 It is not the purpose of this paper to take a position on this ques- tion. My goal is to focus on how lifnim mi-shurat ha-din was inter- preted by one Jewish thinker in particular: Maimonides, the greatest medieval Jewish philosopher and scholar of halakhah. In his Eight Chapters and Laws of Character Traits in the Mishneh Torah, Mai- monides gives an intriguing definition of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. In both works he lays out an ethics which dictates that the most desirable way of life is the cultivation of character traits according to the Aristotelian mean. He also recognizes an alternative category, the hasid, who adopts extreme character traits which deviate from the mean. Maimonides identifies this latter form of behavior with 2 Among the more recent studies on lifnim mi-shurat ha-din are the following: Aharon Lichtenstein, "Does Jewish Tradition Recognize an Ethic Independent of Halakha?" in Modern Jewish Ethics, ed.

For Maimonides has taken what is essentially a legal princi- ple and converted it into a philosophical one. A concept that in rab- binic sources is seen as describing specific kinds of actions is taken by Maimonides to refer to a certain type of ethical disposition. His discussions in Eight Chapters and Laws of Character Traits do not explain how he came up with this interpretation, nor have medieval or modern commentators shed much light on this issue. In the following pages, I will attempt to show that Maimonides formulated his understanding of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din from a careful and original reading of rabbinic sources. He did not simply wrench the phrase from its context and assign it his own philosoph- ical meaning. Rather, his notion of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din reflects an insightful interpretation of how the early rabbis understood this concept, which he then filtered through his Aristotelian approach toward ethics.3 My analysis will focus almost exclusively on the presentation in the Mishneh Torah. While Maimonides also deals with lifnim mi- shurat ha-din in his earlier work, Eight Chapters, I am of the opin- ion-as are many others-that there are substantial differences between the two; these differences are great enough that the two pre- sentations warrant separate treatment. I have chosen to focus on the discussion in the Mishneh Torah which was written later and is therefore more mature than that which appears in Eight Chapters.4 It is, I believe, also the more developed account. 3My discussion will not focus on the related concept of the hasid in Maimonides' thinking except as it relates to the issue of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. This approach raises some legitimate objections, for one could argue that the two are so closely linked in Maimonides' thought that the treatment of the one must include the other; moreover, there is good reason to claim that of the two concepts, the hasid is far more important than lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in Maimonidean ethics, since, in the programmatic discus- sions in Eight Chapters and Laws of Character Traits, the notion of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din appears as a mere appendage to that of the hasid. The hasid is also found in numerous other passages in the Mishneh Torah, while lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is invoked only rarely-in five passages in the entire Mishneh Torah, to be precise. Yet, while Maimonides' notion of the hasid is important for our concerns and will enter into our discussion, the question being dealt with in this paper is focused specifically on one issue: how Maimonides interpreted rabbinic sources dealing with lifnim mi- shurat ha- din. Since these sources do not associate lifnim mi-shurat ha-din with the hasid as Maimonides does, the wider issue of the hasid will concern us only to the extent that it helps us answer this question. 4 Scholars have noted a number of differences between Eight Chapters and the Mishneh Torah with respect to the ethical issues that are of concern to us. For example, in</page><page sequence="4">294 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Before examining Maimonides' views on lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in the Mishneh Torah, we must begin with a discussion of Mai- monides' programmatic treatment of ethics in the first two chapters of Laws of Character Traits. This text is known for its ambiguities and inconsistencies and thus requires extensive examination before I deal directly with lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. The value of my lengthy introduction will be confirmed, I hope, by the fruit it bears in the subsequent discussion. Maimonides begins Laws of Character Traits by noting the wide range of character traits (decot) among people;5 for example, some are irascible, others impassive; some are haughty, others meek. The most desirable kind of character trait, however-the "upright way" the fourth chapter of Eight Chapters Maimonides treats the extremism of the hasid as a form of behavior designed to achieve the life of the mean. Deviation from the mean is preventive medicine which safeguards the hasid from the opposite extreme. In the Mishneh Torah, the life of the hasid is presented as a legitimate end in itself. On this point, see Simon Rawidowicz, 'lyyunim be-mahshevet yisrael, ed. Benjamin Ravid (Jerusalem, 1969), 1:439; Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (New Haven, 1980), pp. 459-464; Herbert Davidson, "The Middle Way in Mai- monidean Ethics," Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research 55 (1987) 40-41; Raymond L. Weiss, Maimonides' Ethics (Chicago, 1991), pp. 102-3. Another difference is that in Eight Chapters, Maimonides' discussion of ethics is gov- erned by the goal of achieving a healthy and balanced soul, while in the Mishneh Torah, the aim of ethics is to imitate God. For this point, see Norman Lamm, "The Hakham and the Hasid in the Teaching of Maimonides," (in Hebrew) in The Samuel Belkin Me- morial Volume, ed. Moshe Carmilly and Hayim Leaf (New York, 1981), pp. 12-13, 20-21 n. 3. Another distinction that to my knowledge has escaped the attention of commentators is that in the fourth chapter of the Eight Chapters, Maimonides treats the extremism of the hasid as intrinsic to the ethic of the biblical commandments, whereas in the Mishneh Torah no such suggestion is made. See Maimonides' Com- mentary on the Mishnah, original Judaeo-Arabic text ed. and trans. into modern He- brew by Joseph Kafih (Jerusalem, 1963-1968), vol. 4 (Nezikin), pp. 384-385; an English translation is found in The Ethical Writings of Maimonides, trans. Raymond L. Weiss and Charles Butterworth (New York, 1975), pp. 71-72. An entirely different ap- proach is taken by Barry S. Kogan, in "Hasid, Hakham and Nabi: Maimonides' Con- ception of the Human Ideal" (in Hebrew), Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 9 (1990) 177-192. Kogan argues that the approach towards ethics in Laws of Character Traits is substantially the same as that presented in Eight Chapters, and that in both works Maimonides consistently values the mean as the definitive standard. While Kogan raises some interesting points, my support remains with the majority of scholars who see marked differences between Eight Chapters and Laws of Character Traits with respect to ethics. 5For a discussion of how Maimonides came to use the term decot to denote "character traits," see Weiss, Maimonides' Ethics, p. 89.</page><page sequence="5">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 295 (ha-derekh ha-yesharah) as Maimonides puts it-is the mean be- tween extremes, a doctrine clearly adapted from Aristotle's ethics. According to Maimonides, one who lives according to the mean is called a hakham, "a wise one." Maimonides then gives examples to illustrate how the mean is derived. For instance, with respect to an- ger, one should not allow oneself to be easily angered but should also not be completely impassive like a dead man who feels nothing. One should express anger only over important matters and only as a preventive measure to ensure that the cause of one's anger not recur.6 Maimonides then informs us that someone who deviates some- what from the mean is called a hasid, or "pious one." For example, with respect to the general category of pride, this person will deviate from being modest (Canaw), the mean between the extreme traits of haughtiness (govah ha-lev) and meekness (shefal ruah), and lean to- wards the latter; if he adopts modesty, he is, as noted earlier, a wise one (hakham). Most significant for our purposes is that Maimonides identifies the behavior of the hasid with lifnim mi-shurat ha-din.7 Maimonides has thus far shown a preference for the mean as a way of life; but it is only at this point that he draws out the norma- tive implications of his discussion. He now says that "we are com- manded" to follow the mean since it dictates the "good and upright ways" (ha-derakhim ha-tovim we-ha-yesharim).8 Biblical support for this command is found in the statement, "and you shall walk in his ways" (Deut 28:9). Thus, God himself is the model for acting ac- cording to the mean. The Sages in fact teach the very same lesson in the following dictum: "Just as he is called gracious, so you be gra- cious; just as he is called merciful, so you be merciful; just as he is called holy, so you be holy."9 Acting according to the mean is thus no longer just a desirable way of life, but is equated with the com- mandment to imitate God, the directive which is in fact the heading 6Laws of Character Traits 1.1-4. 7 Ibid., 1.5. 8Ibid., 1.5-6. The standard printed editions have this statement in the middle of paragraph 5. According to Jacob Cohen's comments in Moshe Katzenellenbogen's critical edition of Sefer ha-Mada' (Jerusalem, 1964) this statement should in fact mark the beginning of a new paragraph, a point that seems justified since there is a crucial transition here. 9 Actually, the statement is a combination of biblical and rabbinic sources. The first two traits are cited from Sifre Deut. 49 and bShab 113b. The injunction to imitate God's holiness is adapted from Lev 19:2.</page><page sequence="6">296 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW for this entire section of Laws of Character Traits. As God's actions are dictated by the mean, so must ours be. Maimonides begins the second chapter of Laws of Character Traits with a discussion of those who experience "illness" of the soul by adopting extreme character traits, and the course of therapy that must be undertaken to cure this problem. This person must deal with his spiritual illness by over-correcting to the opposite extreme for a period of time so that eventually he will return to the mean. Thus, for example, an irascible person must practice impassivity for a lengthy period, a haughty person must conduct himself with extreme meekness. 10 At this point, Maimonides adds a somewhat mysterious twist to his discussion. He says that there are two character traits for which it is forbidden to act according to the mean. Because of the impor- tance of this passage, it will be cited in full: In the case of some character traits, a man is forbidden to accustom himself to the mean. Rather, he shall move to the other [i.e., far] ex- treme. One such [character trait] is a haughty heart, for the good way is not that a man be merely humble, but that he have a lowly spirit, that his spirit be very submissive. Therefore, it was said of Moses, that he was "very humble," and not merely humble. 1 And therefore the wise men commanded: "Have a very, very lowly spirit." 12 Moreover they said that everyone who makes his heart haughty denies the exist- ence of God. As it is said: "And your heart shall swell, and you shall forget the Lord your God. 13 In addition, they said, "Whoever has an arrogant spirit-even a little-deserves excommunication." 14 Like- wise, anger is an extremely bad character trait, and it is proper for a man to move away from it to the other extreme and to teach himself not to become angry even over something it is proper to be angry about. Now, he might wish to arouse fear in his children and the mem- bers of his household or in the community (if he is a leader) and to be- come angry at them in order that they return to what is good. Then he shall pretend to be angry in their presence in order to admonish them, but his mind shall be tranquil within himself like a man who feigns an- ger but is not angry. The wise men of old said: "Anyone who is angry- it is as if he worships idols." 15 They said about anyone who is angry: If 0 Laws of Character Traits 2.1-2. 11Num 12:3. 12 mAvot 4.4. 13 bSot 4b, Deut 8: 14. 14 bSot 4b.

The way of the just men is to be insulted but not to insult; they hear themselves re- viled and do not reply; they act out of love and rejoice in afflictions. Scripture says about them: "And those who love Him are like the sun rising in its power." 18 Maimonides tells us that with respect to the quality of pride, one must distance oneself as much as possible from haughtiness and adopt the opposite trait of extreme humility or meekness. It is not enough to be modest which is the mean between these two poles. With anger as well, the mean is not sufficient; one must go to the ex- treme opposite of irascibility towards impassivity. If one has to be angry for disciplinary purposes-for example, with the members of one's household, or, as a person in a position of political authority, with members of one's community-one should feign anger but not actually feel anger. 19 We can begin our analysis of the text by noting a number of significant problems. Perhaps most central is that Maimonides at no point clarifies the exact status of the hasid. He informs us that the de- sirable path is the mean, by which we imitate God. He also tells us that all people must adopt the extreme behavior of the hasid to some extent in that everyone must cultivate the two character traits of meekness and impassivity. But Maimonides does not deal with the status of the hasid who presumably deviates from the mean with re- spect to character traits other than the two exceptions just mentioned. What purpose does such a way of life serve? Does it relate to the ideal of imitating God which is the commandment under discussion?20 6 bPes 66b. '7Ibid., 113b. 18bYom 23a, bGit 36b, Judg 5:3 1. Laws of Character Traits 2.3. The translation is that of Weiss and Butterworth. 19 Throughout this paper I have used Herbert Davidson's translations of the vari- ous ethical traits that Maimonides discusses, appearing in his article, "Middle Way." Thus, "irascibility" and "impassivity" are opposite extremes with "patience" lying in the mean between these two. Similarly, "haughtiness" and "meekness" are extremes, with "humility" as the mean between them. 20 One might look to the fourth chapter of Eight Chapters to answer this question. There Maimonides clearly states that the hasid deviates from the mean as a precaution</page><page sequence="8">298 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Another difficulty that has perplexed medieval and modern com- mentators in the opening discussion of Laws of Character Traits is the significant inconsistency with respect to meekness and impas- sivity. While in the second chapter Maimonides treats meekness and impassivity as traits for which extremism is absolutely mandated, in the two passages just prior to this one he endorses the more moder- ate variations of those very same traits dictated by the mean; thus in Laws of Character Traits 1.4 Maimonides describes the mean be- tween haughtiness and meekness and that between irascibility and impassivity as desirable. Most troubling is that support for the mean with respect to these traits is repeated in Laws of Character Traits 2.2 in the discussion of therapy for those who adopt extreme char- acter traits-that is, immediately before the staunch assertion in 2.3 that the extremes of those very same traits must be the norm. All commentators assume that Maimonides views meekness and impassivity as exceptional traits that everyone must cultivate. The question then is why he deliberately endorses the mean with respect to these traits in the two earlier passages. Different solutions have been proposed for this problem, but I tend to agree with recent com- mentators, such as Herbert Davidson and Daniel H. Frank, who find no explanation entirely satisfactory. 21 (hawta) to ensure that he does not succumb to a particular vice (Kafih, Commentary on the Mishnah, p. 382; Weiss and Butterworth, Ethical Writings of Maimonides, p. 69). This may have been the operative principle in Laws of Character Traits as well. Kogan does in fact argue along these lines; see n. 4 above. The problem with this ap- proach is that this connection is never made in Laws of Character Traits. In Laws of Character Traits 2.2, Maimonides suggests that one should deal with extreme charac- ter traits by over-correcting in the opposite direction, and then he discusses meekness and impassivity, the exemplary traits of the hasid. However, the therapy recom- mended in 2.2 has little to do with the hasid, for it is not to prevent vices, as is the case with the hasid in Eight Chapters, but to cure them once they have taken hold. 21 See Davidson, "Middle Way," pp. 41-44; Daniel H. Frank, "Anger as a Vice: A Maimonidean Critique of Aristotelian Ethics," History of Philosophy Quarterly 7 (1990) 274 -275. Solutions to this problem are suggested by David Rosin, Die Ethik des Maimonides (Breslau, 1876), p. 86f.; Rawidowicz, 'Iyyunim, pp. 439-441, criticizes Rosin and offers his own suggestion. Solutions are also proposed by traditional com- mentators Lehem Mishneh and 'Avodat ha-Melekh. Norman Lamm, "Hakham and Hasid," p. 25 n. 28, attempts to rectify the problem by arguing that Maimonides ad- vises the cultivation of the extreme traits of meekness and impassivity only after he has introduced the notion of imitatio Dei into his discussion. Lamm has overlooked Laws of Character Traits 2.2, which advocates the mean with respect to these traits and appears after Maimonides has invoked the conception of imitatio Dei.</page><page sequence="9">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 299 Another closely-related question that scholars have answered with more success is why Maimonides chose meekness and impassivity as the two exceptional character traits. Marvin Fox argues that Mai- monides' choice reflects the fact that his ethics is ultimately Jewish and not Aristotelian. While Maimonides was able to find harmony between the Aristotelian mean and the Jewish tradition with respect to most other character traits, he bowed to the force of tradition with regard to meekness and impassivity because of the strong biblical and rabbinic support for those qualities.22 Raymond Weiss agrees with Fox, but adds that the two exceptional character traits serve an additional purpose: meekness and impassivity are good preparation for a life of intellectual contemplation.23 The most penetrating analysis has been offered by Daniel H. Frank in two papers dealing with Maimonides' attitude towards humility and anger respectively.24 Frank agrees with Fox and Weiss that the exceptional character traits represent a Jewish bias in Maimonides' ethics; but he further argues that impassivity, for Maimonides, is a virtue exceptional to the mean because it is a key component in his conception of imitatio Dei. Frank draws upon The Guide of the Per- plexed 1.54 in which Maimonides clearly states that the imitation of God requires us to perform the same actions as God performs, but since God's actions are passionless so must ours be. And as Frank points out, Maimonides uses the example of anger to illustrate this idea. He tells us that one should express anger in appropriate situa- tions, but that in imitating God's passionless disposition this anger must be expressed only in action, not in emotion. As Frank argues, this passage provides clues for understanding Maimonides' position on anger in the Mishneh Torah. The passage in the Guide not only advocates an attitude towards anger identical to that described in Laws of Character Traits, but also provides a context and a rationale for it: the imitation of God requires that we perform actions devoid of passion. It is thus clear that in Laws of Character Traits, we must 22 Marvin Fox, Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology, Metaphysics, and Moral Theology (Chicago, 1990), p. 117. 23 Weiss, Maimonides' Ethics, pp. 103-104. 24 Daniel H.

My citations will therefore be from the second article.</page><page sequence="10">300 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW distance ourselves as far as possible from irascibility and train our- selves to be impassive, because this constitutes the imitation of God.25 The great strength of Frank's thesis is that the imitation of God is in fact the commandment which heads up the first section of Laws of Character Traits. It is therefore clear how Maimonides' remarks on impassivity fit into his discussion. How does one explain Maimonides' choice of the other excep- tional character trait? Why must one always be exceedingly meek? Frank has valuable insights here as well. He argues that Mai- monides' discussion of meekness and impassivity is a response to Aristotle. In Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle describes pride and good temper as desirable virtues. Pride is consequent upon feeling self-esteem for one's accomplishments in the moral and political spheres and demanding respect from others for those accomplish- ments. Good temper is the capacity to display anger at appropriate times and in appropriate ways because one is under the rule of rea- son. Moreover, as Frank argues, for Aristotle the two virtues are clearly connected. It is thus no accident that they are discussed con- tiguously in Nichomachean Ethics 4.3-5. As Frank notes, the proud man demands honor from others and will therefore react with anger in the appropriate way if that honor is not respected-or, worse, if he is insulted. Thus, the two traits are linked by the notion of self- esteem. Frank goes on to show that by advocating the extreme traits of meekness and impassivity Maimonides clearly rejects Aristotle's po- sition. Meekness substitutes for Aristotle's pride and impassivity for good temper. Moreover, meekness and impassivity are linked for Maimonides just as pride and good temper were linked for Aristotle. One who demonstrates meekness has the capacity for impassivity. 26 Frank is not entirely clear about the role of meekness for Mai- monides vis-'a-vis the imitation of God. But if I understand him 25 Frank, "Anger as a Vice," pp. 273-277. In the discussion of divine attributes in Laws of the Fundamental Principles of the Torah 1.10-12, Maimonides argues that passions attributed to God in Scripture-anger included-are only metaphorical de- scriptions (mashal u-melisah), given that God cannot experience passion. Therefore even in the Mishneh Torah we have the theoretical formulation of divine attributes that provides the background for the discussion of impassivity in Laws of Character Traits. But it is only in Guide 1.54 that the normative and ethical implications of this idea are drawn out with respect to imitatio Dei. 26 Frank, "Anger as a Vice," pp. 270-273.</page><page sequence="11">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 301 correctly, he argues that for Maimonides meekness is not a trait by which one imitates God-at least not directly. Instead it is in some sense a prerequisite for the imitation of God. By ridding oneself of self-esteem one prepares oneself to focus on God and the imitation of his actions as the best way of life, rather than on self-fulfillment. 27 We can also infer from Frank's analysis that meekness plays a key role in the imitation of God because, as just stated, it is a preparation for the virtue of impassivity, which is central to Maimonides' con- ception of the imitation of God. In order not to feel anger, especially in the face of insult, it is necessary to adopt the virtue of meekness.28 Frank's remarks shed valuable light on Maimonides' discussion of meekness and impassivity in Laws of Character Traits 2.3, in par- ticular the way the passage concludes. As we have already seen, Maimonides first discusses meekness, then impassivity. In conclud- ing his discussion of the latter, Maimonides cites a talmudic source: "The way of the just men is to be insulted but not to insult; they hear themselves reviled and do not reply; they act out of love and rejoice 27Ibid., pp. 277-278. A similar approach is taken by David Hartman in Mai- monides: Torah and Philosophic Quest (Philadelphia, 1976), p. 90f. Hartman tends to conflate the commandment of knowledge of God with that of imitating God, though the two are not necessarily synonymous. The virtue of humility is in fact a ubiquitous theme in Maimonides' ethics. It receives a brief but profound treatment in Bernard Steinberg's essay on humility in Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, eds. Arthur A. Cohen and Paul Mendes-Flohr (New York, 1987), pp. 429-433. Steinberg states that Maimonides perceives humility as an imperative connected to imitatio Dei, but never explains the association. 28One could argue that Maimonides may have emphasized the importance of meekness simply because there are rabbinic sources which see humility as a divine attribute, and that he thus viewed humility as imitatio Dei in a far more direct way than is being argued here. In fact, in his commentary on Avot 4.4, Maimonides cites a number of rabbinic sources which regard humility as one of God's characteristics. But Maimonides nowhere gives a philosophical explanation of what it means for God to have humility as a virtue, and without such a philosophical explanation it is hard to surmise how Maimonides viewed such a highly anthropomorphic attribution. We must keep in mind that for Maimonides rabbinic aggadah must be interpreted in order to get to its true philosophical meaning-especially in an instance like this in which the plain meaning of the rabbinic aggadah is clearly unacceptable to Mai- monides. Thus, in the absence of such an interpretation in this case, we cannot draw any conclusions for our discussion. For Maimonides' views on aggadah, see Guide of the Perplexed, trans. Shlomo Pines (Chicago, 1963), Introduction, pp. 6-7. See also the introduction to Pereq .Helek, in Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah, ed. Kafih, 4:200f.</page><page sequence="12">302 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW in afflictions. Scripture says about them: 'And those who love Him are like the sun rising in its power."'29 It should be noted that while this passage comes at the conclusion of Maimonides' remarks about impassivity, it applies equally to the virtue of meekness. Maimonides specifically addresses how one is to react in situations in which one is faced with insult from others. He makes the point that one must be impervious to such things. This advice is as relevant to the virtue of meekness as it is to that of im- passivity since both are tested in situations of insult. This passage should therefore be viewed as belonging not to Maimonides' re- marks on impassivity alone, but as a kind of summation with respect to both meekness and impassivity as related virtues.30 Thus, a key point in Frank's analysis is in evidence here. To summarize the discussion thus far: in Laws of Character Traits, Maimonides equates the command to imitate God with the doctrine of the mean. There is another standard, that of the hasid, by which a person deviates from the mean towards the extremes. The extreme standard of the hasid applies to everyone with respect to two excep- tional character traits, meekness and impassivity-exceptions that are in accord with Maimonides' conception of the imitation of God. There are also some unresolved problems. Maimonides never clarifies the status of the hasid. Whereas everyone must observe the more extreme standard of the hasid with respect to meekness and im- passivity for the sake of imitating God, Maimonides does not say why the hasid deviates from the mean with respect to other character traits as well. It is also unclear why Maimonides supports the more moderate variations of meekness and impassivity in other passages of the very same discussion in Laws of Character Traits. We can now begin our discussion of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. As noted earlier, Maimonides equates the behavior of the hasid with the concept of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. Thus, by implication, lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is identified with deviation from the mean. Second, the extreme virtues of meekness and impassitivity which everyone 29 See above, p. 297. 30The manner in which Maimonides introduces this passage may support this reading. He begins with the phrase, "The way of the just ones . . . ," which does not appear in the original talmudic source, as if to mark off what follows as a separate thought.</page><page sequence="13">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 303 must practice are the prime instances of acting according to the principle lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. We can now confront the central questions: How did Maimonides appropriate the concept of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din into that of the hasid? More specifically, how did Maimonides convert lifnim mi- shurat ha-din as a legal principle referring to supererogatory behav- ior into a philosophical and ethical one pertaining to character traits? Did Maimonides simply assign his own philosophical meaning to this notion without regard to its use in rabbinic sources? An examination of other passages in the Mishneh Torah in which lifnim mi-shurat ha-din occurs will provide insight into these matters. Since there are only four such passages, I shall examine each one. The first passage appears in the fifth chapter of Laws of the Fun- damental Principles of the Torah, where Maimonides discusses the concepts of "sanctification of the divine name," or qiddush ha-shem, and "profanation of the divine name," or hillul ha-shem. Maimonides first defines these terms in relation to martyrdom, an association well- founded in rabbinic sources, and proceeds to specify a series of rul- ings with respect to this matter. But towards the end of the chapter, he discusses the alternative meaning given to these terms in rabbinic sources as concepts that define the appropriate behavior required of the Torah sage in his everyday dealings with other people:31 There are other things that are a profanation of the Name of God. When a man great in knowledge of the Torah and reputed for his piety does things which cause people to talk about him, even if the acts are not express violations, he profanes the Name of God. As, for exam- ple, if such a person makes a purchase and does not pay promptly, provided he has the means and the creditors ask for payment and he puts them off; or if he indulges immoderately in jesting, eating, or drinking, when he is staying with ignorant people or living among them; or if his mode of addressing people is not gentle, or he does not receive people affably, but is quarrelsome and irascible. The greater a man is the more scrupulous should he be in all such things, and he should act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. And if a man has been scrupulous in his conduct, gentle in his conversation, pleasant towards his fel- low-creatures, affable in manner when receiving them, not retorting even when affronted, but showing courtesy to all, even to those who treat him with disdain, conducting his commercial affairs with integ- rity, not readily accepting hospitality of the ignorant nor frequenting 31bYom 86a.</page><page sequence="14">304 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW their company, not seen at all times, but devoting himself to the study of the Torah, wrapped in talit and crowned with phylacteries, and acting lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, avoiding however, extremes and exag- gerations-such a man has sanctified God. 32 Maimonides tells us that the phrase hillul ha-shem can be applied to a great Torah scholar who acts in an objectionable manner even if his actions are not technically violations of halakhah. Qiddush ha- shem is defined as the converse of this type of behavior. It is significant for our purposes that the key terms of the discus- sion in Laws of Character Traits appear here. One who acts accord- ing to the principle of qiddush ha-shem is characterized as both a hasid and as someone who acts lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. He also dis- plays the twin exceptional virtues of meekness and impassivity. In fact, Maimonides' suggestion that the Torah scholar should not re- spond to the insults of others but should even show respect for those who disdain him, echoes the final summary statement of these vir- tues in Laws of Character Traits 2.3 which we examined earlier. Yet, as much as this passage resonates with the opening discus- sion in Laws of Character Traits, it is of limited use for our purposes because the concept of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is not easily distin- guished from a host of other forms of pious behavior. More impor- tant, the passage provides no insight into how Maimonides read the rabbinic sources which mention lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. A more precise idea of how Maimonides reached his interpreta- tion of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din from rabbinic sources can be derived from the other passages in the Mishneh Torah that invoke this con- cept.33 Laws of Murder and Preservation of Life 13.1-4 states: [1] If, on the road, one encounters a person whose animal is crouching under the weight of its burden, he is enjoined to unload the burden from the animal whether the burden is suited to it or too heavy for it. This is a positive commandment, for Scripture says: "You must nev- ertheless raise it with him" (Ex 23:5).... [3] If the passerby is a priest and the animal is crouching in a cemetery, he may not defile himself on its account, just as he may not defile himself in order to return lost 32 Laws of the Fundamental Principles of the Torah 5.11. The translation, with some minor revisions of my own, is that of Moses Hyamson in his edition of Mai- monides' Book of Knowledge (Jerusalem, 1962). 33 My discussion here does not follow the order of passages as they appear in the Mishneh Torah, but the order of the conceptual development of my own argument.</page><page sequence="15">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 305 property. Similarly, if one is an elder unaccustomed to loading or unloading, he is exempt seeing that the act is not in keeping with his dignity. [4] The general rule is as follows: In every case where if the animal were his own he would load or unload it, he must load or unload another's. But if one is a hasid and acts lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, even if he is a prince of the highest rank, still if he sees another's animal crouching under its burden of straw or sticks or the like, he should help unload and reload.34 Maimonides is dealing with the case of someone who encounters a fellow Jew whose animal is crouching under its burden. Mai- monides cites the biblical injunction that a person in this situation must help his fellow Jew unload the burden and reload it. He also cites the talmudic qualification that one is exempt from such an ob- ligation if it is not in keeping with his dignity to perform this type of task.35 Yet, Maimonides goes on to say that such a person should waive his exemption and offer help to his fellow Jew if he is a hasid and wants to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. We see here that Maimonides' use of the terms hasid and lifnim mi- shurat ha-din is consistent with his presentation in Laws of Character Traits, since he identifies them with at least one of the extreme virtues mandated there. A person is a hasid and exhibits the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din if he waives his exemption from a task that com- promises his dignity. That is, he displays in this act the capacity for meekness. Maimonides appears to have based his application of lifnim mi- shurat ha-din on a rabbinic source that is exclusively concerned with that principle, and in which there is no mention of the hasid :36 R. Ishmael son of R. Yose was walking on a road when he met a man carrying a load of sticks. The man put them down, rested and then said to him [Ishmael], "Help me to pick them up." "What is it [the wood] worth?" Ishmael inquired. "Half a zuz," was the answer. So he [Ishmael] gave the man half a zuz and declared it [the sticks] owner- less. Thereupon the man reacquired it. He [Ishmael] gave him another half zuz and again declared it ownerless. Seeing that again he was about to reacquire it, [Ishmael] said to him, "I have declared it 34The translation, with some minor revisions of my own, is from The Code of Maimonides: Book XI, The Book of Torts, trans. Hyman Klein (New Haven, 1954), p. 233. 35bBM 30b. 36 As noted in Hagahot Maymoniyyot, ad loc.</page><page sequence="16">306 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ownerless for all but you" ..... Was not R. Ishmael son of R. Yose an elder for whom it was undignified [to help one to take up a load]? He acted lifnim mi-shurat ha-din.37 The Gemara cites the case of a man on the road who asks R. Ishmael to help him lift some sticks. R. Ishmael apparently in an attempt to relieve himself of the obligation of helping the man, responds by acquiring the sticks and then declaring them ownerless. The ques- tion is then posed why R. Ishmael felt the need for such a ruse; was he not exempt from the obligation to begin with, because he would as a great Torah scholar compromise his dignity by helping the man? The response given is that R. Ishmael saw himself as obligated lifnim mi-shurat ha-din and therefore had to relieve himself of this obliga- tion by acquiring the sticks and declaring them ownerless. Thus an isolated incident in the Gemara is treated by Maimonides as legal precedent for a general ruling: any person normally exempt from helping a fellow Jew with a burden because his dignity may be com- promised may waive that exemption in order to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. The significance of these observations becomes clear when we look at another passage in the Mishneh Torah in which lifnim mi- shurat ha-din is applied to halakhic matters. In Laws of Robbery and Lost Property, Maimonides mentions lifnim mi-shurat ha-din twice in the same chapter. In 11.7, he deals with the case of a Jew who finds a lost article in a public area populated mainly by non-Jews. Nor- mally, according to biblical injunction, a Jew must make an attempt to locate the owner of lost property if the owner is a fellow Jew. 38 According to rabbinic interpretation this rule does not apply if the owner is a non-Jew. 39 Maimonides therefore rules that if the article was found in a largely non-Jewish area, a Jew need not return the object even if a Jew makes a legitimate claim on it. The presumption is that a Jew who lost an article in such a place would immediately give up hope of it being returned and thus would allow the finder to claim ownership. However, Maimonides says that if one wants to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, one should return the object to his fellow Jew. 37 The translation is adapted from that of Louis Newman in his article, "Law, Vir- tue and Supererogation in the Halakha," pp. 64-65. 38 Deut 22:1-3. 39bBQ 113b.</page><page sequence="17">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 307 Here Maimonides is clearly drawing from a talmudic source which deals with an identical case.40 More will be said about this passage later, but for now it is more important to cite another case taken up in the same chapter: [13] If one finds a sack or a basket, the rule is as follows: If he is a scholar or a respected elder who is not accustomed to taking such things in his hand, he need not concern himself with them. He must, however, examine his own conscience. If he would have taken these things back for himself had they belonged to him, he must also return them when they belong to another. But if he would not have over- looked his dignity even had they belonged to him, he need not return them when they belong to another.... [17] If one follows the good and upright path and acts lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, he will return lost property in all cases, even if it is not in keeping with his dignity.41 Maimonides repeats a talmudic ruling that a person of distinction is not required to return a lost object if handling that object will in some way compromise his dignity. 42 But he adds that if this person wants to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, he will return the object. Two observations are in order here. First, the ethic of lifnim mi- shurat ha-din described in Laws of Character Traits is again in evi- dence. A person exhibits the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din by compromising his dignity and returning a lost object with which he would not normally concern himself, thereby displaying his capacity for meekness. Second, as to the basis of Maimonides' ruling, there is no explicit talmudic source for the application of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. How- ever, medieval commentators generally look to the case regarding R. Ishmael discussed above as the source for Maimonides' ruling, and with good justification.43 What Maimonides seems to have seen in the case of R. Ishmael was the essential idea that according to the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, one should waive a halakhic exemption meant to preserve one's dignity. The application of this principle to lost objects was no doubt encouraged by the fact that the injunction to help a fellow Jew with his burden and the commandment 40 bBM 24b. 41 The translation with minor revisions follows Hyman Klein (above, n. 34), pp. 130-131. 42 mBM 2.8 and bBM 30a-b. 43 See Kesef Mishneh and Maggid Mishneh, ad loc.</page><page sequence="18">308 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to return lost property are often mentioned together in talmudic sources. 44 At this point we begin to see how Maimonides derived his inter- pretation of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din from rabbinic sources and inte- grated it into his philosophical discussion of the hasid in Laws of Character Traits. A key rabbinic source for Maimonides seems to have been the case of R. Ishmael in bBM 30b. It is in this passage alone that the early rabbis specifically connect lifnim mi-shurat ha- din with behavior which compromises one's dignity. Now the Ge- mara never suggests that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is to be defined in all cases as action of this kind; nor is it suggested that R. Ishmael's actions emanated from a cultivated character trait. Nonetheless Mai- monides seems to have taken liberties on both points. He treats the R. Ishmael case as paradigmatic of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. Thus he rules that a person who wishes to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din should also return a lost object even if doing so compromises his dignity.45 More important, Maimonides seems to have made the assumption that a firm ethical disposition was behind R. Ishmael's behavior. This would explain why in Laws of Character Traits he equates lifnim mi-shurat ha-din with the trait of meekness; this virtue, it would seem, lies at the root of the capacity to compromise one's dignity. In short, we can best understand Maimonides' concept of lifnim mi- shurat ha-din by appreciating the centrality of the case of R. Ishmael in the Talmud to Maimonides' thinking. It seems to have served as a basis for Maimonides' application of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in two 44 See for example mBM 2.10 which cites laws concerning the injunction to help someone unload and reload a burden in a chapter concerned with the return of lost property. Note also that in the Gemara the case of R. Ishmael is cited in a discussion of the Mishnah's ruling that one need not return a lost object if doing so compro- mises one's dignity, a ruling which is also cited by Maimonides. In this talmudic passage, the transition from returning lost object to helping others with their burden is made by Rava who, just prior to the case of R. Ishmael, rules that in both in- stances one is obliged to act towards another person's property as one would act to- wards one's own. Rava's wording becomes the basis for that of Maimonides in the passage just quoted. The analogy between the two issues is suggested by the biblical text itself which juxtaposes Deut 22:1-4. 45The same logic, however, does not apply to Maimonides' use of the phrase lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in Laws of Robbery and Lost Property 11.7 in which no mention is made of this principle applying to people whose dignity is at stake. This case is a significant exception which cannot be explained by the theory I am offering here. I will comment on this case below.</page><page sequence="19">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 309 halakhic rulings in the Mishneh Torah. Most important, it appears to have played an important role in inspiring his philosophic and pro- grammatic treatment of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in Laws of Character Traits. But would Maimonides have based his interpretation of lifnim mi- shurat ha-din on a single rabbinic passage? What about the other instances in which lifnim mi-shurat ha-din appears in rabbinic sources? It can be shown that these other sources were also significant for Maimonides. For what is interesting to note is that in practically every halakhic discussion in the Babylonian Talmud in which the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is applied to a specific case, what is involved is a case of a rabbi interacting with someone of no special status, often a common fellow Jew. Most often the rabbi waives a legal right in deference to the other party. A brief summary of these cases will clarify this point: 1. In bBQ 99b, a ruling is made that money-changers are not liable for errors provided they are experts in their trade. Yet R. Hiyya, who is an expert money-changer, reimburses a woman when he makes a mistake. He does this according to the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. 2. In bKet 97a, a ruling is made that one may rescind a sale if it was explicitly conditional on the ability of the seller to use the pro- ceeds for a specific purpose-for example, moving to the land of Is- rael-and it turns out that for whatever reason the condition cannot be fulfilled. If the seller had only private intent of such a condition, he cannot rescind the sale. Yet R. Pappa agreed to return land he had bought from someone, although the seller had only private intent of a condition for the sale and this condition did not materialize. This is attributed to R. Pappa's desire to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. 3. In bBer 45b, there is a discussion about zimun, the introductory invocation for grace after meals requiring the participation of three adult males. A ruling is made that one person cannot force two others to interrupt their meals to join the quorum. Yet a case is reported in which R. Pappa and another man acceded to his son's request for a zimun and joined the quorum. The Gemara concludes that R. Pappa acted lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. This case is somewhat different from the others since the interaction is between a father and his son. Nev- ertheless the same principle operative in the other cases is evident here as well: a rabbi waives a legal right in deference to someone of lower standing, in this case his own son</page><page sequence="20">310 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW All these instances involve a rabbi waiving a legal right of some sort and deferring to someone of lesser status. The only exception is a case in bBM 24b, Maimonides' ruling on which has already been mentioned. In a discussion between Mar Samuel and R. Judah, the question arises as to whether one should return a lost object found in a crowded market-place frequented by non-Jews, even if a Jew comes forward and properly identifies it. Mar Samuel concludes that one need not do so on the assumption that the owner would have given up hope of retrieving it in such a place, but that one should nonethe- less return it according to the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. It is not clear if this advice regarding the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is directed at R. Judah alone or if it is of more general appli- cation. Maimonides in his ruling on this matter seems to presume that it applies to everyone. Nonetheless, this last case aside, it would seem that the element of social standing in the talmudic sources on lifnim mi-shurat ha-din was crucial for Maimonides' formulation. He perceived that the tal- mudic usage of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din almost always involved rab- bis waiving their legal rights in deference to common Jews. He therefore assumed that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din was a principle which mandated that men of superior social-standing defer to those of lower standing. The case of R. Ishmael was significant because it gave Maimonides a specific rationale for this behavior by indicating that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din involves compromising one's dignity. From here it was not difficult for Maimonides to take the next step and assume that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din reflects a specific ethical disposition that prompts such behavior.46 46 One other talmudic source that ought to be mentioned is a celebrated case in bBM 83a. Some porters hired by Rabbah son of R. Hanan broke a barrel of wine in the course of handling it, and because they were apparently negligent, they were lia- ble for damages. To guarantee restitution, Rabbah took possession of their clothes as surety, but the porters complained to Rav who ordered Rabbah to pay them their wages and return their clothes. When Rabbah in turn complained that this was not dictated by the law, Rav rejected Rabbah's complaint and responded with a verse from Proverbs, "And keep the path of the righteous" (Prov 2:20). Even though this case is often used as the prime example of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, that principle is never actually mentioned in this passage. It is Rashi who understands Rav's ruling as an exhortation to Rabbah to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. We could easily read this case as reinforcing Maimonides' conception of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. However, Maimonides never comments on this case in the Mishneh Torah. Also we cannot assume that Maimonides was familiar with Rashi's interpretation.</page><page sequence="21">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 311 This observation explains why three of the four instances in which Maimonides applies lifnim mi-shurat ha-din to a specific case in- volve people of superior social standing of one sort or another. This is evident in Maimonides' application of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in his discussion of qiddush ha-shem in Laws of the Fundamental Prin- ciples of the Torah 5.11, where the great Torah scholar well-known for his piety specifically is enjoined to act according to the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. The same applies to Maimonides' use of this concept in the two other passages we examined. A person of sta- tus will return a lost object or help a fellow Jew with his burden, even if he is technically exempt from such duties, if he wants to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. The element of social status comes through especially in the latter case when Maimonides argues that this type of special behavior should be exhibited even by someone who is "a prince of the highest rank."47 Does this mean that for Maimonides lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is only applicable for those of superior social standing? One hesitates to draw this conclusion given that his programmatic discussion in Laws of Character Traits makes no such suggestion. In fact, the con- trary appears to be true: everyone is mandated to adopt meekness and impassivity as virtues. Thus, while the paradigmatic cases of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din may deal with those of superior social standing, Maimonides seems to have felt that this principle applied to others as well. We should also keep in mind that there is one halakhic application in the Mishneh Torah in which behavior according to lifnim mi-shurat ha-din does not involve a person of any special social status. As we saw earlier in Laws of Robbery and Lost Property, Maimonides rules that one who wants to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din will return a lost object to a fellow Jew even if it is found in a public area frequented by non-Jews. This ruling is based on the conversation between Mar Samuel and R. Judah in bBM 24b, but there is no suggestion that the one who returns the object is a person who must compromise his 47 See above, p. 303. One might object that an association of lifnim mi-shurat ha- din with those of superior social standing comes as no surprise. If the defining char- acter traits of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din are meekness and impassivity, it is clearly a person of this sort for whom this principle will most apply. The problem with this reasoning is the assumption that Maimonides first formulated his philosophical posi- tion on lifnim mi-shurat ha-din before applying it to specific cases. I have argued the reverse; Maimonides' inferred his philosophical positionfrom those cases.</page><page sequence="22">312 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW dignity. This case therefore indicates that social status is not always a factor in Maimonides' thinking on lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. It also shows that Maimonides may have thought of this principle as appli- cable to a broader range of ethical behavior than that which involves meekness and impassivity alone. One exceptional case, however, is not a sufficient basis for us to draw firm conclusions about these speculations. We have yet to examine what was perhaps the most significant rabbinic source for Maimonides' interpretation of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. Surprisingly, it is a well-known aggadah that appears in bBer 7a: Whence do we learn that the Holy One who is blessed prays? It is writ- ten: "I will bring them to my holy mountain and I will make them joy- ful in my house of prayer [lit. the house of my prayer]" [Is 56:7]. It does not say "their prayer," but rather "my prayer." Thus we learn that the Holy One who is blessed prays. What does God pray? Said Rav Zutra bar Tuvia, Rav said, "May it be my will that my mercy may suppress my anger and my mercy prevail over my other attributes, so that I deal with my children according to the attribute of strict mercy and on their behalf act [lit. enter] lifnim mi-shu rat ha-din." It was taught: R. Ishmael ben Elisha said, "I once entered into the innermost part [of the Sanc- tuary] to offer incense and saw Akatriel Yah, the Lord of Hosts, seated upon a high and exalted throne." He said to me, "Ishmael, My son, bless me!" I replied, "May it be your will that your mercy suppress your anger and your mercy may prevail over your other attributes, so that you may deal with your children according to the attribute of mercy and on their behalf act [lit. enter] lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. And he nodded with his head.48 We can see how this source was perhaps key for Maimonides' think- ing on the issue under examination. In this passage lifnim mi-shurat ha-din clearly involves, among other things, the quality of quelling anger. Thus, Maimonides may have taken this source as proof that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is not only a principle denoting a certain type of behavior, but that it does indeed emanate from an ethical disposition, and one of a specific sort. Moreover, the ethical trait of quelling anger is depicted as a quality exhibited by God himself. 48 The translation is adapted from that of Louis Newman in his article, "Law, Vir- tue and Supererogation in the Halakhah," p. 68.</page><page sequence="23">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 313 Thus, Maimonides could have seen this source as supporting the no- tion that by cultivating this quality we imitate God.49 Furthermore, as Louis Newman points out, this aggadah appears to exhibit the same legal principle which informs the halakhic ap- plications of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din in other talmudic sources. Here lifnim mi-shurat ha-din involves the waiving of a legal right in that God is abstaining from implementing the terms specified by the covenant that allows him to punish the Jewish people for their sins.50 To take this one step further, we can also argue that we find here the same social element that we saw in other talmudic cases of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din and that was so relevant for Maimonides. In this case it is God himself, the Being of ultimate superior social standing, who shows deference to his inferior creatures by refrain- ing from punishing them although it is his right to do so. In Mai- monidean terms, it is God who "bears insult" without himself "insulting" others.51 To summarize: In formulating his conception of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, Maimonides was inspired by an original and insightful read- ing of rabbinic sources filtered through a philosophic lens. A series of halakhic sources in the Talmud indicated to Maimonides that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din involves the capacity for people of superior social standing to compromise their dignity in their interaction with others. Most important in this regard was the case of R. Ishmael which explicitly mentions the compromising of dignity in relation to lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. Maimonides inferred from these cases that this capacity is rooted in the ethical trait of meekness. The aggadic 49 Again one must keep in mind that for Maimonides rabbinic aggadah properly interpreted is a body of literature containing important philosophical lessons. See n. 28 above. 50 Newman, "Law, Virtue and Supererogation in the Halakhah," pp. 68-69. 51 One might speculate that Maimonides also took account of the well-known talmu- dic source in bBM 30b which blames the destruction of Jerusalem on the Jews for not acting lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. In Laws of Character Traits 2.3 he cites a passage from the Talmud, bSot 4b, to emphasize the dangers of haughtiness: "Everyone who makes his heart haughty denies the existence of God, as it is said: 'And you heart shall swell, and you shall forget the Lord your God' (Deut 8:14)." It is interesting to note that the prooftext for this passage is a section in Deuteronomy in which God threatens destruction on the entire people of Israel, a warning commonly interpreted in rabbinic tradition to refer to the later exile. Recontextualized in Maimonides' discussion, the tal- mudic statement appears to say that the cause of the exile was haughtiness, which in Maimonidean terms means failure to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din.</page><page sequence="24">314 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW source in bBer 7a confirmed for Maimonides that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is indeed a form of behavior rooted in a specific ethical disposition, but here the emphasis was on quelling anger, a virtue conceptually related to meekness. The same aggadic source also in- dicated that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is ultimately a principle prac- ticed by God himself, and therefore by implication one worthy of imitation. These thoughts were further refined by other considerations. First, meekness and impassivity were virtues which met with profuse praise in rabbinic sources. Second, these virtues had philosophical meaning. Maimonides endorsed meekness and impassivity as cognate virtues in opposition to Aristotle who supported pride and good temper as de- sirable virtues. Maimonides also had philosophical reasons as to why each of these virtues was desirable. Impassivity constitutes the imi- tation of God who is a passionless being incapable of feeling anger. Meekness is a propaedeutic to the imitation of God, for it takes the focus away from the self and places it on God, while at the same time allowing us to behave with impassivity, especially in situations of insult. Maimonides thus concluded that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is behavior deviating from the mean, that its essential expression is in meekness and impassivity, and that it is imitative of God. How Maimonides then associated lifnim mi-shurat ha-din with the ,hasid is not entirely clear. Maimonides may have first formulated his concept of the hasid and then found it in harmony with his under- standing of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. Or Maimonides' formulation of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din may have preceded his concept of the ,hasid. That is, Maimonides' conception of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din may have shaped the contours of his notion of the hasid, and not the reverse. Still, there is much about the relationship between the two con- cepts that needs to be clarified, and this is beyond the scope of this paper. In some of this halakhic rulings Maimonides invokes the con- cept of the ,hasid in a manner consistent with his notion of lifnim mi- shurat ha-din without mentioning the latter. For instance, in Laws of Character Traits 6.9, he applies the term hasid to someone who for- gives another person who has wronged him because the latter is a common man (hedyot) or mentally defective. In Laws of the Study of the Torah 7.12, Maimonides ruling that a Torah scholar is allowed to excommunicate someone who has insulted him in order to safeguard his honor. But he recommends against this and specifically refers to the hasid as a model of one who accepts insults and is forgiving to-</page><page sequence="25">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 315 wards those who disdain him. In Laws of Slaves 9.8, Maimonides rules that one is allowed to work a non-Jewish slave with vigor, but should nonetheless adopt the standing of the hasid and be kind and merciful. In all these instances, the same ethic which we saw devel- oped with respect to lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is evident, that is, a person in a position of authority waives his legal right with respect to someone of inferior standing, thereby displaying the qualities of meekness and impassivity. But this picture is complicated by a number of instances in the Mishneh Torah in which the term hasid is used in a way that has little to do with our analysis of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. For example, the hasid is associated with ethical behavior broadly defined.52 In some cases, the hasid is someone who displays extraordinary conduct in ritual activity.53 Yet, even if it is not possible within the scope of this paper to determine the precise relationship between the hasid and lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, it is certain that Maimonides creatively interpreted the rabbinic sources dealing with lifnim mi-shurat ha-din and that this understanding dovetailed with his concept of the hasid. Maimonides' conception of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din highlights the uniqueness of the Mishneh Torah and the originality of Maimonides as halakhic interpreter. It serves as an excellent example of his talent for redefining halakhic concepts by combining philosophical notions with a careful reading of rabbinic sources. There is one final consideration to be addressed. What implication does our analysis have for the modern debate about lifnim mi-shurat ha-din? Specifically, is lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, according to Mai- monides' definition, a principle intrinsic to the halakhic system or is it extra-halakhic? A number of views have been expressed on this issue. Aharon Lichtenstein argues that for Maimonides lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is a halakhic obligation for everyone because it is presented in a dis- cussion about the commandment to imitate God.54 Louis Newman argues that Maimonides presents lifnim mi-shurat ha-din as a super- erogatory ethic which is entirely voluntary. He points out that in the 52E.g., Laws of Gifts to the Poor 4.8. 53E.g., Laws of Defilement of Foods 16.12. 54Lichtenstein, "Ethic Independent of Halakha?" pp. 71-74. Lichtenstein does not explain how it is an expression of the imitation of God.</page><page sequence="26">316 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW opening discussion of Laws of Character Traits, lifnim mi-shurat ha- din is introduced as a form of saintly behavior that is optional-and not even necessarily desirable in comparison with behavior accord- ing to the mean. As evidence, Newman cites other examples in the Mishneh Torah such as Laws of Robbery and Lost Property 11.7, where lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is clearly optional and is reserved for those of a particularly saintly disposition.55 Joshua Halberstam sim- ilarly argues that for Maimonides lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is reserved for an elite group of people.56 My own view on the matter, at least according to the evidence we have examined in the Mishneh Torah57_is that on this point Mai- monides is genuinely ambiguous. Newman and Halberstam are cor- rect in noting that in Laws of Character Traits, Maimonides appears to present lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, at least initially, as an optional form of behavior. It is introduced as a principle defining the behav- ior of the hasid who deviates from the mean and it is the mean which is the path that we are commanded to followed. They are also correct in noting that Maimonides tends to depict behavior accord- ing to the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din as optional when the principle is applied to specific halakhic rulings elsewhere in the Mishneh Torah. But Newman and Halberstam overlook the fact that in Laws of Character Traits, Maimonides presents meekness and impassivity as the two virtues most exemplary of the behavior of the hasid and the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, and these quali- ties are in no way optional; everyone is mandated to cultivate them. Lichtenstein is also right-as our analysis has shown-that Mai- monides' conception of lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is identified with the command to imitate God, which indeed suggests that the latter is not just an optional form of behavior. We might be able to rectify the inconsistency in part by separating the directive to cultivate certain ethical traits and the imperative to ex- press those traits in specific forms of action. Maimonides believed that all people should cultivate the character traits of meekness and impassivity which cause one to act lifnim mi-shurat ha-din. Thus, the 55 Newman, "Law, Virtue and Supererogation in the Halakha," pp. 77-78. 56 Halberstam, "Supererogation in Halakhah and Shari'a," pp. 92-93. 57 We must keep in mind that another discussion involving lifnim mi-shurat ha- din is found in the fourth chapter of Maimonides' Eight Chapters, and that the differ- ences between this discussion and that found in the Mishneh Torah are substantial enough that conclusions drawn with regard to the latter may not apply to the former.</page><page sequence="27">LIFNIM MI-SHURAT HA-DIN IN MAIMONIDES-EISEN 317 imperative in Laws of Character Traits is presented as a general man- date. However, Maimonides may have also recognized that most peo- ple would find this directive difficult to fulfill. Therefore when dealing with the practical application of the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha- din in his halakhic rulings, he presents this form of behavior as optional. Thus, Maimonides seems to have felt that the cultivation of character traits associated with the principle of lifnim mi-shurat ha- din is something towards which everyone should aspire. But he un- derstood that it was unrealistic to expect all people to succeed in liv- ing according to this stringent standard.</page></plain_text>
