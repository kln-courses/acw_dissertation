PP. 56. $1.50o. In the fifty-odd pages of his study of Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, Professor Bennett Weaver has presented a rich and illuminating criticism of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 105 a work which he considers "one of the bravest and rarest productions of genius in English literature." It is not intended, as he warns the reader in the Preface, as an introduction to the poem: it "is designed to be read only after concentration" upon the drama itself. It is directed, therefore, to the mature and experienced student of Shelley. That student will find much that is familiar to him from his own reading of the poem and of other critics. Yet there are no footnotes: Pro- fessor Weaver has written "with a conscious disregard" of what others have said, with his eye constantly trained on the work of art itself. It would be surprising indeed if he had not reached many of the same conclusions as those of other scholars. But some of his points are new and his approach is individual. His whole study is devoted to showing that Prometheus Un- bound is not only bravest in its ideas but also rarest in its artistry. He sup- ports his judgments by a careful reading of the poem along three main lines. He considers in turn the scene of the drama, its structure, and its dramatis personae, bringing evidence from the poem to prove his thesis that it is "a thing complete in itself." All three contribute to the realization that "the action of this play is es- sentially action within the mind as the mind contemplates laws and princi- ples." The settings, which range from the throne of Jupiter above to the throne of Demogorgon below with the heights of the Caucasus between, give to the imagination the sense of spaciousness and light which corres- pond to the largeness and brilliance of the ideas. The structure of the drama moves from action to song--the fourth act is no mere afterthought. It moves also from Time, in which Jupiter or Evil triumphs, to Eternity, in which the timeless principles of Good overcome and bind down Evil. With the downfall of Jupiter, "a universal law has come into effect.. . and Time dies into Eternity. Evil is caught by its own nature and destroyed; Good is released through its own nature and triumphs. As a dramatic consequence, from this point on in the drama the need is for celebration and song." Finally the characters in this drama of the entombment of Time in Eternity are truly supernatural beings, timeless, not anthropomorphic but "creatures of the mind alone." They are absolutes, "not of Homer, not of Aeschylus, but of Plato." They take the reader with them into the world of the essential, the real, the eternal. This is true, Professor Weaver shows, not only of the "protagonists" (an incidental query--can there be more than one protago- nist?) but of the lesser characters, including the Voices. Professor Weaver has high words of praise for the ideas, the artistic control of scene and pattern and character, the beauty of the poetry in Pro- metheus Unbound. He acknowledges only a few minor faults: one scene (Act III, Sc. 2) "the setting of which I cannot interpret as peculiarly signifi- cant"; the "comparative poverty and weakness" of the unlyrical third act. With his enthusiasm and his judgments this reviewer heartily agrees. Yet one could wish for greater restraint in the use of superlatives; Professor Weaver might then have been more convincing to those (and they still exist) who see in the drama only formless lyricism and futile idealism. There is room too in a criticism like this for some use of Shelley's other words. As</page><page sequence="3">106 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL Professor Weaver says, "there is little in Shelley that does not lead up to Prometheus Unbound or that does not come to consummate expression in the drama." The inclusion of evidence for this statement would, in my opinion, have enriched the discussion of this masterwork-though I realize that it was the author's intention to avoid such parallels. He might, how- ever, without violating his contract with himself, have quoted some sen- tences from the Preface to Prometheus Unbound, for their appositeness to his thesis. One brief passage, for example, expresses Shelley's intention to set the drama within the mind: The imagery which I have employed will be found, in many instances, to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind, or from those external actions by which they are expressed. This booklet gathers together what Shelley's admirers have thought and believed about Prometheus Unbound and puts it freshly. Professor Weaver's emphasis on the dramatic structure is an answer to such a judgment as that in the recent Penguin Shelley, A Selection, edited by Isabel Quigley, who says that Shelley "lacked almost entirely a dramatic sense." He adds also some new insights into a familiar poem. His interpretation of the differences between Panthea and Ione has rehabilitated the youngest of the Oceanides, who has sometimes been regarded as a weak and even an unnecessary charac- ter. His comparison between Prometheus Unbound and the Greek dramas has considerably extended our understanding of the use that Shelley made of his classical models. The poet himself explained his departure from the original story and the similarity of his imagery to that of the Greeks. Pro- fessor Weaver in addition points out the difference between Shelley's lyrics and the functional choruses in the Greek plays, and the difference between the anthropomorphic deities of Aeschylus and Homer and Shelley's "truly supernatural beings." Those who, having read and pondered Prometheus Unbound, wish to have their understanding and appreciation supported, extended, and deep- ened should read and ponder this book. It will serve to correct some mis- judgments on the part of the critical descendants of Matthew Arnold. And, in spite of Professor Weaver's disclaimer, it can "introduce" the young student to subtleties and values which he might otherwise miss. Goucher College ELIZABETH NITCHIE</page></plain_text>
