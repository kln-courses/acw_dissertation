Reviewed by Joan Retsinas, Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The Me in Me and My Captain is a doll who dreams that the cap tain of the fishing boat poised on the sill beneath her shelf will come marry her. In their "cozy" happiness the doll will exult in a domesticity worthy of Family Circle as she cooks, serves, cleans, and tends. Spare line drawings evoke the wistful mood of this ro mantic daydreamer, and the lyrical text almost sings of anticipated joy. This lonely doll yearns to serve and, in serving, to define herself in relation to another person. Six to nine year old children, how ever, may be revelling so in their burgeoning self-sufficiency as they build an extrafamilial life in school that they will not understand this need to serve. They will wonder why the doll does not yearn to sail, or fish, or simply garner exotic presents from her captain. In a world of emerging feminism, Goffstein has focused on a traditional mother-father-baby (one appears in the last pages) setting that, in addition to alienating pint-sized feminists, will bore even "liberat ed" boys unable to empathize with the doll's domestic yearnings. Let's Play Desert, Tom and Polly decide; and, in their nursery Critically Speaking</page><page sequence="2">school sandbox, they construct a cold, dry, yet flowering desert replete with camels, telephone, pyramids, a labyrinth, mirages, and a lost Tarzan. On each page Tom and Polly utter an adult truism about deserts and come up with a child's perception of their utter ance. Inger and Lasse Sandberg have described Let's Play Desert constructions from the perspective of the child constructors; if se quences seem unrelated and discordant, then that is because Tom and Polly's ramblings have followed what adults perceive as dis cordant thought. An adult eavesdropper to a child's "Let's play house .. . post office ... restaurant . .." would recognize the same spontaneity, garbled interpretations of adult practices, and candid didacticism. Large, colorful, detailed pictures will delight young listeners; and the simple text describes a pastime familiar to children who have played in sand. With some help, seven to eight year old chil dren should be able to read this book themselves and, with a bit of prodding, children should start to write and draw their own "Let's play jungle ... cave ... forest..." tales. Bravo to Beatrix Sch?ren for Tillol Though children weaned on animals ? la Richard Scarry may not warm to Tillo, teachers should welcome this tale of an owl neither amusing nor colorful nor humanized. A groundskeeper discovers a wounded baby owl and entrusts it to three children, who conscientiously nurse it from a "small bundle of feathers" to a "proper tawny owl." In such a domesticated setting, however, Tillo does not learn to catch mice, kill grasshoppers, or even fly. Painstakingly the children teach Til lo owl skills until finally, in a sad victory for the children, Tillo flies away. At the first listening or reading, children may dismiss Tillo as boring. Woodcut-like illustrations, in muted green/brown forest hues, complement the text, yet do not lure children with vivid col ors or stylized designs. Tillo himself is neither sympathetic nor lov able; for, eschewing the anthropomorphic route, Sch?ren has care fully reconstructed the plight of a forest owl lost in a human world, not a domesticated pet. With teacher-prompted discussions, how ever, Tillo and his displacement can introduce urban children to some of the subtler distinctions between the world of animals and of men.</page></plain_text>
