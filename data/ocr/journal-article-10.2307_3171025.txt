Mark Wigley The Displacement of Structure and Ornament in the Frankfurt Project: An Interview Michael Hays: The distinction between the work of archi- tecture as an object, in all its aesthetic presence and plenti- tude, and the work of theory as a commentary on that object-an explication, valuation, or justification-has been maintained as fundamental within architectural the- ory. One thinks of functionalism as a general and recurrent theoretical attachment to modernist works; but even in the early projects of Peter Eisenman, to give a more specific example, one senses that the object is still held distinct from the theoretical text, even though it is not fully there without the theory attached to it. How does the Frankfurt Project fit into this logic? Is it a continuation of the aes- thetic object / theoretical text distinction? Or is it, with its emphasis on the textual strategies of its meaning con- struction, an attempt to collapse that distinction, to have the object, as it were, become the critical text? Mark Wigley: The project employs the aesthetic of mod- ernism, the aesthetic of function. The laboratories are or- ganized in a completely modernist way. But the project starts to tamper with the traditional relationship between the aesthetic object and the critical text by actually flaunt- ing the aesthetic tradition it calls into question. It employs that aesthetic confidently, if not dangerously, because the real game of the project is an attempt to undermine that tradition. The project is not concerned with representing function. On the contrary, it is an extremely functional project; it is more functional than its uncynically modern- ist competition. So it employs the aesthetic of modernism on the outside of the laboratory buildings in a very cagey, 51</page><page sequence="2">assemblage 5 slippery sort of way: the aesthetic of functional specificity is used in the functionally nonspecific areas of the building- in the repetitive base blocks, which could have been built at any time in the last fifty years. The areas that seem least modern, that appear contingent and merely added to the base blocks, are in fact completely functionally specific. So already the relationship between ideology and aesthetics is being tampered with. For the modernists, this was not an aesthetics of function; it simply was function, articulated on the surface of an internally functional organism. In the Frankfurt Project the modern functionalism is understood as a kind of veneer, without sacrificing functionality. There is here an implied criticism of modernism, a suggestion that the modernists were conserving an aesthetic of func- tion rather than the functions themselves. This is why the project is almost cavalier in its use of a very familiar aes- thetic. But the main game played by the project involves the rela- tionship between those base units and what appears to be some kind of ornamental chaos added to them. This game has precisely the effect of undermining traditional thinking about the organization of an aesthetic object; and this game is a specifically theoretical intervention. Its grossest symptom is that, from the outside, the project clearly con- sists of some base units to which has been added, at some time, some extra piece. But the closer you look at the proj- ect, the more you know about the object. You discover that the very same logic has generated the base unit and the "addition," so that the addition no longer seems to be simply an addition; it is no longer an ornament; it is part of the same logic. Our thinking about the base units then starts to change. We start to suspect that the base units have always harbored a certain chaos and that the cool, clean proportions of, in this case, a modernist aesthetic actually veiled and contained within their logic this chaotic jumble, which appears on the front. And the moment we start to read those two parts as being the same, our think- ing about the structural elements of architecture begins to be undermined. Therefore, I think that one level of answer to your ques- tion would be that if you can undermine the traditional relationship between structure and ornament, you neces- sarily, in my view, have undermined the traditional rela- tionship between aesthetics and theory, because that relationship is thoroughly dependent on the tradition in which ornament is added to structure (and I would em- phatically argue that this tradition includes both classical and modern architecture). I am suggesting the undermining of this tradition by making it more difficult to distinguish between order and disorder. Ornament is always conceived of as potentially dangerous, potentially chaotic; and, therefore, it must be tamed. Ornament must be made servile to structure pre- cisely because ornament lies in the dangerous realm of representation and can mislead us, take us away from the natural presence of harmony and order. Architectural the- ory has always attempted to tame ornament, to make it represent structure, to articulate structure. Structure itself has been protected from interrogation. The whole disci- pline of architectural theory is set up to protect that de- scription of the object on which all our culture depends: the object as reliable, safe, and secure, grounded in a sub- structure and a superstructure. Now if you produce a proj- ect that changes the condition of ornament, if ornament is articulated as a critique of structure, then the status of your theoretical position changes as well; anyone who launches the interrogation of structure, by definition, changes the status of theory. If it is the case that the whole discipline is set up to protect this view of the object, to enable the whole of our culture to maintain its traditional ways of operating, to maintain its security, then any architectural theory that tampers with that view is not just tampering with descriptions of architecture; it is also tampering with the way we construct ideas. So there is a kind of circular argument here: if we could successfully change the way we conceive of the object, change the status of the object, then we will have changed the status of theory. Theory is constructed on the basis of a certain view of the object. Another way of putting it is that the ideal view of the ob- ject has been of the object as present, reliably present: tan- gibly, directly, meaningfully there, locked into the security of the ground. Any further formulations are merely supple- ments, outside the object, inhabiting the suspect realm of representation. The line between ground and ornament, mediated by substructure and superstructure, is a line be- 52</page><page sequence="3">Wigley tween presence and representation. So architectural theory devoted itself to making ornament conform to a fantasy about structure. By turning that fantasy into a nightmare, this project displaces theory. At the end of the day, the theory that was used to produce the Frankfurt Project doesn't matter. It is dissimulated by the very object it pro- duces. The critical work has been loaded into the object. The object takes over. Its formal moves call the theoretical moves into question. The theoretical test of this object is the critical work of the object itself, what we would have previously denigrated as merely its aesthetic. I am saying that it is now sufficient to make an aesthetic reading of this object, ignoring the theory used by the ar- chitect to produce the object. Or, we should say, the the- ory pretended to be used by the architect to produce this object, because the entire way in which theory relates to the object is now called into question. All that matters is the condition of the object. This is a theoretical object to be understood as a piece of criticism. And we can identify those things that have been criticized quite clearly; they're marked in this project in terms of its anthropomorphism, its symmetry, and its employment of the modern aesthetic. MH: Just to be clear on that last point: that it is precisely the shadow of anthropomorphism, symmetry, and certain classical ways of spatial organization; or that it is precisely the employment of the functionalist aesthetic or the Zei- lenbau organization; that it is the shadow of these ordering systems, which are still in the Frankfurt Project, that en- ables it to engage in a direct criticism of the classical and modern traditions. MW: Absolutely. It is not a revolutionary overthrow of the classical or the modern tradition. You would have to say, without any trace of cynicism at all, that this is a very classical project, in its ordering, its construction. You would also have to say without cynicism that this is a mod- ern project. Rather than being a revolutionary project that attempts to set up a new system, the project undermines both the classical and the modern traditions and discovers within those traditions certain hidden qualities that it then exploits aesthetically and theoretically. So the project is really about the exploitation of the tradition rather than its overthrow. It is not a new architecture. Rather it is a sug- gestion that all previous architecture carries within it this same doubt. So the claim is not that here is an object that tampers with the relationship between structure and orna- ment in a new way, but that here is a project that has made thematic certain traditional dilemmas about the rela- tionships between structure and ornament, relationships previously glossed over. The suggestion is that architecture never was the reassuring thing that philosophy, which is to say culture, wanted. Typically, the architect provides security. Especially with postmodernism, in which the architect becomes a sort of decorator, it is important that the decoration conform to the underlying logic. Architecture is the most conservative of all the disciplines. It is obsessed with foundations. But it is crucial to note that the Frankfurt Project does not simply reject that conservative position, but rather identifies with it, undermining and depowering structures without simply overthrowing them. So it would be wrong to declare that this is an avant-garde project. It is disturbing and alienating, but the disturbance is not the external disturbance of the tradition. It suggests that the center was always disturbed. MH: I'm still interested in the relationship of the Frankfurt Project to modernism, to the post-Enlightenment, modern tradition of architecture. And part of what you're saying denies a rupture between modernism and the present, a rupture of the sort claimed either by conservative postmod- ernists (the back-to-the-future, let's-pretend-the-Modern- Movement-never-happened sort of postmodernists) or by post-structuralist postmodernists. But also embedded in the question is the politics of the Frankfurt Project's relation- ship to modernism. So let me try to get at the question through the second point first: For example, an avant-garde project like Hannes Meyer's League of Nations competition defetish- izes the presence of the object in a very specific way. Meyer undermines the object from within a materialist logic whose economy is articulated on the basis of concepts such as matter, contradiction, reproducibility, banality, etc.--concepts that, from within the object itself, point to processes outside the object that (over)determine its forma- 53</page><page sequence="4">assemblage 5 tion. So what we see when we look at Meyer's League of Nations is not an isolated, aesthetic object; the object itself undermines that way of seeing. What we see are the traces of the multiple and differentiated processes that operate outside the provenance of the object and declare its inade- quacy as a representation. In this undermining of presence in favor of process, and of contemplation in favor of action, Meyer's politics are fairly clear. In the Grundrisse, Marx himself discusses that the way to analyze capitalism is to understand it not as being- that's his word-but as a constant becoming, that is, to undermine presence in favor of process. And, of course, I think that Meyer's project is a Marxist version of defetishiz- ing presence; Meyer's enterprise is inscribed in the logic of historical materialism and dialectical materialism. It takes place at a crucial moment in history, when the undermin- ing of the object is simultaneously an undermining of the classical, bourgeois subject, who seeks to see in the auton- omous object an image of a stable, autonomous self; who sees the object as an inducement to, and a metaphor of, a transcendental subject. Meyer undermines this conception of the subject in favor of a class-specific, historically spe- cific subject. The Frankfurt Project similarly attempts to undermine presence, I believe, to put presence under erasure, let's say. But it does so in a generalized, formalized way; it is not class specific or historically specific. Its claimed heterogeneity and alterity have little to do with the actual experience of radically differentiated spaces or the actual experience of others in society. Therefore, its politics, for me, are different. I'm not sure what they are; I don't think it is enough to say that it is apolitical. And the question may involve, more generally, questions of the politics of deconstruction in architecture in America. MW: I would say that, in the end, presence is not under- mined. In the Frankfurt Project, the object is displaced, but not dissimulated. This kind of project does not reject the object. I think in the last seven or eight years decon- struction has been interpreted in architecture as the dissim- ulation of the object. Eisenman, in the early work, Fugi, and some of the Italians like Renato Rizzi have been con- cerned with dissimulation and have produced things very much in the terms you described. I'm thinking particularly of the Fin d'Ou T HouS, which is one of Eisenman's greatest projects, but also, to a lesser extent, Romeo and Juliet. Because in Romeo and Juliet, the dissimulation is so radical, it is often seen as the most authentic interpre- tation of deconstruction in architecture, if there could be such a thing. But the Frankfurt Project marks a change in thinking, because what characterized those previous proj- ects is the attempt to make architecture into a text. They depended on a suspect analogy between objects and words, such that the post-structuralist architect is understood as someone interested in the condition of textuality in ob- jects. We are very familiar with the American interpretation of deconstruction as a theory of literature or literary practice. Of course, in its most rigorous sense, textuality does not imply a written text at all, but almost every theorist uses the word just for its resonances with written writing. Liter- ature, of course, is a basic bourgeois category, and there- fore, in that sense, the politics of deconstruction until this point has been totally one of appropriation in the tradi- tional sense. And here I use language I want to erase very quickly. Because of the way deconstruction has been inter- preted in America, that is, in terms of the literary text, it has been open to the traditional Marxist critique of the appropriation of the radical margins by the center. Clearly, the structure of literary departments did not change as a result of deconstruction. Indeed, even the practice of liter- ary theory did not change. Its presence was not felt as dis- turbing, and so it was disseminated through virtually every department in this country. This has made deconstruction look like a traditional aesthetic, open to orthodox Marxist critiques of the reactionary appropriation of marginal avant-garde work. Furthermore, inasmuch as architects in recent years have attempted to dissimulate the object and make the object a piece of writing, a literary text, something that does not even resemble the object but rather that looks like and should be described as a piece of writing, their work is completely open to appropriation as a traditional art object, isolated from everyday life. Indeed, all of that work has appeared in art galleries, as the subject of recent discus- 54</page><page sequence="5">Wigley sions, and is surrounded in a mystical sea of literary theo- ries of texts, and so on, and most of it is never built, and could not be built, because the interest was, from the be- ginning, in the production of a critical art object. I want to suggest that if one makes an interpretation of deconstruction that does not succumb so easily to the tra- ditional definitions of art, and traditional mechanisms of the discipline of architecture, then a certain political dis- placement will occur. Now, if one's concern is to dissim- ulate the object, then one is adopting a very traditional view of avant-garde art as marginal: art done by extreme radicals at enormous distance from the center, work that always, by definition, is tamed if it is appropriated by the center and placed on the walls of the art gallery. What makes the Frankfurt Project different is that it is not simply involved in a revolutionary aesthetic, like the attempts to dissimulate the object in order to overthrow the classical tradition of architecture. Inasmuch as one attempts to dis- simulate the object from the outside, as you say, then one is not following the rigors of deconstruction, in my view. Deconstruction is not revolutionary. Instead of overthrowing the tradition, it attempts to displace the tradition by identi- fying within it the very properties that the tradition at- tempts to exclude. What is disturbing and unsettling about deconstruction is not that it overthrows the Western tradi- tion, but that it identifies the ways in which the Western tradition is always, in a sense, overthrowing itself, spending all of its time hiding the fact that it is founded on enor- mous dilemmas. Deconstruction is only interesting because these dilemmas do not lead to the downfall of the tradi- tion; rather, they are the source of its strength. I will use an architectural analogy because, for me, it is not an analogy. Theory has always been understood in terms of a certain structure: that it can stand up because there is an unflawed ground. Deconstruction is radical be- cause it says that theoretical structures depend for their strength and solidity on certain fundamental weaknesses. Weaknesses in the foundations. And it is not the solid ground that is the foundation, but rather the cracks and crevices. Therefore, all deconstruction does is to identify these crevices and exploit them playfully. No more than that. It identifies the weaknesses in the realm of structure rather than in the realm of representations added to the structure. A more consistent reading of deconstruction in architecture would have two consequences. We would understand the importance of architecture, and reject the tradition in ar- chitecture that says that architecture is really not so impor- tant, that the object is not so important, and that what counts is the derivation of our theory from other disci- plines, that if one really wants to talk about what's impor- tant in architecture, one must use philosophy, literary theory, and so on, while we ourselves, from our humbled discipline, just manage to scrape into universities, and do so in a very undignified way. One of the two angles it is necessary for me to take is to reject this undignified servil- ity. Because the theoretical tradition is already an architec- tural tradition. To tamper with architecture is already to tamper with the basis of theory. The other angle, the other consequence of this, is that one would no longer be concerned with dissimulating the object. Instead, one would be concerned with a somewhat more basic encounter with the object, the attempt to locate the other within the object. If deconstruction locates the other within the tradition, it says that the tradition operates by virtue of the other, is not dethroned by it, gains its strength from it. Then the question is, What is the realm of the other within the realm of architecture? That, for me, sets up the condition for the kind of archi- tecture whose aesthetic involves the internal subversion of traditional ways of thinking rather than the external subver- sion that is associated with the radical avant-garde of the twenties. And it seems to me that if one is starting to buy into the kind of work that is with the displacement of the tradition, with the disturbance of the tradition from within, then one has entered into a different political realm. And we have. One is not simply committed to the realm of process, of revolution, of coming round the bend. It is the consequence of this argument that one enters into the very heart of architecture, which is to say, its pragmatic condition. This building is thoroughly detailed; working drawings could be done on the basis of the drawings pre- sented here. Which is to say that instead of being a theo- 55</page><page sequence="6">assemblage 5 retical fantasy, it is a real intervention in the realm of building. And this is implicit in terms of its logic, of inter- nal violence rather than external violence. This is not rev- olutionary. The political realm of this kind of project is quite different. And therefore the nature of our analysis must be different. The work defies certain categories that are being set up precisely because the work has a different condition. The traditional leftist analysis of this project as potentially an avant-garde project appropriated by the cen- ter will no longer do. Neither will the typical rightist view of this as an autonomous object. It doesn't succumb to either tradition. There are those who would see this project, being exhib- ited as it is at the Modern, as consistent with the Modern's ideological position. But if it is being appropriated, it is as a Trojan Horse. It invites itself into the Modern. And this is what makes the project disturbing, that it is already doing its work in society. So I don't want to argue that the Frankfurt Project is socially responsible in traditional terms. It is, after all, a building with the most suspect of politics, inasmuch as it is for bioengineers in Germany . . . MH: . .. and is being exhibited by Johnson at MoMA in the States... MW: . . . and, therefore, it plays into the very heartland of all our thinking. It is most disturbing to the traditional leftist political position, but I would argue that it is com- pletely consistent in its approach, which is to occupy and displace the center, but not to overthrow the center, rather to change the status of the center. One could look, for instance, at the recent work of other architects that operates within a more traditional view of the avant-garde and within a much more traditional view of critical architecture as an art form, not necessarily aimed to be built: an art form that operates from the mar- gins rather than the center. John Hejduk's is the finest work of this sort available today; indeed, I think it is the finest work of any sort, anywhere. But its aesthetic, politi- cal, ideological strategy prohibits it from being exhibited at the Modern regardless of what anybody thinks. To display this work at the Modern would be to open it to traditional appropriations, because the work is set up as an object with the idea of undermining the tradition from the margins. But in the belief of the new tradition of deconstruction, it must be said that certain very important relationships exist between the Frankfurt Project and a work such as Hejduk's Berlin Masques. Both interrogate structure. Both celebrate structure. But one celebrates the danger and horror, the internal dilemma of it, and the other celebrates the poetry of structure, which may also be a poetics of horror. Here in this interview, I am making a very, very fine distinction too quickly. But it is on such distinctions that architectural discourse turns. MH: Let me shift the discussion a bit. The Frankfurt Proj- ect will be placed in the MoMA show for which titles have been thrown around that connect it to some notion of con- structivism. There is, of course, a linguistic parallel be- tween constructivism and deconstruction, unfortunate or not. But in the show, projects from the Russian avant- garde will be exhibited alongside the Frankfurt Project. How do you avoid the accusation that the show is simply the institutionalization of the consumption of constructivist images that is already widespread in design culture? MW: The title of the show is Deconstructivist Architecture. Obviously the title has several things to be said about it. It could easily have been Deconstructivism, but it's not a movement that is being discussed, rather a sensibility of sorts. It also clearly has an echo of constructivist; it's ob- viously some critique or reading of constructivism. But also, as clearly, there is an echo of deconstruction. And I think all those echoes should be observed. First, the relationship with the constructivists is not simply aesthetic; it has something to do with the nature of their project. We are certainly not talking about appropriating from sources; this is not a discussion of which of the seven people in the show was most influenced by the constructiv- ists. If the constructivists's work is considered as suggestive of the interrogation of structure, which is then used to un- dermine traditional representation, rather than an attempt to say something with representation, then certain ideologi- cal and theoretical similarities exist between the Frankfurt Project and early constructivism. In the end, as we know, the early Russian investigations of structure developed into 56</page><page sequence="7">Wigley a rhetoric of the machine, of the perfection of the ma- chine, and a concern with the aesthetics of function. The contemporary work involves a displacement of the theory and the aesthetics. These artists who now move from the marginal position to the center are more concerned with the imperfection residing within perfection. I can sort of generalize all these issues. Ironically, all the leftist critics have employed strategies of preemptive retalia- tion, strategies characteristic of Ronald Reagan. In their premature criticism of the show, they have fallen back on the most obvious tradition. It is perfectly clear that the show involves the power of the appropriation of some of the most radical work produced in recent years by the most central figure, Philip Johnson, into the most central insti- tution, the Museum of Modern Art. It is as obvious as the wooden horse was seductive to the Trojans. The horse, which stood outside the gates of Troy, was swallowed up within the architecture of the fortified city; but in the dead of night it proved to be more than problematic. And now this deconstructivist animal is being publicly wheeled up from the Lower East Side through the gates of the Castle Modern. Nothing could be more obvious than that. But don't you think there might be something devious going on as well? The interview was held in Princeton, New Jersey, January 1988. The editors would like to thank Sarah Whiting for her assistance in transcribing the text. 57</page></plain_text>
