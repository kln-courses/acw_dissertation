Fossil animal bones associated with hearths and quartzite tools have been dated by the uranium-tho- rium method, using alpha- and gamma-ray spectrom- etries, to between 204,000 and 295,000 B.P. Natural quartzite material is absent from the cave and can only be found in an outcrop 10 km from the cave. Beltrao considered the possibility that the artifacts might be intrusive, but the clearly discrete strata of the site leave no doubt that the dates and cultural material are as- sociated correctly. She calls for a reconsideration of the traditional 13,000 B.P. date for the first human oc- cupation of the Americas. From May 30 to June 14, 1987, Wesley R. Hurt (Indiana University) supervised an archaeological project cosponsored by the Museu Nacional. This is a continuation of the project directed by Maria Beltrao. Four sites were investigated to shed information on Paleoindian occupations of the general area. The sites are rockshelters and caves in a limestone formation. The first site, Toca de Sao Eusabio, contained little evidence of human occupation other than rock paint- ings on the ceiling. The next site, Toca de Mundinho 2, revealed quartzite tools in levels containing fossil bones of large animals. The presence of unfossilized bones in the same levels as well as evidence of sec- ondary deposition suggested a fortuitous association. Excavation of a nearby site, Toca de Mundinho 3, revealed large numbers of fossilized bones of extinct animals. Associated was a fragment of ground-sloth tooth with a flaked edge suggesting human workman- ship. The deposits of this site, however, largely were destroyed by local laborers excavating a watering tank. Another site contained more definite evidence of bone tools, but, unfortunately, there was no time for exca- vations. On the surface Hurt and his coworkers found a section of a ground-sloth rib that had been flaked, apparently for use as a celt, a fragment showing flaking on one edge, a fragment with a serrated or denticulated edge, and an ovoid bone fragment with three V-shaped cuts. Since these were surface finds, the possibility that these tools were made long after the animals died can not be ruled out. Mato Grosso. The ethnoarchaeological and ar- chaeological project in the Sio Lourenco River basin continued through 1987-1988. Irmhild Wust (Uni- versidade Federal do Goifs) and Karl-Heinz Emmer- ich (University of Frankfurt) worked on the archae- ology, while Renate B. Viertler (Universidade de Sao 185</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Paulo) continued with the ethnographic portion of the project. Financial support comes from FAPES (Fun- dacao de Amparo Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo) and CNPq (Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnol6gico). One hundred twenty-two sites have been investigated to date. Of these, 27 are rock- shelters with petroglyphs, one is an open-air site with petroglyphs, 14 are preceramic open sites, 47 are sites with evidence of Uru tradition pottery, and 33 sites are ethnohistoric and ethnographic Bororo encamp- ments and villages. The preceramic period of the Vermelho River area extends back to at least 2110 ? 65 B.P. (N-5116). Analysis and dating of sediments of human origin in- dicate the beginning of arid conditions by 1720 ? 120 B.P. (NLFB Hannover-14887). This arid phase may have retarded the beginning of a horticultural devel- opment until the ninth century A.D. At the conclusion of the preceramic period, large circular villages up to 280 m in diameter were being built. Some of these consisted of as many as three concentric rings of hab- itation units. Detailed analysis of the distribution of the diverse classes of ceramic artifacts in one of the Uru tradition sites (MT-RN-32) revealed a symmetrical arrangement of six alternating habitations, one showing evidence of manioc processing, while the next did not. This sym- metrical arrangement suggests task specialization and the division of labor among families. Field research continued during 1988 in the middle Sao Lourenco area, with inspection of different envi- ronments to better understand the way in which eco- logical zones were utilized. Special interest will be shown in shifts in the areas utilized by hunter-collector cul- tures after the advent of agriculture. The effects of Cha- co and Tupiguarani influences on the development of more complex agricultural and social systems, and the formation of the ethnographically known Bororo so- ciety, will be the foci of investigations. Pard. In 1983 the Paraense Emilio Goeldi Mu- seum began research in the Carajas region. Financed by the Vale do Rio Doce Company, the project was designed to study and preserve sites threatened by min- ing activities. Mario F. Sim6es directed the research until his death in 1985, when Daniel F. Lopes, Maura Imazio da Silveira, and Marcos Pereira Magalhaes took responsibility. They have carried the fieldwork to com- pletion and analysis is in progress. Preliminary results were reported in 1985 in CURRENT RESEARCH. Of the 53 sites found, 14 are located on the Itacaiunas River, 30 on the Parauapebas (a tributary of the Ita- caiunas), six on the Rio Novo (a tributary of the Par- auapebas), one on the Igarape do Trinta, and two in caves near the top of the Serra Norte. The preceramic Carajas complex has been identified in the two cave sites (Gruta do Gaviao and Gruta do N1) located about 630 m above the rivers. Respective areas of the sites are 255 m2 and 168 m2, and both have an average depth of 40 cm. Artifacts include flakes and crystals of quartz and amethyst, but no projectile points. Abundant charcoal, small- and medium-sized animal bones, tortoise carapaces, shells of river mol- luscs, and fish bones were found within a 8-m2 hearth at a depth of 40 cm. Seven '4C dates place the occu- pation between 8140 ? 130 B.P. (I-14,912) and 2900 ? 90 B.P. (1-14,910). Other caves that show vestiges of this preceramic occupation may be excavated in the future. Analysis will show if this long time span should be divided into phases or if relations exist among pre- viously defined traditions. Fifty-one ceramic sites are located in elevated areas 2.8 to 25 m above the river. The sites are 20 to 1,000 m from existing rivers, and they vary in size from 112 m2 to 40,000 m2. Refuse deposits range in depth from 10 to 80 cm, with the majority about 40 cm deep. Coil- made pottery, tempered with crushed sand and rock, is predominately plain, but decoration includes cor- rugation, red and black paint on white or red slip, incision, finger impression, brushing, scraping, stamp- ing, and polishing. Vessels vary greatly in size, but forms consistently are globular and carinated with plain round bases. Rims are direct, inclined or averted, with or without notches. Funerary urns containing second- ary burials and small offering vessels were found in specialized areas of the sites. Stone scrapers, punches, knives, grinders, hammers, pitted stones for cracking nuts, axes, hoes, flakes, and cores also occur. The most common form of axe is T-shaped. Stone artifacts are primarily of diabase, andesite, granite, gneiss, or quartz. From the pottery it appears that all the sites of the area relate to a single Tupiguarani tradition. The Tauari, Tucurui, and Maraba phases of the lower Tocantins, the Itacaiunas phase of the upper Itacaiinas, and the Carapana phase of the lower Fresco River appear to be related closely, although no historical or ethno- graphic group can be specified at this time. Radiocar- bon dates suggest a first period dated between 1670 and 1560 B.P. (SI-6278 and SI-6275), and a second period dated between 925 and 780 B.P. (SI-6279 and SI-6280). The most recent period dates 530 to 440 B.P. (SI-6276 and SI-6274). Pernainbuco. Jeannette Maria Dias de Lima (Uni- versidade Catolica de Pernambuco), Pedro Ignacio Schmits (Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas), and staff from the Universidade Catolica continued their work at the Furna do Estrago rockshelter site in the munic- ipality of Brejo da Madre de Deus. The small shelter with about 60 m2 of covered area is located in the transitional zone between the wet and dry forests, at an altitude of 650 m on the slope of the Serra da Boa Vista. Abundant material and four 14C dates are re- ported in Diaz de Lima's dissertation (Arqueologia da Furna do Estrago, Brejo da Madre de Deus, Pernam- buco, 1985), but the evolution of the culture is not clear because of the severe disturbance of the site by many intrusive burials of more recent ceramic-making peo- ples. Excavations in less-disturbed areas of the site have established a refined sequence. The lowest Ho- locene beds dated to 11,060 ? 90 B.P. (SI-6298) con- tain hearths, abundant carbon, and small flaked-stone tools that are distinct from those known from nearby sites with similar dates. After a period when the site was not utilized, beds of compact ash dated to 9150 ? 90 B.P. (SI-6297) and 8495 ? 70 B.P. (SI-6296) contain abundant land snails. Artifacts consist of pol- ished axe blades and small flaked-stone tools. A denser population is indicated by the abundant remains. In the transition from this ash bed to a sterile bed, 186 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH there are sporadic occupations of gastropod eaters evi- denced by pits full of snail shells. The following period of abandonment probably corresponds to the alti- thermal when rain waters inundated the cave. Follow- ing this period of abandonment layers of dried leaves alternate with hearths full of small bones of rodents and marsupials. These remains reflect a dry period following the humid altithermal. The final occupation dated to 1040 ? 50 B.P. (SI- 6295) corresponds to a cemetery of a ceramic-using people who must have lived in a nearby village. The small dark ceramic ware does not relate to any pres- ently defined tradition. Remains of no less than 80 individuals have been removed from a space slightly larger than 20 m2. Bodies are flexed, covered with red ocher, and rolled in mats. Necklaces, skin ornaments, heads of various animals, and occasionally weapons and musical instruments are found with the burials. The excellent preservation of the remains will permit future study of soft tissues and parasites. Fifty-nine skeletons that have been analyzed predominately are brachycephalic and are physically distinct from the La- goa Santa man of Central Brazil. With the excavation of other sites of the vast semi- arid region of Brazil, it is hoped that the sequence of climatic and environmental fluctuations will be re- vealed, and changes in population and cultures will be better understood. Sao Paulo. Dorath Pinto Uch6a (Universidade de Sao Paulo [USP], Instituto Pre-Hist6ria) carried out research on the Ilha do Casqueirinho in the munici- pality of Cubatao. Work is supported by a grant from the Companhia Sideruirgica Paulista (COSIPA), the owner of the land where several sambaqui sites and a seventeenth-century lime furnace have been preserved. The lime furnace is like ones that exist today in the Extremadura and Riobatejo regions of Protugal. The research plan calls for a reconstruction of the lifeways of the sambaqui people and a restoration of the original environment of the island. Gisela Yuka Shimizu (USP, Department of Ecology) plans to reconstruct the en- vironment by artificially accelerating the natural succession of plants. There are also plans to consolidate the lime furnace and preserve the historical-period evi- dence. Dorath Pinto Uch6a is also carrying out work in the complex estuary/lagoon area of Canan&amp;ia. Assisting in this project are Gisela Shimizu, Welington B. C. Delitti, Waldir Mantovani, and Yara Schaeffer Novelli (USP). This area of coastal Sio Paulo has one of the greatest concentrations of relatively undisturbed sambaquis in Brazil. Up to 50 percent of these are intact. Radiocar- bon dates from six different sambaquis place the hu- man occupation of the area between 4000 and 5300 B.P. Research on the sambaquis is designed to discover the nature of the subsistence pattern that led to the huge shell deposits. How were different environmental niches exploited? Were the sites occupied seasonally, or were they occupied continuously? Also of interest is the evolution of ecological relations between man and the many different environmental zones that were exploited. Finally, Uch6a reports that an inventory of the ar- chaeological sites of Sao Paulo is being prepared. The survey is designed to aid the federal, state, and mu- nicipal governments in preserving the state's cultural heritage. So far 538 sites, 35 percent of which are coast- al sites, have been recorded. VENEZUELA. Erika Wagner and Lilliam Arvelo (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas) completed a description of an archaeological complex found in the upper Orinoco of Venezuela (Acta Cien- tifica Venezolana 37:689-696). The pottery of the Monou-teri complex is caraipe or ground-rock tem- pered. Rare decoration consists of incision and appli- que. Polished stone axes and griddles suggest that sub- sistence was based at least partially on manioc cultivation. Three '4C dates-500 ? 170 B.P. (IVIC- 574), 1010 ? 70 B.P. (IVIC-573), and 970 ? 70 B.P. (IVIC-575)-have been obtained for the site. The ma- terial culture of the present Yanomama inhabitants of the area shows no relation to the Monou-teri artifacts. Miguel Angel Perera, Kay Tarble, and Josefina Ca- sella (Universidad Central de Venezuela) are conduct- ing research for the Ministerio del Ambiente in the Pijiguaos Region of Bolivar State. Many sites are in imminent danger of being destroyed by a bauxite-min- ing operation, including petroglyphs, rock paintings, and granitic rockshelters. Some of the rockshelters still are used for burial by the indigenous Piaroa, Wanai, and possibly Panare. Initial analysis indicates pro- longed occupation of the caves, with styles pertaining to several different series established for the middle Orinoco Region (Saladoid, Arauquinoid, Valloid, and others). Five habitation sites with surface ceramics classified as Valloid and Arauquinoid were located dur- ing the survey. Maize cultivation can be inferred from abundant fragments of manos, metates, and ground- stone axes. The researchers will look at three types of evidence associated with 16 historical-period cave sites. Samples of painted rock, painted skeletal remains of known age found in rockshelters containing pictographs, and sam- ples of organic-based body paints, prepared by different living ethnic groups, will be compared. Geochemical methods will be used to recognize variations that may be attributable to age differences. Infrared photography will be used to bring out obscure designs and aid in recognizing stylistic variations. Analysis should shed light on the evolution and dispersion of painting styles as well as possible stylistic similarities between pre- hispanic and present-day groups. Future fieldwork will be directed toward recovering data to establish a re- gional chronology, recognize prehistoric population movements, and determine the modes of interaction between island and riverine settlements. Ronald L. Weber ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA In the last year, research has continued to yield ex- citing results, despite declining local support of ar- chaeological research in Peru and Ecuador because of the ongoing economic crisis. Perhaps the most signif- icant factor shaping the archaeological scene in Peru is 187</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the continued threat of violence from guerrilla and narcotics activities in the highlands and ceja de selva, and the consequent concentration of investigations on the coast. The south coast in particular has become a focus of activity and virtually all of the valleys currently are under study. In contrast, in both Ecuador and Bo- livia efforts are underway to expand archaeological re- search into regions that previously have received little attention. The deaths during the last year of Luis Valcarcel, Cirilo Huapaya Manco, and Kazuo Terada buffeted the field. Valcarcel played a major role in shaping the institutional and intellectual framework of archaeolog- ical studies as director of the Museo Nacional de Ar- queologia y Antropologia (MNAA), and in his schol- arly research he strove to integrate insights drawn from archaeology, ethnohistory, and ethnology into a co- herent vision of Peru's past and future. His autobiog- raphy Memorias (1981) will remain a basic source for those interested in the history of archaeological and anthropological research in Peru. Huapaya, who was a disciple of Julio C. Tello, participated in the historic excavations at Pachacamac, Anc6n, and Cajamar- quilla. In the four decades following Tello's death, he continued museological and archaeological activities at the MNAA and the Seminario de Arqueologia del Instituto Riva Aguero (PUC), including important ex- cavations at Huayurco and sites in Piura, Chao, Huaura, and Lima. Terada had been the leader of Japanese archaeolog- ical investigations in Peru for the last 16 years. As one of the key figures in Peruvian archaeology since the First University of Tokyo Scientific Expedition to the Andes in 1959, along with Seiichi Izumi and Toshihiko Sono, Terada shaped a tradition of Peruvianist re- search in his country. Through investigations at Ko- tosh, Garbanzal, Pechiche, La Pampa, and most re- cently, Huacaloma, Terada made a lasting contribution to our understanding of the origins of Peruvian civi- lization. With his sudden death at age 59, the direc- torship of this program passes to a new generation of scholars led by Yoshio Onuki. It should also be noted that the pioneering floral analyst, C. Earle Smith, Jr., was killed in a car accident. Besides his research in Mesoamerica and Colombia, he contributed to our knowledge of plant domestica- tion and early agriculture in the Central Andes through his analysis of the organic remains from Guitarrero Cave and La Galgada. ECUADOR. Investigations at Pirincay in the province of Azuay continued in 1987 with the support of the Museo del Banco Central de Ecuador. Excava- tions, directed by Karen Bruhns (San Francisco State University), revealed a 6 x 11 -m structure dating to the beginning of the second cultural phase (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 200) of the site. The floor was covered with midden and cut by intrusive trash pits. A copper bar and a crucible drop of silver-rich gold came from the midden, and a gilded crescent-shaped nose ornament, bone-weaving implements, and sherd spindle whorls were found in the trash pits. Bruhns links the Pirincay pottery from the upper levels with the Late Narrio phase and Group X ceramics described by Collier and Murra, and that from the lower levels with Early Narr- io, Chaullabamba, Huancaccucho, and Monjashuaycu. cu. These lower levels produced evidence of rock-crys- tal bead workshops and imported artifacts from the coast, adjacent highlands, and tropical forest. The ear- liest remains at Pirincay are related most closely to coastal Chorrera. Sixteen '4C measurements indicate that Pirincay was occupied between approximately 900 B.C. and A.D. 200. George Miller (California State University, Hay- ward) completed the faunal analysis from the first three field seasons at Pirincay (1984-1986). He concluded that prior to ca. 300 B.C., meat consumed at the site primarily consisted of white-tailed deer, with occa- sional rabbits and other wild animals. Remains from a transitional period (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 100) produced evidence of the greatest faunal diversity in the diet, including three species of deer, tapir, bear, caviamorph rodents, and other animals. Bones of camelids domi- nate the Regional Developmental trash deposits in the upper levels of the site and constitute 83 percent of the bone by weight. Miller argues that these animals are a small variety of llama introduced to the Ecuadorian highlands from northern Peru around A.D. 100. Presley Norton (Programa de Antropologia para el Ecuador) reports that the Salango Research Center at Manabi inaugurated its regional museum in 1987. A comparative collection of fish bone, mammal bone, shell, geological samples, and local flora is at the dis- posal of interested scholars. In addition to the ongoing excavations at the Salango site, work began in 1988 further south at Rio Chico and in the Ol6n Valley. Rio Chico is a Valdivia III-IV settlement on a low bluff directly adjoining the beach. It is the only known Val- divia site, besides the type site, on the present shore- line. The Ol1n site is located 2 km inland from the seaside village of that name and it displays a lengthy occupational history from the Engoroy and Guangala cultures to the early Mantenio. As part of a continuing program of archaeological and ethnographic investigations on the Santa Elena Peninsula, sponsored by the Museo Antropol6gico of the Banco Central del Ecuador (Guayaquil) (BCE), Karen E. Stothert (University of Texas at San Antonio) completed a study of an historic tar-processing station. Starting in the early colonial period, Spaniards stopped along the coast of Peru and Ecuador in order to careen their ships and pitch the hulls and rigging with tar made by boiling petroleum from hand-dug pits in the natural oil seeps. Site OGSE-84, located near Santa Paula in a modem oil field, is probably the last of the old tar-boiling sites on the Santa Elena Peninsula. Excavations revealed industrial refuse, including fragments of large tar-boil- ing jars with carbonized petroleum adhering to their interiors, wood charcoal and ash, fragments of fire- reddened adobe bricks, and at least seven adobe struc- tures interpreted as furnaces where the petroleum was refined by boiling in the jars. Each structure had five openings into the interior fire box. Similar furnaces were used in the vicinity of Talara, Peru, in the early eighteenth century. These adobe furnaces were de- scribed for Santa Elena in the late eighteenth century, and they apparently continued in use there through the 188 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH middle of the nineteenth century. By 1917 the adobe furnaces and earthenware vessels were replaced by large metal vats for tar processing. The Tahuin Archaeological Project (BCE), directed by Patricia Netherly, conducted its third field season in 1987. Netherly completed survey and excavation in the reservoir area of the Tahuin Dam on the middle portion of the Rio Arenillas of southeast coastal Ec- uador. Substantial Middle and Late Formative occu- pations have been found, including Late Valdivia, Machililla, and the provisionally designated Arenillas phase, which appears to be a local assemblage contem- porary with Late Machililla and Chorrera. Several ce- ramic styles can be placed in the Regional Develop- mental period; two or three of these appear to have ties with inland groups. The Jambeli style, also known as Garbanzal in Peru, has been documented over 60 km inland from the mangrove littoral zone where it originally was discovered. A burial from El Porvenir, which cross-dates to one of these early Regional De- velopmental styles, contained four copper money axes as well as other copper objects. The fourth field season is focusing on the lower portion of the Arenillas Valley and the adjacent littoral. Patterns of prehistoric settle- ment are being studied in relation to natural water- bodies called pozas, and geographer A. H. Siemens is conducting an independent investigation of the ecology and hydrology of these features. Jonathan Damp continued research at Real Alto from 1984 to 1986, focusing on domestic-activity areas, household structures, and the overall patterning of the village. Patricia Vargas, Pilar Zambrano, and Fabian Villalba assisted with the faunal, malacological, and lithic studies. The excavations at Real Alto have now produced more than 450 seeds or seed fragments from Valdivia I and II contexts (ca. 3500-2300 B.C.). The paleobotanical specimens mainly consist of jack beans and cotton. The recovery of early Valdivia cotton re- mains supports the idea proposed by Stephens and Moseley that cotton originally may have been domes- ticated in this area, where is still grows wild. In 1986 and 1987, Damp, Vargas, Zambrano, and Donald Jackson studied relict beaches on the Guayas coast. Damp tentatively concludes that Real Alto was on the shoreline during the Valdivia occupation, and that sub- sequent uplifting left the site stranded almost 2 km inland. The evidence for this consists of uplifted beach rock and cross-bedded seashore sediments associated with pottery. Damp also completed investigations at Altomayo, a preceramic site that appears to represent a transition between the Vegas phase and Valdivia. His excavations there documented a house structure intermediate in form between Vegas architecture and Valdivia I houses, a small Valdivia-like stone figurine, and worked un- baked clay artifacts. NORTHERN PERU. Peter Kaulicke and K. Ma- kowski of the Universidad Cat6lica (PUC) and Jean Guffroy (ORSTOM, France) initiated collaborative re- search on the far north coast, particularly in the Chul- canas-Morrop6n region of the upper Piura Valley, the adjacent areas of Frias and Ayabaca, and the area be- tween Cerro Vicis and Loma Negra. In 1987, Guffroy conducted survey and excavations at Cerro Nafianique and encountered evidence of an Early Horizon center consisting of rectangular houses with stone foundations and a massive 2.5-m-high platform construction cov- ering .5 ha. The distinctive local culture, named Chul- canas, shows similarities with Ecuadorian cultures like Chorerra and Catamayo and Peruvian cultures like Chavin and Cupisnique. Kaulicke and Makowski discovered the remains of a furnace apparently used for copper production at Pampa Juarez, and scorria and tubes used in metal working at Loma Valverde. They believe that this zone contains evidence of some 1,500 years of metallurgical production beginning with the Vicfs culture and con- tinuing through the Late Horizon. Investigations to the east of Cerro Vicus revealed a large ceremonial com- plex of the Vicis culture, and additional examples of public architecture were found near Cerro Pilan. The Cerro Vicis complex includes a trapezoidal construc- tion composed of four ascending terrace levels with a central ramp. The axis of the site is oriented to the peak of Cerro Vicfis, where an offering of spondylus shell was discovered. Investigators also found an of- fering of crisicola, rock crystal, and intentionally bro- ken pottery, tentatively dated to a late phase of the Vicis culture (A.D. 400-700), on the southeast side of Cerro Vicis. The most spectacular discovery of the year was made in a 1 0-m-high Moche pyramid at Sipan, a site located 35 km east of Chiclayo. Graverobbers encountered a major tomb with abundant gold in the core of the mound, and news of the find led Walter Alva (Museo Briining, Lambayeque) to investigate. He found that they had already pillaged a Moche tomb, the contents of which included gold masks, gold and silver sculp- tures of peanuts, and an elaborate, copper ceremonial scepter. Alva, assisted by Luis Chero and students from the Universidad de Trujillo (UT), subsequently initi- ated excavations in an adjacent undisturbed area and encountered a subterranean chamber containing over 1,000 complete Moche pots. Nearby, they uncovered the burial of a warrior holding a round shield in his left arm, but lacking feet. Beneath this level, Alva dis- covered a sarcophagous ofalgarrobo wood planks bound together with copper wire. Inside it he found the skel- eton of an adult male wearing a gold mask and asso- ciated with three pairs of inlayed-gold ear spools, a copper knife, turquoise-and-gold-beaded bracelets, other ornaments, and spondylus shell. He was dressed in copper sandals and cotton clothing covered with copper platelets, and he held a gold rattle in his right hand. The principal burial was accompanied by the interment of two men, two women, and a dog. Segundo Vasquez (UT) reports on the excavation of Loma Roja, a 6-m-high mound located between the shore and the sunken fields ofChan Chan in the Moche Valley. Loma Roja is interpreted as a fishing village established in the late Middle Horizon and occupied throughout the Late Intermediate period. The principal goal is to clarify the relation between specialized fishing groups and the urban residents of Chan Chan. Exca- vations have revealed layers of fish scale and other specialized activity areas related to the processing of fish for export. A prehispanic road connects Loma Roja 189</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY with Chan Chan. Some 45 km further inland, Claude Chauchat (University of Bordeaux) and Jesus Briceiio (UT) initiated a study of Preceramic workshops and habitation areas. Preliminary investigations have al- ready identified fishtail and Paijan points. David J. Wilson (Southern Methodist University) completed a survey of prehispanic roads, trails, walls, and associated settlements in the intervalley deserts between the Moche and Casma valleys. The 1986- 1987 research documented 400 km of roads and 220 roadside sites. As with the Santa-Chao network studied in 1979 and 1980, most of these roads and sites date to the early Middle Horizon indicating that, at least in terms of intervalley networks, this was probably the time of maximum prehispanic complexity in the Moche-Casma area. However, more limited formal communication routes existed during the Early Hori- zon, when there was an inland route between Moche and Viru; during the Early Intermediate period, when there were routes between Moche, Viri, Chao, and Santa; and during the Late Intermediate period and Late Horizon, when several routes ran the entire dis- tance between Moche and Casma. In addition to the roads and associated sites, three probable ceremonial roads were found in the Chao Valley area; like those of prehispanic Nazca and the modern Bolivian alti- plano, all three are discrete entities that start on pampas and run partway up the sides of adjacent hills, sug- gesting they were associated with mountain worship and ensuring crop fertility. Santiago Uceda (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) be- latedly reports on his studies of the lower Casma Valley carried out in 1983 and 1984. He located approxi- mately 40 sites, including quarries, lithic workshops, shell middens, and other habitation areas. The focus of his analysis was on the Preceramic components and the definition of the Paijanense, Mongoncillo, and late Preceramic lithic complexes. Uceda recovered maize in unambiguous Preceramic contexts in two excava- tions. At the site of El Calvario, located on the south bank near the mouth of the Casma, a maize cob was recovered along with fish bone, cotton, and squash from the fifth of six strata; a radiocarbon measurement from this layer produced a date of 6070 ? 70 B.P. (GIF-6772). At Cerro Negro (or Cerro Julia) near the Panamerican Highway on the north side of the valley, Uceda encountered maize stalks and husks in the third of five strata. Materials associated with the maize yield- ed a 14C date of 6050 ? 70 B.P. (GIF-6773). These radiocarbon measurements suggest that maize has greater antiquity on the Peruvian coast than realized previously. Alexander Grobman examined the maize cob and concluded that it was intermediate between Confite Chavinense and Proto-Confite Morocho. In August, 1987, Shelia and Thomas Pozorski (Pan American University) completed fieldwork on a three- year project studying early state formation in the Cas- ma Valley. Excavations were conducted at three sites- Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, Tortugas, and Huay- nuna. The Pozorskis report that the Initial period site of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, with uncorrected radiocarbon dates ranging between ca. 1800 and 1100 B.C., appears to have been the administrative center of a large polity. The site is 2 km2 in area and is dom- inated by two large mounds, Moxeke and Huaca A, large plazas, and over 80 smaller, intermediate-sized mounds. The Pozorskis believe that Huaca A was a large warehouse whereas the intermediate-sized mounds were probably administrative structures where the elite controlled the flow of goods in and out of the site. Contemporaneous Initial period occupations were in- vestigated at the coastal sites of Tortugas and Huay- nuna, which were likely satellite communities of inland Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. The same two coastal sites also contain late Cotton Preceramic period com- ponents that include abundant midden remains as well as evidence of both domestic and nondomestic archi- tecture. Lisa Wells (National Center for Atmospheric Re- search), Peter Birkeland and Jay Noller (University of Colorado, Boulder [UCB]) are continuing their re- search into the climate and landscape history of the Peruvian coastal plain. Wells is studying the Holocene record of catastrophic flooding by developing a strati- graphic column of overbank sediments. Her previous work concentrated in the Casma and Sechin Valley, but the 1988 work will focus on sediments in the Rios Moche, Chira, and Piura. Birkeland and Noller are studying the record of climate present in the soils of the alluvial plain. In 1987, Noller mainly worked in the regions around San Juan de Marcona and Moque- gua. This year the group also will reexamine the Chira beach-ridge complex in light of the recent sea-level and coastal-progradation history, which Wells developed for the Santa beach-ridge complex. The Rio Abiseo National Park Research Project is an interdisciplinary program dedicated to the study of natural and cultural resources within the context of a recently formed national park in the Departamento de San Martin. Since 1985, investigations have focused on the pdramo and ceja de selva regions on the western border of the park. The archaeology program is di- rected by Thomas Lennon (UCB) and codirected by Miguel Corejo (1985-1987) and Segundo Vasquez (1988). Based on his analysis of ceramics and 14C dates from excavations in Building No. 1 at Gran Pajat&amp;n, Warren Church (UCB) delineated two broad phases of occupation at the site. One of these, the Abiseo phase, is a Late Horizon occupation previously described by Bonavia. The earlier Montecristo phase dates to the late Early Horizon and Early Intermediate period. It displays strong ties with the northern highlands. The ceramic assemblage consists mainly of a local coarse brown ware, but the fine wares apparently are imports from Cajamarca (Initial and Early Cajamarca types) and the Callej6n de Huaylas. The Rio Abiseo program for 1988 is focusing on sites located along the ancient roadway which crosses the pdramo and leads down into the forested Monte- cristo Valley where Gran Pajaten is located. Two rock- shelters at elevations of approximately 3,600 m above sea level will be investigated, as will sites with archi- tecture on the valley floor nearby. Geologists Peter Birkeland and Don Rodbell (UCB) and Susan Short (Institute of Arctic and Alpine Studies) are proceeding with paleoclimatic studies. A basal date of 12,100 ? 190 B.P. (GX-12854) from a sediment column taken at a lake in the paramo, and another of 9,700 ? 270 190 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH B.P. (GX-12853) from a high-elevation bog, provide a minimum age for the deglaciation of this area. During June, July, and August of 1987, William H. Isbell (SUNY-Binghamton) directed archaeological re- search at the Middle Horizon center of Honcopampa, in the Callej6n de Huaylas, assisted by Pablo de la Vera Cruz, Sabino Arroyo, and Hartmut Tschauner. In the 1987 investigations, three building forms were identified. Chullpas range from small, single-floored examples to two and possibly three floor specimens with basal diameters as great as 12 x 15 m. Patio groups consist of a square or rectangular perimeter wall enclosing a central patio. Elongated rooms surround the central patio. D-shaped buildings are like circular buildings except that they have a flat side. One D-shaped building has a door in the center of the flat side. Three radiocarbon dates were associated with floors and/or refuse above the floors of patio groups. They are A.D. 710 + 90, A.D. 570 + 70, and A.D. 670 ? 70. The fourth charcoal sample came from foun- dation fill at the base of a patio group and yielded A.D. 620 ? 100. These measurements are consistent with a Middle Horizon dating of the site. Patio groups and D-shaped buildings are known at Huari, but they seem to lack antecedents in the Callej6n de Huaylas. Ceramics include what appears to be an early com- ponent in which white-on-red and resist-decorated specimens occur, a middle component in which pol- ished blackware and redware appear, and a late com- ponent with stamped or applique and incised pottery decoration. The middle component appears to be as- sociated with occasional Huari sherds as well as local pottery that imitates Huari ceramics, especially the Vifiaque style. While Huari building forms predominate at Hon- copampa, the distinctive features of the masonry show that the buildings were constructed by local workers. Isbell hypothesizes a system of indirect Huari rule at Honcopampa developed early in the expansion of the Huari state. CENTRAL PERU. Jorge Silva (University of Michigan [UM], University of San Marcos [USM]) continued his survey of the Chill6n Valley, assisted by Dawn Massic (UM) and Dante Casareto (USM). In the 1987 field season they recorded more than 300 sites. Late Intermediate period sites are frequent on the val- ley floor in the form of mound clusters and effigy mounds. The large number of late settlements requires revision of earlier views on Late Intermediate period settlement patterns in Chill6n. Two types of formative public architecture were encountered in the chaupi- yunga: pyramid complexes with a U-shaped layout and terraced pyramid mounds. In 1988, Silva will focus the survey on the upper section of the Chill6n. Charles Hastings (Central Michigan University) is extending his systematic survey of the eastern slopes of Junin into the Chanchamayo area. Daniel Morales (Seminario de Historia Rural An- dina, USM) recently completed a study of prehistoric terraces in the middle portion of the Rimac Valley. In his survey, he registered 52 sites and documented large expanses of abandoned terracing between 500 m and 1,200 m above sea level. Judging from associated ce- ramics, these agricultural features were only utilized during the late Early Horizon and the early part of the Early Intermediate period. Morales argues that their continued use was prevented by the increasing aridity of the zone. The Yale University Lurin Valley Project, directed by Richard Burger (Yale University) and Lucy Salazar- Burger (USM), carried out the second season of ex- cavations at the late Initial period site of Cardal. With the assistance of archaeologists Jose Pinilla and Alfredo Carbajal, and archaeology students from San Marcos and Yale, excavations were conducted in four sectors of the site over a five-month period. In the central portion of the main pyramid, excavations revealed that access to the summit complex was by way of a steep 34-step white-clay staircase. With the help of conserva- tors Giacomo Chiari (University of Torino) and Victor Chang, the project unearthed a polychrome clay frieze of a mouth band with interlocking triangular teeth and large canines that once decorated the open antecham- ber facing out onto the plaza. A doorway leads from the antechamber into an undecorated, rectangular chamber similar in design to the atrium of the Templo Medio at Garagay. After a major renovation, in which a new staircase was built, the atrium and antechamber were buried intentionally and a similar architectural complex and associated staircase were built directly above them. A radiocarbon measurement of 2790 ? 90 B.P. (1-14249) from a shicra bag dates this instance of ritual entombment. Immediately prior to the new construction, the summit atrium was utilized as a cem- etery for some twenty men, women, and children who were buried face down in a flexed position in irregular pits with few grave goods. The human osteological remains are currently being analyzed by Joe Vraden- burg (University of Missouri). A second area of investigation was on the summit near the juncture of the central mound and the eastern lateral wing. This work brought to light an elaborate building with two symmetrically placed, stepped fea- tures interpreted as altars. Other excavations, designed to elucidate the layout of the ceremonial architecture, revealed the existence of large, rectangular causewayed enclosures to the north of the U-shaped-platform com- plex and a ritual road, flanked by circular platforms and sunken circular plazas, that runs along the central axis of the site. Finally, new excavations to the south of the central pyramid uncovered a household area consisting of a rectangular four-room building, an open cooking area, and a set of small chambers interpreted as storage units. Ponciano Paredes (INC), assisted by R6gulo Franco (INC), excavated and consolidated portions of the Templo Viejo at Pachacamac. According to their study, construction at the Templo Viejo began with the build- ing of a fieldstone platform on a base of prepared clay. This building subsequently was covered by a larger platform of small adobes by peoples of the Lima cul- ture. According to Paredes, the earliest adobe construc- tion was painted yellow, while subsequent renovations (ca. A.D. 400) were painted white, and still later re- modeling utilized polychrome painting in red, black, yellow, and white. Work in the patio of the Templo Viejo uncovered the remains of gallinazo (buzzard) 191</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY feathers and fish, confirming that these birds were fed ritually from the top of the pyramid. Paredes discov- ered caches of offerings including small stone repre- sentations of maize cobs, golden figurines dressed in miniature cloth garments, and a perfectly preserved polychrome Inca shirt on the looted summit of the Palacio Pintado, next to the Templo Viejo. Joyce Marcus (UM) reports that she has received the results of the thin-section analysis for pottery from Cerro Azul, Cafiete Valley. James Stoltman (Univer- sity of Wisconsin), utilizing a new technique for the quantitative analysis of ceramic thin sections through petrography, notes that all Cerro Azul wares were made from fine clays that contained no more than 10 percent silt and 5 percent sand, to which crushed, fine-grained igneous rock was added as temper. In assessing all the pottery types, Stoltman discovered that, in terms of temper, the standard Camacho Black has the greatest amount, while the highly polished variant of Camacho Black has the least. In terms of temper size, the highly burnished variant of Camacho Black, primarily used for burial vessels, had the smallest grains, while the Camacho Reddish-brown, used in huge jars for chicha storage/production, had the largest. Bruce Owen (University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA]), working with the Upper Mantaro Archaeo- logical Research Project, is investigating the organi- zation of metal production, exchange, and use during the Late Intermediate period, Late Horizon, and early Colonial period. He is conducting metal-detector sur- veys and excavations in residential and public areas of Wanka habitation and administrative sites, checking mines and adjacent areas for evidence of prehistoric use, and collecting ore, slag, and metal samples for chemical and isotopic-sourcing studies. SOUTHERN PERU. Martha Anders (University of Calgary) began work at Maymi, a site in the lower Pisco Valley first studied by Ann Peters (Cornell Uni- versity) in 1985. Maymi was occupied from the late Early Horizon to the Late Intermediate period, but the major cultural component dates to the Middle Hori- zon. Excavations by Anders uncovered an adobe en- closure containing five offering deposits of fine pottery which show a stylistic mix of what traditionally would be classified as Epoch 1B and Epoch 2 materials. While many vessels show similarities to the Robles Moqo, Pacheco, Chikipampa, Nasca 9, and Vinaque styles, there are also forms and techniques of decoration new to the Wari repertoire. Some of this pottery may have been manufactured at Maymi since there is a heavy concentration of pottery-making implements, as well as misfired and broken pottery. Investigations also re- vealed buildings of low, double-faced adobe walls, which may have supported cane-and-mud superstructures. Some of these buildings have white chalk floors and are associated with Wari and late Nasca pottery. Subfloor offerings contained balls of cotton thread nes- tled in raw cotton, small unbaked clay figurines wrapped in raw cotton, cotton cloth, and blue wool, and a basket filled with corn cobs wrapped in cotton cloth. Archaeological research at Ciudad Perdida de Hua- yuri, Paredones, and a series of other sites in the De- partamento de Ica have been initiated under the di- rection of Miguel Pazos (Museo Regional de Ica) as the result of an agreement between CORDEICA and the INC. Ciudad Perdida de Huayuri in the Santa Cruz Valley, Palpa Province, is an extensive urban complex covering the terraced valley floor and slopes. It consists of a multitude of small rectangular rooms adjoining lateral or central patios. These presumed household clusters are connected by a network of streets and or- ganized into at least 12 larger units, which may cor- respond to neighborhoods or activity zones. Large quantities of refuse, including Paroma-style pottery, are present and Pazos dates the site to the Late Inter- mediate period. Urban centers similar to Ciudad Per- dida de Huayuri were identified at Pinchango, San Juan, Cerro, and Los Colorados in the Rio Grande drainage of Nasca, but coeval sites in Ica, Pisco, and Chincha display very different patterns of urban planning. Fernando Herrera (INC) supervised the investiga- tions at the Inca administrative center of Paredones, Provincia de Nasca, with the objective of elucidating the layout, building technique, and activities of the different sectors of the site, as well as conserving it and making it accessible to the public. Excavations revealed walls of dressed stone similar to those known from Pachacamac, defining a plaza area 18 x 24 m. The southern patio wall is decorated with large trepezoidal niches. Herrera reports that most buildings consist of adobe walls with bases of roughly worked stone. The Italian Archaeological Mission, directed by Giu- seppe Orefici (Centro Italiano Studi e Ricerche Ar- cheologiche Precolombiane de Brescia), continued re- search at the monumental site of Cahuachi, Nasca. Orefici reports the discovery of a well-preserved tran- sitional Paracas-Nasca temple 70 m on a side, which is decorated with a clay frieze of a step motif. This construction intentionally was buried to build a later Nasca temple. Augusto Belan (Universidad Cat6lica Santa Maria) reports that during his research in the Acari Valley with Fritz Riddel (California Institute for Peruvian In- vestigations), 96 sites were registered. In 1987 and 1988, excavations at San Francisco de Yauca and Tambo Viejo in the Province of Caraveli attempted to salvage information from these badly damaged cemeteries. The Tambo Viejo cemetery first was used during Nasca 6/7 and then reutilized during the late Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate period. Belan encountered abundant "Late Acari" ceramics and documented nu- merous burial practices, such as the interment of neo- nates in pots with guinea pigs and birds. Richer adult tombs yielded spondylus-shell necklaces, metal pins, bags of coca and lime, and sling shots. James B. Richardson III (Carnegie Museum) and Daniel Sandweiss (Cornell University) directed the third season of fieldwork at the Ring site near Ilo. The lowest levels of this shell midden yielded a 14C measurement of 10,575 ? 105 B.P. (SI-6783) and a date of 7675 ? 60 B.P. (SI-6930) for one of the intermediate levels. The 1987 investigations consisted of excavating three small pits through the roughly 2 m of undisturbed de- posit. The artifact assemblage is characterized by a flake and cobble industry; no points have been found. Analysis of faunal remains from the 1985 season by Elizabeth Reitz (University of Georgia) documents an 192 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH almost exclusively marine-oriented diet of fish, sea birds, and sea mammals, as well as molluscs. The Moquegua Bodegas Project, directed by Pru- dence Rice (University of Florida), is an investigation of the ruins of Spanish Colonial wineries (bodegas) in the Moquegua valley. The project began with the aim of recording the locations of bodega ruins and inven- torying the large earthenware jars (tinajas) used for fermentation and storage. In 1985 and 1986, 130 bode- gas were identified in the narrow, 28-km-long valley. Sites often have both residential and "industrial" areas, the latter characterized by facilities associated with wine and brandy making, including stone-lined crushing tanks, large rooms housing rows of tinajas, distillery apparatus, and large kilns presumably used to fire the tinajas. Estimated to hold 400-450 gallons of liquid, the tinajas have dates and names of saints and places inscribed on their shoulders. Dates range from 1590 to 1853, with approximately 60 percent of them falling in the last half of the eighteenth century. During the 1987 season, 27 of the better-preserved bodegas were sampled to identify sixteenth-century re- mains, and 30 sites were mapped. The Locumbilla bodega was selected for further investigation on the basis of shovel-test pits and documents reporting its existence by 1605. Rice found a buried kiln and a burned feature with a radiocarbon date calibrated to A.D. 1630 ? 60. BOLIVIA. The Proyecto Wila Jawira, organized in conjunction with the Instituto Nacional de Arqueo- logia (INAR) of Bolivia and directed by Alan Kolata (University of Chicago) and Oswaldo Rivera (INAR), concentrated in 1987 on the sites of Lukurmata, Paj- chiri, and Khonko Wankane in the hinterland of Ti- wanaku. Marc Bermann (University of Michigan) con- tinued broad horizontal excavations of Tiwanaku houses and residential clusters in an area adjacent to Lukurmata's semisubterranean temple. He uncovered a complex series of superimposed houses and patios dating from Pre-Tiwanaku through the Tiwanaku IV periods, as well as numerous Tiwanaku V phase slab- lined cist tombs that intruded into the earlier residen- tial clusters. Of special significance are multiple, strati- graphically distinct house clusters that date to the Tiwanaku III phase. These house clusters have per- mitted a preliminary refinement of the Tiwanaku III period into four subphases. Faunal and artifact anal- yses suggest a reorientation of the local domestic econ- omy, between the Tiwanaku II and Tiwanaku IV phas- es, from an emphasis on lacustrine resources to primary reliance on the processing and consumption of agri- cultural products. At the same site, Enrique Soruco (INAR) excavated three deep trenches along the exterior of the semisub- terranean temple to define the nature and sequence of construction. Outer masonry retaining walls and layers of artificially laid, colored clay, stone, and earth were documented. Dedicatory offerings of puma and llama incensarios suggest a Tiwanaku IV date for primary use of the Temple. Robert Coffman (University of Pennsylvania) expanded earlier excavations of resi- dential-terrace occupations at Lukurmata. The new ex- cavations revealed an elite domestic occupation of the terraced hillslopes, in the southern sector of the site dating to the Tiwanaku IV phase, that included diverse house forms, staircases, and subterranean drainage ca- nals. Howard Earnest (USDA Forest Service), John Janusek (UC), and Jose Estevez (INAR) continued ex- ploring a massive (ca. 80 x 100-m) artificial platform mound in the eastern sector of the site. Preliminary results indicate that this platform was built prior to the Tiwanaku IV period and may be Pre-Tiwanaku in date. A series of Tiwanaku IV and V phase house founda- tions, elite burials, and midden deposits cut into the platform mound. Karen Wise (Northwestern University) directed stu- dents from the University of San Andres (La Paz) in the excavation of Post-Tiwanaku architecture in the northern sector of Lukurmata. She encountered de- posits associated with the Tiwanaku, Post-Tiwanaku (Pacajes), Inca, and colonial periods. Two circular houses of Post-Tiwanaku and local Inca affiliations were excavated completely and found to be associated with fish processing. These results suggest the possi- bility of occupationally specialized fishing communi- ties at Lukurmata during the Post-Tiwanaku period, and perhaps as early as the Tiwanaku occupation. Chip Stanish (Field Museum) and Mario Loza (INAR) com- pleted mapping of Lukurmata, including all surface architecture related to the Post-Tiwanaku period. Kolata, Charles Ortloff(FMC Corporation), and Leo Ticcla (INAR) concentrated on mapping and excavat- ing an interconnected spring-channelized quebrada aqueduct system at Lukurmata, and also on mapping a massive Tiwanaku-affiliated reservoir and aqueduct system at Pajchiri. Grey Graffam (University of To- ronto) conducted survey and test excavations of raised field systems, in the Pampa Koani zone, and of aque- ducts in the vicinity of Chiripa. Preliminary results suggest continuation of raised-field agriculture in some districts into the Post-Tiwanaku period. Michael Bin- ford (Harvard University), Mark Brenner (Florida State Museum), and Barbara Leyden (University of South Florida) continued a program of lake-sediment coring and paleolimnological research that is documenting lake-level fluctuations and changes in vegetation, mi- crofossil deposition, and rates of mineral and nutrient transport from terrestrial to aquatic environments over a 3,500-year period in the near-shore environments of Pajchiri and Lukurmata. Ann Helsley (University of Texas) and Mario Loza completed a topographic map of Khonko Wankane, a site with stone sculptures described by Max Portugal. Small excavations at Khonko revealed well-preserved ceremonial architecture, including a painted staircase, as well as domestic architecture and midden deposits to a depth of over 2 m. Finally, a program of experimental raised-field cul- tivation in the communities of Lakaya, Quiripujo, Chukara, and Korila was organized in conjunction with the Unidad Academica Campesina de la Universidad Cat6lica Boliviana. Jorge Guzman reports that the ex- perimental raised field survived a severe frost that af- fected the Bolivian altiplano in February, and that as of April, 1988, potato yields on demonstration plots ranged between 17 and 38 metric tons/hectare, a figure 193</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY which corroborates the previously reported yields ob- tained by Erickson and Garaycochea for the Huatta district of Puno, Peru. Richard L. Burger SOUTHERN CONE As new assistant editor of this area, I solicited annual reports through a mass mailing. The response from colleagues was surprisingly and pleasantly overwhelm- ing. I received more than 200 typed pages in Spanish to edit and translate. Obviously, not all of these can be published, so I decided to reduce a large majority of the lengthy reports to brief statements. As a result, it is likely that I have omitted or altered some findings and interpretations. I apologize if I have made any serious errors or omissions. In order to prevent any errors or omissions on my part in the future I advise colleagues to limit the length of their reports to one double-spaced, type-written page. Unfortunately, the reports of several colleagues arrived too late for inclu- sion in this issue. They will be published in the next report on the Southern Cone. Lastly, I stated in my letter to colleagues that I would write an introductory statement on the archaeology of the Southern Cone. In order to publish as many reports as possible this time, I decided to wait until the next issue to write a commentary. BOLIVIA. Cochabamba. David Pereira, Ramon Sanzetenea, Maria de los Angeles Mufioz (Universidad Mayor de San Simon), and Donald Brockington (Uni- versity of North Carolina) continued their investiga- tion of the Formative period in the Cochabamba region by returning to Conchu Pata, Mizque, in 1987 to ex- cavate a burial site threatened by agricultural devel- opment. They recovered 40 intact burials accompanied by 5 stone axes, 4 stone and 23 ceramic vessels, marine and lacustrine shells, and over 350 beads of bone, shell, coral, sodalite, and aquamarine. Burials almost always were extended and supine, with the head to the south. Three '4C measurements on human bone date the buri- als between 1100 and 700 B.C. The shells suggest con- tact with the Pacific coast and perhaps Lake Titicaca, while some ceramics share specific similarities with materials from the Cochabamba Valley, northwest Ar- gentina, and southern Peru. While the ceramics are part of the generally undecorated monochrome Formative tradition widespread in the South Andes, their forms usually are particular to the Mizque region. The vessels do not represent the earliest segment of the ceramic sequence established for the Mizque area, following stratigraphic excavations in 1986 with the financial support of the National Geographic Society. In 1988, the group plans to do archaeological reconnaissance and testing throughout the almost unknown southern part of the Department of Cochabamba, giving em- phasis to the Formative period. The long-range pur- pose is to interrelate the diverse Formative ceramic traditions of the South Andes while investigating vil- lage to state evolution in Cochabamba. ARGENTINA. Northwest. An interdisciplinary re- search team, headed by Alberto Rex Gonzalez of the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tec- nicas (CONICET) and the Museo de Historia Natural, La Plata (MHNLP), is investigating the Formative pe- riod in northwest Argentina. As a member of the team, Ines Graciela Gordillo of the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) is analyzing the external contact and cul- tural continuity of the Aguada Complex in the Ambato Valley of Catamarca. Since 1977, she has concentrated on the La Rinconada site, a planned ceremonial center laid out in a U-shaped form opening to the west. As- sociated with the center are an artificial mound and several large architectural compounds. Gordillo and her colleagues believe that this site periodically func- tioned as a center of religious and social activity and that it was supported by a dense outlying population. Excavation at the site has also revealed the use of a hallucinogenic plant (Anadenanthera colubrina). The utilization and effect of this plant are under study by Gordillo and J. A. Perez. Two radiometric measures date the site around 2520 ? 40 B.P. (H-7005/6599) and 2640 ? 40 B.P. (H-7004/6598). The age and com- plexity of La Rinconada suggest that the Aguada cul- ture has its roots in the Ambato Valley. Iconographic research by Gordillo and Maria F. Kusch on the feline and other motifs suggests that Aguada symbolism has its roots in the same area. Maria Florencia Kusch (CONICET) notes that she is classifying the stylistic variation and context of the feline motif in Aguada iconography at sites in the Schaquis area (La Rioja) Also in the Northwest Formative period, Hilda Bea- triz Garrido de Biazzo and Ana Nelida Baraza de Fonts (Universidad Nacional De Tucuman [UNT]) have been studying the relation between feline iconography and drug use from ecological, social, artistic, and philo- sophical perspectives. Special attention is given to the religious, sociopolitical, and military organization of the Aguada and Condorhuasi-Alamito cultures. These investigators seek contact and correspondence with scholars working on similar problems in other areas of the Americas. Under the direction of Carlos A. Aschero (CONI- CET), work on the "Proyecto Sistemas de Asenta- mientos Cazadores-Recolectores en la Puna Argen- tina" continued in 1987 at several sites in the Quebrada Seca in the Catamarca region. Aschero located lithic campsites, lithic workshops on hilltops, stone parapets on hilltops or in arroyos, basalt quarries, a rockshelter, and two caves with rock paintings. The objective is to identify and define resource complementarity and lith- ic technology through time at Quebrada Seca 3. Pre- liminary excavation at the rockshelter has revealed at least 17 preceramic occupational levels and deeper, unexcavated cultural strata below. Two '4C dates were processed at 4930 ? 110 B.P. (AC-1115) and 8670 + 350 B.P. (AC-1118). Abundant floral and faunal data suggest use of the site mainly during the summer months. An analysis of the rock painting, in conjunc- tion with M. Podesta (CONICET), suggests a temporal affiliation with Inca Cueva 4 in the Jujuy region around 8600-7200 B.C. As part of Carlos Aschero's project, Elizabeth Pintar (CONICET) is investigating the settlement pattern and 194 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH lithic technology of hunter-gatherers in the upper Rio Las Pitas Valley in the Catamarca region. She is com- paring the reduction stages of stone tools and the use and variety of raw lithic material from several sites with those in the regional type collection from Que- brada Seca 3. Pintar also has studied site-formation processes, focusing on the effects of human and animal trampling on the form and distribution of lithics lying on sandy use surfaces. Another member of the Aschero team is Lidia Clara Garcia (UBA, CONICET), who has initiated excava- tion at several cave and rockshelter sites of the For- mative period near Inca Cueva. Work at Alero I has produced preceramic and ceramic occupations, with a radiocarbon date of 2900 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-25116) on charcoal from an early ceramic level. Other sites pro- duced both preceramic and ceramic materials, but no radiometric dates are available. Garcia also joined the French archaeological mission, directed by Danielle Lavalle, at Sierra del Aquilor. Two brief field seasons have obtained evidence of long occupational sequences at several rockshelters. Also associated with Aschero's project is Dolores C. Elkin (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia [INA], CONICET), who is studying the faunal remains re- covered from Quebrada Seca 3. Camelidae bones are common in the collection. Future faunal work is planned at other sites as part of a general study of hunter- gatherer economy in the region. M. Mercedes Podesta (UBA) is investigating Pre- ceramic and Formative rock painting in the Catamarca region. X-ray diffraction of paint pigments from three preceramic sites in Quebrada Seca reveals possible af- finities. Formative sites (after 1000 B.C.) show artistic affiliation with the Ci6nega and Aguada cultures. Myriam Noemi Tarrag6 (UBA, CONICET) is head- ing a research team studying the Regional Develop- mental and Inca periods in the Santa Maria Valley (Catamarca). At present, the interaction between pre- hispanic ethnic groups of the Yocavil Valley and the Inca and Spanish is underway. Aerial photography and systematic reconnaissance have located more than 80 prehispanic and hispanic sites. The area of Rinc6n Chi- co, situated west of the modern city of Santa Maria, has been selected for more extensive work. At least 19 architectural sites have been located in the area, and more exist in the direction of Chafiar Punco-Fama- tanca. Preliminary results of this survey provide a basic understanding of the local settlement pattern and site hierarchy. Stratigraphic excavation in domestic de- posits has yielded valuable data on local chronological sequences, diagnostic cultural features, and the types and levels of technology. Tarrag6 is working with Maria Beatriz Cremonte, Maria Esther Albeck, and several professors and stu- dents from the Universidad de Jujuy and the Univer- sidad de Buenos Aires in studying the late prehispanic and early hispanic periods in the Quebrada de Hu- mahuaca (Jujuy). A major transect was surveyed from Angosto de Perchel to Horillos in the highlands. Also working with Tarrag6 is Maria Christina Scat- tolin (UBA) who began research at several Formative sites on the western flanks of Sierra del Aconquija in the Catamarca region. She is interested in human re- source utilization and the development of village ag- riculture, especially in relation to water sources and high altitude lands. Excavation has been carried out at the Loma Alta site in Santa Maria. The recovery of grinding stones, storage facilities, and camelid bones attests to a primary agricultural economy supported by hunting and pastoralism. Ceramic data reveal two dif- ferent Formative occupations, one lasting from about A.D. 1 to 400 and the other from A.D. 400 to 600, both characterized by distinct settlement patterns. The earlier pattern reflects a decentralized, self-sufficient system; the later one shows a centralized settlement hierarchy, headed by the large Buey Muerto site. Maria Beatriz Cremonte (UBA) is involved in sev- eral projects. She is completing her study of materials excavated from several Formative villages of the Tafi culture in the Quebrada de La Cienega in the Tucuman region. She is also collaborating with Nora Flegenhei- mer, R. Pla, and A. Gordon in a neutron activation study of ceramics and clay from various sites in the Cienega and Tafi valleys. They will determine the type and locality of raw material used in pottery manufac- ture and the affinal relations between regional sites. This work, coupled with technological analysis of ce- ramics recovered from several sites in northwest Ar- gentina, will provide new chronological and cultural data on interregional pottery traditions. The Instituto de Arqueologia of the UNT, under the direction of Victor A. Nfiez Regueiro, is involved in a long-term study of the diacronic relations between lowland and highland groups in northwest Argentina, and of the role of different resource zones in this in- teraction. He reports that the earliest manifestation of this interaction took place between the Condorhuasi- Alamito and Cienega cultures in the Catamarca region and between the Tafi and Candelaria cultures in the Tucuman region during the early Formative period (600 B.C.-A.D. 500). The spread of corn and bean agriculture, burial urns, and other traits into the lower Andean mountains is attributed to the Candelaria and Ci&amp;naga cultures of the tropical eastern piedmont and plains. The Tafi and Condorhuasi cultures, originally from the Bolivian altiplano, introduced tuber culti- vation, pastoralism, metallurgy, and religious archi- tecture to the area sometime between A.D. 200-450. These two cultures gave birth to Aguada (A.D. 500- 850), the first culture to integrate highland and lowland traits. The Aguada culture spread from the intermon- tane valleys to the lowlands. Nifiez Regueiro and his colleagues also see the late Santamariana culture (A.D. 900-1000) in the lowlands developing out of the Aguada culture. While he attributes much of the development of and interaction between these cultures to sociocul- tural processes, he also sees paleoclimatic and envi- ronmental change as having played an important role in the nature of relations between local populations. Several archaeologists from various institutions are in- volved in this research, including Marta R. A. Tartusi (UNT). Adriana Callegari (UBA) directed a settlement and subsistence study of the Vinchina (or Bermejo) Valley in the Rio Rioja area. Preliminary results have estab- lished that a mosaic environmental pattern character- ized by arid shrub vegetation was present and that 195</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY sedentary groups developed in the late Formative pe- riod (A.D. 600-900) and Regional Developmental pe- riod (A.D. 900-1492). Additional work in the Hermosa Valley and Villa Castelli has located numerous pre- hispanic architectural sites. In 1989, Callegari plans to concentrate on data obtained from a random, proba- bilistic sampling of ceramics collected at surveyed sites, the formulation of a ceramic typology, and the analysis of material excavated at the Las Parecitas and El Car- men sites. Since 1986, Milena Calderari (UBA, CONICET) has been investigating museum collections recovered from the Puerta de la Paya site in the Calchiqui Valley. The main focus of her study is a local ceramic chronology, particularly concerned with Inca mitimae occupation. In the northernmost sector of the Quebrada de Hua- mahuaca in Jujuy, Maria Isabel Hernandez Llosas (CONICET, Instituto De Antropologia e Historia HispanoAmericano) studied the relation between land- use patterns and stylistic variations at Alero de las Circumferencias and six other rockshelters. Emphasis is given to the study of ceramics, rock painting, and mobile art objects (e.g., ceramics, textiles). Her prelim- inary study shows that stylistic variability relates to ethnic identity, settlement and subsistence pattern, community form, and social interaction. Lidia Baldini (MHNLP, CONICET) is continuing work on the socioeconomic development of late For- mative and Regional Developmental period (A.D. 700- 1480) communities in the central Calchaqui Valley of the Salta region. She has focused on Molinos I, a nu- cleated village defined by subrectangular houses, ag- ricultural zones, and specialized workshops. The in- habitants of the site practiced a mixed agricultural, hunting, plant-collecting, and pastoral economy. Ce- ramics relate to the Calchaqui, Santa Maria, Hualfin, and Abaucan valleys. Three radiocarbon dates, 870 ? 90 B.P. (AC-0450), 1040 ? 110 B.P. (AC-0451), and 1160 ? 100 B.P. (AC-0452), place the site in the For- mative to Regional Developmental transitional period. Additional work has been carried out by Alicia A. Fernmndez Distel of the Centro Argentino de Etnografia Americana (CAEA) on the history of corn in northwest Argentina. She reports a date for corn of 10,550 ? 300 B.P. (GAK-13402) from the Le6n Huasi I site. The associated cob has 33 grains, as identified by J. Camara Hernandez, and is believed to be derived from the lowlands to the east. Fernandez also notes that corn was found in the deeper levels of the Huachichoana III site that date in the eleventh millenium B.P. Corn remains from several sites in the Susques area, which date around 400 ? 100 B.P. (LP-169), also are being studied. Fernandez also reports that the earliest ceramics in the South Andes are associated with incipient agricul- tural development in the tropical lowlands. Two ad- ditional radiocarbon dates, 3460 ? 110 B.P. (GAK- 9772) and 2365 + 95 (SI-6957), are available on early incised ceramics, painted incised ceramics, and mod- eled ceramics from various sites in the region. Jorge Fernandez (INA) is directing a stable isotope study of archaeological, ethnographic, zoological, and paleontological materials from several areas in the Ju- juy highlands. To date, 180 isotopic values have been obtained from modern human and camelid blood sam- ples; 13C isotopic values have been taken from various plant species for comparison with fractions derived from the archaeological bone collagen of animal species. Fernandez seeks to obtain data on paleotemperature curves and paleohydrological changes from the 180 val- ues, establish differential ratios between wild and do- mesticated camelids, and examine dietary and eco- nomic changes through time, including those related to the domestication and consumption of '80-type plants (i.e., corn) by human populations. Parana-Pampa. M6nica Salemme (MHNLP) sends new information on her zooarchaeological study offau- nal collections from several sites on the Pampa. Pre- liminary results show that guanaco (Laina guanicoe) and deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) were exploited heavily by indigenous groups since late Pleistocene times. Al- though these animals were present in the region for several millennia, they had disappeared in the eastern Pampa by the time of Spanish arrival in the sixteenth century. Deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), nutria (Mvo- castor coypus), and other animals of the warmer, wet- ter habitats of southern Brazil migrated into the area during late prehispanic times, replacing the local fauna and forcing indigenous groups to readapt their econ- omy to these new species. In 1987, Alicia Noemi Kurc (CONICET) initiated a salvage archaeological project in the planned Parana Medio Reservoir in Santa Fe. After conducting a lit- erature search, she located 24 new sites in a 700-km2 zone of the reservoir. M6nica A. Beron (CONICET, UBA) has been study- ing prehispanic and hispanic human population and demography in relation to water routes in the Pampa. Based on the archaeological work of Carlos J. Gradin and others, she postulates that the earliest human mi- gration occurred along the Atuel, Salado, and Chadi- leuvi-Curac6 rivers, which are the primary water courses crossing the desert. Historical, geomorphologi- cal, and archaeological data are being examined to bet- ter understand water-use rights and conflicts during the historic period. In continuing work started under the guidance of Augusto Cardich, Nora Flegenheimer (CONICET) ex- cavated, in collaboration with the Museo de Historia y Ciencias Naturales in Loberia, at Cerro La China and Cerro El Sombrero in the Tandilia hills south of Buenos Aires. Fish-tail projectile points were recovered from both sites. The oldest levels at Cerro La China are dated at 10.720 ? 150 B.P. (1-12741), 10,790 ? 120B.P.(AA- 1327), and 10,610 ? 180 B.P. (AA-1328). Recent work at Cerro El Sombrero yielded cultural material very similar to that at Cerro La China; no radiometric mea- sures are available for the site. Local and exotic lithic materials appear at both sites. Alicia Castro (Universidad Nacional De La Plata) investigated archaeological sites along the coastline in the Santa Cruz region. Since little archaeological work has been carried out there, she currently is describing site types and defining local chronological sequences. She has located 12 sites, including open-air campsites, caves, and shell middens, among others. The lithic industries are of the Casapedrense and Tehuelchense types of the Central Plateau farther inland. 196 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH Gustavo Politis (CONICET, MHNLP, Universidad Nacional Centro Buenos Aires) continued his research on early man in the Argentine Pampa. Additional work was carried out at the Arroyo Seco 2 site. Retouched flakes made of quartz and Megatherium bones with clear butchering marks also were recovered. Below this level, dated around 6500 B.C., was the skeleton of a human child associated with funerary offerings similar to those previously found at the site. In conjunction with M6nica Salemme, Patricia Ma- drid (CONICET, MHNLP), and Fernando Oliva (Con- sejo de Investigaci6nes Cientificas, MHNLP), Politis also is excavating at La Toma, a multicomponent, open- air site that radiocarbon dates between 5505 ? 200 B.P. (SI-6450a) and A.D. 995 ? 65 (SI-6452) and is characterized by guanaco hunting. Excavations also are underway at the Laguna Tres Reyes site which has Interserrana components. Also associated with Politis's project is a survey by Patricia Madrid, who has located several rockshelters and caves with rock painting in the Pillahuinco area. Fernando Oliva also began work in the Ventania area where he has located several open-air sites, including a large quarry that provided the only source of raw material in the eastern Pampa. The districts of Viedma in Patagonia and Guardia Mitre in the Pampa of Rio Negro are the scenes of much modern economic development and construc- tion activity. Lidia Nacuzzi and Alfredo Fisher have formulated a cultural-resource-management program to minimize the potential destruction of archaeological sites and to obtain new archaeological information from poorly understood areas. The major objectives of the program are to carry out background research on pre- vious archaeological work in the area, to formulate hypotheses on the prehistory of past cultures, and to propose a functional classification of open-air sites, caves, rockshelters, and burial sites. The project will be sponsored by the Universidad Nacional De Coma- hue, the Centro Regional Zona Atlantica de Viedma, the Legislatura de la Provincia De Rio Negro, and la Municipalidad de Carmen de Patagones. Valliserrana, Mendoza, and Neuquen. Mariano Gambier (Universidad Nacional De San Juan) directed excavations at Cerro Calvario in the Calingasta Valley. He has recorded four occupational episodes charac- terized by circular, semisubterranean houses of stone and cane, mummies, and a wide variety of ceramics and vegetal material. Beginning around A.D. 660, local agriculturists resided at the site; they eventually were replaced by different ethnic groups invading from northwest Argentina and from across the mountains in Chile. Gambier also has been surveying sites in the extreme southern end of the San Juan Valley. Excavations at Cieneguita, Acequi6n, and Retamito revealed four oc- cupational phases related to successive village agricul- tural development. He reports that settlement patterns adapted through time to changing landscapes condi- tioned by local geomorphological developments. The Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas y Museo, under Gambier's direction, has published several re- search monographs over the past two years. Mario Consens is studying prehispanic rock painting in the same area. Jorge Fernandez (INA) is excavating at Haichol cave in Nefiquen, where inhabitants primarily based their diet on the collection ofpehuen nuts (Araucaria arau- cana) and secondarily on hunting guanaco and small game. This is the first site in the South Andes to yield evidence of an economy heavily based on nuts. Twen- ty-eight 14C dates reveal an occupational sequence last- ing from 5000 B.C.-A.D. 1500. The earliest occupation is characterized by guanaco hunting and stemless, tri- angular projectile points. Later, hunters and gatherers appeared with milling stones and similar point types. The major occupation occurred around A.D. 700-1500. Ceramics were introduced around A.D. 100; basketry, tembetas, and other traits appeared between A.D. 100 and 800; and metal, corn, and squash came in around A.D. 1400 and 1500. Since 1982, Rafael A. Gonii (CONICET, INA) has been studying late-prehispanic and early historical-pe- riod settlement patterns in the central cordillera of Nefiquen. He discovered a chain of indigenous defen- sive structures (pircas) located in several valleys (Haichol, Malleo, Quilca, Vilcunco, and Ruca Choroi). Gofii views the construction of these fortresses as a response to the European invasion from Chile and Ar- gentina. Patagonia. Hugo G. Nami (UBA, Programa de Es- tudios Prehist6ricas [PREP], CONICET) continued his use-wear study of a wide variety of stone tool types (especially of Fish-tail and Toldense-type triangular points) from sites in both the Argentine and Chilean Patagonia. He also is investigating the type and dis- tribution of various lithic raw materials available in the region. Jean Marie Franchomme (Centro Austral de Inves- tigaciones Cientificas [CADIC], CONICET) is studying rock painting of the central plateau of southern Pata- gonia (Santa Cruz). The geography, motif design, lay- out of panels with or without art, and number of use episodes are recorded. Animal motifs are common and very homogenous stylistically. Curiously, no sexual or- gans or eyes are exhibited. Guanacos are the most com- mon zoomorphic theme, followed by felines (Felis puma, Felis colo-colo). Negative hand painting, exe- cuted in isolated form or superimposed on zoomorphic motifs, is the most prevalent nonzoomorphic element. Dominant colors are red, black, and white; yellow and green appear occasionally. Anthropomorphic and geo- metric designs of the same colors occur infrequently with animal themes. Chemical and mineralogic studies of pigments are underway. Luis Abel Orquera and Ernesto Luis Piana (Asocia- ci6n de Investigaciones Antropol6gicas, CADIC) con- tinue analysis of remains from the 6,000-year-old Tu- nel I site in the Beagle Channel. In 1987, the research team, assisted by Adrian Schiavini, Jorje Merenzon, Osvaldo Herrera, Ramiro March, and Vivian Schein- sohn, studied the spatial distribution of artifacts and features, and the seasonality of occupation. They report that the study of 80 thin sections of the upper canines of pinnipeds indicates the site was occupied in winter (March-November). Orquera and Piana suggest that 197</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY short-term summer occupation (December-January) occurred at the Shamakush I and II sites, as evidenced by seasonal indicators on guanaco bones. A second project by Orquera and Piana, with the Spanish archaeologists Jorje Estevez Escalera, Asun- ci6n Vila Mitja, and Errikarta Imanol Yll Aguirre (Uni- versidad Aut6noma de Barcelona), is aimed at studying the discrepancies between ethnohistoric and ethno- graphic documentation on the lifeways of indigenous groups and the late prehistoric archaeological record. The Spanish will apply the results of this investigation to their reevaluation of certain methodological and the- oretical concepts used in their country to model past hunter-gatherer societies. The Argentines are more in- terested in the impact of European whale and sea-lion hunting on the lifeway of indigenous groups of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1987 and 1988, David Yesner (University of Alas- ka) undertook a survey and excavation of the Playa Larga locale on the northern Beagle Channel of Ar- gentine Tierra del Fuego, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Earthwatch. Playa Lar- ga is one of the largest sites in the Beagle Channel region. The size of the site probably relates to the very large, flat area available for houses and beaching of boats, unusual for the normally rugged coastline. As a result, unlike many other areas in the region, house rings tend to be discrete, nonoverlapping structures. This allowed testing of four models of the origin of these ring features, created by ancestral Yamana (Yah- gans): (1) that they are natural features created by beach processes, some of which were occupied by the Ya- mana; (2) that they were initially dune-like natural fea- tures further modified by banking of refuse to form complete rings; (3) that they were created by purely cultural processes, as semisubterranean houses; or (4) that they were created by cultural processes, as refuse deposits from above-ground circular structures of the ethnographically known type. Eighty-five monticulos were surveyed and mapped, and two were excavated. The excavated structures fell entirely within the Recent phase of the Beagle Channel (ca. A.D. 1-1550). The results suggest that several processes were responsible for the montFculos, and that at least some clearly are semisubterranean structures. The variance of this pat- tern from the ethnographic record from the region sug- gests that important transformations of lifeways may have occurred between the Recent phase and the eth- nohistorically known Yamana described by Darwin and others, and offers a challenge to widely held as- sumptions about the simplicity of the Yamana lifestyle. CONICET provided Luis Borrero (UBA) a one-year fellowship to study site-formation processes in the U.S. He compared the results of his bone taphonomy studies in Tierra del Fuego with materials collected by Gary Haynes (University of Nevada-Reno) in Canada, the United States, and Zimbabwe. He also studied with Diane Gifford-Gonzalez (University of California-Santa Cruz). These studies have allowed Borrero to identify and compare idiosyncratic processes occurring in Tier- ra del Fuego with general processes taking place in other areas. Borrero has reevaluated the bone data from eight Patagonian sites. On Staten Island, the outermost island in the Tierra del Fuego network, Victoria D. Horwitz (University of Kentucky) continued survey and excavation of sites on the northern coast. Scattered and deflated dune sites have been located in Flinders and San Antonio bays and on Colnett Bay Beach. Preliminary results suggest that mollusks, penguins, sea mammals, cormorants, sea otters, and fish were dietary mainstays. Bahia Crossley, a periodically occupied shell midden, is the largest intact site on the island. Radiocarbon dates in- dicate that the island was inhabited by at least 2500 B.P. Horwitz reports that the ratio of bone to stone tools at the site is 10 to 1. Staten Island is seen as a seasonally occupied island that was one of several sea- sonal or annual stopovers in a mobile maritime life- way. The Wenner-Gren Foundation, IBM Corpora- tion, and Patagonian Outfitters supported her project. Jose Luis Lanata (CONICET, UBA) continued his research on the Mitre Peninsula of Tierra del Fuego, excavating at Rancho Donata and Bahia Thetis. These two sites differ from other middens in the area in that they are thin deposits (10 cm or less) buried in sand. Periodic use of these sites is indicated by superimposed hearths. The cervical vertebrae of birds and fish were recovered. Lanata also located 12 other sites in the Cerro Mesa area. Expedient lithic tools and bone re- mains of birds and sea lions were found on the surface of these sites. Excavations also were carried out at the CTS and Aleph localities near Cabo San Vicente. At Aleph, four sites were excavated, one yielding a human skeleton, which is under study by Ricardo Guich6n. Hugo R. Nami conducted taphonomic research at the shell midden of Rancho Donata, where midden sediments were transported 20 m over a period of two years by bioturbation and animal trampling. In addi- tion, experimental work was done on the deposition and disturbance of a wide variety of cultural debris in a modern choza hut. Working in the Piedra Parada region, in collabora- tion with Carlos Aschero and other colleagues of the Instituto Nacional de Anthropolo6gia, Cristina Bellelli (CONICET, INA) is carrying out an intrasite spatial analysis of excavated materials from selected levels of the Campo Moncada 2 rockshelter radiocarbon dated between 5080 ? 100 B.P. (INGEIS-666) and 1750 ? 80 B.P. (INGEIS-669). Discrete lithic scatters and plant- processing areas suggest temporary campsites of small transitory groups during the fall and early summer months. Catchment analysis reveals a wide range of lithic raw materials brought to the site. Rock painting has been recorded at a nearby rockshelter (Campo Cer- da 1). Bellelli also is involved in a diachronic study of hunt- er-gatherer adaptative strategies in the Patagonian for- est-steppe ecotone in Santa Cruz. Excavation at Cerro Casa de Piedra 5 and 7 and Campo Rio Roble reveals early occupational episodes related to the Rio Pinturas IIa culture, beginning around 6780 ? 110 B.P. (IN- GLEIS-583). A mixed economy of plant gathering and hunting is documented by the floral and faunal re- mains. Small transitory groups repeatedly occupied these sites during different seasons of the year. Evi- dence obtained from several late sites (radiocarbon dat- ed between 3150 ? 90 B.P. [INGLEIS-1098] and 990 ? 110 B.P. [INGLEIS- 1099]) shows larger groups liv- 198 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 19891</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH ing together on a more permanent basis and exploiting a wider range of resource zones. Since 1980, Bellelli, M. T. Civalero de Biset, R. Goni, R. Molinari, C. Perez de Micou, and C. Aschero (project director) (all INA) have been collaborating in the work. CHILE. A comparative physical-anthropological study of human skeletal remains from late Pleistocene and early Holocene sites in South America has been initiated by Patricia Soto-Heim (Mus&amp;e de l'Homme). To date, she has examined skeletons from various sites in Chile and Brazil. Fransico Rothhammer and Claudio Silva (Univer- sidad de Chile [UC]) have examined archaeological, craniometric, and genetic data to reconstruct possible migration routes used by the first humans in colonizing South America. Special emphasis has been given to the development of craniometric isoline maps by means of a statistical methodology designed to test models of population displacement based on archaeological data. Preliminary results support Donald Lathrap's model of a spread of early Tropical Forest cultures into the Andean region. These results are compared to J. Green- berg's linguistic data on the peopling of the Americas and to other archaeological data. Future work will con- centrate on a DNA mitochondrial study of Chilean mummies. Atacama. In the Lauca National Park in northern Highland Chile, Carlos Baied (University of Colorado) is investigating the impact of climatic fluctuations and volcanic activity on changes in the environment and, thus, in the food production economy of early hunter- gatherer populations. His major objective is to study whether domestication of wild ungulates was underway by 4500 B.P., and whether or not the shift from food gatherer to food producer has been the result of a series of changing environmental conditions that modified resource productivity in the high-altitude Lake Titicaca basin. As yet, no clear basis for climatic changes that is supported by paleogeographic studies has been es- tablished in the region. Baied proposes to conduct pa- leoenvironmental studies (including pollen and macro- botanical analyses) to focus on this problem. The results will be compared with site-specific archaeological evi- dence and other data sets. His research is in conjunc- tion with the Universidad de Taracapa, the Corpora- ci6n Nacional Forestal (CONAF), and the Chilean National Parks Administration. Ivan Mufioz, Mario Rivera, and Percy Dauelsberg (Universidad de Taracapa) are joined by Nicki Clark (Washington University) and Virgilio Schiappacasse (Sociedad Chilena de Arqueologia) in a long-term in- vestigation of processes of culture change and devel- opment in the lowlands and highlands of extreme northern Chile. Settlement-pattern surveys have been carried out in the Azapa Valley and in the delta of the Camarones River, showing that the coastal settlement pattern was characterized by "fusion-fission" move- ment between large and small sites located in different seasonal-resource zones. Agricultural villages of the later ceramic periods are similar in form and development to those in the Caplina, Sama, and Chiribaya valleys in southern Peru. Work at a cemetery associated with a plant collecting and fishing village in the Camarones Valley, dated around 1000 B.C., yielded early ceramics, gourds, wool textiles, and snuff tubes. Mufioz reports that thermoluminescence analysis of a series of ceramic samples from various sites is underway by the Uni- versidad Catolica de Chile. In San Pedro de Atacama, Maria Antonietta Costa (Universidad del Norte [UN]), Walter Neves, and Ri- cardo Santaro (Museu Emilio Goeldi, Brazil) are ex- amining skeletal remains from 300 graves at Solcor 3 and Quitor 6 (A.D. 500-1200). Their aim is to examine genetic differences between the two populations in or- der to determine social and dietary differences. Ar- chaeological information on grave goods and other cul- tural traits associated with the skeletons is studied in conjunction with Agustin Llagostera (UN). Agustin Llagostera, Maria Antonietta Costa, and Francisco Tellez (UN) initiated research on trans-An- dean interregional development of prehispanic socie- ties in the San Pedro de Atacama area. They are in- terested in local and nonlocal (Bolivia and Argentina) cultural forces that shaped San Pedro culture through time. In 1987, they studied materials from more than 3,000 graves in order to gain a basic understanding of interregional contacts and chronological sequences. Ceramic and other collections housed at various in- stitutions in Bolivia and Argentina also were exam- ined. More fieldwork is planned in 1989. Early in 1988, Thomas F. Lynch (Cornell Univer- sity) completed the third phase of his studies of the archaeology and geomorphology of the basin of the Salar de Punta Negra. Human use of this diminishing and increasingly saline lake, in the Atacama Desert, can be traced from Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic times until the Spanish invasion of Chile. In all, Lynch located 115 sites, including early habitations, quarries, rock paintings, and shelters, as well as campsites on the beaches and deltas of the receding lakes. Shoreline features are best developed and preserved in the Pa- jonales and Aguas Calientes basins, the latter still con- taining freshwater ice. Of considerable general interest are new segments of the Inka road, tambos, road mark- ers, and even horse gear possibly dating to the initial Spanish incursion. Minera Escondida (Utah Interna- tional) and the NSF supported the project. Senior col- laborators in 1988 were John Alden (Ann Arbor), Jane Flaherty (Earthwatch), Andrew Fox (Geological Sci- ences, Cornell University), Sarah Millspaugh (USDA Forest Service), and Calogero Santoro (Universidad de Tarapaca). Investigations will continue at Pajonales and Aguas Calientes, but also at Catarpe Tambo and along the Inca road. Valles Transversales-Central Valle,. Miguel Cer- vellino Giannoni (Museo Regional De Atacama) con- tinued his work on prehispanic metallurgy and rock painting in the southern Atacama and Valles Tran- versales regions. He particularly is interested in the development of agricultural villages. Hans Niemeyer (Museo Nacional De Historia Natural) is collaborating with Cervellino. Gast6n Castillo G6mez (Museo Arqueologico de La Serena) began work, in conjunction with Niemeyer and Cervellino, at several sites of the Molle culture (A.D. 400-1000) in the highlands of Copiapo in north-central Chile. interzonal contact and socioeconomic relations 199</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY between sites are under study through the analysis of architectural traits, ceramic styles, and other materials. Castillo and Niemeyer also have recorded several pet- roglyph sites of the El Encanto style, associated with the Molle culture. Future work is planned in other valleys, especially Choapa. As part of a long-term, intervalley research project designed to study the Inca road and settlement system in the Central Valley of Chile, Ruben Stehberg (Museo Nacional) surveyed sites in the Hurtado, Los Molles, Choapa, Aconcaqua and other river valleys, in addition to border lands between Chile and Argentina. He is planning a large-scale, joint project with several Ar- gentine colleagues to investigate trans-Andean Inca or- ganization. Araucania. Americo Gordon (Comisi6n Nacional de Investigaci6n Cientifica y Technol6gica [CONI- CYT]) continued research at the Spanish fortress of Carilafquen in the temperate rainforest of south-central Chile. Study of the original architectural foundation of the fort shows that it was surrounded by a deep ditch or moat. Ceramics, pipes, projectile points, and the remains of wild and domesticated animals, of both indigenous and European origin, have been found. His- torical evidence suggests that the fortress was destroyed by the Mapuche in 1599, at which time the Indians remodeled and lived in the fort. This is the first fortress associated with the Spanish Conquest to be excavated in Chile. In 1988, Tom D. Dillehay (University of Kentucky, Universidad Austral de Chile [UAC]) continued eth- noarchaeological and ethnographic research on the spa- tial and material correlates of, and relations between, large-scale public ceremony and the lineage-based set- tlement system. Work concentrated on relations of wealth, land inheritance, leadership, and kinship struc- ture. Ethnohistorical and archaeological study of six- teenth-century Spanish fortresses and settlements in the Tolten Valley was initiated by Aldo Vidal (Uni- versidad Cat6lica de Temuco), Patricio Sanzana, and Jose Saavedra (Universidad Cat6lica de Chile, UAC), in conjunction with Dillehay. The military strategy and economic organization of the Spanish presence, and the eventual defeat of the Mapuche population, are examined as a case study of a militaristic state society imposed on a horticultural chiefdom. Canals. Patricia Curry (Cambridge University) has finished the first phase of the systematic survey of Puer- to Eden in the Patagonian canals south of the Gulf of Penas. A complex of sites was found after intensive subsurface testing; she identified 13 middens of prob- able aboriginal origin in a 23-km2 study area. The mid- dens ranged up to approximately 400 m in area and 2 m in thickness. Analysis now is underway to date the deposits and identify the nature of the stratigraphic change. In addition, smaller sites and a network of trails were observed. Soil and midden samples were taken through the entire stratigraphic record, for analysis of site diversity and material content. Radiocarbon anal- ysis is expected to provide the first dates for human occupation of this section of the coast. The locational pattern around Puerto Eden now is understood well enough to permit prediction of site location in the im- mediate area. This knowledge will in turn allow effec- tive exploration and meaningful comparison of the unexplored canals to the west, as well as of the better- known areas to the south. These data provide a unique resource for study of ancient occupation and migration patterns. Curry's project was supported by the Leakey Foundation. Francisco Mena (UCLA, Ministerio de Educacion de Chile) is conducting, under the auspices of the Uni- versidad de Magallanes and the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino, a multidisciplinary study of prehistoric settlement and subsistence patterns in the middle course of the Rio Ibafiez in central Patagonia. In 1987 and 1988, he studied aerial photographs and other data to define ecological zones. Mena relocated rock painting sites (found previously by J. L. Bate), and discovered several new open-air sites. Three sites have been ex- cavated and faunal analyses are underway. Several sites also were recorded in the mixed evergreen forest to the west, a previously unknown area. Carlos Ocampo (UC) continued his integrated eth- noarchaeological, ethnohistoric, and archaeological studies of settlement and subsistence patterns of late prehistoric and historical-period indigenous groups in the Chilean canals. In addition to his own work, he collaborated with Curry and Mena on their projects. Patagonia. Julieta G6mez Otero (Universidad Na- cional de la Patagonia), Mateo Martinic Beros, Alfredo Prieto, and Pedro Cardenas (Universidad de Magal- lanes [UM]) report that they are investigating Junius Bird's late prehispanic Period IV hunter-gatherer oc- cupation in the valleys of Rio Chico and Rio Gallejos Chico on the Argentine and Chilean border. Excava- tions at the Potrok-aike rockshelter and other sites show that projectile point types continuously were used throughout the late prehispanic and early historic pe- riods. They believe that a conservative hunter-gatherer society lasted from about 2000 B.C. to the early historic period. Working under the auspices of the Instituto de Pat- agonia and the UM (Puerto Natales), Hugo G. Nami (UBA, PREP, CONICET) carried out his third field season at the Cueva del Medio site in Seno de Ultima Esperanza. A Paleoindian occupation, defined by ex- tinct faunal species (Hippidium sp., Mylodon listai), Fish-tail points, and other lithics, bone tools, and hearths, was radiocarbon dated at 10,550 + 120 B.P. (GR N-14911) and 10,310 + 70 B.P. (GR N-14912). This Magallanes I component was overlaid by a Ma- gallanes III occupation associated with similar faunal species. Tom D.
