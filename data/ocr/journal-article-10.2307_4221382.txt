Socha Physical versus chemical defence mechanisms in toxic Gastrolobium Received: 12 November 1995 / Accepted: 14 April 1996 Abstract The degree to which physical defence mecha- nisms are present in toxic species of Gastrolobium was compared with the known fluoroacetate (the toxic princi- ple) concentrations of these plants using both histologi- cal leaf sections prepared from fresh leaves (4 species), and a variety of visual external traits measured from her- barium specimens (28 species). There was a strong nega- tive correlation between the presence of physical deter- rents (e.g. area of fibres, number and length of spines) and the fluoroacetate concentration of each species. This suggests that, with respect to their leaves, individual spe- cies have established a compromise between producing physical grazing deterrents and the adoption of chemi- cally mediated antiherbivore strategies. Key words Australia ? Plant animal interaction ? Physical and chemical defence ? Gastrolobium ? Fluoroacetate Introduction Plants of the Australian genus Gastrolobium (Papilion- oideae: tribe Podalyriae) produce considerable amounts of fluorocetate as a chemically mediated defence strate- gy against herbivory (Aplin 1971; Twigg and King 1991; Twigg 1994). Fluoroacetate is highly toxic to most or- ganisms as, after being converted in vivo to fluorocitrate, it inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme aconitate hydratase, resulting in energy deprivation and death (Morrison and Peters 1954). In the southwest of Western Australia, where most of these plants occur (Aplin 1971; Twigg and King 1991), native animals including insects, reptiles, birds and mammals, have coexisted with this fluoroacetate-bearing vegetation for many thousands of years and have developed varying degrees of tolerance to this potent toxin (Twigg and King 1991). The genus Gastrolobium has undergone a recent taxo- nomic revision with 40 species now recognised (Crisp and Weston 1987). The concentration of fluoroacetate within these plants can vary between species, regions, seasons and plant parts. Within this genus, fluoroacetate concentration of air-dried leaves can vary between indi- vidual species from undetectable levels to in excess of 2600 mg/kg of leaves and the seed of some species can contain up to 6000 mg fluoroacetate/kg (Aplin 1971; Twigg 1994; Twigg et al. 1996). However, during our field studies there was a strong suggestion that the spe- cies with the least amounts of fluoroacetate had devel- oped the greatest level of physical defence (e.g. spines and more sclerified leaves), and vice versa. In this paper we explore this possibility further by comparing the de- gree to which the physical and chemical defence mecha- nisms are developed in each species and whether this can be related to their known concentration of fluoroacetate. Materials and methods Collection of field samples Leaf samples were collected from four species which represented the known range of fluoroacetate concentration in this genus; G. spinosum (100 mg fluoroacetate/kg leaves; Aplin 1971), G. calyci- num (400 mg/kg), G. parviflorum (2500 mg/kg), and G. bilobum (2650 mg/kg). Five leaves of similar age (recently expanded/just mature) from five plants (25 leaves in total) of each of these spe- cies were collected during February and March 1994. These spe- cies are not all sympatric, but where possible we always collected the samples from the same locality. Upon collection, all leaves were immediately fixed in a 1:3 volume of formalin/glacial acetic acid/alcohol (FAA) solution. Histological sections Fixed leaves were passed through an aqueous ethanol series which ranged from 10% through to 100%, and then immediately embed- L. E.

Two ??-???-thick transverse sections (TS) were cut from each leaf. These were approximately one-third of the distance from each end of the leaves. Sections were mount- ed onto a microscope slide and dewaxed with xylene, dehydrated through 100% to 70% ethanol, and stained in 1% aqueous Safrani and 0.2% Fast Green in 95% ethanol. Final mounts were in DPX. For each transverse section, a black and white trace taken from a colour photograph at 40x magnification was used to determine the amount of tannin in the upper and lower leaf regions, the area of lignin/fibre, and the TS leaf area using a DIAS II DELTA-T im- age analyser. The number of veins per transverse section, the num- ber of fibres and xylem vessels per vein (5 fields at lOOOx), the di- ameter of the fibre and xylem (5 fields at 400x), the cuticle thick- ness (5 fields at lOOOx), and the distance between veins (5 fields at 400x) were all determined using a CH Olympus compound mi- croscope and an eye piece graticule. The average of the two TS of each leaf was then used to represent each of these measures. Herbarium specimens Using specimens from the Western Australian Herbarium, the fol- lowing characters were measured for five leaves from five individ- ual plants for each of the 28 species of Gastrolobium whose fluo- roacetate content is known (see Aplin 1971): spines per leaf, length of all spines (?0.1 mm), shape of spine (1 = absent, 2 = hooked, 3 = curved, 4 = straight), hairs (1 = present, 2 = ab- sent), visual toughness/'Meatheryness" (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high, 4 = very high), leaf orientation with respect to the branch/stem (1 = parallel, 2 = recurved down, 3 = recurved up- wards, 4 = horizontal), shape of leaf (1 = subulate, 2 = oval, 3 = oblong/elliptical, 4 = triangular) shape of leaf margin ( 1 = rev- olute, 2 = entire) and leaf dimensions. The number of leaves per 10 cm of stem from its apex (3 replicates per plant) was also in- cluded as an index of leaf density. Fluoroacetate concentration Determining the fluoroacetate concentration of individual plants was beyond the resources of our study (fluoroacetate analysis costs about Aus $90 per sample). Therefore we used Aplin's (1971) values for each herbarium species, as his values more closely approximate the time of collection of these plants. Howev- er, for the histological data, we used all known information on the fluoroacetate content of these plants (Aplin 1971; Twigg et al. 1996). Two indices of fluoroacetate concentration were used: the maximum known level and the mean of the cited levels. The distri- bution of fluoroacetate-bearing vegetation in Australia is given in Twigg and King (1991), and the list of species used and their fluo- roacetate concentration is provided in Table 3. Data analysis For the histological and herbarium data, an average was deter- mined for each plant for each character and a mean value was then calculated from the five plants of each species to provide one val- ue per character per species. Where applicable, characters were standardised to a measure per TS leaf area. Partial plots of the data were then used to determine those characters which correlated with the concentration of fluoroacetate. Using this subset of char- acters, each species was then ranked from low (few physical deter- rents) to high (considerable physical deterrents) for each of these individual characters, and a total rank score determined for each species. Species with an identical character received equal rank for that trait. The rank scores were then plotted against the known flu- oroacetate concentrations of each species. A Pearson's correlation matrix was established for these char- acters and their relationship to the concentration of fluoroacetate in each species. Discriminate function analyses were also under- taken using the same subset of characters and the Mahalanobis distances. Both tests were undertaken using the SYSTAT statistical package (Wilkinson 1989). Results Histological The following traits were used in the initial analyses of the histological leaf data for G. spinosum, G. calycinum, G. bilobum and G. parviflorum: the diameter of fibres, the amount of total fibre (mm2) per mm2 of TS, total tan- nin (mm2) per mm2 TS, total number of veins per mm2 TS, the number of xylem vessels per vein, and the thick- ness of the cuticle (??t?). All these characters are likely to be involved in determining the toughness/palatability of leaves. With a Wilk's Lamba F-statistic of 26.68 (df= 18, 31 ; ? &lt;0.0000) all of these characters were highly signifi- cant (all ? values ranged from 0.002 to 0.0000) in dis- criminating these four species and, using these characters, all 20 plants (4x5) were correctly allocated by the dis- criminate function analysis (Fig. 1). The least toxic spe- cies, G. spinosum (Prickly Leaf Poison) was clearly sepa- rated from the other three more toxic species (Fig. 1 ). The raw data for all measurements are given in Table 4. As we were able to separate these four species by their leaf anatomy, we then calculated a rank score for each species using the five significant histological char- acters relevant to physical deterrents: diameter of fibres, the amount of fibre, number of veins, the number of xy- lem vessels, and cuticle thickness (see above). Species were ranked from lowest to highest for each character, the ranks tallied, and the total score plotted against the known concentration of fluoroacetate for each species (Fig. 2). There was a very clear relationship between the degree to which physical deterrents have developed and the amount of fluoroacetate produced by each species. Those species with the lowest amounts of fluoroacetate had the greatest level of physical deterrents (Fig. 2).

Abbreviations as for Fig. 2 Herbarium specimens To test whether visual, external characteristics could dif- ferentiate between the four species used in the histologi- cal study, we measured a variety of visual traits of five herbarium specimens of each species (five leaves per plant). Four traits gave good separation between species with respect to their fluoroacetate concentration: the number of spines per leaf, the length of these spines, the shape of the spine, and the toughness index. The four species were ranked using these characteristics and the total rank score for each species plotted against their flu- oroacetate concentration (Fig. 3). Again there was a highly significant relationship between the presence of physical deterrents such as spines and the concentration of fluoroacetate (Fig. 3). There was also strong congru- ence between the histological and "herbarium" data sets (Figs. 2, 3). There was a strong negative correlation between the four physical traits measured for the 28 species of Gastr- olobium (five plants per species) and the amount of fluo- roacetate they produce (Table 1). The rank score for each species (from lowest to highest) based on the four signif- icant traits (Table 1) also showed a significant (P &lt;0.001) negative linear relationship with fluoroacetate concentration (Fig. 4). The raw data are given in Table 5. Based on their known fluoroacetate-concentration, the 28 species used for the herbarium study were grouped into three categories: low, 0-200 mg fluoroacetate/kg air- dried leaves; medium, 201-1000 mg/kg; and high, &gt;1000 mg/kg (from Aplin 1971). A discriminate func- tion analysis of the four significant morphological traits (Table 1) correctly classified 61% of cases (Table 2; Wilks Lamba F-statistic 3.817, ? = 0.002, df = 8, 44). Those species with medium levels of fluoroacetate were the most often misclassified (Table 2). These species are also known to display the greatest variation in their fluo- roacetate concentration (Aplin 1971).

(1996) pie, was negatively correlated with fluoroacetate (r = 0.97) but the relationship between tannin and fluoro- acetate was less clear (Fig. 5). G. parviflorum (Box Poi- son) differs from the other three species in this respect. With G. parviflorum included, the linear r was 0.42 but with this species excluded, the other three species gave an r of 0.90. G. parviflorum was formerly classified as an Oxylobium, while the other three species have always been classified as Gastrolobium. The leaf structure of G. parviflorum was also found to be different from that of the other three species examined histologically (Fig. 6). The vascular bundles were more frequent, lignified tissue was more prevalent near the upper surface, and tannin was both cellular and intercellular in G. parviflorum (Fig. 6). Spines were absent from the highly toxic spe- cies, and were generally most abundant or obtained greater lengths on the least toxic plants (Fig. 5). Discussion There was a clear negative correlation between the pres- ence of physical deterrents and the concentration of fluo- roacetate in the 28 species of Gastrolobium we exam- ined. However, deciding what characters are important in the defence of plants can be difficult, and these decisions may contain anthropomorphic biases. For example, with respect to the toxic Gastrolobiums, we decided that straight, horizontal spines are likely to provide greater protection to these plants from many vertebrate herbi- vores than are spines which are curved, and curved spines are better than no spines at all. The 28 herbarium species we used were all fully developed plants. It is im- portant to remember that, in addition to affecting adult plants, the selection pressure for the production of high levels of fluoroacetate will be also acting through its ef- fects on seedlings, young plants and reproductive tissue. Furthermore, because fluoroacetate attacks a metabolic pathway common to all organisms, and because fluoro- acetate-bearing vegetation has been present in Australia for at least 30 000 years (Twigg and King 1991), it is dif-</page><page sequence="5">OECOLOGIA 108(1996) ?

How- ever, for our purposes, we assumed that many of the ex- ternal characters we measured, such as the presence of relatively long, widely spaced spines, were aimed at ver- tebrate herbivores. Our study, therefore, has been mainly considered from the view point of a vertebrate herbivore. Plants have finite resources and they therefore need to obtain a balance between reproduction, producing vege- tative growth, and the development of antiherbivore mechanisms.

It is possible that those species with high levels of fluoroacetate have experienced greater selection pressure from insect predators than have those species with re- duced fluoroacetate concentrations and in which physical deterrents are more developed. However, given that most fluoroacetate-bearing vegetation in Australia is confined to a relatively small area in the south west corner of Western Australia, and as the toxic plants in this area be- long to a single genus, it is difficult to envisage the evo- lutionary selection pressures necessary to evoke this re- sponse. A further possibility is that, being a fatty acid, fluoroacetate may have a dual role in plants by acting as both an energy store and an antiherbivore device. Such a role has been suggested for some proteins (Bell 1960) and alkaloids (Janzen 1969). The high levels of fluoroac- etate in the young tissues of the fluoroacetate-producing plants (Aplin 1971; Vickery and Vickery 1972) would provide these tissues with some protection from grazing and also provide a reliable energy source for their con- tinued development. There is a metabolic cost associated with the produc- tion of fluoroacetate (Peters 1972), and fluoroacetate- bearing vegetation in Australia and Africa must actively concentrate fluoride in their tissues despite the very low levels of fluoride in soils from these regions (0.98-1.16 fluoride ppm, L.E. Twigg, unpublished data; and 1-6 ppm fluorine, Vickery and Vickery 1972). Ephemeral tissues such as flowers and young leaves contain the greatest amounts of fluoroacetate (Aplin 1971; Vickery and Vickery 1972; Twigg et al. 1996) but fluoroacetate is also present in the stems and roots (Vickery and Vickery 1972). This is consistent with chemically mediated de- fence strategies (Cates and Rhoades 1977) as the plants are protecting their most essential tissues. There are three possible explanations for the apparent positive relationship between the amount of tannin pres- ent in the leaves and the concentration of fluoroacetate in the four species we examined histologically. Firstly, while we could positively confirm the presence of tan- nin, we did not analyse which particular form it was. It is possible that the fluoroacetate may be linked (attached?) to the tannin in some way, thereby explaining the posi- tive association between tannin and fluoroacetate. At present, the pathways involved in the production of fluo- roacetate (Peters 1972; Vickery and Vickery 1975), and where the fluoroacetate is stored within the plants, are not understood. Secondly, the plants with high levels of fluoroacetate may be producing two different secondary compounds in their defensive arsenal; one which is acute in action (fluoroacetate), the other which has a more chronic effect (tannin). Thirdly, it appears that at least some species may be substituting some of the fluoroace- tate with tannin in their older leaves and concentrating the acute-acting fluoroacetate in those tissues which they can ill afford to lose, such as flowers and young leaves. The presence of tannin, together with smaller amounts of fluoroacetate, in the more mature parts of the plant would generally prevent the total loss of these tissues. The importance of each of these possibilities will depend upon the benefit-cost to the plants which is likely to vary between seasons and habitats. In their revision of the Papilionoideae, Crisp and Weston (1987) used the presence or absence of fluoroac- etate (based on the colorimetrie method used by Aplin 1971) as one of their character traits when reclassifying the toxic and nontoxic species formerly classified as either Gastrolobium and Oxylobium. However, produc- tion of significant amounts of fluoroacetate by plants (Gastrolobium, Acacia, Dichapetalum, Palicoure?, Twigg and King 1991) occurs on at least three different</page><page sequence="7">OECOLOGIA 108(1996) ?

Bars are 100 ??t? continents and involves in excess of 60 species. Traces of fluoroacetate have also been shown to be produced by a variety of other species of plants (Lovelace et al. 1968; Vartiainen and Gynther 1984; Twigg et al. 1996). Medi- um levels (40-80 mg fluoroacetate/kg dry weight) were also recently found in the young leaves of a former spe- cies of Gastrolobium (now Nemcia spathulata) not known to be toxic (Twigg et al. 1996). Thus, although it may be present in insignificant quantities, the ability of plants to produce fluoroacetate may be relatively wide- spread. We suggest, therefore, that the reported pres- ence/absence of fluoroacetate may not always be a good indicator of the phylogenetic relationships of plants.
