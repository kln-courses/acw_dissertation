<plain_text><page sequence="1">A4n Editor Looks at Higher Education The Problem of Partial Fulfillment By ERWIN D. CANHAM IT SEEMS to me that education today accurately displays the prob- lems which trouble our whole system. These are the problems of partial fulfillment. They are the result of the immense degree of social progress we have already attained. We would not be so worried if we had not come so far. This is our challenge in education, in eco- nomic growth, in social morality, in race relations, in civil rights, and even in international relations. We would not be so worried about education if we had not already created such a splendid educational system. We would not be so dis- tressed about 5-per cent unemployment if we were not in an economic boom. We would not be so troubled about our international balance of payments, for instance, if our economic system had not produced such a massive amount of exportable capital. We would not be disturbed about the erosion of moralities if we had not in fact raised our total moral standards far above the nineteenth century's various narrow blind- nesses. We would not have a crisis in race relations if Negroes had not already come so far in American life. We would not know where Vietnam is if the United States had not been able to accept unprece- dented responsibilities for curbing aggression and protecting freedom at the far ends of the earth. Our problems, in short, are problems of strength and progress and achievement. It may be that self-renewal, in John Gardner's terms, aptly describes our best approach to these individual and social problems.' I agree with most of what he says, and yet his excellent phrase does not totally satisfy me. It is the very achievement of our society and of ourselves, it seems to me, that intensifies our problems today. Our accomplishments create satiety on the one hand and hunger on the other. It is a divine dis- content we experience. Apply this thesis from the viewpoint of education. I think our accomplishments are perfectly enormous. I do not need to describe the scope and strengths of our educational system. Both in quantitative and in qualitative terms, I am sure, it has never been equaled in the world. 'Self-renewal: The Individual in the Innovative Society (New York: Harper and Row, I964). Exceptfor minor changes and deletions, this is the text of an address by ERWIN D. CANHAM, editor in chief of the "Christian Science Monitor," delivered last May at the Fourth Annual California Conference on Higher Education. 428</page><page sequence="2">AN EDITOR LOOKS AT HIGHER EDUCATION 429 I know the elite who are produced by the higher educational systems of some other countries: the Britisher who takes a First in Greats at Oxford or Cambridge and goes into the Foreign Office; the Frenchman who excels at the Ecole Normale and becomes an Inspecteur des Finances. But I also know some of the best young men and women in our own universities. I see a number of them each autumn as I serve on a Rhodes Scholarship selection committee, and I saw a number recently as I helped select the first crop of White House Fellows. They are very good young people indeed. Our educational system has not failed to produce an elite. I am aware, too, of some of the system's shortcomings. I would not obscure or deny a single one of them. But are they not in large degree shortcomings which have resulted from growth, from rising standards, from new goals, and inadequate tools for achieving them? How many of them stem from the very massiveness of our commitment? Had we not accepted such great responsibilities, we would not be so concerned today. The assertion that most of our problems are a result of the distance we have come-a product of partial fulfillment--does not signify my belief in any such thing as total fulfillment. I believe our goals will always rise. There is no top of the hill. We will not coast down the other side; not if we wish to survive as a dynamic society. We should always keep going uphill. There will always be more to do. There is no such thing as utopia. As for the Great Society: it is all very well to have great goals, but the term has too much of a utopian flavor about it for me. There must always be a greater society. With this kind of perspective, teachers must keep on renewing them- selves. They must examine their performance and learn how to do things better. They must diagnose and innovate, as they have long since been doing. I doubt if there was ever a time when the American educational system was so profoundly gripped by the forces of change, so eager to re-examine, so free from dogmatism, as it is now. Educators are learning how to organize educational systems and teach the young more effectively than ever before. Their tools and their social awareness are both steadily improving. It is all very exhilarating. YET there are some things lacking. The best way I can identify them is to describe them as moral, or even spiritual, concepts of individual and collective self-discipline. I am reminded of the sharp- tongued college teacher who said a few years ago, "Heaven help us when the permissive feeders reach the campuses." And recently an even sharper-tongued college president said in my hearing, "The permissive feeders have now reached the junior-faculty level." The relationship of many individuals to the process of higher educa- tion has changed, it seems to me, from the basic relationship that has existed for many down through the centuries in all societies. Higher education was once for most people a privilege. Now it has become a right. Once the individual had to strive hard and make many sacrifices</page><page sequence="3">430 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION to achieve it. Now it often seems to be handed to him on a silver platter. This is a simple but fundamental change. And I believe it alters the viewpoint of many teachers as well as students. In the Soviet Union, we are told, students also have a right to higher education, based primarily upon aptitudes, and entirely financed by the state. But they have also had drilled into them a sense of social or moral discipline, motivation, and obligation. How can these charac- teristics be restored in our terms in our own society? One way might be to remind ourselves of the stark realities of the world in which we live. We seem to have achieved a great deal: I have spoken of our problem as one of partial achievement. This appears to have created a sense of accomplishment, of privilege, of security. It also produces a kind of moral guilt and a challenge to security. The nihilism of our times may well stem from a feeling of unearned privilege, on the one hand, and insecurity in the face of world dangers, on the other. What will give us both challenge and security? Do we in fact need and desire a sense of security? I am not sure whether security is a good thing for individuals and a bad thing for societies, or whether it is good for either. Certainly if we are to have security, either for individuals or for society, we must have along with it a deep sense of spiritual challenge. It is in this kind of combination that security rests today, whether for man or for the community. IN THE world, peace on a large scale is preserved because of the nuclear stalemate. I need not elaborate its terms. They depend on the polarization of suicidally destructive power. Therefore power is not used in military terms-except power-in-being which preserves the peace -between the only two nations which have ultimately decisive power. Only the United States and the Soviet Union possess what is called second-strike capability-the power to strike back devastatinglv and forbiddingly after having received a first aggressive blow. The un- hampered retaliatory capacity of these two nations preserves the peace- through-fear today. Such second-strike capability is most unlikely to be achieved by third or fourth nuclear powers within the visible future. Their nuclear capacity is a nuisance and a danger. It complicates diplomacy. But it threatens massive war only if the two great powers permit themselves to be swept across the brink. This they have scru- pulously avoided doing, in crises over Berlin, Cuba and, indeed, Vietnam. It is at the levels short of total nuclear war that the great problems face us today. Limited war, such as we are waging in Vietnam, is ex- ceedingly difficult and dangerous. Our troubles in Vietnam illustrate the inconclusiveness and uncertainty of the use of conventional military force in today's world. The struggle lies deeper. And that is the point I seek to drive home: success for the goals of a free society in Vietnam, and everywhere else, depends today on elements beyond military force. It was not military force which placed North Vietnam and the Vietcong, and, indeed, Communist China, in such a favorable position.</page><page sequence="4">AN EDITOR LOOKS AT HIGHER EDUCATION 43I In Vietnam it was the shrewd, seasoned, skilled leadership of Ho Chi Minh and his generals; it was their use of guerrilla and terrorist tactics; it was their careful training of cadres of leadership down the line, both politically and paramilitarily; it was a tight and comprehensible ideology zealously believed and preached; it was the weaknesses, division, and some- times the corruption of those standing on our side. These elements have been at work not only in Vietnam; they were at work in China during the civil war, and have appeared in one form or another in many parts of today's world. Our ability to exercise leadership, even in Vietnam, now turns on elements largely apart from military force. This is the spiritual chal- lenge we face. I agree profoundly with all those who say that the first criterion of American leadership in the world today is the quality of American life. If enough Americans realized that our struggle in the world will be won or lost in terms of our social and moral discipline, motivation, and sense of obligation, perhaps we would pull ourselves together as we proceed along our path of extraordinary achievement. It is not so hard to have a sense of social discipline in times of peril or privation. It is in the age of affluence that the trouble begins. We must everlastingly remind ourselves that all we hold precious in the world is in danger. The danger of nuclear holocaust can never be dismissed, although nuclear power now perpetuates a stalemate. There- fore we should press forward toward arms limitation and control agree- ments which would stabilize this power and foreclose its abuse. But the dangers which could sweep our society over the brink of disintegration are far short of nuclear. One of them is an acceptance of unfulfillable obligations around the world. We drifted into the Vietnam mess. We must extricate ourselves from it. We can feel successful in South Vietnam only when the non-Communist Vietnamese display the qualities of strength and cohesion and order which Ho Chi Minh has imposed and evolved in the North. Perhaps this is impossible. Essen- tially it was this wily revolutionary and his associates-not the Chinese Communists or the Soviets-who produced the favorable position there. They were aided, of course, by the disintegrative forces and mistakes of our friends and allies, as well as by those for which we were responsible. H OW can we best aid the forces which would strive to combat com- munism in many parts of the world? For one thing-and this applies particularly in Vietnam-I believe we should try to abandon the role of an alien, white, big power invading a small nation and interven- ing in a struggle between brothers. Communism almost invariably works through nationals of the country concerned. There have been no Russians and very few Chinese in North Vietnam, although the Chinese "volunteers" may some day be entering the fray. This is not typical. Communism works through nationals. So should we. This is one of the most powerful arguments in favor of withdrawing from Vietnam just as</page><page sequence="5">432 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION soon as it can be done on tolerable terms. White forces in the Congo are a major calculated risk. It is regrettable that we have to maintain any American military forces in Korea. Our invasion, like that of the Com- munists, should be in the form of ideas and techniques, of training, technology, and ideology. The United States image-what the United States stands for-is not what it should be in the world. Despite the incredible contribution of our substance and our talents which we have given so freely to many parts of the world in the last two decades, the United States has been put into the posture of an alien, intrusive, pseudo-colonialist force. We need not seek gratitude, which is a fragile emotion at best, but we need understanding. The Peace Corps is a "presence" which seems to be doing a great deal of good. Mlany American technical advisers, operating discreetly, have done wonders. We have to try to prevent military collapse in the soft spots around aggressive communism, but in many places the American presence must be much more discreet. In many instances, it will be better to bring natives of countries to the United States-as we have done extensively-than it will be to send and maintain Americans there. The essence of the situation is that we have tried to make over the world much too fully, much too ambitiously, and with too little under- standing of the real problems. The power of the free idea must do more speaking for itself through the lips and in the thought patterns of the peoples striving for their freedom. Our version of freedom is not theirs. It is not attainable in our terms for most of them. We cannot solve such peoples' problems for them. We cannot keep them from making mistakes. They are children who have come of age, many of them with very ancient inherited cultures and concepts far anteceding our own. They must do their own adapting to the modern world. Anthony Eden said in Boston recently that the United States should not strive to be all things to all men. Perhaps we have attempted too much. Walter Lippmann is urging retrenchment these days, in the face of European resurgence and the development of the Chinese power structure. He feels that the lesser Asian states around the fringe of the Chinese empire will be better off without our immediate intervention in their affairs than with it. His Herald-Tribune colleague Joe Alsop regards this as rank and tragic appeasement. But in terms of the reassessment of American values and commit- ments which I have been discussing, it seems to me timely to reconsider and understand the terms of coexistence that are available to us in the world. There may never be true coexistence-a genuine armistice-but the struggle between the free system and the police state can take many forms. Certainly Communism in the Soviet Union and in eastern Europe has experienced drastic changes in the last two decades-changes almost as striking as those that have been taking place in the Western world and in the underdeveloped countries.</page><page sequence="6">AN EDITOR LOOKS AT HIGHER EDUCATION 433 W ITH more clearly defined and more limited international objec- tives, perhaps we could concentrate effectively on our task of strengthening American purpose in the nation and in the world through the educational process. Beneath all the divergences, the dangers, the miscalculations, alongside our remarkable social achievements and the resurgence of the Western world there lie integrative elements which are very closely related to the educational process. The implications of our new scientific-technological culture are today the most powerful forces in the world. Behind the fa?ade of political and ideological differences is an acceptance of certain principles applying to men's relationship to their total physical environment which are powerfully unifying. After some aberration, it has been seen that there is no such thing as "communist" science or "democratic" science or "capitalistic" science. Political and economic structures have a great effect on the application of science and technology. We believe, with good reason, that our system is more capable of applying scientific truth effectively, of carrying out basic principles, than are the totalitarian order and the police state. But behind the political and ideological dif- ferences lie the scientific principles which, more and more, are universally accepted. It is important to realize that these principles, together with their technological application, have a deeply spiritual component and base. If we define God correctly, getting away from the anthropomorphic concept of the superbeing, the benign and bearded figure on the throne, we see Him as Principle, or Mind, or Truth, or Life. Such a conception of God applies scientific principles. And in those terms, religion in its most profound sense becomes universal. In other respects, too, the new sweep of science and technology unifies society and leads it toward spiritual goals. For example, the potentialities of science and technology today exemplify and implement men's dominion over the whole earth. This is essentially a spiritual triumph, a proof of man's God-given capa- bilities, for they stem from Mind and Truth. The newly perceived scientific and technological knowledge also evokes and expresses a grow- ing sense of social responsibility. This, too, is a spiritual awareness. Thus-and I have only touched on the elements of unity underlying our many disunifying appearances-there are numerous factors drawing mankind together that will in all probability ultimately transcend the innumerable elements of disunity. This is not to dismiss blandly these elements of disunity-they are exceedingly challenging. They can do grievous harm before they are controlled. If we understand and exemplify and articulate in our educational system the integrative elements now emerging, we can, however, count on vast dynamism and power in the principles by which we are striving to live. The plain fact is that ours is the true revolution-not just our American system, but the composite set of principles and practices which we call the Western way of life, but which incidentally owes much- particularly in religion-to the East. This true revolution in which we participate has been taking shape for two milleniums and more. It is the</page><page sequence="7">434 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION stream of history, catching up the experience and insight of the Greeks and Romans, the Judaeo-Christian religion and polity, the rebirth of modern Europe, the growth of constitutionalism, the harnessing of the forces of freedom in the New World. These magnificent principles have set people free. They are setting people free individually every day. Marxism is a form of despotic, tyrannical control, rooted in the police state and denying the true status of the individual. In its essential denial of the individual and its glori- fication of the state, it is as old as all despotisms. Our forms will not suit the needs of many other peoples. But our underlying principles do. They must be adapted, shaped, understood, and activated by the emergent peoples themselves. Their contagious dynamic in the world will be effective only to the degree that we are true to these principles ourselves. That is why a speedier and more complete solution of the civil rights problem in the United States is perhaps our most urgent challenge if we are to be a leader and an ex- ample for freedom-seeking humanity everywhere. That is why the general quality of American life-its dedication to spiritual goals, to true values and excellence-and its expression through the educational system, are so important as the gloss of materialism and conspicuous consumption casts a pall over our image before hungry, necessitous nations and peoples. The American image in the world can shine no more brightly than its reality. It is obscured today by misunderstanding and by mischievous propaganda. It is blurred by many of our own actions. What we mean to mankind today is more important than our military men or our money. We must not become discouraged and frustrated at this time of extensive accomplishment. Self-renewal, to return to John Gardner's challenging term, is the requirement and the process of a society constantly in growth. It is useful to remind ourselves, in these days of self-examination, of what revolutionary changes have taken place within our own society in the last two decades. Some social scientists are saying that the twentieth century really began in 1945: that the two wars and the interregnum were but the liquidation of the nineteenth century. However we use our dates, certainly the last two decades have seen more unexpected and sensational change within this nation and in some other parts of the world than any time in history. We continue to be held in the grip of great issues, facing great decisions. The nature of American life and the scope of American responsibilities in the world are being re-examined and redefined. The educator's task is to awaken, to identify, to clarify. Out of the leavening processes of these days-processes which are often upsetting, and, like all yeast, sometimes smell-I believe it is within our capacity to find new strengths and fulfill new duties.</page></plain_text>
