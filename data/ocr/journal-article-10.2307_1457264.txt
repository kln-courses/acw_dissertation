<plain_text><page sequence="1">Teaching the Fourth Gospel LAURA H. WILD* NTRODUCTION. The Fourth Gospel is said to be "one of the greatest books ever written, if not the greatest," and the writer one of "great insight and genius." It has been the best loved of all the gospels and has offered inspiration and comfort to a host of people throughout the Christian era. Why is this? Understood for many years as a historical record of the words and deeds of Jesus written down by the disciple John, its contents have been taken as a literal, factual picture supplementing the other three gospels. Yet there is such discrepancy historically between them that for some time a "Harmony of the Gospels" has omitted this one and criti- cal study has revealed an entirely different setting and purpose. Undoubtedly written at the end of the first century A.D. after the churches had spread throughout the Roman world its style reflects that of the Alexandrian school of writers and its occasion was to confute a mixture of philosophic theories which had permeated the churches and watered down the essential gospel of Jesus. This writer had the insight to separate those confusing ideas and the gen- ius to so express the Christian truth that it has laid hold of the imagination and conscience of disciples of whatever race or cultural back- ground ever since his day. But to grasp its full meaning and its intent one needs to realize that this is the gospel of experience. Jesus had been dead some seventy years or more and yet his living spirit had been working in his followers and as they had honestly tried to obey his teaching and imitate his way of life they had discovered much more of its depth of meaning and creative power than the earliest disciples could comprehend or express. Its value had been tested in the crucible of ex- perience and experience had revealed its far- reaching results as no mere historical memory could do. Moreover, this writer's thinking had admitted to that crucible great ideas and symbols of truth coming from other cultures than the Hebrew and thus revealed Jesus' gospel as international and interracial in scope while retaining the distinctive contribution of the Hebrew mind. Thus the Fourth Gospel rewards all who ponder it carefully. It has done so in the past when its true literary char- acter was not understood and it does so es- pecially today when the student realizes more accurately what the author was trying to do and the style of writing he employed to accomplish his purpose. The following books of reference will be helpful: The Christian Epic and The Fourth Gospel and the Life of Today by Mary Ely Lyman; The Gospel of John by Benjamin Rob- inson; The Literature of the New Testament by E. F. Scott; and especially The Mission and Message of Jesus, by Major, Manson and Wright for both discussion of structure and authorship and also commentary on the text; Readings in St. John's Gospel by Archbishop Temple, while conservative, is helpful in spir- itual exposition. Preface. A preliminary lecture concerning date, authorship and background is necessary. A brief synopsis should be given of the Gnostic heresies, the influence of eastern religions upon Greek thought, the literary style of the Alexandrian school, the use of allegory in this gospel as compared with the parables of the Synoptics, and the historical basis of incidents and miracles. The lack of systematic, logical arrangement such as our modem trained minds expect is apparent, but a single thread runs through it all showing the living spirit of Jesus as present and creative in all disciples.

The purpose of the book is to show the way to the realization of Eternal Life, but the teacher should keep the full discussion of Immortality in abeyance until the end, then using the evi- dence as presented in the author's illustrations of creative power in this life. This intro- ductory material should not take too long, the teacher being so familiar with it that he can condense the essentials and present them briefly. The critical study of background and style should take its proper place and not loom so large that it obscures the message and purpose of the book. 1. The Prologue. A preface announcing the theme of the entire book, "the Relation of Time to Eternity." The Greek logos stands for "the reasonable order which rules in the world and holds it together," the vital energizing principle. The Hebrew imrah or "Word" means "the vehicle of divine activity" or the spoken, personal expression of. God, his essen- tial spirit existing from the beginning and finding concrete expression in Jesus. There should be a discussion of God as Mind (com- pare recent declarations of scientists) and God as Person, including more than mere reason. Clear distinction should be made between anthropomorphic and spiritual conceptions. God's simplest expression of himself, this author says, was made through the personality of Jesus. The Man Christ Jesus, by John Knox,c ould be used advantageously, also as illustration Helen Keller's awakening to the meaning of things through the word "water" which she identified with the stream flowing over her hand. Jesus is such a "word" intro- ducing us to the meaning of life in the simplest way we as persons can understand.? In v. 3 the unity of the universe is declared, What is it that holds the universe together? Is it mere force, mere mind, or something greater? Comparison can be drawn between Plato's "allegory of the den" and Plotinus' advance in philosophy.2 In wv. 4 and 5 the person Jesus is Light expelling Darkness. Darkness is negative resulting in death; light produces life. This is the first great figure the author uses to explain Jesus. Jesus is the incarnation of the Light of Life. The incarna- tion in whatever sense taken is the most wonderful truth the history of man reveals (v. 9). But the teacher must refrain from too lengthy and detailed discussion of this doctrine of the preexistence versus mere messiahship of Jesus, for the aim of this book is to proclaim the actual experience of the Spirit of Christ in men whatever the explanation of the origin or ap- pearance of that spirit. It is done by illustra- tions rather than argumentation. 2. Jesus as Light, Illumination, "I am the Light of the World," (9/5). Point out the oratorical use of "I am." Refer to the Zoroastrian teaching of Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, and the Satanic use of the medium of darkness. Today whether we are monists or dualists, facts stare us in the face showing the dark clouds of death and destruc- tion spread by evil thoughts lodged in persons. Discuss the mystics' use of the word "illumina- tion." Is that the way we are to think of Jesus as an illuminated person? Discuss the academic use of the word "enlightenment" and the student's experience when he says "I see" after puzzling over some problem. Is there fundamental truth in both of these aspects of the function of personality? Is Thomas Kelly right when he says "in the X-ray of Eternity we may be given to see the dark spots of life"? Refer to the chapter, "The Light Within," in A Testament of Devotion, and Evelyn Underhill's "Light of Christ." The prologue says Jesus' "life was the light of men" and "there (in him) was the true light which lighteth every man." Discuss 3/21, "he that doeth the truth cometh to the light," and the relationship of truth anywhere to be found, scientific investigation or personal experience, to enlightenment. Discuss the experience of John the Baptist (5/35) as "a lamp that burn- eth and shineth" and the assertion '"I am the light of the world" (8/12, 12/46) with the reference to John in 1/6-8. A John the Bap- tist sect had adherents but that light was like a</page><page sequence="3">28 LAURA H. WILD candle in a very limited room compared to the bright light of heaven illuminating the whole earth. The Blind Man (ch. 9), one of the outstand- ing stories illustrating the enlightenment that comes to man through the teaching of Jesus. Is this mere allegory, or based on some inci- dent? (See Mk. 8/23, 10/48). Note that it is one of the seven miracles peculiar to this gospel. The question introducing the story is, where does the responsibility lie for handicaps and afflictions in men's lives? Does it rest on the one afflicted or on one's ancestors? Refer to the famous saying in Ex. 20/5, which psychia- trists quote today. But they remove blame and rub out sin. Is that the way Jesus freed men from the load of past mistakes? Are German youth responsible for their twisted minds and the darkness they walk in? Are they to be condemned as sinners? What is sin anyway? In this story Jesus rubs sin off the slate in the sense of condemnation for our inherited tendencies and blindness. The judg- ment or condemnation is upon those who refuse to come to the light (vv. 39-41). In studying the way Jesus made the man see (vv. 6, 7, 10, 11), of course, the question of "faith cure" will come up. If this is allegory, that can be disposed of without too lengthy a discussion and without refuting "faith cure" in toto. Note that saliva was considered very effectual in curing blindness, Latin writers referring to it. Jesus used what faith he could lay hold of to make the man see. We all have to be approached by some phrase or act that "gets us" just where we are. That is what makes the student wake up and say "0, Isee." But note that the man's attention passed on from the method of the cure to Jesus himself and his confidence in him became so strong that he didn't care what his relatives or the public authorities said, because he believed in the power of Jesus' personality. Here the contrast is made very vivid between stubborn adherence to inherited dogma and hearty acceptance of an experience not fully under- stood. His only explanation was the power inherent in such a man as Jesus. Here it may be necessary to discuss whether people are really Christians who merely theorize on the basis of dogma without experience, and what is the basis of agreement of the many sects differing as to dogma. Also what is the relation of intellectual perception to experience and devotion, how escape sentimentalism if we neglect the intellect or the barrenness of mere intellectualism if we have no experi- ence? What about "the rescue and support coming to our help right down in the jungle of life"? How does it come? 3. Born Again, the figure of the wind (ch. 3). In biblical poetry as in all poetry, spir- itual experiences are symbolized by the natural elements and the touch of God's Spirit on man is compared to his breath, elsewhere as "a rushing mighty wind." Attention should be called to the idea of rebirth in mystery religions and the mixture of philosophies at the time of the writing of the Fourth Gospel. Nicodemus represents an intelligent man, a teacher, who ponders upon this idea. "How can it be?" he says. Some explanations were very super- stitious, but here Jesus asserts the necessity of being born "anew," "from above," a spiritual rebirth reaching beyond the ceremonial rites of drinking milk to induce childlikeness or believ- ing that. something magical happens when one is baptized. Jesus was talking of a spiritual renewal deeper than mere repentance for out- ward acts. ,A purification of one's conduct is necessary, but a change of spiritual atti- tude is essential, a starting anew on a higher level by a power not emanating from one- self but from God's Spirit. "How can these things be?" To make it clear, Jesus drew the analogy to a natural process, the move- ment of the wind, and challenges Nicodemus, "Art thou a teacher and understandeth not these things?" This is conversation between two teachers on the rational level. Today the teacher of religion draws upon analogies in scientific research in the world of Nature, the same laws applying in the spiritual realm. Finally theauthor comments on the character of God as a God of Love revealing himself</page><page sequence="4">TEACHING THE FOURTH GOSPEL 29 through Jesus, as much a fact as that of the atmosphere and the wind in the physical world. The Man Who Couldn't Get into the Bath (ch. 5). The writer precedes a dissertation on how faith in Jesus can cure men of their ills by an everyday story of a poor man of the depressed class, constantly out of luck, never succeeding in getting into the pool because others push ahead of him and no one helps him. If one of his family should come to take him home at night, he would complain that fate is against him. "What's the use?" he would say, reproaching the selfishness and unfriendliness of the whole world. He would sink into sullen despair until his relatives would give him up as hopeless. Yet he kept going to the pool with a spark of hope not quite dead. This story tells how the man was put on his feet by a friend who believed in his possibilities, who told him to say "I can" in- stead of "I can't," who told him to use his own strength and try. This is a lesson in the technique of cure. The psychiatrist uses it today, but too often without the aid of re- ligious faith and the assurance of divine help. The dissertation which follows shows that the power of Jesus lay in his own dependence upon divine creative power. He could help be- cause he, a man in the flesh, had the spirit of the Father of love (vv. 26, 27), a more effective power than that of those who try to help by simply pointing to man's sin and the punish- ment of divine wrath (v. 36). Note that the objections to the cure then were the same as today, that the method was not correct and that the healer was not backed up by accepted authority. But Jesus didn't care, he did his work and "slipped away" (v. 13). Note also the connection here with the question "What must we do?" in 6/28 and the difference be- tween mere belief and faith as commitment in action. The intellectual difficulty of Nico- demus is here supplemented by the practical difficulty of a poor, unprivileged man. In either case commitment to a new idea, acting upon it, produces evidence of its truth. The teacher should explain the long history of this pool of Siloam, harking back to Isaiah's day, and the traditional belief concerning it. He might use effectively Arthur Clough's poem "Bethesda." Do we today fall back and say "I must do as other men are doing?" See also Richard Burton's "The Song of the Un- successful." An analogy could be drawn to such shrines as that at Lourdes and St. Anne of Beauprd. 4. Bread and Water. "I am the bread of life." "He that believeth on me shall never thirst" (6/35, 48). The figure of nourishment and refreshment. The author is writing of the life of the spirit. Bread and water are neces- sary for sustenance. Nourishment is neces- sary for our spiritual existence, otherwise we starve and die. The illustration preceding these statements is the feeding of the 5,000 in the desert. This teaching is called "the heart of the gospel," and the story of the loaves and fishes is one of the two most popular subjects in art, the other one the "water made wine." Why is this? Details in this gospel differ somewhat from those in the Synoptics. The main difference is that it is Jesus who distributes the bread and he who realized the hunger of the people and after they are fed they recognize his unique personality, his relationship to God. Note that Jesus makes use of the ordinary things of life to feed men's hunger, takes the little boy's lunch, showing how caring and shar- ing accomplishes wonders.3 This gospel elab- orates Jesus' secret of power due to his relation- ship to God as a son to a father. The sustenance he offers doesn't give out, is lasting because it comes from God. But such service to men is sacrificial service, placing spiritual life before the physical (v. 51). Verses 52-58 are supposed to refer to discussion in the church of that day concerning the significance of the Eucharist. This is a good place to explain the three historic ideas concerning it. Chapter 4/1 , 2 shows the contrast between Jesus and John the Baptist in depending upon a rite. In chapter 13, this author omits many details of the Lord's Supper and centers attention on the inner meaning. Scholars think the churches had fallen into a worship of the rite</page><page sequence="5">30 LAURA H. WILD rather than its real significance, especially as this is definitely mentioned in the Epistle to the Hebrews written about this time. The Woman at the Well (ch. 4). The his- toric setting should be explained, why the schism in worship arose between the half- breed Samaritans and the blue-blooded Jews of Jerusalem. A modern parallel is the schism between the F.F.V's ("First Families of Vir- ginia") riding in Pullman comfort and the negroes in "Jim Crow" cars or the "poor white trash" barred from polite recognition. "The Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans." Note how the woman shies away from blame of her conduct and how Jesus turns the con- versation from the outward and physical to the inner spirit and living water, the creative, ever-refreshing fountain of life, the "well of water springing up into eternal life." Note the eagerness of a person caught in "the jungle of life" to seize upon the hope of an experience more satisfying and lasting than she had ever known. Dwell on the famous definition of true religion (vv. 23, 24), its relation to the sincere search for truth not wrapped in sealed cartons of custom and belief but found in the creative, living spirit. The epilogue to this story reveals how the power of such a spirit silences criticism and spreads the wonderful discovery. Ch. 7 again brings out conven- tional criticisms and reiterates the spiritual truth underneath this story (vv. 37-39). The Water Made Wine (ch. 2). Again one of the seven miracles given in this gospel alone. Was there a historic basis? Discuss the diffi- culties in taking it literally. If symbolical, what is its meaning? People in that region were accustomed to poor water kept in cis- terns. Springs were prized. The Old Testa- ment is full of references to the value placed on good, refreshing water and on wine as a substitute (Is. 55/1). Wine was not only refreshing but exhilarating and tasted good. If the wine failed at a feast the water kept in jars for washing the dust of one's feet was no substitute. The host would be immensely relieved to find more wine produced from some- where, even better than the first serving. So the picture is drawn of Jesus' ability to hand to those having faith in him a kind of life tasting good and sparkling with joy. 5. Friendship. What it means. (chs. 10 and 15). The Good Shepherd (ch. 10). A very famil- iar figure, often used in both Old and New Testaments. Sheep need a caretaker really concerned for the good of the sheep, so much so that he sacrifices himself for their welfare. The prophets denounced false shepherds look- ing out for their own interests only. This story calls them selfish thieves. Here is the picture of Jesus as one who truly cares for men just as God is represented in Psalm 23. The synoptists dwell upon the sheep and their need, their getting lost when left to themselves. This writer emphasizes the character of the shepherd and the security given the sheep through unselfish concern. Love is not men- tioned here except in calling attention to the relationship of Jesus to God, but the proof of love is demonstrated by caring. In 15/13 the extent to which real love goes is clearly stated as a principle of life, that of friendship. Such caring is not merely for a comfortable existence but for the full possibilities of life abundant, and God is represented through Jesus as taking the initiative in such concern (also in 3/16). Thompson's "Hound of Heaven" might well be used here. "The ultimate mystery is favorable to us," says Evelyn Underhill.4 It is such confidence which gives men a feeling of security, enabling them to enter the door of privilege and abundant life.5 To know the universe as friendly, to know God as a friend, opens up to our imagination a marvellous vista of possibilities, of a life not confined to physical surroundings (cf. 17/3). Freedom in Friendship. This kind of love is voluntarily given (10/18, 15/15). It is not a bondage because not required, yet there are principles governing it. Ch. 15 stresses the necessity of obedience to the highest we know. Have we found the Truth? "The truth shall make you free" (8/32), truth which gives us confidence so that we can trust the ultimate mystery of life. But we need to follow the</page><page sequence="6">TEACHING THE FOURTH GOSPEL 31 Shepherd who leads the way (10/3-5), must be sensitive to his voice, must turn and follow. The Good Shepherd gives liberty to explore the pasture for ourselves, to discover new things on our own, only we must come back at night listening to his call. The teacher may well refer to Emerson's essay on Friendship. "It requires rare and costly natures. It is fit for serene days and graceful gifts and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty and persecution". Friendship means caring and response, under- standing and more caring and deeper under- standing, increasing knowledge, increasing se- curity, increasing freedom, and a loyalty that never fails if the weather be smooth or rough. 6. The Vine (ch. 15), symbol of the law of Life. God chooses us, desires us, and we choose God, desire him enough to stay with him. From such communion of spirit the cre- ative, life-giving power flows through us as sap from the roots to the branches of the vine. This is an inescapable law of life. Its in- evitable working is shown by dead branches and lack of fruit when such communion is absent and joyful life with luscious fruit when present. The "commandment" is not arbi- trary but simply the truth of life. Fruitbearing. The individual's growth and happiness is not the whole of the gospel. The social gospel is its complement. Personality is essentially social and must find social ex- pression. This Fourth Gospel is called mysti- cal, but mysticism rightly understood is not impractical. The true mystic does not stay with his head in the clouds; his feet are on the earth, his personal contacts and earthly sur- roundings are the medium for his growth. Right here rests the promise of a never-ending progress, a consciousness of eternal life. "This is life eternal to know Thee, the only true God, and him whom Thou didst send, Jesus Christ" (17/3). In other words, life itself depends not only upon individual communion with God, but passing on the knowledge as God himself communicates it through Jesus. God is socially dynamic. Ethics as the expression of the inner spirit in touch with God and re- ceiving inspiration from a source beyond itself is different from the expression of mere human nature, even at its best, which often goes astray, losing its power, becoming in the end a-moral or downright immoral and finally fruitless. True ethics is like the branch drawing its sap from the vine and bearing much fruit. Culti- vation of the inner life is therefore basic and ethical expression the natural result. To re- verse the process is to contradict eternal law and produce a man-made philosophy short- sighted and selfishly prejudiced. Intimate knowledge of God places time in its right rela- tion to eternity, freeing man from bondage to human opinions. Therefore in v. 9 the ne- cessity of abiding in God's love is stressed. The need for social expression is emphasized again in 21/15-17 when Jesus charges Peter if he really loves him to feed the sheep, stating figuratively a law of friendship and a law of life. Notice that in these verses two Greek words are used for love, agapaj by Jesus and philej by Peter. The latter used the word meaning an emotional personal affection, while Jesus spoke of a more selfless devotion, a more deliberate expression. In social experience one passes from the more individual to the more inclusive. The Discipline of the Spirit. The figure of the vine is developed to show the steps in spiritual growth. Dead timber must be cut away. Branches not receiving the sap of life, bearing only showy leaves or bitter fruit must be pruned. The pruning proces is not pleas- ant to one's self-complacency, it hurts one's pride but life's hurts can be received in such a way as to enhance the vigor and power of the personality. This seems the import of these verses pointing to Jesus as having met the severest hurts of life in such a way as to reveal the difference between the life-giving spirit of love and the shrivelling, deadening spirit of selfishness and hate. In v. 22 Jesus arouses the recognition of sin in this contrast. As we gaze on him, the filial son of the Father of Love, we see the ugliness and littleness of selfishness and hate (vv. 20-24).</page><page sequence="7">32 LAURA H. WILD 7. The Holy Spirit (ch. 16). Much theolog- ical discussion has centered about this chap- ter, but to dwell on mere intellectual argu- mentation concerning the doctrine of the Trin- ity is far afield from what this writer is doing. He is trying to show that the Spirit in Jesus persists as "Helper" even after his spirit left the body. We must "remember" what he taught, but also realize that his spirit is living in the world to convict it of the wrongness of self-centered littleness and the rightness of the true relation of a son to God as Father. This conviction or "judgment" is the judgment of truth and this Spirit is the vital spirit of cre- ative life guiding men into greater truth as such guidance is accepted. Then follows an increasingly enlarged vision of what this uni- verse means, of what God's character is as Father of mankind. To stop at the point of lamenting over the death of Jesus is to block the progress of God's Spirit in the world. We may have confidence of more and more en- lightenment if we desire it and pray for it in the same spirit Jesus possessed. This is the plain teaching of Jesus, the author says, and this result, gained by experience rather than philosophizing, is the proof of the divineness of his message, giving joy and cheer to anyone laying hold of it. This author is a pragmatist. Christian experience establishes the truth of the teaching. 8. The Intercessory Prayer (ch. 17). Here the writer puts into the mouth of Jesus the truths he has just been talking about, dra- matically picturing him in prayer. How would he pray? This is "The Prayer of our Lord." The so-called "Lord's Prayer" is the prayer he taught his disciples at the beginning of their discipline as his followers. Here the hallowing of God's name is vividly pictured in Jesus' own attitude at the close of his life. The fact is reiterated that progressive eternal life depends on knowing God the Father as the truth behind everything, that glorifying God rather than man is the true end of our ex- istence. Jesus has represented the true God and he prays that those who have begun to see may be kept loyal and guarded from the evil influences in the world, that the hard things they meet may be accepted as the discipline that "consecrates" them more and more to the truth. He prays that from them this spirit may spread throughout the world. This is his gospel, that the Spirit of Love emanating from God, exhibited in his life, may spread from one to another of the human personalities God has created, bringing righteousness and joy. The prayer is a masterly summary of the whole teaching and example of Jesus. Much has been written concerning the meaning of intercession. One may well note that in this model of intercessory prayer Jesus' whole desire is that men may become conscious of and kept in the presence of God as Love, not that they may be taken away from the hard things they must meet, even hate, but that they may be kept from a wrong spirit in themselves. 9. Immortality. The rest of the book deals with the death and resurrection of Jesus, the relation of life in the body to the life of the spirit, of time to eternity. As was stated at the beginning this is the theme of the book and here is the climax. Now can well be con- sidered the story of the resurrection of Lazarus (ch. 11) . Of course the question of the lit- eralness or allegorical character of the narrative will come to the fore. Note that this event is given only in this gospel, also that the current beliefs of the mystery religions were very familiar to people living in Asia Minor, and the belief of the more intellectual of the Roman world that faith in an immanent spirithelped men to be stoical and face the worst. Also in 11/24 Martha represents the belief of an in- fluential group of Jews. This story is tied up with what has already been said of Jesus as bringing enlightenment, of his awakening people to see the true light (vv. 9-11,37). The utter discouragement even of disciples is shown in Thomas, longing like Job to get out of this dark night of existence. The way out of the mugginess and confusion of Martha's thinking and the black despair of Thomas is through the attitude of Mary who adored her Master as lord of life and believed he had re-</page><page sequence="8">TEACHING THE FOURTH GOSPEL 33 vivifying power in every situation. In v. 35 is shown Jesus' deep sympathy with the anguish earthly life can hold and in vv. 40f the light he can bring as to the character of God and his working in the spirits of men when they let him. Chapter 14 may well be introduced here in anticipation of Jesus' own death. In ch. 18 Jesus himself meets death. The value of Jesus' teaching is not that it is mere teaching but a way of life he himself demon- strated by experience (cf. 14/6). He was asked to declare his doctrine (v. 19) and re- fused to argue about it pointing to its effect in men as the evidence of its truth, and the spirit with which they met the hate and death- dealing actions of men as a declaration of the eternal God. Here is the answer to Pilate's famous query "What is truth?" Attention should be called to the differences between the Johannine and the Synoptic accounts of both the crucifixion and the resurrection. This study will necessarily in- volve a discussion of the theories of physical and spiritual resurrection, but attention should not be so centered on those arguments that the core and climax of this whole gospel is missed, namely the continuous, revivifying spirit of the Father of Love as it was shown in one who had a Son's attitude. First, the significance of Jesus' conversation with Peter in ch. 13 should be pointed out, the humble act of washing a man's dusty feet, the example for all who would follow the Master, the distressing and inharmonious spirit of Judas and Jesus' reiteration of the saving principle of love which reveals the glory of God, and the crucial test of giving one's life for love's sake. The puzzling question of death and separation from the loved one is introduced in ch. 14 and as Jesus faced the final events in his life his declaration is made more real that the spiritual world is dominant and can be reached even through the veil of death. In chs. 18 and 19 the secret of the calm, assured manner in which Jesus met his enemies and his fate at their hands is attributed to his knowledge that he belongs in a cosmic order, a kingdom not limited by this world (18/36) which he has been trying to make clear to them before his own crisis overtook him (ch. 14), a truth which his disciples must grasp if they are to under- stand him and his teaching. Otherwise every man will become cynical like Pilate. The loving thought of Jesus for his mother even in the midst of his own anguish, his tender tone as he addresses Mary, the eagerness of the beloved disciple in outrunning Peter, the assurance given Thomas the doubter, the peaceful spirit which came upon the disciples as their minds were opened to the fact of eternal life-these vivid narratives are peculiar to this gospel. This writer expressly says he has not tried to give a complete picture of what Christ did, but that he has presented the truth Jesus came to reveal so that men would believe it-and would through him find the real mean- ing of life, immortal life. The proof of the truth is the experience of his followers in trying to live the way Jesus lived. "I am the Way and the Truth and the Life." This is the wit- ness of the Fourth Gospel, the witness of experience. REFERENCES 1The teacher of course should be familiar with the various theories of the Incarnation and the significance of the word logos as here used. But some such illustra- tion as this should be used for the undergraduate student, a figure simple enough to be grasped by the beginner and yet large enough to hold an expanding thought of the meaning of Jesus' life. If someone wishes to delve into the theological theories a brief, clear presentation is given in John Knox's Christ the Lord, but do not let him miss the vital meaning in trying to disentangle the arguments. 2 See Men who Have Walked with God, by Sheldon Cheney for a brief statement.
