Jd.UUd.Ly until early 1916. These include some remarkably clear images of considerable ethnographic interest. The only information accompanying the collection is a brief description of each of the images and a copy of a letter dated June 1972 from the donor, Mrs Edith Saxton of Melbourne, which explains that the pho toeraohs were made bv her brother, Ernest Sterne Usher. An inquiry to the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages in Melbourne enabled us to contact Edith Saxton's sons. They provided some biographical information, but no diaries or letters have been located. However, it was established that Usher went to Papua to work with a Government-sponsored oil exploration team led by Dr Arthur Wade. This pro ,mtu LAiV- w ""wv ^rivu official reports held in the Australian Archives in Canberra. Inquiries sent to a colleague in Port Moresby resulted in a copy of a newspaper notice of Usher's death. To date, this is the full extent of the archival sources identified for Usher. There are no written statements by him that explain why he took these photographs.2 The Collection The majority of the photographs were taken by Usher while he was working as a Surveyor and Assistant Geologist with an oil exploration team in the Vailala-Purari region of the eastern Papuan Gulf. A fnrrlipr 82 nrinrç annpar rn rlerivp from nhn tographs taken in Papua by Evan R. Stanley, Papuan Government Geologist, and 24 prints of pho tographs taken in Australia by Leonard Langdale Wrathall, both of whom were members of the oil exploration team. Also included in the Usher Collection are 33 post cards of Milne Bay and Trobriand Islands produced Curator of Foreign Ethnology, South Australian Museum Usher in Papua by W.H. Cooper of the Royal Arcade, Melbourne, twelve others of Papua printed in England for the Papuan Times Ltd, and 52 of the Solomon Islands produced by the Tasmanian photographer John Watt Beattie. Some of the Papuan Gulf images are similar to chose that were taken by Frank Hurley in the same region five years later (Specht and Fields 1984). Other early collections of photographs taken in the eastern Gulf region are those by ► A.B. Lewis in 1912 while collecting ror rield Museum of Natural History in Chicago; • E.W.P. Chinnery in 1916, a Papuan Government Resident Magistrate in the area, whose pho tographs are held by his daughters in Melbourne; ■ Paul Wirz in 1930, who carried out anthropological research in the region and whose photographs are held by the Museum fiir Volkerkunde in Basel, Switzerland; * F.E. Williams, Government Anthropologist ror Papua, during his fieldwork in the Purari region in 1922 and at Orokolo in 1931-2, whose photographs are held by the Australian Archives, Canberra, and by the South Australian Museum. Ushers early life, education and training are sum marized by Pike and Craig (1999:215-6). He arrived at Upoia on the Vailala River in January 1914. In Wade's Report on Petroleum in Papua (1915:5), it is explained that Usher and fellow surveyor J.W. Murray were to assist first in a survey west along the coast from the Vailala through to the delta of the Purari River, and then along the Papuan coastline east of the Vailala as far as Port Moresby (Figure 1). Finally they would return for further work in the Vailala-Purari area. The photographs more or less follow that sequence with a date of August 1914 for their time in Port Moresby, coinciding with a visit there by the Admiral of the Royal Australian Fleet at the outbreak of the First World War, an occasion liberally documented by Usher's camera. Back in the Purari-Vailala area, there is a 'Christmas 1915' date July 1999 27</page><page sequence="2">comprehensive record of the more public aspects of day-to-day life in the eastern Gulf at that time. Figure i. Map showing location of Vailala-Purari area of the eastern Gulf of Papua. for a Purari expedition. Around April 1916, Usher (Figure 2) went on leave to Melbourne, sailing on board the Meklong. From the sequence of the photographs, it appears that the Meklone called in at Samarai. then Herbertshôhe and Rabaul, then sailed around the north and west of New Britain to Witu or Vitu (French Islands), and then south to Mo robe on the southern shores of the Huon Gulf, then north-east to Ablingi and Lindenhafen on the south coast of New Britain, and finally due east to the Shortland Tclinrlc VpIIo T limkn TclonrJ I7n Tclinrl Russell Island, Gela (Nggela or Florida Islands), Tulagi Harbour and Guadalcanal in the Solomons. Presumably the ship then sailed directly to Brisbane and/or Sydney and Melbourne. Usher's Photographs On his arrival at Upoia, Usher immediately began his photography. He recorded on film the members of the oil exploration team, their living conditions and activities. Several of these photographs illustrate Wade's official Report (1915). However, most of the images are of the local peo pie and their way of life, the material manifestations of which have changed considerably over the past 85 years. Usher's photographs represent a relatively The terrain was easier on the geologists and sur veyors near the coast than it was inland, although the sago swamps had their characteristic difficulties. In a testimonial that Arthur Wade wrote for Usher (dated August i6th, 1914 at Port Moresby) he alludes to the type of country his surveyor had to cope with: He has a good constitution which has with stood the dangers of a trying tropical climate as well as the more trying work he has had to face in surveying lines through dense jungle [and] almost impenetrable swamp. The camps set up by the survey teams were usu ally on the fringes of, or close by, existing villages. Figure 2. Ernest Sterne Usher on board the Meklong (around April 1916?).

Multi-hulled lakatoi moored beside Ukiaravi village, Purari Delta (around Christmas 1915?). (Usher, C100) hulls. Illustrations of lakatoi were most popular in books that dealt with this part of Papua and most visitors with cameras endeavored to secure pho tographs of them. Usher recorded four views of lakatoi. The first is of the central open deck space bounded by the large four-sided shelter that has been constructed on the multi-hulled vessel. The next image shows a fully riowrl lakaroi moored off the villape ofKaimare in the Purari Delta The other two images (e.&amp;. Ficnire 5) are of a nine- or ten-hulled lakatoi moored beside Ukiaravi village in the Purari Delta, waiting for its load of saeo to be broueht in exchange for the Dots and shell ornaments it has delivered.

But life in Papua in 1914—16 was not one of work only; the people also knew how to have fun. A form of 'hockey' being played on the beach at the Vailala river mouth is shown. Fishing provided an important component in the diet of coastal villagers. In his book In Primitive New Guinea (1924:241), Holmes records: surf-fishing engaged in by young and old of lages along the coast, was done with the aid of conically shaped wicker fish-traps. Periodically shoals of a sprat-like fish named avaha were washed into the beach; their com ing was hailed with delight by everybody, and whilst they were being caught by pouncing the traps into the water, seemingly at haphaz ard, with the hope of encircling and entrap ping a few, excitement ran very high. Usher took a photograph at Ipisi village near Kerema of these conical fish-traps; he records on the back of the picture that 'the boys run rapidly through the water on seeing a fish, and bring down the basket-net over it; a hole at the top enables the fish to be got out.' He also photographed the use of a Y-shaped frame with a net stretched between the arms of the Y. This device was submerged and the fish scooped up to fall into the slack part of the net at the junction of the fork so that they could not escape. Uther photographs by Usher illustrate use of the multi-pronged fish spear and the use of bow with its stem driven at low tide into the sand.7 With the growing influence of missionaries of various nationalities and religious persuasions, tra ditional forms of clothing were supplanted by items of western dress. Usher encountered these people at a time when these changes were only just beginning. One of the strengths of Usher's photographic work is his study or groups or people in traditional attire.

Many of these groups are deliberately posed for the camera but are nevertheless important studies of dress and adornment.

However, it appears that Usher did no more than ask people to line up; he never sought to manipulate people into the roman tic poses of earlier photographers, such as Barton (Wright 1997). Occasionally, Usher also came upon episodes in the rites of passage from childhood to adulthood, eg. boys going through the 'dubu' (eravo / men's house) ceremony in Vailala village. An important Purari Delta ritual object was the roughly-woven cane 'monster' called kaiaimunu Figure 7.

The boys emerged from the ravi reborn, with glistening skin, bright shell and feather ornaments, and fore-and-aft 'ramis (Motu word for loin cloth) of bark cloth painted with rectilinear designs, young men, as Usher noted on the back of one photograph, now eligible to marry.' Usher did not have the good luck to witness the dancing of the Purari aiaimunu (or hevehe as they .1 1 1 1 . \ r 'l 1 \ wlil R.1HJW11 ai wiuivuiu, an va jcrricjc di v diidid;, tacular oval masks up to 8 meters tall.^ But he did nhntncrranh a fpw fiprl fn rhf frrmf r*f rlw^llincr hone es at Maipua and inside a ravi (Figure 7).

Lewis in May 1912 in the same ravi.10 The differ ences in the kwoi displays over a short period of only 3 years indicates something of the constantly chang ing nature of the ravis interior furnishings. Apart from his interest in the indigenous inhab itants, Usher noted the European presence on the outstations in the Gulf region, in Port Moresby (especially a magnificent six-frame panorama of the town) and at Herbertshôhe and Rabaul. He also photographed the members of the oil-search team. Une fascinating photograph shows J. W. Murray, his fellow surveyor, represented in a manner suggesting that Usher was capable of revealing the deeper nature of his subjects (compare Figures iz and 13). Many of his photographs, and in particular that of a railway through a rubber plantation on Witu Island (Figure 14), also show his interest in achiev ing nnwerfnl pffprrç rhrniiah tbp rnmnncirinn of his photographs — not by manipulating his subjects but by careful framing of what was there.

Ushers Death Ernest Sterne Usher died in Papua on 23 September 1916, not long after his return from leave. The fol lowing article appeared in The Papuan Times on the 4th October 1916: Boating Fatality News has been received of the death by drowning of Mr A [sic] Usher, surveyor to the oilfields. This gentleman has been engaged in cutting a new road at the back of Orokolo to a new bore site. Mr Usher was drowned whilst crossing the Vailala river from the west 34 Pacific Arts ern side at its mouth. There was a fresh1 in the river at the time, resulting in a very strong current. The deceased attempted to cross in a small canoe with three boys. He was warned uy UlC V llliigc V&gt;UIloLdUlC LU UUlcUIl d. lillgCI canoe, but replied that a smaller one would be quicker.

Two natives reached the shore in an exhausted condition, but the third uoy was urowneu, ana nis Doay wasnea ashore two days later. Mr Usher was extremely popular on the oil field, and only returned to the oilfields three months ago after a holiday south. The sad news of his death caused a feeling of depres sion on the field, where his many friends heard the news with the greatest regret.</page><page sequence="9">Figure 14. Rubber plantation on Witu (French) Island, New Britain (around April 1916?). (Usher, In his Monthly Report of September 1916 to the Secretary, Department of External Affairs, Melbourne, dated October 6th 1916, Dr Wade reported that: On hearing the news [of Usher's death] I went at once to make personal investigations, then closed down his camp and ensured the safety of his field work. Later, aided by his field notes and sketches I went over his recent work. It is impossible at present to estimate what a loss we have suffered by this tragic incident. Few men could ever attain the Figure 15.

We do not know exactly why Usher set about mak ing such a thorough photographic record. Was it simply curiosity? Was it a way of letting his family 1/nnTjr inrh ot kp Tiric rlnin rr? t rl In a Kiir/a rr&gt; m c f»ro nrlor purpose? 1 hese photographs join other major collections Df photographs of the colonial era that provide the data for analysis of the way Europeans have viewed tribal peoples in the Pacific (and indeed elsewhere ti,:„ » „..„u analysis but the brief notes attached to Usher's images do suggest that his attitude towards the indigenous people was positive and his aim consis tent with an ethnographic purpose of recording the appearance and activities of people still living more ar-less as their ancestors lived before Europeans :ame to work among them. This record will undoubtedly be of considerable interest to the descendants of these people and it is intended to pre sent copies of the photographs to the PNG National Museum so that the images can become accessible to them. 1. Copying of nitrate negatives and production of prints for research and exhibition was carried out by Scott Bradley, contract photographer for the South Australian Museum. 2. In all this research work I was ably assisted by Grahame Pike, who travelled to Melbourne (Victoria) andTumut (NSW) to interview Usher's nephews. He also prepared an index of the pho tographs and wrote a draft of a paper, including the Index, which has been published (Pike and Craig J999)- The staff of the Australian Archives in Canberra have been helpful in locating and pro viding copies of documents relating to the Vailala Oilfields. 3. The men's houses among the Elema speakers, living along the coast between Orokolo to the west, through the Vailala River area as far as Sepoi (near Cape Possession) to the east, are called eravo. The Namau speakers of the Purari Delta, west of the Elema, call the men's house ravi. The word dubu appears to be a Motu word applied indiscrimi nately throughout most of the Gulf and Central Districts of Papua to refer to men's club houses and/or ceremonial platforms (see Seligman 1910:17—22, 60—65,141—150). Usher was not always consistent in his use of these terms. 4. There were seven types of Motu pots (Barton in Seligman 1910:114, fn.2). 5. There were three main types of shell wealth: toia (shell armlets), mairi (pearl shells, whole or cres cent-shaped), and tautau {nassa or 'dog-whelk' necklaces). A large toia bought a 250 to 35olb pack age of sago or one asi (canoe hull); a large uro pot bought a bag of about 8olbs of sago and a small uro pot or a keikei pot bought about 4olbs of sago (Barton in Seligman 1910:115). 6. These Y-framed nets were used also by Trobriand Islanders (Young 1998, Plates 75,76). 7. This became a popular image of the Papuan fisher man early in the century (eg. Holmes 1924, book cover). 8. The South Australian Museum has 27 glass plate negatives and one nitrate negative of photographs taken by EE. Williams in Orokolo, mostly during ) 6 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="11">his fieldwork in 1931-32.
