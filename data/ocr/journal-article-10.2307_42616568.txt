ANGEL In the spring of 1938, Lawren S. Harris (1885-1970) and his second wife, Bess, drove more than 3,000 kilometres through ten states and over half the North American continent to relocate in Santa Fe, a sand-blown city renowned for its ethereal light and mystic landscapes.1 The couple made the move from Hanover, New Hampshire, where they had lived for four years after leaving Toronto in 1934. The Harrises' relocation is an event that has been chronicled as happenstance: the couple arrived in the Southwestern city while on a motor holiday and liked it so much they decided to stay.2 This account, however, seems unlikely. Aside from the extensive distance that the pair drove to reach their new home - much more an epic journey than a leisurely jaunt - it is hard to imagine that Harris, a man whose life was characterized by precise planning and actions, would have commenced such an ambitious expedition without a fixed destination. This paper explores what was arguably a key motivating factor behind the Harrises' move to the Southwest: his interest in the American painter Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986), who from 1929 onward lived part of every year in Abiquiú, just outside of Santa Fe, as one of the area's most celebrated residents.3 Since 1984 when Roald Nasgaard proposed a connection between the paintings of Harris and O'Keeffe and argued that both manifest transcendental symbolist content, scholars have drawn parallels between the work of these two artists who painted concurrently and shared an interest in forging an indigenous response to European modernism.4 Echoing Nasgaard's view, Michael D. Hall and Nannette V. Maciejunes situate Harris, along with O'Keeffe, Charles Birchfield, John Marin, Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth, and Arthur Dove, as part of a group of North American avant- garde modernist painters who transformed landscape subjects into visual abstraction.5 Sandra Shaul suggests an even stronger link between the pair, Detail of a page from Lawren S.

My research will close this gap by revealing that Harris saw O'Keeffe's work through two art patrons: Doris Louise Huestis Mills (later Speirs, 1902-1989), the Canadian painter and art writer, and Katherine Dreier, founder of the New York-based avant-garde art organization, the Société Anonyme, Inc. I will also examine Harris's personal scrapbook, a previously unstudied artifact, which includes no fewer than six reproductions of paintings by O'Keeffe. In light of this documentation, I will compare works made by O'Keeffe and Harris in the mid-twenties to argue that the relationship between these two artists merits further study. Doris Mills, Bess Housser, and The Eggplant , 1924 Although documentation establishes that Harris was familiar with O'Keeffe's painting in the mid-twenties, exactly when he became aware of her work is unknown.10 His first recorded visit to New York City, a getaway taken with some fellow officers while serving in the Canadian Army, was from 30 December 1917 to 7 January 1918.11 During this trip, it is possible that he visited the celebrated photographer, curator, and publisher Alfred Stieglitz, who had recently mounted O'Keeffe's inaugural solo exhibition at his 291 Gallery. From that show onward O'Keeffe's name appeared regularly in the media as she quickly became known for her powerful personal style, characterized by precise lines, simplified surfaces, and transcendental themes.12 By the summer of 1918 Stieglitz had made a professional commitment to show and promote O'Keeffe's work regularly.13 If her art did not catch Harris's eye while he was an army officer, it certainly would have by 1921 when O'Keeffe became one (N X X X &lt;u E 0 &gt; n &lt; u &lt; 1 &lt; u o no</page><page sequence="4">of North America's most talked-about painters. As Nancy Hopkins Reily writes, after Stieglitz (who married O'Keeffe in 1924) exhibited her paintings alongside his nude photographs of her, she was "at once on the map [and] everyone knew her name."14 In 1925, Doris Louise Huestis Mills became the first Canadian to buy a painting by O'Keeffe, a purchase that can be linked to Harris.15 Biographical entries on Mills, who exhibited with the Group of Seven in 1926, 1928, 1930, and 1931, connect her to Harris through the Toronto Studio Building where she took an atelier in the twenties and worked alongside him, A.Y. Jackson, and J.E.H. MacDonald.16 In the context of documenting Harris's interest in O'Keeffe, however, there is a much more significant connection between him and Mills and it predates the early twenties.17 In 1934, Bess Larkin Housser (1890-1969) married Harris, becoming his second wife. A painter and art journalist known for her charm and intellect, Larkin Housser was a close friend of Doris Mills. "I looked up to her as to a goddess," wrote Mills. "She was so beautiful and everything she did seemed so right to me."18 Larkin Housser was equally admiring of Mills, whom she credited as "the instigator" for encouraging her to start painting.19 The two women met as girls and had much in common: both were graduates of Toronto's Havergal Ladies College, Christian Scientists, largely self-trained artists, and dedicated supporters of the Group of Seven. Doris and her first husband W. Gordon Mills, an executive with the T. Eaton Company (and later Deputy Minister of National Defence for Naval Services in the Second World War) were among the earliest individuals to collect works of the Group of Seven, while Bess Larkin was married to F.B. Housser (1889-1936), author of the first history of the Group of Seven.20 The friendship between Bess and Fred Housser and Doris and Gordon Mills extended to Harris and his first wife Beatrice. Both Harris and Gordon Mills were members of the Arts and Letters Club, while Harris and Fred Housser had attended St. Andrews College together.21 In early 1920, Harris painted Portrait of Bess.22 He displayed his painting of Larkin Housser in the Group of Seven's first exhibition (1920) then never again showed it in public.23 There is little question that, by the time Doris Mills and Bess Housser visited New York City together in May 1925, the women shared a powerful bond with one another and with Harris.24 Well-read and cosmopolitan, Mills regularly turned to him for advice on art. In fact, in 1927, she confessed in her diary how Harris and Bess had become such important influences on her art that she needed to pay less attention to them and trust her own judgment more.25 In light of this, it is hard to imagine that Harris did not have a hand in shaping the itinerary of the two friends, which included a visit to the Anderson Galleries, where earlier that spring Steiglitz had curated an &gt; 3 IQ fü_ t O "O O) O 3 y&gt; &gt; 3 m X 3; cr ft 6 3 Û&gt; 3 Q.

Today, it is the sole O'Keeffe work owned by the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 1925, however, The Egg Plant hung in the home of Doris and Gordon Mills, where regular guests, including Lawren Harris, had ample opportunity to view it. Harris, Katherine Dreier, and The International Exhibition of Modern Art , 1926 In November 1926, Harris's path intersected with O'Keeffe's again, when both artists displayed their work in The International Exhibition of Modern Art at the Brooklyn Museum. The show was arranged by Katherine Dreier, who contacted Harris after admiring his paintings - Ontario Hill Town , 1926, and the gold-medal winning Northern Lake , ca. 1926 - at the 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition, a world's fair held from May until November in Philadelphia to celebrate the anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence.29 Dreier and Harris had an immediate rapport: both were passionate champions of contemporary art, committed theosophists, and admirers of the Russian painter and theorist Wassily Kandinsky (who was named Honorary Vice-President of the Société Anonyme in 1923).30 Dreier had founded the Société Anonyme in 1920, with Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp. The society's mandate was to promote modern art in the wake of the First World War; according to Drier, disillusionment toward the avant-garde followed the cataclysmic events of the early twentieth century. Without exposure to contemporary art, she argued, Americans would quickly lose interest in the forms that were "giving expression to the new ideas which were stirring the century."31 After seeing work by Harris in Philadelphia, Dreier invited him to join her organization and to participate in the Brooklyn show at which he was the sole Canadian representative.32 Approximately three hundred works were on view at the Société Anonyme exhibition, the largest and most significant showing of international modern art since the 1913 Armory Show.33 Harris displayed two paintings: Miners' Houses, Glace Bay , ca. 1925 and Mountain Forms (date unknown).34 He was one of 106 artists from 23 countries - among them Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Fernand Léger, Marcel Duchamp, Franz Marc, El Lissitzky, and Georgia O'Keeffe, whose paintings Grey Tree, Lake George (Fig. 2) and Abstraction II (Fig. 3) were both on show.35 On the evening of November 19, 1926, O'Keeffe and Steiglitz attended the opening of the exhibition.36 Although there is no documented account of &gt; ID 2. i1 o "O 0) rf O 3 en &gt; 3 m X 3- o; õ' p m 3 Q. û) (/) O T 0) -O O" o o 7T II3</page><page sequence="7">2 I Georgia O'Keeffe, Grey Tree , Lake George, 1925, oil on canvas, 91.4 X 76.2 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

Original work in colour) Harris's presence at the Brooklyn Museum that night, it is hard to imagine that he did not encounter O'Keeffe and her work at the show. Harris made visits to New York in the late fall of 1926 to meet with Dreier in an effort to bring the Société Anonyme exhibition to the Art Gallery of Toronto.37 For him it was "the most representative, most stimulating and the best exhibition of modern art so far shown on this continent," and its presentation in Canada was a matter of national interest.38 As he wrote to Dreier, Canadian artists would not be able to forge a nationalistic response to contemporary art until they had first-hand experience of it.39 Thanks to Harris's efforts, the Art Gallery of Toronto's board committed to showing the exhibition from 2-24 April 1927, the first display of avant-garde art in Canada.40 Despite Harris's extensive involvement in The International Exhibition of Modern Art , there is no record of his intersection with O'Keeffe's painting at the 1926 show. One potential explanation for this lack of documentation is that, despite her participation in the Brooklyn exhibition, O'Keeffe never CN X X X Q) E D 0 &gt; 1 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 &lt; u 114</page><page sequence="8">3 I Georgia O'Keeffe, Abstraction II (Pink Tulip), 1926, oil on canvas, 91.5 x 76.2 cm, The Baltimore Museum of Art: Bequest of Mabel Garrison Siemonn, in Memory of her husband George Siemonn, bma 1964. il. 13. (Photo: The Baltimore Museum of Art © Georgia O'Keeffe Museum/so d rač, 2011) joined the Société Anonyme.41 Another possible reason is that when the exhibition did come to Toronto in early 1927, O'Keeffe's paintings were not included. Owing to Stieglitz's concern for their safety, works by O'Keeffe, Stieglitz, Dove, Hartley, and Marin were all omitted from the Canadian show.42 However, it is important to consider O'Keeffe's contribution to the Brooklyn exhibition particularly with respect to Harris's writing in defence of The International Exhibition of Modern Art. When the avant-garde show opened its doors in Canada, its unfamiliar-looking works became a source of media scorn and ridicule. "Cosmic comedies" and the "greatest freaks of art" sneered the Toronto Star , which also labeled the exhibition's artists a "weird mixture of juveniles, Aztecs, and intellectuals."43 In response to widespread criticism and other angry outbursts about the show, Harris published "Modern Art and Aesthetic Reactions: An &gt; io 2. t o -a ÛJ rh o D y &gt; 3 m x 3- D" 6' p 0) 3 Q. 0) co o -t ù) -o cr O O TT HS</page><page sequence="9">Appreciation" in the Canadian Forum. His goal was to educate readers about contemporary painting and to illuminate some of its philosophical underpinnings. Most of the works in the exhibition, Harris explained, required "a new way of seeing." One had to become familiar with a fresh visual idiom to enjoy "a new, clear and thrilling communication."44 For the sake of greater comprehensibility, Harris identified two categories of abstract painting: representational works based on "naturalistic sources" and non-objective art based on "inner seeing."45 While Harris defended both categories, he declared a bias toward the first category of avant-garde painting, which he described as "the most convincing pictures," for their ability to convey "a sense of order in a purged, pervading vitality that was positively spiritual."46 As Elizabeth Turner and Marjorie Balge-Crozier demonstrate in Georgia O'Keeffe: The Poetry of Things , O'Keeffe's art, no matter how closely it flirted with abstraction, was always rooted in the thing she was painting.47 The two works that O'Keeffe had on display at the Brooklyn exhibition exemplify this quality as well as Harris's description of abstract art based on "naturalistic sources." Grey Tree, Lake George is the final work of seven in a series of canvases, each 61 x 91.5 centimeters, in which O'Keeffe depicted white tree trunks twisting amid foliage. Featuring spindly, curving, and highly expressive branches, O'Keeffe anthropomorphizes and enlivens nature's grey and green woody limbs to present an abstract vision based in nature.48 Similarly, although the title of O'Keeffe's other work in the Brooklyn exhibition, Abstraction 11, signals that the painting does not represent a familiar object, in fact its arcs of chartreuse and ripples of yellow depict a figurative image based in nature: a cropped view of a tulip's interior.49 In addition to the fact that Harris would have seen Abstraction 11 in the Brooklyn exhibition, there is another important reason to consider this painting in relation to his art. It is one of a series of large-scale flower paintings that O'Keeffe began in 1924, a body of work for which she would become particularly renowned. We know that Harris was among those who studied and considered O'Keeffe's flower paintings because his scrapbook contains Petunia and Coleus , one of eight floral works that O'Keeffe exhibited in 1925.50 The Lawren Harris Scrapbook and Six O'Keeffe Reproductions Scrapbooks are by nature private, eccentric, and idiosyncratic. Moreover, according to the historians Katherine Ott, Susan Tucker, and Patricia P. Buckler, in form, scrapbooks more often resemble a kitchen junk drawer than a thoughtfully composed visual narrative. As they write in their introduction 01 X X X &lt;u E O &gt; n &lt; o &lt; X &lt; o 116</page><page sequence="10">to The Scrapbook in American Life , "Some scrapbooks spend their entire existence unbound." Such volumes wait the day "when the gatherer will become the compiler."51 Lawren Harris's scrapbook might be classified in this way.52 It is housed at Library and Archives Canada and has been catalogued as pertaining to the years 1922-1960. However, most of its vertical, legal sized, heavy, parcel- paper-coloured pages, which measure 36.5 x 28 cm, contain pasted ephemera that is undated and uncaptioned. Moreover, the scrapbook also seems to have been a place for storing loose keepsakes, presumably to be pasted in at a later time. Such items include invitations, postcards, art exhibition programs, and reproductions of artworks. Also clipped but loose and unglued is a range of newspaper and magazine stories from Canadian and international publications including The Christian Science Monitor , The Canadian Forum, The Washington Star , and the Santa Fe New Mexican.53 Since Library and Archives Canada stores the pages of Harris's scrapbook in an unbound form and because most of its folios are undated, it is impossible to read the volume as a continuous narrative or to give it any sort of precise chronology. Nonetheless, the album does provide valuable insight into Harris's interest in Georgia O'Keeffe. In his scrapbook, Harris pasted reproductions of works by Canadian and international artists, including Alexander Archipenko, Constantin Brancusi, Pieter Brueghel, Honoré Daumier, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, A.Y. Jackson (1882-1974), Rockwell Kent, Thoreau MacDonald (1901-1989), Aristide Maillol, John Marin, Georgia O'Keeffe, Auguste Rodin, Henri Rousseau and Tom Thomson (1877-1917). However, of all the international artists whose work Harris clipped and collected, only two individuals are represented by more than three examples: Rockwell Kent, represented by nine works, and Georgia O'Keeffe, represented by six works. The works by O'Keeffe, all executed in the early 1920s, are as follows: Lake George and Blue and Green Music (pasted upside down) (Fig. 4a), Alligator Pear (Fig. 4b), The Flagpole (II) (Fig. 4c), Petunia and Coleus (pasted upside down) (Fig. 4d), and Spring/The Flagpole (Fig. 4e).54 To understand what these works might have meant to Harris, it is helpful to take a step back and consider the scrapbook as a product of its time. By the late nineteenth century, when the deluge of printed matter - ticket stubs, advertising cards, photographs, candy wrappers, news media - reached unprecedented heights, scrapbooks provided a way to create a sense of order.55 "We all read, but not with enough purpose," wrote E.W. Gurley, an early advocate of the scrapbook. He advised that a more focused understanding of print media could be achieved through the regulation, organization, and storage of material in "the well preserved pages of a good scrapbook."56 &gt; 3 ID (D_ t O "Ö O) r+ O 3 to &gt; 3 m x 3- cr r+ 5' 3 Q) 3 Q.

Harris Fonds MG30-D208, vol. 12, Library and Archives Canada) By the time Harris was a schoolboy, educators had long been promoting scrapbooks not only as a means to encourage mental concentration, improve visual literacy and train the mind's eye, but also as a valuable tool for teaching art.57 The process of cutting and pasting - skills that emphasized order and repetition - and the collection of such cultural iconography as flags, stamps, and reproductions of noteworthy paintings turned scrapbooking into a significant exercise for anyone seeking to create a personalized art notebook.58 Harris may be counted as one of several early twentieth-century artists, most famously the German Dadaist Hannah Hoch, who used the scrapbook as an aid to creating their work.59 Although they were using a mass-cultural form, these artists pioneered an authentic genre, creating an entirely unique n &gt;&lt; X X &lt;U E 0 &gt; 1 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 &lt; o r&gt; II8</page><page sequence="12">4b I Page from Lawren S.

Ott, Tucker, and Buckler support this point and argue that, in this respect, the scrapbook is similar to the artist's book, and might be understood as such.60 Furthermore, they suggest that although these volumes represent enigmatic accounts of the self, their collected pages contribute to a larger narrative of their makers. Despite the coded nature of the scrapbook, as Martha Langford states in Suspended Conversations , "the album gives voice to the intensity of human experience."61 While her words reference books of collected photographs, this insight can be applied to the Harris scrapbook. Its contents are items that were separated and preserved from the detritus of Harris's everyday life - ephemera that was valued, which provides a clue to a moment of particular intensity in his life: the mid-twenties. &gt; 3 VQ 2. t o "O Q) rt o 3 y» &gt; 3 m X 3; &amp; r+ Ó 3 Q) 3 Q.

By the thirties, the scrapbook seems to have become more of a repository for clippings than a thoughtfully composed book. Moreover, while Harris provides no caption information as to where he found the O'Keeffe reproductions in the scrapbook, with the exception of Alligator Pear ; it can be established that they were published in the mid- twenties.62 These facts reveal that just before and after 1925 was a particularly intense and noteworthy time in Harris's life with respect to his observation of O'Keeffe's work. 01 5&lt; X X CU E 0 &gt; 1 &lt; u &lt; I &lt; o •D 120</page><page sequence="14">4d I Page from Lawren S.

The Lake George reproduction came from the 15 October 1923 issue of Vogue magazine where it was part of an article called "Why Modern Art?"64 Harris clipped The Flagpole (11) from the May 1925 issue of the American art and culture journal The Dial , where it was captioned "The Flagpole Second Painting."

Harris's scrapbook reveals that during this same period he not only observed the media's attention to O'Keeffe's painting, he was moved to clip, save, and store samples of it, singling out her art from the work of others. From these facts, the following questions may be asked: Did O'Keeffe's painting have an impact on the evolution of Harris's own work during this period? And if so, what was it? n X X X cu E 0 &gt; 1 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 &lt; u •-) 122</page><page sequence="16">Harris Reconsidered In the fall of 1921, Harris left Toronto to visit the north shore of Lake Superior. Within months of this journey he began creating work that set him apart from his colleagues in the Group of Seven. The full extent of Harris's artistic evolution is exemplified in Above Lake Superior, 1921-22.69 Compared to Beaver Swamp , Algoma, 1920, painted less than two years earlier, the forms of Above Lake Superior are pared back, its colours are muted, and its brushwork is far less visible. As Jeremy Adamson writes, the painting is the artist's most pivotal work and one that "no earlier picture prepares us for."70 In the first commentary on Above Lake Superior , written in 1926 by F.B. Housser, Harris's stylistic leap is connected to his contemporaneous embrace of theosophy, a doctrine that holds all religions as spiritual attempts to evolve to greater perfection.71 While it is indisputable that theosophy had an impact on Harris's painting, in particular his reduction of forms, Housser and subsequent scholars have overemphasized its importance as the key explanation for the artist's stylistic transformation.72 Despite the prevailing myth that the Group of Seven's style came about because its members divested themselves of foreign techniques and turned exclusively to the Canadian landscape for direction, and although Harris himself insisted that his art had no known ancestry, his interest in O'Keeffe's paintings as evidenced in his scrapbook, as well as his first-hand encounter with her art in the mid-twenties, demands that his artistic development be revisited in light of these influences.73 This evolution includes a new composite form that emerged fully in Harris's painting by 1923: oscillating, undulating bands of colour. In Harris's Above Lake Superior ; 1922, the bands can be found in cloud patterns set in the sky; in Ice House , Coldwell, Lake Superior (Fig. 5), the form is evident in the sky's striations and the water's waves. The moving stripes of colour in both of these paintings are strikingly similar to the diagonal ripples found in O'Keeffe's Blue and Green Music (Fig. 4a), a work that Harris saw in 1923 and whose reproduction he included in his scrapbook. Although by 1925 Harris's subject matter differed from O'Keeffe's (landscape was his focus, hers was primarily still life, especially fruit and flowers), closer attention must be paid to how The Eggplant may have influenced his art. Part of a series of works experimenting with Cubist faceting, The Eggplant is an example of how O'Keeffe employed a reductive formalism and a flat, even application of paint to distill a single subject to its essence.74 Harris used a similar approach in his 1925 painting Mount Temple (Fig. 6), a work that, like The Eggplant, allows one natural element to become the central focus of the canvas. Although Mount Temple is based on an actual mountain, one that Harris saw when he first visited the Rockies in 1924, he &gt; 3 IQ £. o TJ Q) i- 1- -r O 3 y&gt; &gt; 3 m X 3; CT rt Õ" 3 Û) 3 Q.

Harris's North Shore , Lake Superior (Fig. 7) is a third painting worth considering in light of the art by O'Keeffe that he had seen and contemplated by the mid-twenties. One of the most notable features of the painting is that it marks an early instance of Harris honing in on his subject, presenting it close to the painting's foreground. Whereas Harris views landscape from a distance in Mount Temple , his North Shore, Lake Superior presents nature up close and with an unprecedented intensity. In this respect the painting echoes two works by O'Keeffe, both published in May 1925, and both found in the Harris scrapbook: Spring/The Flagpole (Fig. 4e) and The Flagpole (II) (Fig. 4c).

(Photo: © ngc)</page><page sequence="21">these works by O'Keeffe, North Shore , Lake Superior includes a dramatically low horizon line - one far closer to the painting's base than can be found in any previous works by Harris. As well, North Shore, Lake Superior shares a dominant compositional element with both paintings by O'Keeffe: a tall vertical form that projects from the earth and intersects with the sky. Another parallel between North Shore, Lake Superior and O'Keeffe's art lies in how Harris presents an abstracted view of his subject. A.Y.Jackson, who was with Harris when he found the damaged tree trunk depicted in the work, wrote that it was not within sight of a lake.75 From this description we might conclude that Harris's depiction of a tree trunk, lit from the side, exaggerated in its three-dimensionality, and overlooking water, represents a personalized vision of his subject. At its core North Shore, Lake Superior is a stylized consideration of nature - much like O'Keeffe's approach to her dramatically rendered tulip in Abstraction II. A final point of comparison might be made between Harris's Lake Superior m (Fig. 8) and Grey Tree, Lake George - the other painting by O'Keeffe that Harris saw at the Brooklyn exhibition. Like O'Keeffe's two flag paintings in the Harris scrapbook, this work features a low horizon, a dominant perpendicular motif, and the presentation of its subject matter as radically near. But a new element also enters this work. As Peter Larisey writes, there is an important distinction between Lake Superior m and Harris's earlier paintings of the region: its trees are "anthropomorphic ... as they bend or lean toward the light."76 Only one year earlier Harris had encountered a similar vision of nature in O'Keeffe's Grey Tree, Lake George. Arguably, her attenuated and life-like branches offered a source of inspiration for Harris's otherworldly and reaching tree in Lake Superior in. The New Mexico Connection Starting in 1929, Harris faced numerous challenges both in his professional and personal life that would bring his painting to a near standstill by 1930. He was committed to the promotion of modern art yet he could not wholeheartedly embrace abstraction; he continued to promote Canadian culture yet his own painting increasingly presented an interest in a universal consciousness. Moreover, Harris had fallen in love with Bess Housser, for whom he would leave his wife of twenty-four years, Beatrice 77 In 1934, seeking refuge from disapproving friends and relatives in Toronto, the couple moved to Hanover, New Hampshire, where Harris's uncle and friend William Kilborne Stewart was a professor at Dartmouth College.78 Further evidence of Harris's connection to O'Keeffe during this period comes from Emily Carr (1871-1945). While the late twenties marked a time (N X X X Q) E 0 &gt; ZT &lt; U &lt; 1 &lt; O rj 128</page><page sequence="22">of artistic stagnation for Harris, the opposite was true for Carr, whom he mentored and counted as a friend from the time of their first meeting in 1927. Harris was a tireless supporter of Carr's work and arranged for her to meet Katherine Dreier in New York in April 1930. Dreier then introduced Carr to O'Keeffe, who had just returned from a four-month stay at the Taos home of the American arts patron Mabel Dodge Luhan.79 There O'Keeffe had found volcanic mountains and empty deserts that spoke to her; she learned of prehistoric Indian culture in which colour symbolism played an active role and vibrant native ritual in worship of the land and universe.80 Following this experience the artist wrote, "I feel so alive that I am apt to crack at any moment," and resolved to spend a part of every year in New Mexico.81 Carr witnessed O'Keeffe's enthusiasm for the Southwest first hand when she viewed the artist's recent Taos paintings at An American Place, the gallery Stieglitz opened in 1929 82 While Carr's correspondence with Harris has been lost, there is a considerable possibility that she told him how these works affected her. As Sharon Udall writes, after Carr met O'Keeffe her art began "to pulsate with the force of vibrations, as O'Keeffe's work."83 Even if Harris did not learn of O'Keeffe's paintings from Carr, he would have read about them. The press covered O'Keeffe's 1930 exhibition extensively, reporting that the New Mexico work marked a decided change in her painting and a fresh, spiritual, indigenous, and abstracted approach to landscape 84 Harris's art also underwent a fundamental transition in the early thirties. Within weeks of his arrival in New Hampshire, Harris began to paint again after a two-year hiatus and his compositions moved toward a new type of abstraction, one based on inner seeing. It was an evolution that would be fully realized only when he moved to New Mexico four years later and became part of the Transcendental Painting Group, composed of artists who were concerned with the development and presentation of various types of non-representational painting.85 For Harris, an artist who identified himself as a painter of Canadian landscapes, this stylistic shift was monumental. Moreover, it was one that defined the rest of his artistic career. By 1939, Lawren and Bess Harris were living happily in Santa Fe where they were members of the city's vibrant arts scene. In mid-February of that year Doris Mills received a letter from Bess, packed with accounts of her friend's new Southwestern home. The note also included details of her travels with Harris to New York City earlier that month. As part of their trip out east, Bess told Mills how they visited Steiglitz and had a "tender and lovely" time 86 The familiarity implied in this phrase suggests that by the late thirties, Harris and Bess's relationship with Steiglitz was hardly new. This gives further credence to the assertion that the Harrises ended up in Santa Fe by intention rather than coincidence.

Harris first came into contact with theosophy while studying in Berlin from 1904 to 1908, but like many others of his generation, adopted its principles after the First World War. In 1922 Harris became a member of the Toronto Theosophical Society and by the time he painted Above Lake Superior , he was a firm believer that, in accordance with theosophical doctrine, the contemplation of visible nature and the rendering of natural scenes and effects demanded a simplification of the naturalistic to its fundamental and purest forms. 72 See Adam SON, Lawren S. Harris , 123-24 and Thom, "Lawren Stewart Harris: A Canadian Painter," 29-33. 73 Harris said of his art: "It was not derivative. It was not English Landscape.

This painting is a depiction of a great pine described in D.H. Lawrence's novel set in Taos, St. Mawr. From that conversation, Carr developed a fascination with Lawrence and would soon copy the St. Mawr passage into her journal. According to Sharyn Udall, Carr's meeting with O'Keeffe may have influenced her decision (in 1930-31) to produce charcoal drawings that moved away from native imagery and toward a search for nature's formal equivalents. As well, after Carr's meeting with O'Keeffe, she began to incorporate zig-zag or saw-tooth shapes into her work (see Untitled , 1930) as O'Keeffe had done before her.

ANGEL En 1938, Lawren S. Harris (1885-1970) et son épouse, Bess Larkin Housser Harris (1890-1969), quittent Hanover, New Hampshire, où ils demeuraient depuis quatre ans, après leur départ de Toronto en 1934, pour Santa Fe, Nouveau-Mexique. Bien que les documents indiquent que ce déménagement a été le fruit du hasard, nous soutenons, dans le présent article, que le facteur déterminant qui sous-tendait le départ de Harris pour le sud-ouest américain, était l'intérêt qu'il portait à l'artiste américaine Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986) qui, à partir de 1929, passait une partie de l'année à Abiquiú, Nouveau- Mexique, près de Santa Fe. Pendant des décennies, les historiens de l'art ont tracé des parallèles entre l'œuvre de Harris et celle d'O'Keeffe. Tous deux peignaient à la même époque et s'intéressaient à des sujets comme la transformation des paysages en abstractions visuelles, le contenu symboliste transcendant et la conception d'une réponse indigène au modernisme européen. Pourtant aucune étude n'offre de preuves évidentes qui permettent de savoir quelles peintures d'O'Keeffe Harris a vues et quand. Pour combler ce vide, le présent article cherche comment Harris a pu se familiariser avec l'art d'O'Keeffe durant les années 1925 et 1926, et lesquelles de ses œuvres il a pu voir. L'article discute de la manière dont Harris a connu les peintures d'O'Keeffe grâce à deux mécènes, Doris Louise Huestis Mills (plus tard Speirs, 1902-1989), peintre canadien et écrivaine d'art, et Katherine Dreier (1877-1952), fondatrice de la célèbre organisation new-yorkaise d'art d'avant- garde, la Société Anonyme, Inc. En 1925, Mills est la première personne au Canada à acheter une œuvre d'O'Keeffe, acquisition qu'on peut associer à Harris et à sa seconde épouse, Bess. L'année suivante, le chemin de Harris croise de nouveau celui d'O'Keeffe, et les deux artistes exposent leurs œuvres à Y International Exhibition of Modem Art au Brooklyn Museum, la plus grande et la plus importante exposition internationale d'art moderne depuis YArmory Show de 1913. Bien que Harris se soit largement investi dans cette exposition internationale d'art moderne de 1926 et qu'il ait contribué à la faire venir SUJ S 3 co "LU Cd</page><page sequence="30">au Canada, le présent article est le premier à indiquer précisément quelles œuvres d'O'Keeffe il y a vues. Les rapports de l'artiste à O'Keeffe sont examinés de manière plus approfondie par une exploration de l'album personnel de Harris, qui se trouve à Bibliothèque et Archives Canada et qui n'a pas encore été étudié. Bien que les rapports de Doris Mills et de Katherine Dreier ne laissent aucun doute quant au fait que Harris a vu personnellement les œuvres d'O'Keeffe en 1925 et en 1926, l'album de Harris révèle que, durant la même période, il a non seulement pris note de l'intérêt des médias pour les peintures d'O'Keeffe, mais qu'il a été porté à en découper et conserver des exemplaires. L'album comprend pas moins de six reproductions de toiles d'O'Keeffe. Bien que l'auteur de l'album ne donne aucune information sur la provenance des reproductions, le présent article les date du milieu des années vingt, démontrant que la période autour de 1925 a été une époque particulièrement intense et remarquable dans la vie de Harris relativement à ce qu'il a pu observer du travail d'O'Keeffe. A la lumière de cette nouvelle documentation, on peut comparer les toiles de Harris et d'O'Keeffe pour soutenir que les rapports entre ces deux artistes méritent une étude plus poussée. Une attention particulière se porte sur le changement de style de Harris à l'automne 1921, comme le montre Above Lake Superior , 1921-1922, où il commence à créer une œuvre qui le démarque de ses collègues du Groupe des Sept. A partir du premier article sur cette œuvre, par F.B. Housser en 1926, le saut stylistique de Harris a été relié à son adhésion à la théosophie à la même époque. Nous soutenons que, bien que les nouvelles croyances spirituelles de l'artiste aient eu un impact indéniable sur sa peinture, les historiens de l'art ont surestimé son importance comme clé de la transformation stylistique de l'artiste. Malgré le mythe prévalent voulant que le style du Groupe des Sept soit venu du fait que ses membres ont abandonné les techniques étrangères pour se tourner exclusivement vers le paysage canadien, et bien que Harris lui-même ait insisté sur le fait que son art n'avait pas d'ancêtre connu, sa connaissance des toiles d'O'Keeffe, que démontre son album, ainsi que sa rencontre de première main avec les œuvres de l'artiste américaine, au milieu des années vingt, exige que son développement artistique soit revisité à la lumière de ces influences.
