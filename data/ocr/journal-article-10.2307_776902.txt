<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Questions Concerning Classicism in Relation to Chinese Art By John Hay In Chinese art history, the validity of "classical" as a concept for descrip- tive and analytic purposes presents problems at several levels. What exam- ples can we take as being classical, or even analogous to the classical? Imme- diately one is cast back on the complex function of classicism as a structural and a prescriptive norm in relation to artists, to society and to history. If by "classicism" is meant the art of antiq- uity taken as a norm, are its later rendi- tions "classicizing" by purpose or by style? And if it is a norm, then what was normative? A strong case is made by Martin Powers, in this issue of Art Journal, regarding as classical in both purpose and style the use to which art was put by Chinese official clans of the later Han (A.D. 25-220). (Perhaps we should say "proto-classical," if we expect a classi- cal model to survive prescriptively as a model.) Although some of the aesthetic ideals favored by the later Han officials may have survived and may have been reasserted, as perhaps in the late eighth century, it is hard to demonstrate an enduring style, even in the sense of a coherent set of visual qualities, still less as embodied in actual works of art. Nevertheless, by the fourth century A.D. we find both actual work and embodied style in a form that survived as a prescriptive model for about 1,500 years. Although the figural style of this century can be traced back to the later Han, the social context and purpose of fourth-century art is fundamentally dif- ferent. Ku K'ai-chih (c.344-c.406) was an exemplary figure painter of the East- ern Chin dynasty (317-419), a crucial period when a nexus of aesthetic values was purposefully and coherently devel- Fig. 1.

Painters and calligraphers such as Ku K'ai-chih and his colleagues were either close to or actually at the aristocratic center of political power. Here, there is little or no sense of either austerity or antiquity, yet we find a highly durable model that could, when required, serve such ends and also others. The self- containing but expanding envelopes of Ku K'ai-chih's drapery patterns (Fig. 1) are still readily identifiable in the T'ang dynasty portraits of emperors of antiq- uity painted by Yen Li-pen (d. 674) to confirm contemporary imperial power in accordance with long-established models (Fig. 2). That the style is still serving an equivalent purpose in the twelfth century is demonstrated by a handscroll by Wang Li-yung (active 1120-after 1145), a parade of portraits of the Transformations of Master Lao, as an imperialist review of the legiti- macy of the Taoist religion (Fig. 3). And it is still alive in the seventeenth century, in, for example, portraits of the Eastern Chin poet T'ao Yuan-ming (Fig. 4) painted by Ch'en Hung-shou (1598-1652).l In 1970, Richard Barn- hart addressed some of these issues in a paper significantly called "Survivals, Revivals, and the Classical Tradition of Chinese Figure Painting." 2 The painting of both Yen Li-pen and Wang Li-yung is imperial in context of production, in subject matter, and in 26Art Journal</page><page sequence="2">style. In this regard, Frank Kermode's strong association of classicism in litera- ture with the notion of Empire is fun- damentally suggestive.3 The need for legitimacy in succession, and the effec- tiveness of coherence and clarity in its symbolic representation, are analogous to the problems of an ideally invariant text in the face of constantly changing interpretations. One might say that the art of later Han officials provided the first classical perception; that Ku K'ai-chih's art is the source of what eventually proved to be a classical style, that Yen Li-pen's is the fulfillment of that style; and Wang Li- yung's is classicizing. Some terms such as "archaizing," or perhaps the "pedan- tic classical," might be adopted for an art, such as Ch'en Hung-shou's, that turns inwards instead of outwards and serves no institutional purpose. This would leave us with the question of whether Ch'en's work is a confirmation or a denial of the classical, or some more complex relationship. In this connection, it may be suggested that an attempt to delineate the "classical" in China- besides examining what kinds of work might be so described, and besides ask- ing what kind of norm was exemplified by such works-might look for the spe- cific function involved. In China, this might well be that of the legitimate lineage, a concept of enormous cultural importance.4 Classical art, in any sense that can be used transculturally, is art with a certain status. It acquires this label only through being systematically used in an appropriate way. Such art is not only a style but a way of dealing explicitly with a style and promoting it for particular ends. In this sense, the looser term "clas- sic" remains significantly close to "clas- sical," as a competitor on its own terms, whether trivial or substantial. But what is more strictly "classical" not only is more enduring but also substantiates particular and paradigmatic morpho- logical values. It is the durability and authoritative value of the paradigm itself that bestows status. It must be exemplified with clarity, even if what is embodied is not so clear. For the work of art, there is an objective function that must operate at more than one level. The style, in order to exemplify symbolic power, must make its own object clear; but the style itself is also objectified. Further, it must embody this quality self-reflexively, and it must be seen to deal with itself objectively. In the case of a work such as Ch'en Hung-shou's representation of T'ao Yuan-ming, one could, however, ask if the painting is in itself seen as anticlassi- Fig. 2. Yen Li-pen (d. 674), Thirteen Emperors (section 11), handscroll, ink and colors on silk. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. cal, without resort to the artist's psy- chology. Perhaps the answer lies in a deliberate reversal and confusion, through visual form, of objectivity and subjectivity, rather than the clear trans- lation of the latter into the former. The question is related to James Cahill's discussion of this style in terms of irony.5 But there are more much general questions to be asked. Ch'en Hung- shou's age, the seventeenth century, had an interest in antiquity that was intense, even by Chinese standards. Ch'en's "ar- chaism" is readily labeled as ku-i, a concept of great importance to him and his time but established long before, at least as early as the T'ang dynasty (A.D. 618-906). Ku-i is usually translated by terms such as "archaic idea," or "idea of the ancient." Given that the Chinese tradition was obsessed with exemplars provided by antiquity, the concept of ku-i may seem a ready candidate for "classicism." The fact that in China much of painting and all of cal- ligraphy-the only "arts" in an elitist definition-were so extensively tied to the cult of literacy also tempts one to define the Chinese "classical" in essen- tially literate terms. But this would immediately lead beyond the limitations of "imperial," and even tend to exclude them. In doing so, we would lose touch, not only with what still seems to be a critical factor but, more generally, with imagery itself. So let us turn away from the humanistic classical for the moment. A major problem in comparing Western and Chinese notions of classicism-and the transcultural use of the term "classical" is unavoidably com- parative-arises from a basic shift in Chinese pictorial art of the tenth cen- tury. Primary status moved from figural subject matter to landscape, and remained there. Although imperial courts of the eleventh and twelfth centu- Spring 1988 27</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3.

One could say that, in these cases, power is the prime interest. One of the most ancient and basic terms for "political power" is shih, which, in its earliest usage in pre-Han texts, means the dynamic potential invested in a particu- lar configuration, such as a boulder bal- anced on a cliff, a compact and resilient military formation, or a king in his pal- ace. It later becomes an important con- cept in art theory. When mountains and rivers were seen as conformations result- ing specifically from patterns of energy within the earth-as they were by the Han dynasty and so remained-then landscape eventually and inevitably came to be the greatest icon of power in the earthly world, just as the emperor was so in the political and social struc- ture.6 Even though the iconological account would have to be rather devious, owing to the nature of textual evidence in Chinese art, I believe that these func- tions are quite clear in such paintings as the Metropolitan Museum's Summer Mountains, which has been attributed to Ch'ii Ting, a painter at the early- eleventh-century imperial court (Fig. 5). This is the kind of Chinese landscape often loosely called "classic." The term "classical," as a historicizing aspect of the imperium, should, however, proba- bly be applied to two other categories. The first is the landscape painting asso- ciated with the court of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) during the fif- teenth century. Its stylistic references were clear and, though varied, were as much to the art associated with the court of the thirteenth century (Fig. 6), as to that of the eleventh. Chinese critics have traditionally considered the land- scapes of the eleventh and thirteenth centuries as fundamentally opposed. But they were compatible within the fifteenth-century court and among art- ists whose work matched the imperial taste, the products of which are charac- terized by clarity, objectivity, energy, and extroversion. Chung Li, called to the court in the third decade of the fifteenth century, is a good example (Fig. 7). The second category is the landscape associated with the court of the eigh- teenth century. It shares some qualities of the Ming landscapes but complicates the stylistic sources. Its affiliations were often to the art of scholar painters, on the other side of a critical divide. This is seen, for instance, in Landscape in Snow (Fig. 8), by T'ang Tai (1673-after 1751), referring back indirectly to the eleventh-century artist Kuo Hsi (Fig. 9) 28 Art Journal</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 5.

New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art. through a complex screen of artists whose brushwork was more acceptable to the scholar tradition than Kuo's. It is possible to label the arts of both the fifteenth- and the eighteenth-century imperium "classical." In T'ang Tai's case, we might say that we have a classi- cal landscape raised to unassailable orthodoxy by being rendered in an even more classical technique. The difference between them, and also the consider- able range of styles that both courts did in fact embrace, have important implications. In modern scholarship and in teach- ing, the terms "classical" and "clas- sicizing" are quite often used in relation to Chinese art: sometimes loosely, as in regard to certain categories of art that achieved an unsurpassed or normative status, such as landscape painting of the eleventh century; sometimes more tight- ly, as in Martin Powers's analysis of Han dynasty art. Such usage, as we are all aware, calls into question basic art- historical issues. E.H. Gombrich has sagely distinguished anticlassical art (such as Impressionism), from "the unclassical for which, perhaps, Chinese art may offer a good example, in so far as the Chinese artists never rejected principles of which they could have no cognizance."7 His point is neatly made, but it is not the final one. Terms such as "classicism," although deeply entwined in their culturally specific and usually very complex growth, often perform yeoman service in foreign fields. Their support has been essential and produc- tive in many a description. Analysis can become impossibly convoluted if we carry examination of our terms to a perverse extreme in a desperate deter- mination to create new and untainted terminology. Nevertheless, questions must be asked, and by asking them in a field such as Chinese art, where our own problems of definition are still at a more elementary stage, perhaps we may serve our colleagues in areas where they are more subtle. In his essay "Norm and Form," Gom- brich begins by viewing the classical as a negative, or exclusive category, prohib- iting certain other stylistic qualities that are usually viewed as undesirable. Then Spring 1988 29</page><page sequence="5">he describes how the development of morphological theory in the nineteenth century provided a basis, even if an illusory one, for promoting formerly excluded styles as equivalent morpho- logical development. Next, arguing with Wolfflin's polarities, he emphasizes his- torical specifics rather than universaliz- ing "essentialism." Finally, he regener- alizes the classical as the tendency towards order, in a dialectic with real- ism. I agree with much of what Gom- brich says and, indeed, I am turning to him for that very reason. But he does not go on to discuss how his final universal- izing proposal reflects back on his ini- tial, historical limitation. He refers to "primitive art," for example, as "an art of rigid symmetries sacrificing plausibil- ity to a wonderful sense of pattern,"8 and, by implication, removes such "or- der" from the problem of "classicism," because the primitive artist's choices are made within an entirely inappropriate set of possibilities and historical se- quence thereof. But he implicitly acknowledges both the problem and a possible conflict within his own account by also remarking that "The rejection of richness and intricacy for the sake of Fig. 8. T'ang Tai (1673-after 1751), Landscape in Snow, hanging scroll, ink and color on paper. Princeton University, The Art Musuem, anonymous loan. clarity and simplicity [in the classic ideals of the Italian Renaissance] proba- bly presupposes a degree of aesthetic sophistication that can only be found here [in the Renaissance] and, possibly, in Far Eastern art." 9 I am not sure about the fundamental relationship between order and realism in Gombrich's scheme. It sometimes sounds as though exemplification of order is the basic matter of art, while visual realism is its final cause. What- ever may be the case, an initial applica- tion to Chinese material seems encour- aging. The Sung dynasty (960-1279) was an era of extraordinary achieve- ment in painting. But, as mentioned, there are few contrasts more startling than the monumental landscape struc- tures of the eleventh century (see Figs. 5 and 9) and the focused precision of the early thirteenth (see Fig. 6). The former must certainly be included among the most effective embodiments of order in Chinese art; but the latter are the most visually representational. The earlier landscapes, both as ideal and in specific instances, continued to exert a powerful influence over centuries of later paint- ers. But in the critical tradition, as contrasted with the halls of emperor, official, and merchant, those of the thir- teenth century were increasingly derided. The earlier landscape styles were absorbed into the painting of four- teenth-century scholar painters and were thereby explicity embodied in an entire subsequent tradition. This tradi- tion seems, with respect to its social, educational, and professional practices, closely comparable to that of the classi- cally oriented elite in Europe. Similarly, the critical rejection of thirteenth- century realism often sounds quite simi- lar to the classicist Giovanni Bellori's alliance with the critics of his time, who criticized Caravaggio "for being too natural in painting likenesses, [as] Lysippus reproached the vulgarity of the Sculptors who made men as they are found in nature"; and then explained that "the common people refer every- thing they see to the visual sense. They praise things painted naturally, being used to such things; appreciate beautiful colors, not beautiful forms, which they do not understand, ... and walk away from the truth in art." 0 One could build up a significant mass of descriptive and normative analogies. But we are here back to the marked division between what might be called "classical" in the imperial sense and what is often so called in a humanistic sense. The comparison and the problem are complex. In China the landscape of order is Fig. 9. Kuo Hsi, Early Spring, dated 1072, hanging scroll, ink and light colors on silk. Taipei, National Palace Museum. rich and intricate, whereas the land- scape of visual realism has simplicity and clarity. Further, the disdain for realism in the Chinese tradition, was both more consistent than and differ- ently formed from that of the West. Indeed the entire critical tradition- inseparable from its sociological base- seems to have devoted itself from the eleventh century onwards to articulating the rejection of realism. Speaking very broadly, if something comparable to the Gombrichian dialectic existed, it was between "classical order" and a concept of humanistic expressionism. Insofar as the humanistic tradition was itself the repository of "classical" values, the dynamics must obviously have differed greatly from those in the West. But the problem is still more complex. Gom- brich makes his point by turning Wolfflin's polarity of "painterly" and "linear" back to those terms they were supposed to replace-"fidelity to na- ture" and "composition." He then remarks: "Clearly, the more a painting or a statue mirrors natural appearances, the fewer principles of order and sym- metry will it automatically exhibit. Con- versely, the more ordered a configura- tion, the less will it be likely to reproduce 30 Art Journal</page><page sequence="6">nature." " The unspoken assumptions here are all-embracing. They are the definitions of nature, order, and fidelity. Gombrich himself continues by noting an issue that I find of very great interest, that the "striking achievements of clas- sic Renaissance art were scarcely dis- cussed by the writers and critics of the Cinquecento." To a great extent, the striking achievements of Gombrich's art history are made within a similarly silent horizon. T he dialectic of order and nature is quintessentially Western and lies at the root of many of our greatest achieve- ments. Were Erwin Panofsky still alive, he might tack a chapter on Gombrich's dialectical system onto his classic (i.e., exemplary) monograph, Idea: A Con- cept in Art History (originally published in 1924), which traces the shifting cen- ter of theoretical gravity, embodied in the term "Idea," as representation sought its place between ordering princi- ple and objective world. The term "idea" itself may be attached to quite opposing concepts, but the explanation of classicism must, in part, be sought in this development. The significance of "idea" is rooted in Greek thought, especially the ideas of Plato and their interaction over millen- nia with those of Aristotle. One of the primary affiliations of Neoplatonism throughout its evolution (still continuing today) has been to the parallel evolution of abstraction. There has been been an effort, passing through endlessly subtle considerations, both to distinguish and to relate the concreteness and specificity of experience and expression and the abstract entities that give the world sta- bility and meaning; in short, to reduce nature to order. Whether such order be lodged in heaven or in man, the mimetic function of art can achieve a satisfactory solution only within a transient context. This mimetic circumstance seems to be shared by the models of both art and science. Plato was clear that the human mind must approach the absolute through geometry, the means by which "the appearances were saved" and the errors of transient sensory experi- ence coordinated with permanent, unchanging truth.12 I follow an opinion that takes geome- try to be the most fundamental and enduring paradigm in Western cosmo- logical thought.' Classicism was born in a Platonic world of geometry and abso- lutes, a world shared equally by science and art. Even though both art theory and an epistemology such as John Locke's could assimilate the external absolute to the internal mind, the funda- mental pattern of relationships could not change. The stability of the geometrical object in this world remained a critical value. The nature of both classical and classicist art is necessarily linked to these issues at two levels. First, its role as a norm is dependent on the nature of an abstract entity-an absolute or uni- versal. Second, the qualities maintained in this norm were those most congenial to the systematic stability of a geomet- rical world. China's cosmology was not funda- mentally geometrical. Both the system- atic nature of a model and the values that such a model might most signifi- cantly embody were quite different. Such well-qualified people as Joseph Needham have addressed at length the primarily algebraic and nongeometrical nature of China's mathematical genius and her entire cosmology.'4 I won't go over the ground again, save to empha- size that the difference is most vividly seen in the function of space: a geomet- rical space conceived by points, lines, planes, and angles is fundamentally dif- ferent from a space-which may per- haps be considered algebraic-in which nuclear relationships spread out through expanding equations, capable of gener- ating systems of endless complexity in which the compressed potentiality at the core can still be identified at its outer- most limits. Geometrical space, we might say, is projected; what I am call- ing algebraic space is propagated. Dis- tinctions of object and subject, the dual- ity of mass and void, the systematic objectification of optical perspective, and the directional illumination of light from a single source all have to fight for existence within algebraic space, whereas geometrical space, optically delineated, entails a quite definite kind of hierarchy. What we know as classical style is inseparable from a geometrically hierarchial view. If there was a classical style in Chinese space, then it must have implied a correspondingly different hierarchy. I am talking not about exclu- sive rights to certain concepts but about fundamental orientations adopted at crucial stages inside coherent cultural evolutions. It is not so much that collec- tive thought restricts the originality of individual thinkers as that the collective norm establishes both their relevance and their usefulness. And classicism is a collective norm. Could entropic space ever be at the very core of a classical image in the West, as it so characteristi- cally is in the "classic" landscape by Kuo Hsi, Early Spring (see Fig. 9)? 15 The boundary between a concept, as cultural organism, and its historical environment is always elastic. Within one fundamental orientation, efforts at comprehending complementary percep- tions are always pulled back by the tensions of a larger environment. There are many examples of such tensions between opposing organizational sche- mata in Chinese landscape painting. An outstanding one is Traveling among Streams and Mountains, by Fan K'uan (Fig. 10). Whereas Kuo Hsi's Early Spring is an archetype of the order of changefulness, Fan's landscape seems to exemplify the opposite. It is almost rigidly axial, with an astonishing sym- metry, stability, and clarity. But it is unique in its single-minded commitment to these qualities. I should, in passing, note that Fan K'uan was thoroughly individualistic, unconnected with the court. Even so, when we search for the source of this painting's overpowering strength, we find it in a suppressed but enormously powerful ambience of the kind that explodes in Kuo Hsi. The top of Fan's mountain reveals the same ser- pentine structure. The space between the middle-ground hill and the seem- ingly monolithic mountain cannot be measured; it is a highly compressed res- ervoir of entropic space, so full of energy that it lifts the mountain towards the heavens. Kuo Hsi's changeful moun- tains are articulated by discontinuities that are almost invisible beneath the fluxing surface, such discontinuities' being inherent in changefulness itself. Fan K'uan's massively independent monoliths are activated by an inescap- able atmosphere and undercurrent of continuities.'6 What I find so astonish- ing about this painting is precisely its contradictory denial of avoirdupois and geometrical stability, as though the gigantic mountain is a disguised hot-air balloon. Such a contradiction would probably have to operate in the opposite direction within the Western classical tradition. There is a much quoted passage from Gottlob Frege that almost perfectly complements a characteristic statement by Chu Hsi (1130-1200), the greatest master of the Neo-Confucianist synthe- sis. Frege wrote: "If everything were in continual flux, and nothing maintained itself fixed for all time, there would no longer be any possibility of getting to know anything about the world and everything would be plunged into confu- sion." 17 Chu Hsi wrote: "The constant and lasting Way of the universe refers to creation and transformation ... to last long is not to be fixed. Someone asked, "If a thing has already changed, how can it be called longlasting?' Chu Hsi answered, 'to go in and out is to be permanent.' " The contrast between these two views is, I believe, general and fundamental. Spring 1988 31</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 10. Fan K'uan (active c.960-c.1030), Traveling among Streams and Mountains, hanging scroll, ink and colors on silk. Taiwan, National Palace Museum. The urgency of maintaining fixed iden- tities and stable patterns, the ideas of the eternal truth in a world relentlessly pressing its illusion of change, was an integral support to the classical ideal, whereas the exemplification of how changefulness envelops the transitory illusion of fixedness was sought with equal urgency in the Chinese tradition. Chad Hansen has written: "There is no role in Chinese philosophical theories like that played by terms such as mean- ing, concept, notion, or idea in Western philosophy";19 and again, "there is indeed no Platonic Realism in Ancient China (also no theory of abstract sets or classes)."20 Hansen demonstrates that this question has nothing to do with sophistication of philosophical specula- tion. Indeed, he suggests that there is a convergence between ancient Chinese thinking and contemporary linguistic philosophy that makes his analysis pos- sible. It is hardly coincidental that histo- rians of scientific thought, Joseph Need- ham, for example, have pointed to a similar relationship between the episte- mologies of ancient China and modern science. I referred earlier to the term ku-i, "idea of the ancients." Does this not signify the existence of both ideas and abstract entities? It is, however, a typi- cal problem of translation, and how to translate the element "i" is no easy matter. In discussing its use in linguistic analysis of the Mohists, of the fourth to third centuries B.C., Chad Hansen fol- lows a recent tendency to render it as "intentionality." Although the develop- ment of Chinese Buddhist philosophy, especially from the third to the eighth centuries A.D., entailed very sophisti- cated speculation on the nature of Mind, often involving powerful tensions with indigenous ontology-in numerous in- stances thus presenting profound prob- lems of translation-I believe that in the texts of art "intentionality" remains the most valid general rendering. With some of its Western philosophical sense, but primarily indicating the particular direction characterizing a particular pattern-whether of thought, action, or simply of becoming, in a world in which all existence is becoming-it need have nothing whatsoever of the abstract sense of "Idea." It is closer to Aristotle's fourth and final "because," the destina- tion in which structure and behavior were finally realized. Since the Chinese world was not Aristotelian, however, and its entire structure of causality was different, i is not the Aristotelian "final cause." The eleventh-century land- scapist Kuo Hise left extensive com- ments on landscape painting, and a criti- cal role is played in these comments by i. When, in 1072, Kuo Hsi painted Early Spring, he succeeded in exemplifying the "intentionality" of landscape. We know what it means for this landscape to be; we are informed about the nature of the subject matter in a way that classical art in the West does not normally do. But we are tempted, almost without thinking, to call this painting "a classic landscape." The subsequent tendency is for this term to become more specifically attached to the work of a particular painter, so that a later artist might, for example, inscribe his own work as "fol- lowing the intentionality of the brush of Kuo Hsi." Our natural tendency to iden- tify the abstract notion of a style in such cases is almost always frustrated, even when we can sense that a relationship exists. A further indication of this cir- cumstance comes from the values of the court academy of Emperor Hui-tsung, who reigned from 1101 to 1125. As embodied in paintings that are versions of eighth- and ninth-century works probably in the imperial collection, the criteria of this academy focused on a three-way tension between maintaining a close relationship with earlier painting 32 Art Journal</page><page sequence="8">of particular type (form-likeness) and achieving hua-i (the "intentionality of a painting"). Hui-tsung's court would be a very useful context in which to focus questions of classicism. Here, I can only note that the hua-i is really an ontologi- cal concept indicating what it means to be a painting, and is not an abstract, Neoplatonic Ideal. At the end of the eleventh century, the poet and cal- ligrapher Su Shih was adding his own comments to the development of an idea fundamental to the act of writing: "When the force of my brush has to wind and turn in pursuit of where my intention (i) has already reached, ... this is the most wonderful experience I have had." 21 e seem to be getting further away YV Y from classicism. But that is the point. In the Chinese situation, the more we inquire into the factors fundamental in Western classicism, the further we seem to get away from it. And it cer- tainly has nothing to do with sophistica- tion. The classical ideal in the West- we cannot escape the fact-was what it was because it so convincingly located the horizons of the Western world, hugely though they may expand and dramatically though they may shift. But there was an analogously paradigmatic role for art in China. Kuo Hsi's Early Spring, besides conveying the intention- ality of its early spring landscape, necessarily exemplifies also the cosmo- logically fundamental quality of changefulness through which all exis- tence validated and sustained itself. It is clear, at least on this level, why the subject of mountain-water became the "classical" icon in Chinese painting. The Chinese saw cosmological order exemplified in nature, not as mediated from absolutes by geometry. Landscape was not anthropomorphic, but humans were cosmomorphic.22 Chad Hansen's analysis is helpful here. In the Chinese language, in gener- al, the units of vocabulary can be distin- guished as nouns, verbs, or adjectives only when significant strings are ana- lyzed in the language of Western gram- mar. There are no universals and par- ticulars, no abstract properties and concrete instances, and Chinese philoso- phers of language had little concern for meaning and definition according to Western criteria. The language is nomi- nalist, and, in Hansen's terms, words refer concretely to "stuffs." His explan- atory model is taken from the normal usage of mass nouns in English. In such cases, "wood," for example, we would distinguish a particular from a universal by saying "I need a piece of wood" as opposed to "I like wood"; but most of our nouns take the article directly. Wood comes from a tree. All Chinese nouns are mass nouns. Numbers and articles are always separated from the name by a measure, "one stick of tree." In a comparative analysis, Hansen writes: "For every abstract set of objects [in the Western mode] one can con- struct a concrete mereological object by regarding all the different members of the set [i.e., each instance of referring to it] as one discontinuous stuff. Identify- ing different members of the set is the same as identifying spatio-temporally different parts of the same stuff."23 The relationship of member to mass-stuff seems comparable to participation, as basic to scholastic thought and as ana- lyzed by Owen Barfield in Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry (1965). The idea of participation is important here, but the presence of god was essential to the scholastic function of participation. In the Chinese system, however, there is no deity, just as there is no absolute. The participation not only was more important but also functioned within a radically different ecology. The primacy of participation radically af- fects the status of mimesis. Causality and therefore time are similarly af- fected. Hansen is analyzing linguistic philosophy of the fourth and third cen- turies B.C. But the most interesting work in the whole of Chinese art theory, by one of the greatest painters of the seven- teenth century, Tao-chi, can certainly be read as an explicit articulation of the "mass-noun" ontology.24 Thus, on the basis of language, one cannot propose a "classical" style in China as a set of abstract properties to be instantiated in a specific work of art. But one can suggest, on the same basis, why landscape-"mountain-water"- became the equivalent of a classical paradigm. More than any other subject matter, mountain-water provided a paradigmatic mass-stuff, and each mountain-water painting was a member of this stuff. A mountain-water painting participates mountain-water, and both painter and audience also participate transitively. The relationships necessary to Western classicism could survive in this world only with great difficulty. The Chinese "classical" work, in the sense of one exemplifying the basic cultural paradigm, is one that best promotes participation through both space and time. The frequency of such works in later Chinese painting, and the rele- vance of the priority of calligraphy, need no comment. here does this leave our various issues? The aspect of classicism, its imperial aspect, that primarily refers to its institutional function is identifi- able in China, and certain formal quali- ties, which promote clarity in public exemplification, are also associated with it. These qualities are not simply those of public impact, for their purpose is not to incite but to insure, to subject through objectifying. Further, it was probably in the Confucian structure of society that China found its most secure paradigm of stability. Hence, one tends to find har- mony in the sense of a balanced hierar- chy in art that is symbolic of such soci- ety. One must, however, be extremely chary about being too prescriptive here. It is probably safer to stress the link between legitimacy and stylistic lineages. The aspect of stylistic reference is obviously basic to classicism, but here the situation in China becomes much more complicated. Surviving very effec- tively with no external creator and no conceptual absolute, the authority was necessarily invested in the past. Com- mitted to changefulness as permanence, yet equally committed to its own history, the Chinese tradition put much effort into delineating a concept of lineage as a sequence of transformations. Thus, in a chronological participation, the past was at once more immediate and the present less insular than was normal in the West. The manner in which a style referred to the past was quite different from that in the West, because it was probably impossible for any style not to refer to the past. Finally, in the aspect of cultural norm, the morphological values cen- tered in the European and Chinese tra- ditions seem to be a polar reversal. In both traditions the dynamics of opposi- tion were vital in sustaining the signifi- cance of a basic cultural choice, but in China choices were not opposed in the characteristically Western sense of ex- clusivity, and the polarity of yin-yang never yielded fully to the duality of subject and object. The consciousness was of complementary rather than exclusive dualities. Order and fidelity to nature were rarely seen as critically opposed, since nature was usually per- ceived in its very function as par- adigmatic order. Instead, the critical tensions were between permanence/ potentiality/inner and transience/actu- ality/outer. In this aspect, Chinese art may have departed most radically from the classical Western pattern. Notes 1 At a very different level, the issue of legitimacy is still very relevant here. But see an excellent discussion of Ch'en Hung-shou's archaism and the question of irony, in James Cahill, The Compelling Image: Nature and Style in Seven- Spring 1988 33</page><page sequence="9">teenth-Century Chinese Painting, Cambridge, Mass., 1982, ch. 3. 2 Published in Proceedings of the International Symposium on Chinese Painting, Taipei, National Palace Museum, 1972, pp. 143-210. 3 As delineated in The Classic, Cambridge, Mass., 1983; see also: Forms of Attention, Chicago, 1985. This association emerges strongly in the group of essays published in this issue of Art Journal. 4 For a fascinating study of legitimate lineage in the political sphere, see: Howard J. Wechsler, Offerings of Jade and Silk: Ritual and Symbol in the Legitimation of the T'ang Dynasty, New Haven, 1985. 5 See: Cahill (cited n. 1). 6 It is hard to keep the discussion in bounds here. I have outlined my own views on this subject, in "Values and History in Chinese Painting, I: Hsieh Ho Revisited," Res, 6 (Autumn 1983), pp. 72-111, and "II: The Hierarchic Evolution of Structure," Res, 7/8 (Spring/Autumn 1984). 7 E.

If any discussion results, I hope to emerge wiser. 13 As analyzed extensively by, among many oth- ers, Stephen Toulmin, Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts, Princeton, 1972. 14 See extensively: Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China, Cambridge, 1954 onwards, for example, vol.

There is now considerable interest in demonstrating that the study of geometry in China was also significant, but the fundamental algebraic orientation does not seem to be in question. 15 For a discussion of Early Spring as an imperial symbol, see: Sofukawa Hiroshi, "Rinzen kochi, Sbshunzu yorimita Kaku Ki no sansui yoshi- ki," in Asia ni okeru sansui hybgen ni tsuite, Kyoto National Museum and the Taniguchi Foundation, International Symposium on Art some level in every Chinese landscape. This essay does not attempt to deal with these dis- continuities, either in general terms or in more particular, such as the social hierarchies so clear in many Chinese landscape paintings. 17 Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, trans.

I quoted these same two passages during the 1985 Annual Meeting of the College Art Association, in a session organized by James Cahill and Martin Powers. Although it may be overindulgent to repeat them, I do so because the implications of the contrast are so extraordinarily rich that it deserves a wider scrutiny. 18 Reflections on Things at Hand: The Neo- Confucian Anthology, trans.

See the review by Christoph Harbsmeier, in Early China, 9-10 (1983-85), But Hansen's study is a sophisticated articulation of an uneducated conviction that I have long held. It is notable that almost all scholars in Chinese linguistics are forced to deal with this issue, and tend to disagree passionately. 21 See: Hay (cited n. 6), II, p. 128. 22 Direct and indirect consideration of these issues has been an important theme in recent sinology, such as that of Needham. See the fundamental study: Benjamin I. Schwarz, The World of Thought in Ancient China, Cam- bridge, Mass., 1985: "When one speaks here of the early emergence in the high culture of a concept of all-embracing order, one must be extremely cautious about certain Western notions triggered by terms such as 'order' or 'structure.' 'Order' immediately suggests 'ra- tionality' and rationality immediately suggests a reductionist rationalism which drives gods and spirits out of nature and deals only with abstract 'entities of reason.'" Schwarz con- tinues with some interesting observations on the "very limited development of anthropomor- phism" in early China (pp. 32-33). Schwarz, however, does not agree with Hansen (cited n. 19). 23 Hansen (cited n. 19), p. 31. 24 Hua-yii lu, trans.
