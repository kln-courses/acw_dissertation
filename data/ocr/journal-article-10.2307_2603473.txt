<plain_text><page sequence="1">8*. The World as I See It. By Albert Einstein. Translated by Alan Harris. 1935. (London : John Lane. Demy 8vo. 214 pp. 8s. Gd.) Nearly one-half of this book is caviare to the general and must have been very difficult to translate : the mathematical theory, for example, of tea-leaves in a cup, or the description of how Kepler arrived at the shape of the earth's orbit. The larger half is a collection of papers, letters and jottings illustrative of the great scientist's out? look on some of the problems of life. They give an impression of almost whimsical simplicity (e.g., regarding the economics of over- production) combined with a happy idealism and a passionate love of Nature. Einstein describes himself as a solitary creature, a mystic with democracy as his politics and militarism as his anathema. In a sense he claims to be a deeply religious man : he has no belief in an anthropomorphic God, punishing or rewarding man for predestined acts; but he lives " in rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection." There are flashes of humour too, as in his reflections on interviewers, and in his " Reply to the Women of America." The Nazi movement is not mentioned; but there is an interesting analysis of the Jewish mind and ideals. Meston.</page></plain_text>
