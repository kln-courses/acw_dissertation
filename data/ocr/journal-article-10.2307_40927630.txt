Extending the Durkheimian approach to nature, crime, law, and social control, this study discusses the anguish and anger provoked by the infraction, tributes to the fallen animal, calls for more severe and certain sanctions for poaching, and the boundaries affirmed in the incident's aftermath. The implications of this communal response to a wildlife offense for criminalization and conceptions of community are considered. Nature is being re-enchanted, reinvested with spirit, and recast as sacred (Gibson 2009). This diffuse but vitally felt sensibility is apparent in the reverential way growing numbers of people talk about nature; in assorted attempts to commune with nonhuman animals; in measures undertaken to preserve and restore the natural world; and, more generally, in envisioning a "new covenant between people, land, and creatures" (Gibson 2009:12). The sociologically intimate tie between a society's conception of the good and the forms that deviance assume in its midst (Alexander 2001) implies that nature's veneration will also heighten sensitivity to practices that desecrate it. Focusing on an infamous instance of poaching, this study examines the connec- tion between one community's re-enchantment of nature and its response to an assault on an evocative symbol of the natural world. The incident occurred on November 11, 1995, on the grounds of the YMCA of the Rockies, located just outside Estes Park, Colorado, when an elk was killed by a bolt fired from a high-powered crossbow. The shooting was illegal, and six days later, a man was arrested and charged with the willful destruction of wildlife, a class-five felony. News about the infraction spread quickly by word of mouth and within a day or two the media, local and national, provided extensive coverage. The crime galvanized the Estes Valley, and people who had known one another only in passing or not at all found themselves working together closely on a variety of initiatives. The collective response to this offense affords an opportunity to broaden the scope of sociological studies of crime, punishment, law, and boundaries. We begin by out- lining the conceptual framework that informs this investigation.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK A Durkheimian perspective frames this study. Although many criticisms have been directed at Durkheim's approach,1 elements of his theorizing - especially his contention that illegal and untoward behavior, law, and social control are permeated by emotion, morality, symbolism, and ritual (Smith and Alexander 2005:27; Strenski 2006:270- 302) - highlight aspects of societal responses to crime and deviance neglected by other sociological traditions. Durkheim ([1893] 1984:38-9) characterizes crime as an act that violates "strong, well-defined states of the collective conscience" When a collectivity punishes crime, it avenges transgressions against beliefs widely and deeply held and marks its normative boundaries (Durkheim [1893] 1984:58, 62-3). The righteous anger animating the urge to punish revitalizes the sentiment(s) vitiated by crime and maintains "inviolate the cohesion of society" (Durkheim [1893] 1984:63). Western modernity's reconstitution of the collective conscience spurs significant alterations in crime, punishment, and law. All social systems, Durkheim ([1912] 1995) maintains, rest on religious-like foundations (Alexander 1988a). Conceptualized socio- logically, religion is "nothing more than a body of collective beliefs and practices endowed with a certain authority" (Durkheim [1898] 1973a:50). At the center of the common conscience in modern, western societies is the "cult of the individual" or the "religion of humanity," wherein the "human person is considered sacred in the ritual sense of the word ..." and "man [sic] is at once the worshipper and the god" (Durkheim [1898] 1973a:46). "No mere drawing-room theory," this cult increasingly suffused the institutions and mores of late 19th- and early 20th-century western Europe, prompting Durkheim ([1898] 1973a:46-7) to remark that it "has blended with our whole life, and if, truly, we had to give it up, we would have to recast our whole moral organization at the same stroke." With this doctrine's institutionalization, the number of offenses against the person proscribed by criminal law rises exponentially, while the most repres- sive penalties are reserved for violent assaults on individuals. Its growing prominence is apparent, too, in greater sympathy for the offender, a fellow human being after all, and, relative to the horrific sanctions seared into the flesh of the condemned in absolutist states and in some traditional communities, in reductions in the intensity of punish- ment (Durkheim [1901] 1973b). Modernity also transforms the administration of justice. In small, traditional social orders, serious offenses precipitate spontaneous assemblages that concentrate "honest consciousnesses together" to express a shared indignation (Durkheim [1893] 1984:63). However, as societies modernize they differentiate, and tasks previously performed by multifunctional entities are increasingly fulfilled by specialized institutions. With regard to social control, primary responsibility for the apprehension, adjudication, and punishment of lawbreakers shifts from the community as a whole to distinct agencies 356 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="3">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson such as police, courts, and prisons. The formalization of rules whose infringement offends society is also allocated to separate structures, including legislatures and other government bodies. Typically employed to study offenses against persons and the public order (of human communities) and societal reactions to these violations, Durkheim's approach can also be used to examine contemporary collectivities' responses, punitive and otherwise, to crimes against nature and nonhuman animals. However, extending the model's substantive scope in this fashion requires modifying the original framework in four ways. The first revision borrows selectively from Weber's ([1922] 1946:148-9) discussion of modernity's "polytheism" to contextualize Durkheim's claims about the religion of humanity.2 The differentiation, diversity, and dynamism inherent in modern social orders, in conjunction with the open-ended character of sacralization - that is, Durkheim's observation that sacredness can be ascribed to nearly anything, whether a cross, a piece of cloth, a body of water, even excrement (Fields 1995:xlvii) - fuels the circulation of multiple belief systems, each extolling different idols. The cult of the individual, then, is but one of many religious-like dogmas in contemporary western societies, albeit the one claiming the largest number of, and the most fervent, followers. We propose that a Durkheimian cult of nature wherein the natural world and nonhu- man life forms are objects of a generalized regard represents another quasi- religious creed, although one decidedly secondary to the religion of humanity. The religion of nature, as crystallized in the United States, is of relatively recent vintage, at least among settlers of European extraction and their descendants. For many immigrants, nature was dangerous and foreboding, a foe to be vanquished and bent to human purpose (Thomas 1983:17-50). This view prevailed for nearly 400 years, but by the mid- 19th-century prominent dissidents began reimagining nature, vesting it with cognitive, aesthetic, moral, and spiritual value. The leading figures were intellectuals, and the vanguard-like role they played in clarifying moral individualism (Durkheim [1898] 1973a:55-57) was reprised in systematizing and sacralizing ideas about the natural world (Philippon 2004). Muir and other iconic American natural- ists, including Thoreau, Emerson, Melville, Whitman, Leopold, and Carson, invented "an entirely new vocabulary and grammar of the wild, a language that powered the conservation and later the environmental movement through the first century of their respective existences" (McKibben 2001:xiii). Similarly, generations of natural scientists, from Darwin to the present, have advanced not only secular accounts of the natural world but a reverential regard for that world and all that inhabit it (e.g., Wilson 2006). One such account, the Gaia theory, envisions the earth as animate, "an ensemble of living and non-living components that acts as a single self-regulating system," a char- acterization which, stressing humans' "embeddedness within the earthly web of life," renders people "inseparable from the whole of nature" (Harding 2006:64, 28-29). Challenging the presumption that humans' purportedly unique capacities elevate them far above other animals, pioneering academics have discovered traces of lan- guage, culture, morality, and self in other species; advanced the notion of animal The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 357</page><page sequence="4">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield rights; and pondered people's ethical obligations to nature and other life forms (e.g., Sanders and Arluke 1993; Singer [1975] 2002; Alger and Alger 2003; Light and Rolston 2003; Irvine 2004; Bekoff and Pierce 2009). Elements of popular culture, too, venerate nature. Edu-entertainment programs aired on the Discovery, Nature, and Animal Planet channels and widely circulated DVDs - Journey to Planet Earth; The National Parks; Life; Oceans - Trumpet the Natural World's Wonders. A controversial thesis maintains that Bambi and other staples of Disney animation convey a fundamental respect for nature (Whitley 2008). Nature virtuosos like Ed Abbey and naturalists such as Jane Goodall have been cast as folk heroes, while a spate of biographies, memoirs, and an occasional movie sound the Thoreauian theme of self-discovery in the wild and hail the restorative powers of forests, deserts, jungles, mountains, and seas (e.g., Krakauer 1996). An examination of popular and scholarly discourses intuits an increasingly compassionate stance toward other animals, with contemporary social orders eschewing an anthropocentric, instru- mental conception of the nonhuman in favor of a "zoocentric empathy" (Franklin 1999:175). No mere drawing-room theory, naturalism has been institutionalized. This cult has mobilized individuals and communities to act in environmentally responsible ways, spawned broad-based conservation, preservation, and environmental movements, and fueled such organizations as the Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, and Wilderness Society and their lobbying arms (Gibson 2009:6-8). Its sentiments have spurred litiga- tion and have been partially inscribed in law. Although differing in important ways, the Wilderness Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, and the National Environmental Policy Acts - to mention just a few well-known federal measures - all aim at protecting the natural world, a project shored up with sanctions against actions which damage that world. If the first revision describes accretions to the contemporary common conscience Durkheim did not anticipate, the next two turn to Durkheim's later work to redress some of the omissions and specious contentions in The Division of Labor in Society (DLS)y often treated as his paradigmatic statement on crime, punishment, and law. We recommend supplementing the traditional Durkheimian focus on the anger and puni- tive impulse provoked by crime with consideration of the anguish experienced when violations damage revered objects and the complementary yearning to lament the loss. The latter are illuminated by Durkheim's ([1912] 1995:392-417) analysis of how col- lectivities respond to diminishment by assembling together. Of course, neither the shared feelings of despondency nor the regenerative rituals displace outrage at the offender or the desire to punish. Even with "normal deaths," grief is accompanied by anger and the urge to strike out at something (Durkheim [1912] 1995:404), and such fury only intensifies when death or serious injury results from foul play rather than natural causes. But to acknowledge that these processes interpenetrate is not to say they are the same thing: sorrow and mourning differ qualitatively from anger and punish- ment and they incline collectivities toward a distinct genre of rites aimed at "communing in sadness" (Durkheim [1912] 1995:405). 358 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="5">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson Third, the ties posited in DLS between social sentiments, on the one hand, and law, crime, and punishment, on the other, require reconsideration. Qualifying the position presented in DLS (Durkheim [1893] 1984:24-9) that casts law as an accurate reflection and as a tangible indicator of elusive, underlying social sentiments and bonds, Durkheim ([1897] 1951:314-5) subsequently acknowledges that a gap frequently exists between modern statutory law and the more "mobile" currents of moral reality from which it springs but does not supplant. Legal precepts never perfectly mirror "actual living sentiments," but only sum them up "as in a superficial envelope" (Durkheim [1897] 1951:315). What is true for law on the books is also true for the law in action. For a variety of reasons, legal rules may be implemented in a manner regarded as overly zealous by significant segments of the public; in other instances, enforcement may appear too lax, there is a seeming "systematic waiver of sanctions, and law is transgressed with impunity" (Dahrendorf 1985:20). These considerations point to the possibility that collective enmity can be enflamed not only by crime but also by legal codes' and social control agents' perceived failure to honor community sentiment. Elaborating Durkheim's boundary maintenance thesis, a fourth revision encour- ages exploration of the various ways in which shared beliefs, temporarily weakened by crime, are refortified. Contrast conceptions (Shibutani 1970) highlighting purportedly stark moral differences between the offended and the offender, for example, comprise a crucial boundary-marking mechanism. Serious breaches sometimes spawn invidious comparisons that stamp the violated as the embodiment of the community's concep- tion of the good and the violator as emblematic of its conception of evil (Alexander 2001). With the wronged and the culprit symbolically constituted as diametrically opposed coordinates in moral space (Erikson 1966), the collectivity buttresses its boundaries through gestures of identification with, and sympathy for, the injured and gestures of dis-identification with, and revulsion for, the perpetuator. That is, senti- ments are revivified through both an affirmation (figuratively embracing the "good" victim) and a negation (figuratively repudiating the "evil" offender) (Douglas 1966). Further, given the fluid and overlapping character of distinct currents of sentiment in contemporary social systems, crimes and the societal reactions they provoke will likely implicate multiple constellations of intensely held beliefs. Consequently, in addition to precipitating pejorative contrasts between the aggrieved and the guilty, a single griev- ous offense tends to generate subsidiary dichotomies. A plurality of contrasts - each configured as opposing coordinates in moral space - will likely surface, and the com- munity will be pressed to endorse the essential integrity of both the principal and the secondary antinomies. DATA AND METHODS This study commenced after hearing, on local radio, a Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW) official recount the poaching of an elk in Estes Park and the community's response to the offense. Interested in exploring the role of animals and nature in crime, The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 359</page><page sequence="6">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield punishment, law, and the construction of moral boundaries (Erikson 1966; Thompson 1975), we visited Estes several times and gathered information about this incident from a variety of sources. The primary data for this study are 28 in-depth interviews and over 200 print media stories. Stretching from two to four hours, the interviews (all audio recorded and subsequently transcribed) addressed a range of issues - for example, the meanings ascribed to the slain elk; the shooting itself; individual and collective reactions to the infraction; and how the Valley's natural environs and its nonhuman inhabitants give shape to residents' and visitors' everyday experiences (Latour 1993; Irvine 2004; Jerolmack 2007, 2008). We employed a snowball sampling technique, asking each respondent to recommend others whom we might interview. The sample included staff members of the Estes YMCAj Valley residents; Department of Wildlife (DOW) officials who investigated the crime; the lead prosecutor in the case; the suspect's defense attor- ney; and the Estes Park mayor at the time of the shooting. While nearly all respondents were residing in Estes when the offense occurred, their level of involvement in the communal response to this violation varied from extensive to little or none. The 212 articles, editorials, and opinion pieces from local and statewide newspapers supplied valuable background material about Estes Park and details about the crime. These media accounts broadened the sample of responses to the offense, supplied a reliable chronology of key developments in the case, and identified actors, individual and collective, who assumed leadership roles in the community's reaction to this incident. We secured additional information about the shooting and about the Valley by examining a Web site established shortly after the incident. We reviewed all of the site's 364 postings, which included news articles, updates on the legal case against the suspect, and comments from readers. We also examined two videos. The first, a reenactment of the crime, was prepared by DOW and was submitted as evidence to the Larimer County District Attorney's Office. (Estes Park is located in Larimer County.) The second, a 30-minute retrospective of the stricken elk's life, was produced by a professional photographer. From the Colorado State Archives we assembled data from the legislative hearings that preceded passage of an anti-poaching bill. We reviewed drafts of the statute and dubbed audiotapes from all legislative committee deliberations on the measure. In conjunction with state legislators' comments and votes, we studied the testimonies provided by various constituencies, including government and law enforcement offi- cials, along with various citizen groups and individuals. These remarks, together with lawmakers' discussions, were transcribed.3 In addition, observational data were collected. We visited the Estes Valley on 14 different occasions, paying particular attention to the actual and symbolic presence of elk and other wildlife. We walked through the town with residents and tourists and inspected the merchandise sold in several shops. We attended the annual "Elk Fest," which sponsors educational seminars about elk and tours in open-bed trucks to view local herds. These firsthand observations were supplemented with other materials that 360 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="7">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson describe the town and surrounding area and advertise local establishments' goods and services - two DVDs about Estes Park; the official Web sites of Estes Park (nearby) Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and (nearby) Roosevelt National Forest (RNF); and over three dozen brochures picked up from the Estes Park Visitors Center. On five different occasions, we spent the night at Estes Park Y cabins. During daylight, we toured the Y grounds, RMNP, and RNF, recording observations about the terrain and wildlife. In the evening, we reviewed the journals housed in the cabins, each journal containing pages of previous guests' reflections about their visits. These data were initially arranged under very broad categories derived from the conceptual framework outlined in the preceding section. Following this preliminary sorting, we sifted through the data in a more detailed way, generating both relatively specific codes and more abstract ones as well (Coffey and Atkinson 1996; Corbin and Strauss 2008). Patterns emerging from several readings of these data enabled us to draw connections between these codes (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Charmaz 2006). At the same time, these links were constructed with an eye to our orienting analytic concerns, and the findings are presented in terms of substantive themes tied to these more general issues. An overview of the community and its relationship to elk precedes our presentation of these themes. THE SETTING: ESTES AND AN ELK The modern collective conscience is, relative to its traditional counterpart, formulated in a more general, universalistic way (Durkheim [1893] 1984:229-33), but its creeds are unevenly institutionalized. Although commanding near-unanimous assent in the United States, the moral individualism Durkheim championed was, and is, enacted more faithfully in some settings and by some groups than others. Similarly, while contemporary naturalism, when articulated in the abstract, garners widespread support (Kempton, Boster, and Hartley 1996:1 13; Barton 2004:9), its influence on social practice varies substantially. In certain locales, naturalism has little discernable effect on people's conduct, and the natural world and the nonhuman are discounted or are valued pri- marily for the immediate, tangible benefits they afford human communities (e.g., Egan 2006). In other areas, a generalized regard for nature is refracted across "imagined geographies" (e.g., Wolch and Emel 1998; Philo and Wilbert 2000) that normatively pair select forms of nature and animals with putatively appropriate places - for example, cities and suburbs are the proper province of flower gardens and cats; farms and ranches are home to large tracts of land and livestock; the wilderness is where forests and wolves belong. Still other settlements, such as "Childerley" (Bell 1994), embrace nature more fully, and their residents endeavor to protect it, relax prevailing imagined geographies' customary couplings of place to animals and nature, and understand themselves as part of an encompassing, purifying natural world. Estes Park, like Childerley, reveres its natural surrounds. In a myriad of ways, Estes, a well-to-do mountain community of approximately 5,500 (with another 3,500 residing in parts of the Valley outside of town), announces an ardent affinity for nature. Estes's The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 361</page><page sequence="8">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Web site heralds the town's proximity to nature and some of "the most spectacular scenery in the Rocky Mountains" (Public Information Office, Town of Estes Park 2008). A brochure likens the Y grounds to a "slice of heaven," where people's spirits are renewed in a "pristine mountain setting" (YMCA of the Rockies 2004-05). Rocky Mountain National Park, a "crown jewel" of the national park system, abuts the Y and Estes, and a link from the town's Web site invokes Edenic imagery to describe the Park: "Above, azure blue is permanently etched with craggy peaks extending notched, key-like protrusions into a perfect sky. ..." (Estes Park Convention and Visitors Bureau 2008). Nature at its more untrammeled exists beyond the town's perimeter, but cultivated forms and idyllic representations of the natural world pervade Estes. The downtown core is lined with aspen groves, beds of mountain flowers, and a landscaped, riverside garden. Public sculptures showcase eagles, elk, and bighorn sheep as well as the area's most renowned human figure, Enos Mills, widely known as "the John Muir of the Rockies." There is near unanimity, among visitors and residents alike, about the area's ability to evoke a sense of communion, a powerfully felt connection to a natural world that partakes of the transcendent (Gibson 2009:252-3). Each journal housed in the five Y cabins we rented contained, on average, 82 separate entries and 153 written pages. Common themes included sibling spats, riotous board games (there are no televisions in the cabins), favorite restaurants, and shopping bonanzas. But nearly all previous guests' musings also alluded to the Valley's enchanting beauty and struggled to articulate the sense of having glimpsed "a numinous world beyond our own" (Gibson 2009:11). In a typical entry, a Coloradoan wrote, "It is a blessing to be surrounded by God's beautiful and glorious creation." An Australian exclaimed, "What a thrill to travel half way round the world to stay in such a stunning place." The residents we interviewed were even more enthralled with the environs. The town's proximity to nature, several said, had figured prominently in their decision to move to Estes, and they felt "fortunate" and "blessed" to live in a place they characterized as a "gift," a "treasure," and something they "appreciate every day." While the mountains and lakes, meadows and moose, wildflowers and Ponderosa pine - all mentioned repeatedly in the journals and by our respondents - are integral aspects of the Valley's wilderness aesthetic, none of them generate as much excitement as the area's large elk herd. American attitudes toward elk and other charismatic mega- fauna (e.g., bears, cougars, wolves), widely perceived as beautiful, mysterious, romantic and, perhaps, dangerous, are, in general, exceedingly favorable (Kellert 1997), and in Estes, a heightened regard for wildlife is, despite occasional grumblings about elks' insatiable appetite for homeowners' shrubbery and lawns and the ever-present drop- pings, woven into the fabric of community life. From the mid-1980s to 1995, one particular elk elicited an extraordinary level of attention and affection. He was, some claimed, "the largest elk in Colorado" (Pankratz and McPhee 1995: IB), and was so gigantic - standing more than six feet (without his antlers), weighing approximately 1,000 pounds, and crowned by an enormous (9 x 8) rack - that even the most untutored eye could see he was different from the others. 362 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="9">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson A fixture in the area, he roamed the Valley for much of the year and "wintered," from November to April, at the Y camp, where staff and visitors interacted with him on a regular basis. This animal had a name: people called him "Samson," or "Sam" for short.4 Many Estes residents and vacationers claimed a close relationship with Samson, a bond they described as intrinsically rewarding, years-long in duration, and infused with emotion (Sanders 2003:405-6). Friend was the word they used most often to character- ize their relationship with the elk, but occasionally other phrases were employed - for example, neighbor, part of our community, and such kinship terms as member of the Estes Park family and wild brother. Complementing the terms were anthropomorphic imputations of stable traits and predilections. Samson "liked people," was "curious" about them, and "loved having his picture taken." People knowing Samson best objected when he was portrayed as a pet. Although regarding the elk as a friend and recognizing that while at the Y he had become human habituated, they also insisted that Samson was, at his very core, "wild." One man told a journalist, "He [Samson] was a wild animal who had this affinity for people and this place [the Y grounds]" (Tardani 1995a: 1 A). Locals and tourists explicitly referred to him as a "national celebrity" (Asbury 1995a: 1). He was a "must-see" on travelers' itineraries, especially for those staying at the YMCA. "For many, many people seeing Samson was part of coming to the Y," a staff member said. Similarly, before venturing out to the Rocky Mountain National Park in the fall, wildlife photographers from across the country contacted DOW's district manager to ask whether Samson was back at the Y (Hutchins 1995:1). He was photo- graphed by "thousands of guests" (Asbury 1995a:l) and, according to media accounts, was "the most photographed elk in the world" (Blumhardt 1995a:A6). Sightings of the big bull were energizing, stirring excited exclamations (e.g., "There's Samson!") and quickening the pace as people rushed to the area where the elk had been spotted. When passengers shouted and pointed to Samson, drivers slammed on the brakes and all jumped out of the car for a closer look. A wildlife rock star, Samson drew crowds. During a mountain hike, a Y employee saw Samson at the edge of a meadow sloshing in the mud, flipping bushes in the air and, generally, "having a good oP time." She was, however, not the only one entranced by the spectacle: "There had to be 150 people sitting on the rocks, just watching him." Encounters with Samson were suffi- ciently newsworthy that they merited mention in letters, emails, and phone calls to relatives and friends and so affecting that they became part of families' collective memory (Halbwachs [1925] 1992:54-83). "There was hardly a day that Samson's name did not arise in our conversation," a Texas couple remembered (Uthoff and Uthoff 1995:6). In addition to being a friend and a celebrity, Samson was a multivocal, redolent representation. One set of meanings revolved around his name, which while individu- alizing him (Sanders 2003:411) also inspired semiotic associations that tethered the elk to nature and myth, depicting him as a beastly incarnation of nobility, vested with primeval powers, natural virtue, and moral purity (e.g., Piper 1995:A4). Second, as the Samson-nature homology implies, this elk was ecomorphized,5 cast as the embodiment The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 363</page><page sequence="10">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield of the natural world, the wild, and the untamed environs (Granfield and Colomy 2005). While people anthropomorphized this animal, attributing human-like characteristics to him, they also ascribed ecological qualities to the elk, identifying Samson and, by extension, the persons observing him, with a natural world in which both human and animal are inseparable. His ecomorphization was sometimes generalized, the bull rep- resenting all of nature; more often, however, it was particularized, with friends and fans touting his totemic-like ties to the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, and the Estes Valley. Third, Samson served as an emblem of humans' desire to bond deeply with nature; he stood for an idea that many residents and visitors want to believe is true, viz., that humans can coexist with nature in a reasonably harmonious, respectful way. Indeed, people did not simply observe nature through Samson; while in his presence, they simultaneously experienced themselves as a part of nature. FINDINGS Mourning and Remembering When crime desecrates an object in which individuals and groups have invested con- siderable self-feeling, the ensuing sense of diminishment prompts communal action aimed at rejuvenating the demoralized (Durkheim [1912] 1995:415). Because Valley residents and visitors have no established rites for mourning the destruction of wildlife (or other objects in the natural world), their response to Samson's death was improvised and they registered, and overcame, their dis-spiriting sense of loss by creating artifacts, telling stories, and convening ceremonies. Mementos, Memorabilia, and Monuments Expressions of loss, tributes to Samson's nobility, and affirmations of what he meant to the human community - all these sentiments, often joined to outrage at the shooter and at poaching more generally, were "deposited in material things" (Durkheim [1897] 1951:314). Commemorative T-shirts and sweatshirts, with an artist's color rendition of Samson appearing on the front and accompanied by the words: "SAMSON; killed by a poacher, November 11, 1995," were sold at several local businesses. The advertisements for these articles, printed in bold, black letters in the Estes Park Trail-Gazette (Unknown Author (a) 1995:3) read, "Remember Samson . . . and help stop poaching! Purchase of this commemorative T-shirt/Sweatshirt will help make a statement about how impor- tant wildlife is to Estes Park and people around the world."6 Posters featuring an august Samson standing on the Y grounds, were produced and sold, and several years after his death still adorned residents' homes, places of business, and government offices. A Samson photograph served as the cover for the 1996-1997 Estes Park Telephone Direc- tory. Samson Stout, a limited edition first produced by the Estes Park Brewery shortly after Samson was killed, is reissued on the anniversary of his death. The elk's visage appeared on postcards, thank-you notes, and calendars, as well as on the flyers announc- ing Estes Park's annual Elk Fest. The Colorado DOW adopted Samson's image as its official logo. 364 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="11">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson Samson's antlers, head, and cape were mounted above a large fireplace in the Y's main lodge. This mount is no trophy; instead, it is a "memorial to the famed elk" ( Asbury 1995b:2) and is intended to educate the public about Samson, poaching, and humans' obligations to nature (Arluke 2006:165). Beside the mount is a large, framed picture of Samson and a plaque describing the elk in life and death. The inscription's last sentence reads, "It is our duty not only to admire but also to respect and protect wildlife." Samson was memorialized in bronze. A larger-than-life replica of Samson, roughly 11-feet tall and weighing over 2,200 pounds, was unveiled on September 11, 1997 and placed on a pedestal at the eastern gateway to Estes Park. The nonprofit Samson Sculp- ture Fund, established by an emergent group of commemorative agents (Schwartz 1991) calling itself the "Friends of Samson," helped defray the $55,600 cost of the artwork. A portion of the funds was generated from the sale of 50 miniatures of the sculpture; private donations, ranging from a few dollars up to $1,000 gifts, covered the balance. Over 330 people - local residents and individuals living in 24 other states - and dozens of organizations made contributions. During the sculpting, Carol Cunningham, the artist commissioned to craft the sculpture, submitted her work for periodic review to the Artistic Committee, a group comprised of local citizens. She also opened her studio to residents and tourists, inviting them to view and participate in the sculpting process. Cunningham recognized that aesthetics and an accurate representation of the original Samson were not the only, or even the principal, concern: " 'The more I got into it, the more I realized that need for healing in this town. There were a lot of people who were upset about Samson, and this is a way for them to heal' " (Tardani 1997a:A10). Unlike artistic renderings of wildlife in public settings where people may never have any contact with such animals (Sabloff 2001), this sculpture compels the viewer both to confront the assault on Samson and to consider the memorial's implicit claim - that Estes is a community which affirms, unequivocally, the intrinsic value of wildlife and the natural world. Stories After Samson's death, stories about him proliferated, spiking in the immediate after- math of the shooting but continuing to be told more than a decade later. Recounted in a variety of settings and through several media, these stories remain, some 15 years after the incident, an important current in the town's collective memory (Halbwachs [1950] 1980). At the Estes Park Elk Fest in 2004, Samson's head and cape, temporarily borrowed from the Y, were put on display and a speaker told an audience of roughly 200 about Samson and how he died. On that same day, at a public art show in town, near an exhibit showcasing landscape, wildlife, and nature paintings, lay a stack of one-page flyers bearing the title, "Samson's Story" (Unknown Author (b) n.d.). A brochure, prepared by the Samson Sculpture Fund (1996-7), included "The Story of Samson." The Estes Park Public Library compiled a Samson File, archiving an extensive collection of clippings about the elk. An authorized history of the YMCA of the Rockies, a copy of which is placed in every Estes Park Y cabin, includes a summary of what the authors call "The The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 365</page><page sequence="12">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Assassination of Samson" (Melton and Melton 2006:211). A popular history of Rocky Mountain National Park includes a chapter on Samson, the shooting, and its aftermath (Perry 2008:101-4). Samson stories served many purposes, three of which are especially significant sociologically. First, these stories were cathartic (Scheff 1979). They clarified what Samson meant to individuals and the larger community (Hochschild [1983] 2003:24- 34), acknowledged the finality of his death, and grieved his loss. An article published days after Samson died laments what had been lost: "This elegant elk will roam our valley no more and his bugling will no longer reverberate through our meadows" (Marshall 1995:3). In her letter to the editor, a woman remembers what a "nuisance" Samson could be, jumping over "the backyard fence to feast on the sod we had lain a few months earlier," and how "comical" her husband looked chasing off the elk while telling him, " 'Get outta here, you, I paid good money for that grass' " (Holt 1995:5). But Samson's death brought a realization. The sod was trivial; what truly mattered were Samson and the relationship she and her family had had with him: "Today I'd plant every blade by hand if I thought it would bring him back" (Holt 1995:5). Perhaps the most arresting story, at least visually, is "A Memorial Tribute to Samson," a 30-minute video prepared by a professional photographer (Tenderfoot Productions 1995). The tribute shows Samson resting on Y grounds, frolicking in meadows and ponds, and rumbling down a forested hillside. It spotlights the Rocky Mountains' rugged grandeur and brilliant fall colors, a seemingly perfect backdrop for Samson's natural grace and power. Supplementing the footage are testimonials from residents and vaca- tioners that speak directly to the loss many felt over Samson's death. A 40-something male, who lived at the Y and had interacted with Samson on a regular basis for several years, said, "I just miss that animal. I really do." Second, the stories were resurrective (Seale 1998:68-70, 193-211). While acknowl- edging and grieving his physical death, Samson's admirers refused to let him die socially. In a sense, every story about Samson, regardless of its content, fulfilled this purpose, the accounts, told again and again, breathing social life into the elk by keeping his name in symbolic circulation (Baudrillard 1993). But some stories killed death (Seale 1998:57- 59) more explicitly, highlighting the ways in which, and the places where, Samson lived on. An article largely devoted to grieving Samson concluded with imagery of life sus- tained: "Even though Samson is gone, his spirit will glide where he has been before and in the future on a cold, crispy fall night, if you will listen real closely, you can hear his mournful call through our valley" (Marshall 1995:3). Others cited more corporeal evidence of Samson's rebirth. The "Story of Samson" (Unknown Author (b) n.d.) asserts that "Samson's real memorials are undoubtedly all around us. As the largest bull elk that many can ever recall seeing, Samson's descendants are probably plentiful among the elk of the Estes Valley and Rocky Mountain National Park." Similarly, the video tribute concludes, "Samson is missed by us all. But we will continue to look for the glint of his eyes in the babies he left behind, as the circle of life continues." These words are accompanied, visually, by a procession of calves whom, the viewer is led to believe, might well be Samson's progeny. Adding precision to the 366 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="13">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson resurrective allusions, a journalist estimated that Samson was "probably responsible for somewhere between 70 and 90 offspring that carry his blood line" (Lee 1997:2). The bronze memorial, perhaps the single most tangible bid submitted on behalf of Samson's symbolic immortality (Becker 1973), spurred a spate of resurrective stories. Plans for the sculpture were announced by the Reporter-Herald under the heading, "Poached elk to live again in bronze" (Tardani 1997b:Al). The monument's unveiling was recounted in a front-page story of The Coloradoan printed beneath the title, "Statue puts Samson on a pedestal forever" (Persons 1997:1 A). Redemptive narratives describe how misfortune and suffering can be ultimately redeemed in some good thing that grows out of such adversity (Arluke 2006:164-8; McAdams 2006), and in Samson stories this motif was mentioned more often than either the cathartic or resurrective themes. Within hours after the shooting, many locals were already thinking in redemptive terms, one telling a reporter, " 'I want to do what- ever I can in a positive way to make sure something like this doesn't happen again' " (Blumhardt 1995a:A6). As months and years passed, stories highlighted developments - for example, people's greater willingness to alert authorities when they suspected a wildlife offense had occurred; an apparent decrease in the incidence of wildlife crime - that purportedly provided proof that something "good" had, in fact, come from this painful loss. Many of these accounts, including the following, explicitly mentioned "Samson's legacy": If any good can ever come from such a horrible tragedy, it is this. In a recent conversation with Rick Spowart, District Wildlife Manager for the Colorado Divi- sion of Wildlife, he reported there was no evidence of poaching in the Estes Valley last winter. This is Samson's legacy. It's up to us to see that it lives on. (Lee 1997:2) Ceremonies Ceremonial events marked important developments in the community's response to the Samson shooting while also bringing a sense of closure, emotional and legal, to its unsettling effects. At the sentencing hearing for the man who shot Samson, for example, a Y employee's remarks joined an ecomorphized conception of the elk to the profound sense of loss he and others felt: Samson was a beautiful elk of magnificent proportions. He was an icon of sorts. He represented the mystery, purity, beauty, and serenity of the protected Rocky Moun- tains in which he lived, an area considered by many to be sacred. An area in which people seek refuge from the chaos and crime of the city. Hundreds of thousands of children and adults marveled at his beauty and his mystery. He was a common focal point for thousands of individuals of varied backgrounds from this country and across the world. Mr Francis took from our society that common icon. (Boyd 1996) Other ceremonial occasions acknowledged the loss but gave more attention to how the town's mobilized response had reaffirmed its commitment to nature and wildlife and its antipathy to poaching. At an award ceremony, the DOW director and the Estes Park mayor copresented a T-shirt, plaque, and citation "for contributing to the preser- vation of Colorado's wildlife" to the 15-year-old who reported the offense to authorities The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 367</page><page sequence="14">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield (Hutchins 1996:3). Remarks delivered during the ceremony applauded citizens' and officials' resolute action, commending it as an effective antidote to the demoralizing impact of the Samson shooting. At a dedication ceremony, the mayor unveiled the Samson statue to an enthusiastic audience. As officials struggled to remove the tarp, "There was sporadic clapping, and lots of appreciative 'oohs' and 'aahs' from the crowd" (Persons 1997:1 A). The sculptor believed the monument's "heroic size" did justice to Samson's larger-than-life persona (Tardani 1997c:A3), while spectators offered alternative interpretations of the memori- al's meaning. For a resident of nearby Boulder, the piece "is representative of a thing that is wild and what we all love about Colorado" (Persons 1997:1). For others, the bronze stood sentry-like at the community's entrance, conveying a warning that "Estes Park is not a poacher-friendly town" (Tardani 1997c:A3). Punitive Passions7 The anger aroused by an offense is not always directly exclusively at the perpetuator. When the official response to a jarring violation and the statute bearing on the breach are widely perceived as abrogating community sentiment, then social control agents and the law itself are also likely targets of public indignation. In the Samson case, an unsettling crime spawned denunciation of the assailant, outrage at the authorities and the law, and an increase in the severity and certainty of punishment. Excoriating the Offender Samson's slaying, which occurred on Y grounds, struck many Estes residents and tour- ists as an especially egregious transgression. The YMCA strictly prohibits hunting on its private property, affirms a commitment to preserving the natural world, and relishes its proximity to wilderness and wildlife. Its employees and guests were repulsed by an act that, many believed, conveyed contempt for their core convictions. Those who lived or worked at the Y, or who visited regularly, and who were attached to Samson, considered the crime an attack on them too. "It's almost like one of your family was assaulted or raped or something," said a Y staffer. Elaborating the parallel, a colleague likened the shooter to a "robber": He came into our home, he came into the Y grounds, he broke into it like he broke into a home and he killed something that was very dear to all of us. I feel myself getting angry now. And that's why I think we were so angry about this: not only did he kill Samson, but he violated us. The shooter was rhetorically eviscerated by the press and the public, labeled as "public enemy number one" (Asbury 1995a:l), "one of the most reviled villains in the state" (C. Roberts 1995:1A), and "the lowest form of life" (Tardani 1995a:Al). A respon- dent recollected that at a town meeting convened shortly after the incident a participant remarked, "We ought to make that low-life scumball run naked across town through a gauntlet to see if he could live." "I've received so many calls - people are just irate, wanting to throw the book at him," said DOW's district manager (Newcomer 1995a: IB). As news of the crime spread, DOW officials received three death threats against the 368 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="15">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson as-yet unidentified perpetuator and, taking these threats seriously, officials refused to release his name to the press for several days. Animus at the Authorities and the Law Umbrage was also aimed at prosecutors and, especially, judges, who, it was said, dis- counted the seriousness of wildlife offenses. The district attorney's office was lambasted for its perceived unwillingness to seek maximum penalties against poachers. Judges were reproached for their failure to appreciate the gravity of these transgressions, and for routinely offering reduced sanctions and, all too frequently, imposing no punishment whatsoever. Such prosecutorial and judicial laxity and their apparent disregard for residents' and visitors' abhorrence over poaching, some said, was "a crime in itself" (Asbury 1995a:2), and roused an ire similar to that voiced by humane law enforcement officers upon learning that courtroom officials regularly diminish the significance of animal cruelty cases (Arluke 2004:131-55). An organizer of a town meeting hoped that the community's overwhelming anti-poaching sentiment "will begin to send a message to public prosecutors and judges that Estes Park-area residents will have zero tolerance for poachers" (Asbury 1995a:2). That message became a virtual refrain, and the notion that justice officials penalized poachers with little more than a "slap on the wrist" was echoed in a variety of venues. A typical posting on the Samson Web site, established shortly after the shooting, expressed the exasperation many felt about what they per- ceived as social control agents' tepid response to wildlife offenders: "I'm sick and tired of hearing about the cowardly crime of poaching being prosecuted with all the enforce- ment of a parking ticket" (Laakkonen 1995). Citizens were also perturbed with DOW. As news of the shooting circulated, resi- dents urged DOW officials to bring in the suspect. At a town meeting, DOW's district manager was "grilled" by "130 irate citizens" demanding to know why the poacher had not yet been apprehended. One participant "fumed" at the officer: "You know who did it. You have his truck, the weapon, the dead elk - what's missing? Why can't you arrest the man?" (Blumhardt 1995b:Al). On the same day Samson was killed, another man was arrested for poaching three elk in Estes Park. In early December 1995, DOW's district manager recommended imposing the minimum fines, telling the court that the man did not realize he had hit three animals because the first two did not fall immediately after being shot. "I believe that what he did was unintentional, but it was definitely illegal, so I felt the minimum was reasonable," the manager explained (Tardani 1995b:3A). The officer's comments, published in newspapers across the state, rankled many in and outside the Valley, and a Colorado couple fired off an angry letter to DOW's acting director: With statements [like the district manager's] from the very AUTHORITIES charged with protecting our wildlife, how can there be any doubt why poaching is rampant? . . . You just don't get it, do you? Well, let me tell you: Coloradoans are fed up with that attitude and the leniency toward these criminals.

Wake up! Times have changed! (Oliver and Oliver 1995; emphasis in original) The law itself was rebuked, with several groups and individuals decrying existing penalties against poaching as too anemic to curb the practice. This view was sometimes advanced in extreme language, with letters to the editor and, especially, Samson Web site commentary, demanding the death penalty for crimes against wildlife or opining that poachers be "hung" (A. Roberts 1995), "shot on site" ( Jacobson 1996), or "hunted down the way they hunted down Samson" (Parnés 1995). More common, however, were impassioned pleas for Colorado to "take the lead in passing realistic anti-poaching legislation that is severe enough to discourage this despicable act" (Mikesh 1995). Watchdogging the Justice System; Changing the Law Infuriated with the suspect and vexed by the justice system and the law, residents wrote letters, made phone calls, and sent faxes to local district attorneys, judges, and state lawmakers, urging swift prosecution and hefty punishment for poachers. Paper and electronic copies of a "Petition to Prosecute All Poachers to the Full Extent of the Law" that read, in part - "We the undersigned . . . implore you to prosecute poachers as the criminals they are, and to pursue maximum sentences for those who are convicted" - were signed by over 300 people and delivered to Larimer County's district attorneys and judges. Scores of letters, some including over 100 signatures, condemning poaching and demanding harsh penalties, were sent to justice officials. Remarking on the "visibility this one case has created," Larimer County's chief district attorney noted that his office "had been flooded with letters urging prosecution of [the shooter]" (Pankratz 1995:20A). On the day Samson was killed, an alleged drunk driver ran a stop sign in Ft. Collins (also in Larimer County) and killed another motorist. "We didn't get any letters insisting on vigorous prosecution on that," the chief DA said. "But we did on Samson" (Tardani 1995c:A3). Skeptical about the courts' willingness to treat poaching offenses seriously, several individuals at a town meeting vowed "to follow the [Samson] case through the courts in hopes of encouraging stiff sentencing" (Newcomer 1995b: IB), and a small band of residents attended every public hearing as the case wound its way through the legal system. Samson partisans spoke to reporters regularly, offering their opinions about the proceedings and hoping that their media-conveyed concerns would be taken into con- sideration by the district attorney and the judge. During the preliminary hearing, a mother and her two children staged a mini-protest outside the courthouse, their signs and chants denouncing poaching and calling for severe punishment of the suspect (Porter 1996:1A). Concerned citizens were not the only ones monitoring the proceed- ings: local and state media, print and electronic, along with the regularly updated Samson Web site, broadcast detailed reports on every phase of the legal process, from arrest through sentencing. Columnists and editorial pages weighed in on the case, encouraging authorities to proceed rapidly and to impose the most unsparing penalties permitted by law. 370 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="17">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson Samson became the state's "poster animal" for poaching, a common reference point for public discussion and a primary impetus for doing something about what many believed was a serious and growing problem. In 1998, Colorado legislators and the governor, acknowledging that the incident had crystallized citizens' revulsion over wild- life crime and the justice system's lackluster response to it, approved "Samson's Law." A DOW memo (Lewis and Smith 1998), transmitted to lawmakers, hunting and wildlife organizations, and the general public, explained the measure's origins: The bill was written in response to the poaching of Samson It's more than appropriate to stiffen penalties for those who think nothing of slaughtering wildlife simply because they want a hunting trophy. That's why Mark Udall [then a Boulder- based state representative whose district included Estes Park] introduced a bill to establish harsher penalties for trophy poaching. The new law added significant surcharges for poaching select trophy- sized wildlife. For example, "illegally taking" (the legislative phrase for poaching) a trophy-sized bull elk, like Samson, incurs a surcharge of $10,000 that is added to the existing fine of $1,000 and the possibility of a prison term, while poaching a trophy-sized bighorn sheep incurs a $25,000 surcharge. In addition to more severe sanctions, the bill mandated greater certainty of punishment. During committee hearings, the bill's proponents complained that some judges used their discretion to impose fines lower than those legally available and occasionally imposed no penalty at all. The measure's supporters lobbied success- fully to curtail such discretion, inserting into Samson's Law the principle that the newly established surcharges "shall be assessed" (rather than "may be assessed") for those convicted of, or pleading guilty to, illegally taking trophy animals. Boundaries Frequently focused on how class (Bourdieu 1984; Lamont 1992), racial and ethnic (Gans 1999), and gender (Epstein 1988) inequalities are created and maintained, the study of boundaries has illuminated such processes as differentiation, demarcation, and distinc- tion. But since boundaries can also be challenged, bridged, and reconfigured, Lamont and Moinar (2002:188) recommend that subsequent research be guided by a "simulta- neous concern for inclusion and exclusion." The Samson incident suggests that by drawing idealized moral contrasts between criminals and victims and by expressly aligning themselves with the latter while distancing themselves from the deviant, collectivities simultaneously tender inclusionary tokens (or symbolic bridges) to the assailed while broadcasting exclusionary signals (or symbolic barriers) toward the assail- ant (Douglas 1966). Moreover, serious infractions and the societal reactions they engen- der often spawn subsidiary bridges and barriers, some of which are likely to blunt the sharp, representational edges of the paramount opposition between perpetuators and injured parties and to temper its immanent structuring power (Alexander 1988b:188) for society and policy. In the Samson case, the primary contrast conception revolved around the shooter and the elk; secondary contrasts pitted hunters against poachers and good animals against bad ones. The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 371</page><page sequence="18">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Samson versus Francis In the crime's aftermath, Samson was depicted as an ideal victim while Francis, the man who shot him, was characterized as an ideal offender (Christie 1986). This opposition cast the bull as an incarnation of nature's inherent goodness and the offender as an emblem of evil, an enemy of nature and society, "an instigator of sacrilege" (Durkheim [1912] 1995:412). Through grieving, tributes, and ceremonies, the Valley conveyed a powerful bridging identification with the elk and the unsullied nature he symbolized. Through incessant invective, calls for severe punishment, and clamor to change the law, the same community proclaimed an exclusionary repudiation of the poacher and of the disregard for wildlife and the natural world his crime signified. Like Arluke's (2006:147-81) "beautiful" cruelty cases, the Samson incident involved an appealing animal, a bereaved community, and a "shadowy" transgressor. A widely circulated contrast conception paired the bull's veneration, discussed earlier, to the man's vilification, and fueled an unremittingly negative characterization of the poacher. Antipathy toward deviants is sometimes moderated when their derelictions are consid- ered either in conjunction with factors that partially mitigate the blameworthiness of their violations or in light of some honorific act or attribute that counterbalances, morally, their disrepute. The community, however, found little in Francis's behavior or background to curb condemnation. The details publicized about the shooting and the shooter foreclosed credible claims to the rationalizations - accident, impulse, hunger, ignorance of the law, or affiliation with a cultural or ethnic tradition that approves the practice - usually invoked to excuse or justify poaching (Eliason and Dodder 1999). In media accounts, town meetings, Web postings, and elsewhere, the man's motives were impugned: Francis killed Samson not for food or even sport, but out of sheer avarice - for the $10,000 the elk's rack would purportedly bring on the black market (Tardani 1995a:Al,A3). The crime betrayed Francis's glaring disregard for the safety of Y employ- ees and the approximately 1,000 guests on the grounds at the time of the shooting and his gross indifference for the stricken Samson, whom he deserted as security staff arrived on the scene. Further, Francis proved uncooperative and chronically disingenuous, skipping scheduled meetings with investigators and lying repeatedly to authorities about his role in the shooting. The attack on Samson, moreover, was not Francis's first wildlife offense: he was a suspect in three other poaching incidents, eventually being found guilty in two of these other cases. Nor was his prior offending restricted to wildlife: he had been convicted of theft, burglary, and receiving stolen property, and had served time in state prison. In addition to being a felon and an ex-con, Francis was an outsider, residing in the Denver-metro area with no ties to family or friends in the Valley. A more sympathetic sketch might have portrayed Francis's prior arrests and impris- onment as impediments to employment, suggesting that without legal means to support himself, he was pushed toward unlawful alternatives. But such a sketch was effectively pre-empted by reports revealing that, at the time of the shooting, Francis owned a house-siding business (Tardani 1995c:Al) and implying that a desire for easy money, not the absence of a job or steady income, motivated the crime. Francis was married with young children, and could have been described as a family man, an honorific status 372 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="19">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson that may have abated the animus. Yet press accounts intimated that even his family had grown disenchanted with Francis, his continuing malfeasance alienating his wife and bringing shame to his children (Tardani 1995d:Al,A3; Pankratz 1996:5C). The symbolic logic of ideal victims and ideal offenders, overlaid with the commu- nity^ attribution of natural virtue to Samson and the depiction of Francis as a moral and social outsider, prodded the Valley to bolster its boundaries through affirmation and negation, through inclusion and exclusion. By embracing Samson and the natural world he embodied, Estes identified itself as a place where respect for nature and wildlife is paramount. By renouncing Francis and abjuring the contempt for nature and wildlife reflected in his crime, Estes declared itself an anti-poaching community. Hunters versus Poachers Binary oppositions sometimes prove contagious, moving beyond the particular context in which they are initially crystallized into other domains. In the aftermath of the Samson shooting, such contagion might have spawned the condemnation (and exclu- sion) of other types of persons and practices as threats to the natural world as well as inclusionary demands for protecting additional forms of wildlife and nature. But the prospects for generalizing the contrast between Samson, a symbol of idyllic nature, and Francis, an emblematic despoiler of nature, in this way were effectively short-circuited by two other antinomies. The first drew a hard line between hunters and poachers. Genuinely outraged by the shooting, many sportsmen were also dismayed by the prospect that Francis would prove contaminating, that his disgrace would sully their moral standing (Douglas 1966). Distressed by this possibility, the virulent criticisms leveled at them over the years by some animal rights and environmental groups, and by what they perceived as the press's and public's uninformed conflation of hunting and poaching, outdoorsmen and their allies, including DOW, sharply separated themselves from poachers. They vehemently denounced Francis, with DOW officials assuring the public that the manner of Samson's slaying "was contrary to everything hunting stands for" (Asbury 1995a: 1). Postings by self-identified hunters on the Samson Web site decried the crime and its stigmatizing consequences: "As hunter, sportsman, and outdoorsman, I am outraged at this senseless tragedy. This person obviously does not have a clue about ethics, sportsmanship, or responsibil- ity. Because of one idiot, sportsmen are labeled again as slobs" (Baier 1996). No single group pressed for Samson's Law more aggressively than outdoorsmen, and in their remarks to the Colorado General Assembly, spokespersons for pro- hunting organizations (e.g., Colorado Bow Hunters Association, Colorado Outfitters Association, Colorado Wildlife Federation) joined their support for the statute to rev- erential, almost archetypical, characterizations of the hunter. They portrayed the latter as a person who rigorously adheres to both the formal rules and regulations set down by the DOW and the informal but vitally felt ethos of the hunting community. Sports- men personified the values of restraint, conservation, safety, concern for others in the field, and respect for law (also see Franklin 1999:119-21). They were bound to nature The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society 373</page><page sequence="20">Losing Samson Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield by primoridal-like ties (Jerolmack 2007), and their project was lauded for its positive contribution to wildlife management. Poachers, by contrast, embodied qualities every true hunter despised: They were selfish, greedy, and motivated either by the prospect of large, illegitimate profits or unseemly ego enhancement. Poachers were "criminals"8 who had no respect for legal authority or for sportsmen or their ethos. Unlike true outdoorsmen, poachers cared not at all for the animals they killed and were often satisfied with the rack alone, leaving the rest of the animal "to rot on a secluded hillside."9 If the principal opposition between Samson and Francis reaffirmed the Valley's respect for the natural world and wildlife and its rejection of poaching, the secondary dichotomy between legitimate sportsmen and poachers signaled that a community could revere nature and revile poaching while also honoring outdoorsmen and hunting. Good versus Bad Wildlife Articulated most clearly during legislative deliberations over Samson's Law, another antinomy approved the long-standing bifurcation between "good" and "bad" animals (Arluke and Sanders 1996:167-86; Lerner and Kalof 1999:578-9). Submitted to the General Assembly in 1997, the original Samson bill sought enhanced sanctions to shield all trophy-sized wildlife, including bears and mountain lions, from poaching. That proposal sparked vigorous objections from members of the House Committee on Agri- culture, Livestock, and Natural Resources, who, voicing concerns that resonated with the life conditions, traditions, and sensibilities of ranchers and farmers (Scarce 2005), pro- tested that bears and lions attacked livestock and, on rare occasions, threatened human life as well. Ranchers and farmers had the right, these lawmakers insisted, to protect their cattle and families from predators and should not be miscast as poachers for doing so. Deferring to these sentiments, the bill approved in 1998 deleted bears and mountain lions from the list of trophy-sized wildlife the statute sought to shield from poaching. If the opposition between Samson and Francis reaffirmed the Valley's respect for wildlife and the natural world and its renunciation of poaching, the subsidiary contrast between good and bad wildlife announced that a community could revere nature and revile poaching while also ratifying ranchers' and farmers' right to safeguard livestock and human life from "predatory" animals. CONCLUSION The findings of this exploratory study are consistent with the Durkheimian contention that the ostensibly inexorable march of disenchantment and rationalization does not preclude the possibility that symbolism, myth, affect, and ritual sometimes figure prominently in communal reactions to crime and deviance in contemporary societies. More specifically, we found that a cult of nature is a prominent element in the Estes Valley's collective identity, and that residents and visitors alike implicitly drew on this doctrine, and on the religion of humanity, respectively, to ecomorphize and anthro- pomorphize an elk. Ecomorphically, the Samson shooting was experienced, 374 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="21">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson collectively, as an indefensible attack on an embodied "natural other" and on the larger natural world and moral order he symbolized (Bell 1994:147). Anthropomorphically, it was experienced as an assault on a cherished friend and a charismatic celebrity. Many people were anguished and angered by Samson's slaying, and their shared sadness and outrage fueled piacular and expiatory gestures that reaffirmed the area's generalized regard for nature while defining the Valley as an adamantly anti-poaching community. Crime is not, however, only an occasion for revitalizing established sentiments or restoring an equilibrium temporarily disturbed by transgression. Some violations and the societal reactions they trigger portend that convention is giving way to something new (Durkheim [1895] 1982:101-4). Estes's response to the Samson shooting, consid- ered in conjunction with like-minded reactions to similar incidents in recent years in other American locales (e.g., Gibson 2009:61-7), may signal significant change in crimi- nalization (and deviance) and in prevailing conceptions of community. Every constellation of social sentiment deeply and widely held is associated with complementary configurations of crime and deviance. Just as collectivities that prize private property are primed to detect theft and those insisting on theological orthodoxy are inclined to uncover heresy (Erikson 1966:20-3), so social systems that revere the natural world are predisposed to discover conduct that despoils it. If the re-enchantment of nature (Gibson 2009) continues to blossom, the indissoluble link between a society's vision of the good and the forms of evil that it discerns and denounces (Alexander 2001) will likely spur a corresponding increase in the volume of acts and practices toward the natural world defined as criminal or deviant and a parallel rise in the intensity of sanctions, formal and informal, applied to these violations. A second possible transformation concerns what has been termed the terminal community (Geertz 1973), the most encompassing unity with which people feel inte- grated. Attuned to the territorial growth, structural differentiation, social and cultural heterogeneity, and soaring population of late 19th- and early 20th-century western Europe, Durkheim ([1898] 1973a) argued that societal boundaries were widening and that moral individualism, with its sacralization of the abstract humanity embodied in each and every person, represented the only creed that would enable these large, complex systems to cohere. This doctrine also provided grounds for Durkheim's ( [1898] 1973a, [1893] 1984:310-22) indictment of class, religious, and ethnic particularisms as inimical to modernity. Subsequent generations of humanitarians have amplified his critique, rebuking and dismantling other exclusionary beliefs and practices based on race, gender, nativity, sexual orientation and identity, age, and physical and cognitive abilities. Human beings have not been the only ones affected by this master trend of inclu- sion. Drawing on the elective affinity between humanitarianism and naturalism (e.g., Nibert 2002; Worster 2008:3-12, 465-6), reformers have extended the religion of humanity in ways Durkheim never imagined, pressing people to recognize the human- like qualities in nonhumans and the ethical obligations attendant upon that recognition (e.g., Kristof 2009).

Future naturalists are likely to pursue a threefold project aimed at clari- fying, defending, and extending their doctrine. Just as Durkheim ([1898] 1973a) clari- fied moral individualism by differentiating it from the utilitarian egoism with which it was often conflated, so naturalism's adherents will likely separate their creed from humanitarianism's large and sometimes suffocating shadow by pointing to the encumbrances and contradictions inhering in even the most well-intentioned anthro- pomorphisms (Mitchell, Thompson, and Miles 1997). At the same time, they are likely to draw on the natural sciences to clarify the intricate but often unseen and not widely understood webs of interdependence that connect life forms and an animate earth (Harding 2006). The proposition that nature and other animals are sacrosanct, like the idea that every person "partakes of the transcendent majesty that churches of all time lend to their gods" (Durkheim [1898] 1973a:46), will continue to be tested in the real world of struggle (Herda-Rapp and Goedeke 2005). This notion's adversaries are not only shadowy animal abusers (Arluke 2004, 2006) and poachers (Reisner 1991), but conventional, and seemingly innocuous, individual practices as well as entire industries ( Jorgenson 2008; Gibson 2009: 146-67, 192-217) that, in the aggregate, wreak havoc on the natural world and its nonhuman inhabitants. If naturalism is to retain its moral authority, it will vigorously engage these (and other) opponents (Gibson 2009:221-54). Naturalists are likely to extend their creed well beyond ecomorphic constructions of charismatic species. They are also likely to deconstruct discourses that divide nature and culture (Sabloff 2001), critique theologies that marginalize and subordinate the nonhu- man, deride rigid demarcations between good and bad animals, spotlight contradictions enervating purportedly "pro-environmental" messages (King 1994), and challenge imagined geographies' prevailing orthodoxies about place, animals, and the natural world (Wolch and Emel 1998; Philo and Wilbert 2000). In addition, they are likely to assail the reigning, human-centered conception of community as reductionistic and exclusionary, and propose replacing it with a more inclusive, ecologically informed vision of the terminal community. That alternative is likely to contest humanitarianism's cardinal conceit - that the human being is "the god" (Durkheim [1898] 1973a:46) - and reenvision people as but one vital part of the larger "fabric of life by which one creature is linked with another, and each with its surroundings" (Carson [1955] 1998:2). Finally, since community, of whatever scope, must be felt and enacted (Rawls 1997) as well as thought, naturalists are likely to fashion and refashion rhetorics (illuminated by science and inspired by religion and art), employ an array of media, and devise a variety of nature-engaging activities to foment a keenly felt sense of identification and solidarity with nature and animals. These rhetorics, media, and modes of participation are likely to affirm people's membership in an encompassing natural world, celebrate the ineffable joys of communing with nature and with the nonhuman, and stress humans' obligation to act as responsible stewards on behalf of that world and those others and, ultimately, on our own. 376 The Sociological Quarterly 51 (2010) 355-383 © 2010 Midwest Sociological Society</page><page sequence="23">Paul Colomy and Robert Granfield Losing Samson ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Arnold Arluke, Kurt Fausch, Leslie Irvine, Michael Monahan, and James Pickering for their insights and encouragement. We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and editors of The Sociological Quarterly for their many helpful comments and suggestions. We also thank Lindsay Redd for her meticulous transcription of the audio- recorded data. This research was supported by a Faculty Senate Research Grant from the University of Denver. NOTES 'The principal objections dispute what critics regard as Durkheim's inaccurate evolutionary account of law; his overly consensual depiction of society; his naïveté about state power and other forms of domination; and his inattentiveness to enduring inequalities and their enervating effects on a variety of institutions, including systems of justice. 2We draw selectively on Weber to clarify our revisions to the Durkheimian approach to crime, punishment, law, and boundaries, while recognizing that these theorists advance disparate con- ceptions of modernity. Weber saw the modern world as disenchanted, and while claiming that modern men and women, much like the ancient Greeks and Romans, pledge fealty to many different and often rival gods, he depicted the objects of modern worship - the value spheres of distinct institutional domains - in secular terms. Durkheim, on the other hand, highlighted the religious dimensions of all social orders, even the most modern. 3These archival data are analyzed in greater depth in Granfield and Colomy (2005). 4No individual we interviewed, media account, or any other data available to us identified the original source of Samson's name. Every person with whom we spoke, however, believed that the name aptly captured the elk's uncommon size, strength, and nobility. 5Arnold Arluke mentioned the term ecomorphization to one of the authors in a personal commu- nication (November 15, 2002). distancing the tribute from even the appearance of an unseemly interest in exploiting tragedy for profit, the ad noted that "All proceeds from sales will be contributed to the Colorado Division of Wildlife's Operation Game Thief [a special program to apprehend and prosecute poachers] and to Animal Rescue [a special fund for treatment of injured birds of prey]." 7The phrase is Garland's (1990:61). 8Remark delivered during hearings of the Colorado House Committee on Agriculture, Livestock, and Natural Resources.
