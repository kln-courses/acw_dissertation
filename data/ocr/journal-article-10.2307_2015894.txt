<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy aind the Concepts of Modern Science. OLIVER L. REISER. New York: The Macmillan Company. 1935. xvii + 323 pp. $3.50. There are two kinds of books on the philosophy of science: the kind which analyzes the concepts of science in terms of their opera- tional significance within the context of scientific inquiry; and the kind which employs the conclusions of the sciences for ulterior pur- poses-to construct a cosmology, to preach a moral, or to justify the ways of God or the universe to man. On the whole, Professor Reiser's book falls within the second division, and it has the charac- teristic merits and defects of such undertakings-imaginative bold- ness coupled with an uncritical use of fundamental concepts. The book is difficult to summarize. It marshals much detailed factual information as data for a synthetic view of nature, and pleads for a naturalism which assigns an integral place for qualities and novelties and which recognizes the organic unity of the universe. The first of the two parts of the book is concerned with the physical sciences. Mr. Reiser tries to find in a modified emergent evolution- ism (which he regards as not dissimilar to dialectic materialism) a mediating alternative to mechanistic materialism and idealism. He argues for a revival of anthropomorphism and he exhibits alleged instances of its pervasiveness in theoretical physics. The argument is familiar: "crude materialism" is first refuted; and then, in agree- ment with the common procedure of emergent evolutionist, a basis is sought in all phases of nature for emergents at higher levels. The result is that "something analogous to mind and purpose" is read back into the realm of "physical reality." Mr. Reiser examines the crisis in contemporary science and logic, and discovers that the integrity of the former is threatened by a lack</page><page sequence="2">OTHER NEW BOOKS AND JOURNALS 587 of coherent first principles, while the validity of the principles of the latter seem to be denied by the recent conclusions of atomic phys- ics. A key to these puzzles is found in the facts of light, and Mr. Reiser tries to show how the problems of the interaction of force and matter, of soul and body may be resolved by noting and "generaliz- ing" the traits of vision. Light is the link between logic and physics, atomism and continuity, mind and brain, the physical and spiritual. There is thus a fundamental kinship between light and "life." Indeed, light is God, so that the outcome of Mr. Reiser's reflections on modern science is a "generalized" sun worship. The second part of the book is concerned with the social sciences. In it is traced the emergence of social patterns out of the larger physical background. Mr. Reiser views human history as the field for the operation of a "generalized" second law of thermodynamics, whereby the latter acquires a spiritual significance. The final note of the book is a plea for a "creative morality"-the religion of humanism. The volume doubtless is the transcription of a vision concerning which Mr. Reiser feels keenly. However, most of it remains unin- telligible to one who hasn't shared it; what is meant by "life" taken substantially, or by "mind" conceived as an extra dimension of space, for example, is fatally obscure. Perhaps Mr. Reiser will some day articulate and support by cogent arguments what it is he really sees. E. N.</page></plain_text>
