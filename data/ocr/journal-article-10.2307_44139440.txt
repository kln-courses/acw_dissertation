<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYNCRETISTIC CULT IN CAMBODIA Pranabananda Jash Following Brahmanical settlement in the South-East Asian countries, Hinduism occupied a prime position in the domain of the religious structure. Of the two popular neo-Brahmanical sects, viz., the Saivas and the Vaisnavas, that flourished in Cambodia, Saivism was by far more influential and it exercised a profound influence on the whole course of religious development. Siva was represented both as a human figure as well as in his Unga form, but the latter occurs more frequently, as in India. Of the two sub-divisions of the anthropomorphic Saiva icons-one of mild disposition ( saumya ) and the other of fierce disposition ( raudra ). the syncretistic cult belongs to the former one.1 As a human figure Siva is represented in a variety of forms, such as Harihara, Ardhanarisvara, Martanda- bhairava, Siva-Buddha, etc. In fact, the entire Hindu pantheon of Pauranic deities was known in South East Asia. An attempt has been made in the following pages to throw light on the syncretic cults-especially on Harihara as reflected in the epigraphs. The combination of Hari ( Visnu ) and Hara (Siva) in one image forms the theme of this icon.1 Needless to say, the conception was borrowed from India. The earliest literary reference to Harihara sub- sect is to be found probably in the Harivamsa. In the Epic and the Puranic accounts we find that each divine personality has a tendency to blend or merge with the other. The Puranas relate many episodes of how the two gods, Hari and Hara, became one and the same.1 In the Cambodian literature4 we have several descriptions of this combined cult. In fact, nowhere is this syncretism more enduringly effected and poignantly expressed than in the Cambodian Ramayana, known as Ramakertił ,s The growing spirit of harmony between these two Hindu sects found expression not only in the literary accounts but also in the epigraphy and sculpture from the early South- East Asian countries. The inscriptions hailing from different parts of the Cambodian territory</page><page sequence="2">$25 and dating from the early medieval period constantly sing the praises of the compound deity Siva-Visnu, known under such names as Hari- hara* Sambhu-Visnu,7 Sankara-Narayana,8 Hara-Acyuta,* Hari-lsvaraM etc Thus, the undated inscription" from Ang Pu (Vat Pu) during the time of Isanavarman records the erection of an image and a linga of Siva-Visnu by the ascetic isanadatta. The invocation runs thus : "Victorious are Hara and Acyuta, who have become one for the good of the world, though as the spouses of Parvati and Sri they are two distinct powers. Victorious also is isanavarman, famed especially for his heroism, who supports the earth like seva-naga The Muni isanadatta, celebrated for his austerities, his life devoted to poverty and study, and the off-spring of an illustrious family, has consecrated this image, in which the bodies of Siva and Acyuta are joined together half and half, for the welfare of his parents. He has also consecrated a linga of Visnu and of Isana Candesvara-his deci- sion being that their (of the two deities) worship should be combined by participation in the same offering", Another inscription of isanavarman of the Saka year 549 (=627 A.D.) discovered from the Vat Chakret Temple12 records the installa- tion of an image of Siva-Visnu ( Hari-Sankara , verse-5) by the vassal chief of Tamra-Pura, The combined deity was also known by the name of Sankara-Narayana. In fact, this particular epithet seems to have been very popular in Kambuja as there are many inscriptions referring to this name. The Phnom Dei temple inscription18 of Yasovarman dated saka year 815, contains two Sanskrit slokas and eight lines in Khmer. The Sanskrit portion of the record furnishes us with the fact that king Yasovarman fixed the limits of the domains of the temple dedicated to Hara and Acyuta, united in one body (HariharaJ, which was built on the mountain called Purandara (i.e., the Phnom Dei). Here we come across epithets like Harisvara, Sri- Haracyuta* Besides inscriptions, some of the oldest and finest Khmer sculptures represent this combination of the deity. A.K. Coomara- swamy has noticed some of these sculptural representations of the pre-Khmer Brahmanical period. "An almost equally impressive example of the pre-Khmer Brahmanical art is presented in the Hari- hara of Prasat Andet, Kompon Thorn (fig. 333) now in the Musse</page><page sequence="3">926 Sorrault at Phom Pen. Here the ornament is restricted to the narrow jewelled gridle; but the ears are pierced for the reception of earrings, a feature characteristic of Paliava art of the same period in India Another figure of Harihara, from Phnom Da, now in the Musee Guimet, is of similar type. Both figures may be dated early in the seventh century."14 In some cases these two deities were combined in a linga emblem. The Prasat Komphus inscription of Jayavarman V, dated Saka year 892/94, records the religious foundations of the Brahmana Divakarabhatta, viz., a Visnu-Mahesvara lingai In fact, this type of icon was unusual in Indian sculpture, although some stray specimens are not unknown, One Unga of this type can be found in the temple of Harihara Chatrapure, a remote village near the Sonpur railway station in Bihar." It has some interesting features. On a linga Hari and Hara are represented side by side and not merged in one form as we find in other icons. This shows, that (i) the deities here are maintaining their separate entities and the Harihara sub-sect was of a slightly different type and (ii) the Unga here cannot be regarded as a phallic emblem, but merely a black-red slab for cartying the image of the two deities. In fact, whatever might have been its earlier character, the linga was no more a phallus in the later days, as proved by the mukha-lingam of India and South-east Asia.1' The linga was the god himself ( Ungarn saksad Mahesvaram ). The outward expression of this syncretic image of different deities evidently indicates their oneness. That there is no distinction bet- ween Siva and Visnu is best illustrated by the epic conception of Visnu in the form of Siva Siva in the form of Visnu.'18 The episodes also narrate how the gods-Hari and Hara -are the same, though two in outward appearance. It is stated in a Purana that "as water mingles with water so Visnu in his composite form becomes of the same aspect as Rudra The one transcendent being has differ- entiated himself in the form of the two gods. There is no Siva without Visnu and no Visnu without Sankara, and, therefore, Rudra and Visnu assume a composite form as Harihara."19 The eclectic attitude of the Hindu religious sects is also mani- fested by the representation of Ardhanarisvara, Sivaditya, Siva-</page><page sequence="4">927 Buddha, etc.. The idea of the Ardhanarlsvara form of Siva consisting of one half Siva and the other half Parvati or Sakti was also prevalent in these regions.40 Even cases of other composite images, viz., Sivaditya and Siva-Buddha, are not unknown. The Sivaditya cult which still exists in this country is nothing but a combination of Saivism and the worship of the Aditya (i e„ the Sun god). This combined form of Siva and Surya was known to India as Martanda- Bhairava." The combination of Saivism with the cult of Buddha is un- doubtedly an important factor in the development of religious history of South- East Asia. In India we have no such distinct evidence showing the association of Saivism with Buddhism.22 It is purely a contribution of the religious teachers of South-east Asian countries. The syncretism of Saivism and Buddhism was to be found in Campa, Kambuja, in Java under the Singasari and the Majapahit dynasties. According to D.G.E. Hall, "In religion the symbiosis of Saivism and Buddhism has become a mirage; and although outwardly in the sculptures their Hindu or Buddhist characters are distinguishable, their real significance must be sought in native folklore and legend. They personify the divine and magic powers worshipped by the people. When king Visnu-vadhana (1248-68) died his ashes divided between two shrines. At Chandi M Ieri he was worshipped as an incarnation of Siva, while at Chandi Djago as the Bodhisattva."M Amoghapasa the next king of the Sangasari was Kertanagara (1268 A D.) who completed the process of religious unification by practising the cult of Siva-Buddha. Even in modern theology of these countries Buddha is regarded as the younger brother of Siva, and there is a close affinity between these two doctrines. Even Siva, Visnu and Buddha were all regarded as identical and so were their Saktis. Thus the Siva-Buddha cult was an Indian cloak sheltering a native cult of great antiquity and power.14 On the basis of the above discussion it may be said that the spread of Indian culture abroad did not result in the suppression of the indigenous style of life, on the other hand it led to its transformation into new patterns.25 The composite cult which spread to South-east Asia from the Indian sub-continent has be«n given a new orientation by the people of Cambodia.</page><page sequence="5">928 REFERENCES J, P.
