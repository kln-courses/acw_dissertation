The principle of a loosely chronological order was demonstrated in the decision to devote the first rooms to Africa and the final ones to Oceania, reflecting the shifting taste for the art of the two continents among Western artists and collectors. The result was a series of high-impact tableaux vivants in which modern and 'prim- itive' pieces stood next to each other in perceptive contrasts, without necessarily interacting but nevertheless recreating the sense of surprise produced by avant-garde art and non-European objects. This was the case, for instance, with the odd coupling of two Korewori crocodiles from Papua New Guinea and Monet's Nymphéas triptych of 1917-21 (Fig.71). Presented suggestively as if they floated beneath the surface of Monet's pond, the elaborately carved crocodiles also emphasised the decorative roughness of the painting's surface. The exhibition reversed the ratio of modern Western and 'primitive' works in the Beyeler collection in order to convey the visual impact of both in the spirit of its founder, Ernst Beyel- er, who had initially intended to assemble a comprehensive collection of non-European art, but narrowed this to a careful selection of African (nine) and Oceanic (sixteen) objects to juxtapose with his Cubist and Surrealist holdings.2 The date at which Beyeler began to collect African and Oceanic works, we are told, 'remains unclear', although acquisitions were increased in the wake of William Rubin's 1984 exhibition (Primitivismy in 20th Century Art at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.3 It was in relation to Rubin's hugely controversial show that some of the complexities beyond the curatorial plot of Visual Encounters emerged. Rubin's gargantuan exhibition was indeed epoch-making, the first major show to bring 'primitive' art centre stage in the development of Modernism, and tne first to stir a dialogue between art history and anthropology within the context of post-structuralist thought. Nonetheless, that exhibition has become an example of how not to display 'primitive' art. The problem lay in Rubin's initial aim - legit- imate from the point of art history, and original at the time - to establish which specific 'primitive' sculptures inspired the artists who collected them at the beginning of the twentieth century. Made impossible by the dispersal of collections, the exhibition reverted to the creation of a story of modern art's encounter with non-European works, revolving around the putative existence of 'natural' affinities between the two. The MoMA narrative, condemned by anthro- pologists and postmodernist art historians alike for silencing the voice of 'the other', aimed at an all-encompassing, progressive and celebratory history of modern art through its relationship with other cultures, felt as equal- ly self-created and expressive. The essentialist claims laid by the 'Prim- itivism' exhibition resounded disturbingly at a time when, following the impact of Edward Said's Orientalism (1978), art history and crit- icism began to integrate post-colonial theory. Yet, whether formalist or 'spiritual', a univer- sally transcendental attitude to modern and 'primitive' art was already part and parcel of the attitude of modern artists and collectors. Seventy years before MoMA's exhibition, the first ever American show of 'primitive' art, Statuary in Wood by African Savages. The Root of Modern Art (19 14), had already pre- sented in New York the African and 'clas- sical' modern art collections of the Parisian dealer Paul Guillaume. Taking place in the gallery of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, and with theoretical and performative contri- butions by the Dadaist Marius de Zayas, and the composer Alberto Savinio, this exhibition reminds us that, far from being Rubin's invention, the concept of affinity between 'primitive' and modern art reflects earlier concerns to establish a genealogy of the avant-garde from 'primal' cultures, thus bypassing modern Western tradition. It is clear that our impression of African and Oceanic art has been formed by this philyoge- netic narrative of modern art. As Nélia Dias has written, 'an increasing stress on the inter- nal qualities of the work of art also changed the status of extra-European objects from ethno- graphic documents to carriers of universal aesthetic meanings'.4 At times one wished that 71.

Beyeler Foundation, Basel). the Basel exhibition and its catalogue had reminded the visitor of this particular position. Rather, a distance was kept between the fields of art and anthropology, the first displayed throughout the exhibition, the latter being the unique subject of an 'interactive' catalogue in which a series of academic essays by ethnolo- gists and anthropologists discuss the social function of the African and Oceanic works on display. The catalogue's introductory section presents, however, an open-ended dialogue between the Beyeler curator, art historians and anthropologists, in which Gottfried Boehm stresses the importance of inquiry 'into the preconditions that led people like Ernst Beyel- er to interest themselves in this art . . Λ5 By staging the story of modern artists' flirta- tion with 'primitive' sculpture in the simple but all-the-more gripping terms of a coup-de- foudre we were constantly, though indirectly, reminded that the romantic story between 'primitive' and modern art is a one-sided affair. Nowhere was this more evident than in the juxtaposition of Mondrian's Picture no. Ill (1938) and three Malagan carvings from Papua New Guinea (nineteenth/twentieth century), the first rigorous and minimalist, the latter Baroque in effect, yet remaining a striking complementary group whose decorative impact was accentuated by the display (Fig. 72). Although the history of primitivism staged at the Beyeler was more in the spirit of bal en masque than Indiana Jones, some of the unex- pected visual and metaphorical juxtapositions succeeded in producing new perceptions of the modern works on display with the poten- tial of constructing a less normative history of modern art. Menacing nkisi ('nail fetishes') from the Congo transformed Braque's and Picasso's analytic Cubism from post-Kantian to pre-Bataillan; Le Douanier Rousseau's jungles finally found a truly primitivist dimen- sion within an anthropomorphic forest of tino aitu Nukuoro figures; and a Hawaiian feather portrait of an angry war god screamed out the tension found in Rothko's monochromes. Visual Encounters is to be praised for its effort to take into account the different dimensions of the primitivist debate while celebrating the sense of beauty through which we have come to appreciate the works on display. 1 Catalogue: Visual Encounters.
