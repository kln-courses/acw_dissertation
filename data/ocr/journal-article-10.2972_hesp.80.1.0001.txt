Work conducted in 2005 and 2006 completed  the exploration of Late Archaic levels within the Communal Dining Building  (putative andreion complex), the Monumental Civic Building, and the adjacent  Service Building. These contexts and their assemblages, especially the animal  and plant remains, permit the characterization of diverse dining practices and  the interpretation of patterns of food production and consumption. Both  the Communal Dining Building and the Monumental Civic Building show  extensive evidence of communal feasting and the integration of cult. INTRODUCTION Excavations have been conducted since 2002 at the site of Azoria, southeast  of the village of Kavousi in northeastern Crete. Work has recovered public  buildings of Archaic date, clustered near the peak on the west and south  sides of the South Acropolis and covering a total area of over 0.60 ha  (Fig. 1). Each building produced evidence of destruction and abandonment  1. Haggis et al. 2004, pp. 390–393;  2007a, pp. 243, 301–305; 2007b,  in the early 5th century b.c.

There is no  stratigraphic evidence of linear or concentric growth of structures over  time. Building forms remain fixed from the time of their construction  until abandonment, and though there is evidence of room modifications  and some buildup of occupation surfaces, the clay and bedrock floors were  evidently reused continuously throughout the life of the settlement until  the early 5th century.5 The Archaic rebuilding of the site expanded the settlement to its max-  imum size (ca. 15 ha) and created a zone of public buildings on the upper west  slope of the South Acropolis (Figs. 1, 2). We use the term “public” to describe  generally suprahousehold communal spaces accommodating a variety of  possible activities and configurations of groups. It is important to remember,  however, that activities will have varied in their degree of inclusivity, and  4.

State plan of   what can be called civic architecture. Although we lack historical documen- the Communal Dining Building.   tation of Azoria’s “civic” identity—namely, an inscription identifying the R. D. Fitzsimons city—we think that evidence of new building practices, the reorganization  of communal and domestic space, and changes in the agropastoral economy  and suprahousehold activities are material reflections of social configurations  in keeping with a civic status and an urban environment.7 The public buildings are the Communal Dining Building (putative  andreion) on the upper west slope; the Monumental Civic Building and  the Service Building on the southwest slope; and the Cult Building on  the south (Figs. 1, 2). The Cult Building, which we presented in detail  in an earlier report, is poorly preserved.8 As a result of the shallowness of  deposition, later Hellenistic (late 3rd–2nd century b.c.) activity in the area,  and recent deep plowing on the south slope of the South Acropolis, the  building’s foundation and floor surfaces have been severely damaged. Given  the size and features of the building, however, and its location in a wide and  level area near the main access to the hilltop, on the edge of a major street  running north–south on the east side of the South Acropolis, we think  that the structure may have served as the settlement’s main temple. The  three other structures—the Communal Dining Building, the Monumental  Civic Building, and the associated Service Building—have been the focus  of ongoing excavation. In 2005 and 2006 we completed work in these areas,  augmenting considerably our information on their functions and the role  of civic architecture in the Archaic city. THE COMMUNAL DINING BUILDING  In our earlier reports, we referred to the Communal Dining Building as the  “putative andreion” or “andreion complex.” We tentatively proposed using  the term andreion as a compelling historical analogy that offered a con-  ceptual framework for the interpretation of assemblages that suggest the  functions of a communal dining hall in an Archaic Cretan urban context  (Figs. 1, 3).9 The term suggested attributes and activities that find material  correlates in the Communal Dining Building at Azoria: the suprahousehold  centralized mobilization, storage, and processing of food and drink; the  performance of sacrifices as part of feasting behavior; the display, storage,  or use of armor; and the organization of segmented, if not segregated,  communal dining and structured symposia.10 6.

Our use of this term has been challenged, mainly on the grounds that  our identification of the structure as an andreion was based on inferences  about the building’s function and not on epigraphic evidence.11 Indeed,  the archaeological identification of andreia is a vexing issue: uncertainty  about the correspondence between structure and function is compounded  by uncertainty about how andreia operated in Archaic Crete.12 Although  we know that andreia were physical places, indeed actual buildings, in some  Archaic Cretan cities,13 too few post-7th-century contexts on the island  have been sufficiently or properly explored to allow us to begin to define  such spaces archaeologically or epigraphically.14 Nevertheless, contexts of  8th- and 7th-century date, such as the early hearth temples at Dreros and  Prinias, have commonly been referred to as andreia, leading to a lively, if  historically problematic, discussion of the nature of early Cretan political  organization and its relationship to contexts of public commensality  and ritualized dining.15 The term itself has become something of a  historiographic artifact, applied widely—though not indiscriminately—to  Bronze Age, Early Iron Age, Archaic, and Hellenistic contexts.  Thus we recognize that using the term andreion as a model or historical  analogy for the interpretation of archaeological contexts is potentially  reductive, because it may codify the attribution and cloud the complex  regional, historical, and cultural implications of both historically attested  institutions and the archaeological remains. Because andreion suggests  aspects of local, regional, or ethnic societal structures that may elude the  middle-range interpretive frameworks normally derived from archaeology,  we find it preferable to use a term that alludes to the functional components  of the building and to the material patterns recovered in this archaeological  context.16 Consequently, we have chosen to refer to the putative andreion  as the Communal Dining Building. Our purpose here is to present work  conducted in 2005 and 2006 in rooms A1900N and A1900S, summarize  the various components of the building exposed to date, and develop  inferences on the structuring of groups around distinctive patterns of  communal drinking and dining.  11.

On the lower  level a series of three storerooms (A1200, A1400, and A1500)17 were con-  nected directly to the main kitchen (A1600), which was equipped with a  large, flat embedded quern in the southeast corner, and a variety of cooking,  serving, and dining implements, including a krater stand fragment, hydrias,  jugs, cups, skyphoi, large lamps, chytrai, a transport amphora, and a pithos.18  Other finds in A1600 included a bronze pin, ring, and shield boss, as well  as an imported Thasian skyphos and an Attic lekythos. Plant remains from  the two preserved adjacent storerooms suggest the careful organization  and segregation of foodstuffs. Wine must with lees (including pips, skins,  and stems) as well as olives were stored in the pithoi in A1200, and cereal  grains and pulses in A1500.19  South of this main kitchen (A1600) are two smaller kitchens (A600N  and A600S) aligned with the contour. The access to the smaller kitchens  may have been through a corridor or courtyard leading directly south from  A1600, or from a street along the west side of the building, but extreme  erosion on the western edge of the terrace confounds reconstruction. It  is likely that other rooms of the complex extended out to the west along  the contour, conceivably doubling the size of the building (and of the  rooms for dining) as preserved today. While the northernmost of the two  small kitchens (A600N) had largely been cleaned of its contents, save  for a small saddle quern and traces of grape, olive, wheat, pulse, fig, and  poppy embedded in the floor surface, the southernmost room (A600S)  was apparently abandoned and used as a dump in its last phase, collecting  a considerable amount of discarded food debris that may well have been  derived from adjacent dining rooms on the upper terrace. The bulk of the  food debris consisted of animal bones (dressed cuts of meat) and marine  shells, but there were also grape pips, olive pits, and almond shells, a range  of foods consistent with those of the storerooms and active kitchens.20 The upper terrace is accessible from the kitchens via a wide stairway  and porch that opens onto a vestibule (A1900S) that served to mediate  access to a large dining hall on the south (A2000) and two other rooms  on the north (A1900N and A800); another long room of slightly larger  dimensions was partially excavated immediately west and along the side  of A2000, but on a lower level (Fig. 3). The largest of the northern rooms,  A800, contained several large terracotta krater stands, while the southern  17.

Fitzsimons </page> <page sequence="9"> the  archaic  c iv ic  bu ild ings  at  azor ia 9 bordered by a wide stone-lined drain along the north side, and on the south,  by the entrance to the dining room (A2000). It is entered through a porch  and double doors at the top of a stairway on the west. The surviving steps  and postholes for the overhang of the porch were first discovered in 2004,  but excavation in 2005 exposed the upper two rows of risers, running along  the full width of the porch, and gave greater definition to the architecture  of the doorway, which included a stone-built pier marking the transition  into the vestibule (Fig. 4: A1920). This pier supported the clay roof of the  vestibule on the west and what we reconstruct as an overhang, probably of  wood, extending out over the steps of the porch.  The pier separated two large wooden doors, whose pivots were found  inside the upper set of risers: the pivot for the southern door is situated in  front (west) of the pier, and the one for the northern door is just south of the  mouth of the drain (Fig. 4). Their position indicates that each door would  have been almost 1.5 m wide from pivot to doorjamb. This double-door  arrangement, so far unparalleled on the site, is interesting in its unusual  width, structural complexity, and formal elaboration. The doorway gave  access to the vestibule and from there to rooms on the north and south.  Given the upward slope of the floor of the vestibule from west to east, the  doors opened outward to the west and away from the pier. The floor of the vestibule was constructed of hard-packed clay on  shaved bedrock. Although the surface was found to be worn and eroded on  the east, the western portion was well preserved and littered with food and  broken pottery, presumably swept from adjacent rooms (A800, A1900N,  and A2000; Figs. 3, 4). Some material had evidently slid down the sloping  floor of the vestibule into the porch area on both sides of the pier and over  the top row of steps on the porch. The condition of the animal bones, marine  shells, and seeds suggests discarded dining debris, similar to the contents  of the dump in the south kitchen of A600.22 The area of the vestibule  (A1900S) produced significant quantities of sheep, goat, and pig bone  fragments, including both upper and lower limb elements. A number of  scapula, humerus, innominate, and femur fragments represent high meat- value elements. Several samples exhibit cut or chop marks indicating the  reduction of limb elements into pieces of meat.  In addition, marine shells were relatively plentiful in this context. The  main deposit near the doorway produced 147 complete limpet shells (Patella  sp.) and 27 top shells (Monodonta), as well as numerous shell fragments.  The abundant marine shells and fish and sea urchin remains, together with  high meat-value elements of sheep, goat, and pig, constitute an assemblage  consistent with feasting debris found elsewhere in the building, including  the substantial food dump in the abandoned kitchen to the west (A600S).  Indeed, it is likely that the material in A1900S resulted from the periodic  cleaning of the rooms of the upper terrace. The food debris was probably  swept into the porch and drain from adjacent rooms, shoveled out onto  the street in front of the porch, and ultimately gathered and deposited in  the kitchen A600S, which had evidently fallen into disuse, becoming a  22.

A1900N (Fig. 4), whose floor level is about 1 m higher than that of the  western end of the vestibule. While the slope at this juncture is extremely  eroded—only the beddings of steps are preserved—a well-fashioned riser of  schist on the second step gives us an idea of how the original stairway might  have looked. Excavation in the eastern room of A1900N removed a deep  layer of wall collapse and roofing material, exposing a well-preserved floor  surface, a schist post support in the center of the room, and an elongated  stone-built bench, initially uncovered in 2004, that we are calling a ground  altar (Figs. 4, 5). The east side of the room could not be fully explored  because of the precarious position of the collapsed east wall; it was necessary  to maintain a stepped scarp to retain the tipped wall. On the west side of the  room, just west of the doorway into A800, are the remains of a north–south  spur wall (A1916); a cut-bedrock threshold indicates access to a room on  the eroded western edge of the terrace (Fig. 4). This western wall continues  southward where it extends over a cut-bedrock bedding and then corners  (A1923), forming the north wall of the vestibule and drain (A1919). In this  poorly preserved western room in A1900N, we found traces of the floor  surface only in the northeast corner (formed by walls A1916 and A812);  elsewhere excavation exposed the gravel floor packing and cobble fill of  the spine wall, eroding out of the sloping terrace. The only indications of  the function of this space are flat sideropetra stones, possibly pithos stands.  While no pithos was found in the western room, the base of a pithos was  found in the northwest corner of the east room of A1900N, in front of the  doorway into A800 (Fig. 4). A flotation sample from this floor packing  produced traces of grain, pulse, olive, and grape, raising the possibility that  this room was used for small-scale agricultural storage. The floor of the preserved eastern room of A1900N (Fig. 4) was made  of phyllite clay that had been layered in efforts to level off the bedrock,  which now slopes sharply from northeast to southwest. The presence  of the schist-slab post support and a deep layer of ceiling clay indicates  that the space was originally roofed. On the east side of the room is the  long benchlike installation noted above, whose form and associated finds  indicate that it functioned as a ground altar (Fig. 5). It is a single oblong  structure, 2.30 m in length, consisting of three one-course high platforms  built of sideropetra and dolomite fieldstones. In spite of the irregular sloping  terrain and erosion within the room, it is clear that the irregular blocks  were originally fitted to shape three level and neatly rectangular platforms,  each separated from the other by a divider or header stone that projected  about 10 cm above the top surface of the adjacent platforms (Fig. 5). The  northern and middle platforms each measure ca. 0.80 x 0.60 m (Figs. 4, 5).  The southern platform is shorter, but only because of poor preservation; the  end was badly damaged during the collapse of the megalithic east wall of  the building, and the stones have shifted out of position because of erosion.  The bench is built on a rise in the bedrock and a bedding of clay that elevate  it slightly above the surrounding floor (Fig. 5). Excavation down to floor  level on either side of the installation in 2006 produced concentrations of  burned animal and plant remains. In 2004 we had reached a level of occupation debris on the east side of  the bench, where the bedrock rises in the northeast corner of the room. Here  </page> <page sequence="11"> the  archaic  c iv ic  bu ild ings  at  azor ia 11 Figure 5. A1900N: ground altar,  from the west. Photo D. C. Haggis we found considerable amounts of carbonized plant material, including  olive, grape, fig, pistachio, and poppy, as well as grains and pulses.23 In 2006  we exposed the floor surfaces on both the east and west sides (Fig. 4), finding  deposits of powdery white and gray ash, and fragmentary unburned, burned,  and calcined animal bones and burned seeds. The largest concentration  of ash was found along the east side, and there were additional pockets of  burned bone and ash immediately west of the northern end. Furthermore,  the exposed rise in the dolomite bedrock floor bordering the east side was  fractured and showed evidence of burning, suggesting repeated exposure  to heat. While no burned debris was found directly on top of the bench,  the proximity of the ash and bone on both sides (and its absence across the  central area of the room) suggests that the material had been swept from  the installation itself during periods of cleaning. Some burned material had  evidently spilled onto the floor on the west side, but it appears as if most of  the debris had been repeatedly collected and perhaps heaped or contained  on the east side, that is, out of the path of foot traffic and activity in the  central area of the room. The carbonized plant remains from around the platforms produced the  most varied assemblage of any room in the Communal Dining Building.  Seeds identified thus far include olive, grape, almond, wheat, broad bean,  vetch, fig, poppy, and possibly pistachio. The olive remains include entire  pits and large fragments of pits derived from whole fruits. Small quantities  of skins and stems along with larger quantities of grape pips suggest wine  must with inclusion of lees. The ash deposit from the west side of the platform (Fig. 6: A1931.4)  contained a number of unburned pig bones, including first and second  cervical vertebrae and maxilla segments, as well as a scapula segment with  chop marks and a distal humerus, both indicative of food debris. There are  also several unidentifiable bone fragments, three of which were completely  burned. The heavy residue fraction from a flotation sample produced tiny  unidentifiable burned and unburned animal bone fragments, including one  23.

Papanikolopoulos through the scapular neck and another through the scapular blade, indicat-  ing the reduction of a large meat segment (shoulder) into smaller portions.  Moreover, a sheep or goat scapula had a chop mark on the medial face, also  probably resulting from the reduction of a meat portion. Samples derived  from the quarter-inch screen and flotation produced numerous burned,  partially burned, and heated (browned/partially blackened) bones, including  a number of heavily burned and whitened fragments (Fig. 6). Among the  latter are long bone diaphysis and cancellous tissue fragments, as well as  sheep/goat cranial, tarsal, and innominate fragments. It is likely that these  fragmentary and heavily burned pieces of bone represent sacrificial debris  swept off the platform along with the ash. Given the form of the structure and its associated remains, the bench  in A1900N is thus most likely to represent a ground altar. The great  diversity of seeds discovered is in keeping with first-fruits offerings of  grain, fruit, and wine. The condition of the animal bones indicates clearly  that pieces of meat, probably derived from segments prepared for roasting,  were thrown into the fire and burned along with various plant foods and  perhaps libations. Ground altars show no formal consistency except that they are built  low to the ground, normally constructed one course high above floor level;  some have dividing stones, platforms of various levels, and repositories  for ash and bone debris. If designed principally for chthonian offerings,  the type overlaps in form and function with hearth altars.24 A roughly  contemporary example from the interior of the shrine at Vroulia on Rhodes  has a long row of slabs with no border. It is similar in dimensions to the  Azoria altar, but is punctuated at the center by a single raised platform.25  At Vroulia, while no ash was recovered from on top of the platform itself,  an adjacent pit was filled with burned bone and charcoal, evidently refuse  from the altar. The practice of sweeping debris from altars, allowing it 24.

Another example of a possible ground altar, closer in time and place to  the example at Azoria, is the so-called temple or andreion on the western  hill at Dreros.27 Here a vestibule (pronaos) appears to lead up to a main hall  (sekos) that had an open-ended rectangular container with ash and charcoal,  next to a one-course-high paved platform, some 3.0 m in length.28 The  excavator interpreted the platform as an altar (bomos), while the container  of ash he called a hearth, using both the terms eschara and hestia.29 From  the drawing and description, the altar seems to have been constructed of  two parallel rows of irregular pavers forming an elongated rectangle, open  on three sides. The formal simplicity of the Dreros installation appears  to be typical of ground altars, as does the repository for burned debris.30 Form and Function The Communal Dining Building at Azoria was a sprawling complex of  at least 10 rooms situated prominently on the upper west slope of the  South Acropolis (Fig. 3). In its original condition, it would have displayed  rather imposing megalithic facades with boulders on both the northern  and southern ends of the upper terrace, with equally substantial spine  walls exposed on the inner faces of each of the terraces.31 Furthermore,  the transition between the two levels was an elaborate porch with a wide  stairway and double doors, accommodating considerable foot traffic and  potentially large numbers of people; embellishments of this sort are unpar-  alleled in domestic contexts at Azoria. The position of a dining room  (A2000) near the western end of the vestibule suggests accessibility, but  its narrow doorway also afforded a degree of privacy from the main traffic  areas. Access to A800, the large square room where three well-preserved  krater stands were found, was yet more restricted, controlled via a wooden  door, and accessible only through the altar room (A1900N; Figs. 3, 4).  In contrast, the activities of the altar room would have been essentially  open to the vestibule, easily visible from A1900S through an approximately  2.0-m-wide passage (Fig. 4). The elevated position of the ground altar and  its prominent location immediately to the right of this passage suggest  26. Yavis 1949, pp. 130–131, 134, 385–386, 441–476; Perlman 2010,  (V.

Given its location and the diversity of burned  food debris, we imagine that it would have been used for regular offerings  associated with dining. Although we do not know the function of the  sacrifices or their intended recipients, they were probably chthonian, given  the wide range of food offerings, the character of the burned bone debris,  and the low-bench form of the altar.32 Although we are still studying the distribution of artifacts across the  two terraces, some interesting patterns have emerged (Fig. 3). Dining de-  bris, consisting of food remains and drinking and pouring vessels, was con-  centrated in the porch and vestibule (A1900S), the abandoned kitchen  (A600S), and the dining rooms (A800 and A2000). While not as well pre-  served as faunal material from the dump deposits in A1900S or A600S,  discarded food debris dominated the floor assemblage from A800 as well,  suggesting that it too was used for dining. Sheep/goat and pig are repre-  sented in this room principally by meaty limb-bone elements and rib seg-  ments. A number of sheep or goat bones exhibit chop marks at mid- diaphysis, while cut marks on joint elements (radial carpal) indicate sepa-  ration of the leg at the joint, with further reduction of the meat segment  by chopping through the diaphysis of the long bone. In addition to food debris and numerous drinking and serving ves-  sels,33 one of the most interesting and distinctive types of artifacts found  consistently in the dining deposits of the Communal Dining Building is  the krater stand. The frequency of these objects, considered along with  the other evidence of communal drinking and dining, has informed our  interpretation of the building’s function.34 Krater stands are very rare else-  where on the site, but fragments of no fewer than 14 different examples  have been recovered from the rooms of the Communal Dining Building,  with 11 stands coming from rooms on the upper terrace alone (Fig. 3).  A800 produced the best-preserved examples (three stands). While indi-  vidual stands may have been stored in A1200 and A1400 on the lower ter-  race, fragments from five different stands were recovered in the vestibule  (A1900S), and fragments of three more stands came directly from the din-  ing room (A2000). The formal consumption of wine is suggested not only  by the concentration and condition of these stands, but also by the presence  of numerous cups and skyphoi.35 Furthermore, the type of grape remains  indicates that wine was stored in pithoi in A1200 and evidently offered  on the ground altar in A1900N. Bronze armor is also present in the Communal Dining Building, and  it is perhaps significant that the few identifiable pieces recovered so far at  32. On chthonian cults and offer- 33.

Papanikolopoulos deserves further comment here in light of analysis of the object in 2006,  the discovery of a similar fragment south of Temple B at Prinias in 2003,  and James Whitley’s recent comments on the suitability of the helmet type  to “open” styles of Cretan warfare.38 Like the Prinias example, the Azoria crest is formed from two separate  and opposing pieces of bronze, folded and crimped on the underside  and open at the top, where a row of holes suggests the locations of pins  or rivets used to stabilize the two pieces and form an armature for the  plume (Fig. 7). The elaborate incised decoration on both leaves consists of  registers with chains of lotus flowers, guilloche, and waves. In 2006 Susan  Möller-Wiering, of the Centre for Textile Research of the University of  Copenhagen, examined microscopic pieces of fiber that had been removed  from the dirt caught between the compressed folds of sheet bronze. These  pieces were evidently fragments of thread or twine used to anchor the  plume to the crest. The largest fragment (Fig. 8) is about 3.0 mm thick,  spun in a Z-direction; the fibers are very fine, built up in distinct bundles,  and the dislocations suggest some kind of bast fiber, such as flax or hemp.39 On the basis of its decoration, this type of helmet is normally dated  to the 7th to early 6th century, along with the bulk of the bronze material  forming the notional votive groups from Axos and Aphrati.40 The presence  36.

To accurately assess the patterns  of ritual deposition in Cretan sanctuaries—and then draw historical con-  clusions about social and economic changes in the 6th century—we first  need to disaggregate different contexts of production and consumption  in stratigraphically definable systemic assemblages.42 The existence of the  helmet at Azoria indicates the continued circulation and use of bronze  armor throughout the 6th century, and perhaps a shift in the location of  depositions from sanctuaries to urban contexts such as the Communal  Dining Building.43 THE MONUMENTAL CIVIC BUILDING Excavation in 2004, downslope and west of the Communal Dining Build-  ing, brought to light the remains of two massive walls that formed the south-  eastern corner of a substantial building that we have named the Monumental  Civic Building (D100, D200, and D500) (Figs. 2, 9–14).44 We returned  to this area in 2005 and 2006, tracing the course of the building’s eastern  and northern walls and establishing the overall form of the structure. In  addition, in 2006 a series of trenches opened to the north of the main hall  of the Monumental Civic Building (D900, D1000, and D1400) exposed  the remains of a two-room shrine (the Hearth Shrine) that occupied  a single broad terrace running obliquely to the north (Figs. 2, 9). We  initially assumed that given their topography, these contiguous buildings  were closely related and accessible from separate entrances along a road  on the west. Study and conservation of the architecture in 2007, however,  brought to light clear evidence for a stairway and door in the north wall of  D500 (D523), demonstrating that the two structures are instead parts of  the same building: a large main hall (D500) and an adjoining two-room  shrine (D900–D1000). The Main Hall (D500 ) The main hall of the Monumental Civic Building occupies a broad terrace,  10 m wide, running north of the Service Building at an oblique angle ad- 41.

Although the western side of the building has not been completely  excavated, an exploratory sounding at the southwestern corner revealed a  massive dolomite boulder defining the position of the western wall and the  western limits of the building (Fig. 10). A doorway at this point is indicated  by a neatly carved socket for a wooden post or door pivot. The socket is  a circular depression (ca. 0.14 m diameter) pecked into the surface of a  large schist slab set 2.60 m north of the south wall and on line with the  inner face of the west wall (Fig. 10). West of this socket are two sideropetra  risers with tread wear and several pavers. There are no surviving doorjambs  or identifiable threshold blocks—the terrace is extremely eroded at the  western edge—but it is nevertheless tempting to reconstruct a series of  steps leading up onto a paved vestibule with a single post at the center of  a wide doorway opening onto the interior of the building. The eastern wall (D205) is the best preserved (Fig. 11). It bonds with  the south wall (D103) in the southeast corner of the building, running  northward for a distance of about 21 m before it ends at a prominent rise  in the bedrock at the northeast corner (Fig. 10). It was a single-faced con-  struction composed of an irregular mixture of dolomite and sideropetra  stones, the largest exceeding a meter in length and the smallest roughly  fist-sized (Fig. 11). It is built against a fill of small- and medium-sized  stones and preserved to a maximum height of about 2.4 m above floor level  at its northern end. Although there was evidently no attempt to lay the  stones consistently in regular horizontal courses along the entire length of  the wall, there are shorter stretches built in such a fashion, and a tendency  to set the larger stones into the lowest sections of the wall. An interesting  feature is the presence of roughly vertical seams suggesting that the wall  was laid as a series of discrete segments between 1 and 3 m in length, a  method of construction that appears to have been quite common on the  site during the Archaic period (Fig. 11). The double-stepped bench, first exposed in 2004 against the inner  face of the south wall, was found to run continuously around the southern,  eastern, and northern walls of the room (Figs. 10–14).45 The west side of  the building is extremely eroded and largely unexcavated, so whether this  bench would have continued along the western wall of the room remains  uncertain. The steps are composed of large hammer-dressed blocks of  schist and sideropetra set in two neatly superimposed tiers against the base  of the wall, in some cases laid atop a thin leveling course of small, flattish  stones, so that each step rose to a relatively uniform height of ca. 0.25 m  (Figs. 11, 14). The upper step measures 0.55–0.60 m deep, and the lower  one was shallower by half (0.22–0.25 m). Several steps show considerable  signs of tread wear, especially in the center and outer edges, where the  blocks appear smooth and worn and even occasionally fractured. The top step has two inscribed kernoi, one cut into a sideropetra block  in the southeast corner of the building, and the other in a schist block at  the center of the east side, about 10.15–10.20 m from the north and south  45.

Deposits of roofing material were found preserved  wherever the floor surface was extant; especially deep deposits in the  northeast and southeast corners were embedded with burned olive wood and  other plant material.47 Impressions of burned olive-wood roof beams on the  clay floor take the form of bands of charcoal and burnt-red clay (Fig. 16),  leaving no doubt that the building was roofed, though precisely how the  internal support system was arranged is uncertain. The beam impressions  seem to form regular patterns running perpendicular to the north and  south walls at intervals of ca. 1.5–2.0 m; one beam pattern could also be  discerned running perpendicular to the east wall in the southeast corner. Three post supports are preserved in situ, while numerous other shaved-  bedrock outcroppings and blocks of schist and sideropetra scattered about  the eastern and northern areas of the room could have performed similar  functions during various phases of use and rebuilding (Fig. 10). One  support was located near the northeast corner of the room, its center set  ca. 1.20 m west of the lower step of the east bench and ca. 4.10 m south of  the lower step of the north wall. It is a block of dolomite, hammer dressed  to a diameter of ca. 0.10–0.12 m, and standing about 0.07 m above the  surrounding floor surface. Its upper surface has a slight depression. A  second support of the same material, found in the center of the room, was  partially obscured by the southern end of a wall (D522) that runs through  the middle of the northern half of the room. The wall is possibly a later  installation, even though it sits directly on the floor surface; the single line  of stones extends north–south from the central column base, directly in line  with a third post support in situ: a flat trapezoidal block of schist embedded  in the clay floor some 1.5 m south of the lowest step of the north bench. 47.

The floor of the building is best preserved on the northern and southern  ends and along the east side where both artifacts and post supports survive  intact. Across the central and western areas, roofing clay and floor surfaces  were found preserved in patches, but a pattern of erosion is visible through  the center of the building, exposing the shaved-bedrock surface of the  terrace. Furthermore, later activities on the terrace might have disturbed the  Archaic context. In the south there is a paved platform (1.20 m wide x 2.25 m  long), bordered irregularly by upright slabs of stone, and built directly into  the Archaic wall collapse and on top of burned roofing material (Figs. 10,  12, 14). We cannot assign a specific date or function to this construction,  but the practice of building small, isolated paved rooms (either storage or  work areas) directly into Archaic destruction debris, as in this case, is a  characteristic of Hellenistic activity elsewhere on the site. It is also clear  that the platform makes use of Archaic building materials, such as several  blocks of hearth lining, suggesting that Archaic features within the building  might have been dismantled or disturbed in later periods. The north wall of the building (D523) was preserved for a distance  of about 7.60 m from the northeast corner of the building to the outer  edge of the terrace, which erodes precipitously to the west (Fig. 13). Like  the south wall, it was composed of long rectangular blocks of sideropetra  laid in fairly regular courses inserted between large dolomite boulders. At  its western end, however, the wall was broken by a door and stairway that  climbed up to the terrace of the Hearth Shrine (D900–D1000) to the north  (Figs. 9, 10). The two lower risers of the stair are formed by the blocks of  the stepped seats running along the north wall; indeed, their upper surfaces  show more tread wear than those of the blocks east or west of the doorway.  The third step (ca. 0.18 m high), whose surface was similarly worn, was  made of two stones set flush with the inner face of the wall. Indication  of a fourth step (D905, Fig. 10) is the bedding for additional risers that  originally rose to the level of the platform or corridor west of D900. The  eastern jamb of the doorway was fairly well preserved, its southern block  provided with a slight jog that cradled the door pivot. The only indication  of the position of the western jamb was a pecked surface visible on the  western half of the third step. There were few well-preserved objects on the floor of the Monumental  Civic Building, although sherds of drinking and serving vessels were  plentiful across the excavated area. The fragmentary nature of the evidence is  probably due to both the state of preservation and later post-abandonment  activity on the terrace. Even so, if the building was an assembly and dining  hall, as we propose here, one might not expect an assemblage as rich or  as functionally specific as that found in work areas, kitchens, storerooms,  and dumps. Where the floor of the building was preserved, however, we  did find considerable amounts of food debris. Faunal materials at the  south end of the building have numerous cut marks and show a high level  of burning. Bones of pigs (12 specimens) and sheep/goat (18 specimens)  were recovered in about equal proportions, and all parts of the body are  represented, including meaty upper limbs and joints (scapula, innominate),  as well as the head, lower limbs (sheep or goat), and feet (pig, sheep/goat).  The presence of articulating elements, cut or chop marks on or near the  </page> <page sequence="25"> the  archaic  c iv ic  bu ild ings  at  azor ia 25 Figure 17. D500: chickpeas from  situla. Photo S. Davis epiphyses of limb bones, and burned foot bones strongly suggests that  whole leg segments were brought to the building and then dismembered  for distribution and eating. The assemblage on the floor of the north side  of the building was similar, in that pig and sheep/goat dominate, while  the distinctive cut marks concentrated on articular ends of bones indicate  the separation of leg segments at the joints. The bones found in the south  part of the building show fairly uniform burning, while samples from the  north exhibit greater burning on one side of the bone, with part of the  bone blackened and shading to reddish brown on the less burned portions.  This pattern of burning may have been caused by the intense fire from the  destruction of the building as it reached the food debris on the floor, or by  roasting over an open flame. In 2004 we did recover two complete serving vessels, a plain situla and  a red-slipped lekane near the southeast corner of the building (Figs. 10,  16).48 Recent study of their contents reveals that both vessels contained  food that was being served shortly before the destruction of the building.  The situla (a deep bucket) was found intact and upside down directly on the  floor (Fig. 16). Although its contents had spilled onto the floor, some were  sheltered from the debris of the collapsed ceiling. The pot contained a stew  that included chickpeas (Fig. 17), grapes, onionlike bulbs, small carbonized  twigs from the mint family (possibly herbs such as thyme and oregano),  and sheep or goat meat. The lekane was crushed but it too seems to have  contained a stew, composed of wheat, broad beans, and grapes. While  there are some olive pits and almond shells on the floor of the building,  attesting to the consumption of these items as well, the large serving vessels  containing stews with grains and pulses are consistent with feasting.49 The only other complete artifacts recovered from the destruction de-  posits were a hydria (Fig. 18), an important part of the drinking and dining  equipment, crushed on the floor in the building’s northern area, and a stone  kernos found lying upside down on the upper step of the eastern bench  (Figs. 10, no. 05-1074; 15:3), near the central fixed kernos.

Although this type is normally dated  to the Bronze Age, it is relatively rare, and few of the published examples  come from securely dated contexts.50 The faunal remains recovered in destruction deposits of the main hall  of the Monumental Civic Building point to the practice of feasting. Large  portions of animals are represented in D500, suggesting that whole leg seg- ments and even whole animals were spitted and roasted. Preparation could  have taken place elsewhere, perhaps over open fires on the wide terrace on  the west side of the building, or more likely, in the fireplaces of the Service  Building. For example, at the western edge of the courtyard (B3100) of the  Service Building (Fig. 2), which we discuss below, we recovered a fill deposit  consisting of a buildup of discarded unburned butchering debris, as well  as burned meat elements of cattle, pig, goat, and sheep. The burned meat  elements show distinct patterns of partial exposure to fire, with the burn- ing concentrated on the broken joints and ends of the bones; this evidence  suggests that they had been roasted on an open fire. Moreover, the size  and shape of the rectangular hearth in the adjacent kitchen, B2200/2300,  indicate its suitability for open-fire spit roasting.51 The meat consumed in the Monumental Civic Building was primarily  sheep, goat, pig, and some cattle, and while there are a few marine shells, the  assemblage consists overwhelmingly of remains from these large animals.  Given that the bones derive from meaty upper limbs and joints as well as the  head and lower limbs, it seems that large parts of the animals were brought  into the building for distribution to significant numbers of participants. The  consistent presence of whole leg segments might also indicate the ceremo-  nial and perhaps honorific distribution of sacrificial meat to certain partic-  ipants in the public feast. Victoria Tsoukala has recently demonstrated that 50. For the Middle Minoan (MM)  II–Late Minoan (LM) III date range,  depictions of whole leg joints on 6th- and 5th-century b.c.

In Tsoukala’s analysis, the leg joints  reflect an individual’s participation in festivals of the polis and thus were  symbols of special status and civic identity.52 In marked contrast to the remains in the Monumental Civic Building,  the prepared cuts of meat in the Communal Dining Building are not  whole leg segments, and there is no evidence of the primary butchering  of whole animals within the dining areas of the building; furthermore, the  food assemblage there contains a much wider range of animals than that  represented in D500, including rabbit, cow, dog, and an extensive array of  smaller marine fauna such as limpets, top shell, fish, and urchin. This variety  of species, together with their potentially diverse processing, preparation,  and consumption requirements, implies that the food was brought to the  kitchens and dining rooms of the Communal Dining Building, perhaps  as prepared portions for a number of individual meals; the food remains  suggest the accumulation of debris from various kinds of dining. In the  main hall of the Monumental Civic Building, however, the material from  the floor indicates larger-scale feasting on special occasions that included a  large number of participants. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that  we do not know the total capacity of the dining rooms in the Communal  Dining Building; we have recovered only two complete dining rooms (A800;  and the upper room of A2000), and the southern half of the lower room  in A2000. Given the poor preservation of the building, it is possible that  the western edge of the terrace, now eroded, could have accommodated  more dining rooms. The principal difference between the hall of the Monumental Civic  Building and the dining rooms of the Communal Dining Building may  not have been the number of participants they accommodated, but rather  their respective configurations of space and seating arrangements. That  the design of each building accommodated different groups of diners is  reflected in the differences in the food consumed in the two buildings and  in the equipment they contained.

The Monumental Civic Building seems to com-  bine certain basic functions of LM IIIC and EIA rulers’ houses and hearth  temples, but on a much expanded scale, integrating larger numbers of people  and perhaps inviting wider public participation. The installation of kernoi  could well be evidence of continuity in certain aspects of cult practice, as  well as a deliberate symbolic reminder of the ritual and political centers  of surrounding Early Iron Age communities. If so, then in the Archaic  context, public feasting would have been intentionally dissociated from  a specific elite household and opened to a wider community, perhaps on  occasion to all citizens. The Hearth Shrine (D900 , D1000 , D1400 ) Immediately north of the main hall of the Monumental Civic Building  (D500), and roughly a meter higher than its floor level, is a two-room shrine  of Archaic date (D900–D1000) occupying a broad but topographically  discrete bedrock terrace about 13 m long (north–south) and 6.0 m wide  (east–west) (Fig. 9). Because of the connecting doorway, the shrine is,  properly speaking, an extension of the Monumental Civic Building, but it  consists of two small interconnected rooms forming a coherent architectural  space (Figs. 9, 19).

Below the terrace, along the west face of this retaining wall (A1400), are  the remains of a series of steps (Fig. 19: stepped facade). Because of the ex-  treme erosion, only three rows of steps are preserved for about 4–5 m at the  southern end. The uppermost surviving steps were constructed of two courses  of thick stones (both schist and dolomite) set to a regular depth and height  of about 0.30 m. The second preserved tier, whose top surface shows signs  of heavy tread wear, was composed of large dressed blocks of dolomite and  sideropetra set on a leveling course of small cobbles to the same height and  depth as the upper row. The presence of another leveling course below and  west of the second step indicates the position of at least one more row.  While it is uncertain how many steps there originally were, we reconstruct  a stepped facade rising from a north–south street or courtyard up to a re-  taining wall that would have supported the porch or corridor in front of the  Hearth Shrine. Although smaller in scale, such an arrangement would have  been similar in appearance to the steps of the “theater” (ekklesiasterion) front-  ing the northern face of the eastern end of the temple terrace at Lato. The  steps at Azoria had a very narrow tread width (ca. 0.30 m) and would not  have made very comfortable seating, but given their projected line of ascent  on the slope, it is unlikely that they formed a stepped access to the shrine  itself. The doorway and stair in the northern wall of the Monumental  Civic Building formed the only certain point of convenient access onto  the terrace of the Hearth Shrine. As noted above, the shrine building is made up of two interconnecting  rooms (Fig. 19). The southernmost room (D900), which lay immediately  east of the doorway leading up from the hall of the Monumental Civic  Building, is roughly rectangular in shape (ca. 2.40–2.80 m wide and 5.40 m  long), and it has a clay floor and a rectangular bench (an offering table or  altar, 0.80 x 0.60 m) in the southern half of the room (Figs. 19, 20). Built  against the north face of the bench is a low stone-lined hearth constructed  of three stones set at right angles (ca. 0.70 m x 0.50 m). About 0.50 m north  of the hearth, on the central north–south axis of the room, is a limestone  block, probably a base for an upright used to support roof beams at the  position of a chimney pot or opening in the roof. The doorway to D900  must have been at the southern end of the building, just southwest of the  bench where a schist slab survives as part of the original paved threshold  (Figs. 19, 20); although the west wall is not extant at this spot, there is no  doubt that there was a corridor or porch along the west side of the building  providing access to the room. The northern half of the bench was constructed of flat slabs of schist  and sideropetra laid in eight regular courses to a height of about 0.50 m; the  faces on its southern half were formed by slightly larger slabs of the same  material set upright (Fig. 20). The west and south sides appear to have  been damaged from wall and roof collapse. The height and construction  technique—the use of both coursed and upright slabs—has precise formal  parallels in the 7th-century Altar U and the 6th-century phase of Altar H  at Kommos, although these were large exterior altars evidently used for 61.

Haggis an installation for burned offerings.62 Although some fragmentary bone  was found directly on top of the bench in D900, there was no evidence of  concentrated burned bone or ash debris.  A number of votive objects (Figs. 21–24) were found in a stratum just  above the altar, but clearly displaced from it, as they were concentrated di-  rectly above the area of the paved surface: a miniature skyphos, a ribbed stand,  the poorly preserved head of a terracotta female figurine (possibly Late  Archaic), the lower legs of a coarse Geometric female figurine, fragments  of two cylindrical female figurines (one of which is shown in Fig. 21:1), a  Daedalic plaque depicting a female (Fig. 21:3), and a miniature bronze cup  (Fig. 22). Directly on top of the paved surface of the altar we recovered a  miniature skyphos, two female Geometric figurines (one of which is shown  in Fig. 21:2), one zoomorphic figurine fragment (bovine hindquarters), and  a dowel fragment, probably belonging to a cylindrical figurine. Evidently  fallen from the southern edge of the altar, but suspended just below the  top surface in the matrix of roofing clay and tumble, was a second ribbed  stand (Fig. 23), the lower torso and legs of a Geometric figurine, and the  upper torso of a cylindrical figurine joining with fragments found above  62.

The type has pre-  cise parallels at Ayia Triada, where such figurines are normally dated to the  end of the 8th or beginning of the 7th century b.c.69 The plaque and the  other figurines are Daedalic in style, suggesting a 7th- or early-6th-century  date for the archetypes.70 Two cylindrical wheel-made bodies are hollow  (e.g., Fig. 21:1), slightly concave on the sides, and made of fine pinkish- buff clay fired gray at the core with phyllite and quartzite inclusions. The  arms are pressed rolls of clay with incisions for the fingers. In one example  both arms are folded and touching the breast and collar.71 The head is  moldmade and has a high polos, horizontal side locks, a decorated fillet,  and articulated facial features. The head was inserted into the hollow body  with the support of a clay dowel or tenon, and the exterior of the transition  to the body was then smoothed and roughly pared to obscure the join  (Fig. 21:1). While examples are known from votive deposits at Praisos  (Altar Hill and Mesavrysis) and elsewhere,72 the best-published parallels  for the hollow figurine type come from the Siteia deposit, where both male  and female types are present.73 The bench was intended not merely for displaying these figurines,  but as an offering table and altar for food sacrifices (Figs. 19, 20).74 While  the adjoining hearth on the north side of the bench had been mostly  cleaned of its contents at the time of abandonment, numerous pieces of  yet unidentified burned amorphous organic material were recovered by flo-  tation, as well as fragments of heavily burned and calcined animal bone, not  69.

The association of a hearth and bench is, generally  speaking, a characteristic of Geometric and Orientalizing “hearth temples”  such as the Apollo temple at Dreros and Kommos Temples A and B. Con-  tinuing an ostensibly Bronze Age tradition, these buildings have a fireplace  as the focal point of banqueting, preparation of ritual meals, and hearth  sacrifices, and a bench for the display of offerings.75 Although this is  evidently the case inside the Kommos temples, Shaw admits that figurines  might have been placed on benches or platforms near Altar U; within the  temples, objects may also have been deliberately broken near or on the  hearths as part of a ritual reenactment of sacrificial slaughtering.76 Because  the situation is not as clear-cut as our traditional definitions and typologies  would indicate, the attribution of ritual functions to both the hearth and  bench might be complicated by our tendency toward reductive definitions of  altars; even at Kommos in the Classical period, Altar C was apparently used  for both burned sacrifices and as a platform for the display of figurines.77  In the case of the shrine at Azoria, it is interesting that food remains  are present on the floor and in the hearth of D900, but they are relatively  sparse in comparison to those found associated with the ground altar in  A1900N of the Communal Dining Building. In both instances, however,  it appears as if the altar areas had been cleaned before abandonment, or  exposed to the elements. We might infer that the frequency, scale, and  nature of offerings—and perhaps the frequency with which food-offering  debris was cleared from the altar—differed between the ground altar and  the Hearth Shrine. This difference in ritual behavior is in keeping with our  conceptualization of how the two altars related to the different activities in  the Communal Dining Building and Monumental Civic Building. While  the ground altar in A1900N would have accumulated sacrificial debris, per-  haps first-fruits derived from regular meals, the altar of the Hearth Shrine  could well have been reserved for certain festival occasions or less frequent  formal rituals. A doorway in the northwest corner of room D900 has a step leading  up to a small, irregularly shaped storeroom and kitchen (D1000), about  4.5 m long and preserved to only about 2.5 m wide, eroding sharply on the  west (Fig. 19). While the western wall is no longer extant, the assumption  that the hearth is located in the center of the room suggests an original  width of about 3.0 m. The rectangular hearth (ca. 0.70 x 0.50 m) is con-  structed of long, thin sideropetra blocks on its northern and eastern sides;  its southern curb was hewn from the bedrock.78 In the northeast corner of  the room there are three flat limestone boulders, evidently work platforms  surrounding a rectangular schist quern (Fig. 19). Burning on the floor and  a fallen olive-wood roof beam in the south half of the room are indications  75.

This is true for the Monumental Civic  Building as well as for earlier 8th- and 7th-century hearth temples, which  were socially segregated dining rooms involving combined ritual and  political activities.96 Our reluctance to assign strict definitions to these  spaces stems from ambiguities in the archaeological record, as well as  from formal typologies that cannot always be correlated with epigraphical  evidence.97 The reductive tendency to shape our perception of public  spaces—such as ekklesiasteria, bouleuteria, prytaneia, and andreia—around  individual, epigraphically documented buildings, normative 5th- and 4th- century architectural forms, or perceived (culturally Greek) civic institutions  is quickly confounded by the sheer variety of archaeological and cultural  contexts and sociopolitical configurations evinced throughout the Greek  world, especially in the Archaic period where the evidence is sparse at  best. The situation becomes even more complicated when diachronic  developments are considered, such as the emergence of new Cretan civic  institutions that probably continued to integrate ritual dining into changing  and expanding spheres and scales of social display and political interaction.  There also seems to have been a slow, regionally and chronologically varied  process of Cretan adaptation of nominally Greek civic institutions and  building types and names. The Monumental Civic Building is large (ca. 200 m2 of roofed space),  architecturally elaborate, and equipped with fixed benches, comfortably  seating some 60 to 80 individuals. Depending on the specific activity or  occasion, the arrangement of seated or standing participants, and the use  of the central pillared area, it may have accommodated up to 150 people  at any one time. The plan and scale of the building, however, have no  Early Iron Age predecessors or contemporary parallels on Crete. Indeed,  the form may be new on the island; the building’s appearance is certainly  related to the restructuring of the urban topography and the construction  of new civic institutions and identities that occurred before the start of  the 6th century b.c.

The essential form of the hall—a large roofed space with fixed internal  seating along the walls—recalls characteristics of bouleuteria in later Greek  contexts such as at Argos, Lato, and Messene.100 The stepped structures at  Dreros in the saddle between the acropoleis, east of the so-called prytaneion  and Delphinion, are generally presumed to have been unroofed open spaces,  essentially functioning as an agora, but their size and seating capacity  compares with the scale of the Monumental Civic Building.101  As a communal banquet hall, the Monumental Civic Building appar-  ently served functions that we normally associate with a variety of typically  Greek civic venues (and associated polis institutions) that combined cultic,  social, and political activities in contexts of public commensality. It has a  dining hall accommodating a number of participants, as well as material  evidence of feasting and sacrifice.102 Furthermore, it mixes domestic and  public architectural elements: its physical monumentality and fixed seating  are distinctly formal and public in character, while the architecture of the  Hearth Shrine reflects a traditional (Early Iron Age) domestic architectural  ensemble.103 Finally, the complex of buildings along the west slope has three  hearths for the preparation of food—two within the rooms of the Service  Building (B1500 and B2200/2300),104 and one within the kitchen of the  Hearth Shrine (D1000). An additional hearth in room D900, directly  connected to the altar, is clearly an eschara or sacral hearth for making food  offerings to a female divinity.  The fixed seating of the main hall of the Monumental Civic Building  resembles that of various public buildings at Lato, although the latter are  all much smaller in size, probably not earlier than the 4th century, and  as with most Greek civic buildings, their functions remain uncertain.105  The exedra in the orchestra area at Lato, interpreted by the excavators  as a bouleuterion, has fixed seating lining the walls; even though no roof  tiles were recovered, it is still possible that the building was roofed.106 Its  proximity to the stepped theater area or ekklesiasterion at the base of the  temple terrace suggests public if not civic functions.107 The so-called prytaneion on the northern edge of the agora at Lato pro-  vides another context for comparison.108 The building is divided into two  large rooms (rooms 36 and 37), each about half the size of the main hall  at Azoria, and each fitted with fixed stone benches and central hearths. 100.

The provisioning (storage and  preparation) of food at Azoria was located in the Service Building and  Hearth Shrine (Figs. 2, 9), and so is much larger in scale and more elab-  orate than at Lato, but the juxtaposition of rooms 36 and 37 mirrors the  placement of the Hearth Shrine (D900) and the large dining/ceremonial  hall (D500) at Azoria (Fig. 9). The cult room (room 36) had a large hearth-  like altar, a concave stone offering table (perhaps originally affixed to the  hearth), and a number of figurines (including female and animal), as well  as libation bowls.109 Although it clearly accommodated a number of seated  or standing spectators, its basic assemblage is functionally similar to that  of the altar room of the Hearth Shrine at Azoria (D900). The difference  is that the space of D900 was smaller and more restricted—the hearth and  altar were presumably accessible only to functionaries in the cult—but, as  noted above, the direct connection between D900 and the main hall (D500)  suggests the public performance of rituals. It is the juxtaposition of spaces and basic functions—dining room and  cult room, storage and food preparation—rather than specific architectural  details, that makes the Lato prytaneion an appropriate model for the main  hall and Hearth Shrine of the Monumental Civic Building and the Service  Building. The Azoria buildings evidently had more space for larger numbers  of participants, as well as for specialized food preparation and storage,  but direct access to the shrine’s hearth and the altar was limited.110 In  contrast, the building at Lato seems to compress and centralize storage,  food preparation, and ceremonial areas; furthermore, it restricts movement  into the dining-room space, limiting the number of participants, while  expanding access and permitting larger numbers of spectators in the cult  room. In drawing this comparison we do not mean to present a one-to- one correspondence of institutional names or specific forms of political  organization.111 Indeed, it is important to consider the cultural and  chronological distance that separates these two buildings, keeping in mind  the potentially different sociopolitical relationships and configurations  that governed their use, as well as the historical conditions that eventually  encouraged Cretan cities to adapt normative Greek polis nomenclature  if not aspects of institutional structure. The Lato buildings can, however,  provide a picture of civic architecture and the structuring of communal  spaces that we might use as a framework for beginning to visualize the  activities in the Monumental Civic Building and related complexes.112 109.

The area to the west of this corridor  is eroded, but given the disposition of surviving but fragmentary rooms  B2800, B3300, and B1600 on the terrace below (Fig. 2), it is likely that  another series of rooms once extended all along the slope, their eastern  walls effectively closing off access to the corridor. The entrance to the  Service Building was through the spacious courtyard B3100 from a north– south street that would have run along the west side of D300 (Fig. 26).  The finds from the Service Building rooms are significant because they  provide evidence for the large-scale and centralized mobilization and pro-  duction of food, including the butchering and roasting of meat; the stor-  age of banqueting equipment; and the production of textiles. Because of  context and proximity, we think that the contents of these rooms were  used and consumed in state-sponsored activities conducted in the adjacent  Monumental Civic Building. The central row of rooms, which we have presented in some detail in an  earlier report,113 consists principally of areas for the storage and processing of  food. Two spacious and interconnected kitchens (Fig. 26: B2200/2300 and  B1500) were fitted with rectangular hearths and a wide range of storage  vessels, tools and containers for the processing and cooking of food, and  serving vessels. Food debris on the floor of B2200/2300 was typical of  kitchens elsewhere on the site; traces of grain, pulse, olive, grape, and  almond probably derive from stray bits lost during food preparation and  subsequently carbonized when the building burned. Larger quantities  of these same foodstuffs (including both wheat and barley) were found  in B1500, along with fig and pistachio, suggesting either that there was  more debris on the floor of the B1500 kitchen when it burned, or that  foodstuffs were both stored and prepared in this room. It is worth noting  that the size and condition of the olive pits suggest the presence of whole  fruits, and the deposit of grape pips, skins, and stems is most likely derived  from wine lees (Fig. 27). The adjoining storeroom in B700 had a number  of pithoi, amphoras, and hydrias, as well as mortars and other processing  equipment. Abundant food remains among the broken vessels indicate the  storage of a range of foodstuffs virtually identical to those found in the  adjacent kitchen: wine lees, olive, barley, chickpea, lentil, fig, and possibly  also pear. The focus of work in this area in 2005 and 2006 was to explore two  rooms at the far northern and southern ends of the complex, D300 and  the room in B1700. These rooms communicate directly with the courtyard  spaces in B3100 and B1700 at either end of the corridor (Fig. 26). 113.

Davis B3100 The area to the west of the large kitchen B2200/2300 was excavated in  2005. Here we exposed an 8.75-m-long retaining wall running parallel to  the west side of the kitchen. The wall evidently formed a narrow veranda,  as well as the eastern limit of a wide courtyard (B3100) that provided  access to the east room of D300 in the north and the corridor along the  west side of the Service Building (Fig. 26). The surface of the courtyard,  approximately 30 m2 in area, is shaved bedrock on the south and east sides,  leveled off with clay on the north and fill on the west. Although the western  edge is eroded, a segment of a terrace wall (originally at least 4 m long)  was partially preserved in the northwest corner of the courtyard, evidently  constructed to retain the fill used to level off the bedrock surface. Small  flattish cobbles with worn upper surfaces were found on the far southern  edge of the courtyard and may represent the remains of the original road  pavement. While few artifacts were found in the courtyard itself, at its  western edge and just below it, a substantial dump deposit was uncovered. The fill of this dump consisted of butchering and cooking debris, which  we suspect represents the remains of roasting, butchering, and meat sizing.  The faunal assemblage was unusual in its number of well-preserved bones  of cattle, pig, and goat/sheep. Pig elements included a cranial fragment  and a first cervical vertebra, which bore cut marks on its inferior surface  indicative of butchering to remove the head from the spinal column. Cattle  elements, indicating high meat-yield limb segments, included a proximal  scapula and humerus diaphysis fragment; in addition there was a radius  diaphysis fragment and a first phalange that bore cut marks suggesting  either separation of the low meat-yield lower limb, or perhaps hide removal.  </page> <page sequence="45"> the  archaic  c iv ic  bu ild ings  at  azor ia 45 Sheep/goat bones included both cranial and postcranial elements. A sheep/ goat metacarpal exhibited partial burning concentrated on the broken distal  end of the element; it is possible that this portion, along with other limb  elements from this context, represents a larger limb segment roasted over  an open fire. Likewise, a right astragalus was partially heated or burned  and may be part of an articular unit that was evidently roasted. A sheep/ goat left tibia diaphysis fragment was similarly burned in a way suggesting  that it belonged to an articulated joint of meat roasted over an open fire. Other faunal materials from this context included sheep/goat man-  dibles and isolated teeth, as well as upper front-limb elements indicating  high meat-yield units. The debris dumped in the fill along the west side  of the B3100 courtyard is evidence of both primary butchering as well as  the roasting of joints. Roasting is indicated by patterns of burning that  are consistently limited to areas of the bone that would have been close  to the end of the joint and thus exposed to higher heat or open flame.  The most likely place for spit roasting was in the kitchen adjacent to  the courtyard (B2200/2300), which has a distinctive oblong rectangular  fireplace accommodating large segments of animals (Fig. 26). The faunal  remains from the kitchen—mostly sheep/goat horn cores, cranial debris,  and limb elements—are consistent with the bone dump in B3100. Although  the bones show evidence of burning, given their context and exposure to  heat in the destruction layer of the room, these examples are not reliable  indicators of open-fire roasting. The fragmentary faunal material found  in the hearth itself was burned and included leg segments: a sheep or goat  humerus, a tibia, and a second long-bone diaphysis fragment. B1700 Earlier work in B1700 (south and southwest of B1200) had exposed the  surface of an Archaic courtyard that concealed a complex series of Early  Iron Age and Final Neolithic occupational levels.114 On the southwestern  edge of the courtyard, a large square room came to light, about a meter  lower than the Archaic ground level (Fig. 26: B1700). The east, west, and  south walls are well preserved. While the upper courses of the northern  wall are no longer extant, a 0.70-m-high cut-bedrock socle indicates the  position of the line of the wall and the northern limits of the room.  The entrance into the room was probably in the northeast corner,  where the bedrock has been worked to form a bedding for steps made of  boulders and a limestone slab. We excavated only the northern third of  the room in an exploratory sondage, in order to preserve an old olive tree  that occupies the central and southern half of the room. The room was  originally quite large (ca. 4.50 m north–south and ca. 3.30 m east–west); it  has a clay floor, and a large schist slab was fitted into a worked rise in the  bedrock on the north. The pecking on the surface of the slab indicates that  it was a work platform, and the finds from the exposed area of the clay floor  surface consist entirely of stone tools: two handstones, a burnisher, and a  small whetstone.

The Olive Press  (D300 ) At the opposite end of the corridor is the northern courtyard (B3100),  which provided access to a large two-room structure (D300) (Figs. 26, 28).  Excavation in 2004 had recovered the top extant wall lines of the Archaic  eastern room as well as a square compartment of Hellenistic date, which was  constructed over the northern third of the room directly on top of Archaic  destruction debris.115 In its Archaic phase, the oblong east room was quite  substantial, some 30 m2 in area (3.20–3.40 m east–west and ca. 9.50 m  north–south), and accessible directly from the courtyard through a well- built doorway and a short stairway of two sideropetra risers, whose surfaces  show considerable signs of tread wear (Fig. 28). The door was evidently  fitted with a wooden frame whose original position is indicated by a  pattern of peck marks still visible on the jambs (Fig. 29). The room has a  stone-built bench (ca. 1.20–1.40 m long, ca. 0.85 m deep, and ca. 0.45 m  high) set against the southern part of the east wall. Four flat stones near  the western wall most likely served as pithos stands.  Finds from the room consisted of an iron ring, two iron arrowheads, a  piece of an iron nail, a fragment of sheet bronze, three large quartzite querns,  and a number of pithoi, one of which was mostly preserved and found  broken across the northern half of the room (Figs. 28, 30). At ca. 1.63 m  in height, this is among the largest pithoi recovered from the site. It is also  elaborately decorated with appliqué and some incised and stamped motifs,  most of which are restricted to one side of the vessel, suggesting a conceptual  front and back and an element of display. The size and shape of the east room and the presence of the pithoi and  stone stands indicate that the principal function of the room was storage.  The querns were found lying immediately south of the bench near the  east wall of the room; their position and the lack of handstones or other  implements from the floor deposit suggest that they had been stored in the  room, perhaps waiting to be used in one of the adjacent kitchens (B1500,  B2200/2300), the courtyard (B3100), or in the west room of D300. One of  the querns is very large, one of the largest from the site, measuring about  41 x 30 cm. The bottom is worked flat and the top is pecked and abraded  and has a slight concave long section. As is typical of the reworking of  the face, the top is abraded smooth, almost to a polish at the outer edge. Numerous fragments of olive pits were also recovered from this room  (Fig. 31). The lack of complete or nearly complete pits and the consistent  small size and dull rounded edges of the pieces suggest they derive from  press cake, rather than whole olives.116 Furthermore, the concentration  of the olive fragments was in the southern end of the room, that is, away  from the smashed pithos, suggesting that the debris was originally on the  floor, or perhaps stored in sacks rather than in the pithos (Fig. 28). While  olive is clearly the primary foodstuff represented, sparse quantities of grape,  wheat, barley, pulse, almond, and fig were also recovered from the room,  indicating the storage of other foodstuffs as well. 115.

Fitzsimons Most of its western wall is no longer extant, but a line of dolomite boulders  running ca. 4.20 m south from the western end of the room’s north wall  preserves the course of its foundations. The absence of extant doorways  means that the room’s main entrance was set somewhere in the southern  portion of the west wall, accessible directly from a street running along  the west side of the building. The room has two large post supports on its  long axis, and a stone-lined hearth (Figs. 28, 32). In the southern part of  the room, the space is bisected by a long bench that runs perpendicular to  the east wall, immediately below the window into the east room (Figs. 28,  32). Parallel with this bench, the south wall of the room has three neatly  constructed niches or sockets, each about 28 cm wide and about 40–45 cm  deep (Figs. 28, 29). Adjacent to the bench on the west is a stone mortar  block, a cylindrical stone (roller crusher), and a slab-built bin (Figs. 28,  32, 33). The features and contents of the western room suggest the elements  117.

Haggis constructed of tightly packed dolomite and sideropetra stones laid in even  courses to a height of about 0.40–0.45 m; a large, flattish slab of dolomite  (ca. 0.20 m high) was set atop the eastern end of the bench directly beneath  the window into the eastern room (Fig. 32). The floor level immediately  north of the press bench was approximately 0.30 m lower than that to the  south—that is, the press bench rose about 0.65–0.75 m above the floor  on the north side. The depression formed by the lower floor level at this  juncture probably served to provide additional space and maneuverability  for collection or separation vessels.118 On the southern edge of the top  surface of the press bench, a few stones project slightly higher, probably  positioned to facilitate setting the presses at a slight angle to the north.  On the floor, two limestone blocks were found flush on opposite sides of  the press bench: one block is nested on two stones against the north face  of the bench toward the west (Fig. 28), and the other is embedded in the  floor toward the middle of the south side of the bench (Fig. 32). Given  their positions, it is possible that they supported wooden posts or uprights  that braced the beams when their height was adjusted, or when sacks of  olives were moved in and out of the presses.

Foxhall has noted that the level of the press beams used in lever-and- weights presses could be periodically adjusted as the height of the olive  sacks gradually diminished.119 The sockets in the south wall are preserved  to a height of ca. 0.40 m, but they could easily have stood much higher  originally, since the wall is not preserved above this level. It seems possible,  then, that during the initial pressing, the beams could have been set at a  relatively high level by inserting stones into the lower sections of the niches;  the beams could then have been lowered as the height of the olive sacks  diminished by removing these stones. The slight variation in the extant  height of the press bench itself may indicate that presses could also have  been set at various levels for the same purpose. Although no presses were recovered in situ on top of the bench itself, we  did find two fragments of rectangular press beds in a layer of wall collapse  and destruction debris at precisely the level of the top of the bench, and  presumably displaced from it (Fig. 34:3). A third intact press bed was found  reused and built into the later Hellenistic room that was constructed on  top of the destruction debris in the northern end of the eastern storeroom  (Figs. 28, 35). The reused press bed is identical in form to the fragments  from the Archaic tumble layer: it measures about 35–40 cm2 and would  have fit easily across the width of the bench. The square-trough type with  tapering rim is not easily dated in post–Bronze Age contexts, in which flat  circular and teardrop-shaped presses become more common, especially  in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.120 Further evidence for olive-oil  processing in the room includes a stone weight found lying directly on  the floor against the north wall (Figs. 28, 32, 34:4). The stone is a pierced 119. Foxhall 2007, pp. 137–138. dolomite boulder (ca. 36 cm high, 30.5 cm wide; 18.3 kg) that is naturally 120.

The side of the cylinder is  pecked, worn, and slightly battered on its working surface, which is about  17–20 cm wide along three-quarters of the circumference; the rest of the  cylinder’s side has been roughly shaped into two broad facets. We think  that the principal use of this cylindrical stone was as a roller for crushing  </page> <page sequence="54"> 54 donald  c . hagg i s  e t  al . olives: it was rolled, or more properly rocked across the surface of the adja-  cent rectangular block, using the pecked side of the stone as the actual  working surface (Fig. 37). The crushed material could then have been con-  veniently swept into the adjacent bin.122 The cylindrical stone was found, however, resting directly on the top  of a conglomerate (beachrock) quern measuring about 35 cm in width and  length and about 5–8 cm in height; its edges were worked flat with two  corners and one rounded edge, forming a D-shape. The quern was sup-  ported by small schist and sideropetra slabs that had clearly been used  to level off the north and south sides of its eastern edge. The end of the  cylinder with the sockets was facing up, and the other was lying flush with  the top surface of the beachrock quern underneath (Fig. 32).The top of  the quern is abraded smooth from use, and the bottom of the cylindrical  stone is both pecked and abraded, suggesting an intentional use of this facet  for grinding. Given the stone’s position and its exact fit atop the quern, it  is possible that the roller crusher had a secondary use for grinding. The  depressions or sockets on the top of the cylinder, as well as the bevel at the  bottom edge, would have provided grips to facilitate rotating the stone and  keeping it positioned on the quern surface. The stone’s weight would have  been effective for grinding grain into flour, indeed to a finer grain and in  greater amounts than could be obtained using the standard stone-tool kits  found in this room and in other kitchens on the site. The cylindrical stone and quern were found wedged between the stone  block and bin (Figs. 32, 33). The bin is a roughly circular basin, measuring  about 0.45 x 0.60 m at floor level; its sides are constructed of schist slabs and  one pithos sherd set on end, splaying to a diameter of about 0.80–0.90 m  (Fig. 33). The pithos sherd, consisting of part of the neck and rim, depicts  a centaur in relief (Fig. 38). The entire structure was evidently supported  on the exterior by a packing of phyllite clay. The bin could have been lined  with a piece of fabric or a sack to contain and bind the olives for placement  on the adjacent presses. Deposits of crushed olive, similar to that found  in the eastern room (Fig. 31), were recovered across the floor of the west  room, but especially in the area immediately north of the press bench and  east of the basin (Fig. 28).

We reconstruct  it as an open-sided cooking stand that could have been positioned directly  over the hearth to support a cooking pot containing water (Fig. 39).125 While no separation tank or jar was found in situ below the press bench,  a complete olive-oil separator was recovered in the adjacent storeroom in  the central rooms of the Service Building (B700) (Fig. 34:2), and a base  fragment of another separator, probably reused, was found in the small  Hellenistic room built over the north end of the eastern room of D300.  The spouted jar from B700 is typical of oil separators from the Archaic and  Classical periods; the best evidence comes from Cypro-Classical contexts at  Kition and Nicosia and representations in vase painting.126 Possibly related  to the olive processing in D300 is a small green-purple phyllite mortar  (trapetum mortarium) that was found lying near the oil separator in B700 125.

On  the south side of the room, south of the press bench, there was another  small conglomerate (beachrock) quern about the same size as that in the  northeast corner, and nearby, a flattened oval cobble with one battered end,  an abraded end and facet, and evidence of pecking all over the surface.  Unlike the cylindrical stone and beachrock quern, which would prob-  ably have been used for heavy grinding, perhaps for the production of  flour, the other tool kits from the room were probably used for breaking  up grains and pulses into coarser particles for boiling. As in the household  assemblages from Azoria, cobbles of pumice were found in both the north  and south areas of the west room of D300, and in some cases they were  closely associated with the querns (Fig. 40).

Although  not probative, the clusters of consonants (xi-rho-tau) may be characteristic  of Eteocretan.134 To date, we have recovered 17 inscribed sherds (graffiti  and dipinti) from Azoria. Most examples come from stratified 6th- and  early-5th-century contexts, providing a broad terminus ante quem for their  production and use.135 The commonness and diversity of graffiti at the site,  in some cases inscribed directly on early-5th-century vessels,136 suggest  informal and practical uses of writing throughout the Archaic period.137 130.

The installation at Azoria preserves  evidence for all stages of oil processing (crushing, pressing, settling, and  separation), providing the only well-preserved example of a lever-and- weights style press from the Archaic Greek Aegean.138 This evidence is of  some importance, as its context predates the widespread use of the rotary  crusher and screw presses that have shaped the notional Hellenistic and  Roman model of the procedures, equipment, scale, and volume of olive-oil  extraction in ancient Greece. The only other reported Archaic beam press is  at Klazomenai, where the ambitious reconstruction of the wooden elements  is at best problematic.139 Perhaps most important is that the olive press at  Azoria is located directly within a complex of civic buildings. This would  suggest the appropriation of olives for state-sponsored processing, as well  as the consumption of oil in formal civic venues, such as the neighboring  kitchens and the Monumental Civic Building.140 The principal uses of oil probably included food preparation, lighting,  and special adornment and cleansing. Olive oil was a semiluxury product  in Classical Greece,141 and its use would have indicated the character and  formality of an activity, as well as the participants’ status and social and  political identity.142 Embedded in its various uses were social-symbolic values  derived from the mobilization and processing of olives: the expense of slave  or serf labor and cost of transportation, the specialized equipment used in  pressing, and the time-consuming and labor-intensive extraction process.  These are indicated at Azoria by the evidence of methodical crushing,  slow pressing, and low output relative to labor input. Within its large and  architecturally elaborate physical context, the olive press forms part of a  public building that was related spatially, functionally, and visually to civic  and ceremonial activities conducted on the west slope of the South Acropolis. Although it is possible that the installation could have served as a  communal press, merely centralizing production for the wider community  and allowing redistribution to the various households on the site, this  seems unlikely, given its context within the Service Building, the relative  cost and difficulty of transporting olives from distant rural estates, and  the overwhelming evidence of household production in Bronze Age and  Classical contexts. Olive oil would, however, have been needed for a variety  of formal meals prepared in the kitchens of the Service Building itself. A  possible example might be the stews found in the situla and lekane on the  floor of the main hall of the Monumental Civic Building (Figs. 16, 17).143  Oil could also have been used for personal adornment in preparation for  138.

Finally, lighting would have been crucial,  not only for practical applications—small table lamps have been found  in both the Service Building and Hearth Shrine (Fig. 25)—but also for  conducting formal ceremonies within the main hall of the Monumental  Civic Building.144 Though the rooms of the Service Building were surely  used for food storage and preparation, they also seem to have been pantries  containing a variety of fine skyphoi and cups, kraters, and pouring and food- serving vessels. In these ceramic assemblages there are large bowl-shaped  bar-handled lamps; similar lamps are found in the Communal Dining  Building, although not yet in domestic contexts.145 These large lamps  were certainly meant to be carried with two hands, and given their special  form, with the handles curving below the level of the base, they might also  have been hung from the rafters of rooms in both the Communal Dining  Building and the Monumental Civic Building. We imagine that olive-oil processing at Azoria was the purview of the  household, most likely on rural estates near the trees or orchards (or within  buildings in the city not yet excavated); what we have found so far is archae-  ological evidence for storage and consumption within both domestic and  public buildings. The olives found in household assemblages across the site  were no doubt a staple for regular family consumption, but the largest quan-  tities by far come from storerooms in the Communal Dining Building and  the Service Building. Thus, we can assume that olives would have had a  special place in the political economy of early Cretan cities, where the best  arable land would have been given over to subsistence foods such as bar-  ley and wheat and small garden crops. Although it is well known that pay-  ments of oil, or tithes, were derived from the sacred trees in the Athenian  context of the Panathenaia,146 our Cretan sources are not forthcoming. A  3rd–2nd-century b.c. inscription from Dreros (IC I ix 1), however, hints at  the relationship between olive cultivation and the city’s political territory:  in the context of a conflict between Dreros and Miletos over land, the in-  scribed oath of the ephebes against Lyttos requires individuals, presumably  members of the agela, to plant an olive and ensure its continued cultivation  under penalty of a fine of 50 staters. The Archaic Spenthisios decree does  mention payments of food (such as meat or must wine) into and out of the  andreion, but we can only infer from the archaeological evidence that oil or  olives were part of these obligations, perhaps as contributions to communal  feasts. There is, however, a late (1st century b.c.) decree from Axos (IC II  v 35) dealing with arrangements for a festival and obligations of the kosmoi;  individuals are mentioned in the inscription as being required to furnish 144.

Why was oil production  centralized and controlled? Was oil production geared to certain occasions  or religious festivals? Were the olives derived from public lands or sacred  trees? Certainly a volume of production that exceeded normal levels of  household use would have required larger and more permanent equipment;  it is also possible that normal household production, even on rural estates,  could not meet the demands required by the dining and lighting needs of  the Monumental Civic Building. We conclude that the ritualized nature  of oil processing for consumption in state ceremonies necessitated its own  special equipment and building. What seems clear is that the scale of  production and degree of elaboration required a substantial investment in  architecture, physical machinery, and personnel. Form and Function The Service Building is unusual in its size and architectural complexity,  and in the variety of functions related to food storage and processing that  it served. As in the case of the Monumental Civic Building, there are no  clear formal predecessors or contemporary parallels for the complex. The  so-called prytaneion at Dreros, dated normally to the 7th century b.c., might  have served a similar function, while rooms 38 and 39 at Lato were appar-  ently storerooms provisioning rooms 36 and 37 in the prytaneion.148 The  Dreros prytaneion is a five-room building situated just south of the temple  and near the steps of the putative agora. While the precise date (7th–3rd  century) and function of the various rooms remain unclear, based on  147.

Hearth Shrine and Service Building at Azoria. </page> <page sequence="62"> 62 donald  c . hagg i s  e t  al . The Service Building represents an important component of the po-  litical economy of the early city. Storage in pithoi is evident throughout the  complex, but rooms B700, B1200, and D300 (east room) were probably built  specifically as storage magazines (Fig. 26). Food preparation is indicated by  the permanent hearths and cooking equipment in B2200/2300, B1500, and  D300, and specialized processing is evident at both ends of the complex in  D300 and B1700. While the exterior spaces of B3100 and B1700 might  have served as work areas, there are no specific indications of such activities,  beyond the discarding of butchering and roasting debris. The courtyard  in B1700 contained a deposit of some 20 goat mandibles,153 and above  we discussed a bone dump at the western edge of B3100. The building  also housed pantries for food-processing equipment, such as mortars (one  a trapetum) and an olive-oil separator in B700 and querns in D300, as  well as a plethora of drinking and dining vessels, including kraters, large  lamps, a podanipter, and a krater stand.154 The food remains in the kitchens  and stores (B700, B1500, and B2200/2300)—grape, olive, wheat, barley,  chickpea, lentil, fig, almond, and pistachio—represent a diverse assemblage  of consumable products, readily available for final processing and con-  sumption. Although wheat and barley as well as processing tools such as  querns are present in the rooms, there is no evidence of large-scale grain  storage, and the primary processing of grain does not seem to have been a  major activity of civic concern. The small querns and mortars found in these  spaces (e.g., Fig. 40) seem more appropriate for small-scale cracking or pound-  ing of cereals, pulses, or other foods during the preparation of meals. The  scarcity of grains and the complete absence of chaff debris at Azoria points  to decentralized, if not rural, primary storage and processing of grain for  flour, a pattern that is remarkably different from Early Iron Age domestic  contexts on the Kastro, where chaff predominates in floor deposits.155 The  contrasting EIA and Archaic patterns of grain production and processing  suggest significant changes in the economic organization of households  and their relationship to the city.156 The processing of olive oil, however, stands in marked contrast to  other food-producing activities. Its separate structure (D300) takes up  almost 100 square meters of space (Figs. 28, 32), and while olives might  have been stored for a short time before pressing, the remains from D300  consist entirely of crushed olive—either discarded debris or the remains  of press cake gathered and stored to be used as fuel in hearths throughout  the complex (Fig. 31). Thus, with the exception of olive-oil extraction,  the Service Building seems to have been used for the final stages of  preparation of food for large-scale dining, most likely meals, banquets,  and other occasions of feasting that took place in the Monumental Civic  Building. This unusual concentration of food processing and, we can infer,  the organization and mobilization of both produce foodstuffs and labor  suggest a state-level enterprise that, by the 6th century b.c., must have  been driven by a new civic institutional structure. 153.

Together they comprise the main public  buildings of the city center. Access to them was likely from the south, a  wide expanse of relatively level and open ground, perhaps an agora, lying  south and west of the Cult Building; admittedly, however, identifiable  streets are not sufficiently preserved on the outer edges of the western ter-  races for us to know for certain the routes of access. Nor have we been  able to identify any direct connection between the two complexes. What  is interesting is that while both buildings have considerable space allocated  to similar functions and contexts of organized dining, they exhibit different  organizations of space and assemblages of animal bones and seeds, and  potentially different social groupings and contexts of dining. Furthermore,  the different locations and access patterns of the cult rooms suggest very  different dynamics of use. The Communal Dining Building and Monumental Civic Building  mirror each other’s basic functions: both have substantial pithos storage and  apparently reduplicated kitchen and storage spaces, cult installations, and  ceremonial rooms that show indications of drinking and dining activities.  The physical elaboration of the architecture, the volume of dining debris,  and their unusual artifact assemblages distinguish these buildings from  domestic contexts on the site. Even though the two structures share gen-  eral characteristics, they have very different forms that were designed for  different kinds of feasting. The layout of the ceremonial rooms in the  Communal Dining Building is complex and compartmentalized, indi-  cating the division of activities and the segregation of social groups and partic-  ipants. Food-processing and storage facilities are centralized on the lower  terrace, interconnected, and physically separate from the ceremonial rooms.  While a substantial part of the western edge of the building is not preserved,  it is clear that the communication patterns within the building are dendritic,  with exclusive access to the rooms of the upper terrace mediated (and  controlled) by the porch and vestibule (Fig. 3). The altar room (A1900N) is  fully integrated into the space of the upper terrace. This room was essentially  a physical extension of the vestibule, lying between A800 and A2000, and  it most likely received a heavy volume of traffic during the daily activities  conducted in the building. The Service Building shows a similar concentration of reduplicated  kitchens and storerooms—an allocation of space distinctly separate from the  main ceremonial areas (Fig. 26). The adjacent Monumental Civic Building  has a single undivided hall that was clearly designed to accommodate large  groups of people in assemblies that were probably more openly communal,  or perhaps less restricted or segregated than those of the Communal Dining  Building. The Hearth Shrine is directly connected to the main hall but has  restricted access; a single doorway in the north wall of the hall is its exclusive  entrance (Fig. 9). The rooms of the shrine are small, and practical use would  have been limited to a few people. The Hearth Shrine has its own kitchen  (D1000) that was separate from the food-preparation areas of the Service  Building, and thus no doubt was used for producing special meals or specific  </page> <page sequence="64"> 64 donald  c . hagg i s  e t  al . offerings for consumption by priests or select members of the community.  The terrace in front of the shrine, if open, could well have been a staging  area for public viewing of ceremonies, but the actual votive process seems  to have been the exclusive purview of functionaries or magistrates, an elite  who rationed the use of votives and controlled the ritual.157 It is still possible,  however, that offerings could have been paraded in and out of public view  within the main hall of the Monumental Civic Building. In general, the ceremonial areas of the Communal Dining Building  are internally differentiated. Separate rooms probably accommodated  different groups, sodalities, or even perhaps different modes or occasions  of drinking and dining. The remains of meals are concentrated in A800,  A2000, and A1900S, with a dump of debris in the adjacent abandoned  kitchen in A600S. Krater stands were scattered across the upper terrace,  with concentrations in the same rooms that contained the dining debris.  The krater stands exhibit distinctly different styles and sizes that might  be related to the differentiation of kinship groups or other corporate iden-  tities involved in feasting.158 The organization of space in the building thus  presents a picture of differential access and divisions of groups of partici-  pants. The layout demonstrates the careful structuring of social space, yet  maintains the openness and accessibility of the cult room; the two clearly  identifiable dining rooms flank the vestibule (A1900S) and the adjoining  ground altar in A1900N (Fig. 3). Given the extent of disturbance from  deep plowing and erosion along the western edge of the lower terrace, it is  likely that other dining rooms have been lost, such as the poorly preserved  hall west of A2000. The main hall of the Monumental Civic Building presents an entirely  different picture: open participation of people irrespective of group or  subgroup identity. This is not to say that distinctions were not expressed,  for example, through the differentiated portioning of meat, such as the leg  segments, or other foods, or even by means of arranged seating within the  building. But the open plan and fixed seating around the sides indicate a  structured communal experience and public witnessing of ritualized activ-  ities. Although artifact remains on the floor of D500 were sparse, dining  debris is found throughout the hall. The only decidedly exclusive space  within the building is the Hearth Shrine, where the routes of access would  have permitted public display inside D500, but would have restricted  direct use of the altar and participation in the preparation and deposition  of votives and food. In contrast, the altar room in the Communal Dining  Building (A1900N) was accessible to anyone entering the vestibule, shows  a considerably greater variety of burned food offerings, and contains no  nonfood votives. This pattern suggests holocaust sacrifices, perhaps first- 157.

Thus, community  integration and identity are reflected in both buildings, but in different  ways. On the one hand, the open plan of the Monumental Civic Building  encouraged communal feasting in which status distinctions were probably  emphasized through the nuances of rituals, and perhaps through the  ceremonial allocation of sacrificial meat or special meals. On the other  hand, segregation was the rule in the Communal Dining Building. The  multiplicity of separate dining rooms within a single building, all associated  with similar kinds of vessels and foods, made it possible for participants  to dine together, but separately—to be part of the civic community, while  at the same time expressing corporate or other social/kinship distinctions.  The nature of the ceremonies and feasts in these two civic contexts suggests  distinct but parallel modes of interaction and expressions of sociopolitical  identity in the early city.
