<plain_text><page sequence="1">PSALM 48 JULIAN MORGENSTERN, Hebrew Union College Introduction APPARENTLY it has never occurred to any scholar that Ps. 48 may not be a literary unit. At any rate, without a single exception biblical commentators have so treated it. But this very insistence upon the unity of the Ps. has given rise to widely differing interpretations of it; and each quite naturally with an equal justification. Those scholars1 who center their attention upon vv. 5-8 inter prêt the poem as a historical psalm, celebrating the deliverance of Jerusalem and of Judah by Yahweh, in surprising and almost miraculous manner, from some seemingly irresistible enemy and depicting the exultation of the people at this manifestation of Yahweh's power and of His protection of and favor towards them. They are in complete agreement that the reference is to some specific event in Jewish history. And, following the lead of Theodore of Mopsuestia, almost without exception they main tain that this specific event is the somewhat mysterious and traditionally miraculous withdrawal of Senacherib from the seige of Jerusalem in 701 B.C.3 They regard the Ps. as practically contemporaneous with this event and so as pre-exilic, and speci fically as having been composed very soon after 701 B.C. At first glance this interpretation seems not at all unreason able, in fact even quite satisfying. Therefore, no doubt, this inter pretation of the Ps. was generally accepted without question by almost two generations of modern biblical scholars and even today still finds its staunch defenders.3 Some scholars, however, 1 Ewald, Wellhausen, Nowack, Baethgen, Kessler, Kautzsch, Kônig, But tenwieser, et al. 2 2 Ki. 18.13-19.37; Isa. 36-37. 3 Most recently and with most detailed argument, Buttenwieser, and also, in part at least, Oesterley.</page><page sequence="2">2 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [2] perceived clearly that vv. 5-8 suggest the Senacherib episode only remotely and only with the play of a certain amount of imagination, coupled with some slight verbal revision; therefore they preferred to regard these w. as recounting, in a rather generalizing manner, Yahweh's by no means infrequent deliver ances of Jerusalem from the attacks of hostile kings. And having then disposed of vv. 5-8 in this rather cavalier manner, they concentrate their attention upon the remainder of the Ps. and interpret it as a pilgrimage psalm, the chant of a pilgrim, or of a body of pilgrims, coming joyously from somewhere in the Diaspora to Jerusalem to celebrate there one of the three annual pilgrimage festivals.4 Of these scholars some, such as Duhm and Kittel, ascribe the Ps. to the immediate pre-Maccabean period, while others, notably Baethgen and Briggs, regard it as the product of the early Persian period. Briggs and Kittel, despite their interpretation and dating of the Ps. as a unit, still see in vv. 5-8 a definite reference to the Senacherib episode. Bertholet, following Duhm in this, becomes quite specific and holds that the pilgrim or pilgrims in question come from the far South, presumably from Upper Egypt. Staerk interprets vv. 5-8 as an eschatological utterance. Apparently influenced by this suggestion of Staerk, Gunkel goes further and interprets the Ps. as an eschatological picture of the siege of Jerusalem by the kings of the earth at the "end time" and their overthrow by Yahweh just outside the walls of Jerusalem. This is the implication of vv. 5-8 specifically.5 The remainder of the Ps., he contends, is liturgical in character; it provides the liturgy for a festal procession, with vv. 1-10 sung by a group of worshipers within the Temple and vv. 11-15 by a solemn procession around the city.6 He makes no attempt to fix the date of the Ps.7 4 So Duhm, Briggs, Staerk, Kittel, Bertholet. Cheyne seems to waver between the two interpretations. 5 At the same time Gunkel refutes quite convincingly the interpretation that vv. 5-8 refer to the Senacherib episode. 6 Though whether by the same or by a different group of worshipers, he does not indicate. 7 Buttenwieser rejects Gunkel's interpretation, though without convincing refutation.</page><page sequence="3">[3] psalm 48 3 Mowinckel8 too regards this as a procession-Psalm, one of the group which he has termed "Thronbesteigungspsalmen," more specifically a "Sionshymnus," and likewise, still more specifically, attended by a procession around the city upon the New Year's Day, with the ark borne along in the midst of the procession; and this despite the indisputable fact that nowhere in the Ps. is there any mention of the ark whatever, or even the slightest hint or suggestion thereof. Mowinckel contends that the Ps. cannot refer to any specific historic event, such as the siege of Jerusalem by Senacherib, and this particularly since the tradition of the catastrophe which befell this monarch was alto gether unhistoric. On the other hand, the tenses of the verbs in vv. 5-8 forbid any eschatological interpretation.9 Since, as he maintains, in this festal procession upon the New Year's Day the ark played a conspicuous role,10 the Ps. must come from the period when the ark was still in existence and the center of this all-important cult-act, viz. from pre-exilic times.11 In this interpretation Mowinckel is followed closely by May," who holds, however, that the festal procession in which the ark participated, and of which this song was the liturgy, was not around the walls of the city, as Mowinckel suggests upon the basis of v. 13, but that it was from the Mount of Olives to the Temple, and that the festival in question was the Passover rather than the New Year's Day. Finally, Johnson,13 likewise starting from Mowinckel's hypoth esis, also holds that the Ps. is the liturgical record of a ritual 8 Psalmenstudien, II, 4, 61 ff., 92, 106, 120, 126 ff„ 159, 191. » Ibid., pp. 6-12. 10 It is to this circuit of the ark around the city, so he holds, that w. 10 ff. refer {ibid., pp. 105 ff.; 128 ff. ; 159). This circuit of the ark around the city upon the New Year's Day, he contends, imparts strength to the walls and makes the city impregnable. It can scarcely be denied that Mowinckel sees in these vv. far more than they seem to express, even when interpreted, not merely literally, but with some freedom.

Quite correctly he finds strong support for his interpretation in the figure of Mot in North-Semitic mythology, and particularly in the myth of the combat between Mot and 'Al'eyan Ba'al.15 In this interpretation of the Ps. as a dramatic or mimetic work he is closely followed by T. H. Gaster.16 From all this it is plain that Ps. 48 has, within the course of the last century, experienced an exceedingly wide range of inter pretation. Nor is there at the present moment any measure of agreement among biblical scholars as to its date, background and meaning. Manifestly too this wide latitude of interpretation results mainly from the almost self-evident fact that vv. 5-8 seem to have little in common with the thought and spirit of the remainder of the Ps. And it has become clear that it is only by forcing the meaning of either the one or the other of these two sections of the Ps., only by reading into them much that is either not present there at all or else that can be conceived only with the help of an exceedingly fertile imagination, can any plausible harmony and unity of thought between them be achieved. Yet apparently the possibility seems never to have suggested itself to any biblical scholar that vv. 5-8 may be an interpolation into the Ps. proper and that therefore the themes of each of these 14 Cf.

This is all the more surprising because, as we will soon see, vv. 9-15 follow perfectly upon vv. 2-4, without even leaving the slightest impression of any lacuna between these two parts of the Ps. II Vv. 5-8 ( = Ps. 48B) As we have already learned, several scholars17 have contended that in the small section, w. 5-8, the tenses of the verbs indicate conclusively that the passage as a whole refers to some specific event of the historic past, and that the attempt to interpret them in an eschatological sense, as Staerk and Gunkel do, is far fetched and altogether contrary to the canons of Hebrew syntax, and is manifestly nothing more than the expression of sheer despera tion over their failure to find a satisfactory explanation of the vv. with reference to any known historic event. As has been pointed out, apparently the only historic event with which scholars, from the time of Theodore of Mopsuestia to the present day, have been able to associate this passage is the traditional deliverance of Jerusalem from Senacherib and his Assyrian host in 701 B.C. Even certain commentators, as we have seen,18 who regard the Ps. as a post-exilic composition, none the less concede that these vv. express a strong reminiscence of the deliverance from Senacherib. Other commentators, however, even though unable to correlate these vv. satisfactorily with any other his toric event, have pointed out how inadequately they can refer to the Senacherib episode. The vv. themselves make no mention whatever of Jerusalem, and it is only from their setting in the present Ps. that they may be thought to refer to Jerusalem. And obviously, if these vv. be regarded as an interpolation into the Ps., and therefore as having no primary connection whatever with the Ps. proper, then absolutely nothing remains to suggest that they refer in any way to Jerusalem and its deliverance from ,י Mowinckel, op. cit., 63; Buttenwieser, 104. 18 Briggs and Kittel.</page><page sequence="6">JULIAN MORGENSTERN [6] a siege, either by Senacherib or by any other conqueror. Further more, the one specific historical event to which the vv. make definite and indisputable reference is that in v. 8, the destruction of a fleet of Tarshish-ships by an east wind, an achievement which the v. ascribes to Yahweh.19 But that Tarshish-ships could have, at the very best, only the remotest connection with Jerusalem and its siege, is apparent at the first glance.20 That the vv. do not refer to the siege of Jerusalem by Senacherib is certain. That they do not even refer specifically to Jerusalem is, at the very least, exceedingly probable. And once both Jerusalem and Senacherib are removed from consideration, it becomes a simple matter to determine with practical certainty the specific event in history, with which the people of Judah were concerned, and of which the author of these few vv. might well have taken notice, to which this passage refers. It is to the destruction of a considerable portion of the Persian fleet of Xerxes just before the Battle of Artemisium in 480 B.C. This event Herodotus describes in the following terms:21 "The vessels of the fleet, after their arrival on the coast of Magnesia, . . . there stationed themselves, the foremost drawing close to land, the others lying on their anchors behind. As the shore was of no great extent, the fleet was ranged in eight regular divisions, with their heads towards the main sea, in which situa tion they passed the night. On the approach of day, the sky and the sea, which had before been serene, were violently disturbed : 19 A few scholars (Wellhausen, ' Ehrlich, Gunkel, Buttenwieser et al.), following the suggestion of some manuscripts, would emend ברוח to כרוח, interpret רוח as the subject of תשבר, and so render the v. "As the east wind breaks the Tarshish ships." But this not only compels the emendation of a text which is established by MT and all the versions, but also creates a simile which has no conclusion whatever, and which therefore remains hanging awkwardly and to the confusion of the meaning of the entire passage. As we will soon see, this emendation is entirely unjustified and actually destroys the true meaning of the v. 30 Therefore Sharpe (History of the Hebrew Nation, 131) prefers to see here an allusion to the destruction of the Tyrian vessels which were carrying sup plies to Senacherib at the siege of Pelusium (cf. Herod., II, 141) (quoted from Cheyne). " VII, 188, 190-191 (translated by Schmitzl.</page><page sequence="7">[7] PSALM 48 7 a furious storm arose, attended with a violent squall of wind from the east, which the inhabitants of these parts call an Helles pontian wind. They who foresaw that the tempest would still increase, and whose situation was favourable, prevented the effects of the storm, by drawing their vessels ashore, and with them preserved their own persons : of those whom the hurricane surprised farther out at sea, some were driven to the straits of Pelion, termed the Ipnoi; others went on shore: some were dashed against the promontory of Sepias, others carried to Meliboea and Casthanaea, so severe was the tempest. "In this storm, according to the lowest calculation, four hundred vessels were totally lost, with an infinite number of men, and a prodigious treasure. Aminocles, son of Cratinus, a Mag nesian, who had an estate near Sepias, reaped afterwards very considerable advantage from this tempest ; many vessels of gold and silver were thrown by the tides upon his lands; he became master of various Persian treasures and an immense quantity of gold .... The loss of the provision-transports and of the other smaller vessels was too great to be ascertained. The naval com manders, apprehending that the Thessalonians would avail themselves of this opportunity to attack them, intrenched them selves within a buttress made of the wrecks of the vessels. For three days the storm was unabated; .... on the fourth day the tempest ceased." Such is Herodotus' account of this storm and its effects. Modern scholars" seem to be agreed, and no doubt with ample justification, that, in his usual, characteristic manner, Herodotus has exaggerated not a little, and in particular neither his figures of the size of Xerxes' navy23 nor of the number of ships destroyed are to be trusted too implicitly. But that, as the result of this storm, Xerxes suffered a major disaster, there can be not the slightest doubt. Still less can there be any doubt that it is to just this partie ular event that vv. 5-8 of our Ps. refer. V. 8 in particular, "With 222222 Cf.

And, significantly, the v. ascribes this destruction to Yahweh. But not only the his torical import of v. 8, but equally that of v. 5, are now perfectly clear. There is no need whatever to emend עברו to חברו, as do Gunkel and Buhl, desperately seeking a reasonable historical setting for the passage, for the passage is plain in itself. The kings of this v. are, of course, the kings of the subject states which comprised the vast Persian Empire, many of whom were present in person in Xerxes' army, leading their own contingents of troops. The army had been assembled at Sardis, in Lydia, and there had passed the winter of 481/0 B.C. It is obviously to this that v. 5a refers. Early in the spring, so soon as weather conditions permitted, the army set out and very soon came to the Hellespont, which it crossed upon a bridge of boats, which had been prepared in advance. This was an engineering feat so remarkable that it is still regarded by historians as an outstanding achievement. That in its own day it must have been thought to border upon the marvelous, is beyond question. Patently it is to these events, the assembling of the kings at Sardis and the cross ing of the Hellespont soon thereafter, that v. 5 refers. Vv. 6-7, of course, describe, in graphic manner, the rapidly increasing terror and panic of the Persians, as the storm came upon them and its fury steadily increased, and the seeming hopelessness of their situation, at least as the author of these vv., either not fully conversant with all the historic details or else purposely exag gerating these for the glorification of Yahweh and also for his own personal satisfaction and that of his readers, represented it, grew steadily upon them. There can be scarcely any doubt that this destruction of Xerxes' fleet is the historic event to which these vv. refer. Therefore it is possible to date these vv. precisely. They must be practically coincident with the event which they describe.25 24 Interpreting תשבר as the second, sing, masc., referring to Yahweh; cf. note 19. 25 And therefore are, with possibly one exception soon to be considered, absolutely the earliest literary record of that event which we possess. The vv. reveal no knowledge whatever of the Battles of Salamis, Plataea and Mycale,</page><page sequence="9">[9] PSALM 48 News such as this travels fast. According to Munro,26 it was the Cilician fleet, one of the important contingents of Xerxes' navy, which felt the chief effects of this disaster. The report thereof would have spread quickly to Cilicia and from there to the Phoenicians, whose own ships constituted the largest and most important unit in the Persian fleet; and from there the word would have advanced quickly to Judaea. And manifestly it must have been good news for the Jews of Jerusalem and vicinity, for in it, it is self-evident, they saw the discomfiture of their great enemy and oppressor, Xerxes, and this too, as they interpreted it, at the hands of Yahweh Himself. Just why they should have so regarded Xerxes and therefore have received the news of the disaster which had befallen him and his navy with such manifest rejoicing, is an interesting and important story, but one into which we may not enter here. It is well to note too that the text of these four little verses is in absolutely perfect condition. Not a single letter need be changed. The verses are couched in a uniform 3/2 measure, as follows : to which, with his manifest exultation over the discomfiture of Xerxes and the Persian host, the author would undoubtedly have referred, had he been aware of them. In fact the w. make no mention of the Battle of Artemisium itself or of Thermopylae. Of course we have here only a small fragment of a poem, which, at the very least, certainly consisted of somewhat more than these four short verses. Not improbably this poem, in its original, full form, may have referred to these various battles of 480-479 B.C. But even granting this possibility, it seems reasonably assured that the poem was composed not later than 479 B.C., while actually 480 B.C. seems a still more precise and probable date. 26 Whose argument is, however, apparently based largely upon assumption and is not at all convincing. The only specific information which Herodotus gives concerning the national affiliations of the ships destroyed by the storm is that among theiti were twelve of the thirteen Paphian, i. e. Cyprian, vessels which were in Xerxes' fleet {ibid., 195). This record, however, is not without specific significance for our study. For it may be presumed that before the storm the thirteen Paphian vessels had been anchored close together. If there fore twelve of these thirteen vessels were lost in the storm, its extremely ravag ing effects are self-apparent, and it is a safe inference that the vast majority of the ships which were anchored too far out at sea to be drawn up on the mainland at the approach of the storm must have perished. The import of this inference will become apparent very soon.</page><page sequence="10">10 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [10] 5 כי־הנה המלכים נועדו / עברו יחדו 6 המה ראו כן־תמהו / נבהלו נחפזו 7 רעדה אחזתם שם / חיל כיולדה 8 ברוח קדים תשבר / ?2אניות תרשיש The metrical effect is excellent. Still another biblical passage seems to refer specifically to this same historical incident and so to confirm our interpretation of Ps. 48B.28 It is Ezek. 27. Scholars have long recognized that the chapter consists of two distinct strata. In what seems to be the original nucleus of this chapter, vv. l-3aa, 3b/3-8, 26-36,29 ז־ Note the interesting fact that here the caesura comes between the verb and its object, a somewhat unusual position, though by no means without parallel; cf. Ps. 78.38; 106.37 (here the caesura comes between the first and the second object of the verb) ; 110.5; 116.1 ; Lam. 2.2 (thrice), 8 (twice), 9, 14, 22c; 3.3, 5; Ezek. 27.33b (cf. below, p. 13). Very strangely Briggs, Peters and Buttenwieser regard Ps. 48.8 as an interpolation, no doubt only because of their inability to satisfactorily associate this account of the destruction of Tarshish ships by an east wind with any siege of Jerusalem. 28 As we will, from this point on, designate vv. 5-8, while the remainder of the Ps., w. 2-4, 9-15, we will designate as Ps. 48A. 2' Practically all modern scholars would include w. 9 and 25 in Ezek. 27A, but upon altogether insufficient grounds. V. 9 consists of two tristichs, couched in 3/2/2 meter, a metrical form which occurs occasionally in 27B, but which differs essentially from the 3/2 meter uniform in 27A, except perhaps for the last distich (cf. below, note 54). Moreover, after the climactic mention of the experts of Tyre as being the officers (cf. below, note 38) of the ship, in v. 8, it is certainly anti-climactic to have v. 9 refer to the elders of Byblos and its experts as being the caulkers of seams in the ship. Also the second tristich departs from the figure of the ship of state and employs instead as its basic figure the entire merchant-fleet of Tyre. Likewise the repetition in v. 9 of the words, וחכמיה היו בך, immediately after the same words in v. 8, is awkward and weakening and unworthy of the vigorous poem which 21 Pf is. Unquestionably v. 9 belongs to 27B, and may well have been suggested by the mention of the מחזקי בדקך in v. 27. V. 25 too is a double-distich, of which the first distich seems to be some what corrupt, and its original metrical form in consequence indeterminable. The second distich is in 3/2 meter, and, on the basis of this one consideration alone, it might well be included in 27A. However, the complete double distich seems to deal with the figure of the entire merchant-fleet of Tyre, rather than the single ship, and its emphasis is laid upon the wide-ranging commercial</page><page sequence="11">[11] psalm 48 11 Tyre is likened to a ship, a magnificent ship of state, while in the secondary, interpolated section, the figure of the ship is dis carded entirely, and Tyre is depicted as the great emporium of world-trade with its far-ranging merchant-fleet. Only the first section, which may be designated for convenience Ezek. 27A, has import for our present study. The text is fairly well preserved. With comparatively simple and minor emendations,30 based largely upon the versions, it may, with reasonable probability, be reconstructed as follows: ויהי דבר יהוה אלי לאמר: ואתה בךאדם שא על־צר קינה: ואמרת לצור l-3aa 3 את־אמרת (אניה)31 אני / כלילת יפיbβ 4 בלב ימים בנוף32/ כללו יפיך 5 ברושים משניר בנו־לך / את־כל33 לחתיך 34(ארז מלבנון לקחו / לעשות תרן־(לך activities of Tyre and its resultant wealth, just as in 27B, rather than upon the magnificent grandeur of the ship of state, as in 27A. For this reason it seems more reasonable to regard v. 25 as the climax and conclusion of 27B rather than as the continuation of the poem in 27A. It is not at all improbable that the interpolation of 27B, w. 9-25, into 27A, between w. 8 and 26 may have caused the loss of some part of the original poem; but at the most this could scarcely have been more than a few w. in extent. 30 For the majority of these emendations and the grounds for them, cf. the standard commentaries. In the following notes only those matters will be discussed in which our reconstruction or interpretation of the text differs from or goes beyond the conclusions of previous commentators. 31 Wellhausen seems to have been the first to propose the interpolation of אניה here. In this he has been followed by all subsequent scholars except Cooke. Seemingly, however, none of these scholars, not even Wellhausen himself, noticed that 5 here reads אני twice; and undoubtedly the first אני should have been vocalized ;;א, i. e. אנ,'ה. * 32 Bertholet would omit בניך and emend נבוליך to נדלוך ("they reared thee") to provide the necessary verb. But נדל never means "to build; to fashion," which is what the context here seems to require. Therefore it seems better to regard גבוליך as the gloss and retain בניך, but to emend it to בנוך (cf. v. 5 for the use of בנה to describe the general process of ship-building). 33 Reading כל in order to give the word a full beat, as the meter requires. 33 Since only one mast is spoken of, and that is all that ships at that time carried, it is better to retain ארז of MT than to emend to ארזים with the versions. And since עליך at the end of the v. must undoubtedly be linked with v. 6 and emended to עליני (so Bertholet), but a pronominal form as a dative of reference</page><page sequence="12">12 JULIAN MORGENSTERN עליני אלונים מבשן / עשו33 משוטיך קרשך שן36 בתאשרים / מאיי כתיים שש ברקמה ממצרים / היה מפרשך תכלה" מאיי אלישה / היה מכסך ישבי צידון וארור / היו שטים־לך חכמיך צור38 היו־בך / המה הבליך 26 במים רבים הביאוך / השטים אותך רוח הקדים שברך בלב ימים 27 »3מלחיך וחבליך ומחןקי°"־בדקך / וכל־אנשי מלחמתך יפלו בלב ימים / ביום מפלתך is still required, it is well to add לך. With the resultant תרן־לך cf. שטים-לך at the end of v. 8a. 35 We should probably vocalize משוטיך as in v. 29. Obviously oars of extra ordinary length are implied here, such as would be worthy of a ship of such magnificence. 36 Omit עשו for the sake of the meter. It is probably true that no ship's deck was ever made of ivory inlaid in wood of any kind. But that does not justify the omission of שן (Cooke), for, of course, we have here a hyperbolical picture of a ship of state of utmost magnificence. 3וארגמן ' must, of course, be omitted for the sake of the meter (Cooke). 38 The emendation of צור to צמר, first proposed by Kraetzschmar and ac cepted by Bertholet2 and Cooke, does not commend itself, for in such case all the Phoenician cities would be represented in the ship except Tyre itself. It is clear that the חבלים were not merely the pilots or helmsmen, but were actually the highest officers in the ship; so what more natural than that Tyrians them selves, i. e. their own experts in naval matters, should fill these posts? 39 V. 27 is obviously overloaded and, in its present text, cannot be cast in metrical form. It is self-evident that it contains some glosses. In all likelihood this glossation is the result of the interpolation of 27B into 27A. Presumably then the glosses are those terms which refer to the commercial activity and resultant wealth of Tyre, and so accord most closely with the thought of 27B. When we remove these terms, חונך ועזבוניך מערבך and וערבי מערבך and also אשר בך ובבל קהלך אשר בתוכך, what remains of the v. is completely unified in thought and accords precisely with our expectations of what the crew of such a ship of state would be, and likewise makes a perfect 3/2, 3/2 distich, such as we would expect. 4° מחזיקי must be emended to מחזיקי; for חזק בדק cf. 2 Ki. 12.6, 7.8, 9, 13; 22.5.</page><page sequence="13">PSALM 48 13 28 לקול זעקת חבליך / ירעשו 1י• 29 וירדו מאניותיהם / כל־תפשי משוט מלחים וכל« חבלים2•' / על־הארץ יעמדו 30 והשמיעו עליך בקולם / ויזעקו מרה ויעלו עפר על־ראשיהם / באפר יתפלשו» 31 והקריחו עליך קרחה / וחגרו שקים ובכו עליך במרי'י'־נפש / מספד מר 32 ונשאו עליך נהי5•־ / קינה יקוננו6•' מי כצור נדמתה» / בתוך הים 33 בצאת עזבוניך מימים / השבעת עמים8•■ ברב הונף" העשרת / מלכי ארץ 34 עת5° נשברת מימים / במעמקי מים מערבך וכל« קהלך / בתוכך נפלו •מגרשות 1י is certainly a corruption. It can be emended only by conjecture! a hazardous procedure. Ezek. 38.20 suggests an emendation to דני הים; but de spite the 'גר of מגרשות, corresponding to the 'דג of דני, this emendation here would seem far-fetched. Equally Ezek. 26.15 suggests the substitution of האיים for ־מגרשות, but this too would be no more than a guess. It seems best therefore to leave the space blank. 4' Just what חבלי הים would mean is not clear. Moreover, since מלחים is indeterminate, we would expect its correlated term to also be indeterminate; for these reasons emend to חבלים. Probably we should also read וכל. « For באפר יתפלשו cf.

It seems better to retain הוניך here, since מערבך occurs in v. 34b, but to emend to the sing. הונך; cf. w. 12, 27. 5° עת must, of course, be vocalized עת with G and V.</page><page sequence="14">14 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [14] 35 כל" ישבי האיים / שממו עליך ומלכיהם שערו שער51 / רעים פניהם52 36 סחרים בעמים שרקו עליך / בלהות53 היית ואינך עד־עולם"5 This may be rendered into English thus: 1 And the word of Yahweh came unto me saying: (2) Ο mortal one,55 compose over Tyre a dirge, (3aa) and say to Tyre: 3bj8 Thou didst say: I am a ship, of perfect beauty. 4 In the heart of the sea did they fashion thee; they made thy beauty perfect. s1 For שערו שער cf. Ezek. 32.10. s2 Accepting the emendation of Bertholet, based upon Neh. 2.2. G and S read דמעו; but it is doubtful whether דמעו can be used with פנים as the subject, in the sense, "to stream with tears;" rather it seems to mean only "to weep" and so to require a personal subject; cf. Jer. 13.17. Perhaps this should be read בלהות, as an abstract noun. However, it is by no means impossible to interpret the fem. plu. form, בלהות, of MT also as an abstract noun. 54 As the text stands in MT and is retained here, it constitutes a perfect 4/4 distich. However, there is absolutely no parallelism between the two stichoi, and their respective thoughts seem so utterly unrelated to each other that their arrangement as a distich seems suspicious; and this suspicion is strengthened by the sudden transition from the prevailing 3/2 meter to the 4/4. By the assumption that a single word has fallen out in each stichos the 3/2 meter would be continued to the very end of the poem. Therefore Kraetz• schmar would interpolate שפקו after בעמים, basing himself upon Job. 27.33. This is not impossible, but it is, of course, sheer conjecture. Actually the verb used most frequently with שרק to give the meaning implied in the context is שמם (cf. 1 Ki. 9.8; Jer. 19.8; 49.17; 50.13); and were it not that this verb has just been used in v. 35, it would be natural to supply it here. The second stichos is repeated verbatim in Ezek. 28.19, and this suggests that in both passages the text is in order and should be retained. On the other hand, Ezek. 26.21 suggests a possible basis of expansion, although of uncertain character. All in all, however, there is no urgent compulsion to emend or expand the v., and on the whole it seems best to retain the reading of MT and let the poem end, even though perhaps a bit awkwardly, in a rather poorly organized 4/4 distich. 5s בן אדם, literally, "son of man" or "human being," which, I assume, is the antithesis of בן אלהים, the putative sing, of בני אלד,ים or בני אלים, "the sons of God."

It is couched throughout in the 3/2 measure, the measure which, at least in post-exilic literature, seems to have become traditional for the kinah or dirge, with the exception of the final distich, which is in the longer and more stately 4/4 measure and forms a somewhat awkward but none the less dignified conclusion to the poem.58 As has been said, Tyre is here likened to a ship. But it is mani festly no ordinary ship. It is a ship of state, such as might fit tingly symbolize this powerful maritime monarchy. It is built and equipped with exceeding care, of the finest of materials brought from various lands. Its crew is recruited from the ablest sailors of the dependent Phoenician cities, while its officers and pilots are the experts from Tyre itself. But, venturing once upon the high seas, it meets its doom. An east wind shatters it, so that it sinks in deep waters, carrying its entire crew and all its rich treasure with it to the bottom of the sea. But here, probably unconsciously, the author departs somewhat from his basic figure. Suddenly, so it seems, Tyre is no longer likened to the single ship of state, which has just been sunk by the east wind. Rather it is for the moment thought of as a fleet of ships, a part of which has escaped the storm, and the crews of which have managed to land upon the seashore and thus save their lives. There they behold the fate of their less fortunate comrades in s6 Or, more literally and perhaps better, "have sunk (to the bottom of the sea)." 5' Literally, "and thy non-existence is unto eternity." s8 But cf. note 54.</page><page sequence="17">[17] psalm 48 17 the fleet. They mourn and wail for them with the traditional rites and, returning now to the original figure of the ship of state, they even utter a dirge for Tyre, so catastrophically destroyed. And then the author, speaking now apparently for himself, gloats at the thought that when the rich wares and treasure, which had filled the ship, rise to the surface and are cast ashore, so abundant are they that they enrich the various lands and their rulers. Such is the end of Tyre forever. It is significant that this account of the destruction of the Tyrian fleet by the storm coming from the east contains two important items which are not mentioned in Ps. 48B, viz. the record of the disembarking of the crews of a part of the fleet upon the land, where they behold the destruction of their less fortunate comrades, and the note that the treasure, which was cast ashore after the storm, was so abundant that peoples were greatly enriched by it. This agrees completely, though, of course, with a certain hyperbole of statement not at all surprising in a poem such as this, with Herodotus' account of this same inci dent, quoted in full above. This similarity of detail is so complete and striking that there cannot be the slightest doubt that Ezek. 27A, as well as Ps. 48B, refers to precisely the same event as does the passage from Herodotus. Nor is there any reason to question that Ezek. 27A, with all its vividness of detail, just as Ps. 48B, is practically contemporaneous with the event which it describes. It is significant that Ezek. 27A says specifically that it was the Tyrian fleet, or at least a considerable portion of it, which was destroyed by the storm. This too seems to be the implication of Ps. 48.8, with its reference to the "Tarshish ships." And inas much as these two records of this incident seem to be practically contemporaneous with the event, we may well question the cor rectness of Munro's conclusion that it was the Cilician, rather than the Tyrian, fleet, which experienced the direst effects of this destructive storm.59 55 Cf. above, note 26.</page><page sequence="18">18 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [18] In only one, but a very significant, respect does Ezek. 27A differ from Ps. 48B. There, apparently, it is the Persians who are the object of the Psalmist's hatred, and in whose discomfiture he exults so greatly, while in Ezek. 27A it is Tyre which plays this role for its author. This divergence is of more than passing significance and has its bearing upon the reconstruction of the history of this period. But this too is a matter into which we may not enter here. It suffices for our present purpose to have thus reconstructed and interpreted Ezek. 27A in the light of its obvi ous historical setting, to have coordinated it with the closely related account of the same incident in Ps. 48B, and thus to have found very strong confirmation of our interpretation of that passage.60 Ill Vv. 2-4, 9-15 (Ps. 48A) In significant contrast to the perfect condition of the text of Ps. 48B is the inescapable necessity of emendation, and even of some reorganization, of the text of A. Following a suggestion of Eissfeldt,61 who, in turn, developed a hint given by Mowinckel, we would reconstruct the text of A as follows : 40 In one additional respect this interpretation of Ezek. 27A is of deep significance. It fixes the date of this passage definitively as following soon after 480 B.C., while 27B must, of course, come from a period somewhat, and perhaps even considerably, later. The dating of Ezek. 27A in 480 B.C. or very shortly thereafter gives us, in turn, a firm starting-point in the impor tant task of determining the date of that entire section of Ezek., chapters 25.1 36.15, the denunciations of the neighboring nations. In another study I shall endeavor to establish, upon the basis of evidence quite as convincing as that presented here for 27A, that Ezek. 28 must also come from this very same period, about 480 B.C., and that the king of Tyre, who is there denounced and derided, was the very king who was ruling over Tyre in 485 B.C. and in the years immediately thereafter. This matter is of great significance for the reconstruction of the history of the Jewish people during that very momen tous and critical period. 41 Baal Zaphon, Zeus Cassios und der Durchzug der Israeliten durchs Meer, 15, note 2.</page><page sequence="19">L19JL19J psalm 48 1Ç 2 גדול יהוה ומהלל מאד / בעיר אלהינו62 4/3 3 הר קדשו65 יפה נוף&gt;6 / משוש כל65 הארץ 4/3 הר ציון ירכתי צפון / קרית מלך רב66 4/3 4+9b אלהים בארמנותיה נודע למשגב /67אלהים יכוננה עד־עולם 4/3 62 V. 2a is practically identical with Ps. 96.4a. There is accordingly no justification for omitting יהוה, as do Briggs et al. As suggested by Eissfeldt, some word, which stood in the construct relation with בעיר, may well have fallen out; v. 2b would mean therefore, "in the city of... is our God." The missing word may have been הצדק (cf. Isa. 1.26) or האטת (cf. Zech. 8.3) or some comparable term. Buhl would omit יהוה and read בעירו. However, an alternative hypothesis suggests itself. Inasmuch as v. 2b is practically iden tical with v. 9a/3 as emended (cf. below), it is not impossible that Ps. 96.4b, or something very similar, may have stood originally in this place, and then was lost for some reason, and after this the present v. 2b crept in as a ditto graph of v. 9a/3 to fill the gap thus created. 63 Briggs, Kent, Bertholet, Mowinckel, Buhl et al. link הר קדשו of v. 2 with what follows in v. 3. 64 Gunkel would emend יפה נוף to יפת נפות, which he renders "the most beautiful of hills." This emendation is, however, rather extreme and quite unnecessary. He likewise transposes בעיר אלהינו from v. 2, omits 'ב and makes עיר אלהינו the subject to יפת נפות. 65 Reading צל rather than כל־ and thus giving the word a full beat for the sake of emphasis and also to preserve the regular 4/3 meter of this section of the Ps. 66 Briggs would transpose רב from the end of v. 3 to the beginning of v. 4, regard it as a verb, and so translate, "Yahweh (reading יהוה for אלהיט, as do also Baethgen, Mowinckel and Gunkel) doth strive in her citadels." קרית מלך then, in v. 3, he translates, "a royal city," and makes it the predicate to .הר ציון 67 Following Eissfeldt {op. cit.) in transferring v. 9b to this place, to com plete the parallelism with v. 4 and also to provide the appropriate second stichos to this distich, and likewise to remove it from its present unbalancing and illogical position as a third stichos to a distich already complete in both thought and form. Because of these considerations Bertholet would omit v. 9b altogether. On the other hand, Mowinckel {op. cit., 62, 126) apparently regards סלה as a substitute for a longer clause, ולא תמוט עדי־עד, or something quite similar, which, if actually original, would make a perfectly balanced distich with the present v. 9b; but this emendation is obviously forced. All in all the present rearrangement seems the most reasonable and probable. More over, with w. 5-8 regarded as an interpolation, this transfer involves a com paratively minor and easy shift, in the range of only one verse. In all likeli hood therefore the transposition of v. 9b from its original position after v. 4 took place either before, or else because of, the interpolation of w. 5-8.

Kittel omits צבאות; Kent omits בעיר אלהינו; Peters, Buhl and Mowinckel omit בעיר יהוה צבאות; Briggs omits the entire clause. Gunkel transposes בעיר אלהינו and בעיר יהוה צבאות. The reading here proposed is unquestionably the simplest and most probable, since it omits only the altogether superfluous צבאות and the redundant בעיר, and also restores perfectly the metrical form of the distich. 6' Duhm, Baethgen, Briggs, Kent and Gunkel emend □אלתי to יהוה. 70 There is no need whatever to emend כשמך to בשמעך, as proposed by Gunkel, or to שמיך?, as proposed by Ehrlich and Perles. Such emendation, as we will soon see, implies complete failure to comprehend in its proper historical setting the very significant thought here expressed. 71 With the vast majority of scholars emending על to the quite obvious עד. 72 Briggs was apparently the first to regard ישמח הר ציון as the second stichos in the distich with צדק מלאה ימינך of v. lib. With this rearrangement a most effective chiasm thus becomes apparent in the two parallel distichs. Kent, Staerk, Kittel, Bertholet, Gunkel, Mowinckel and Buhl have approved this rearrangement. 73 The sing., משפטך, instead of the present plu., to complete the obvious parallelism with צדק. 74 Of course reading לחילה with practically all commentators. 75 Reading קדו?, with Graetz, Cheyne, Wellhausen, Peters, Kittel, and Mowinckel. Duhm and Bertholet emend, more simply, to פסעו, which, on the basis of the Aramaic פסע, they render "durchschreitet," while Baethgen, followed by Gunkel and Kônig, retains פסגו, which, he contends, is the Hebrew equivalent of the Aramaic פסעו, and which he therefore likewise renders "durchschreitet." Briggs and Kent emend to הפלו, which they render, rather artificially, "distinguish." Manifestly the emendation to קדו?, while not the least in extent, offers the best parallelism to שיתו לבכם. 76 Buhl would omit למען and read ותספרו, for the sake of the meter; but this is quite unnecessary, since למען, as a conjunction, can be read without a beat, if this be called for. 77 Emending אלהיס to יהוה, as in v. 2, with Baethgen, Gunkel and Buhl. 78 Slightly rearranging the final stichos of the tristich into what seems its most effective form. Cheyne, Wellhausen, Duhm, Staerk, Peters, Kittel,</page><page sequence="21">[21] psalm 48 21 It will be seen that, with this reorganization of the text, A begins with four" 4/3 distichs, continues then with one 3/3 and six 3 ]2 distichs and concludes, very appropriately and effectively and in a manner which is quite common, with a 3/3/3 tristich. The obvious symmetry of this metrical rearrangement, as well as the more apparent parallelism of the members within the various distichs, and likewise the effective chiastic form of vv. 1 lb—12, as thus formulated, may well be regarded as very strong con firmation of the correctness of this reorganization of the text of A. This may be rendered as follows: Great is Yahweh and greatly to be praised; In the city of is our God.80 Of majestic elevation is His holy mount, Joy of the entire earth; Mount Zion is yarkete Safon, Citadel of the mighty King. In her palaces God is recognized as a tower of strength ;818־a Bertholet, Mowinckel and Buttenwieser omit על־מות. Graetz, Gunkel and Buhl emend to על־עלמות, which they interpret as "after the Elamite (mode)," and which they likewise regard as the beginning of Ps. 49. Ehrlich, following G, reads as one word, עולמות, "eternity." Kônig, with his characteristic eagerness to retain MT, translates mechanically and in seeming defiance of all meaning, "trotz des Sterbens." Briggs, followed by Kent, regards all of v. 15b, missing in G, as a gloss. Furthermore, Ehrlich would emend אלהיט to ינהלנו in order to secure what seems to him a worthy and desirable parallelism to ינהננו. For the interpretation of Johnson, cf. above. 'י Or if in v. 9a we give כן a full beat, as is quite possible, and as had to be done with כאשר, then five 4/3 distichs and no 3/3's. 80 But cf. note 62. 81 Buttenwieser's translation. However, a rendering of צדק by some such term as "justification" would bring out better the chiastic parallelism with משפטך in the next distich. 82 Presumably this is the meaning of נודע למשגב. Actually 'נודע ל invariably means "to be or become or make oneself known to somebody," for in every other case in biblical literature in this expression the preposition is followed by a noun or pronoun designating a person and not a thing. Actually therefore the expression, נודע למשגב, is unique, and there can accordingly be no good reason for not translating it as we have, and as it is translated by practically all scholars.</page><page sequence="22">22 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [22] 9b May God establish her forever. 9a Even as we have heard, so do we behold83 The city of Yahweh, our God. 10 We are mindful of Thy faithfulness, 0 God, Within Thy Temple.84 11 Even as Thy name, so also Thy praise (Doth reach) to the ends of the earth. 12 Thy right hand is bounteous81 in truth; Let Mount Zion rejoice: Let the maidens of Judah exult Because of Thy justice. 13 Go round about Zion and make the circuit of her; Enumerate85 her towers; 14a Take note of her wall; Give heed to her palaces; 14b-15 That you may relate to the very last generation86 8ראה נ is used not infrequently with the preposition 'ב instead of with the direct object (compare Gen. 29.32; 1 Sam. 1.11; 2 Sam. 16.12 with Gen. 31.42; Ex. 3.7; 4.31; 2 Ki. 14.26; Ps. 31.8) and apparently when the precise thought implied is "to look at, to watch, to gaze at fixedly or for a long time, to survey, to examine, to take careful note of;" cf. Gen. 21.16; 34.1 ; Ex. 2.11 ; 1 Sam. 6.19; Isa. 66.24; Ezek. 21.26; Ps. 22.18; 113.6; Eccles. 3.22; 2 Chron. 7.3. From this it is but a short step to the connotations, "to behold, to experience (good or evil);" Num. 11.15; Jer. 29.32; Ps. 27.13; 106.5. And it is only a slight step further to the meaning, "to look upon in triumph;" Ps. 112.8; 118.7. Here obviously the meaning, is the quite simple "to behold, to look at carefully and, impliedly, for much more than a momentary glance, and likewise with the feeling of gladness and exultation." There is therefore not the slightest need or justification for emending בעיר to עיר. In fact the use of the verb with the preposition is most effective, in that it suggests the mood of the eager pilgrims, as at last they behold for the first time the sacred city, of which they had heard such glowing tales, and gaze at it fixedly and find that this examination confirms all that they had heard. 84 It is not quite clear whether בקרב היכלך modifies דמינו or חסדך. More probably it modifies the latter; but in either case the precise implication of the v. is somewhat obscure. 85 פקדו here would have the meaning, "count, enumerate, impress upon the memory," so that later it may be related, etc. 86 להור אחרון, not "to a later generation," but "to the very last generation;"</page><page sequence="23">[23] psalm 48 23 That this very Yahweh87 is our God; He (it is who) will forever guide us (upon our pilgrim age).88 The first step in the interpretation of this Ps. is to determine the date of its composition and also its historical background. Various bits of evidence within the Ps. enable us to fix its date with remarkable precision. The first fact to be noted is that the Ps. depicts Jerusalem as a city of dignity and beauty, with a wall, with palaces and towers, and, above all else, with the Temple standing.8' Moreover, the Ps. breathes a spirit of quiet confidence and security. There is a deep conviction that the city and the people enjoy Yahweh's favor, that all is well with it and that its future is assured. There is no occasion for worry or for questioning Yahweh's power or His benevolent intentions towards His city and nation. These conditions might perhaps fit certain moments in the pre-exilic period of Judah's history, particularly the thirteen years period of the reign of Josiah, between the Deuteronomic Reformation and his death at the Battle of Megiddo. Or it might seem to fit the latter portion of the reign of Solomon, or the period of Judah's military and commercial expansion under Uzziah.90 But second thought compels the ruling out of the reign of Solomon com pletely; for certainly in that early day, immediately after its erection, the Temple had not yet come to play the role here ascribed to it, nor was it the object of popular admiration and cf. Ex. 4.8; Isa. 44.6; 48.12; Job. 19.25; Neh. 8.18; Isa. 30.8; Gen. 49.1; Isa. 2.2, Mic. 4.1 and passim. 8י For the position of זה preceding the noun which it modifies cf. Gesenius, Handwôrterbuch1!,Handworterbuch^, 193a. 88 נהג, "to lead, to guide," as a shepherd or guide, who leads his flock or company in safety through all the dangers of the journey, provides for all their needs, guards them against all that threatens and brings them at last in security to their destination. Inasmuch as, as we will see, this is a pilgrim Ps., we may justifiably interpret 'נהגנו, "He will guide us" upon our recurring pilgrimages hither to the Temple, and likewise upon our entire pilgrimage through life. 8« Vv. 4, 10, 13, 14. »« Cf. "Amos Studies, III," HUCA, XV (1940), 267-274.</page><page sequence="24">2424 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [24] religious passion as here depicted.91 And second thought too raises the question whether the closing portion of the reign of Josiah, when, nominally at least, Judah was still in a state of vassalage to the Assyrian Empire, rapidly decaying though the latter's power and dominion were, can furnish the proper his torical setting for the conditions and even more for the spirit of obvious satisfaction with the present state of the people and of quiet confidence in its future, which this Ps. expresses. Perhaps then of the entire pre-exilic period the reign of Uzziah might seem to furnish the most plausible background for this Ps. Undoubtedly it was an age of national strength, achievement and confident self-consciousness.92 But it was an age likewise of the detailed incidents and character of which we know all too little, and an age too which was unquestionably dominated by the figure of the king himself. It is almost inconceivable then that a Ps. composed in this period would not have made unmistakable and specific reference to the king; and this Ps. manifests not the faintest regard for or knowledge of the existence of a king over Judah, whether Uzziah or any of his predecessors or successors.93 Actually then no one moment or age in the entire pre-exilic period seems to be altogether suitable as the background of this PS.9« If then we turn to the post-exilic period and seek there an adequate historical setting for the Ps., our choice is limited imme diately, by the references in the Ps. to the existence of the Temple and of palaces within and a wall around the city, to two periods, either the period following immediately upon the completion and dedication of the second Temple, in 516 B.C., and continuing 1י For the attitude of suspicion and hostility on the part of the great mass of the people towards the Temple in the first half century or more after its erection, cf. ibid, 103-124. 9־ Cf. ibid, 259-277. ג' "The great King" of v. 3 is, as will soon be made clear, Yahweh Him self. 94 And this doubly so after having established that vv. 5-8, formerly linked so generally with the reign of Hezekiah and the experiences of 701 B C., are not an original and integral part of the Ps. proper.</page><page sequence="25">[25] psalm 48 25 until 485 B.C.,95 or following upon the rebuilding of the walls by Nehemiah in 444 B.C. And at very first glance it becomes apparent that the latter period does not lend itself well to this purpose; for while it is true that the wall of Jerusalem was re built by Nehemiah, his own statements testify that even for some time after that Jerusalem continued in a ruinous and depop ulated condition and that people had to be conscripted from all sections of the province of Judaea to repopulate the devastated city. Moreover, the economic circumstances as well as the spirit of the people of Judah, during and for quite some time after the period of Nehemiah, were the very antitheses of those which would make possible the note of national satisfaction, jubilation and confidence which this Ps. voices. If then we would assign the Ps. to a period following Nehemiah, we would have to assign it, as do Duhm and others, to a period well into the Hellenistic age. There seems little justification for such a procedure, and many considerations speak strongly against it. This leaves only the brief period, 516-485 B.C., and more specifically about 500 B.C.,96 open for consideration as the most probable moment for the composition of this Ps. But many and significant considerations, in addition to the fact that the Temple was certainly standing at this time and was enjoying the high and even eager and passionate regard of the vast majority of the population, not merely of Judaea proper, but certainly likewise of Galilee,97 and quite probably of Samaria as well, furnish strong confirmation that this Ps. was composed at just this time. There »5 The basis for what is here an altogether arbitrary statement, viz. that a crushing calamity befell the little Jewish community in 485 B.C. and marked the beginning of a new era in its life and thought, will be established conclusively in another work, to appear later. 6י Since we must allow for the lapse of a reasonable number of years after 516 B.C. for the conditions and procedures depicted in the Ps. to have evolved On the other hand, as we will show in the work referred to in the preceding note, by 490 B.C., if not even a year or two earlier, thoughts and hopes of restoration as a political nation under a Davidic king had begun to evolve under changing circumstances of history, which would have precluded almost entirely the expression of ideas and an outlook such as are voiced in this Ps. " Cf. Finkelstein, The Pharisees, index, under Galilee.</page><page sequence="26">26 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [26] are, in the first place, cogent reasons, for believing that at just this time not only was the Temple standing, but also that Jeru salem had been restored to the state of a truly imposing city, with palaces, towers and a wall, precisely as this Ps. records. IV • "For His Name's Sake' In this connection the thought of v. 11a is of deep significance. As has been said, the real implication of this v. seems not to have been appreciated by commentators, especially those who would emend the v. in any way.98 The v. says unmistakably that not only Yahweh's name, i. e. His reputation, but likewise the praise of Him reaches to the very ends of the earth. This is an expression of universalism which would have been incon ceivable in Israel before Ezekiel. But it voices simply and directly a doctrine which was first formulated by that prophet and which played a role of tremendous significance in the subsequent evo lution of Judaism, and particularly in the century or more following immediately upon its formulation by Ezekiel in his very last years. The implications of this doctrine can be stated succinctly. In the period intervening between the first and second captures of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, in 597 and 586 B.C., Jeremiah rejected the doctrine of the assured doom of the nation at the hands of Yahweh as proper and justified punish ment for its faithlessness and iniquity, which he himself in his youth, as well as the great prophets who preceded him, had proclaimed so assiduously and with complete conviction. In its stead he announced a new doctrine, viz. that Jerusalem must fall, the Temple be destroyed and the people go into exile; but the exile, with all its suffering, was to be, not for destruction, but for discipline, correction and regeneration; and when at last, after seventy years, the people would have become truly regen erate and would have returned to Yahweh with full heart and 58 Gunkel, Ehrlich, Perles; cf. above, note 70.</page><page sequence="27">[27] psalm 48 27 soul, then Yahweh, in turn, would forgive their sins and would take them again unto Himself as His people and would restore them to their land and to national existence.59 This was the doctrine of "the new covenant."100 Quite manifestly Jeremiah believed firmly that at least that section of the nation which had been carried into exile,101 there to undergo the experiences of discipline and regeneration through suffering, would return to Yahweh whole-heartedly and with complete and enduring conviction and, having learned at last the error of its way, would henceforth live with Yahweh in perfect relations and would therefore never sin again. Accord ingly there would never again be occasion for Yahweh to punish Israel, as He had during the exile, or to repudiate this new covenant. Therefore this would be an eternal covenant. Probably Jeremiah died too soon after the promulgation of this doctrine to learn how grievously he was mistaken in his 99 Jer. 25.11-14; 29.10-14; although these passages are probably not from Jeremiah himself, they were undoubtedly composed during the exile, perhaps during the latter portion thereof, and were based upon Jeremiah's prediction of an eventual return from exile under Yahweh's grace. That they were gener ally current, at least among certain sections of the people, around 516 B.C. is convincingly attested by Zech. 1.12-17; 7.5. In all likelihood it was the then generally current belief that the exile would endure for seventy years which suggested to the Persians the program of completing and dedicating the second Temple, and with this the reorganization of Israel as a theocracy instead of as a political nation, just in 516 B.C., precisely seventy years after the second deportation by Nebuchadrezzar in 586 B.C.; cf. "A Chapter in the History of the High-Priesthood," AJSL, LV (1938), 184 ff. 100 Jer. 31.30-33. This passage was long regarded by such eminent biblical scholars as Movers, DeWette, Hitzig, Stade, Smend and Duhm as not the utterance of Jeremiah, but rather the work of a late exilic or, and more proba bly, a post-exilic writer. Their argument has, however, been convincingly refuted and the Jeremianic authorship of the passage valiantly defended by Cornill, and in this conclusion he has been followed by Giesebrecht and Volz. Actually the vision of the two baskets of figs, in Jer. 24, the Jeremianic author ship of which is conceded by practically all biblical scholars, with its promise of the restoration of the regenerate exiles in Babylon, would be utterly incom prehensible if the concept of the new covenant did not underlie it. Accordingly, if Jer. 24 be recognized as Jeremianic, then all the more must 31.31-34 be likewise so recognized. Jer. 24; 29.16-19.</page><page sequence="28">28 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [28J expectations. But subsequent history, even in the years follow ing immediately upon the fall of Jerusalem and the death of Jeremiah shortly thereafter,102 demonstrated speedily and con vincingly that the bitter experiences of expatriation and exile did not necessarily make for regeneration and return to Yahweh on the part of the surviving Jewish community, not even the portion thereof which lived in exile in Babylonia, upon which Jeremiah had rested all his hopes. On the contrary, both in Babylonia and in Palestine, so it seemed on the surface, after the first bitter experiences of conquest and readjustment had been lived through, the people continued in the former even tenor of their ways, marked by faithlessness to Yahweh and a consequent disregard of His revealed way of life, measured by prophetic standards, with resultant sinfulness, quite the opposite to the line of conduct which Jeremiah had so confidently expected. This fact was readily apparent. But despite this, somehow or other the doctrine of Jeremiah persisted, that the exile was not to be for national doom and destruction, that in due time and despite its persistent sinfulness Yahweh would restore captive Israel to its land and to national existence and take it again as His people. Accordingly Deutero Isaiah could proclaim103 that Israel in exile had already suffered, not merely in proper measure, but even two-fold, at the hand of Yahweh for all its iniquities, and so had made full compensation therefore, and had been purged thereof and restored to divine favor; therefore the moment of its restoration to its native land was now drawing near. Therefore, so general opinion took form even before Deutero-Isaiah, all Israel had to do, and particularly Israel in exile, was to wait and hope and, through the develop ment and practice of rites and institutions of separatistic and particularistic character, such as the Sabbath, dietary laws, cir cumcision, abstention from intermarriage and the like, preserve its national consciousness and identity, so that it might be ready for this national restoration, whenever it would come. Unquestionably this expectation took root deeply and speedily 101 In all likelihood in exile in Egypt; cf. Jer. 43.6f. 40.2 ג"; cf. below, note 122.</page><page sequence="29">[29] psalm 48 29 and was cherished generally, and by the Babylonian Jewish com munity in particular. However, a paradox was inherent in this expectation, unper ceived and unheeded by the people in general, but readily apparent to those thinkers who could search beneath the surface, thinkers such as Ezekiel was. The paradox was this; how was it possible to reconcile the concept of Yahweh as a God of complete and perfect justice and righteousness in His dealings with men, and particularly with Israel, His people, with the quite antithetical concept of His complete forgiveness of His people, still recognizedly and confessedly sinful and faithless? This problem, so apparent to deeply religious souls, troubled not only Ezekiel, but also subsequent thinkers and molders of the religious thought and doctrine of Judaism in the century which followed the exile; and, speaking broadly, four separate answers were given to it, the first by Ezekiel, the second by Deutero-Deutero-Isaiah, the third by a group of zealous nationalists in the period about 490 B.C., and the fourth by Priestly legislators at some time during the fourth century B.C. For the inter pretation of Ps. 48 it is necessary to consider only the solution of the problem proposed by Ezekiel. His answer was the doctrine of "for His name's sake."104 It is formulated most clearly in Ezek. 36, though it is occasionally referred to by the prophet elsewhere in his ■book.105 Undoubtedly 104 למען שסו ; in origin at least anything but the conventional and half meaningless phrase, which it tended to become in time, and as which, judging by their seeming failure to interpret it adequately in their expositions of Ezekiel and other biblical writings where it occurs, commentators have apparently regarded it; cf. "Moses with the Shining Face," HUCA, II (1925), 18-20. 105 Ezek. 20.9, 22,44; 39.7,23-29. The phrase occurs also in Jer. 14.7 and 21. In V. 7, however, G read apparently למענך for למען שמך of MT, and this reading has been accepted by Duhm and Cornill. In v. 21, on the other hand, the reading of MT is attested by the versions, and this, in turn, would seem to give preference to the reading of MT in v. 7 also. Accordingly if these vv. be actually from Jeremiah, we would have here a use of the technical phrase, למען שסו, and an affirmation of the doctrine implicit therein earlier even than Ezekiel, and would therefore have to deny that prophet the credit for invent ing it and for the original formulation of the significant doctrine which the phrase implies. Of all modern biblical scholars only Duhm and Stade question</page><page sequence="30">30 JULIAN MOKGENSTERN [30] it was conceived and formulated by him in his later years, after the people had been in exile in Babylonia sufficiently long to demonstrate convincingly that Jeremiah's expectations of their regeneration were not to be realized. Basic to the doctrine is the Jeremian authorship of these two w. and of the passages, w. 7-9 and 19-22, of which they are an integral part, and this too only half-heartedly and without complete conviction. Duhm even suggests that w. 19-22 may be from a different and a later hand than vv. 7-9. Giesebrecht too seems a bit uncertain of the authorship, but in the end ascribes both passages to Jeremiah. Cornill suggests that vv. 19-22 were once the immediate continuation of w. 7-9. Various considerations, however, point indisputably and convincingly to the conclusion that both passages, w. 7-9 and 19-22, cannot be the work of Jeremiah. The concept expressed in v. 9, that Yahweh was in the midst of Israel, occurs also in Ex. 17.7; Num. 14.14; Deut. 7.21; 31.17; Isa. 12.6; Mic. 3.11; Zeph. 3.15, 17, all late, and probably post-exilic, passages, with the possibly single exception of Mic. 3.11. Similarly the concept implicit in the clause, ושמך עלינו נקרא, of v. 9 seems to be post-exilic. The expression occurs in eight other passages in Jer. (7.10, 11, 14, 30; 15.16; 25.29; 32.34; 34.15), but in every instance seems to be editorial. The idea underlying the clause is more readily comprehensible after Ezekiel's formulation of the doctrine of "for His name's sake" than if it preceded the formulation of this doctrine (cf. Isa. 63.19; Dan. 9.18-19). Moreover, the throne of Yahweh, mentioned in v. 21, is referred to again in Jer. only in 3.17; 17.12. In both passages it connotes Jerusalem, and presumably so here also; but the specific connection of Jerusalem with the main theme of the chapter, the devastating drought, affecting the entire country, is difficult to determine. Also both 3.17 and 17.12 are interpolations; and this same conclusion would apply here. The two passages voice Israel's frantic pleading with Yahweh to forgive its sins, sins which it readily acknowledges, to forgive them, even though Israel does not merit forgiveness, but only divine wrath and punishment, and to forgive them because of some weighty consideration implicit in the phrase, למען שמך. Impliedly the consideration inherent in the phrase has a compelling force with Yahweh. But inasmuch as Jeremiah, in the first three quarters of his prophetic ministry, proclaimed unqualifiedly that Yahweh must inavertibly punish Israel for its sins, and must even cast it off to its destruction, this doctrine here contradicts Jeremiah's teaching, and so cannot possibly have been uttered by him as his own personal thought. As Volz has seen, it can at the best represent only the prophet's repetition of the people's argument and appeal, in order to show how invalid and futile these are. But several considéra tionstions argue against this ingenious hypothesis. Vv. 11 ff. seem to imply that vv. 7-9 were uttered by Jeremiah himself as an appeal to Yahweh on behalf of the people; but such an appeal Jeremiah could never have uttered. In the second place, is it possible that the doctrine of "for His name's sake" could have been a popular belief in Jeremiah's day, which, however, Jeremiah him</page><page sequence="31">[31] psalm 48 31 the principle that Yahweh is indeed a universal God, whose power and authority extend throughout the world and over all nations. Moreover, the fundamental desire of Yahweh is that this fact of His universal godhead and dominion be recognized self rejected? And if this doctrine had been popularly current in Jeremiah's day, then how would it have been possible, or what need would there have been, for Jeremiah to subsequently formulate his doctrine of the new covenant, or for this doctrine to have been formulated at all by Jeremiah, since it is the manifest and indispensable precursor of the doctrine of "for His Name's sake?" And is it conceivable that, after this popular doctrine had been rejected by Jeremiah, some thirty years later Ezekiel should have reaffirmed it and ex panded its content? And if this doctrine had been popular some thirty years earlier, how can we account for Ezekiel's formulation of it, with a clear state ment of all its implications, with all the earmarks of freshness and originality, quite as if it was something entirely new with him? Is it possible to conceive of the formulation and popular acceptance of the doctrine of "for His name's sake" before Jeremiah had first formulated his doctrine of the new covenant, and even before the weaknesses and fallacies of this doctrine had begun to become apparent? All these cogent considerations seem to suggest that Jer. 14.7-9 and 19-21 must be post-Ezekelian interpolations, just as are Ex. 32.11-12 and Num. 14.13-20, in which likewise the doctrine of "for His name's sake" finds vigorous and illuminating expression. And while it has nothing to do immediately with our main theme, and so may lead us somewhat far afield, it may not be amiss to consider Jer. 14.7-9, 19-21 with regard to their poetic structure. It seems not at all improbable that the two passages once constituted a single poem, or rather a fragment of a single poem; but if so, then vv. 19-21 undoubtedly preceded vv. 7-9 thus: 19 המאס מאסת את־יהודה / אכ-בציון נעלה נפשך 3/3 מדוע-הכיתנו ואין-לנו מרפא / "קוה לשלום ואין-טוב / ולעת מרפא והנה-בעתה 3/3/3 20 ידענו יהוה רשענו/ 6כי חטאנו לך 3/3 21 אל-תנאץ למען שמך / אל-"תחבל כסא כבודך / 4אל-תפר בריתך אתנו 3/3/3 7 אס-עונינו ענו בנו® / עשה למען שמך / כי-רבו משובתינו לך-חטאנו 3/3/3 8 מקוה ישראל י'יהוה / מושיעו בעת צרה 3/3 למה-תהיה 'כנר בארץ / ובארה נטה ללו! 3/3 9 למה-חהיה כאיש נדהם / כגבור לא־יוכל 8להושע 3/3 ואתה בקרבנו יהוה / ושמך עלינו נקרא / אל תניחנו 3/3/2 (a.

This desire on Yahweh's part has manifestly come to transcend even His desire for the re pentance and regeneration of His people, Israel, and their return to Him, purged of their inclination to sin and faithlessness, and their justified restoration as His people because of this discipline and regeneration. Nor does He desire merely the recognition by all the nations of His universal godhead and authority over them, but likewise He desires, and even demands, a certain measure of homage from them, homage perhaps which is not quite comparable to that which is implicit in the worship of Him by His people, Israel, but homage in some degree none the less. But this homage is not being accorded to Him by the nations. And in truth how and by what right can He really expect it to be accorded to Him; for, beholding the sad fate of His people, thought expressed by לך is significant, it too receives a full beat; "Verily, against Thee have we sinned." c.

This passage has marked affinities in thought with Isa. 59.1-15, certainly a post-exilic utterance. Both passages affirm that because of Israel's sins Yahweh has repudiated, or at least suspended, His covenant relations with it and therefore, for the present at least, is not functioning in its behalf. How ever, the two passages differ in this, that apparently Isa. 59.1-15 knows no thing of, or else completely ignores, the doctrine of "for His name's sake," while Jer. 14.19-21, 7-9 recognizes it as a doctrine of major importance. The two passages cannot therefore be from the same author, and perhaps not even from quite the same age. But they are significant in that they give expression to a prophetic theme heard but seldom after the exile, that Israel had been a a very sinful people, and therefore its present situation is but its well-deserved punishment at Yahweh's hands. Further indication of the post-exilic author ship of both these passages may be seen in the fact that the record of Israel's sin is here a confession of guilt by the people and not a denunciation thereof by the prophet, as was characteristic of pre-exilic prophecy. But all this is further and compelling evidence that Jer. 14.7-9, 19-21 cannot be from Jere miah himself, must be an interpolation into their present setting, and must accordingly have been composed later than Ezekiel's formulation of the doc trine of "for His name's sake."</page><page sequence="33">[33] psalm 48 33 Israel, particularly that important section which was in exile, and reasoning from this circumstance in a manner altogether natural and logical for the nations at large, what must they think of Him and of His world-power? Must they not look upon Him as a deity altogether impotent? How can a god, who can not protect even his own little people and preserve them in their national existence in their own land and prosper them in their dealings with other nations, as any competent and self-respecting god should, how can such a god claim to be universal, and that his authority extends over nations other than his own, even over all the nations of the earth? Such a claim can have no substance, is preposterous, and could not but be rejected by those very nations by whom Yahweh desires most of all that this doctrine, with its consequences of recognition of and homage to Him, should be accepted unquestioningly. Therefore, would Yahweh win their recognition and homage, one step is indispensable and imperative before all else. Even though Israel is still a faithless people, steeped in sin, and even though this fact is clearly known both to Him and to it, and even though it has not become regenerate in any way, nor in the slight est degree of its own accord merited forgiveness, none the less Yahweh must forgive it and restore it to its land and to national existence and take it again as His people and prosper it in the sight of all the nations, in order that their suspicions may be dispelled and they may come to realize that He is indeed a great and powerful deity, a world-god in every respect, that not only can He protect and prosper His own particular, little people, but likewise He can work judgments and execute punishments throughout the world, upon those nations which will not recog nize Him and His power and dominion and will not do homage to Him and revere His holy name. For the sake of His name, for the sake of His reputation among the nations, He must act. He must of His own volition, as a manifestation of sheer grace, forgive Israel all its sins and take it again unto Himself as His people. But since it is inconceivable that a God, just and pure, as Yahweh is, can associate Himself in permanent and benevolent relations with a people impure, faithless and sinful, a people</page><page sequence="34">34 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [34] which, regardless of its manifold obligations to Him, stubbornly follows the evil inclinations of its heart, then, in addition to all else, Yahweh must Himself purify this people and Himself purge it of all further inclination to sin. He must remove the heart of stone from its bosom, that stony heart, cold, hard, insensible to all His innumerable beneficences, and put in its place a heart of flesh, a heart soft, warm, understanding, which responds eagerly and with abiding faith and answering love to all the manifesta tions of love, care and devotion which Yahweh, its own God, reveals unto it. Then and ever thereafter will Israel walk with Him in perfect accord, nor give further cause for divine wrath, punishment and expatriation. And then, in the sight of all the nations of the earth, Yahweh's holy name will be sanctified, and they will recognize His true power and authority and glory; then they too will praise His name and render homage unto Him and declare His greatness, His might, His justice and His goodness unto all men. This is Ezekiel's doctrine of "for His name's sake." Mani festly it grew out of Jeremiah's doctrine of "the new covenant" and represented an advance beyond this, perhaps not altogether logical, convincing and satisfying, but a distinct advance none the less. That this doctrine exerted a strong and penetrating influence upon the thought and theology of subsequent generations is evi denced convincingly by the numerous references to it throughout a large part of biblical literature. Thus Ps. 106.8, after recounting the sins of Israel in Egypt, declares: But He saved them for His name's sake, In order to make known His might. And Ps. 79.9-10 records the plea of the stricken nation: Help us, 0 God of our salvation, out of consideration for Thy glory,106 And deliver us and forgive our sins for Thy name's sake; Why should the nations say: Where is their God? 106 Reading with Buhl כבודך instead of כבוד שמך both for the sake of the meter and the desired parallelism with למען שמך.</page><page sequence="35">[35] psalm 48 Furthermore, Num. 14.15-19, a secondary passage, tells how Moses pleaded with the Deity on behalf of the sinful people: If Thou dost let this people die completely, then the na tions who have heard of Thy name107 will say : Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people to the land which He swore unto them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness .... Forgive the sin of this people according to Thy great faithfulness108. . . . And Yah weh said: According to thy word have I pardoned.10' Similarly Joel represents the priests as pleading:1 Show mercy, O Yahweh unto Thy people, nor let Thy land become a reproach, that nations should rule over them; Why should it be said among the peoples ; Where is their God? And Ps. 115.1 ff. argues: Not unto us, 0 Yahweh, not unto us, but unto Thy name give111 glory, because of Thy faithfulness108 and Thy integrity. Why should the nations say : Where then is their God ? But our God is in heaven; whatever He desires He does. The idols of the nations112 are silver and gold, the work of human hands; They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see; etc. And, somewhat closer to the specific thought of Ezekiel, Ps. 98.2-4 proclaims: Yahweh hath made known His salvation; before the eyes of the nations hath He disclosed His justification.113 107 Reading with G and 5 שסך for שמעך of MT. 108 Cf.

But on the other hand, it implies the convincing demonstra tion of Yahweh's power and authority to all the nations of the earth, with the resultant recognition of Him by them as the supreme world-God and world-Ruler, to whom their homage and praise are due. He is the universal King,119 who judges all the world, even all the nations, in justice. To Him therefore all people must come, either singly or as nations, to render active homage unto Him, to worship Him, to sing His praise and to glorify and sanctify His name. Even though perhaps not fully realized by Ezekiel at the moment of its proclamation, all this is inherently implicit in his doctrine of "for His name's sake." Returning now to Ps. 48, we can appreciate the full import of v. 11 : Even as Thy name, so also Thy praise (Doth reach) to the ends of the earth. 118 Quite significantly in the biblical literature from the period following Jeremiah the older term for "covenant," ברית, is used less and less frequently to describe the Deity's present and future relationship with Israel, and its place is taken by חסד, usually translated by the conventional and banal term, "lovingkindness," but which really has much of the meaning of "a compact or covenant" which rests, not upon a reciprocal agreement or contract, as does ברית, but rather upon an act of grace on the part of the Deity, the faithful and unending observance of a promise made to Israel, without any specific obligation resting upon Israel in return, but animated only by the hope that the realization of the full import of this promise and of the faithfulness and integrity with which it is kept may prompt Israel to gratefully and gladly act towards Yahweh with worthy and commensurate loyalty and piety (cf. above, note 108). Manifestly this term, חסד, expresses the basic implications of the "new covenant" far better than the older term, ברית, could possibly do. 119 Cf. Ps. 98.4, cited above, and below, pp. 38-47.</page><page sequence="38">38 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [38] The v. affirms, much as does Ps. 98, that Yahweh's name is known and honored and His praises are sung by those nations which dwell at the farthest corners of the earth, those therefore most remote from Jerusalem. It implies therefore that the goal of Ezekiel's doctrine, viz. the recognition by all the nations of the earth of Yahweh's world-power and authority, and their consequent homage to Him and praise and sanctification of His name, has already been achieved. The entire Ps. implies likewise that Israel has been restored to national existence, to Yahweh's favor, and to happy relations with Him. In this respect too Ezekiel's doctrine has been fulfilled. This evidence by itself establishes that the Ps. must be later than Ezekiel; and even sufficiently later for the conviction to have become firmly rooted that that which Ezekiel had envisaged for the future, viz. the recognition by the nations of Yahweh as the world-God, had actually been realized. V Yahweh as the Universal King Other evidence enables us to fix the date of the Ps. even more precisely. As has been said, basic to Ezekiel's doctrine is the principle of universalism. Ezekiel conceives of Yahweh as the world-God, whose dominion therefore extends over all nations, and even, by implication at least,120 over all the gods of these nations. The natural corollary of this concept is either that the gods of other nations have no real existence, are "no-gods," "nothings," as many writings of this period,121 following Deutero Isaiah,122 maintain, or else that, granting their reality, they are 120 For there is no clear indication that Ezekiel ever considered this par ticular implication of his doctrine thoroughly and formulated a definite opinion thereon. "1Cf. Isa. 40.18-20, 25; 44.9-20; 46.5-7; Deut. 32.17, 21; Jer. 8.19 (for the date of composition of this v. see below, note 126); 10.6-11; Ps. 97.7; 115.3-8; 135.15-18. 122 The dependence of Deutero-Isaiah upon Ezekiel's doctrine of "for His name's sake" is readily apparent. 48.9-11 (whether in v. 11, with Duhm, Marti and Kent, we emend למעני למעני to למען שמי, as in v. 9, or not) is in the main a literal reaffirmation of Ezekiel's doctrine (שמי must, of course, with</page><page sequence="39">[39] psalm 48 39 all inferior to Yahweh. In either case He is the lord, ruler, king of the entire universe, and in the latter case He is in addition the lord or king of the gods themselves;123 He is, in other words, the King par excellence, even as, as we have seen, Ps. 98.6, in its reaffirmation of Ezekiel's doctrine, calls Him. The interesting and important theme of the role of Yahweh as King has been discussed frequently by outstanding biblical scholars. As has been shown convincingly by von Gall124 and Eissfeldt,125 Isa. 6.5 and Jer. 8.19 are the only passages of un questionably pre-exilic composition126 which speak of Yahweh by the title, King. Von Gall contends that the implication of this title in Isa. 6.5 is not at all that He is king of the universe and of all the nations, for such a far-reaching doctrine of uni versalism was never conceived nor expressed by Isaiah. Rather most commentators either be understood or, with Torrey, as the meter actually demands, be supplied, as the subject of 40.1-2 .(יחל declares that the moment for Yahweh's forgiveness of Israel and restoration of it to its land and to happy relations with Himself has now come, and this all the more so since by this time Israel has suffered twofold for all its iniquities (something of Jeremiah's doctrine is obviously likewise implied here). But, the prophet goes on to pro claim, this restoration of Israel and forgiveness of its sins is but the preliminary step on Yahweh's part to the fulfillment of His far larger world-purpose (43.25), viz. His redemption of all the nations and the bringing of them to reject their false, unreal gods and acknowledge Him as the sole god of the universe and render homage unto Him and live the life He has intended for all His creatures. This is the basic and constant theme of Deutero-Isaiah's message. Its direct dependence upon Ezekiel's doctrine is self-evident. 123 Cf. the role of Yahweh as the supreme deity in the council of the gods, as outlined in "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," HUCA, XIV (1939), 40-70; cf. also Ps. 89.6-9; 95.3; 97.7-9. 124 "Ueber die Herkunft der Bezeichnung Jahwes als Kônig," Wellhausen Festschrift,Festschrift, 145-160.

(1928), 81-105. 126 And I am inclined to suspect that even Jer. 8.19 is an interpolation into its present setting, and is therefore not from Jeremiah himself, but is rather of post-exilic composition. Certainly w. 20-23 can follow directly and with perfect smoothness of thought and diction upon v. 18, in fact with perhaps greater unity and directness of thought than with the retention of v. 19. And were v. 19 not in its present position it would not be missed in the least. The dominant thought of the v. is that characteristic of the period following Deutero-Isaiah; cf. above, note 121.</page><page sequence="40">40 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [40] the implication of this term in Isa. 6.5, just as in Jer. 8.19 and in other manifestly post-exilic writings,"7 is that Yahweh is primarily the king of Zion, of the holy mountain and of the sanctuary upon it; and •this title He enjoys because, in the in evitable process of religious syncretism, He has inherited this title from the pre-Israelite deity of Jerusalem, Sedek, or however he may have been called. This hypothesis may have some mea sure of validity, even though it presumes a much more extensive knowledge of the pre-Israelite, Canaanite cult of Sedek in Jeru salem than we actually possess. Far more probable, however, is the theory that the concept of Yahweh as King was one of the very earliest products of Phoenician cultural influence upon Israel, beginning already in the latter portion of the reign of David and reaching a culminât ing point in the erection of the Temple in the reign of Solomon. From this moment on, at least in the official cult of the Temple, if not in the religious belief and practice of the people at large, Yahweh was conceived as the divine King who, upon each recur ring New Year's Day, entered the Temple, attended by all His divine host, minor deities and angelic beings, seated Himself upon His throne and pronounced judgment upon and determined the destinies of His own and of the immediately neighboring peoples and, no doubt, of their deities also, for the year just beginning. He was conceived of, not primarily as the universal King, although something of this concept was latent in the general belief, but rather as the king of the gods, the supreme one, the ruler of the host of heaven. From the moment of the erection of Solomon's Temple this concept of Yahweh as the divine king took firm root in the religious consciousness, belief and practice of Israel, of both the Southern and the Northern Kingdoms, and seemingly more firmly in the Jerusalem Temple than anywhere or in any sanctuary of the Northern Kingdom, and persisted steadily, despite intense opposition to it on the part of the prophets of the ninth century B.C. and their sup porters, and gradually evolved into the positive picture of Yah weh as the divine King which we find portrayed so graphically 127 Ex. 15.17-18; Isa. 24.23; Mic. 4.7, et al.</page><page sequence="41">[41] psalm 48 41 in Isa. 6 and in subsequent biblical and post-biblical literature.128 But in all this there is not the slightest implication that Yahweh was conceived of as Israel's actual king, in a literal sense, before the formulation and official promulgation of the doctrine of the theocracy at the dedication of the second Temple in 516 B.C. And actually a moment's thought should show that it could not well have been otherwise, that it is almost inconceivable that during the period of the actual monarchy, i. e. during the entire pre-exilic period, Yahweh should have been regarded as the King of even Israel alone, much less King of the universe. For during this entire period this title, King of Israel or King of Judah, was borne only by the earthly, human king himself. And while it is true that he seems to have been regarded as the earthly surrogate of Yahweh as well as the chief ecclesiastic functionary of the nation,129 and even perhaps to have been thought to himself be endowed with certain attributes of divinity, none the less it does not follow at all that, alongside of the human king, Yahweh too might have borne this title and have been conceived of as the true, supreme King of Israel. On the contrary, during this entire period Yahweh bore an even higher title, that of God of Israel; but in no way did He share with the earthly king that decidedly lesser title and dignity. It was not until the post-exilic period, and more precisely not until after the crushing of the rebellion of Zerubabel and the nipping in the bud of this unfortunate attempt to restore a Davidic king to the throne of Judah, and the subsequent reor ganization of the people of Judah, by the Persians and by their Judaean supporters, as a theocracy instead of as a nation, and with the chief priest of the new Temple at Jerusalem, rebuilt with Persian permission and assistance as a vital element in this reorganization scheme, supplanting the king as the recog nized earthly head of the people and inducted into his sacred 128 Accordingly what stood originally in the debir of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem was in all likelihood a golden image of Yahweh, sitting enthroned as a king; cf.

Yahweh Himself was its true King, the new Temple was the seat of His royal authority, and the "anointed priest" therein was now His earthly representative, perhaps even His earthly surrogate. But from this it was a not far distant step to the still larger concept, implicit in Ezekiel's doctrine, of Yahweh as universal King, King of all gods132 and King of all nations.133 To Him therefore, as universal King, enthroned on Zion, it was fitting indeed that both gods and nations come and prostrate them selves and render homage.134 In the period following immediately upon the restoration of the Temple,135 the ideas and principles inherent in this doctrine, as first formulated by Ezekiel and as subsequently expanded by Deutero-Isaiah, were in the main quite realistic. At the very most there was only a modicum of an incipient eschatological thought and theology implicit in them. "° Ibid, 183-192. «■ Isa. 41.21; 43.15; 44.6; Mic. 2.13; 4.7; Zeph. 3.15.

They reflect the reaction of a certain important section of the people to the then projected restoration of the Davidic kingship in the person of a certain Menahem. The evidence for this will be presented in a subsequent study. 132 Cf. the term, המלך יהוה צבאות, Jer. 46.18; 48.15; 51.57, all admittedly post-exilic passages; also Ps. 95.3; 96.4, 10; 97.9 and passim. 133 Cf.

All the post-exilic passages cited thus far must obviously be assigned to this brief but exceedingly important and literarily productive period.</page><page sequence="43">[43] psalm 48 43 It was a period in which a universalistic outlook upon life and a confident hope for the unification and salvation of all mankind were dominant and immediate. It was an age in which new religious systems were being formulated136 and a larger religious vision and promise were asserting themselves in widely separated parts of the earth. Mankind was drawing together to a degree perhaps never surpassed in all human history. In Judaism in particular this trend was positive and active. It was a period of actual and apparently quite extensive prose lytism to Judaism. Deutero-Isaiah's message of universalism, of the bringing of all mankind to the knowledge and worship of Yahweh and to the living of the life ordained by Him for all men, was finding realization in two directions, the one some what theoretical, the other realistic and actual. Zechariah had announced,137 in his enthusiasm over the prospect of the rebuild ing of the Temple,138 that this happy moment would inaugurate a period of widespread conversion to the cult of Yahweh, and this both on the part of entire nations, peoples and communities and also on the part of single individuals. That this was no vain dream but was actually realized in significant measure is con vincingly attested by Isa. 56.1-7, a prophecy uttered some years later when, under the influence of a resurgent nationalism, begin ning shortly after 500 B.C., the tide began to turn away from a thoroughgoing universalism, with its corollary of active prosely tism, and the proselyte began to be regarded with antipathy and distrust. Then it was that the anonymous prophet bravely championed the now unpopular cause of the disfranchised prose lyte to Judaism and declared it to be Yahweh's will that His house should continue to be called a house of prayer for all the peoples of the earth.139 But this establishes convincingly that 136 Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Pythagoreanism. «7 8.20-23. "38 Or perhaps, and not at all improbably, at the very dedication of the second Temple on the New Year's Day, 516 B.C. (cf. "A Chapter in the History of the High-Priesthood," 183-193), which he himself undoubtedly witnessed. '39!39!39 Using this full term in order to bring out the true implication of the article in העמים.</page><page sequence="44">44 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [44] the proselyting movement in Judaism must have been until this moment sufficiently active and extensive to have created a vital issue in the religious life and practice of the Jewish people.140 And in another direction as well this trend toward universal ism in Judaism manifested itself, in the quite natural identifica tion of Yahweh with the gods of other nations, in the endeavor to represent Him as, not so much the ruler or king of all the gods, but rather as the equation or summation of all the gods of all the other nations. This idea is expressed clearly in Mai. 1.11 and 14b, a prophetic utterance coming undoubtedly from the period between 500 and 490 B.C.:141 140 Deut. 23.2, a piece of post-exilic legislation, may very well be the basis of the anti-proselyte movement against which the anonymous prophet protests. Vv. 3-4 would likewise be the product of the period following immediately upon the great national catastrophe in 485 B.C. at the hands of the little, neighboring states, and would be directed specifically against the Philistines (for ממזר as a designation of the Philistines, and especially the inhabitants of Ashdod, with whom apparently during this and the immediately subsequent period there was extensive intermarriage, cf. Zech. 9.6; Neh. 13.23-25), Ammonites and Moabites (cf. Lam. 1.10b), and would prohibit absolutely all proselyting from among them. Undoubtedly Edom too, which seemingly had taken the lead in the coalition of the neighboring states against Judah in 485 B.C., was originally included in this list of prohibited nations. Vv. 8-9 represent then a concession, coming from the period about 400 B.C. or slightly later, on the one hand, to the Edomites, who had by that time, due to the steadily growing Nabataean pressure upon them in their native land, come to settle extensively in Southern Judaea (cf. Glueck, "The Boundaries of Edom," HUCA,HUCA, XI [1936], 153-157), and no doubt to intermarry with the native Jewish population of that district and accept Judaism, and, on the other hand, to the Jews of Egypt (cf. "Supplementary Studies in the Calendars of Ancient Egypt," HUCA, X [1935], 129, note 211), among whom intermarriage with native Egyptians was a common practice. This marks the beginning of the reaction away from the extreme nationalism, separatism and particularism, which characterized the second half of the fifth century B.C., in the direction of that renascent and qualified universalism which we find expressed here and there in the Priestly Code (cf. Gen. 1.1-2.4; 9.1-17; Ex. 19.6a). 1u Von Bulmerincq {Der Prophet Maleachi, I, 126-132) assigns this passage to the period, 480-475 B.C.; but for cogent reasons, which likewise will be set forth in the study referred to in notes 131 and 135, I must assign it to a period some fifteen to twenty years earlier.</page><page sequence="45">[45] psalm 48 45 For from the rising of the sun unto its going down My name is great among the nations; And in every sanctuary1"2 incense is burned to My name143 and a pure sacrifice is offered. For a great King am I, saith Yahweh Sebaot, and awe inspiring is My name among the nations. In these and the intervening w. we see, first of all, once again the expression of Ezekiel's doctrine of "for His name's sake" in its reciprocal aspects of the desecration as well as of the glori fication of Yahweh's name, and this both in Israel itself and also among the nations. And here, very significantly, it is the nations far and wide which sanctify Yahweh's name, while it is sinful and unregenerate Israel which, by its wilful conduct, persists in desecrating it. Obviously to the prophetic author of this passage it must have seemed that in its ultimate goal Ezekiel's doctrine had found complete fulfillment, even though in the accompanying process, the supplanting by Yahweh of Israel's heart of stone by a heart of flesh and its resultant regeneration, comparatively little progress had been achieved. But even more significant is the representation of Yahweh here as the universal King. The passage says unmistakably that wherever incense is burned and sacrifice is offered, in any sane tuary in the midst of any nation throughout the entire earth, regardless of the name and concept of the particular deity of that sanctuary, to whom his devotees may fondly believe they are offering their homage, actually that deity is identical with or is contained in Yahweh; therefore this worship and this horn age are in reality being offered unto Yahweh;144 and thus His universal godhead and kingship are being acknowledged by all 142 מקום. 143 Reading, with the majority of the commentators, ובכל מקום מקטר לשמי ומנחה טהורה מנשה, and thus restoring both the obvious meaning and the metrical form of the distich. 144 Similarly Eissfeldt (Baal Zaphon, Zeus Kasios und der Durchzug der IsraelitenIsraeliten durchs Meer, 12 f.) interprets Ps. 89.13 to mean that the gods of Çafon (Mt. Casios), Amanus (reading אמנה [cf. Cant. 4.8] for ימין of MT), Tabor and Hermon, four mountains whose sanctity, as seats of important deities, was of great antiquity, are equated or identified with Yahweh. This Ps. too,</page><page sequence="46">46 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [46] the nations of the earth. This is perhaps the most extreme con cept of universalism to find expression in this period of rampant universalism. It must have been uttered by the prophet in one of his earliest, quite probably even his very first, prophetic mes sage ; for there is good reason to believe that the prophet himself later, under the influence of the resurgent nationalism which began to express itself in Judah about 490 B.C.,143 gradually reverted from this extreme and all-inclusive theory of univer salism to one much more moderate and tempered by a very natural and pervasive nationalism.146 Malachi's concept of Yah weh as the universal King, who is worshiped in one form or another and under one name or another by all the nations of the earth, is manifestly a logical, even though an extreme, and cer tainly an unforeseen, development out of Ezekiel's doctrine of "for His name's sake." Very significantly Malachi represents Yahweh as proclaiming that He is a great King, with implications of universalism inher ent in this exalted title. But this title, מלך גדול, is almost identical with the title, מלך רב, which Ps. 48.3 applies to Yahweh. Cer tainly with this specific designation of Yahweh as King, this Ps. can not under any circumstance be of pre-exilic composition.147 or at least this section of it (vv. 2-3, 6-19), is unquestionably the product of the same period as Ps. 48A (notice that Ps. 89.19 likewise applies to Yahweh the title, King). A development markedly similar in character, which identi fied the main Canaanite deities with those of Egypt, seems to have taken place in Egypt some eight hundred years earlier and to have marked the climax of the trend towards universalism during the period of the Eighteenth Dynasty (cf. Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity, 169 f.). As one of the immediate effects of the Battle of Marathon and of the convincing demonstration which this battle gave that the great Persian Empire was by no means invincible, and that even a little, numerically almost in significant people, such as the Athenians, or even the Jews, could hope to defy and contend with it successfully and ultimately regain independence. 146 The evidence for this assertion must likewise await a more favorable opportunity for presentation, since beyond this point it is not vital for our consideration of Ps. 48. 147 So also Eissfeldt, "Jahwe als Kônig," ZAW, S (n. F.) (1928), 104; Oesterley, The Psalms, I, 53 f. (Oesterley would even assign all the Psalms [cf. p. 44 ff.] which represent Yahweh as King to a period as late as circa 300 B.C., but upon grounds not at all convincing.)</page><page sequence="47">psalm 48 47 And inasmuch as we have already had cumulative evidence that the Ps. must be later than Ezekiel, what conclusion can be more natural and logical than to regard it as contemporaneous with this earliest utterance of Malachi and assign it to the period 500-490 B.C.? VI Safon And still one other consideration, vital to the complete and cor rect interpretation of the Ps., confirms this conclusion. This same v. 3 describes the Temple mount in these significant words: Of majestic elevation is His holy mount, Joy of the entire earth; Mount Zion is yarkHe Safon, Citadel of the mighty King. Manifestly the concept basic to this v. is that the Temple Mount is the highest mountain of the world, and upon it is the earthly throne of Yahweh. This concept of the exaltation of Mount Zion, with its implied corollary, that it is thus the center or navel of the earth, finds expression in quite a number of biblical passages and plays a role of much more than passing significance in extra biblical and related literature.148 1 Ki. 9.8 ( = 2 Chron. 7.21) speaks of the sanctuary upon the Temple mount as 149,עליון i. e. of supreme height; and similarly Ezek. 40.2 says that this moun tain was very high, while 43.12 provides that the new Temple is to be built upon its summit, with the territory immediately surrounding of most sacred and inviolable character. Ps. 78.69 records that Yahweh had built His sanctuary upon a place of 18י Cf. Wensinck, The Ideas of the Western Semites concerning the Navel of the the Earth, and the passages, biblical and post-biblical, cited by him; also 1 Enoch 26.1 and Charles' note thereto; likewise Burch, Anthropology and the the Apocalypse, 130, 147 ff., 160, 203. 1■י» So also apparently Ps. 87.5. Ps. 68.30 too seems to mean that the sanctuary upon the Temple Mount was at an elevation higher than that of Jerusalem.</page><page sequence="48">48 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [48] lofty elevation.130 The most graphic representation of this con cept is that in the oft-cited passage, Mic. 4.1-4:151 And upon the very last day it shall be that The mountain of Yahweh's house will be established as the topmost of the mountains And exalted above the hills; and peoples will stream unto it; And many nations will go and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, even unto the house of the God of Jacob,132 That He may teach us of His ways and we may walk in His paths; For from Zion will revelation go forth, even the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. And He will judge between many peoples, and will rebuke mighty nations (who dwell) afar off, So that they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning-hooks ; Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more,133 150 Following a hint of 5 and reading במרום instead of כמדרמים of MT (assuming that the final ם of רמים is the result of dittography) and בארץ for כארץ ; cf. also Ezek. 20.40. 151 With the first half of which Isa. 2.2-4 is identical, and upon which Joel 4.10 is manifestly dependent. It is obvious that biblical passages such as these, which envisage the ultimate salvation of all nations and peoples, i. e. of all mankind, quite in the spirit of Deutero-Isaiah, and their own spontaneous seeking Yahweh out and adopting His way of life (cf. Zech. 8.20-23), must be ascribed to the period of dominant universalism, 516-485 B.C., and more particularly to the first half of this period. The steadily recrudescent nation alism of the period beginning shortly after 500 B.C. and culminating in the second attempt to regain national independence and to restore the Davidic kingdom in 485 B.C. (the evidence of which I hope to present later, cf. note 131), and the unfortunate outcome of this rebellion and the quite natural separatistic and particularistic reaction of Palestine Jewry thereto in the years which followed, forbid the assignment of all such passages as these to any other period in Israel's history, either earlier or later. 1s2 Zech. 8.20-22 illustrates concretely precisely what this expectation was. !53 With this motif of Yahweh making all war to cease cf. Ps. 46.10 (not at all improbably the background of vv. 7, 9-10 was furnished by the military activities of Cyrus, Cambyses and Darius I). As v. 11 indicates, this Ps. too can come only from the period of dominant universalism, i. e. circa 500 B.C. (cf. also Zech. 9.10; Jubilees 8; 1 Enoch 26.1; Sybilline Oracles III, 755-757,</page><page sequence="49">[49] psalm 48 49 But they will dwell, each man under his own vine and under his own fig-tree, with none to make them afraid ; For the mouth of Yahweh Sebaot hath ordained. The passage is, of course, eschatological. It too envisages the Temple mount, despite its actually comparatively humble ele vation, as the highest mountain of the world; but this it will become only through the fulfillment of divine purpose upon the very last day,154 the Day of Yahweh, the day of Yahweh's judg ment of the nations, the day of the final salvation of mankind and of their return to Yahweh, when all men will at last begin to conform to His revelation, to walk in His paths and to live the life of peace and brotherhood which He has ordained for all His children.155 Precisely what is meant by the exaltation of Mt. Zion as the highest of the mountains, whether it be, as here, as an eschato logical circumstance, or as, as apparently in the other passages which we have cited, a present reality in the minds of their respective authors, is made clear by two passages in 1 Enoch, in that section of the book156 which recounts the journeys of Enoch, under angelic guidance, through the earth and Sheol. 18.6-14 reads thus: And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night, where there are seven mountains of mag nificent stones, three towards the east, and three towards the south. And as for those towards the east, &lt;one&gt; was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone. But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit of the throne was of sapphire. And I saw a flaming fire. And beyond 780-781; V, 253-255 for expressions of this persistent hope of the end of all warfare and resultant universal peace). 154 So also Rev. 21.10. This elevation of the Temple Mount upon the last day was no doubt expected to be one of the effects of the great earthquake, one of the traditional attendant phenomena of the day; cf. Zech. 14.4-10, (perhaps also Ps. 46.3-4); 4 Ezra 6.14-16; 13.6, 36, and below, note 227, and also "Amos Studies II." 155 In other words, the fulfillment of Deutero-Isaiah's scheme of universal salvation. According to Charles (Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testa ment, II, 170) a part of one of the oldest strata of 1 Enoch, antedating 170 B.C.</page><page sequence="50">50 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [50] these mountains is a region the end of the great earth : there the heavens were completed. And I saw a deep abyss And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and no firmly founded earth beneath it The angel said: 'This place is the end of heaven and earth.'157 24.2-25.5 gives an even more explicit account of what is undoubtedly the same range of mountains158 and the adjacent localities, even though this identity is not specifically stated: And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance159 and fair exterior: three towards the east, one founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and deep, rough ravines, no one of which joined with any other. And the seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them in height, resembling the seat of a throne: and fragrant trees encircled the throne. And amongst them was a tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor were others like it: it had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its leaves and blooms and wood wither not for ever: and its fruit is beautiful, and its fruit resembles the dates of a palm. Then I said : 'How beautiful is this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms very delightful in appear ance.' Then answered Michael, one of the holy and honoured angels who was with me, and was their leader. And he said unto me: 'Enoch, why dost thou ask me regard ing the fragrance of the tree, and why dost thou wish to learn the truth?' Then I answered him saying: 'I wish to know about 157 The translation is that of Charles, op. cit. 158 1 Enoch 77.4 likewise speaks of seven mountains higher than all the mountains of the earth; but even though also located in the far north, this seems to be a somewhat different group of mountains, although there is some apparent confusion of the two groups of mountains, quite as if this second group were an eastern projection of the first group, still lying, however, upon the northern edge of the earth. 189 The words describing these mountains, "of glorious appearance," should probably be rendered more exactly, "of radiant appearance," implying a Hebrew original מראה כבוד or even מראה נגה, corresponding to מראה הנגה סביב הוא מראה דמות כבוד יהוה of Ezek. 1.28.</page><page sequence="51">[51] psalm 48 51 everything, but especially about this tree.' And he answered saying: 'This high mountain which thou hast seen, whose sum mit is like the throne of God, is His throne, where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory,160 the Eternal King, will sit, when He shall come down to visit the earth with goodness. And as for this fragrant tree no mortal is permitted to touch it till the great judgement, when He shall take vengeance on all and bring (everything) to its consummation for ever. It shall then be given to the righteous and holy. Its fruit shall be for food to the elect: it shall be transplanted to the holy place, to the temple of the Lord, the Eternal King. Then shall they rejoice with joy and be glad, And into the holy place shall they enter; And its fragrance shall be in their bones, And they shall live a long life on earth, Such as their fathers lived:161 And in their days shall no sorrow or plague Or torment or calamity touch them.' These two passages tell of a range or complex of seven mountains set in the form of a right angle. The highest moun tain of the complex forms the apex of the angle. From this 1601, e. אדון הכבוד. This entire title of the Deity probably reflects an origi nal Hebrew הקדוש הגדול אדון הכבוד מלך עולם. It is obviously an expression litur gical in character, and probably evidences the influence of the developing Jew ish liturgy of the fourth, third and second centuries B.C. (Cf. Kohler, The Origins Origins of Synagogue and Church). With the title, מלך עולם, "Eternal King," for the Deity, cf. Jer. 10.10; Ps. 10.16; 29.10 (also Ex. 15.18; Ps. 146.10; Prov. 29.14; all these passages come from the post-exilic period), and particularly Mai. 1.14 and v. 3 of our Ps. 161 The reference is, of course, to the ages of the antediluvian heroes, re corded in Gen. 5 (P), where apparently a thousand years constituted the nor mally perfect and ideal life-span. The specific implication here is that, dwelling in the Temple courts and partaking of the fruit of the tree of life, these right eous too will live for approximately one thousand years, while the general implication is that for them the golden age of existence will be restored, just as the Deity had at creation intended it to be for men, and as, according to P, speaking broadly, it actually was, until the growing sinfulness of mankind brought about a steady diminution of the human life-span and eventually necessitated the flood (cf.

Beyond them is the fiery abyss, in which the rebellious angels are imprisoned await ing their eventual judgment and doom.162 This is obviously the bor,bor, "the pit," as it is usually translated, referred to quite fre quently in biblical writings.163 Beyond the abyss is a waste and !62 çf "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 76 ff. In rabbinic tradition Hell lay originally beyond the mountains of darkness (i. e. the moun tains to the far north, whence darkness comes; cf. 1 Enoch 77.3, and above, note 158). Hell and Paradise were adjacent to each other, so that one could look from the one place to the other (cf. Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, V, 19, note 55). On the last day both Paradise and Hell, still in immediate contiguity, are destined to be transferred to Jerusalem, the former to the Temple Mount and the latter to the immediately adjacent Valley of Hinnom (op. cit., 117, note 109; cf. below, note 227). 165 In Isa. 14.15; 38.18; Ezek. 31.16; Ps. 30.4; Prov. 1.12 bor, the pit or abyss, is equated with Sheol. In Isa. 24.22 it is the place of detention, not only of the "kings of the earth," but also of the rebellious members of the "host of heaven," awaiting their ultimate doom, precisely as in the pseudepigraphic literature (cf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 100, 109, note 143, 125 f.). In Ezek. 26.20; 31.14, 16; 32.18, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30; Ps. 28.1; 88.5; 143.7; Lam. 3.55 it is the abode of the dead, and in this respect is again identical with Sheol. According to Ezek. 31.16 (reading החוזיות as elsewhere); 32.18; Ps. 88.7; Lam. 3.55 there are various levels or stages within the abyss, while, according to Ezek. 32.23, it has its deep recesses (yarkete bor-, cf. the determi nation of the meaning of yark'te Safon, below, note 220), where apparently the graves of arch-offenders are located. Ps. 88.7 pictures it as the place of darkness. In all these respects it is identical with Sheol (cf. Deut. 32.22; Isa. 38.10; Ps. 86.13; Prov. 9.18). All these passages without exception come from post-exilic writings. Apparently the term, bor, in the specific, mythological sense, the pit or abyss, and apparently too the concept itself, were unknown in the pre-exilic period. The concept seems to have entered into the thought of Judaism either in the early post-exilic period or, at the very earliest, during the exile, and, of course, from some foreign source. That source could have been only North Semitic mythology, transmitted to Israel through Phoenician mediation. The passages cited above show that the pit or abyss was speedily identified with Sheol, already recognized as the realm of the dead in pre-exilic times, and so was located beneath, rather than at the ends of, the earth, and was regarded as a place of intense darkness. But apparently too the persistent</page><page sequence="53">[53] psalm 48 53 horrible region, with neither heaven above nor earth beneath, nor water upon it nor birds,164 manifestly the tohu wabohn or the influence of the North Semitic mythological tradition gradually recast the composite concept of Sheol-Bor, until finally, at some time within the fourth century B.C., the location of Sheol-Bor was shifted from its original position beneath the earth, to the place which the pit or abyss occupied in the old North Semitic mythology, at, or rather, just beyond, the northern edge of the earth, and became now, not so much the realm of the dead, as rather the place where the rebellious angels, and ultimately also the souls of the dead, are detained, awaiting the final judgment of God upon them upon the last day, whether for eternal reward or eternal punishment (cf. Dan. 12.2). As such too Sheol Bor at the edge of the earth became a place of flame and smoke rather than of sheer darkness, as Sheol had been originally. Quite naturally the fusion of two such concepts as Sheol and Bor, originally closely similar in some respects but likewise diametrically antithetical in other respects, led to not a little confusion of ideas. Nor could the new concept of Sheol-Bor at the end of the earth, and as a place of fire and of detention of the rebellious angels, completely supplant the older concept of Sheol as the realm of the dead, the place of deepest darkness immediately beneath the earth, where the dead repose in a shadow-like existence, the natural sequel to life upon earth, and with no consideration of reward and punishment. The older concept persisted alongside of the later, and crops up not infrequently in very late biblical and post-biblical writings, as, for example, as we have just seen, in Dan. 12.2. None the less it was the younger, composite concept which became domi nant in eschatological thought and speculation. A fairly early and clear ex pression of it is to be found in Isa. 24.21-22. Quite naturally it expanded in various directions. Ps. 88.12; Prov. 15.11; 27.20; Job 26.6; 28.22; 31.12 record a new, and obviously a symbolical, name for Bor, viz. Abaddon. According to Rev. 9.1-3, 11 Abaddon is the name of the angelic ruler of the abyss. Rev. 11.7; 17.8 picture the beast coming up from out the abyss, and Rev. 20.1-3 repre sents the abyss as the place of imprisonment for one thousand years, the period of waiting for final divine judgment and punishment, of the old serpent, who is the Devil and Satan. This is manifestly the same concept of Bor as in Isa. 24.21-22. But equally manifestly, we are dealing here once again with figures and concepts borrowed largely from and constantly shaped by the steadily persisting influence of ancient North Semitic mythology (cf. Burch, Anthropology Anthropology and. the Apocalypse, especially pp. 144 ft.). 164 This seems to be the picture of the cosmos basic to Job. 28.20-28. The place of wisdom is so remote that it is (a) beyond the uttermost limits of the habitable earth, for no living creature, which lives on earth, nor bird of heaven, which dwells in heaven, just above the earth, and which, just as here in 1 Enoch 18.12, may not fly beyond the boundaries of heaven and earth, have ever beheld it, while (b) Abaddon (cf. the preceding note) and Death</page><page sequence="54">54 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [54] tehomtehom of Gen. 1.2, as these were after the separation of heaven and earth from them at creation. As Charles has shown, this complex of seven mountains, forming a right angle, with one line of mountains extending eastward and the other line southward, must constitute the northwestern corner of the earth; or, perhaps stated more pre cisely, since not only earth, but heaven also end just here, the northwestern corner of earth and heaven together, of the uni verse, as we may say. But this, in turn, carries with it a signifi cant implication, viz. that both earth and heaven are pictured as lying the one just above, or just beneath, the other and each having the shape of a square or rectangle, more probably the former, with the four sides of each oriented precisely to the four cardinal points of the compass.165 It is precisely the same concept which we find set forth in biblical writings again and again.166 (Mawet or Mot, the ruler of Sheol or the abyss; Isa. 28.15, 18; 38.18; Ps. 18.5-6 [ = 2 Sam. 22.5-6]; Prov. 5.5; Cant. 8.6) have heard only a faint rumor of it. In other words, the place of wisdom lies not only beyond the confines of the habitable world, but even far beyond the ends of Sheol-Bor, (c) so far in fact beyond these bounds that God, who can see to the very ends of the earth (here used obviously, for want of a better term, in the very broadest sense, to include the habitable earth, the abyss and all that lies beyond this) and can peer under all the heavens (i. e. the seven heavens of apocalyptic tradition), alone knows the way thither. 165 For the eastern, northern and southern ends or sides of the earth cf. 1 Enoch 33-36. 166 The end or ends of the earth are referred to in the following passages; Deut. 4.32; 13.8; 28.64; Isa. 5.26; 26.15; 40.28; 41.5; 42.10; 43.6; 48.20; 49.6; 62.11;62.11; Jer. 10.13; 12.12; 25.31, 33; 51.16; Ps. 46.10; 48.11; 61.3; 65.6, 9; 135.7; Prov. 17.24; Job 28.24. Job 37.3; 38.13 speak of the corners of the earth, while Isa. 11.12 and Ezek. 7.2 speak more specifically of the four corners of the earth. Num. 22.41; Deut. 4.32; 30.4; Isa. 13.5; Ps. 19.7; Neh. 1.9 make refer ence to the ends of heaven, and Jer. 49.36 refers specifically to the four ends of heaven, whence come the four winds. Ps. 19.5 speaks of the "end of the universe" (k'çe tebel). Tebel in all likelihood connotes heaven and earth to gether, the two habitable spheres of the cosmos, conceived as a unit (so also 1 Sam. 2.8, where tebel, i. e. heaven and earth together, is set upon the pillars of the earth, located presumably at the four corners of earth and heaven to gether; Ps. 18.16 [ — 2 Sam. 22.16], where the foundations of tebel, i. e. no doubt the base upon which the pillars of the earth rest, are at the bottom of the sea; cf. also Jer. 10.21; 51.15; Ps. 24.1-2; 89.12; 90.2; note also that in Akkadian literature the Mountain of Aralû, which, as we will see, corresponds to Safon,</page><page sequence="55">[55] psalm 48 55 But precisely the same concept finds repeated expression in Akkadian literature; for the four sides of the earth and the regions immediately adjacent to them are the four kibrâti167 or the four tubukàti.168 Manifestly this concept is not peculiarly Israelite or Jewish, but was held quite generally throughout the North Semitic world. We will see convincingly that it found expression in early North Semitic mythology, and that from there it spread in various directions and to different peoples and even tually penetrated into Jewish thought and speculation. It is noteworthy that all of the seven mountains in this complex are of varying height, no two apparently of the same level, even though they may stand on opposite sides of the central peak. Moreover, each mountain is composed of a precious stone, each different from the others. The seventh mountain, in at the northwest corner of the earth, reaches down into the netherworld, and so is the pillar of the earth at this corner [cf. Delitzsch, Wo Lag das Parodies, 117-122]); the end of tebel would then be the place where both earth and heaven end; this is precisely the same concept that we have met in 1 Enoch 18.14. Of much more than passing interest is the fact that of all the thirty eight biblical references to the end or ends of the earth or heaven only Isa. 5.26 while of the thirty-six reference to tebel not one, is generally regarded by bibli cal scholars as pre-exilic; all the other passages are unquestionably exilic or post-exilic. (I have long questioned whether Isa. 5.26-29 is from Isaiah, and should not rather be regarded as post-exilic and eschatological [this is the opinion of Gressmann likewise]. There is very little in the passage which speaks for Isaianic composition and very much which speaks against it.) This very significant evidence seems to establish quite conclusively that likewise (cf. above, note 163) this concept of heaven and earth and universe {tebel), with its elaborate cosmological setting, was not current in Israel during the pre exilic period, but came to it only during the exilic or very early post-exilic period and unquestionably from some foreign source. 167 Cf. Delitzsch, HWB, 315; related no doubt to kibru, "edge, border" {ibid.);{ibid.); cf. also Jensen, Die Kosmologie der Babylonier, 163-184. !68 Delitzsch, op. cit., 701. This suggestion I owe to the kindness of my friend and colleague, Professor Julius Lewy. Professor W. M. MacGovern has very generously called my attention to the fact that in the mythology of ancient India the world is conceived in very much the same manner as this, with Mt. Meru as its highest mountain and the seat of the great gods (cf. Warren, Paradise Found, 148-154; MacGovern, Manual of Buddhist Philoso phy,phy, 51-56), and that a closely similar concept of the world exists in the mythology of ancient China (cf. Warren, op. cit., 128 f. ; 143-147; cf. also Delitzsch, Parodies, 112-116; Jensen, op. cit., 208-212).</page><page sequence="56">56 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [56] the center of the complex, is the highest of all and reaches up to, or into, the heaven. It is composed of alabaster, while the divine throne upon its summit, and therefore actually located in the heaven as well as on earth, is of sapphire. This complex of seven mountains, each of a different height, and all inclining upwards, as it were, to the highest peak in the center, upon which is the throne of the supreme deity, cannot but call to mind the Babylonian seven-staged temple, with the cell of the deity upon the summit. It seems not at all improbable that this seven-staged temple-tower was in origin an artificial représenta tion, not so much of a single mountain,169 as rather of this com plex of seven mountains. The seven stages of the temple-tower would represent the seven mountains of the complex, each of varying elevation, while the cell of the deity at the top would correspond to the throne of the supreme deity at the very sum mit of the highest peak of the complex,170 and so would be in a 169 Cf. Delitzsch, op. cit., 119 f.; Jensen, op. cit., 206 f., 255. According to Jensen the earth was conceived by the Babylonians as a great mountain. ■70 Without questioning the ultimate correctness of Zimmern's cosmolog ical interpretation (KATi, 615-617; following Jensen and Winckler), viz. that these seven stages represent the seven heavens or the seven regions of the universe, it is difficult to believe that this seven-staged temple-tower is not an institution much older than this comparatively complex, and therefore advanced and relatively late, cosmological concept, and that it did not rather represent, in an earlier stage of cultural evolution, a mountain (so Albright, "The Babylonian Temple-Tower and the Altar of Burnt-Offering," JBL. XXXIX [1920], 137; Gressmann, AOTB', II, 138), or even such a complex of seven mountains as that of the Book of Enoch, with each mountain of the group rising higher than its outer neighbor, and culminating in the very highest mountain at the center, upon which the supreme deity himself was thought to be enthroned. It may well be that this was the true origin of the seven-staged temple-tower. In fact this hypothesis finds very significant con firmation in Gudea's statement (Cyl. A, 24.15-17 [Thureau-Dangin, Die sume rischenrischen und akkadischen Kônigsinschriften: VAB, I, 1, 116/7]), that the temple of Nin-Girsu "like a mountain of blue stone he built, like a mountain of shining marble he erected it for admiration." Here not only is this temple distinctly likened to a mountain but also and more specifically to a mountain composed entirely of blue marble. The mythological background of this simile is unmis takable. It can not but remind us of the seven mountains in the Book of Enoch, each composed of a different precious stone and each of a distinctive color. Furthermore, inasmuch as in the Mesopotamian Valley itself the concept of a sacred complex of seven mountains could not possibly have arisen, its origin</page><page sequence="57">[57] psalm 48 57 must be sought outside the Valley, among a people resident, in the earlier stages of its history, before its migration into the Valley, in a distinctly moun tainous region. In such case the cosmological interpretation of the seven staged temple-tower, which Zimmern supports, would have evolved only in the course of time, and naturally within the precincts of the Mesopotamian Valley. The very absence of mountains within the Mesopotamian Valley proper, the new home of this migrating people, might have come in time to almost necessitate this new interpretation of the seven-staged temple-tower■ an interpretation now more in accord with the expanding world-view and cosmological system of this people. Moreover, with the item recorded by Zimmern, that the Babylonians linked the seven stages of their temple-towers with the gods of the seven planets, and accordingly assigned a different color to each, we may associate the fact that these seven mountains of 1 Enoch 18 and 24-25 are each of a single precious stone, of varying colors and of radiant appearance, and perhaps also the addi tional fact that the seven mountains of 1 Enoch 52 (cf. 67.4 and Charles' note to 52.2) are each of a different metal, iron, copper, silver, gold, soft metal, lead and tin. Even more significant perhaps is the fact that the highest stage of the seven-staged temple-tower of Babylon, Etemenanki, and of the four staged temple-tower at Ur was built of blue-glazed bricks (cf. Gressmann! AOTB2,AOTB2, II, nos. 473, 474, 663 and pp. 137 f., 189); for, in all likelihood, this blue structure at the very peak of the temple-tower symbolized the sapphire throne of the supreme deity at the summit of the highest peak of the seven mountains (cf. below, pp. 66 ff.). It should be noted too that the four stages of the temple-tower at Ur are in order, from the lowest to the highest, 9.75, 2.50, 2.30 and 4 meters in height. The entire structure conveys the general impres sion of a mountain, or even of a mountain complex of several peaks of varying heights. The first level, with the greatest height of all four stages, would represent, of course, the common base of all four peaks, while the fourth level, of a height surpassing considerably the two strata immediately beneath, would represent the highest peak of the complex. For evidence that this was conceived to be of an elevation towering far above the adjacent peaks, cf. below, note 198. But of even greater significance is the representation in no. 474 of what seems to be a temple-tower situated immediately upon the shore of the sea (not a river, as the salt-water crab in the water indicates), and with an elaborate garden of palm-trees at its side, for this reproduces some of the principal fea tures of Safon, situated at the end of the earth, at the edge of Tehom, with a garden of trees, bearing all manner of fruit, upon the summit of the highest peak. Furthermore, Eissfeldt (Baal Zaphon, Zeus Kasios mid der Durchzug der IsraelitenIsraeliten durchs Meer, 20, note 1) has called attention to the fact that the Babylonian temple-towers were usually oriented towards the northwest, i. e■ towards that very corner of the earth where, according to North Semitic my thology, Safon, or the complex of seven mountains of which Safon was the center, was located. In this too we may see further evidence of the basic rela tionship of the Babylonian zigguratu to this mythical complex of mountains (cf. also May, "The Patriarchal Idea of God," JBL, LX [1941], 123).</page><page sequence="58">58 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [58] way the throne-room of the temple.171 This conclusion is strength ened by the not infrequent comparison in Akkadian literature of the temple-tower to a mountain172 and by the figurative expres sion that the temple-tower reaches up to heaven.173 In one other significant respect the close mutual relationship of the Babylonian temple-tower and the complex of seven moun tains of 1 Enoch is apparent. The temple-tower is by no means conceived as the permanent abode of the deity to whom it is dedicated. Rather, he dwells ordinarily outside this sanctuary 11ל Cf. however, Herodotus, I, 183 and Gressmann, AOTB2, II, 135 f. This cell of the deity of the Babylonian seven-staged temple-tower would seem to correspond somewhat to the d'bir or adyton of the Phoenician-Israelite temple pattern, in which the image of the enthroned supreme deity stood (cf. "Amos Studies, III," HUCA, XV [1940], 105 ff.). I have shown elsewhere ("The Tent of Meeting," J AOS, 38 [1918], 139) that the d'bir was the artificial representation, in the Phoenician-Israelite temples, of the sacred cave of the deity of primitive pastoral Semitic religion. The origin of this concept must be sought in the desert. Its reinterpretation as the throne-room within the Israelite temples of Phoenician pattern must be the result of the reaction of more advanced, agricultural, syncretistic, religious concepts upon the more primitive, pastoral concept and practice. This new concept implies, of course, that, as one of the processes of this religious syncretism, the supreme deity had now come to be regarded as the divine king. This cultural evolution went hand in hand with the natural advance of early Semitic peoples from pastoral to agricultural civilization. This process is effectively illustrated by the transi tion in Israel from the simple tent-sanctuary which David, with his basically shepherd outlook, set up in Jerusalem, to the temple which Solomon erected, after the Phoenician pattern, approximately a half-century later, to supersede the old tent-sanctuary and, among other things, to symbolize the new cultural order (cf. "Amos Studies, III," 100-134). It is now self-evident that the post exilic, apocalyptic tradition of the elevation, upon the very last day, of the Temple Mount to become the highest mountain of the earth and the throne of Yahweh, as the universal divine King, not only represents the final stage in the transition from the primitive, pastoral concept of the sacred cave upon the mountain in the desert as the adyton of the deity, to the sacred mountain, the highest of the entire earth, as the throne of the supreme world-deity, but is also actually a return to the ancient North Semitic concept of Safon, the divine mountain. Manifestly, in the final outcome, the North Semitic agricultural concept triumphed over the primitive, desert, pastoral concept of the sacred place of the deity. 172 Cf., for example, the Nabopolassar inscription in KB, IV, 6-7, 11.23-25; also KB, IIP, 50-51, 1.11, note. 173 Cf. Tiglathpileser, VII, 87 (quoted from Delitzsch, HWB, 262b).</page><page sequence="59">[59] psalm 48 59 and enters it regularly only upon the annual New Year's Day. At least such was the procedure in the great temple of Marduk, Esagila, at Babylon, after it was restored and enlarged by Nebu kadnezzar II; for this king records that on the eighth and eleventh days of the New Year's festival Marduk, in his role as "King of the gods of heaven and earth" and "Lord of the gods," took his place within the Temple, while the gods of heaven and earth made humble obeisance before him and then stood before him in reverence.174 But precisely this must have been the pro cedure thought to obtain upon upon the summit of the highest peak of the complex of seven mountains of 1 Enoch. There is the throne of God, "where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, sits when He comes down to visit the earth with goodness."175 It is true that there is here no mention whatever of the New Year's Day as the occasion of the Deity's coming down to earth and seating Himself upon this throne, nor is there here any suggestion that upon this annual occasion He was attended by the gods of lower rank, who stood about Him reverently and rendered homage unto Him. But there can scarcely be any doubt that just this is the implication of this passage in 1 Enoch 25.3. This complex of seven mountains, with the divine throne upon the summit of the highest, central peak, at the precise northwest corner of the earth, plays exactly the same role in the mythology and religious concepts basic to this section of 1 Enoch as did the Babylonian temple-tower in the mythological and religious concepts of ancient Babylonia in the days of Nebukadnezzar II, and undoubtedly also in far earlier days. Of the close relationship of the Babylonian seven-staged temple-tower to the mythological complex of seven sacred moun tains at the northwest corner of the earth, and even of the development of the former out of the latter, there can scarcely be any doubt. But from this it would follow that, even though naught thereof be mentioned in 1 Enoch, this highest of the seven mountains, upon the summit of which was the throne of God, 1'יי The so-called "grosse Steinplatten-Inschrift" of Nebukadnezzar II, II! 54-62 {KB, III2, 14-15). 175 For this slight deviation from Charles' translation, cf. above, p. 51.</page><page sequence="60">60 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [60] upon which He would take His seat whenever He would descend to visit the earth with goodness, i. e. upon the annual New Year's Day, when the gods of inferior rank would stand about Him and render homage unto Him, must have been the har mo'ed,mo'ed, the mountain of assembly of the gods, of Isa. 14.13; must therefore have been Safon. There, upon each recurring New Year's Day, the supreme deity would sit enthroned, in the midst of the '"dat 'El, and take counsel with His fellow-deities and determine the lot of men and nations for the year just begin ning.1'6 That this supreme deity was originally El, the supreme deity of the ancient North Semitic pantheon, and that the ascrip tion of the role of supreme deity in this divine assembly to either Yahweh, Ellil17' or Marduk represents comparatively late developments therefrom, is self-apparent. 1יי Cf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 40 ff. 177 Very convincing corroboration of our thesis of the close relationship of the Babylonian temple-tower to the tradition, obviously ancient, of the complex of seven mountains, with the supreme deity enthroned upon the highest peak thereof, may be seen in the common designation of the Baby Ionian deity, Ellil, as Sadû rabû, "the great mountain"; cf. in particular the passages cited by Jensen (Kosmologie, 206-207); Sadû rabû Ellil bel mâtâti àSibàSib Éharsaggalkurkurra,Éharsaggalkurkurra, "Ellil, great mountain, lord of the lands, who dwells in Eharsaggalkurkurra" (the temple of Ellil at Nippur; literally "temple of the great mountain of the lands") (KB, II, 78-79,1. 175); sadu rabû Bel Imharsag Sa Sa resasu Samâme Sanna apsû ellim SurSudu ussuSu, "the great mountain, Ellil, mountain of heaven, whose peak reaches heaven, whose foundation is laid in the pure ocean (IV Rawlinson, 27, no. 2). In this last passage Ellil, as the Sadû rabû,Sadû rabû, "the great mountain," seems to be actually identified with the Baby Ionian Mt. Aralu, which, as we have learned (above, note 166), was thought to extend from the netherworld into heaven, and which was, as we will see, the Babylonian counterpart of §afon. Jensen (op. cit., 203 ff.) has tried earnestly but futilely to refute Delitzsch's contention that Harsaggalkurkurra, "the great mountain of the lands," was identical with the har mo'ed, "the mountain of assembly (of the gods)" of Ezek. 28.14, which also, as we will see, was the same as §afon. Jeremias (Das Alte Testament im Lichte des Alten Orients2, 565, 568, also 558) approves of this identification. And not only Ellil but also Ashur was occasionally hailed as Sadû rabû, while to Anu the title, Sadu ill, "mountain of the gods" was likewise given. But most significant of all for this study is the fact that a common title for MAR-TU, the god of the Westland, or Amurru, was KUR-GAL, "the great mountain" (cf. Diirr, Die Stellung des Propheten Ezechiel in der israelitisch-judischen Apokalyptik, 110 f.).</page><page sequence="61">[61] psalm 48 61 This identification of the complex of seven mountains at the northwest corner of the world, with the central and highest peak thereof the throne of the supreme deity, with Safon is confirmed by manifold biblical evidence. In Jer. 6.22; 31.7; 50.41 Safon, or the land of Safon, is located at the very edge of the earth, and obviously at the northern edge.178 Jer. 46.10; Zeph. 2.13 locate Safon, or the land of Safon, at the headwaters of the Euphrates, i. e. among the mountains of Armenia, the southern and southwestern projections of the Caucasus, and assign this territory, with general historical accuracy, to Assyria.17' From 18ל This is the implication of Amos 8.12 also (w. 11-12 are recognized by the vast majority of biblical scholars as not from Amos; they are most probably an interpolation from the post-exilic period; cf. the commentary to follow in a subsequent section of my "Amos Studies," in HUCA). The expression, miçsafonmiçsafon vf'ad mizrah, literally interpreted, "from north to east," is surprising indeed, both because east is not the natural and logical antithesis of north, and also because miyyam 'ad. yam, as usually interpreted, "from sea to sea," i. e. from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea," already implies a wandering in an easterly direction, so that w''ad mizrah seems to repeat unnecessarily and with weakening effect an idea already expressed adequately in the v. Moreover, the implication here is of a wandering in search of the word of the Deity in a range far wider than merely from one side of Palestine proper to the other, i. e. from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea. As Nowack has shown, miyyam 'ad'ad yam means from one end of the earth to the other, i. e. from the sea at one end of the earth to the sea at the other end (so also Zech. 9.10; Ps. 72.8; cf. Joel 2.20). A corresponding idea must be expressed in missafon w''ad mizrah■. Here too then Safon must indicate the northwestern corner of the earth, must be the name of the mountain which ancient North-Semitic mythology and later Jewish apocalyptic tradition located at that corner. "From Safon to the east" must mean accordingly from the western edge, or, more specifically, from the northwestern corner, of the earth to its far eastern edge. Precisely this journey was undertaken by Enoch himself (1 Enoch 24-33). 1יל Somewhat farther north lies the southeastern corner of the Black Sea, a consideration which may have played a quite significant role in the develop ment of the mythological background of the narrative in 1 Enoch 18.11-16, with the abyss, or Tehom, lying just beyond the seven mountains and chaos, or Tohu Wabohu, lying beyond Tehom (cf.

This reading would accord with the basic mythological picture more accurately than does the près ent reading.]). It may well be therefore that it was the geographical location of the Black Sea just beyond these ranges of the Caucasus Mountains which furnished the mythological pattern of Tehom lying just beyond $afon.

Within this district dwell different nations, separated from each other, no doubt because of the mountainous terrain, by varying distances (Jer. 25.26). Isa. 49.12; Jer. 3.18; 16.15; 23.8; 31.7; Zech. 2.10 imply clearly that it was to this section of the vast Assyrian Empire that the exiles of the Northern King dom were transported in and after 721 B.C. Ezek. 38.6, 15; 39.2 make Safon the cradle-land of Bet-Togarmah and the other bar barian nations whom Yahweh will send against Israel for their own eventual destruction. Isa. 41.25; Jer. 50.3,9,41 represent Safon as the country from which the nations, destined by Yah weh to overthrow the Babylonian Empire, viz. the Medes and Persians, will set out upon their fell task. Manifestly all these biblical passages locate Safon in the same district, in the moun tains of Armenia, and specifically in just that section thereof where not only the Euphrates, but also the Tigris, the Halys, the Araxes and other rivers have their sources.180 Viewed from 8.21 (cf. 9.5) locates the Black Sea to the north, just beyond the Mountains of Ashur, which, in turn, seem to be the western extension of the Mountains of Ararat. Magog is the country lying northeast of the sources of the Tînâ River, i. e. the Araxes, and extending to the Caspian Sea (Jub. 8.25; 9.8). 180 1 Enoch 77.4-7 speaks again of the seven mountains of the north (cf. above, note 158) and of the seven rivers (and not merely four, as in the bib lical narrative in Gen. 2.10-14) which rise in the vicinity of these mountains. These seven rivers may be identified with reasonable certainty as the Nile (cf. Charles' note to 77.5), the Euphrates, the Tigris (for the sanctity of the sources of both the Euphrates and the Tigris even today, cf. Albright, op. cit., 172; note also the epithet applied to El in the Ras Shamra literature [cf. Albright, "The North-Canaanite Poems of Al'eyân Ba'al and the 'Gracious Gods'," (JPOS, XIV [1934] IV, 21-22)], mbk. nhrn. qrb. 'apq. thmtm, "who causes the rivers to flow from the midst of the fountains of the two deeps." The reference may well be to the Euphrates and the Tigris and their respective sources, or, perhaps even better, to Lakes Urmia and Van); the Halys, the Yeshil-Irmak, the Araxes and perhaps the Oxus (cf. Delitzsch, Parodies, 33. This mythological tradition may well be basic to the figure employed in Jer. 47.2 of the stream rising in Safon and, as it flows along, becoming a mighty river which floods the entire earth). Moreover, the seas to be found in the cen־ tral section of this northern quarter of the earth may, as has just been sug gested, be identified with much probability with Lakes Urmia and Van. The garden of righteousness would lie then to the west of these seas, i. e. at the northwest corner of the earth, precisely where 1 Enoch 24.4 ff. (and also</page><page sequence="63">[63] psalm 48 63 the standpoint of Assyria, and especially of Assyria as a world empire, these mountains of Armenia marked the northern edge or boundary of the earth. Apparently, after the advent of the Medes and Persians upon the stage of history, in the last quarter of the seventh century B.C., the range of geographical vision expanded, and accordingly the location of Safon was pushed back slightly, somewhat farther to the north, and consequently closer to the Black Sea and the highest ranges of the Caucasus.181 Be that as it may, however, from the historical standpoint Safon, or the land of Safon, designated in the biblical literature of the eighth, seventh and sixth centuries B.C. a specific, geo graphic district at the extreme north, so that very properly Safon Safon could be employed in Hebrew in the general sense of ',north." Mythologically too Safon had its precise location, even though not determined by specific, geographic boundaries. It was still located in the far north; but now the far north played a signif icant mythological role. The mountains of Safon still marked the northern edge of the world, the place where both earth and heaven had their ends. Immediately beyond it lay the bor, the pit or abyss. In the version of the ancient North Semitic myth recorded in Isa. 14.12-15 Helel ben Shahar ascends to the very 70.3-4) locates it, even though not calling it specifically by this name (cf. how ever, 60.23). According to Gen. 3.24 the cherubim and the flaming, revolving sword are placed at the entrance of Eden on the east. This implies that the earth stretched on to the east of Eden, and that accordingly Eden was not located in the extreme east (so also Gen. 4.16; cf. Gunkel to 3.24). Jub. 4.26 distinguishes between the location of Eden and the sacred mountain of the east. Albright ("The Goddess of Life and Wisdom," AJSL, 36 [1919-20], 283, note 4) contends that not only the vineyard paradise of the goddess Siduri Sâbîtu (op. cit., 280) but also Eden were originally located in the northwest, in the mountains of Armenia, beyond the Masius range, and that only in secondary tradition did Eden come to be located in the extreme east (cf. 1 Enoch 32.3-6 and Charles' note; also Albright, "The Mouth of the Rivers," AJSL,AJSL, 35 [1918-19], 192). This transition must have taken place after the composition of Jubilees, i. e. after the last quarter of the second century B.C. The Rabbis too located Paradise in the north, while not a few of them located it more exactly in the northwest (cf. Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, III, 161; V, 13, note 33). 181 Cf. above, note 179.</page><page sequence="64">64 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [64] summit of Safon, in his attempt to seize the throne of El, only, in turn, to be toppled over and plunged into the very depths of the abyss, obviously lying just on the opposite side of Safon, immediately beneath the lofty throne of El.182 Safon here towers up into heaven so high that the throne of El is even above the stars. It is the har mo'ed, "the mountain of assembly" of the gods.183 Unquestionably it is identical with the highest of the seven mountains of 1 Enoch 18 and 24-25. Even more compelling proof of this identification is the description of the garden of wondrous trees upon the summit of the mountain, encircling the divine throne, with the tree of life among them. True, nowhere in these chapters is this garden called by the specific name, Eden. Yet that it must be identified with the biblical Eden is beyond all question. Albright184 has correlated this garden, with the tree of life within it, with the garden of Siduri-Sâbîtu, on the one hand, and with the biblical Eden, on the other hand. Particularly significant is the identifi cation of this garden upon the summit of Safon with the Eden of Ezek. 28.12-18, the garden of god, upon the summit of the sacred mountain of god,185 where, among precious stones186 of all description, dwelt the exalted cherub, whom, however, because of his iniquity and faithlessness, the Deity was compelled to cast out of the garden down to earth, where he was consumed by the fire which came forth from his own person.187 With this evidence 182 çf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 108 ff. 183 Op. cit., 40-76; cf. above, note 177. 184 "The Goddess of Life and Wisdom," AJSL, 36 (1919-20), 280-284. 18s Similarly 2 Enoch 8.3 tells that the tree of life is at the place where the Lord rests when He goes up into Paradise; cf. also Ginzberg, Legends, I, 97, 123. 186 'Abne 'es, no doubt identical with Akkadian aban issâti, literally "stones of fire"; cf. Delitzsch, Paradies, 118 f. 1Sj Obviously we have to do here with another version of the Helel ben Shahar-Satan myth (cf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 108 112). The final detail of the myth here, viz. that the rebellious cherub was cast down to earth and was there consumed by the flame which came forth from his own person cannot but remind us of Luke 10.18, "I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven." Impliedly even before the rebellious angel, cast out from heaven, reached the earth, the flame had sprung forth from his person and enveloped his entire body, and the work of his total destruction had begun.</page><page sequence="65">[65] psalm 48 65 the identification of the garden upon the summit of the highest of the seven peaks of 1 Enoch 18 and 24-25 with Eden, and with this of these seven peaks, and especially the highest among them, with the sacred mountain of God, i. e. with Safon, becomes indubitable. Of further significance is the statement of v. 13,188 that the cherub, who dwelt upon the sacred mountain amid the precious stones, filled his treasuries with gold. In the Akkadian records Aralû,189 the sacred mountain in the far north, was one of the two mountains from which gold came.190 But according to Job 37.22, From Safon cometh gold; upon God august it is an adorn ment.191 Safon too is a traditional source of gold, especially in mytho logical tradition, and from this angle too must therefore be 188 Following the unquestionably better text of G and 5 (cf. Bewer, in Kittel, Biblia Hebraica3). 189 Also the netherworld, the abode of the dead; cf. Albright, "The Baby Ionian Temple-Tower and the Altar of Burnt-Offering," JBL, XXXIX (1920), 137, and above, note 164. 190 Cf. Delitzsch, Paradies, 107 f. and 118, and Albright, op. cit.-, BASOR, no. 70 (April, 1938), 20, and "The Ancient Near East and the Religion of Israel," JBL, LIX (1940), 107. 191 There is no need to emend זהב to זהר (so Duhm, G. B. Gray, Beer and E. G. H. Kraeling), chiefly upon the basis of Ezek. 8.2, nor yet to drastically recast and reinterpret the v. with Buttenwieser. Quite the contrary, it would be far simpler and more natural and probable to follow the reverse procedure and emend זהר of Ezek. 8.2 to זהב on the basis of this passage and to conform to the parallel thought of k''eyn hafrasmal, "like the gleam of basmal-metal" (cf. also 1.27). Job. 37.22b seems to state that the august, radiant deity of Safon is adorned with gold, clad in shining gold, as it were. But this is precisely the picture of the radiant, gleaming kebod Yahweh, which comes from Safon, in Ezek. 1.4-28; 8.2; 10.18-19, as we will see. There is therefore no reason what ever for emending the text of Job 37.22 or of interpreting it other than in a perfectly literal manner. Herodotus (III, 116) seems to preserve a reminiscence of this mythological tradition of gold coming from the far north, i. e. from §afon or Mt. Aralû, where it was guarded by supernatural, semi-divine créa tures, corresponding to the cherubim of the Ezekiel passages. 1 Enoch 20.7 too knows of the cherubim in the garden upon the summit of the highest of the seven mountains.</page><page sequence="66">66 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [66] identical both with the Akkadian Mount Aralû and the sacred mountain of god of Ezek. 28.12-18. But Safon plays a further role, and one of extreme signifi cance, in the Book of Ezekiel in the remarkable vision in 1.4-28 and its attendant sections.192 For there the k'bod Yahweh comes from Safon. Its appearance is that of a man, gleaming with one kind of radiance from the waist upwards and with another kind of radiance from the waist downwards. It is seated upon a throne which stands upon a raki'a, i. e. a flat platform or dais,193 which in turn rests upon the heads of the four fyayyot. The throne was as if of sapphire. Obviously it is the same as the sapphire throne in 1 Enoch 18 and 24-25. But from this it follows once again that the highest, central peak of the seven mountains of 1 Enoch, upon which is the throne of the supreme deity, must be Safon itself, since, as v. 4 states explicitly, it is from Safon that the kebod Yahweh comes. Manifestly Ezek. 1.4 implies, just as does 1 Enoch 18 and 24-25, that Yahweh is the supreme deity, and that His normal abode, when He comes to visit the earth, is Safon.194 191 1.1, 4-28; 2.1; 3.12,113-13, 23a/3b; 8.2, 4; 10. The Ezekelian authorship of these passages I question seriously. (Likewise I cannot agree with Holscher that 1.4 is a part of the original vision of Ezekiel rather than the beginning of the interpolated vision of the divine throne, 1.4-28.) I regard these passages, together with chapters 40-48, as constituting a framework, chiefly apocalyptic or semi-apocalyptic in character, and not all necessarily the work of one author or of one age, which was gradually built about the original nucleus of the Book of Ezekiel circa 500-200 B.C. The strictly apocalyptic portion of this frame work has very close affinities with other apocalyptic passages of the Bible and even closer affinities with extra-biblical Jewish apocalyptic writings. Likewise with Holscher, I cannot regard all the remaining portions of the book as genu inely Ezekelian. In particular the greater portion of chapters 25-32 comes from the period following immediately upon 485 B.C., as I have intimated above (note 60), and as I hope to demonstrate in a subsequent study. 193 Like that upon which North-Semitic deities are frequently represented as standing or their thrones as resting; cf. Gressmann, Altorientalische Bilder zumzum A. T., nos. 318, 322, 323, 335, 336, 345. 194 Ezek. 1.4-28 seems then to indicate that the concept that Yahweh dwelt normally within the Temple at Jerusalem had not yet evolved at the time of its composition (cf. "The Book of the Covenant," I, HUCA, V [1928], 3939 ff.; "Amos Studies, I," HUCA, XI [1936], 134 ff.). This passage and its related sections (cf. above note 192) must be then the work of an apocalyptist</page><page sequence="67">[67] psalm 48 67 Still one other biblical narrative seems to deal with Safon, even though, once again, this name is not applied specifically to the mountain or mountains in question. The P version of the who lived in Palestine either at some time during the fifth century B.C., before the composition of P and the rise of the doctrine that Yahweh dwelt perma nently within the Temple, or else at a period somewhat later, but who be longed to one of the Hasidic groups or sects which did not accept the Zadokite theology and program of P. Moreover, Ezek. 1.4-28 seems to imply further that when Yahweh, for any reason, would journey from Safon to any other place on the earth, He would do so while still seated upon His sapphire throne, which would be borne along upon the fiayyot or cherubim, or however these divine creatures, the attendants of the Deity, might be called; hence the title, Yahweh Yahweh yohb hak'rubim; cf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 67 ff., note 69; cf. also Isa. 19.1; Ps. 18.11 ( = 2 Sam. 22.11); Dan. 7.13; Rev. 14.14-16; also the title, "rider of the clouds" (rkb 'arpt), in the Ras Shamra texts, applied to 'Al'eyan Ba'al. A graphic illustration of the Ezekelian concept of the divine throne, and also an indication of its firm and enduring appeal to the Jewish religious imagi nation, reaching well into the Middle Ages, may be seen in the title-page of the manuscript of the Mahzor, or Jewish Prayer Book, of the Breslau State and University Library, Ms. Or. I, 1 (cf. Rachel Wischnitzer-Bernstein, "The Messianic Fox," THE REVIEW OF RELIGION, 1941, 257-263, and espe cially the plate facing p. 260), dating from the first half of the fourteenth century. A.D. This title-page shows a representation of the Gate of Mercy, which, according to Jewish tradition, was opened on the Day of Atonement, but was closed again at sunset of that most holy day. As I have shown ("The Gates of Righteousness," HUCA, VI [1929], 1-37), this concept had its origin in the ancient ceremony of opening the eastern gate of the Jerusalem Temple, kept closed throughout the remainder of the year, upon the morning of the New Year's Day, the day of the fall equinox, so that the first rays of the rising sun might shine directly in through this open gate, down the long axis of the Temple, into the d'bir or holy of holies at its far western end. This was known as the coming of the k'bod Yahweh, the so-called "Glory of Yahweh," and sym bolized the entrance of the Deity into the Temple upon this "Day of Judg ment" in order to pronounce judgment upon Israel and fix its destiny for the year just beginning. At sunset of this day this eastern gate was again closed and remained closed tightly until the dawn of the next New Year's Day. Ps. 24.7-10 is undoubtedly a part of the liturgy of this occasion. It sum mons this eastern gate to open of its own accord that Yahweh, the radiant King, "the King of Glory," might enter. Undoubtedly Yahweh is here con ceived of in the form of the k'bod, Yahweh. But also in the vision of Ezekiel Yahweh is represented as the k'bod Yahweh, in the form of a man of radiant appearance, seated upon His sapphire throne and borne along by the four hayyot. Also in the complementary vision, in Ezek. 43.1-4, the prophet again</page><page sequence="68">68 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [68] flood story tells that the flood was caused by the opening of the windows of heaven and of all the sources of the great Tehom."5 The waters rose higher and higher until the tops of the very highest mountains were covered to a depth of at least fifteen cubits, just half the height of the ark.1'6 At the end of one hundred and fifty days, during which the waters had risen steadily, the ark stuck fast upon one of the mountains of Ara rat.1" The implication is clear that this mountain was the very beholds, and this time upon the New Year's Day (40.1), Yahweh, still in the form of the kebod Yahweh, just as He had beheld Him in the first vision, enter the restored Temple by the open eastern gate, to take up His permanent residence therein; therefore the supplementary command (44.1-2) that hence forth this eastern gate shall forever remain closed, impliedly because never again would Yahweh, now dwelling constantly within the Temple, have occa sion to enter therein. Manifestly it is just this entrance of Yahweh into the Temple through the open eastern gate, the Gate of Mercy, upon the Day of Atonement, origi nally the New Year's Day, which this title-page depicts. The two doors of the gateway are flung wide open. The arch of the gateway forms the framework of the picture. At the bases of the two sides of the arch and at their summits, just where the curve of the arch proper begins, the four hayyot are represented in four médaillons, while in another médaillon, inserted at the very keystone of the arch, the divine throne, in the form of a square-shaped, stately armchair, resting upon a platform, the raki'a of the picture of Ezekiel, is depicted. Quite naturally, in strict conformity with Jewish tradition, the chair or throne is empty. None the less the obvious implication is that Yahweh is seated thereon, though invisible to the human eye. That the basic theme of this title-page is the vision of Ezekiel is beyond question cf. also Burch, Anthropology and the Apocalypse,Apocalypse, SO, 62). It forms a fitting framework or setting for the central theme of the "Messianic Fox," symbolizing Israel's expectant hope of salva tion and restoration and of the rebuilding of the Temple, destined to be achieved, according to Jewish tradition, upon the New Year's Day. 195 I. e. the vast ocean, which not only lies underneath, but also extends beyond the ends of the earth, in other words, beyond §afon. 196 Gen. 6.15; 7.11-8.4 (in the main; cf. Gunkel to the passage). 197 Note the plural, hare 'Ararat; not "Mt. Ararat," as traditionally trans lated and interpreted, but rather "(one of) the mountains of Ararat," i. e. of Urartu or Armenia. According to Jub. 5.28 the ark was held fast upon the summit of Lûbâr, one of the mountains of Ararat. Quite probably these "moun tains of Ararat" may be identified broadly with the har're kedem, "the moun tains of antiquity" (not "the mountains of the east" [cf. Deut. 33.15, where harereharere kedem is in parallelism with gib'ot 'olam, "the eternal hills;" cf. also Hab. 3.6]), which marked the northern boundary of Aram Naharaim, the</page><page sequence="69">[69] psalm 48 69 highest of the entire earth, so much higher in fact than all other mountains that it needed more than two and one half months for the waters to abate sufficiently for the tops of the other moun tains to emerge.198 The full implication of the flood narrative199 now becomes plain. As the waters of the flood rose steadily, they swept the ark farther and farther to the north, until it reached the very end of the earth. But just as it was about to be swept beyond the confines of the earth, the appointed habitation of men, out home of Bil'am (cf. Num. 23.7; Deut. 23.5). The designation of these northern mountains as har're kedem or har're 'ad accords well with the significant role which, as we have seen, they play in North-Semitic mythology. 198 Gen. 8.5.. The biblical flood story enables us to form a clear picture of the vastly superior height of Çafon over all the other mountains of the earth, presumably including the six mountains immediately contiguous to it. Gen. 7.19 relates that the waters of the flood covered the highest mountains of the earth. 7.20, which, however, has all the earmarks of an interpolation, states that the waters covered the mountains to a depth of fifteen cubits, i. e. just half the height of the ark. The implication is, as Gunkel has pointed out (cf. Commentary to the passage), that the ark was floating in the water to half its height of thirty cubits (6.15), and so stuck fast upon the peak of the highest mountain, which we have identified with Çafon, at the very moment when the waters of the flood reached their zenith. The implication is further that, so soon as the ark had stuck fast, the waters began to recede. According to 8.3-5, after one hundred and fifty days of steady rise, upon the 17th of the seventh month, the recession of the waters began and continued steadily until the 1st of the tenth month, when the tops of the mountains, i. e. the mountains other than this one, particular peak, Çafon, emerged. This means a period of recession of the waters of either seventy-three or seventy-four days, depending upon the system of calendation here employed (cf. "Addi tional Notes on 'The Three Calendars of Ancient Israel'," HUCA, III [1926], 9494 f.). According to 8.13, the recession was completed and the waters had vanished from the face of the earth upon the 1st of the first month of the succeeding year. This implies in turn that it required exactly three months, totalling either eighty-eight or ninety days, for the waters to recede to the depth of the highest mountains other than §afon. The fact that these two periods of the recession of the waters were of almost equal duration implies, in turn, that Çafon was thought by this P author or editor to tower above all other mountains to almost twice the height of the very highest. The mytho 1 ogical character of §afon and of this element of the flood story is thus clearly established (cf. above, note 170). 199 In both the J and P versions; for in both, so it seems, the mountain upon which the ark landed played precisely the same role.</page><page sequence="70">70 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [70] beyond into the realm of Tehom, where it would have been irretrievably lost, Providence intervened, and the ark was caught upon the peak of the highest mountain of the entire earth, one of the mountains of Ararat, at the northern edge of the earth. This mountain, immeasurably higher than all other mountains, must have been Safon. And there, very properly, since the sum mit of this mountain was the actual spot upon which Yahweh would descend to visit the earth, and where therefore He could be most readily contacted by mortals, Noah offered sacrifice, and there Yahweh made a covenant with him.200 All this evidence, coming from various directions, establishes two important conclusions. The first is that the nameless range of seven mountains of 1 Enoch 18 and 24-25, having the form of a right angle, situated at the northwestern corner of the earth, at just the spot where both earth and heaven end, with the highest mountain of the seven at the apex of the right angle and reaching from earth into heaven, and with the sapphire throne of the supreme deity at its pinnacle, with this throne therefore still located in heaven even though at the same time actually resting on the earth as well, must be Safon. This moun tain or, perhaps more precisely, this range of seven mountains, played a conspicuous role in the religious and mythological tra dirions of the northern Semites and apparently was most inti mately related to the institution of the Babylonian, seven-staged zikkuratzikkurat or temple-tower. Moreover, it seems that this concept of this range of seven mountains at the northern or northwestern edge of the earth, with the highest peak thereof as the place where the supreme deity was enthroned, and where the atten dant deities were wont to assemble upon each recurring New 200 In the Akkadian flood-story Mt. Nisir played identically the same role. For its probable, traditional location to the northwest of Babylonia cf. Jensen, in KB, VI1, 382; Zimmern, KAT,549 ג, note 4; Albright, "The Mouth of the Rivers," AJSL, 35 (1918-19), 190 f. According to Gilgamesh-Epic, XI, 156 162, so soon as Ut-Napishtim came forth from the ship, he offered sacrifice upon the very highest peak of the mountain (ina eli zikfcurât sâdê). The gods smelt the sweet savor and quickly gathered like flies about the sacrifice, this quite naturally because this very mountain, and particularly this highest peak thereof (was it perhaps a mountain of seven peaks?), was their regular place of assembly on earth, the Akkadian har mo'ed.</page><page sequence="71">[71] psalm 48 71 Year's Day, to settle in council the destinies of men and nations for the year just beginning, was, if not in all, then at least in some of its most essential details, not of Semitic origin,201 and that it had its roots in the high Caucasus Mountains or, perhaps more precisely, in those offshoots of this mountain range which stretch to the south and southeast of the eastern or southeastern corner of the Black Sea. The Black Sea itself, extending for seemingly illimitable distances to the north and northwest of these mountains, may very well have suggested the concept of Tehom lying immediately beyond these mountains.202 In such a setting these mountains would very fittingly mark the northern edge or the northwestern corner of the earth, where heaven like wise ends, and beyond which lies Tehom, with Tohu or Chaos on the other side of Tehom. The second important conclusion which this array of evidence has established is that various elements of this ancient North Semitic mythology persisted in Israelite and Jewish thought and found frequent and varied expression in Jewish religious tradition and apocalyptic vision and speculation, particularly from the sixth century B.C. on and into the pseudepigraphic writings of the centuries immediately preceding the common era, and from these into Revelations and other kindred writings of early Chris tianity.203 We have encountered these North Semitic mytho logical elements not only in this study but also, and in great and varied profusion, in our study of "The Mythological Back ground of Psalm 82." The Book of Enoch, particularly in its older strata, seems to have been the repository of much of this mythological tradition, and that too in a form which approxi mated early stages of this tradition quite closely.204 201 Whether these details had their origin among the Sumerians or some other ancient people which streamed forth from the north into Mesopotamia and Syria, I do not feel myself competent to even discuss. 202 Albright {ibid.) has suggested that the mê mûti, "the waters of death," which must be crossed in order to arrive at the Isles of the Blessed, on their far side, may be identified with the Black Sea; cf. above, note 179. 2°ג Cf. in particular Burch, Anthropology and the Apocalypse. 20יי The significance of this material in the fascinating task of reconstruc tion of ancient North-Semitic mythology, religious concepts and institutions, so important especially in tracing the early history and gradual evolution of</page><page sequence="72">72 JULIAN MORGENSTERN 72] י] In one other biblical narrative the influence of the tradition of Safon may be readily discerned. Ex. 24.1-2, 9-11, 13b tells that at the command of the Deity Moses, accompanied by Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, ascended the mountain of revelation up to a certain point, and thére, from a distance, they beheld the God of Israel,205 and beneath His feet it was like a work of sapphire brick206 and like the very heaven for radiance. There these elect of Israel beheld the Deity in person, as it were, without incurring any danger to them selves,207 and while they ate and drank, presumably in the cele bration of a covenant meal with the Deity.208 Meanwhile Moses ascended the mountain of God,209 impliedly into the very près ence of the Deity. In the analysis and interpretation of this little narrative there has been much confusion and uncertainty. Dillmann as signed w. 1-2, 9-11 to J, while Holzinger and Carpenter and Harford likewise assigned vv. 1, 9-11 to J but regarded v. 2 as a gloss. Also in v. 1 Holzinger held that אהרון נדב ואביהוא and Judaism and Christianity, should not be underestimated. To me it seems to take its place rightfully alongside of Sanchuniathon, Berossos and other similar secondary sources, as indispensable supplements to and commentaries upon the primary sources, which we find in Akkadian literature, the Rash Shamra texts and the mythological representations upon the monuments of Mesopo tamia, and particularly of northwestern Mesopotamia. 2°s Or, following the text of G, "the place where the God of Israel stood." This text represents, no doubt, a harmonization of theological ideas rather than a correct original reading. 206 Or, perhaps better, "sapphire mosaic;" cf. Dillmann, to the passage. 20' From having gazed upon the Deity's person, which ordinarily meant death; cf. "The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch" (HUCA, IV [1927], 14 f.). Obviously this consideration motivates the detail of the narrative that these elders could ascend the mountain only to a certain point and might behold the Deity only from a distance (v.l); for it was this viewing the Deity from a distance, and not "face to face" (cf. Deut. 34.10), which ensured their safety. 208 So Dillmann and Baentsch to the passage. 205 V. 13b, unquestionably the expected and natural continuation of this narrative. Note that v. 13b disturbs the continuity of vv. 13a, 14-lSa (E?), for in v. 14 Moses has not yet begun the ascent of the mountain, but is still present with the elders (however, not the same elders as in vv. 1, 9) at the foot of the mountain; and likewise v. 15a records the ascent of the mountain by Moses in its proper sequence. V. 18a records the P version of the same incident.</page><page sequence="73">[73] psalm 48 73 מרחוק are glosses. Wellhausen, on the other hand, regarded these vv. as E, while Kuenen and Cornill, more specifically, set them down as El.210 Baentsch regarded vv. 1, 9-11 as E and v. 2 as redactorial. Eissfeldt assigns these vv. to L211 and holds, in turn, that as a part of L these vv. belong to the oldest literary stratum of the Hexateuch. None of these assignments carries conviction. They are all made largely upon the negative ground, that since, for this or that reason, these vv. cannot belong to one source, they must therefore be assigned to the other source. The only point of agreement among these various scholars seems to be that these vv. belong to one of the older, or even to the very oldest, of the strata of the Hexateuch. Actually these vv. should be correlated with Ex. 19.21 22, 25.212 There, it is clear, the Deity anticipates that the people will urgently desire to see Him, and also that certain of the priests are expected to draw near unto Him, and are therefore required to prepare themselves for this by ritual purification. In complete conformity to these expectations 24.1-2, 9-11, 13b tells that seventy elders, the natural representatives of the people,213 actually are permitted to see the Deity, even though only from a distance, and also that among them are the repre sentatives of the priestly caste, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu. Mani festly then 24.1-2, 9-11, 13b is the continuation of 19.21-22, 25. The entire passage shows traces of very late editorial handi work. With the exception of 24.10, where He is called 'Elohe Yisra'el,Yisra'el, and 24.13b where the mountain is called har ha'Elohim, the Deity is spoken of invariably as Yahweh. Moreover, the designation in 24.11 of the seventy elders as ,"Ale bene Yisra'el clearly anticipates, in characteristic editorial manner, the J nar rative in Num. 11.16-17, 24-30 and implies, furthermore, that these seventy elders here are the very same persons as the seventy 210 Cf. the tables in Holzinger, Einleitung in den Hexateuch. 211 211 I. e. his "Laiendokument." To this same stratum he likewise assigns vv. 13-15a. He too regards ואהרון נדב ואביהוא in vv. 1 and 9 and also משרתו in v. 13 as glosses, while, on the other hand, in v. 15a he inserts ויהושע after משה. 212 Though 24.1-2 is hardly the immediate continuation of 19.21-22, 25. 213 Therefore the provision in 24.2b that only the seventy elders, the repre sentatives of the people, but not the people themselves, are to ascend the mountain.

Manifestly this reference to these seventy elders comes entirely too early here; but, since they play an integral and indispensable role in this narrative, this definitely stamps this entire narrative as of secondary and late composition. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the influence of P is even more marked in this narrative than that of J. This is evidenced not only by the use of the characteristic P expres sion, 'esem, in v. 10, but also by the role which Aaron, Nadab and Abihu play in the narrative. While it is true that they are not mentioned specifically in v. 11, and so by implication are included in the collective term, '"sile bene Yisra'el, the reference to them in 19.22 indicates that they had some particular part in this narrative in its full form, whatever this may have been, and that therefore the citation of them in 24.1 cannot be a gloss, as, as we have seen, a number of biblical scholars have regarded it. Nadab and Abihu are mentioned otherwise only in P; and just as this narrative seems to anticipate the J narrative of the seventy elders in Num. 11, so also it seems to anticipate the P narrative in Lev. 10.1 ff. The evidence is cumulative therefore that this entire passage is actually neither J nor E nor L nor even P, but is altogether of secondary and late composition.214 It must be later even than the P narrative in Lev. 10.1 ff., the account of the death of Nadab and Abihu, and therefore cannot be much earlier than 400 B.C., and may even be a bit later. It comes then from the very period in which, as we have seen, the influence of North Semitic my thology was strong in late biblical and early pseudepigraphic writings. It need not surprise us therefore to find that in this late version of the revelation of the Decalogue the mountain of revelation should be designated as "the mountain of God" and should be invested with some of the attributes of Safon, partie ularly the sapphire throne of the Deity, or rather the platform, the raki'a, beneath it,215 and the shining radiance of heaven. This picture, even on the surface, differs but little from that in 214 Its closest affinities seem to be with P, for 19.23-24, embedded between vv. 22 and 25, are obviously Ρ or RP, while 24.15b-18 (omitting v. 18a!S) is the Ρ version of this same narrative. 2־s Of Ezek. 1.22 ff.</page><page sequence="75">[75] psalm 48 75 Ezek. 1.4-28. This narrative, or, more precisely, this fragment of a narrative, does not imply at all that this "mountain of God," this mountain of revelation in the desert, was the normal dwel ling-place on earth of the Deity. Rather, just as does the P ver sion of the same narrative, immediately following,216 it implies that the Deity had come from wherever His normal abode was conceived to be and had taken His place temporarily upon the summit of this desert mountain merely in order to make His revelation to Israel. And just as the P version of this narrative tells that the Deity came in the fiery form of the kebod Yahweh, characteristic of P, so this version, less disturbed in its theological principles by an anthropomorphic concept of the Deity, told that He came from His normal abode to the summit of this moun tain in the form of a fiery, radiant being seated upon His sapphire throne, which, in turn, rested upon a sapphire dais. But this is precisely the same picture as in Ezek. 1.4-28. Manifestly then the place from which Yahweh came to this mountain of revela tion must have been Safon, just as in the vision of Ezekiel. Naught is said here about the manner of transportation of this sapphire throne with the Deity seated upon it; but it is reasonable to believe that the full narrative, in its original form, before being edited by P writers, told, again just as in Ezek. 1.4-28, that it was borne along by cherubim.217 Quite naturally 216 Vv. 15b-16a; cf. "Biblical Theophanies" (Ζ/1, XXV [1911], 149 f.), but modifying the view there expressed, that Ρ conceived of Sinai as the normal earthly abode of Yahweh, before He took up His permanent residence within the tabernacle. Unquestionably in v. 16a wayiskon and way'kassehu must be interpreted as pluperfects; and the clear implication is that only seven days previously Yahweh had come from wherever His normal abode was, and had taken His place upon the summit of Sinai in preparation for this very moment of revelation to Israel. Actually this is stated, though rather confusedly, in Ex. 19.16a7 (וענן כבד על־ההר) and 18a/3, both passages obviously RP interpola tions. Even in Ρ something of the old mythological concept is apparent; for it is impossible to dissociate completely the Ρ picture of the k'bod Yahweh in the form of a consuming fire upon the summit of the mountain (v. 17) from the statement of 1 Enoch 18.6,10, that the place of the seven mountains burned day and night, while upon the summit of the highest peak, where the sapphire throne stood, was a flaming fire; cf. also Deut. 4.11b-12a. 21ל For the prevalence of this concept in the biblical writings of the early post-exilic period cf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 40, note 25; 69, note 69; 70, note 74.</page><page sequence="76">76 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [76] the figures of the cherubim tended to be suppressed by these P editors in conformity with their firmly established theological antagonism to the concept of angels, while their equally pro nounced anti-anthropomorphism made them remove all refer ence to the visible form of the Deity and even to the throne, and so left only the vague reference to the sapphire dais beneath the Deity's feet. That the original narrative, of which merely this little fragment has survived, comes from approximately the same period as Ezek. 1.4-28, or very soon thereafter, seems almost certain. It evidences a definite tendency in the thought of the post-exilic period to identify the various mountains of Israelite and Jewish tradition with Safon and to invest them with various of the mythological qualities and attributes of Safon.218 Quite 218 The spot where the seventy elders halt, beyond which they are not permitted to ascend, but from which they can get a clear view of the Deity, standing, or seated upon His sapphire throne, in either case, however, with His feet resting upon the sapphire dais, at the very summit of the mountain, might very well have been the summit of one of the six other peaks of Safon, perhaps the highest of these six and therefore the one closest to the central and dominating peak. Certainly from the top of this sixth peak a clear, unbroken view of the summit of the neighboring, highest peak, with the Deity enthroned upon it, could be obtained. Rather significantly Jub. 8.19 tells that Mount Sinai, as the center of the desert, Mount Zion, as the center, or the navel, of the earth, and the Garden of Eden, as the holiest place of the entire earth, the dwelling-place of the Lord, faced each other, formed a triangle, as it were. In one other, illuminating respect Mt. Sinai came to be endowed in popular tradi tion with the attributes of §afon; for the Rabbis told, and this tradition finds record likewise in the Koran (Suras 2:60; 4:153), that at the moment of revela tion Mt. Sinai was elevated above the heads of the children of Israel, gathered at its base, so that, whereas it was normally a mountain of no great height, it now became a mountain of extraordinary elevation, just as, as we have seen, was to be the divine procedure with Zion on the last day (cf. Ginzberg, Legends of of the Jews, III, 202; Obermann, "Koran and Agada: The Events at Mount Sinai," AJSL, LVIII [1941], 34 ff.). It is not at all improbable, not only that, as Obermann suggests, this tradition may be based upon a too literal interpréta tion of the statement of Deut. 4.11a, that the people stood 'beneath' the moun tain, but also, as the continuation of the v. states explicitly, at the moment of revelation "the mountain was flaming with fire into the very heart of heaven," that the tradition, that at this moment and for this occasion Sinai was elevated until it actually touched heaven, is implied in the v., and so was current already in the post-exilic period, when Deut. 4.11 was written. This would constitute then another point of identification of Sinai with the mythological Safon.</page><page sequence="77">[77] psalm 48 77 similarly Ps. 68.16 can say of Mt. Hermon, "The Mountain of Bashan is a mountain of humps;21' the Mountain of Bashan is the Mountain of God.220 219 Literally perhaps "a hunchbacked mountain," so designated because of its three peaks of slightly varying height (therefore perhaps the plural, hafyer monim,monim, Ps. 42.7); cf. Baedeker, Palestine and Syria5 (1912), 294; G. A. Smith, The The Historical Geography of the Holy Land, 477, note 1. 220 Also to the author of 1 Enoch 6-16, a portion of one of the oldest strata of the book (cf. Charles' introduction, op. cit., 170), Mt. Hermon must have been invested with various of the attributes of Çafon (cf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 88, 97). For, since the rebellious angels are repre sented as imprisoned in the hollows and valleys at its base, since, in other words, here was the abyss or pit, it would seem to follow that this writer imag ined that the divine throne, upon which the Deity would sit, when He de scended to visit the earth with goodness, and where on each recurring New Year's Day He held solemn council with His attendant deities, was located upon the summit of Hermon. Naturally the tree of life, planted among the fragrant trees near to the throne of the Deity, upon the summit of Hermon, would be conceived of as a cedar, just as in Ps. 92.15, as we will soon see, rather than as a palm, as in 1 Enoch 24.4 (cf. below, note 225). Precisely this concept of Mt. Hermon seems basic to and suggests the full implication of 2 Ki. 19.23 ( = Isa. 37.24). There the king of Assyria is repre sented as saying, "With the multitude of my chariots I ascended the highest mountain (note that harim has no article; therefore the full term, m'rom harim, probably has much the force of a proper name, i. e. Hermon), to the uttermost recesses (or "to the highest point"; for these two closely related connotations of yark'te cf. below, in this same note) of Lebanon; and I cut down its highest cedars, its choicest firs; and I came to the high place (so Isa. 37.24; 2 Ki. 19.23 reads m'lon, "the lodging-place," undoubtedly a corruption) at its very end, to the forest of its garden." The reference is undoubtedly to Mt. Hermon, for it is the highest peak of Lebanon. The v. envisages Hermon with many of the chief attributes of §afon, particularly the highest point at its very end or edge, with the garden of trees upon it. Apparently this particular spot was regarded as of the most extreme sanctity, for his entrance into it and his cutting down of the sacred trees there are represented, in the words attributed to the Assyrian king, as acts of utmost daring, which, carried out successfully and without any retributive misfortune befalling him, establish beyond all question the superiority of his power to that of the deity of this holy place and, im pliedly, of the deities of all the peoples conquered by him. (Perhaps too in v. 24 we have a somewhat obscured reference to the rivers which, according to the general myth, flowed forth from Eden, upon Safon; cf. Gen. 2.10-14; 1 Enoch 77.4-7 and above, note 180.) Likewise the author of Ezek. 31.15-18 seems to have associated both the garden of Eden and the abyss or pit with Lebanon. In "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82" (108-111) I followed</page><page sequence="78">78 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [78] Eissfeldt (Baal Zaphon, Zeus Kasios und der Durchzug der Israeliten durchs Meer,Meer, 14-16; also Bauer, "Die Gottheiten des Ras Schamra," ZAW, X [1933], 87; Albright, "The North-Canaanite Epic of 'Al'eyan Ba'al and Mot, JPOS, XII [1932], 192; Gaster, "Some Ancient Oriental Folklore," Folk-Lore, XLIX [1938], 338 f."; " 'Ba'al Is Risen ':An Ancient Hebrew Passion-Play from Ras Shamra-Ugarit," Iraq, VI [1939], 110, 116, 122 [Gaster holds also that Mt. Carmel too corresponds to Safon; ibid., 122]; Burch, Anthropology and the Apoc alypse,alypse, 132 f.) in not only identifying Mt. Casios with Çafon, but also in regard ing it as the true and original §afon of North Semitic mythology. As the result of this present study, however, I must now reject the latter assumption and regard the identification of Mt. Casios with Safon in the literature and religious thought and practice of Ugarit as but another instance of the very same prac tice which, a thousand or more years later, likewise identified various other mountains of the northwest Semitic world with §afon. The true and original Safon of North Semitic mythology, the elements of which may, no doubt, be traced backwards to an early period, antedating the Ras Shamra literature by another thousand years and more, must in all likelihood, as we have endeav ored to show, be located much farther to the north than Ugarit and Mt. Cas ios, in the Caucasus Mountains, and particularly in the range thereof which borders upon the southeastern corner of the Black Sea. This conclusion is confirmed by the popular connotation of safon in Hebrew, viz. "north"; for, had Mt. Casios been the original Safon, then to many of the little states of Northern Syria, with which the Israelites came into not infrequent contact in the course of their history, Yaudi for example, or Arpad or Kalneh, safon would have meant "west," or even "southwest"; and had this been the case, then to Israel too, certainly well acquainted with sections of Syria which lay quite far north of Mt. Casios, safon could scarcely have acquired the connota tion, "north" (so also Obermann, "An Antiphonal Psalm from Ras Shamra," JBL,JBL, LV [1936], 22). The solution of the problem implicit in all this is comparatively simple. Quite naturally the various little political units of the North Semitic world, for the most part, especially in Syria and Palestine in the period before the rise of the Israelite and Aramaean kingdoms, small, independent city-states like Ugarit, identified the "mountain of assembly" of the gods each with its own sacred mountain. With this, almost of necessity, and regardless of whatever the actual, local name of that sacred mountain may have been, each city-state linked the concepts and names basic to the myth itself, viz. "mountain of as sembly," "mountains of El" and §afon, therewith and localized thereon the setting and dramatic action of the original myth, of course with all the inevit able variations therein incidental to shifting of location and passage of time. In this way the name, Safon, came in time to be attached to various sacred mountains, not only to Casios but also to the hillock upon the eastern border of Egypt (Ex. 14.9; cf. Eissfeldt, op. cit.), and ultimately to the Temple Mount. Other sacred mountains, Hermon for example (cf. Dussaud, "Le mythe de Ba'al et d'Aliyân d'après des documents nouveaux," RHR, CXI [1935], 25,</page><page sequence="79">[79] psalm 48 79 who likewise questions the correctness of Eissfeldt's identification of Mt. Casios as the true and original Safon, and is inclined to regard the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountains, and Hermon in particular, rather than Casios, as furnishing the setting for much of the mythology of the Ras Shamra litera ture. In this connection it may be noted that, according to Sanchuniathon [cf. Cory's Cory's Ancient Fragments (ed. Hodges, 1876}•, 5], Lebanon and Anti Lebanon were regarded by the Phoenicians as mountains of a sanctity like that of Casios and Brathu [=Tabor; cf. Eissfeldt, op. cit., 12 f.]), or Sinai, as we have seen, even though apparently not called Safon explicitly, were none the less endowed with many of the qualities and attributes of the original, mythological Çafon. The assumption that this concept oÇthe central mountain within the com plex of seven mountains as the throne of the supreme deity of the North Semitic pantheon, located in the farthest north, or, more precisely, at the very northwest corner of the earth, is the original and basic form of this myth, and that its association with Mt. Casios is but the local Ugaritic form thereof, may find further corroboration in the term, oft recurring in the Ras Shamra texts, srrtsrrt spn. Albright ("The North Canaanite Epic of 'Al'êyân Ba'al and Mot," JPOS,JPOS, XII [1932], 192) correlates the term, srrt, with the Akkadian surru, "heart, interior." Obermann (op. cit., 26, note 11) holds that the basic meaning of the term is "mount, hill, height;" but, while apparently admitting the pos sibility of its identification with the Hebrew sur, none the less he prefers to link the term etymologically with the stem $hr, as used in both Hebrew and Arabic. Eissfeldt (op. cit., 4 and note 6) suggests more positively that srrt is the plural of a noun corresponding to the Hebrew sur, "mountain" (cf. Ex. 33.22 and "The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch," HUCÂ, IV [1927], 17; Num. 23.9; Jer. 18.14; Job 14.10; 24.8). Accepting this interpretation as the most plausible, then srrt spn, "the mountains of Safon," might very well be the entire traditional complex of seven mountains, of which Safon is itself the central and highest peak. Thus interpreted the srrt spn would be synonymous with the mryn spn, "the heights of Safon," upon which was the throne of 'Al'eyan Ba'al (cf. Bauer, op. cit., 87; Albright, "The North-Canaanite Poems of 'Al'êyân Ba'al and the Gracious Gods," JPOS, XIV [1934], 120 f.). However, whichever etymological interpretation of the term, $rrt $pn, be correct, it seems justifiable to equate the term with the biblical yark'te Safon. Moreover, if the biblical term may be linked with the common word, yarek, "side; flank," then perhaps the yarkHe Safon, "the sides or flanks of Safon," may designate primarily the six mountains, which were, in the most literal sense, the sides or flanks of Safon. (However for another, and perhaps more probable, etymological interpretation of yark'te Safon see below in this note.) But in any case, since in the topography of Mt. Casios there seems to be no thing whatsoever which might suggest a complex of seven mountains, since it is definitely a mountain of a single, outstanding peak, as its modern name, JebelJebel 'el-'Afrra', "the bald mountain," suggests (this name probably implies too that the top of Casios is bare, without any trees, another significant respect in</page><page sequence="80">80 JULIAN MORGENSTERN . [80] But quite naturally it was the Temple Mount which was in Jewish thought and literature most frequently identified with Safon or invested with the qualities and attributes of Safon. which it would fail to conform to the full pattern of the mythological §afon), we may see in this consideration additional evidence that the myth of the "mountain of assembly" of the gods, consisting of a complex of seven moun tains, situated at the very northern edge of earth and sky, upon the shore of the vast Tehom, was not associated originally with Mt. Casios, but rather was applied to this mountain only in the local, Ugaritic form of the myth, with its manifold ramifications, in quite the same manner as it was applied to other sacred mountains or mountain complexes of the Semitic world, some of them, at least so far as general topography was concerned, corresponding much more closely than Mt. Casios to the basic pattern of a complex of seven mountains (so also Obermann, op. cit., 28). Actually from its quite possible etymological relationship to Akkadian arkâtu,arkâtu, "the back side; the rear," it might seem that yark'te Safon may have connoted also "that which was behind or at the rear edge of Safon," i. e. the place where both heaven and earth were no more, the boundary line, as it were, between earth and heaven, on the one side, and the abyss or Tehom, on the other. In this connection note should be taken again of the explicit statement of 2 Ki. 19.23 ( = Isa. 37.24) that the Assyrian king found the highest point of the sacred mountain, with its forest which he ventured to cut down, at the farthest end or edge of the mountain. From this it would be but a simple step to the secondary meaning of yark'te, viz. "the end, or the extreme, or deepest, or innermost point" (cf. Ex. 26.22; 36.27; 1 Sam. 24.4; Jer. 6.22; 25.32; 31.7; Ezek. 32.23; Amos 6.10; Jonah 1.5; Ps. 128.3). Not improbably too in this meaning of yark'te, "end; extreme point," and in the location of the mytholog ical yark'te Safon at the very edge or end of the earth, upon the border of Tehom, we may, with Eissfeldt {op. cit., 38 f.), find the explanation of the name, Casios, viz. that Casios = kaseh, "end," and is therefore actually a syno nym of yark'te (Safon); for in such case the name, Casios, "end," would have been suggested by the location of this mountain at the very edge of the sea. This would also accord perfectly with the etymological interpretation of the name, Safon, proposed by Obermann (op. cit., 22), a derivative from the root, safaw,safaw, and a synonym of miçpeh, i. e. "watch-tower, watch-point," "Lookout Mountain" in other words. In biblical literature the specific term, yark'te Safon, seems to be used as a proper noun (Ezek. 38.6; 39.2 [contrary to Eissfeldt, op. cit., 22 f.] ; cf. Jer. 6.22; 31.7; 50.41), the customary name for the mythological complex of seven mountains at the northwestern corner of earth and sky, the throne of the supreme god, and therefore identical with the har're 'El, "the mountains of El" (Ps. 36.7), whose foundations reach so deep, and which therefore stand so firm, that very properly Yahweh's integrity (pdfcat'ka) may be likened to them.</page><page sequence="81">[81] psalm 48 81 We have seen221 that a not uncommon motif in apocalyptic specu lation was that the Temple Mount, actually but little, if at all, higher than its neighboring peaks, was destined by Yahweh to be elevated, so that it would become the highest mountain of the entire earth, the center of the religious aspiration and pilgrimage of all nations and the fitting site for Yahweh's throne, when He would come upon the last day to judge all men and nations. A motif closely related to this is that recorded in 1 Enoch 25.4 ff., viz. that on this last day the tree of life will be transplanted from its original location, upon the highest of the seven mountains, in the immediate vicinity of the divine throne, to the holy place, the Temple of the Lord, upon the Temple Mount at Jerusalem, now become the highest mountain of the entire earth, the new Safon as it were. Here the fruit of the tree of life will be given to the righteous for food, so that from their eating of it length of life, in happiness and peace, may be granted to them as their reward. This very same apocalyptic expectation finds expression in Ps. 92.13-15: The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; Like the cedar on Lebanon he shall grow. Transplanted222 to the house of the Lord, In the courts of our God shall they flourish ; Still in old age shall they bear fruit; Vigorous and verdant shall they be. The reference in vv. 14-15 is primarily to the palm and cedar; only in v. 16 does the Psalmist return specifically to the righteous of v. 13.223 In vv. 14-15 it is the palm and the cedar quite as much as the righteous, which are to be transplanted to the Temple courts, there to continue to flourish, so that still in old age, just as the cedar will be vigorous and verdant and the palm will bear fruit, so also will the righteous. These are not at all the ordinary 231 Above, pp. 47 ff. 333 For satal in the connotation, "to transplant," as well as "to plant," cf. Ezek.Ezek. 17.8, 10, 22, 23; 19.10. 33ג Note that in v. 13 the two verbs are in the singular, with sadik as their subject, while in w. 14-15 all four verbs are in the plural, obviously with tamar and 'erez understood as their subject.</page><page sequence="82">82 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [82] palm and cedar, the species in general. Rather, the idea basic to this passage is the same as that of 1 Enoch 25.4 ff., viz. that on the last day the tree of life is destined to be transferred to the Temple at Jerusalem, where Eden or Paradise will then be located. There the righteous and pious will be gathered and, as a part of their reward, they will be given the fruit of the tree of life as food, with the result that their existence will be prolonged immeasurably, and their physical powers will be perpetuated.224 This thought is not mentioned specifically, but unquestionably it is definitely implied, in Ps. 92.13-16. The tree of life is here represented both as a palm, as in 1 Enoch 24.4, and as a cedar. Both concepts were current in Semitic mythological literature.225 This motif of the transfer, upon the last day, of the garden of Eden, the garden of God, with both the tree of life and the divine throne in it, from its original location upon Safon, to the new Safon, the Temple Mount, and specifically to the courts of the "4 One of the effects of the prolongation of the life-span and perpetuation of the physical powers of the righteous will be that they will have numerous progeny and posterity and will, of course, live to behold them all and enjoy their companionship (cf. Charles' introduction to 1 Enoch, par. lia op. cit., 184); just this is, of course, the import of Ps. 92.13-16, that just as the palm and the cedar, so also the righteous in their old age, spent in Eden in the Tern pie courts, will be vigorous and verdant and will bear fruit. It is this condition of longevity and retention of physical powers by the righteous, rather than the praise of God which may spring from their lips, which, according to v. 16, will demonstrate convincingly that Yahweh is truthful, that there is no duplic ity in Him, and that He keeps His word and rewards the righteous as they deserve.

Albright, "The Mouth of the Rivers," AJSL, 35 (1918-1919), 176-185; "The Goddess of Life and Wisdom," AJSL, 36 (1919-1920), 283; also May, "The Sacred Tree on Palestine Painted Pottery," JAOS, 59 (1939), 251-259. The representation of the tree of life as a palm may perhaps be re garded as of southern origin, the result of the reworking, in a southern and truly Semitic environment, of the original, northern, and perhaps non-Semitic, concept of the tree of life as a cedar. This latter concept would naturally be native to a northern environment, and particularly to one of the mountains or mountain ranges, such as the Amanus or the parallel ranges even farther north (cf. Delitzsch, Parodies, 101-107; Albright, op. cit.). That in Ezek. 17.1 10, 22-24 the sacred tree is represented as a cedar evidences clearly that the mythological concept underlying this picture came to Israel from the north, in this particular case, as v. 3 indicates, from the Lebanon district.</page><page sequence="83">[83] psalm 48 83 Temple, there to be the abode and place of reward of the right eous, found quite frequent expression both in prophetic writings and in later apocalyptic speculation and literature.226 Manifestly it went hand in hand with the concept of the elevation of the 126 Cf. Isa. 60.21-22; 61.3; Ezek. 17.22-24. According to Rev. 22.1-3 the river of life, with the tree of life on both its banks, flows forth from the divine throne, situated in the heavenly Jerusalem, into which the garden of righteous ness has been transformed. The new Jerusalem descends from heaven upon a mountain great and high (21.10; cf. Syb. Or. V, 247-255). This is obviously the Temple Mount, now elevated upon this, the last, day, just as Isa. 2.2 and Mic. 4.1 foretold (cf. also 4 Ezra 13.6, 36), to be the highest mountain of the entire earth. The heavenly Jerusalem is perfectly square in shape, and is ori ented squarely to the four cardinal directions (Quite similarly the four corners of the Babylonian temple-tower at Ur were oriented precisely to the four cardinal directions; cf. Gressmann, AOTB,2 II, no. 663 and p. 189), and has twelve gates, three on each side (w. 12-13). It is located impliedly in the exact center of the earth (cf. Ezek. 5.5; 38.12; Syb. Or. V, 247-255), and is the microcosm, of which the earth itself, as depicted in 1 Enoch 33-36, is the macrocosm. Obviously then, according to Rev. the mountain of God, §afon, with the garden of righteousness surrounding the divine throne and with the tree of life within the garden, has been transferred to the Temple Mount, pre cisely as 1 Enoch 25.5-6 announces. Moreover, as Rev. 22.14-15 states, it has become the abode of the righteous, while the wicked and impious, destined for punishment, are excluded just outside its gates. This same concept is, of course, basic to Ezek. 47.1-12. There too the river of life issues forth from within the Temple, situated upon a very high mountain (40.2; 43.12; cf. Joel 4.18b; Ps. 46.5; 1 Enoch 26.1-3). Upon both its banks is the tree of life, together with the other trees of the garden, whose leaves do not wither, and whose fruits are for food and healing, and thus im pliedly confer length of life upon all those who are privileged to dwell in the garden, unquestionably the righteous and elect. Manifestly we have here another and a quite graphic record of the tradition recorded in 1 Enoch 25, of the transfer, upon the last day, of the divine throne, with the tree of life nearby and the garden of righteousness surrounding it, from its original loca tion upon §afon, far to the north, to the Temple Mount at Jerusalem, and the elevation of this to be the highest mountain of the earth (cf. also Rev. 2.7; Testament of Levi, 18.11; Targum [both Yerushalmi and "Fragmententar gum"] to Gen. 3.24; also Ginzberg, Legends, V, 105, note 96; Charles, Escha tology,2tology,2 290 f.). According to Albright ("The Mouth of the Rivers," AJSL, 35 [1918-1919], 191), already in the religious concepts of Babylonia in the third millenium B. C. the garden of the supreme deity upon the summit of Mt. Aralû in the far north was the abode after death of the kings, the elect of men, the obvious forerunners of the righteous in later Judaism.</page><page sequence="84">84 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [84] Temple Mount upon the last day, with all its attendant cir cumstances.227 ז־נ Not at all improbably this apocalyptic expectation of the sudden eleva tion of the Temple Mount upon the last day (cf. also Syb. Or. V, 247-255) must be linked with the eschatological tradition of the great earthquake which is also to happen upon this day (cf. above, note 154). The sudden elevation of the Temple Mount would be one of the chief effects of the earthquake. But another corresponding effect would be the enlargement of the Valley of Hin nom and consequently the opening up of a vast abyss in front of the Temple Mount. Whereas Zech. 14.6-10 seems to refer to the transfer of the garden of the Lord from the far north, with the tree of life and the throne of God in it (notice in v. 8 the reference to the stream of living waters flowing forth from Jerusalem upon this day [cf. note 226]; notice also the reference to the en thronement of Yahweh upon this day as sole king of the entire universe), w. 4-5 describe in graphic detail the splitting of the Mount of Olives and the extension of the Valley of Hinnom, so that it should reach to the very edge of the Temple Mount (reading גי־הנם for גי הרים and אצלו for אצל in v. 5; cf. Proksch in Kittel, Biblia Hebraica3). Moreover, while not specifically stated, the general idea of w. 4-10 seems to be that, just as on the last day the garden of God would be translated from the original Safon, in the far north or northwest, to the Temple Mount, the new §afon, so also would the abyss, the bor or Sheol, likewise be translated at the same time. And just as originally the bor lay on the far side and at the very foot of $afon, so now would the new abyss lie at the very foot of the new $afon, the Temple Mount, in other words, in the Valley of Hinnom (cf. 1 Enoch 90.26; also chapters 26-27 and Burch, Anthropology and the Apocalypse, 131 ff.). Thus it came about that in both Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature the Valley of Hinnom, or Gehenna, came to be regarded as the great abyss and the place of waiting or of punishment of the wicked (cf. 1 Enoch 26.4-27.3; 4 Ezra 7.36-38), with the resultant and not infrequent confusion of the Valley of Hinnom, or Gehenna, with the original abyss beyond the northern end of the earth. Quite naturally too later Jewish tradition came to tell that one of the three entrances to the netherworld lay in this Valley (Ginzberg, Legends, V, 19, note 55). It is not at all improbable that the practice of burning children as sacrifices in the Valley of Hinnom, so common in the pre-exilic period (cf. Eissfeldt, MolkMolk als Opferbegriff im Punischen und Hebrdischen und das Ende des Gottes Moloch),Moloch), may have contributed not a little to this eschatological identification of the Valley of Hinnom with the mythological fiery abyss of the far north. Obviously a corollary to this apocalyptic doctrine, if such it may be called, of the transfer on the last day of both the garden of God and the abyss lying at its foot from their original location at the northern end of the earth to Jerusalem, its center, with the garden on the Temple Mount to become the abode and place of reward of the righteous and the enlarged abyss in the Valley</page><page sequence="85">[85] psalm 48 85 From all this evidence it is clear that from about the end of the sixth century B.C. on there was a positive tendency in Jewish circles to identify various sacred mountains of Jewish tradition, and particularly the Temple Mount, with the mythological Safon in precisely the same manner as a thousand years earlier the people of Ugarit in their literature identified their sacred mountain, Casios, with Safon, as the people of southeastern Syria and northern Palestine seem also to have identified Hermon with Safon, and in somewhat the same manner as the Babylon ians seem to have envisaged Safon in their seven-staged temple towers. Actually it would appear that this identification of the Temple Mount with Safon would be easier and more ready to hand than the identification of almost any other sacred mountain with Safon. For by a very slight stretch of the imagination Jerusalem may be regarded as a city built upon seven hills or mountains,228 of Hinnom, at the foot of the Temple Mount, to become the place of punishment of the wicked (this idea seems to be basic to Ps. 16.8-11) is the doctrine that an important part of the reward of the righteous will be that thus with their own eyes they will behold the sufferings of the wicked and see therein the proper compensation for their own sufferings at the hands of these their oppres sors in this life (cf. Isa. 66.24; Mal. 3.18-21; Ps. 91.8; perhaps also Ps. 59.11; 92.12; 118.7; 1 Enoch 27.2-3; 48.9; 4 Ezra 7.36-38; Assump. Mos. 10.8-10). Correspondingly, a part of the punishment of the wicked is that they, in turn, while suffering in the abyss below, mu st behold the blessed state of the right eous in Paradise just above them (1 Enoch 27.2-3). A graphic illustration of many of the significant details of this entire con cept may be seen in the so-called Ezekiel panel in the now famous synagogue of Dura (cf. Wischnitzer-Bernstein, "The Conception of the Resurrection in the Ezekiel Panel of the Dura Synagogue," JBL, LX [1941], 43-55, and espe daily pp. 44, 45, 49). There, clearly depicted, we behold what is undoubtedly the Temple Mount, split into two parts. Between the two parts a deep ravine is represented in black color. Upon the summit of each of the two mountains, resulting from the split, a tree, undoubtedly the tree of life, stands straight and unshaken. Above each mountain the Deity is represented symbolically by a pair of divine hands, reaching down from heaven, thus fulfilling the pre diction of Zech. 14.4, that on this great day the Deity would stand with His feet resting on the two mountains. At the foot of the mountain lie the dead of both Judah and Israel, about to be restored to life; for it is the last day, the Day of Yahweh, the Day of Judgment and Resurrection. 228 In this connection the statement in Pirke R. Eliezer 10, that Jerusalem was set upon seven hills, is most illuminating.</page><page sequence="86">86 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [86] viz. the three peaks of the Mount of Olives on the east, Ophel or the original Zion, and the hill west of the Tyropoean Valley on the south,229 Acra to the northwest and the Temple Mount itself in the center, as it were. Moreover, in 1 Enoch 18 and 24, as we have seen, the seven mountains are arranged in the form of a right angle, with Safon, the mountain of the divine throne, at the apex of the angle and therefore at the natural center of the complex. These seven mountains could not be conceived of in this picture as arranged in any other way, since they stood at the northwest corner of the earth. But, as we have learned, in Jewish apocalyptic speculation the Temple Mount, the mountain of the divine throne, was destined to become upon the last day, among other things, the absolute center of the earth.230 Accord ingly the location of the Temple Mount at Jerusalem, almost in the center of the circle or square formed by the six other moun tains, fitted precisely the new role which the mountain of the divine throne was expected to play as the center of the earth, the center of all things, in the new dispensation. Moreover, as we have likewise seen, the location of the Valley of Hinnom in close proximity to the Temple Mount and its ready identification with the abyss lying just beyond Safon facilitated this identi fication of the Temple Mount with Safon and of its entire setting with yarkHe Safon not a little.231 Returning now to Ps. 48 and its interpretation, we are in a position to comprehend the full implication of the statement of v. 3 that Mt. Zion is yarkHe Safon. In his enthusiasm at this, his first, exhilarating sight of the Temple Mount in all its beauty and majesty, the Psalmist spontaneously identifies it with Safon. The passage need not be regarded as specifically apocalyptic. The Psalmist is expressing a present emotion and not a future hope. Yet the age in which he lived and wrote was rife with apocalyptic speculation, and his own thought and vision could not but be affected thereby. Therefore, in his overwhelming joy at beholding the Temple and its Mount and the holy city for the 229 Cf. 1 Enoch 26.1-5 for the three mountains forming the southern side of this square, of which the Temple Mount was the center. 230 Cf. above, note 148. 231 Cf. Burch, Anthropology and the Apocalypse, 123-138.</page><page sequence="87">[87] psalm 48 87 first time and finding them fulfilling all his most vaulting expecta tions, he can exclaim in w. 2bj3-3 : Of majestic elevation is His holy mount, Joy of the entire earth; Mount Zion is y ark" te Safon, Citadel of the mighty King. The "mighty King" is Yahweh, the "great King" of Mai. 1.14b, the "holy Great One, the radiant Lord, the eternal King" of 1 Enoch 25.3. And Mt. Zion, the Temple Mount, the Psalmist can declare with assurance, is indeed of majestic elevation, is truly to be identified with Safon, or even with yarkHe Safon, is the citadel of Yahweh. There, in the Temple, upon the very summit of the Temple Mount, is Yahweh's throne,23" where, upon each recurrent New Year's Day, He is enthroned anew as universal King.233 There the "host of heaven" assembles about Him in divine council,234 and thither the nations are summoned, in the so-called "enthronement psalms," to gather for homage to Yahweh and for judgment by Him and the determination of fates for the new year now beginning.233 All this and perhaps even more is implicit in the Psalmist's declaration that Mt. Zion is yark'teyark'te Safon and the citadel of the mighty King. VII "To the Very Last Generation" One other passage is indicative of the approximate date of this Ps. Vv. 14b-15 read: That you may relate to the very last generation That this very Yahweh is our God; He (it is who) will forever guide us (upon our pilgrimage). 232 The concept that Yahweh's throne is in heaven (Ps. 11.4; 103.19; also Isa. 66.1) no doubt expressed the old North Semitic mythological idea that the throne of El was upon Safon, "the mountain of assembly (of the gods)" in the far north (cf. Isa. 14.13), the mountain whose foundations extend down to the lowest depths (cf. above, note 166), and whose head reaches up into heaven itself. 253 The true implication of the so-called "enthronement psalms;" cf. Gun kel, Einleitung in die Psalmen, 94-177. 234 Cf. "The Mythological Background of Psalm 82," 40 ff. 253 Cf. especially Ps. 29; 76; 96; 98; 99; also Deut. 32.36-42.</page><page sequence="88">JULIAN MORGENSTERN [88] This motif of recording the wondrous deeds and acts of grace of Yahweh, whether manifested in nature or performed particularly in behalf of Israel, so that they may be communicated to future generations, to the end that these generations may learn to know Yahweh and that their faith in Him may become deep and firm, is one of the commonest and most insistent in all post-exilic biblical writings. Naturally it finds most frequent expression in the psalms, since it is, speaking broadly, in one aspect or another, the basic theme of the psalms. But in other sections of the Bible of manifestly post-exilic composition it finds equally insistent and illuminating expression. One of the most interesting forms is the charge that when in the future256 thy son will ask thee, "What are the testimonies and statutes and ordinances which Yahweh, our God, commanded you?", then thou shalt tell thy son, etc.237 The constant theme in this particular setting seems to be Yahweh's miraculous deliverance of Israel from Egyptian bondage, His settlement of them in Palestine and His fulfillment in this manner of His promise to the patriarchs. Unquestionably these passages have a ritualistic implication. The recounting of Yahweh's deliverance of Israel in this manner is a ceremonial act, precisely as is the recital of those psalms which glorify Yahweh and recount His mighty deeds. This was what came to be known in the worship and literature of the post-exilic age as תהלה, "praise." It was an integral and essential part of the formal worship of Yahweh in both the synagogue and the home. It was altogether independent of, and supplementary to, the even more formal sacrificial wor ship of the Temple. The recounting in this manner of the won drous deeds of Yahweh and the praise of His goodness, faith fulness, justice and mercy constituted the "sanctification of His name" and served to establish His reputation as the one, uni versai God both in Israel and also, theoretically at least, among the nations. It was a simple ritual procedure which grew quite naturally out of the doctrine of "for His name's sake." *.מחר 6נ "נ Deut. 6.20-25; Ex. 10.2; 13.8-9, 14-16; all these passages are likewise RD interpolations.</page><page sequence="89">[89] psalm 48 89 In particular the ritual procedure envisioned in Deut. 6.20-25 is undoubtedly connected with the supper in the home upon the eve of the Passover, which has come to be known in Jewish tra dition and practice as the "Seder" or the "Haggadah."238 That it was an established religious institution in the time of Jesus is, of course, amply attested by the Gospels. The legislation for it is recorded in Ex. 12.3-11, a section of P, and therefore of post exilic composition.239 This establishes conclusively that this insti tution was current already fairly early in the post-exilic period. In actual effect this P legislation repeals the D1 legislation re corded in Deut. 16.1-7, which commanded the sacrifice and eating of the Paschal lamb at the single central sanctuary. The P legislation restores the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb with all its attendant rites to its original state as a ceremony of vital importance performed, not at the sanctuary, but at the home, and designed to protect the home from invasion by evil spirits, par ticularly the spirits of the dead.240 That the ritual acts of this sacred meal in the home were supplemented by a spoken cere monial of some kind, is beyond question. Deut. 6.20-25 records one detail of this attendant spoken ceremonial, a rite which has persisted in Jewish practice to the present day. It was a char acteristic ceremony of praise of Yahweh and extolling of His might and of His protection and favor of Israel. Furthermore, it is almost self-apparent that this ceremonial procedure of praise of Yahweh and recounting of His mighty acts and His beneficence to Israel and to all mankind, directed particularly to the end that future generations might find therein «8 Cf. JE, XI, 142 ff. "3י Note that the parallel J legislation in Ex. 12.21-23 provides only for the ritual smearing of the blood of the Paschal lamb upon the doorway, but makes no mention whatever of a ritual meal with the necessary attendant ceremonial. 240 With this interesting and important matter I shall deal, in detail and with full presentation of evidence, in my oft-cited work, Rites of Birth, Marriage, Death Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites, whenever freedom from près sing administrative duties will permit me to finish that study. Meanwhile note that the form of the ceremony recorded in J, certainly a pre-Deuteronomic writing, is celebrated at the home, and not at a sanctuary, either local or at Jerusalem.</page><page sequence="90">90 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [90] strengthening and deepening of faith and so renew their allé giance to Yahweh, not only grew out of the doctrine of "for His name's sake," but also is basically dependent upon Jeremiah's doctrine of the new and eternal covenant of Yahweh with Israel; for only therein is there the basic assurance of a future for Israel and of enduring and unbreakable covenant relations between Yahweh and the generations to come. Also it is clear that in the principle underlying this doctrine and ritual practice, viz. that the most convincing evidence of the truth of Yahweh's existence and universal power and of His favor towards Israel and His covenant with it may be seen in the record of His marvellous deliverance of Israel from Egypt, with all its attendant circum stances, and of His subsequent unfailing care of Israel, in other words in Israel's history, the direct influence of Deutero-Isaiah's fundamental doctrine of "God in history" may be discerned. All this cumulative evidence points unmistakably to the con elusion that all this extensive biblical literature, in which this particular motif finds such vigorous expression, must come from the post-exilic period and cannot, under any circumstance, be older than Deutero-Isaiah. The significance of these consid erations for the proper interpretation of vv. 14b-15 is self evident. These various considerations, the dependence of Ps. 48A upon the doctrines of "for His name's sake" and of Yahweh as the universal King, the identification of Mount Zion with Safon, and the import of vv. 14b—15, establish with absolute certainty that it is a post-exilic composition, later than Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah. Yet, as we have seen, the description of Jerusalem which the Ps. gives, a city with a wall, towers and palaces, and in which the Temple is standing, a city flushed with joy and pride and imbued with a deep faith that it was favored of Yahweh and could therefore look forward confidently to a long and glorious future, forbids our dating the Ps. later than the great national catastrophe of 485 B.C. All this points con clusively to a date somewhere between 516 or, more specifically, 500 and 485 B.C. for the composition of this beautiful and stir ring Ps.</page><page sequence="91">[91] psalm 48 91 VIII The Interpretation of Ps. 48A The interpretation of Ps. 48A now becomes relatively simple. The excision of w. 5-8 removes every suggestion of a specific historic background for the Ps. and so eliminates the chief grounds for the grave confusion and uncertainty which have characterized its interpretation in the past. In the first place it disposes completely of the interpretation of the Ps. in a specific historical setting, whether this be that of the reign of Senacherib or of some particular event of the Maccabaean period. But equally Gunkel's eschatological interpretation of the Ps. loses its very first premise, since, with the excision of vv. 5-8, the hostile kings disappear from the scene completely. For the same reason, although perhaps to a somewhat less degree, does this consideration necessitate the rejection of the hypothesis first proposed by Mowinckel,241 and later expanded by Johnson, that the Ps. constitutes the spoken ritual associated with a festal celebration, which commemorated, in part at least, Yahweh's triumph over His enemies, and which was attended by a ritual procession and also by a mimetic representation of Yahweh's struggle and victory; for with Mowinckel at least Yahweh's enemies are symbolized by the foreign kings of v. 5, who presumably assemble against Him. Moreover, while vv. 13-14a might, in a pinch, particularly if they stood alone or in a more specific setting, be construed as the command to make a journey about Jerusalem, and while doing so to note its mag nificence, actually there is absolutely nothing in these vv. which in any way suggests a formal, and still less a ritual, procession. A ritual procession would have concerned itself much more directly with considerations of the Deity and of His acts than with the physical splendor of the holy city. Johnson would see in the last word of v. 15 a specific mention of Mot, the North Semitic deity of the netherworld, the adversary of 'Al'eyan-Ba'al in Ugaritic mythology, here represented as the constant enemy of Yahweh and His people, over whom, however, after bitter struggle, Yahweh gains a glorious victory. This 241 Cf. above, p. 3.</page><page sequence="92">92 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [92] hypothesis is exceedingly attractive, and all the more so since there are definite indications that Mot and the netherworld did play a not insignificant role in the mythological speculation of certain Jewish circles in Palestine in the early post-exilic period. But this interpretation of מות in v. 15 is altogether conjectural; nor is there any reference whatever elsewhere in the Ps. to justify this interpretation. Various commentators242 would link על־מות with the beginning of Ps. 49, and for this there seems to be reason able justification. However, with this transfer Ps. 48A would end very abruptly, both in metrical form and thought content. For this reason the comparatively minor emendation of על־מות to עולם ועד, as we have suggested,243 seems preferable. But with this Mot disappears completely as the adversary of Yahweh in this Ps. along with the other enemies supposedly referred to in vv. 5-8. Finally, Johnson would render דמינו, of v. 10 "we have plan ned," a meaning which he derives from what he regards as a primary connotation of the verb, דמה, in the pi'el, "to picture." But even if it be granted that this primary meaning can be justi fied, which is by no means certain, none the less it is difficult to conjecture how "to plan" may be derived therefrom; and still more difficult is it to imagine precisely what "we have planned Thy devotion" can mean or how, with the best intentions in the world, this can in any way indicate a ritual or mimetic act. Therefore, despite Johnson's confident claim that with this inter prêta prêta tion of the Ps. "we have conclusive evidence for the exist ence of ritual drama" in ancient Israel, we must reject completely this interpretation of the Ps., both Mowinckel's original inter prêta tion and Johnson's expansion thereof. Ritual or mimetic drama there may have been in ancient Israel; but certainly Ps. 48A is not an instance nor offers the slightest evidence thereof. We are compelled therefore to return to the interpretation of those scholars who regard the Ps. as of pilgrimage character, the chant or utterance of a body of pilgrims coming up to Jerusalem to join in the celebration of one of the three annual pilgrimage 242 Cf. Buhl, in Kittel, Biblia Hebraica,3 and May, "A1 in the Super scriptions of the Psalms," AJSL, LV (1941), 77 f. 243 Above, p. 20.</page><page sequence="93">[93] psalm 48 93 festivals.244 But there is neither need nor justification for looking so far afield as those scholars who, speaking in the broadest terms, hold that these pilgrims come from somewhere in the Diaspora, and still less justification for subscribing to the more specific conclusion of Duhm and Bertholet, based, it must be admitted, upon very precarious grounds, that these pilgrims came from somewhere in Egypt. On the contrary, the identification of Mount Zion with yarkete Safon, with its hint that in the minds of these pilgrims North Semitic mythology held a significant place, suggests that these pilgrims in all likelihood came from the north, most probably from Galilee.245 It is undoubtedly a Galilean pilgrimage psalm, precisely as Ps. 42-43 unmistakably is, and as are not improbably a few other psalms.246 As has been suggested,247 the Ps. seems to voice the joyous reactions of a devout pilgrim or body of pilgrims beholding the holy city for the first time and finding it, at this first glance, equalling or even exceeding rumor and expectation.248 The assumption that the pilgrims in question came from Galilee, and by the customary route leading through Trans-Jordan and approaching Jerusalem over the Mount of Olives, almost enables us to fix the precise geographical setting of the Ps., the vantage point from which these Galilean pilgrims got their first, exhilarat ing view of the city of their hopes and longings. In his account of the Mount of Olives249 Warren writes, "The road on leaving Bethany passes over a spur of Olivet which runs out to the south east; from here a view is obtained of the southern part of the Holy City; then the road descends into a hollow, and mounting again by a rugged ascent it reaches a ledge of smooth rock from which the whole city bursts, into view. This point is opposite to the south-east angle of the temple enclosure and considerably above it. 'Nowhere else on the Mount of Olives is there a view like this. By the two other approaches, one being over the sum mit and one over the northern shoulder of the hill, the city reveals 244 Cf. above, p. 2. us Cf.

"25° Certainly pious pilgrims, coming from Galilee, with an imaginary picture of the holy city, based entirely upon the reports of earlier pilgrims, deeply embedded in their yearning hearts, and now confronted with an actual vision of the holy city, bursting upon them in all its splendor, might well exclaim : Of majestic elevation is His holy mount, Joy of the entire earth; Mount Zion is yarkHe Safon, Citadel of the mighty King. In her palaces God is recognized as a tower of strength; May God establish her forever. Even as we have heard, so do we behold The city of Yahweh, our God. And in their infectious enthusiasm they might well declare to one another: Go round about Zion and make the circuit of her; Enumerate her towers; Take note of her wall; Give heed to her palaces; That you may relate to the very last generation That this very Yahweh is our God; He (it is who) will forever guide us (upon our pilgrimage). With this description of Jerusalem we may well compare another, less direct and spontaneous and more artificial no doubt, yet voicing much the same deeply reverent and exulting spirit:251 The city which God loved He made more radiant than the stars and the sun and the moon ; and He set it as the jewel of the world, and made a temple exceeding fair in its fair sanctuary, and fashioned it in size of many fur longs, with a giant tower touching the very clouds252 and 25° The reference is to Luke 19.37, 41. 2s1 Syb. Orac., V, 420-427 (Lanchester's translation) in Charles, Apocrypha and and Pseudepigrapha of the 0. T., II, 405. 252 Again the motif of the throne of Yahweh, here, of course, located in the Temple, being set above the clouds, i. e. in the heavens; cf. above, note 232.</page><page sequence="95">[95] psalm 48 95 seen of all, so that all the faithful and all the righteous may see the glory of the invisible God, the vision of delight. And not only can we, with reasonable probability, fix the spot upon the Mount of Olives from which this glorious and inspiring vision was beheld by the expectant pilgrims, but also with even greater probability can we fix the occasion. That it was a festival pilgrimage is self-evident; but which festival? Here the reference to the rejoicing of the maidens of Judah in v. 12 furnishes the clue. For on two festivals each year it was customary for the maidens of Jerusalem to go out and dance in the vineyards, while the young men stood about and from the ranks of the dancers selected their future wives.253 The one festi val was that extending from the 9th through the 15th of the fifth month; but this was not one of the three annual pilgrimage festivals and so could not have been the occasion for the pil grimage which this Ps. records. The other festival was the great est festival of the religious year, the Asif-New Year's Day, extending over the last seven days of the year and reaching its culmination in the celebration of the New Year's Day upon the first day of the new year, upon the 10th of the seventh month.254 It was upon this day, the great day of the festival, that the dances of the maidens in the vineyards occurred. This entire festival, covering eight days, was generally referred to as החג, "the Festival," the pilgrimage festival par excellence. This must have been the festival which occasioned the pilgrimage of the Galilean pilgrims, whose piously joyous emotions Ps. 48A re cords so stirringly. And with this we may leave this beautiful Ps., believing not only that we have interpreted it faithfully in the light of the religious beliefs and practices of its day, the period about 500 B.C., but also that in so doing we have illumined somewhat some of the most interesting and significant of these beliefs and practices. 25ג Cf. "Two Ancient Israelite Agricultural Festivals," JQR (new series), VIII (1917), 31-54. Cf. "The Three Calendars of Ancient Israel," HUCA, I (1924), 22-64.</page></plain_text>
