Symeon, The New Theologian I. TYPES OF RATIONALITY AND THE PROBLEM OF DIFFERENT ENDS IN HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT There seems to be no end to the polemics started by Max Weber's famous essay on the role of Protestant ethics in the formation of modern capitalist society.1 Weber suggested that in the original features of a certain kind of religiosity, as in the bud, one can recognize a specific social action which later unfolds into a definite 'ideal type' of society. For some this suggestion sounded unsuitable because, if Weber is right, the elements of the socio-historical process were changed by the force of religious ideas, mysteriously conditioning a quite irreligious economic behaviour, rather than by the material relations in the productive process. Others accused Weber of a very questionable and wanton attempt to reduce the whole mass of extremely diverse and differentiated activity in modern society to a single and exclusive type. Not because they failed to understand the importance of a prototype: everybody knows that even such a complex and differentiated organization as man develops from one cell, containing his 'genetic code', provided the material mechanisms required for this development remain unimpaired. But it sounded unbelie vable that any kind of prototype could survive and influence the subse quent social formation in its totality, because the religious stimuli in modern life are strongly deteriorated. The t hird, and most numerous group of Weber's opponents, was dis satisfied with the weak demonstrability of Weber'stheoryinitsvery essence.lt can be assumed that the Protestant type of ethics overpowered all other forms of religiosity and, by dominating social life, exerted its crucial influence on the non-religious economic behaviour, only if there is some evidence that, under the domination of all other forms of religiosity except</page><page sequence="3">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 343 Protestantism, the sphere of economic relations either remains uninfluenced by ethical factors, or that these factors impede development of the capitalist economy, or that they promote something quite different, or, finally, that capitalism develops in devious ways and very slowly, under the 'recessive' influence of some Protestant-like ethics. To extricate himself from all these alternatives, Weber appealed to comparative analysis and traced the patterns of relations between religious attitude and economic behaviour in different societies. But there the main methodological difficulty lay in wait. Admitting the exclusive ability of Protestantism to influence human activity outside the proper sphere of religion, and primarily to drive it towards intensive economic production, also considering Protestantism transformable into its opposite (i.e., from the religious, though completely interiorized and symbolically reduced self-consciousness, into the secular voluntarism underlying individual economic inteests), Weber had to assume that all other religious movements, comparable with Protestantism or different from it, are devoid of these two features. In other words, to follow his logic, even the slightest manifestations ofthat kind of interest should be immediately ascribed to the Protestant or similar influences. Thus Weber and all the sociological tradition in his wake were trapped in a vicious circle. They searched other civilizations for religious movements resembling Protestantism, or contrasting with it, or simply tending toward the realization of its ideal. And, of course, it was assumed that all such options would automatically determine economic growth in the capitalist direction. Unfortunately, this presumption cannot be verified. At present, all societies have experienced a more or less strong impact of modern capitalism (under different names of'modernization', 'Westernization', 'development', etc.); so that it is impossible to know whether their inde pendent development would ever have brought other results, also on account of the penetration of religious consciousness into the sphere of the secular. It now looks probable, for example, that in mediaeval Japan many features of social life and popular consciousness foreshadowed the precipi tous development ofthat country in the capitalist direction at the close of the 19th century. But who can assert that, if there had been no Western influence at all, all these features and trends would ever have brought capitalism to Japan by themselves? On the other hand, if we reduce the</page><page sequence="4">344 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN conceptual vectors of capitalism in other countries merely to Western influence, Weber's argumentation would be impaired in its essence, because, according to him, only inner stimulation by cultural values can trigger the forces of economic and industrial growth. Then what remains of Weber's method of 'ideal types' other than a brilliant sketch of American society in the period of advanced capitalism? The author of this study was himself convinced of the authenticity of Weber's description when, for the first time, he saw the America of the 1970's, a society which, to his fresh eyes, looked very traditional, with the invisibly preserved principles of the Protestant style of life, despite all later additions of modern scientific-technological civilization, despite the influx of emigrants from various cultures (who willingly reproduce and even reinforce in their life styles the inner and historically alien patterns of Protestantism), and even regardless of the vestigial nature of Protestant ethics itself as a religiously organized form of social behaviour. Be this impression ever so subjective, it is still not clear why everything had to happen exactly in that way and what forces could be responsible for the preservation of this strange tradition of self-sublation. The problem can be made much easier if we succeed in discovering another independent case of departure from religiously oriented life, where its substance is nevertheless preserved in extra-religious social activity. This should mean transition to something different than religion, and in a quite independent way, i.e., without influence of the available capitalist pattern ('Protestant' in its roots, if Weber is right); perhaps, even in spite of this pattern (if the impact of capitalism were experienced, then rejected, and the society went its own way). Only in such a perspective would we be able to assess both the scientific validity of Weber's method and the nature of the mechanisms at work in the different types of cultural tradition. What follows is an attempt to prove that such is the case in the correspondence between the material essence of Soviet Communism (i.e., not the theoretical, abstract Marxist conception, but the immediate reality of Soviet society which, according to the author's judgment, has successful ly developed its Communist potencies) and the Byzantine-Russian tradi tion of Orthodox Christian ethics. This case is particularly remarkable, because it allows us to go through the whole range of sociological problems and to penetrate into their anthropological structure.</page><page sequence="5">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 345 II. THE OLD BELIEVERS' 'RATIONALISM' AGAINST THE ANTI-STRUCTURE' OF FUNDAMENTAL ORTHODOXY To begin with, it seems important to decide whether the influence of Protestantism, in the sense of its transcending the bounds of the purely religious life, was not merely due to the fact that, by reducing the expenditure of time and effort for the external manifestations of religiosity (ritual, material and social regulations, sacerdotal hierarchy, relations of property and politics as in Catholicism), and also by making religious symbolism nominal and contingent (thus securing the individual's indepen dence of the Church organization and style of life), Protestantism was in the negative sense convenient for accumulation of the time reserve needed for capitalist business. Or were there also some positive stimuli and motivations for that kind of activity, thereby explaining the mysterious transition from the 'reduced' Protestant religiosity to its secular counter part? In other words, are we in the right to insist on material continuity or do we simply have to admit the decrease of one form of social life and expansion of the other in its stead, as a more successful competitor occupies the 'social space' evacuated by the loser? We hope to convince the reader to accept the lesson of Orthodox ethics, where the time required for religious duties was not reduced. Sometimes such duties could occupy the whole span of human life. But not of most members of society: rather of those 'chosen few' called 'spiritual athletes' in the Byzantine idiom who wrought out deification ('theosis') and were occupied literally with the 'production of the holy', while mass religiosity could slip down beyond any control and sometimes reach the lowest limit (lower than in formalized' Protestantism) even zero (to wit, in the words of Alexander Blok, "to sin shamelessly, inveterately..."). And, of course, this polarization produced lasting effects by creating the time reserve for extra-religious activity. What stands as crucial here is, of course, the problem of ?it positively stimulated activity in a certain extra-religious, perhaps even anti-religious, direction. Both cases would meet the time requirement: Orthodoxy probably even more absolutely than Protestantism, considering the masses of population without the celebrated 'Sunday mood', not 'reposing for the holy' as is actually practiced in the Soviet Union during the campaigns of 'uninterrupted weeks' {'nepreryvka', 'subbotniks and 'voskresniks') be cause, in the context of our present interest, all such forms of voluntary</page><page sequence="6">346 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN unpaid work on days off can be considered hypertrophies of the Protestant motto, 'Labour is your prayer'. The radical question, however, is what the people, liberated from religion, would make themselves busy with? It seems natural to presuppose an immanent religious interest, even in the minimal ized time expenditures implied by the Protestant formula which equates labour with prayer but not vice versa. Even if the problem can be reduced to a stratification of natural human interest at the anthropological level into the absolutely busy 'religious virtuosi' and the absolutely loose, religiously uncommitted and boredom-plagued majority, still we have to find some weighty evidence that 'positive stimulation' can issue in different solutions of the radical problem of the purpose of human existence. We must, first of all, separate the symbolic and the actionist presentations of this problem which means, of course, a modification of the famous Weberian predica ment of'cultural meaning'. The attempts to apply Weber's schema to capitalist developments in Russia are scanty and unconvincing. Perhaps most sociologists, econo mists and social historians realize that the method and the material are incongenial. One of the few interesting and insightful approaches is found in Alexander Gerschenkron's book, Russia: Mirror of Europe.2 The author locates Russia at one extreme of the spectrum of types of capitalist development under the influence of transformed religious consciousness, while the opposite extreme, of course, is alloted to America. Presenting the Russian situation as an extremely degenerate case, he actually succeeded in finding traces of the capitalist spirit in economics among the Old Believers. And, indeed, the practical ethics of Old Belief had a lot of features in common with Puritanism. The emphasis on the 'fear of God' which always hung over human conscience, was able to generate a feeling of sinfulness and guilt, like in Protestantism. But the important notion of the 'autonomy of will' which, in particular, could be directed toward positive achieve ments in this world, was significantly missing. As in the case of retained priestly rite, so in the extreme case of 'bespopovscina' (absence of priests), the religious life of the Russian Old Believers resembled the Presbyterian organization of Protestantism. Absence of a Church hierarchy, moral strictness of family life, and mainly diasporic existence resulted in the subsequent reduction of religious participation down to the level of separate communities. All this entailed the development of a series of 'Protestant' features in Old Belief, thus essentially confirming the Weberi</page><page sequence="7">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 347 an schema. The role and importance of the merchant and of the industrial capital of the Old Believers in the primitive economic development of Russia - especially in the 17th and 18th centuries - cannot be denied. Their credo, 'Make money and pray to God', sounds very familiar and it should have been no less conducive to 'primitive accumulation' than the Protes tant ethic. But, this accumulation was later wasted or idly treasured, since the State economic policy dominated and foreign entrepreneurship and investments were favored. It is most important to stress the irreconcilable conflict between the 'natural' economic growth of capitalism and the artificial and forceful measures of'Westernization' undertaken by the authoritarian government. No wonder Gerschenkron detected so many resemblances between the means and methods of transformation of Russia by Peter the Great (a most virulent persecutor of Old Believers) and those employed during the socialist industrialization of the U.S.S.R. (though his label of'mercantilism' for the State economic policy does not seem very appropriate. In this regard, we can say, the similarity between the American Protes tants and the Russian Old Believers is determined by the basic fact that both were a persecuted party, 'protesting' against the dominant ecclesiasti cal and political establishment. Both were a great dealforced by the 'attendant circumstances' to organize their communal life and personal relations on the principles of rationality. They had to think more soberly about the urgent problems of survival in the hostile world by opening up new territories and kinds of activity remote from the persecuting civiliza tion. The spirit of adaptivity and escapism in early American Protestan tism, especially in its popular forms, is often underestimated. Perhaps this spirit is more preserved in modern consumerism than in an active psycholo gy of initiative and adventure. Because of the scientific revolution and the enormous proliferation of a bureaucratic federal administration, political factors now dominate economic ones. Protestant ethics, instead of being creative, turns adaptive or simply hostile to the 'ghost of establishment', remaining true to its traditional roots. The impeding influence of the 'Protestant complex' can be described as one of the major contradictions of modern American society and a permanent source of social and political tensions, both domestic and foreign. The particularistic ethics of Protes tantism turns out to be incompatible with the United States' role as great power, with the resultant imperial ideology. When the United States, as a</page><page sequence="8">348 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN result of their extraordinary economic and technological advancement, started playing that role in international affairs, it entailed a series of severe moral, political and organizational crises, both domestic and foreign, and the subsequent reinforcement of isolationist tendencies issuing in a quite ambiguous situation, where the economically and technologically leading country of the world is tending to be politically self-restrictive, even provincial. If retention of the traditional structures and styles of life in any society predetermines the highest possible level of its economic development, the same must be true about the growth of its political body. Of course, it is too early to assert that the American political establishment has passed its climactic point, unless this suggestion is supported by strong empirical evidence. What seems obvious, however, is that the democratic system of government, once created on the basis of the adaptive particularistic ethics of Protestantism, is losing its effectiveness and in many cases is tempted to retreat before the expanding political totalitarianism, as if this latter were more able to cope with the urgent global problems. This, of course, is how the question stands in its social aspects. No less serious and perhaps more fundamental is the fact that the Protestant type of ethics also appears as controversial and over-adaptive in the anthropo logical sense, especially when related to the liminal problems of human existence and the cardinal metaphysical question of real personal autono my and freedom. In this case, the factor of political power appears at the foreground and outweighs the economic motivations. Perhaps the lesson of Russian Old Belief is particularly instructive as a pure version of conflict between two different trends in secular rationalization, the political and the economic. When the initiative of economical development in Russia was taken over by the State, the Old Believers' vigor in the pursuit of 'primitive accumulation' slackened, and a deep inner discord in their souls was revealed. It was no accident that the 'Protestant' roots of the rich Old Believers generously supplied with living resources the rising Anarchism and Bolshevik organization, to mention just two among the many anti government movements in Russia (the history of Savva Morozov and others of his kind speaks for itself). The sentiments of discord and resentment were so deeply interiorized that their action on human souls lasted even when the external pressure of the State was considerably relieved. It happened that certain steps toward liberalization and religious</page><page sequence="9">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 349 freedom in Russia in the first decade of the 20th century paradoxically provoked more frequent cases of self-immolation and extremist sectarian ism among Old Believers, who worshipped the 'ferocious', the 'burning' Christ, instead of the Orthodox 'sweetest One'. The role of this popular discontent and deeply ensconced resentment in the Communist upheaval was never properly appreciated, though their triggering function in over throwing Tsarist autocracy is well known. It remains questionable whether Rasputin was an Old Believer, but the familiar spirit of resentment is the same as described by Nikolay Gumilev in his poem, 'The Peasant': "In the thickets, in the vast swamps, by the river oftin, in shaggy dark huts, there live strange peasants. One of them goes out into the trackless wastes where the feather-grass has run riot, and, sensing an ancient legend, listens to the cries of Stribog... Here he is now with a scrip, filling the forest path with a song. slow and soft, but mischievous, so mischievous. His path is light and darkness, the whistle of robbers in the fields quarrels, bloody brawls in taverns horrible as nightmares: He enters our proud capital - God save us! - and bewitches the Empress of boundless Russia by his gaze, his child-like smile, his speech that is so mischievous - and on his mighty chest there glitters a golden cross. Alas, why did not the cross on the Kazan' Cathedral and the one on St. Isaak bend and leave their place? Shots, shouting and the tocsin are heard over the stunned capital; the city has bared its teeth like a lioness protecting her young. "Well, Orthodox folk, burn my corpse on a dark bridge, throw the ashes to the wind ... Who will protect the orphan?</page><page sequence="10">350 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN .. In the wild and poor country there are many such peasants; the joyful tramp of their footsteps is heard along your roads".3 The problem of Old Belief is discussed here at length mainly because some still describe it as a 'rational' tendency of Russian history, and even prescribe, as Alexander Solzhenitsyn recently did, a return to the 'old virtues' in order to 'save' Russia from the 'Communist obsession'. There seems to be little doubt that their ethics and economic behaviour were rational once, but, in the centuries-long struggle of the two basic social institutions of economy and power, their'rationality'destroyed itself and in many ways contributed to the advent of Communism, i.e., to the eventual victory of the institution of political power. The inner decomposi tion and conflict-raising function of'native'(i.e., not'Westernized') Russian economic rationality speak in favour of our hypothesis. Both of them heavily contributed to that peculiar 'anti-structure' (in the anthropo logical meaning explained below) which became completely manifest after the takeover by the Communists of political power from their old enemies, Tsardom and official Orthodoxy. The corrupted economic interests with their anti-structural relations with religious sentiments, funded their triumph and significantly helped the eventful victory of Power over Economy in the Communist Revolution. A prophetic description ofthat kind of interest, in its utmost form of'minus-morality' blending together the fate of Old Believers and other 'primitive accumulators' is found in Alexander Blok's nameless poem: To sin shamelessly, inveterately, to lose count of nights and days And, with the head tight with drunkenness, To sneak stealthily into God's temple. To bend down thrice, To cross oneself seven times. To touch, on the quiet, the bespattered floor With the hot forehead. While putting a brass farthing into the plate, To kiss thrice, and then seven times on end, The ages-old, poor icon-framework, All besmirched with kisses.</page><page sequence="11">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 351 And in a while, returning home, to give short measure By the same farthing, And, with the replete hiccups, To kick the starving dog aside from the door. And, sitting under the icon-lamp, To drink tea and click abacus, Then to open the paunchy chest of drawers And slobber over the coupons. And finally to fall into the feather-bed, In a heavy slumber... Yes, even such, oh my Russia, Of all countries you are the dearest to me.5 Leaving aside many other aspects of this description, we may assert that the main feature of Protestantism, that is, equating labour with prayer, was utterly missing in Old Belief. In other words, though ascetic sentiments were quite typical at one time, in no case was it the Protestant, 'this worldly' asceticism. The rationalistic attitude in economic matters was present, but mainly as a function of adaptation to the hard conditions of life (as is partly true, of course, about American Protestantism as well; to wit, 'Necessity is the mother of invention' ). Besides, Old Belief, though being 'heteropractical', never developed into a full-fledged 'heterodoxy', with the corresponding symbolic transforma tion of the Orthodox anthropological essentialism into a Protestant nominalism, thus releasing the forces of people for purposeful secular action in the pursuit of their economic interests. This means that it is only to fundamental Orthodoxy, if anywhere at all, that we should look for the roots ofthat peculiar attitude toward power (as well as for the motives of its prevalence) which though with some antecedents in the so-called 'Russian Idea' turned out to be consonant with the Communist doctrine of Karl Marx and resulted in the creation of Soviet society. In tracing out these potential roots, our main point is to demonstrate how religious absolutism was eventually secularized apolitical absolutism. III. MARXISM AND THE'ASIATIC MODE OF THIN KING' Perhaps there have been too many allusions to the mirror-like semblance between Marxism and Christianity which, being also a kind of opposition,</page><page sequence="12">352 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN never implies a substantial, material community. A lot of parallels can be found between Communism and the ethics of the Gospel as well as the 'communal' spirit of early Christianity (both in the sense of equality in property and fraternity in Christ). There should be added the principle of historicism, discovered in the Old Testament and richly mixed with millenarian ideals. Formal translation in this case is not very difficult: from Sermon on the Mount to promises of the Kingdom of justice on earth; from blessings to the 'meek in Spirit' and warnings to the rich, to the famous words of'The International': We shall destroy this world of untruth Down to the ground, and then We shall build our brave new world: Who was nothing, he shall be everything. Both Communism and Christianity are supra-national, universalistic, all-embracing. Both are oriented from the 'present day' to the 'future to come'. Both promise punishment for sins and vengeance for injustice. Both follow the principle of'practical elitism' and accentuate the role of consolidating organization. The Communist Party hierarchy is often compared with the Church hierarchy, and its politics, tactics, and ethics of the 'end vindicates the means', as well as its principle of'salvation of sinners even against their will' are often associated rightly or wrongly with the Jesuit Order. But, of course, all these and many similar comparisons are superficial. They hardly can matter even in the bare sociological sense of'common functions'. First of all, where would you get Christ, i.e., a personal promise to every believer? Also the anthropological schema of Christianity, with its symbolism of life, passion, death, and resurrection of Christ, cannot be reproduced in the Communist promise. True, the principle of belief in the promised future is inherent in both, but what are the real features ofthat future? The Kingdom of God on earth, though without the King? Just the Almighty as an abstract idea? But that can provide the basis of belief only from the vantage point of pure logical Reason, neglecting the complexity of Man. What do the Communists propound as their 'creed'? Something about the scientific, technological, and economic development of society, which will provide an abundance of material and spiritual wealth for all. As a</page><page sequence="13">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 353 result, everybody will consume whatever he may need, at the same time producing, i.e., giving the society his labour, according to his capacity to work. This program implies the miraculous transformation of conscious ness of each and everybody, so that the above-described conditions can be perpetuated. In other words, human nature will be rationalized to the extent that all 'dysfunctional' instincts and desires would never be able to disbalance its performance, nor even to occur to one's mind. In particular, people will drop irrational fears (of death, for example) and cease to desire impossible things (such as personal immortality). They will be contented by the mere knowledge that, after their departure, 'everything stays behind for the people'. To render the same in Marxist terminology, the problems of 'natural alienation' of the human personality will be sublated by the free efforts of everybody who recognizes their natural necessity. The Christian promise is succinctly defined in the Confession of Faith. According to it, the true believers should expect personal resurrection and reunion of their mortal bodies with their immortal souls. This and similar promises can be described as surpassing 'natural alienation'. It looks like Communism is possible, but still not actual, since the abundance of wealth is provided while 'natural alienation' also remains. In other words, Communism will come sooner for the ascetic, strong enough to cut down his basic material needs and to subdue the Natural Man in himself, i.e., for the one who is able to 'rationalize' his spiritual efforts, directed from within. Christianity does not deny the possibility of that kind of spiritual heroism for the chosen few, but it never requires that the majority should follow the same way. Communism, on the contrary, promises abundance for all in some indefinite future, but actually imposes the policy of scarcity on the majority in the present. This basic contradiction seems impossible to overcome. But we shall try to demonstrate that exactly this kind of possibility was offered or, if you will, 'codified' in the spirit of Eastern, i.e., Byzantine-Russian, Orthodox Christianity. True, it was offered to a chosen few, but it was through the realization and awareness of that offer by the masses of people that the final victory of Soviet Communism became possible, and that Soviet society grew as a viable and self perpetuating social system. To ground this thesis, we have to start our movement in the pre Ref ormation epoch, at the crossroad where the paths of Western and Eastern Christianity parted forever. The Western Catholic Church and its</page><page sequence="14">354 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN theologians soon had to face the Reformation, while its possibility in the East was cut short beforehand. This means that their separation was not mere severance. Eastern Orthodoxy acquired some new qualities which enabled it first to emancipate the principle of political power from the purely religious content, and then to turn the content ofthat principle against its original symbolic forms, both anthropomorphic and theomor phic, i.e., against autocracy embodied in single individuals and against personal divinity. This final outcome was wrought out after a long struggle, but did not essentially contradict the spirit of fundamental Orthodoxy but rather was suggested by that spirit. The force of religious ideas continued its action and development beyond the limits of religious consciousness. Just as in the West, in respect of Protestantism and capitalism, so it was in Russia, though in a quite different dimension, between Orthodoxy and Communism. Departure from the West means moving Eastward not only in the geographical sense. Many Oriental or so-called 'Asiatic'forms of social organization and their corresponding symbolic forms were restored during the Low Empire; or, rather, they developed anew, following some original ancient prototypes. In particular, the idea of the Almighty, of Cosmocracy is typically 'Asiatic': its development, say, in Buddhism is by far more systematic and impressive than in Christianity. Its origins are found in the cult of a 'sacred king', widespread in the oldest civilizations. This cult symbolically reflected the combined effects of material progress (the invention of agriculture), of the communal way of life, and of the origina tion of the State in its earliest forms. The relevant anthropological evidence is too rich and well-known to be mentioned here in detail. What is important for our purposes is that the same kind of symbolism was associated not only with a definite stage in the social order but also with a peculiar condition (or 'modus' of human consciousness which, in the language of modern philosophy, is called 'self-consciousness' (or 'reflec tion'). As as matter of fact, the notion of what is now universally known as 'man', i.e., the self-conscious and self-activated subject, desirous of free dom, was originally perceived only as embodied in the king, whose functions of'cultural hero' and symbol of society as a total essence were inherent in him and manifested as his individual self-consciousness. That notion was just the contrary in its content of the witless proclamation of Louis XV: 7am the State'. In fact, it was more like, 'The State cognizes</page><page sequence="15">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 355 itself in me, and it can do it effectively only if I am free'. Thus in ancient Indian philosophy, the Self (atmari), or Transcendental Self Consciousness, originally had the meaning of the king's body. And quite symptomatically, when the early 19th century German Romantics tried to fill in the real historical content of concrete individuality (which the rationalistic treatment of personality in the philosophy of the previous century had turned into a mere abstraction of human freedom, devoid of living self-consciousness), they came across a very similar notion,ranging in its formulations from Hegel's opinion that in the Oriental despotic states only one was free (not as a physical man but namely as something concrete, in which the emerging spirit of the State and political power materializes and cognizes itself), to the young Marx' speculations about the future restoration of concrete human individuality in Communist society. The same idea was contextual for Pushkin's poetry: You are the king; so go alone, Along the road of freedom... It is no wonder that the symbol of'sacred king' was incorporated into all 'world religions' as embodiment of the transcendental promise of freedom. But, being incorporated as a partial component of the original essential totality, its symbolic structure acquired the inverted function of 'attribute'. The 'natural humanity' of the king, the matter of his embodi ment was reduced to the accidental, unimportant, nominalistically symbol ic, and therefore was presentable as mere 'index' of the Promise (compare in Judaism, where the lack of positive insistence on the 'king in the flesh' made it possible recently to materialize the promise in the secular State of Israel). But the potency of its essential restoration always remained a strong integrative factor, especially in the typical historical situations of'split and disintegration' - as happened in Buddhism, in primitive Christianity, and later in Eastern Christianity. All these religious movements insisted on the substantial and active embodiment of the king. In other words, the idea of power and dominance of one individual over the other in the non-formal sense, inherent in the notion of'royalty' or 'lordship', was essentially incorporated into the desire for freedom and reflected in the Christian Confession of Faith (in this respect quite comparable with the passages on 'Lordship and Bondage' in Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind).</page><page sequence="16">356 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN This idea of power, though hierarchical in its structure and perhaps enrooted in the primitive patterns of dominance found in animal societies, must be distinguished in its specific matter from the 'epistemic' scheme of relations, for example, as it constitutes the classical Indian tradition of knowledge maintained between the teacher and the pupil: exactly because, in the second case, it is knowledge, rather than power, which matters in the transaction. This typological distinction is important both historically and analytically. It can help us to understand the nature ofthat specific awareness of political power, which in Byzantium, and afortiori in Moscovia, was inseparable from the religious commitments, but still could work as an independent structuring factor. It is also very relevant as an explanation of the inner int?gr?t ive dynamics of modern Soviet society, because it reveals the predominant public sentiments and expectations at the level of interpersonal relations within the system and in the internation al perspective. If these sentiments and expectations could be once verbal ized with the full historical consideration of the idea of power, they would probably sound as follows. Byunderminingtheideaofhierarchy(literally,'sacred power') as a real implement of the human condition and especially by doing so at two different levels of existence (the mental and the social), and by opposing nominalism to realism and democracy to autocracy as the only rational principles of thinking and of human existence, Western religious thought not only destroyed itself but also paved the way to more radical secular formulations of the premises and in this sense 'preordained' the kingdom of unfreedom for modern Western man. Not only his better aspirations were ruined, but he also became implicitly responsible for the tragedy of non Western civilizations, lured by the falsified ideas and forcefully dragged into a disastrous historical process. The roots of this modern 'world evil' can be detected in the disputes between the mediaeval Nominalists and Realists, in the heretical doctrines of Wycliff and Ockham, in the subse quent Reformation and Protestantism, responsible for the utter falsifica tion of the cardinal problem of human freedom. This evil was nurtured by the symbolic imposition of neo-paganism in the Renaissance attempts to imitate the unhappy civilization of the ancients (in which, as St. Gregory Palamas put it, 'Wisdom turned mad'), with the accompanying infatua tions with Humanism and Enlightenment and the modern uncritical belief in the miracle of an unconstrainedly growing science.</page><page sequence="17">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 357 Marxism was born as an antithesis, a convulsion of Western civilization. Naturally it attained its full materialization in Russia, chosen because of her 'metaphysical' marginality to be a potential 'grave-digger' for the West and avenger for the wrongs it did to the East. Russia herself experienced the strongest Western influence, but she succeeded in preserving the roots of Asiatic 'authenticity'. Owing to its geographical and historical marginality, Russian culture was exposed to many conflicting influences. As a result, the state of'eternal conflict' became its essence. Tortured by the enormous contrasts, Russia became a martyr country, a place where human dignity was humiliated more often and deeply than anywhere else, a battlefield of good and evil. The spirit of'militant action' reposed on Russia, because of its original marginality, and stayed there inverted both inside and outside. And this subject, of course, was the best possible approximation to the basic statements of Marxist social theory. To paraphrase Voltaire, if Marxism had never existed, it would have had to be invented to bring Russia's natural potential to its historical actualization. When Marxism was grafted to the stalk of Russian social life, its reticence and Western-born conventionality were stripped away. It was brought to perfection in its own sense: along the extremely sharp line of acceptance or rejection. Compared to Soviet Marxism, any other kind of Communism must look either like an abstraction or like a superficially imposed complement to the bulk of social existence. This is because in the West the spirit of tragedy is dead and replaced by artifices, while in the East there is nobody with the historically inspiring idea of'Messianic mission'. Only in Russia, where the Universal Spirit has materialized itself in the Com munist State, is the idea of'national Messianism' alive, regardless how vile and/ or kingly its present materialization is. Its body is ugly, but it is a real body able to act, not an apparition. What we have tried to present is a 'model of ideology', an imagined combination of a few ideological components, actually discernible in Soviet society today. As any 'popular mythology', it looks odd and unrealistic in periods of'normal' social development: just like the product of poetical imagination or an idle intellectual game (like Soloviev's 'Pan Mongolism' or Blok's 'The Scythians'). But such mythology can be unpredictably turned into a powerful means of popular action in critical situations, when the social process becomes uneven and spasmodic. So it seems advisable to analyze the historical roots of this ready-to-appear ideology.</page><page sequence="18">358 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN The main obstacle for its integration is, of course, the 'problem of the King'. His self-consciousness is not destroyed, but is separated from his body. According to the Communist idea, the State is indispensable as a mechanism of oppression of the hostile classes and anti-social instincts in individuals, at least until the classless society is created and human nature transformed. Both of these tasks, however, are not carried out spontane ously. Their attainment is the first and foremost assignment of the State itself. When the tasks are accomplished, the State will die away. But in the case of failure in both respects, insofar as the 'antagonistic' classes still grow up and human nature remains 'vile' and 'egoistic', no malfunctioning of the State can lead to its self-liquidation. Quite the contrary: the worse it works, the more indispensable it becomes. If the body survives equally in the case of its good or bad performance, this means that mere expediency is not the law maintaining this peculiar body. In other words, not only its ends justify its means, but also the means justify the ends. This paradoxical feature of 'advanced socialist society' was quite unequivocally explicated by Stalin in the Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. According to his doctrine, the advent of Communism can be hastened by deliberate rein forcement of the class struggle and by more virulent violation of human privacy. This doctrine, well-grounded in the organization of the Soviet State, as well as in its domestic and foreign policy, brought on a few quite strange consequences. To follow its logic, more consolidation of the absolute power of the totalitarian State must signify to its subjects that Communism is close, while any relaxation, liberalization, etc., would mean lingering and a pretty long way still to go. Therefore, the State should be expected soon to reinforce its power, to make Communism closer. In other words, when oppressions go down, it can mean only that they will endure, while their intensification leaves people with a vague hope that soon everything will be over. This, of course, is a typical case of non-distinction of means and ends. But exactly the same is typical for the Orthodox Christian idea concerning the role of power in relations of the State to the individual, of the individual to himself, and even of the State to itself as a concrete individual totality. We can read in the writings of the Fathers of the Church that the same kind of logic works when the individual fights the forces of evil: the closer his victory, the more probably is his deflection and defeat. Only Divine Grace</page><page sequence="19">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 359 can miraculously save him. We shall discuss this issue later, after analyzing how it happened in Eastern Christianity that the secular State extended its functions to provide this saving Grace. This is the main point of relations between the State and the individual. The 'pantocratic' feeling is a feature of the Soviet way of life revealing continuity of the religious tradition and cultural indebtedness to the past. Sometimes Orthodoxy is labeled as 'Caesaropapism'. The Emperor was respected higher than the Patriarch, because he was the Anointed One, the deputy of God on earth. The idea of Imperial Supremacy worked effective ly as a political factor even in Western Europe during the Napoleonic wars. When Bonaparte abolished the Holy Roman Empire, he forced the Pope to bless him as Emperor. In that supreme position of power he hoped to found a new dynasty and thus to perpetuate his political success. It seems almost certain that Byzantium's additional millennium, after the fall of the Western Empire, was mainly owing to the same factor. The Low Empire was destroyed by the infidels, not by the Western Christians who invaded it. The latter conquered it but still did not dare abolish it: they remained under the spell of the archetype. In this connection, it is difficult to over estimate the importance of the political success of Ivan the Third, the Great Prince of Moscovia, who persuaded the Pope to bless his marriage with the last heiress of the Paleologs and thus confirmed the symbolic continuity of the 'cosmocratic' idea, reposing thence in the Moscow primacy. As a result, the Great Princes of Moscovia turned out to be the only sovereigns of Europe who could claim 'natural' descent from Julius Caesar (the Emper ors of the Holy Roman Empire were actually German kings and never claimed that). It is not difficult therefore to understand the envy and rage of the Polish kings, which was the real source of numerous Russian-Polish conflicts in the 16th and 17th centuries. The claim of 'cosmocracy' was the real political argument at that time, as was well corroborated by ferocious attacks from the Polish side and by the remarkable historical fiat of Ivan the Terrible, who, when defeated by the Polish king, found it possible and workable to send an emissary to the Pope, protesting against the Catholic king's 'unfair' military actions as undermining his, Ivan's, sacred mission of 'pantocracy' and imperial expansion. Amazing to say, the complaint worked... Here the reader's attention must be turned to the popular idea of'power' ('pantocracy'), as it was understood at that time, because this idea played its</page><page sequence="20">360 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN crucial role in the famous 'collecting' of the lands around Moscow. In truth, the idea itself was rather the end in itself than the means (or probably both in fusion). The sovereign had to expand his power continuously, he had to conquer and be victorious, in order to stay in line with the ancient Caesars, blessed and approved by Christ Himself- not because of convenience or political opportunism. Almost like the 'celestial mandate' given to the Chinese Emperors, with its potency lasting as long as an Emperor was good enough for his symbolic functions, the Imperial power in Russia was strong and popular to the extent of its success in expansion, in appropriation of whatever lies in temptation's way, and in an almost irrational stubbornness 'not to yield an inch'. It was proven by history that this idea permeated the popular conscious ness so deeply that the principle of'pantocracy' became separable from a concrete individual or dynasty. In 1830, during the Polish revolt and 'cholera riots' in the military settlements around St. Petersburg, the outraged soldiers were killing the Poles who, rumor has it, 'poisoned the wells and caused the disease', together with their officers who tried to protect innocent people. When the Emperor himself appeared and started shouting and stamping his feet at the soldiers, they took him... for an impostor. They simply could not believe that the 'pantocracy' is not at one with them. The first serious defeat of the Tsarist autocracy in the Crimean war of 1854 forced it to retreat into domestic affairs (to abolish serfdom, for example). The 'Imperial Idea' was put aside for a while, and the perspective of capitalist development appeared for the first time. But the people could not forget and forgive. As a result, in a few decades there followed the revenge of the popular Revolution, and the Soviet State was created, in which the 'pantocratic' principle, multiplied by the appeals of the Com munist Manifesto, was restored in its full strength. None other than Stalin indicated the crucial role of Tsardom's additional defeat in the Russian-Japanese war of 1904-1905 for the imminent advent of the Revo lution. It is very important to point out that this 'pantocratism' of the Russian people never had anything to do with psychological aggressiveness or other features of the 'authoritarian personality' complex. First of all, the 'idea' itself was not 'Russian' in the ethnic sense. It was the supra-national, 'royal' idea, quite congenial with the motto of internationalism. But it historically occurred so that the Russian people had been accustomed to take the</page><page sequence="21">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 361 expansionist and other imperial functions as 'natural' and regular features of the State (in other words, as structural characteristics of the political institution, providing stability to the social system). As a matter of fact, the same idea, broadly designated as 'Oriental despotism', always found an even stronger and more organic echo in all of Asia. This circumstance was well reckoned on by the Tsarist government, in planning their 'Asiatic policy'. One of its best examples was Dorjieff s mission to Tibet, followed by the Tibetan delegation being sent to St. Petersburg, and a "... secret treaty arrived at between Russia and the Dalai Lama, in which the former assumed the suzerainty of Tibet and protectorate of the Lamaist religion".6 By that time, the image of the 'White Tsar' was associated with the Bodhisattva Maitraya, the Buddha of the future (Later Nicolas Roerich, less successfully though, tried to do the same favour for Lenin), and Russia was identified as Shambhala, the promised country of the future. All these passes resulted in the Anglo-Tibetan war of 1904 which, almost coinciding in time with the Russian-Japanese war, cut short the imperial pretensions of the Tsarist government in Asia. Obviously all three sides in the conflict realized that the 'cosmocratic' principle could be of no less importance as a political force in 20th century Asia than it used to be in Europe in the 15th century (when it was so effectively employed by Ivan the Third). In their policy of rapprochement with Russia, the Tibetans followed the legacy of the great Fifth Dalai Lama who reminded his subjects that Tibet acquired its role as symbolic centre of Buddhism owing to the protectorate policy of the powerful Mongolian Emperors, Kubilai and Gesar. Russia and Eng land, on their side, also understood the importance of Tibet as a symbolic centre of Buddhism, then the most 'populous' religion of Asia and of the world. It seems not improbable that similar considerations may become operative in the future, provided that the appeal of strong political power remains workable in 21 st century Asia (which is quite probable, in view of imminent over-population, hunger, and other social problems). And this is exactly where the Communist mission is primarily directed. To the extent that political factors are growing in that part of the world, the Communist aspirations are steadily turning from Europe to Asia and neighbouring areas. As a matter of fact, it was the original idea of Lenin that "Commun ism will come to Paris and London via Shanghai and Calcutta"; but it is only now that his idea is acquiring its real imminency. There seems to be no doubt that economics remains the main system-maintaining factor in</page><page sequence="22">362 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN Western societies, as political power is in the Eastern ones. In this regard, the Soviet policy-makers are obviously losing a great deal of interest in keeping the Communist movement in the West under their unconditional control and are concentrating their main efforts in Asia and Africa. The source of the Soviet-Chinese competition is revealed by this circumstance, and the outcome of their struggle mainly depends on which of the two Communist giants is able to meet the symbolic expectations and display a strong political action. It seems symptomatic that the Chinese side, after a series of important gains during the 1960's, is gradually giving up in the complex political and ideological game and turning to domestic problems: both because of military inferiority and the absence of an explicit 'pantoc ratic' tradition in Chinese history. There should be no doubt that in this case we are facing not only an issue of Realpolitik and balance of power, but also a very complex symbolic phenomenon. The Chinese were never tempted by a religious idea similar to Caesaropapism; never did they lay claim to a God-inspired 'pantocracy'. As a result, the incipience of Marxism in China did not stimulate any movement strong enough to accomplish industrialization of the country at any price (as Stalin did in Russia). For the same traditionalistic reasons, Chinese Communism remained extremely ethnocentric, and its claims to world supremacy never could become as serious as those of the U.S.S. R. Thus the present-day situation as regards Realpolitik and balance of power is stimulated by symbolic factors and affected by the peculiar idea of 'cosmocracy'. To understand this idea in its symbolic content, we must turn to Russian history. Obviously, 'Caesaropapism' is only a 'surface-layer' or 'superstruc ture' of a larger cultural complex. The Tsar could never be identified with God or proclaimed as Christ the Cosmocrator Himself. This was proven by the revolution in Russia as plainly as by executing the Tsar for 'treason'. Only in fully traditional civilizations of the 'Asiatic' type could deification of the king be real: though, as a rule, it was accompanied by depriving him of political power (as in Ancient Egypt, China, Peru, and Mexico). But how could the popular consciousness of the Russians in the 20th century extol the abstract principle of'power as such', without the human embodi ment and divine charisma (say, as in Tibet)? The answer is found again in the strong influence of Orthodoxy, especially in that peculiar transformation of Christian religious thought,</page><page sequence="23">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 363 which made the influence of a 'charismatic personality' quite optional, or at least not so strongly psychologically demanded (as a matter of fact, Stalin's cult was an imitation, with a different psychological quality, of Hitler's in Germany). This change can be also explained by the 'eastward' shift of Christianity in Byzantium, especially after the virtual 'anti-symbolism' was laid down as a cornerstone of Orthodoxy. That kind of'anti-symbolism' was neither a position nor a principle. It was a historical process of active desymbolization, stripping down all symbols by their persistent reification and materialization. It was not a result of any hetero-religious (say, Islamic) or heterocultural influence. Byzantine anti-symbolism is a histori cal synthesis of the early kind of'Christian idolatry' of the 6th to 8th centuries - i.e., icon-worship, reminiscent of Ancient paganism - and of its antithetical denial in the Iconclastic movement of the 8th to 10th centuries. The resultant 'anti-symbolism' transcended them both, and thus became deeply enrooted in the popular consciousness as is true of any real historical product. Marxism only 'reminded' the popular Russian consciousness of its traditional way. When the Tsarist charisma was desymbolized and its carrier dethroned, the people tragically materialized their historical power in the Soviet State. In a certain sense, it was also the act of vengeance on the mundane sovereign for 'pretending' to the royalty of Christ (this, for example, was the vison of the October Revolution in the poetry of Blok). But why did this materialization and embodiment of the State power entail the expulsion of God? The question is whether the entailment was real and complete. Perhaps it was just the concluding act of the above-described schema of seculariza tion, with God's lot shrinking to a few human points of the holy and clearing the way for the 'this-worldly' activity ('worldly' in the collective and socially absolutist sense of the Russian 'world' - 'ra/r', "mirskof, i.e., the communal, the collective - rather than in the individualistic and voluntaristic meaning of Western Protestantism). IV. THE SOCIAL AND THE IN DIVIDUAL AS PECTS OF FREEDOM The religious history of both the East and the West is rich with secularizing heresies, started long before the Reformation. But they were never success ful until the historical moment came when the principle of human action,</page><page sequence="24">364 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN directed from the inside out, i.e., presented as a human faculty, was discovered in the individual subject, thus reaching the level of explicit formulation and becoming communicable. In contrast to that, the preced ing heresies of Manichaean orientation (the Bogumils or Messalians, the Albigensians, the Cathars, the Waldenses, etc.) always objectified the conflicting forces of good and evil by projecting them against the external world of nature. As it were from without, these forces penetrated the human soul, leaving for that poor soul not a scrap of essentiality and independence. Man was unable to become internally free and completely good: he had just to defend himself. To make his task easier, the social principle of 'association' was adopted. Insofar as every singular human being is too weak and passive to materialize his own religious aspirations, should not suffering humanity be united into the 'communes of pure life', following the example of the private corporation of the 'brethren and sisters in Christ', presented in the Gospel? The invisible wall of such exclusive 'communes' would protect the 'meek in the Spirit', by allowing each of them comfort enough to defend his weak soul against the always hostile external world, as if to sit out the siege of life behind the palisade of the 'inner communion'. But this is a poor remedy, indeed, and a psychologically inconsistent one, too, speaking in terms of the Manichaean idea of objective reality given as two equally external principles of good and evil. The more means of defence from the outside one creates, the more one suffers, because each of these means can be instantly turned into a potential source of evil. The historical fate of all such 'egalitarian phalanstery' is too well known. Either they were destroyed by the inner schisms, envy, and competition, or schemes of dominance eventually prevailed in them, and the egalitarian 'communes' were turned into 'cells' of hierarchy, with the mechanisms of government and control released for production of totalitarian-state-like formations. Such an outcome does not speak for the 'innate corruptedness' of human nature. On the contrary, it is a result of the originally imposed principle of passive non-subjectivity, because the outside objectification of the two polar forces has happened. It also reveals the 'socializing bias', i.e., substitution of the secular commune (clan, tribe, ethnicity, family) for the Mystical Church as the Body of Christ. No wonder all these prototypes passed through Christianity, metastically penetrated it, and triumphantly resurged as real forces of modernity: the nuclear-family-ism, the national</page><page sequence="25">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 365 ism, and many other parochialisms of today. Therefore, it is hardly credible to assume that the modern Western or Westernized world emerged as a result of secularization of the Christian paradigm: rather it sprang forth through the Christian paradigm, and in spite of it. It also seems unwarranted to presume that the modern world of mass media, similar life styles, same patterns of economy, of technology of construction and destruction, of the common menaces of overpopulation, etc., is getting united and homogeneous. This is because the external factors, malignant or benign, can never force people to unity. Mediaeval Christian Europe, the mediaeval Islamic world, and classical Hindu civilization were certainly more united and universal in their respective ways than the modern West, the Arab countries, and the South Asian subcontinent. The reasons seem similar: they are found in the one-sided 'socializing bias', to the detriment of human self-consciousness and self-confidence. This must be obvious in comparison with the inverse role of the Hindu caste organization or the Buddhist Samgha ('Congregation') both well structured and well-defined in the normative sense, but only to become 'something real to abandon', and thus to make the fruit of renunciation no less real. Consolidation of the social ways and the strengthening of social stability guarantees the reality of human freedom in both ways, i.e., irrespective of the individual's decision to leave society or to stay. But this real autonomy is certainly incompatible with the Manichaean principle of good and evil as two external objectivities. The more amazing is that this principle survived well in the West. It outlined all Catholic persecutions, then influenced the Reformation by imparting to it its specific social accents, and in this way prepared the skeleton of modern Western society. Insofar as the resultant historical composition of Western social thought is a reflection of Western social history, Marxism can be considered as a "na tural antithesis' ofthat history. Over-emphasis on the social, i.e., 'externalized' conflicts, and insistence on the struggle of objective forces as necessitating the preference of community to humanity: these motives are responsible for the genesis of Marxism in the immediate sense. Its genesis can be traced from the Anabaptist Commune of M?nster in the early 16th century to the Alliance of the Equal in 19th century France. It should be pointed out that this aspect of the Communist doctrine, i.e., the principle of 'communal' organization of human existence, is perhaps the only one which Marx did not borrow from Hegel. He took it over as a simple</page><page sequence="26">366 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN reflection of French socialism. The main weakness of Marxism in this dimension is explained by its founder's failure to provide a methodological solution, where individual human activity would be taken into account. The utopianism of the whole Communist project ensued from the insolven cy of the anthropological aspect of Marxism; because Marx avoided the question about the natural alienation of Man, i.e., about the problem associated with his inner subjectivity and the non-idealistic aspects of self consciousness. This means that Hegel is not able to be turned completely upside down. It also means that in this respect Marxism is similar to those heresies of the past in which the problem was originally objectified into the externally polarized, 'naturally' social forces. In this specific form, the problem was encompassed by the activity of self-consciousness, which thereby turned self-conscious enough only to understand the gulf of difference between its aspirations and the 'objective' state of social condi tions. This does not mean, however, that Marx should not include the principle of socialism into his doctrine, and the supporting notions like 'class struggle', etc., into his social critique. Quite the contrary: their inclusion was fully justified by the experience of Western social history and was quite relevant for the analysis of contemporary Western society (in view of the presence of the real historical, cultural, and ideological components of the above-discussed type of'objective socializing' in the matter of Western life). But if Marx correctly detected that component and sensed the real problem of contemporary social reality, his reflection of it and its subse quent incorporation into his theory was, in some sense, a methodological retreat from Hegel. It was basically Schelling's 'principle of identity' that guided Marx' thinking when he, in the manner of the 'philosophy of nature' (i.e., without reconsidering the historical and social reality of his civiliza tion as 'other-being' something 'natural', for example, from the point of view of the 'inner meaning' of other civilizations), granted ontological status to 'socialized' Manichaeanism, by 'potentializing' from it (we use Schelling's terminology as suitable for the case) the notion of 'class struggle' and his whole theory of Communism. As will always be true of a science based on Schelling's 'philosophy of nature', its conclusions can be quite authentic in an analysis of the actual situation; but they dramatically lack the prerequisites for development. Lacking this, Marx had to imple ment the category of 'occasionally' (Lenin's 'good-luck', 'opportunism'),</page><page sequence="27">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 367 not found in Hegel: as it were, the blind force of nature intruding into the course of social events. The most dramatic, nay, the tragic result of this inclusion, and at the same time of Marx' following the 'principle of identity', was, of course, his visualization of the future Communist society as a kind of return, to wit, a coming back to the state of the primitive 'commune'... mysteriously or, rather, occasionally restored at the highest possible level of material and technological advancement. Now it is clear why the Communist doctrine of Marx was doomed to failure in the West. Its alleged victory and objectification in any external form would inevitably unleash the forces of factionalism, greed, and hatred, because the same 'Manichaean' principle would still be in action. To show this, it is enough to see what happened with the Western system of values in the course of what can be approximated as at least one particular aspect of the Marxian promise. The enormous growth of economic prosperity undermined the 'cultural sense' of Western civiliza tion. It can only be guessed to what extent, in this particular aspect, the 'biased' forms of Communism in the Soviet Union should be considered a measure of, and payment for, the 'Westernization' of Russian society. But all this is true only in the external sense. For those in the U.S.S. R. who oppose Marxism, it looks 'evil', because external, something that had come from the West. On this point the pro-Western dissidents and the Russian nationalists (like A. Solzhenitsyn) agree. On the other hand, the majority of the population simply accept Marxism or, rather, the State organized on Marxist principles, because they feel them associated with something in the immanent development of the country, rather than imposed from the outside and therefore 'evil'. A quite different story is that of inner inconsistencies in Marxism, of its ambiguity on the radical point of'natural alienation'. This ambiguity led to tragic consequences when the doctrine was transplanted to an alien cultural context. Marx certainly had solid reasons to abstract some aspects of the Western capitalist society and to infer - seen as in a mirror - what the future Communist society should look like. But there were no warrants that the Communist future in other civilizations would look just the same. Who can assert that the ideal of'progressive socialization' in which the problem of natural alienation is solved in the sense that the society protects the individual against his own self-consciousness (sometimes defined as the 'damnation of being born free') and against unbridled personal needs, can</page><page sequence="28">368 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN be of any relevance in Russia, considering that the principle of objectifica tion of good and evil as two external forces (i.e., the same principle which made the Western dream of Communism so obsessive) did not mean much there? Perhaps the Soviet people would reach 'their' Communism faster, and in a much safer way, if they were not misguided by the Western notion of what Communism is. The question turns us back to the 'inward sense' of Russian culture, to its possible ends. V. MYSTICISM EAST AND WEST AND TH E SCHEMA OF H ISTOR ICAL ACTION But first we have to find out why Marx' projection of Communism could not win in the West either: not because his initial abstraction was wrong (it was quite realistic for his time), but mainly because it was incomplete. The 'socializing' development in the West was barred by the deeply encrusted idea of individual freedom of the will. This idea originated at the other extreme of Western Christianity and was represented by the subjective voluntarism of St. Augustine. First it made for Church establishment and served as a cornerstone of the Western type of religiosity. But later the same idea brought the unity of the Church to desolation. The principle of free will inherent in the individual means that the subject is free in his choice between good and evil. This principle was formulated by Augustine not for its own goodness but mainly as a polemical argument against the quasi-'karmic' doctrine of Pelagianism. According to Pelagius, the freedom of will is not denied, but the memory of every decision made by the subject is 'stored' in his consciousness (or in the 'celestial office'). The individual is always aware of the fact that records of his actions are kept somewhere, and even though no punishment5 from the outside world ever reaches him, the self-afflicted 'psychological compensation' inevitably en sues, sooner or later. In other words, any subjective volitive action leaves behind a slightly objectified 'trace', a 'memory', owing to which the individual always feels slightly 'de-individualized' and conditioned. From time to time, he moves himself into the situation of suffering, most certainly caused by an accident but identified by the individual as 'punishment' for some previously taken decisions and actions which happened a long time ago but were preserved in his memory. It seems clear that this kind of</page><page sequence="29">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 369 reasoning itself precludes the idea of complete freedom of will. The subject, before committing his next act, is forced by simple psychological pressures to 'project' it in his imagination into the future. He would think about the possibe objective consequences, and his actual meditation influences his decision in the present. In modern social psychology this effect is called 'self-fulfilling prophecy', and in Indian philosophies the same effect is described by the mechanics of'karma' (lit 'working the events out'). In contrast to that, Augustine stated that no further objectification and consequences are possible. When the individual makes his subjective choice, he decides himself what is good and what is bad, hic et nunc, i.e., he sanctions himself immediately, and this sanction of his conscience is not objectified in some external mechanism or criterion. Everything remains on the subjective side of the act, i.e., in the consciousness of the 'volitive Robinson'. When acting, he simply expresses his readiness to face all possible consequences of the act. Of course, this attitude is an effective means against 'socialization' and alienation of the individual by society. But it also seems clear that acting after this principle entails the nominal treatment of other things and persons, including God Himself. Any non nominal, in particular, cognitional attitude contradicts the principle itself. This, by the way, was the main reason why Hegel refused to admit that the Anglo-Saxon empiricists are genuine philosophers: their subjective 'liber tarianism' spoke against the appellation. Still, the better evidence for this case is how the word 'philosophy' is used in Modern American society. There it means simply 'what I am willing to do, with the prospect of facing all the possible consequences of my volition'. As long as Augustinianism was confined to ethics and was mediated there by the 'law of conscience', it peacefully co-existed with the Catholic Creed, and even helped to cut down the heresies driving the Church toward the 'commune' (in the sense discussed above). But when Augustinianism penetrated into the sphere of cognition, its individualistic voluntarism appeared in doctrinal form and through the philosophical intermediacy of J. Wycliffe, W. Ockham, and J. Hus resulted in Protestantism of the Calvinist type. The balance was broken: Augustinianism made itself felt as the human will to act, rather than as an argument in ecclesiastical disputes. It was reformulated into the axiological principle, implying the self dif?rmauvepersonality, intuited by the individual and objectively opposed not only to both society and divinity, but also to his own body - the inactive</page><page sequence="30">370 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN vehicle, owing its power exclusively to the individual's will. Thus Adolf Harnack was right when he called Augustine the Tirst modern (= Western) man'. And not incidentally the modern Logical Positivists, who profess the metaphysics of'atomic solipsism', gravitate to Augustine. As a matter of fact, they always substitute the conative principle for the cognitive one; because this latter can be properly realized only in the structure of socialized activity. Augustinianism was peacefully kept in the mold of Catholicism for so long, mainly because it was well balanced bypassive mysticism. This circumstance is very important, in view of the basic difference between all typical kinds of Western mysticism and its Eastern type, which is active. In a sense, Western mysticism had to be passive, insofar as the whole sphere of 'religious activism' was monopolized by voluntaristic Augustinianism. Of course, the historical tradition of both kinds of Christian mysticism can be traced to pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. But, as we shall see presently, the Dionysian 'apophatics' (negativity) was actively transformed in the East into the positive and real Knowledge of God, while in the West it always remained passive and prone to pantheism (like that of Meister Eckhart) or anthroposophy (of Ruisbroek, Tauler, and J. B?hme), which was quite untypical of the Eastern mystics (except for some modernist fabrications of Berdyayev, Uspenskij, etc.). Western mysticism is ecstatic. It is based completely on expectation of the gift from above, on the 'dawning-upon' feeling. Even when such a mystic calls to 'toil and work' (like St. Teresa), it means work only in the 'static', normal condition, between the 'visitations' of ecstacy. Every time, and only when something extraordinary happens to the mystic, he inter rupts his 'work' or prayer and surrenders himself to the unusual experience. This experience is characterized as 'subjective', because the mystic is immediately involved in it: he 'feels', 'observes', etc. In this respect, the 'mystical experiencing' is similar to, and even historically antecedent to scientific empiricism through mediation of its specific 'rules of observance'. As a matter of fact, the principle of Baconian induction can be traced back to certain conditions of the mystical experience. Western mysticism is antithetical to Augustinianism on the level of voice. Augustinianism expresses itself in the active voice of will: Western mysticism, in the passive voice o? cognition, i.e., experiencing. Sense-data appear from the outside and then are subjectivized by the mystic; or, rather,</page><page sequence="31">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 371 he is forced to subject himself to the pressure of external circumstances by calling them 'experiencing'. This is why persons of gentle build with distinct psychosomatic disorders and other abnormalities, including those who once suffered traumas and serious illness, are the most probable and usual candidates for that kind of experience. Perhaps because of this physical conditionedness, passive mystical experience appears as identical in all places and in all times. In contrast, the Oriental mystic is usually a person of strong and even portly constitution and good nature: very much like Plato. He also takes special care of his physical well-being and of the good functioning of his body: like a professional sportsman. As a matter of rule, Eastern mysticism is formative and systematic. Ecstasis (Russ. isstuplenie) is not utterly unknown, but never favored, never considered as something important and worth being remembered, described, and experienced again. On the other hand, as we shall discuss it below, the Eastern mystic claims the uniqueness of his experience not because of its exclusiveness, but mainly in a quite real historical sense. It must be clear that the subject of passive mystical experience neither can nor will try to introduce something of his own historical identity into the 'received' experience. That is why Western mysticism - individualistic in its ways of obtaining experience and univer salistic in the means of its expression - antecedes modern science in the same respects, while the idea of history remains strange to it, as deeply 'profane', externalized in sociality, or associated with the voluntary act of the historical character. In the passive mystical experience, forefeeling and anticipation of the event sharpen the inner sense of time, i.e., that one-sided, subjective time, epitomized as such in Kantian transcendentalism, flowing only from the 'past' into the 'future', i.e., from the moment of the previous 'experience' to the moment of the next expected, and certainly without the actively obtained 'present'. The passive mystical expectation was, therefore, merely 'projective'. It cast into the future what, for consciousness, always was 'experience-turned-past'. Hence, the crisis of'ecstasy', and the urgent need to come out from time-free actuality into time-bound 'existence'. It seems curious, then, that some modern anti-existentialist philosophers (beginning with Hegel and Feuerbach) insisted on the congeniality of their thinking with mediaeval Christian mysticism. They obviously did not realize that that kind of mysticism was not activity itself, but an after-the</page><page sequence="32">372 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN event description of what happened with the subject. As a matter of fact, what Hegel liked most in Meister Eckhart was the idea of experience as meaningful only to the subject; though he seemed quite embarrassed with the perspective of explaining the source of the mystical vision and the meaning of its figure (Gestalt). Perhaps, if Hegel had ever known the Oriental, active and imageless, he would hardly have insisted on his affinity with Eckhart and B?hme. And we would have less conjecture, more evidence for our hypothesis. Perhaps, this was because Western mysticism was non-spontaneous and 'non-self-employed'. It always displayed a tendency to transfer and ascribe its subjective experience to something external: for example, to 'sub stances' and alchemical 'elements', which figured as symbolic correlatives of the mystical states, rather than the immediately experienced mystical realizations. And, of course, this transformability helped recognize such mental operations in their natural quality o? signs known also from ordinary communication, rich in metaphor and other figures. Hence the idea of transformability of 'substances' and 'elements', in a way similar to that of figures of speech, helped to forget that they were originally used as denotations of inner states of the subject. This superposition and transfer ence by analogy gave birth to the basic method of modern experimental science, which could never emerge in the East, exactly because of the 'self activation' of the Oriental mystic: as, for example, in Indian yoga, where the subject works with himself and thus needs no transference and superposition of his schemes of activity onto external things or elements. This circumstance is very important because it obstructed development of the positive sciences. It, of course, made itself felt in full measure in India, owing to the philosophical reflection on the impossibility of finite sciences. But practically the same factor, present in the Eastern Christian tradition of Hesychasm, or the practice of'wise action' in prayer, also played the crucial role in preventing the nominalistic approach to knowledge, in this way foreshadowing Hegel's notion of 'introvertive science'. Most of the Western mystics tried to 'express themselves', to relate their experiences to words (which, as Hegel observes in the Phenomenology of Mind, is an undoubtable feature of buckling under the pressure of external force).7 Not only into the elements of substance but also into the body and parts of language, so to speak, there was importation of the mystical experience. Hence the well-articulated and 'rationally' structured Western</page><page sequence="33">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 373 Christian theology, culminating in St. Thomas Aquinas, was a feature significantly absent from Eastern Christianity. One can easily feel the difference while reading Symeon The New Theologian, the greatest mediaeval thinker of the Eastern Church. No less significant is that in the typical writings of Western theologians, the subjective historicity of mystical experience as of Relevation is elimi nated and replaced by visualizations betraying universal archetypes or mythological patterns (as in St. Teresa or St. John of the Cross), or by strong dependency on the literary tradition, both Patristic and ancient philosophical (the Dominican line), with special accents on the problem of communication (rather than communion), and with the impelling need for announcement, rather than for keeping the secret, of speaking, rather than of acting. The Oriental authors are different. They write mostly about their feelings and reactions to historically discernible things and events. They prefer topics of the day to general matters, following the proverb, 'sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. Sometimes they are amazingly independent of the Patristic tradition, even in their homilies and epistles, though keeping its spirit in complete devotion to the authenticity of the Creed. The need for expression is not so demanding; paradoxes and antinomial formulations are more typical than ratiocinations. This kind of style was not a result of poor scholarship or lack of philosophical method. Both Plato and Aristotle were studied in Constantinople in the 10th century more extensively and deeply than in the West in the 13th century (the corresponding historical epochs of Symeon and St. Thomas). What mattered, however, was that Eastern Christian thought, though more organically following the ancient philosophical heritage in its subjects (which sounded quite familiar because of the sameness of language and common substratum of Greek culture), was at the same time more original and independent of it in its method. This was prompted by the conviction that ancient pagan philosophy had lost all its force of reasoning in the course of history and could not be trusted any more as a means of presenting both the religious issues and the common life experience. This conviction probably made Byzantine thought more open to non-Christian Eastern influences or, rather, to its own creativity. Symeon formulates its attitude as follows:</page><page sequence="34">374 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN It is generally hard to know oneself - and in the present time, and in this generation only very, very few really know themselves and therefore can philosophize. Love for genuine philosophy has withered away, and all are possessed by negligence, because the mundane cares dominate us from within. To the heavenly and eternal we prefer what is wordly, temporal, and miserable, and even something non-existing, i.e., sins. If, I say, it is hard to know oneself, the more is it so to know God.8 This passage (which, of course, sounds very 'Heideggerian' in its main points) is not a statement of a thoroughly 'epistemological' agnosticism, but a kind of historical criticism of the 'rationalistic', philosophical ways of cognition, not bad or defective in themselves, but simply 'deteriorated in usage' (Wittgenstein's idiom), because used by the present, decadent generation. The spirit of this denial matches well the attitudes toward modern Western philosophy found in the Soviet Union (for very similar reasons, Soviet Marxists blatantly reject beforehand all new philosophical attempts as 'bankrupt and impotent'). But it presents in a more correct light the secular air of'secrecy', so typical of the Byzantine, Russian, and Soviet societies. It involves disrespect for all forms of publicity and legal proceed ings: these are all proclaimed mere redundancies, because truth is "some thing which can never be found in court". It is well known that many specifically Russian proverbs (such as 'Untruth is where the court is') are popularizations of the historical 'existentials' of Byzantinism. We mentioned before that, to the extent that the passive Western mysticism and Augustinianism complemented each orther, they both were approved and supported by the Church. But their unification into one theological system, in the logically consistent manner of'rational theolo gy', turned out to be impossible and implicitly contributed to the Reforma tion crisis. The principle of autonomy of will contains the bud of agnosticism within itself. The willing subject does not think about the nature of his existence or about the natural essentiality of other willing subjects. The point of his interest is not to make himself explicit but to find a mediator, a common language, which would delimit the mutuality of all possible manifestations of will. Will is manifested in linguistic conventions, and in the conclusion of treaties as to mutual preventive actions, with each of the negotiating parties able to remain himself, i.e., materially unknowable, and even undesirable as an object of cognition. The individual was thereby perceived as isolated and 'extra-natural'. Only communication seemed natural; but it was</page><page sequence="35">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 375 conventional all the same, because conventionality was suspect in the nature of things. Well then, what kind of policy could be pursued when man spoke not with his fellow-men but with God? The principle of free will in Augustinian theology is not an apostasy of man but it is a clear statement of his abandonment by God. Man is left alone to his own will; and this situation is considered as the initial condition of all his activity. But can he refuse and return his autonomy to God as a gift of reciprocity? as an item of contract? or, simply, can he surrender his will to God? No. He has no way of doing that: his nature is forgotten, and nothing of it is stipulative for the act of volition. Augustinianism precluded the Biblical situation, when man not only talked with God but also cooperated with Him, to the extent of his natural abilities. But now the treaty, codified as theology, or the asserted absoluteness of the human will serve to separate man from God. The passive mystic stays in God only insofar as God wants to keep him. God visits him from time to time and penetrates him; but also abandons without delay. Neither the frequency nor the continuity of such 'visitations' depend on the mystic himself. He knows God, beyond any doubt; that is why mysticism is gnostical. But this knowledge can be lost easily, turned into memory - or it can come back uninvited, as a kind of natural (because non-created, unpredicted) revelation. Therefore, the mystic keeps himself always busy: he searches for God as for a lost thing. He looks for God in himself, in other people, in the world of nature. This, for example, is what Meister Eckhart advised one to do. In fact, we can distinguish two basic forms of reification of the 'past' or 'stopped' relations between God and Man. Either God offers immanently to Man the freedom of will, which man cannot help but accept, because he is doomed to be free. Or there is a possibility of the eternal search for God as for a someting like an 'unknown quantity' without, however, any perspective of staying in His quality forever. The peculiar 'pious agnosticism' of St. Thomas Aquinas is, of course, the most obvious philosophical outgrowth of the second situation. He argues: How can man even try to understand God? to talk with Him? to express His message in a human tongue? He may only strive to obtain all this, but all that he can reach is analogy of language, i.e., nothing compared to the Living God. There, however, was another proposal as to how to know God. Duns</page><page sequence="36">376 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN Scotus recommended establishing a strict proportion between God as 'the Big Thing' and man as 'a little thing'. The standard of proportionality is suggested by the 'genetic schema' of creation. The schema must be invariable, static, and, of course, pre-given, as a pledge of the real knowledge of God. Neither evolution nor activity in God and man are admitted; otherwise the proportion is broken. We might wish to accept this strong disadvantage for the sake of real knowledge; but Scotus'advice is still of no use. If he were the only man created by God, then his immediate knowledge of himself could be multiplied into God's without losing its reality. But, insofar as man is the measure of all things, and people are many, the most consistent solution seems to be the one proposed by Ockham. According to Ockham, God, and the knowledge of God, and the 'essence' of man, and even his freedom of will - everything is conventional, a kind of symbol, not implying the substance and action of cognition. It is just enough to imagine, and then to follow the imagined design, by assuming whatever comes out to be real. The claim of non-conventionality of truth is simply another convention, and it has to be cut off by the 'razor of reason'. It seems clear that, in the spirit of this suggestion, God may stay only so long as He is respected. It was only the matter of time, rather than of principle, to oust him, and this took another five hundred years to accomplish. For what purpose did St. Thomas enquire into the rational principles of the agreement with God if the treaty had been concluded long ago and sealed in the Bible? Obviously, only to re-interpret these principles in the light of his day's problems. But he did not acknowledge that in the open, as Symeon did. Consequently, the logic of his thinking was the logic of things in his time, while God could be easily bracketed as a common denominator. This, however, was quite impossible for Symeon, because his God lived in his time only, rather than in the Biblical time (for details see below). Similarly in Scotus' scheme, the proportion was presented as a means of cognition of one thing as analogous to the other, i.e., as a method of 'physicalist'extrapolation, excluding all variable relations of uncertainty. It was possible, at best, to talk about the voluntary limitation of man's free will by his fellow-men or by conditions of the 'natural order of things'. It sounds almost Stoic and the seeds of Paganism thus crept into the core of Western Christian theology.</page><page sequence="37">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 377 As a result, Thomism developed a theory of secular law, with a nominal God being given his corner of mercy, while Scotism contributed to the development of natural science, and to the later Deistic elimination of the free will of God, because His non-interference in world affairs after Creation was the required condition for making scientific knowledge possible. Gradually, the living God was squeezed out of every corner of His dwelling. God was driven out everywhere, until it was discovered that 'God is dead'. But God did not simply 'die a natural death'. He was withered and mortified. The Reformation principle of justification by faith and the Protestant idea of'labour as your prayer' actually implied the existence of God as conditioned by human faith in Him, on the one side, and human aspiration to activity, on the other. In simple words, what man would put his faith in, that becomes God. Allegiance to the freedom of human will made it necessary to deny the freedom of God's will. Only in negative reflection, in the Protestant idea of Predestination, are the first and the last acts of history left to God. But not the interim and this is why every free willing Protestant is travailed in his spirit, tortured by his conscience. With all his ingenuity, he cannot fabricate a new conscience, cannot save himself. But to make up for it, he is absolutely free to act as he believes he wants to: in either case he will perish. Polarization of the sacred and the secular in this world was completed: there is no God in this world, and he knows that. God will manifest His will in the 'eternal afterwards'. God is not supposed to interfere in the course of worldly events, He cannot shape history as He used to in Biblical times. Man is to do all that, instead of God. Thus, in the modern Western world, actual faith is conditioned by man's deigning to believe and to act accordingly. In other words, his faith is formally free but essentially empty. Though his active attitude toward the world and worldly practices are for God's sake, their reality is mere dissemblance, virtual nominalism. VI. THE SEMIOTICS OF 'EASTERNIZATION': THE ESTHETIC AND THE ACTIONIST CONCEPTIONS OF HOLINESS Now let us trace the development of Eastern Christianity after its decisive break with the West, in order to find out why the trend to restoration of 'Asiatic authenticity' was displayed there.</page><page sequence="38">378 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN The crucial turn of Byzantine Orthodoxy away from the Western type of religiosity, ripe and ready to fall under the blows of the imminent Reformation and Renaissance, was marked by the decree of the Constan tinople Council of 1351, approving Hesychasm and the corresponding monastic practice of'wise activity' and continuous prayer, together with their philosophical and theological foundations, formulated in the teach ings of St. Gregory Palamas.9 It was approval of a specific style of thinking, not only admitting the possibility of God's interference in the historical process and His presence in it, but more simply and directly requiring His incessant action, mediated by selected 'men of God'. At the same time, the role of the Church was interpreted as that of a bureaucratic organization, responsible only for the formal distribution of charisma. In this sense, the radical reorganization of the Orthodox Church, started by Peter the Great and accomplished by the Soviet government, was exactly in the spirit of the Byzantine tradition. The bureaucratic formal organization of the Church stood over against the Councilary Tradition, embodied in a line of selected individuals who were the singledout 'vessels of the Holy Spirit' - honored but co-effective with Its procession through themselves - thus presenting the living ideal of the spiritual life in Christ to every Christian. The full significance of this opposition can be appreciated only by comparison with its ultimate development in Tibetan Buddhism. The Lamaist Church is often compared to Catholicism; but resemblance between them is very superficial, while the coincidence of the role of selected spiritual individuals in Lamaism and in Orthodoxy is by far more impressive, and speaks for our hypothesis of an 'Eastward' turn. Of course, it was not a simple turning away, but the development of a different spiritual culture, within a civilization already quite unlike the West in its final goals and means of activity. The triumph of Palamismcut short the first sprouts of a Byzantine Renaissance. In fact, some of the early Byzantine Humanists were forced in exile to Italy much earlier than the invasion of the Turks. This made reunion with the West impossible, except, perhaps, if the West would have agreed to acknowledge the truth of Palarfias' idea of the holy. Many pro-Western thinkers in modern Russia blamed the 'Palamist revolution' for its obscurantist consequences (for example, P. Ya. Chaadaev, in his Philosophical Letters,0). But Palamas hardly deserved the blame. He appealed to the unconditioned authenticity of faith and rejected all negative and compromising solutions. He sur</page><page sequence="39">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 379 mounted apophatic and agnostic theology, and demonstrated with all possible clarity what the genuine conditions and value of faith are. He proved Orthodoxy as indestructible in its dogmatic foundations, and also not liable to 'popularization' in its essence. The historical time of Byzan tium was counted too short to experience in the full the results of the Palamite 'Easternization'. It was Russia that knew its strong and lasting impact. In his polemics with Barlaam, most probably an Ockhamite and Humanist, Palamas restored the centuries-old Orthodox tradition, coming to him from Maximus the Confessor, through Symeon The New Theolo gian, Gregory of Sinai, and many others. It was the tradition of active thinking, opposed to the static, esthetic contemplation of the form of action, unfolding itself in the perfective, rather than in the perfecting aspect. It is very important to isolate this basic opposition, because, by neglect ing it, we would repeat a typical mistake of many Russian theologians and philosophers who interpreted the Palamist tradition and the whole spirit of Eastern Christianity only in their external form. Practically all Russian philosophers and theologians of the 19th and 20th centuries accentuated the esthetic, i.e., semi-formal, aspects of Orthodoxy. 'Beauty will save the world': such is one of the shortest formulations of their position - by Dostoevsky. The same attitude can be discovered in the socalled 'Sophiology', an idea shared by such different philosophers as Vladimir Soloviev, Fss. Sergius Bulgakov, Vladimir Lossky, Georges Florovsky, and St. Pavel Florenskii, who discussed the mystery of the 'Light on M ount Tabor' and the 'face to face' vision of God, mentioned in the Gospel. Perhaps the esthetics of the Temple played a strong role in their minds. The Temple is an architectural arrangement, it has the pregiven symbolic structure, which predetermines the way of vision and the composition of religious sentiments, by delimiting or even virtually eliminating the free activity of thinking. The same formative function is carried out by the 'philosophizing from the icon', so brilliantly demonstrat ed and defended by St. Pavel Florenskii.11? 12 It includes, first'tender attending' to the image, then contemplation of the icon never realized as obstructing the free activity of imageless spirit, and therefore good enough only for accumulation of efforts of penetrative thought, ready to break through it, into the signless reality of action.</page><page sequence="40">380 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN The essence of Hesychasm, not blatantly iconoclastic but rather 'work ing through' the icon, was never properly understood and adequately presented in Russian philosophical thought. This is quite amazing, because exactly the same spirit of religiosity can be recognized in most of the popular attitudes, for example, as described in the proverb mentioned by Belinsky in his famous letter to Gogol: "A worthy icon is for prayer, a worthless one, for a saucepan lid". Perhaps the maximalist spirit of active and imageless Eastern mysticism was too inconvenient and impossible for the refined and strongly Wester nized Russian philosophers and theologians; otherwise they would not have failed to notice its striking resemblance to the Hegelian, and even Marxist, philosophy of activity especially in its method of "ascension from the abstract to the concrete", so clearly discernible in Gregory Palamas' theory of symbolism. Perhaps they were frightened by the perspective of stretching this semblance too far: so they turned aside, toward the 'theatralization' of'wise activity'. There is, however, an element of quite explainable unattentiveness in their estheticism. Both in Hesychasm, with its idea of'spiritual athletism' (for which only a chosen few may have power enough) and generally in the Orthodox idea of the holy, on the one side, and in the Hegelian-Marxist philosophy of activity, on the other, a particular role is allotted to the spiritual hero, the exceptional personality. One can recall Hegel's cult of Napoleon and his justification of rational despotism in the Philosophy of Right. As a matter of fact, his Phenomenology of Mind is also a story of the appearance, struggle, passion, death, and resurrection of the 'cultural hero'. This is quite comparable with Marx' insistence on the role of the 'hegemon' (individual, class, or party) in the Communist movement, down to its recent repercussions in Stalin's cult. We shall return to this problem of 'heroism' later; but it should be noted here that, yes, only a few have strength enough to be active in the maximalist sense. According to the Eastern idea of personality, not every human being can become a person in deed, not in form, while in the Western democratic society everybody is born to be a 'juridical person'. 'Personalism for everybody' is not genuine personalism, and therefore worthless. The one who is unable to act, is forced to admire the actions of others. It comes out that it is not the case that 'Beauty will save the world'; simply for the outsider, the actions of the world Saviour look beautiful. This external esthetic subject is waiting to be saved, because he is unable to act.</page><page sequence="41">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 381 What are the limitations of the 'esthetic' interpretation of Orthodoxy? The esthetic view is possible on the assumption of a physically or mentally stabilized position, but not on that of motion. Motion and action produce shifting and displacement, and they efface the esthetic impression. Either the esthetic subject 'freezes' the moment by 'attending', i.e., by riveting his sight on what is beautiful, or his sight wanders around and he enjoys the variety of forms by passing from one to the other and looking with wonder at constructions and structures, by entering them with his insightful gaze, by distinguishing the 'external' and the 'internal' in things and taking this distinction for the real principle of plurality; as it were, both these categories are diametrically stabilized and viewed separately. He cannot help but admit the createdness, the ready-giveness of what he sees. The notion of the Way, of the performed action, and of cooperation in creativity escapes him. He is lost in distortions and external relativist effects. In excellent works of St. Pavel Florenskii (in the Inverse Perspec tive, 13 'Falsities in Geometry',14 as well as in many passages of the Pillar and Confirmation of Truth15) one can find many clear examples of purely passive 'positionism' and the geometrical approach to the philosophy of history. This is quite strange for a genuinely religious person like Florens kii, because the error of esthetization is more possible in philosophy than in religion. But even esthetized, positional philosophizing about Orthodoxy is hardly excusable. Florenskii was a great philosopher, but he was prone to descriptivism. Driven by it, he philosophized 'from the icon', rather than from the written text or literary monument as a fixer of culture. This is because he considered the text and literary work natural products of Western 'university studies', which, in their turn, were inspired by the Protestant 'attention' to the Scripture and by the Thomist interest in 'rationalisation'. But are the written sign and the visual image really different? - in particular, for thinking which acts according to recognition and under standing? To follow Florenskii, 'ideas' are 'eidoses', i.e. 'images', 'pictures', rather than 'concepts'. He believed that Face always stands behind Word or Silence. His belief was notionless, because he extracted his esthetic effect of a quasi-religious inversion from the purely artistic impressions, but he never claimed that he is able to work out a way of transcending them. True, Florenskii brought back into the sphere of religious philosophizing the architecture of sacral constructs - dances, symbolism of costume, etc. And,</page><page sequence="42">382 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN of course, by his approach he grasped the splendour of the Byzantine Rite, all the 'class' of Orthopraxy, which once so impressed Prince Vladimir and provoked his decision to baptize Russia. But is that essential in Orthodoxy, as it certainly is in Buddhism (because there it is instrumental for deperson alization)? According to Florenskii and other 'esthetizers', the Annunciation started once and proceeds since then only in Contemplation of the Ascended Lord Jesus Christ, standing on the right side of the Throne in the Temple of Uncreated Light. This Light is structured as the Temple is: that is, for one who enters the Temple from the 'crowd'; for the 'outstanding' one (i.e., for one 'in the crowd') it looks like a burning, non-differentiated 'mass'. This idea was presented by the Russian churches built of white stone, strict and plain outside but containing the liturgically differentiated space inside. To see the 'inside' on earth is possible only symbolically, i.e., through 'images' or 'types', helping in ascension to the non-earthly prototype. To see the 'inside' of the Church is possible only from the side-altar, i.e., from the 'place of Annunciation', 'calling out from the crowd'; because the non invited one, standing in the churchyard, can see only the white wall, too massive to be broken through without blowing out one's brains. So man has to wait patiently, until the Lord of the Temple of Divine Energies would call him inside, before His Face, by singling out his individuality from the crowd. This cannot be done automatically, by the Episcopal distribution of charisma, because the Eternal Energies are non-created, and no 'creature' is able to distribute them at will. Hence this kind of positioning implies the passive, expectant mystical attitude. That is why one who is waiting for a call expects to see the Face of the Anointed Son, the Hypostatic Icon of the Hidden Father, existent behind the word and preceding the tense silence. And His Face looks for the aspirant as the Divine Energies themselves, identical with the Essence but also different from It, preceding the Throne in the Temple and articulated by the Eternal Life as liturgical rites. Here the 'Image' cannot be exfoliated from the 'Archetype'. Just like in the composition of history, there lies the watershed of thought, over which the Resurrected Jesus sends His Apostles to teach, to announce to all nations without exception His 'metanoia', i.e., meta thinking, as submergence into His Name, which is not different from His Name, which is not different from His Essence. Only in this way is Revelation real and undeniable; because it is impossible to insert a razor blade between the 'name' and 'what is named'.</page><page sequence="43">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 383 Of course, nobody can deny the advantages of direct exposition when addressing the audience. By using illustrations, the lecturer does not have to adjust his verbal interpretations to the level of understanding of everybody: each from the audience will do it for himself, to the extent of his ability to grasp the illustration. But information, enunciation and annouce ment are essentially different from creation and from holiness, never susceptible to 'popularization'. The unprejudiced reader of the Hesychast sources will find there little estheticism and much dynamism, i.e., the philosophy of action contradict ing the 'SophiologicaF and Personalistic interpretations of Orthodoxy. Perhaps any kind of estheticism carries the seeds of 'popularity' in its core. This is because the esthetic judgment is subjective in its source. To take the position of the judging and perceiving subject means to stay fixed in front of the esthetic object: and doing this already has something generalizing in it. Everybody who looks at the esthetic object would express his opinion in a different way; but the object itself remains indifferent and non-corrective, regardless of whether anybody is standing in front of it and opining. Were the object able to change its essence depending on whether someone is looking at it or not, there would be no esthetics at all. With the full understanding of this possibility, the sense of'calling' in Hesychasm is presented as not anteceded by 'expectation', though some how connected with the 'spiritual athletism' ( Palamas' idiom) of those who have been chosen to do the work, i.e., presupposing that the work of his active thinking will be done anyway, and by this call of trust the worker is raised up to the rank of the Co-Artificer, Co-Labourer of the Trinity, and Co-Regent of the King in His Kingdom, from the level of idle spectatorship or simple calling. The calling itself is less important than the intention to do God's work. Hence one who is called is expected to be active to the utmost of his capacities; which means to be co-energetic with God. Such thinking never occurred and, consequently, was never described in Western philosophizing theology, lost in the pious agnosticism of St. Thomas (despairing even of communicating, to say nothing of cooperating with God, and thus following the apophatic way of pseudo-Dionysius), in the venturesome voluntarism of St. Augustine (not only unable, but simply unwilling to know what God is doing), or in the shaky symbolism of all Protestants (who plan actions but never reach the end of their original planning, distracted by the demanding need of reinterpretation). Strange</page><page sequence="44">384 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN to say, the same idea of doing to the utmost of one's capacities is found in the Communist creed. Palamism, in a very specific sense, is a. planned technology of holiness. This feature of Orthodoxy looks startling to many Christian theologians. One need not be a narrow specialist in the field to notice a striking technical similarity between the continuous Hesychast prayer, and concentration of sight on the navel ('omphaloscopy') and "repumping the soul from the solar plexus ('omphalopsychosis') to the mind, and final submersion of the mind into the heart",16 and Indian yoga. But certainly more important and confusing than parallelism in these technical details is coincidence of many philosophical principles of both systems. Its very dullness precludes any suggestion of borrowing or cultural influence. Details can be borrowed, principles are discovered. It is well known that Pata?jali's yoga is the only theistic philosophy of all the six Hindu systems of thought.17 Its theology includes such notions as 'synergy' (samskara), 'procession of the Spirit' (avatara), and even Grace (karuna): the compassionate Rama meets his endeavouring devotee and helps him in his final efforts. Perhaps there should be suggested not a borrowing but an independent reproduction of the common archaic prototype of the 'heroic complex', more ancient than both Indian yoga and Christianity. The essential here is the common method of speculation, consisting in the 'tiered' work with self-conscious ness, multiplying and 'socializing' itself, then distributing its appearances over the hierarchical levels, and finally taking them all into itself, by reflection of its intermediary realizations. This method can be called the 'Oriental', or'totalizing' way of thinking. It is found in Indian yoga, especially in the Buddhist Yog?cara,18 as well as in Palamism. But for anyone familiar with Hegel's dialectic and its development in Marxism, even this short description would suffice to show the affinity: though, of course, without any demonstrable material connection. What is essential for us now is that such an ancient stratum of thinking was manifested in Orthodoxy, in the course of the historically real effort of turning the 'modal' Christian religiosity 'from the West to the East', with the accompanying cultural and social shifts. Now we shall analyze the inner dynamics of this effort by scanning the development of Hesychasm by some of Palamas' predecessors.</page><page sequence="45">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 385 VII. HESYCHASM AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF POWER IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Maximus the Confessor lived in the 7th century, when many heresies that had been tearing Christianity to pieces were temporarily muted. He had to protect Orthodoxy only against Monothelism (the doctrine of'one will' or, rather, one end, in the two natures of God: human and divine). Maximus sensed the major danger and the main bias of Monothelism, this objectified homologue of Augustinianism. Two natures in God's unity of will, i.e., in His unity of action (true, Augustine was not so much interested in the nature of God: he believed that, since the unity of will is presented by God to Man, the problem of God's nature lost its relevance): does that not mean that, in the complex reality of the Trinity, there is hidden a dead body? an apparition? or, to wit, a 'mannequin', an automatically controlled 'dum my'? All these alternatives are found in the folklore of many peoples and are richly represented in literature (in Russian literature, the problem was sensed most deeply by Gogol). The most transparent philosophical and religious repercussion of the same idea in Hindu and Buddhist thought is associated with the cosmotype of 'purusha' the'littleman'or double of the self-conscious subject (?tman), different from it in nature but one in action, because the will of the spiritual subject animates the corporeal 'purusha\ In Mah?yana Buddhism we find the concept of the 'Apparitional Body', one of the Three Bodies of the Buddha. This particular Body helps in individua ron of the enlightened person by echoing his 'call for cognition' (aj?a). Maximus admitted that the body of every individual is active and thereby divine. He erased the dividing line between humanity and divinity, by proclaiming deification ('theosis') a real and embodiable act. The Monothelites factually tried to reanimate corpses: perhaps, in manner similar to the well-described practices of Tantric Buddhism. Externally, i.e., from the esthetic point of view, the reanimated corpse cannot be distinguished from the living person. The dead can call for the living, initiate them to the mysteries of Tantra, etc. And the living do not have the criterion to know whether the one who calls is dead or alive, whether the call is real or just a play of imagination, an invention of the waiting mind, etc. Hence the problem of'Face' and 'Mask', in their dialectical display, is moving to the forefront. In Russian philosophy this problem was discussed</page><page sequence="46">386 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN by Florenskii, but long before him, by Ivan the Terrible. To wit, the dead man must be hollow from behind, though nobody can see that: but, this is impossible in the same sense as to see one's own back. Thus the esthetic approach is of no help: the judging subject cannot bring a bit of esthetic evidence that he himself is not hollow from behind. The only truth which he holds is that of considering himself alive because he is able to act. But this truth has nothing todo with esthetics. That is why God needs the human 'synergy', to become the Living God. Maximus proclaimed this as the fundamental principle of Orthodoxy. Two natures cannot have one will, and if a certain man is unable, or, rather, incapable of 'theosis' by exertion of his own will, God is also unable to resurrect him. It is extremely important that, apophatically Maximus attacked only willfulness (by denying its cognizability). But he did not doubt the reality of the body, because he trusted in its prowess. From Plato he knew that the whole cosmos is a body; therefore, each of us is cosmically incorporated into the real. This leaves the external, the exceptional, and the hollow without place in the world of positive actions. Nature is good, because it does not tolerate vacuity. But this statement, as everything in Plato, is only a possibility; i.e., something 'ought to be', for Plato's sake. There is some place for belief (in this 'ought to be'); but there cannot be any room for the concrete mindful reflection of activity, because it demands actual vacuity, to let thinking hold its sway in the other-being of Nature. From Aristotle, Maximus knew that, let the world be embodied as a possibility, still every human being must be actual because he is the purpose-positing substance. But even though I know myself as actual spontaneity, how about the other? how about God? Here Plotinus predict ed, and Dionysius indicted the solution: just try to deny the other's will as active; if you succeed, then the place of the other is empty and you saw an apparition of yourself, which you did not and could not cognize. But Maximus introduced his own momentum into this argumentation. The will of God cannot be denied if His Body is real. And the Body is real only if It is tangible, visible, audible, cooperative. But this is so only from the 'passive' side of the problem. All events in the world are real only insofar as they happen between real bodies, in relations noted as encoun ters of their meeting parts. And if /happen to be one of these meeting parts, it means that on me is focused the justification, and in me is found the knot</page><page sequence="47">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 387 of problems of world history. My testimony of encounter with God is something more than proof that His will is undeniable and His Body is a real body of the Living God. 1 am testifying not only that God is not dead, but also that it is impossible to mortify Him, because I will not let it be done. Simply speaking, when meeting God, I am making Him real and alive. By this new departure, Maximus discarded as 'mythology' and 'pagan ism' all the 'cosmicized' versions of primitive Christianity, from the Gnostics to Origen. He also scorned as 'mythology' the preceding history of Christianity, all composed of cosmically accidental, non-eventful analo gies. One should not permit this apparition of history to overpower the individuality of man's presence. Even in the physiology of vision, the impossibility of seeing an absolutely unknown body is accepted as a well established fact. In the case of a real meeting with God, in the face to face' encounter, His Face cannot be seen, His Voice cannot be heard, His Call cannot be recognized and responded to. Maximus indicated this point clearly: esthetizing Christian philosophy is vacuous and non-authentic. All the esthetic judgements about God are in fact judgments about something different. Consequently, it is completely a matter of the conscience of the subject not only to desire the meeting, to believe in it, and to expect the call (mere belief is not enough: the call has to be materially induced upon the subject by the active strain of his anticipation), but also to shape the first and the last reality of the world by his cooperation in making the meeting happen. Maximus and his followers not only admitted the materiality of the body but also believed in it as the only reality. For them, there was neither mind nor body in separation: the body was one, and that body was wise. On this point, Maximus decisively differs not only from Plotinus and the Dionysian apophatics, but also frompassively cataphatic Christian mysticism. Thus the main philosophical feature of Hesychasm was taking the body as the immanently active, purpose-positing substance - which means transcendence of apophatics. Then surely we may name Hegel as the philosopher of modern times who is exceptionally close to Hesychasm in method, to spare the obvious difference on the theological level. Still, all this sounds strange and incredible; but, considering the method and results of creative forms of suppression (Aufhebung in Hegel's language, Russ. snjatie), of Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus in both cases and, above all, of</page><page sequence="48">388 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN putting what was taken off into action, this judgment appears more grounded. One may even agree with Nicolas Berdyaev that in Hegel, Western philosophy eventually became Christian in its essence (i.e., in philosophical method) when the philosophers themselves were about to abandon Christianity. In contrast to this, philosophy was in the making in Byzantium when the philosophers were most actively and deeply Christian. Though Berdyaev's remark is only an external observation, the same inner logic makes explainable and symptomatic the drift of some of Hegel's followers towards the substantial anthropological materialization of his philosophy. In particular, this is true of Feuerbach's analysis of the mystical visions of Jacob B?hme and the young Marx' preoccupation with the matter of human activity. Insofar as by his new departure Maximus obviously denied the 'cosmic' and 'mythological' aspects of Christianity and insisted on the historicity of meetings of concrete and separate humans with the Living God, his departure looked somewhat familiar and could be easily identified as restoration of the Prophetic idea and the spirit of the Old Testament. To scrutinize this suggestion, we should turn to the movement of the so-called ' Judaizers',20 widespread in Russia by the end of the 15th century, because this movement incorporated many ideas of Maximus. The heresy of the Judaizers is particularly interesting as the first explicit ideology of the Russian autocracy, and for this reason it was at first promoted by the Great Prince of Moscovia, Ivan the Third, whose political genius is still underap preciated by the modern historians. It is interesting to point out that the Judaizers inferred their support of the autocratic secular power not directly from the Christian 'cosmocratic' idea but as one of the consequences of their turn to the Old Testament, with its typically 'Hebraic' idea of God as the Lord, the Power as such. Of course, that was only a consequence, a corollary, rather than a principle. The Judaizers accentuated the role of the Prophets as chosen mediators between God and the people, but mainly as 'delegates' and 'electors' who were responsible for conclusion of the 'treaty' between the two sides and also kept their eye on maintenance of the order established by the treaty'. If taken abstractly and out of the corresponding religious tradition of Orthodoxy, the teaching of the Judaizers in some important points resembled Western Protestantism (which, in a sense, was also a return to the Old Testament). In particular, it was to them, rather than to the Old</page><page sequence="49">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 389 Believers, that we can ascribe the doctrine of the 'autonomous human will' (in their language, the 'autocracy of the soul'). But there is not enough evidence to identify them as 'Russian Reformers'. True, they were anti Trinitarians but exactly in the same sense as Maximus was in his disputes with the Monothelites. They believed that the Body of God is one and active. They were iconoclastic, because they refused to identify real actions of will with 'prototypes'. They were against monasticism as a formal activity, because they denied that the taking of monasticvows makes the person a 'prophet', a 'hero of the Spirit'. Like Maximus, they criticized the doctrine of the resurrection of thedead exactly forthe reason that God cannot do it withoutman'scooperation. Their attentionto the body was even more explicit than that of Maximus. But there was something in their attitudes which went astray from the spirit of Orthodoxy and pre-determined their tragic end: the leaders of the Judaizers were executed by Ivan the Third in 1504. This 'something' was their rationalistic attempt to present the quality of power and 'autocracy' of the human will as inherent in every individual, at least as a potency. In this way they were unintentionally heading in the same direction as the Western Reformers. And although they offered their rationalistic justification of the royal supremacy to the Russian Great Prince, their offer, after a more attentive consideration, was rejected. In fact, it implied that "... every man can become a king and a prophet". To prove that, they went quite deeply into an anthropological symbolism, similar to that of the Jewish Kabbala (a direct influence is not excluded).20 This, of course, was against Christo centrism, and the 'super-Judaizers' were punished: not because of their predilection for the Hebrew Prophets, but simply because they pro pounded the idea of Power, instead of Power itself. Thus we have sensed again the stumbling block of Christocentrism, as something essentially different from anthropocentrism of any kind. But in the first instance we were facing the problem of its expulsion from the Russian popular consciousness, while now we have to discuss the motives of its preservation in the same consciousness, presumably as a means of opposing the Russian Orthodox idea to the universal spirit of humanism. VIII. THE CHRISTOCENTRIC PREDICAMENT: AN ANTINOMY OF MEANING AND SIGNIFICATION To answer the question why the predicament of Christocentrism is as</page><page sequence="50">390 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN antinomial as it seems to be, let us pursue our analysis of the Hesychast tradition and see how the problem was approached by Symeon The New Theologian. Again it was done in the living and acting mode, rather than in the esthetically immovable, 'iconic' mode or in the sense of universalizing rationalization. In other words, Symeon (10th century) accentuated the cardinal motifs in Maximus, overshadowed by the defectors. Among these, we shall first discuss the dialectic of Word, Image, and Prototype. Face and Image are well correlated; but their correlation is burdened with Platonism, so it cannot pass into the concreteness of life without the supporting substance of Prototype. To decry Face, the force of perception must be stilled and pacified. What is needed here most is the feeling of semiotic conventionality, or 'stage distance'. It was not without reason that Khomyakov, the first Russian philosopher of the new type, after having read his fill of Hegel and passively assimilating his style of thinking, presented the Trinity as a "... theatre".21 Thereby, he unintentionally confirmed that on some points the old Judaizers were right in their critique of the Orthodox formulations. The essence of the Trinitarian activity lay, as it were, in exchanging glances between the Three Faces and in giving and expecting the cues. Amazingly, Khomyakov's guess was, as a matter of fact, accepted and further developed by the ensuing Russian philosophy. Of course, the essence of the Trinitarian action is cooperation, 'syner gy'. You have to help the One Whom you are taking into your heart, by 'mental prayer', to get incorporated into your body, without expecting His call of help. In a word, it is your special duty to prevent the Crucifixion and the Passion. But neither a thought, nor a thing, nor even less a Face which already is can be interiorized into the body. In modern social psychology, 'interiorization' is described as a psycho-mental process, a 'symbolic', rather than 'essentially' material action. Word and Image are given by culture, reflected in the logical structure of language. Needed for the communicability, and thereby for maintenance of the physical body, they are just auxiliaries. In virtue of their own nature (which is to be expected and recognizable), they can approach the subject only from the outside' i.e., as 'things'. Therefore, neither Word nor Face can be interiorized otherwise than after being emptied of their essence by thinking, which is properly called 'symbolization'. On the other hand, without word and preliminary knowledge, the subject would be unable to recognize that he is being called upon. That is why we can read in the Scripture: "Knock and</page><page sequence="51">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 391 the door will be opened to you".22 Or, with more insistence and philosophi cal explicitness, in the Buddhist Tantric text: "Tantra is an impatient knocking at the door of Buddhahood".23 In a sense, Communism also can be described as a premature insistence on something impossible so far but expected to be forced to become real. But nothing will come to being out of the esthetic interpretation of the Divine Light, which is structured for the one who 'arrives inside the Temple', and non-structured (like a burning, non-differentiated 'mass' for the 'outsider' (Russ. oglaSennyj, kromeSnyj). Not incidentally, in the New Testament we find this expression: 'outer darkness' (Russ. Vma kromeSna ja). If everything, taken by itself, is structured and architectonically arranged, with space alloted for awaiting the announcement and call, this means that the Church precedes the Holy Act. And this precedence is positively confirmed by the schematic parallelism of the Two Testaments. But this is exactly what is denied by the yogism of 'continuous prayer', transcending the natural structuredness of the body and the compositional parallelism of history and the art of action. It seems almost certain (as we shall demonstrate below) that Ivan the Third rejected the solution of the Judaizers (who actually appealed to this parallelism and, like the Protes tants, preached 'restoration of the ancient ways') because of the sober calculation of the political actor, rather than as prompted by religious intuition. What was the cardinal point ofthat celebrated 'yogism'? The Yog?cara Buddhists, for example, were advised by the great Asanga to look at the blazingly white wall continuously, for many weeks and months18 and not to set it apart or to detect sculptural figures and images on its surface. The yogin does not ram the wall with his forehead: he burns out his own ability to design (cetana), behind the wall of his forehead. All such 'designs' (or, in the Christian yoga of Hesychasm, simply 'thoughts': noema, Russ. pomy sel) arrive from the outside, and the human faculty of thinking provides a mechanism for their conveyance. Both Symeon and Palamas agree that all 'thoughts' are, without exception, from the Evil One; therefore, all bad. But Satan himself can never abide within the human soul: this is what the Bogomils, or the Messalians, insisted on - and Palamas once was accused of the same heresy, obviously without grounds. Both the Yogacaras and the Hesychasts were doing self-exaltation. Their self-exaltation was active, without prototypes and paradigms, because for</page><page sequence="52">392 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN them, constructive activity was both the Alpha and the Omega of existence. In the insistence on imageless activity as the 'nature' of self-exaltation and in the presentation of self-consciousness as both object and instrument of cognition, it is again not difficult to discern a similarity between the Yog?caras and Hesychasts, on the one side, and Hegel, on the other, perhaps also because the schema of Hegel's philosophical 'athletism' has many anthropological features in common with the practice of ancient shaman ism, underlying all these instances. The imageless action is in no case a denial of Image and Word. The sphere of language is considered real because it has to be transcended, before entering the world of action. Any vision is associated with language; but vision is not the supervision of knowledge. Symeon writes: ... when you hear about the light of knowledge, you should not think this is just thinking without light; for it was not named calling or the word of knowledge - no, but the light of knowledge or the knowing light, because this light begets knowledge in us.24 On the other hand, ... thought (noema) appears when some word or design of the good or evil action is begot in our mind.25 Every word, so to say, is connected with subjective positioning for action ('good' or 'evil'), and it always implies a response or judgement about what has been expressed by that word and transferred onto the person of the speaker. The real Word, however, is meta-personal and meta-verbal (in the subjective, that is, expressive meaning of these terms): ... when the man of spirit speaks, he does not speak on behalf of himself, he obviously gives way to the idea that one man can know something in the other man, nay, not only to know, but to be in him what is the essence of God ... But it should be clear that, even though they, i.e., these men who bear the spirit, use words similar to those used by the ancient God-bearing ('theoforof) Fathers, they undoubtedly speak from the Spirit asproperly ensconced in them; therefore, the one who does not believe them and blames them, he is the sinner against the Holy Spirit who speaks in such men.26 It is clearly indicated in the Gospel that the only sin which cannot be forgiven to man is the sin against the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is imageless, because all words and images provoke judgments of similitude</page><page sequence="53">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 393 or difference, and in this way induce various seductive thoughts and assertions, as if it were only in the Biblical times that holiness had dwelt in men, but not now, in the present state of mankind as that of desolation (unless the Biblical ways of life are restored, as the Judaizers thought) and unconditional damnation (as the Protestants would say). The historical context of such assertions is, of course, fastening one's eyes upon the letter of the Scripture (the 'Judaizers', like the Protestants, not only were interested in the Kabbalistic divination of the names of God in Scripture but also were fervent propagandizers of literal interpretation and rational theology in Russia), with the ensuing presumption that the person who is able to interpret the letter of the Scripture in a logically consistent way, thereby becomes integrated as an unquestionable personality. To fight 'personalism', Orthodoxy did not resort to something like the Buddhist theory of rebirth and the mechanism of karma (the last, and very cautious attempt ofthat kind was undertaken by Origen in the 4th century and remained uncondemned!) For the individual who carries the Spirit in himself, this theory is unnecessary (by the way, the same is true in Buddhism, for the Bodhisattva who has successfully attained his goal and thereby superceded the law ofkarma). Instead, the notion of sin was radically reconsidered, together with the dependent ideas of crime and punishment, as well as of condemnation for intentions and/ or real acts. According to genuine Orthodoxy, the Holiness of Spirit is attainable by everybody: but not in the 'extensionalist' sense of the 'average man on the street' (as the rationalist theologian would claim). It is attainable in the 'intensionalist' sense, i.e., regardless of the degree ofdegradation, for the person 'bogged down in sin', and righteous in that condition (we should here recall the description above of the 'anti-structure', viz., "to sin shamelessly, inveterately...). (See pages 12-14). This important reconsideration was rich with dramatic consequences. So let us look at it with more attention. The one who says that at present it is impossible to receive the Holy Spirit internally, who blames the actions of the Holy Spirit by saying that such actions are from the devil, he introduces a new heresy into God's Church... The abuse of the spirit cannot be absolved to men either in this age or in the future. And to abuse the Holy Spirit means to ascribe the actions of the Holy Spirit to the devil.27 In this cultural idiom, formulated by Symeon, we have, as it were, an</page><page sequence="54">394 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN inversion of the Protestant idea of the predestined and of eternal damna tion. Damned are those inactive in the Spirit who always wait to be called, who believe in fixed eternal criteria of good and evil, as well as in their 'personality', once and forever marked by its fallen condition. He who says that in these days there are no more people who love God and can be honoured to receive the Holy Spirit, and thereby to become the children of God, in consciousness, empirical consummation and visualization, perverts the embodied Household of our Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ, by his blasphemous denial of renovation of the image of God and human nature, once corrupted and mortified by sin.28 Words are atemporal, images are out of time. They are good only for the historical interpretation of what is being done 'in these days'. Of course, this interpretation may go in many ways. Symeon continues: Although the Word announces in many ways and shows many directions which would enable man to reach the Kingdom of Heaven, in fact, there are not too many ways; indeed, just one way divided into many, according to the force and willingness of each one who tries.29 While each of us commences his specific business and action starting, as it were, from different locations, we are still striving to reach the same place, i.e., the Kingdom of God. This means exactly that the actual condition of the one who endeavours is not of importance. Symeon, and after him Palamas, denied that, "... beyond silence and non-silence, there is a Face waiting in the Temple of Light". It only appears so externally, in annunciation from the 'outer darkness', i.e., because of merely structural contrast. As a matter of fact, there is no division into the external and the internal: all is one activity. In this respect, Symeon's criterion of attainment strikingly differs from that of Meister Eckhart who exclaimed: "The Kingdom of God is close: it is inside of us! " - "Not only close!", Symeon would retort, it is actual: its significance is the activity of its creation, regardless of the 'inside/ outside' opposition. Here is what Symeon thinks about the signless and imageless, beyond the exterior/ inte rior activity of the subject, presupposed by the significance of Christ: But in what place, in which part of the body, you think, can Christ be imagined? in the face? or in the bosom? No: but in our heart can He be imagined ... Just like the woman, whose womb is not empty, knows it clearly because the infant in her womb moves distinctly, and it is impossible for her not to know what she carries in her womb: so the one who has imagined</page><page sequence="55">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 395 Christ in himself knows His movements, and H is leaps, that is His radiance and splendor, and thereby he sees the imagination of Christ inside himself. As the light of the lamp can be seen in the mirror, so Christ is seen in him, but not like the phantasmal, non-essential ghost of the mirror, no, Christ is seen in him like the all-essential, energetic light, the visibly invisible and inconceivably conceivable, in the imageless image and by the sightless sight.30 Although 'words', 'images' and Christ's Face are mentioned here, they are used only as elements of the object-language, located only in the text of description but not in reality. The actual Light of the Spirit, the Light on Mount Tabor, is not related immediately to the Face of Christ, because it shines only as a precondition for the knowing soul. The one who having thus been born by the grace of the All-Holy Spirit, leaves this world as a kind of dark womb, and enters the mental heavenly light, and somehow penetrates that divine light, he is instantly overwhelmed by unspeakable mirth and joy, shedding sorrowless tears when he thinks about the bondage of darkness which he liberated himself from, and about that shining light into which he imagined himself entering.21 The meaning of this uncreated light is clear again from Indian yoga. By concentrating the whole energy of the body in the cerebral centre of pleasure, the yogin can cause his own physical death, by forcing haemor rhage in the adjacent centre of breathing. It is well known that by no effort of the conscious will can the living subject kill himself with his own bodily means. Hence we have here the the only case of transcendence of the bond of created will. In the moment of death, the yogin sees the radiant light of white lustre, and exactly in that moment he can be brought back to life by the graceful assistance of his divine patron or by his 'hegemon', the instructor of yoga. Turning to the philosophical and ethical aspects of this case, we can see the difficulty which can be, and actually was, overcome by removing the traditional philosophical opposition of perceptible and intelligible entities. This transcendence is immediately associated with the problem of Last Judgment. For the one who has conceived the real meaning of the illustrious revelation, and who thereby has transcended his perishable personality (or, rather, personification), the contradiction between the perceptible and the intelligible is sublated. Everything which seemed to be perceptible, vanishes, and the intelligible, the mental, appears in its stead, alone as it is, and reaches materialization in an extra-temporal condition:</page><page sequence="56">396 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN ... the Lordly brilliance will outshine and cover this perceptible sun, so that it will not be seen at all; all the stars will fade, and all the visible world will roll up like a scroll; by moving away it will give place to its Creator.32 This prophecy exactly corresponds to the yogin's description of the highest point of exaltation, ending in the death-bringing haemorrhage (samadhi). We shall return to the subject of this correspondence below, in the context of discussion of the co-called Hesychast 'Christian Material ism'. Now to the most important aspect of our analysis. The main issue of Protestantism, i.e., the question of personal responsibility, emerges in Orthodoxy, at least for those who succeed in realizing the meaning of Doomsday. It will come only to those who wander in the darkness of their personality and still distinguish the perceptible and the intelligible. But, ... they who promoted themselves as the progeny of light and sons of the future, who can always move good-looking in the daylight, the Doomsday will never come to them: because they always dwell in it. For the Last Judgment comes not to those who have already shined forth with the Divine Light - but it suddenly opens for those who sink in the darkness of passions, who worldly live in this mundane abode and enjoy its wealth. It will come to them by surprise, all of a sudden, and it will appear to them terrible like fire, unbearable and insufferable.33 Consequently, punishment is intended only for those blind and thought less in Spirit. This conclusion corresponds to the Communist principle of the 'revolutionary sense of justice' (pravosoznanie): "For one who cannot, we shall teach him; for one who will not, we shall force him". In fact, this principle underlies the whole mechanics of the Communist promise: the future 'kingdom of justice' will come only when all and everybody would thoughtfully establish the standard measure of their 'needs'. For those who succeed in finding this measure, history is finished and the promised future has come; correspondingly, personal responsibility for their further actions is removed. In other words, they are freed from all blame and judgment. How this status can be attained, and whether it is attainable at all, both remain unclear. To reach the required clarity, we must first analyze the conceptual structure of'judgment', in its connectedness with time in the schema of history, and with the problem of transcendence of this schema in the concrete liberating effort. The summit of our discussion is found in Palamas' theory of symbolism. This is the main issue of philosophical</page><page sequence="57">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 397 divergence between the punctilious Western nominalism, with its static map of empirical concepts and logical introduction of the problems of time and 'judgment', and Eastern 'surrealistic' dynamism, in which both prob lems are sublated. Palamas objected against Barlaam's Platonist opposition of the ideal and the material, in the sense that the ideal was presented as possible for cognition only in symbols and analogies of the 'relatively perfect' hierarchy of creatures, with projection of the highest observable forms of existence against the 'shifting screen' of the unknown ideal. Or it was presented in the morphogenetic way, with serial substitution of meanings or denotata of the symbols in a stable schema of enquiry. Palamas distinguished three kinds of symbols:34 ( 1 ) The natural symbol (symbolonphysikon), which "derives from the nature of the object of which it is a symbol"; heat, for example, "is the natural symbol of the consuming power of fire". (2) The symbol which has its own existence, but signifies a nature different from its own and which "nothing prevents from existing before and after the thing it signifies", like waving a flag as a signal to attack. (3) The symbol devoid of proper reality of its own, except for the unique context in which it appears once, like the 'axes of Ezekiel'. The Light on Mount Tabor, according to Palamas, should be considered only as the first kind of symbol, and its 'Facelike' appearance is, of course, its 'natural' quality, perceivable as it is, i.e., regardless of the opposition of 'image' and 'Prototype': just like the 'consuming power of fire' in the case of heat. But this 'naturality' is not the naturalistic giveness of the Face as a physically discernible collection of features. It also can be a historically created unity of what is natural and what is not. When cooperating with God, the individual creates the first symbol of the Spirit, in its primeval materiality. Palamas was bold enough to assert that the Hesychast, by his continuous labour, for the first time creates the real world, the Good Message, and Christ Himself. Everything mentioned in Scripture is phantasy, the 'past', and therefore untrue like dreams. Only the actuality and the future created by the 'athletes of the Spirit', are real or will be realized. Only here and now, and only through the individual's participa tion, is this world of dreams given perhaps its first and last chance to become reality. With clinical assiduity Palamas writes about the medita tor's duty to help the Infant be conceived in the Immaculate Womb, to</page><page sequence="58">398 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN grow there, be born, pass through its life-span, to suffer, die, and be resurrected. With his cooperation, the legend of the Gospel turns real. Of course, this sounds all too 'Indian', but it is not the 'Oriental flavour' of description that is important for us now. What is important is that this extreme outlook was influential in history. It was exactly where the great watershed of thought was plotted. The opposing view, of non-material and non-active symbolism, of the merely descriptive or indicative one, pre vailed in the West, developed by Ockham, grew through the Reformation, and resulted in the conventional, relativist world of today, in which the material and the spiritual are parted altogether. The creature was branded by its 'createdness', and thus exposed to blame and sin. This kind of createdness was evinced in the Catholic bishops, sank in simony and depravity, but was still distributing Grace. The contradiction resulted in the blast of Reformation which denied not only the reality of the bishops' rights to distribute, but also the reality of Grace itself, by reducing it to a mere 'function' or a simple 'index' of faith (as in Palamas' second type of symbolism). In other words, some things were taken for granted, as once created, and therefore not consumable as they really are, and these things were used as reminders of the necessity for believing what is promised in the Gospel - or for feeling guilt in the case of disbelief. The essence and action of things themselves were forgotten, devoid of reality. Palamas was not a Reformer. He did not deny the role of Bishops and of the Church as an Institution. It was hardly relevant for him what kind of people the Bishops were: saints, rascals, or just plain mediocrities. In any case, the Institution was necessary for keeping the only original prerequi site for the holy action - the Sacrament of Baptism. In fact, that was the only real function required of the Eastern Church, to which its perfor mance was eventually reduced in the process of its historical development. Thus in the Soviet era there are by far more baptized than believers in Orthodoxy. As a matter of fact, Palamas insisted on something more radical than Reformation. First of all, he re-interpreted the problem of sin and conviction, in a spirit close to that of Symeon. What was the essence of this problem? If everything that is said about 'sin', 'fear of God', and 'conscience' is by itself unreal, insofar and until it is not put in action, then the Protestant world must be twice unreal, because everybody there knows that he "was conceived in sin and born in filth", and</page><page sequence="59">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 399 hence doomed to eternal damnation in advance, before committing any sin. And insofar as nothing can be done about this 'bare fact', there is no purpose in 'straightening out relations' with God, usually in the vein of the problems'. There remains plenty of time and space for getting busy with science, trade, industry, etc., and only by the whim of personal grace can a few moments be spared for thinking about God, usually in the vein of the celebrated 'Sunday mood'. At first glance, it seems that Symeon and Palamas were suggesting something terrible. The Day of Judgment is suspended and actually never comes to those who 'know the truth'. It means exactly that the Gospel, Past History, and Actions are apparitional, because only the present and the future matter. And they are completely determined by the actions of those 'who know the truth', the collaborators with God. Is it not the same kind of logic that Nikolai Bukharin employed against himself when confessing in 1937-1938 crimes he never committed? He simply believed that the particular fact of his innocence was not so 'true', in the light of his belief in the Communist cause and the Party, as to jeopardize bringing that cause to reality. For Bukharin, his positive chance to contribute to the final victory of that cause was to strengthen popular belief in the infallibility of the Party, by pleading guilty. In both cases, we can sense the idea of'non-createdness', and the suspension of personal responsibility, because of firm belief that the Day of Judgment will never come to the particular individual who 'knows the truth'. 'Knowing through the creatures', including oneself, i.e., taking the nature of man as connatural or rooted in traditions this is what appeared as unreal to that kind of judgment. The past is beyond the reach of the judging subject. By recollecting the past, he thinks and imagines things. But all thoughts are from the Evil One, and therefore unreliable. The past is something, wherefrom the future is projected. Only the present is real, because it is given existentially as it stands. The past belongs to the soothsayers: it is that dusty mirror which, as St. Paul puts it, we have to clean up by our present and future actions. Signs are bridges from the past into the future. But of what use are they for the one who does not have any future? For the one for whom Doomsday never comes? Only the present, whatever it is, deserves our love, and this love must be active and practical. It follows that he who gets down to uninterrupted action, will not stop it for the contemplation of creatures in their relative perfection, or even for</page><page sequence="60">400 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN coming out to the Temple for the common prayer and communion (as the genuine Hesychast almost never did). And exactly this solution was proposed as the cardinal meaning and the most important message of Orthodoxy. The Hesychast monk is not an ordinary Christian. He is a living ideal of Christendom, the embodied presence of the Kingdom of God on earth. Does it have to come at all, if its commencement has been already made visible in this one? But how is the Hesychast's deification possible if it is said that no creature can partake in the Divine Energies? To make this point clear, Palamas added another meaning to the notion of'createdness', and this meaning had a full-fledged impact of historicism.35 The 'natural' createdness of man before the Fall was inherent in his sinless condition. But at present, it is his sinful flesh - sinful in everybody in his own way - that is the real createdness, while the old, exists no more. Therefore, the problem of concentration of the Divine Energies is directed not at the primeval condition to be restored, or at the future, to be foretold. It is exactly the present condition of man which is the seat of all his actions. With his statement Palamas continues and develops Maximus' idea of 'grace', which is quite different from the definitions of'natural createdness', developed in the West after Augustine. Literally, it means that judgment, punishment, and promise are designed only for the 'non-energetic', and therefore, for the 'guilty ones'. But nothing of the kind can ever happen to the 'energetic' hero, because his reality is present only at the moment of his incarnate action. Perhaps, one additional parallel will explain this. The Buddhist law of karma appears as universal and unconditionally real. But this is so only for those who believe in it. For one who has liberated himself from any kind of belief, the law o? karma is suspended. He lives outside the cosmic cycle of births and deaths, in the open world, much like the world of history; perhaps, in the absolutely open world, where both sin and death are sublated. But no less conventional than they are for the Hesychast, the 'spiritual athlete' who operates his own body. For him, all the wisdom of the past, all images of culture are mere madness (cf. the 'Second Triad' of Palamas.36 This hero of resentment, who exposes the apparently normal as insanity, is a quite familiar character in Russian culture, too. There he appears as the God's Fool, the Man of Letters, the Nihilist, the Revolution ary, and the Dissident. In fact, each of them is a link in a single chain,</page><page sequence="61">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 401 started by the Byzantine performer of continuous prayer. The continuous prayer, the gradual accumulation of holiness - this is an incessant reminder to God of man's presence and of his actual immortality, as well as of man's call to God for the 'face to face' meeting. That is why man's place in the hierarchy of creatures is higher than that of angels. Only human power can make the body alive. The body takes part in prayer through its 'wise action'. The body creates its material fruit and thereby rationalizes itself. The body is a materialized mind. Owing to the activity of the body, its flesh provides an inexhaustible source of sanctification. It creates the holy within itself and therefore does not fall under the jurisdiction of reason, because this holiness is not from the mind but from the body. In this way it makes possible that the whole of Christ be generated within us, rather than His symbol or one of His parts, the Face.37 Only under such a condition is the meeting with Him not conventional but material. And exactly for this reason, though it is called a 'face to face' meeting, the Face cannot be seen. And indeed, how can the one who possesses the material organ of vision see his own eye? How can he see his own face without a mirror? That is why the meaning of Transsubstantiation and Transfiguration is one: to turn into oneself, to cease seeing external things and signs with the 'previously natural' vision and to perceive Christ within, to meet Him inside by creating His Kingdom there. This is attainable by the withdrawal into one's self and se If-exaltation. Now it becomes clear why everything that happens 'outside' must be 'anti-theistic'. It becomes ungodly, because we have turned to the opposite. This means that Dionysius' apophatics are over come: the Kingdom we are looking for is made within us. But not inside of the abstract, pronominal 'us', as in Western mysticism; it is within the concrete, incoporated 'me', prepared by 'mental action', so that not only the mind but the whole body creates the Kingdom and Autonomy. This 'inside' is not words or images, or faces, but something material. The famous 'prayer of Jesus' is material, in the same sense as the genuine Indian mantra?2* The subject who meditates on it is automatically pervaded by its rhythm. When his tuning into the rhythm of Prayer is accomplished, the monk may even leave his cell, return to the world, and do there whatever he wants; the world and all its evils will not touch him: so real is the fruit of his active prayer. Palamas explains that the Hesychasts stay in their hermi tages not because they need protection from the worldly temptations (the inner state of the Hesychast's mind is stable, and therefore quite different</page><page sequence="62">402 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN from that of St. Anthony), but mainly because the genuinely liberated individual is a terftptation for the world. The controversial role of some Russian 'elders' (staretz) in the course of historical and spiritual develop ments in the country is well-known. By far more important, however, though almost unexplored, was the influence of the so-called 'crazy wayfarers' (saloput), usually active Hesychasts in the past, who accom plished their training in the 'prayer of Jesus' and abandoned their monastic cells for the world. Roaming the roads of Russia, they spread their religious and existential attitude of the 'verily attained', unconstrained freedom of will (volja) all over the country. It is also interesting to notice that Palamas explains Baptism as required mainly by the mind, too indecisive in its quest of salvation without this guarantee. The body can preserve its own integrity well enough to work out holiness even without the guarantee of Baptism. But insofar as the body takes part in action, it works out salvation for itself and for the mind: because it is the body that materializes the inner Christ. Considering this purely symbolic and mentally delimited interpretation of Baptism and the leading role of the body, some modern scholars define the teaching of Palamas as 'Christian materialism'. Taking into account the nature of his dogmatics, especially the role of antinomies in his theology and the practical way of their being overcome, it sounds almost suitable to call Palamas' approach "Christian dialectical (or at least, 'antinomial') materi alism".39 IX. THE LOGIC O F ASCENT FROM ABSTRACT RELIGIOUS BE LI EF TOCON CRETE POLITICAL POWER IN THE RUSS I AN/ SOV I ET SOCIO-CULTURAL TRADITION We have thus discovered many important points of coincidence: the leading role of the body, the 'obligatory mystique' (i.e., the self-imposed mysticism, as an indispensible pre-requisite of'deification', in contrast to the passive 'natural' mysticism of the ecstatic spiritualists), as well as the genuine feeling for history (i.e., the 'face to face' meeting with Christ, compared to which all the past is only preparation, sublated legend; and the future is mere utopia), together with the doctrine of 'cooperation' ('syner gy'), i.e., socialized activity as the necessary participation of man in God's cause. All these features apparently speak for parallelism with Communist</page><page sequence="63">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 403 doctrine. But the problem of Christocentrism still lingers unsolved. True, the image of Christ haunted the imagination of some Russian poets in the stormy days of the October revolution (Blok, Belij, Volosin), but can it be recognized in the supra-personal, collectivist dialectics of Marxism, em bodied in the Soviet State of today? It seems not. Why not, then? To make this point clear, let us see first how Palamas interpreted cooptation of the individuals into the synergy, i.e., their being'embraced' (perihoresis) by God. One of the most brilliant formulations of Palamas, by which he decisively sets himself off against the agnosticism both of St. Thomas and of the author of the 'Areopagitics', is his grounding of the positive intelligibility of God. Yes, God is mysterious. But He is nonethe less intelligible. The only nuance is that he who has understood God becomes mysterious himself! Can one no longer say that the divine is mystery? Why not? He does not come forth from mystery, but communicates it to others, concealing them beneath the divine shade... This is the most divine and extraordinary fact; the Saints, possessing understanding of God, possess it in an incomprehensible way.40 In other words, Deification is perfectly real, because it is performed in the flesh. But exactly for the same reason it remains inconceivable to the non-participants. Compare this with what Hegel wrote about the "mysti cism of concrete (= incarnate, D. Z.) reason": Speculative truth, it may also be noted, means very much the same as what, in special connection with religious experience and doctrines, used to be called Mysticism. The term Mysticism is at present used, as a rule, to designate what is mysterious and incomprehensible: and in proportion as their general culture and way of thinking vary, the epithet is applied by one class to denote the real and the true, by another to name everything connected with superstition and deception. Whereby we first of all note that there is mystery in the mystical, however, only for the understanding which is ruled by the principle of abstract identity; whereas the mystical, as synonymous with the speculative, is the concrete unity (Palamas' 'perihoresis', D. Z.) of those propositions which understanding only accepts in their separa tion and opposition. And if those who recognize Mysticism as the highest truth are content to leave it in its original utter mystery, their conduct only proves that for them, too, as well as for their antagonists, thinking means abstract identification... But, as we have seen, the abstract thinking of understanding is so far from being ultimate or stable, that it shows a perpetual tendency to work its own dissolution and swing round into its opposite. Reasonableness, on the contrary, just consists in embracing within itself its opposites as unsubstantial elements ('perihoresis' again, as the essence of'wise action', D. Z.). Thus the reason-world may be equally styled mystical - not however because thought cannot both reach and comprehend it, but merely because it lies beyond the compass of understanding.41</page><page sequence="64">404 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN This is exceptionally close to Palamas' basic point in philosophy of history. According to him, all interferences of God in the course of historical events, i.e., the 'events' themselves, are materializations of God in the 'reasonable ness' of the active holy people. The 'event of God' happens to somebody and results in his 'exemption', heroisation. Only in the records of such eventful happenings, rather than in records of battles, crownings, etc., is there something worth being recorded. What remains behind is the structure of history, marked with the 'deifications' of separate individuals, the symbols of themselves. God always remains hidden behind records and signs, and Man remains the Single Actor of History. Thus History is a product of actions of the 'people of the chosen', cooperating with one another and thus constituting the chain of the traceable Spirit. In fact, the same philosophy of history is found in Hegel and in Buddhist philosophy (Mahayana). To describe the state of the deified man, Palamas, following Maximus, refers to the mystical experience of the Apostle Paul (2 Cor. 12:2ff). The great Paul, after this extraordinary ecstasy, declares that he did not know what it was, Surely he saw himself. How? By the spirit that accomplished the ecstasy. But was he himself?.. . He was certainly that to which he had been united, that through which he knew himself, and that through which he left all things ... So Paul was Light and Spirit.42 In the same manner, Christ disappears in mystery for the outsider but still remains the Center and the One Whom the others will never know, but who is me, the knower: the Man, the Individual, the People, or the State - whatever reaches deification of its 'historical self. The chain of people who ranked in the Holy Tradition as the living carriers of the Testimony is what can be seen as constituting the victory over the 'negative theology'. These witnesses were positively raised as God-knowers and, insofar as God's mystery was upon each of them, every new practitioner could cooperate with them directly, i.e., call each of them by name, instead of Christ. This is how the Christocentric predicament is finally resolved or, rather, dynami cally displaced. What results is the continuity of history or, to use the homologous Marxist terminology, the natural (as related to Christ) - and - historical (as comprising the 'spiritual athletes') process of development of religious activity and culture. One can easily notice the difference between this process and the Catholic devotion to the Saints. The Orthodox 'polybeatificationism' (i.e., the chain of'deifications') is not a hidden</page><page sequence="65">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 405 polytheism, because plurality is exactly what is denied. In every new case of meeting with the Divine, the factuality of all previous meetings disappears as unreal. And it is exactly at this point that the pre-conception of 'personalism' sneaks in. If the unity is preserved in the totality, then, in the case of genuine 'sociation' ('perihoresis'), no singling out of reflective, self-conscious activity is possible. The only reality is the united, supra-personal Activity, creating the continuity of the multi-faceted and structured historical Substance. Once this Substance is composed of the genuine acts of cognition, it turns 'Sophiology' into a myth of unconditioned grace, enveloping the world and human minds with its deceptive mantle. To admit Sophiology is to put the sign of equation between God and the World of Nature.43 They are not equal but identifiable in parts by active self consciousness, in the substance of its concretely materialized thinking. Here again we must remember the Palamist 'bi-naturaP symbolism. Just like heat is the only way by which 'the consuming power of fire' appears in nature, so the God-knower makes God his activity. But fire, being a natural thing, simply cannot abide another quality (say, coolness); while God can be made of any attribute via the human deifying intention. It is not difficult to notice that this description is congenial with what Marx called the "mystery of, and the clue to, all Hegel's dialectics". The same schema can be presented in Hegel's terminology of 'self-conscious' Spirit, and then we can see how the ethics of the active sociating cognition could be materialized by the Hegelian-Marxist method of'ascent from the abstract to the concrete', so that Christocentrism became incorporated into it as an 'abstract' aspect of'concrete' State Power. In Hegel's Phenomenol ogy of Mind, we read: The essential spiritual being ( Wesen) of consciousness has been above designated as the ethical substance; spirit, however, is concrete ethical actuality ( Wirklichkeit). Spirit is the Self of the actual consciousness, to which spirit stands opposed, or rather which appears over against itself, as an objective actual world that has lost, however, all sense of strangeness for the self, just as the self has lost all sense of having a dependent or independent existence by itself, cut off and separated from that world. Being substance and universal self-identical permanent essence ( Wesen), spirit is the immovable irreducible basis and the starting point for the action of all and every one; it is their purpose and their goal, because the ideally implicit nature (Ansich) of all self-consciousnesses. This substance is likewise the universal product, wrought and created by the action of each and all, and constituting their unity and likeness and identity of meaning; for it is self-existence (Fiirsichseyn), the self, the action. Qua substance, spirit is unbending, righteous self-sameness, self-identity; but qua for-itself, self</page><page sequence="66">406 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN existent and self-determined (F?rsichseyn), its continuity is resolved into discrete elements; it is the self-sacrificing soul of goodness, the benevolent essential nature in which each fulfills his own special work, rends the continuum of the universal substance, and takes his own share of it. This resolution of the essence into individual forms is just the aspect of the separate action and the separate self of all the several individuals; it is the moving soul of the ethical substance, the resultant universal spiritual being. Just because this substance is a being resolved in the self, it is not a lifeless essence, but actual and alive.44 It is hardly possible to insist on a more complete philosophical coinci dence between Hegelian and Orthodox Christian thought. It is here that the reflection of the whole essence of the Orthodox ethics of meditative action is grounded. First directed toward the abstract, and therefore mysterious goal of the knowledge of God, it eventually resulted in the concreteness of the totalitarian State. Let us return for one more moment to the treatment of symbolism by Palamas. It is paradoxical, because the 'object' of cognition, i.e., God, intelligible in His symbolic manifestedness, is at the same time the subject of activity, who makes the object knowable naturally and materially (see the case of St. Paul above). Together they constitute the system of activity. It can be analysed in a specially constructed abstract model, by using this fictitious construction as a standard of comparison of the real activity of 'ascent'. Thus we obtain a method of unification of'one-sided', i.e., subjective characteristics of the static object (as mere 'object') into 'multiv alent' knowledge of this object (i.e., God as a simple'Essence'). Let us start with the perspective of'natural gnosis', i.e., with that of passive mysticism in conjunction with active voluntarism (because it happened to be the starting point of development of the Western mind). Let us assume that the object of cognition, i.e., God, appears in the form of an object of operation X (for example, when the experience is formulated by the means of expressive language), and that we apply to it a cognitive procedure D,, and by that means we single out an aspect A of the object X (say, the 'Omnipotence', 'Goodness' and similar 'ontological' characteris tics of God). Then we shall fix it in the significative form (A): 'Omnipo tence' is the natural quality of God, as heat is that of the 'consuming power of fire'. The product is knowledge represented in the following schema: X A (A)</page><page sequence="67">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 407 Then let the same object X (because God is one: T am who am') be approached in another cognitive operation D2, in a different moment of time and without any material connection with the previous cognitive procedure (in this way we satisfy the claim of false 'personalistic' conscious ness). As a result, another 'aspect', B, of the same object is singled out and represented in the significative form (B). Here we have another occur rence of knowledge: X D2 (B) Let us say that at this time we have the case of knowing God in His different attributes or simply via the other person, another God-knower just like the same tune played by different artists and on different instruments. But still we have got only ^positionaldifference, nothing more: the individuality of the knower remains unspecified. Analogously, we can single out as many 'aspects' C, D,... of the object as possible, and every time the correspond ing knowledge will be produced, and this knowledge will characterize the object from some particular vantage point. If, after performing the series of such procedures, we are asked, what this object X is, it can be presented by any of its characteristics from the set (A), (B),(Q, (D),... (i.e., not a single case of'personal' discovery of God should be excluded), or by combina tion: (A). (B), or (B). (Q. (D), etc., up to the combination of all characteristics discovered in the object X(ci. the problem of God's Names in Thomism or Vaishnavism). When comparing all these pieces of knowledge, we can call each of them multivalent if it comprises more characteristics than the rest from the same set, while this 'rest', on the contrary, should be considered as 'one-sided', in relation to the first. The main criterion of the 'one-sided/ multivalent' relation of knowledge is found in the dependency between the consecutive ly applied procedures Dlt D2, D3,etc, and their products, i.e., characteris tics (A), (B), (Q, etc. The essential condition here is that the nature of each subsequent procedure, and consequently its product, do not depend on the nature of the preceding procedure and its product (only the 'power' of total description matters). Therefore, if our task is to analyze and describe the single object, the order in which the procedures are applied and the order of organization of the discovered aspects into one multivalent knowledge, are</page><page sequence="68">408 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN of no significance. This step, in its essence, is what has been described above as the 'esthetizing' approach to God, in a series of disconnected judgments (that is why art does not have a history). When this kind of approach is introduced in the theory of cognition and science (which is called 'objectification'), it is mechanistically superim posed on different cognitive procedures, squeezed into the pre-given context. It should be remembered that this was precisely the main method ological shortcoming of Weber's method (discussed at the beginning of our study). He took the criterion of accumulation of a certain kind of valuative decision as an index of historical development. His problem, however, was that this criterion (i.e., the wealth of values) could indicate the growth of society only in aspects of the same kind (i.e., capitalism was attributed by its specific value of economic interest). In contrast to that, the main feature of the method of ascent from the abstract to the concrete is that every subsequent cognitive procedure depends on the nature and results of the preceding one. Thus the 're determined' feedback of each following procedure and its results to the previous ones is the way the active Hesychast 'cooperates' with his prede cessors. The first step of the ascent is outwardly to the first step of production of the one-sided component of'multivalent' knowledge: its result can be presented as a specification of 'aspectM in the object X, and a production of knowledge: X Dx (A) But this is only an apparent coincidence. The method of ascent is a great deal more complex construction than the previously discussed method of production of multivalent knowledge, because it also includes the level of speculative reflection of the whole sequence of procedures and the means of controlling each of them (the 'super-task' of knowing God, in the sense of final and positive attainment: see Hegel's definition of 'speculative mysti cism' above); so that procedures themselves must differ in their logical structure. The main distinction of this particular method is manifested in the path of transition from the first cognitive procedure and its product to the next one. This second procedure must be such that, by means thereof, it</page><page sequence="69">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 409 would be possible to single out in object X not just any arbitrary 'aspect' B, independent of the previously singled out 'aspect' A, but a quite particular and specific 'aspect' A B which, on the one hand, assimilates the initial 'aspect' A into itself and, on the other, comprises some properties and features not found in A. As a result, we have a new occurrence of knowledge about object X, namely of the following kind: A A).-^(AB) X \ A_ It should be accentuated that this new 'aspect' AB is not merely a sum of the 'aspects' A and B. It does not contain anything in addition to the 'aspect' A which could be singled out in the object Zby itself and independently of A. AB cannot be decomposed into A and B. Transition from (A) to (B) is not an 'essential' unification of A and B. In fact, this is a transition from the 'aspect' A to the 'aspectM?, and only on its basis we can accomplish the inverse transition from AB to A which, under definite conditions, can be treated as singling out, in the complex structure of the object X, a comparatively simple 'aspect' A, although in fact this A is not equal in its meaning to, and not identical in its function with that A which constitutes an organic part of the 'aspect' AB. Here we discover the principle of inequality of the 'aspect' A and ofthat residue which still remains in the 'aspect' A Baiter the 'mental extraction ' of A (provided that we take both of them in relation to the object X). The character (A) can be correlated with the object Zas its aspect, while the additive Z cannot be correlated by itself with X and does not appear as its 'aspect'; it is correlated with X only in the system of the 'aspect' AB and, consequently, only together with the transformed property A, in organic unity with it. Considering the first cognitional procedure and its result (the singled-out character (A)) in retrospect, i.e., from the point of view of the second cognitional procedure and its result (the character (AB), how can we assert that they are not arbitrarily selected or picked out by chance, to match the 'sublating' character (AB)1 Here the feedback of the first procedure appears in the process of ascent, received from the subsequent ones. The</page><page sequence="70">410 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN first procedure is for finding and singling out in the object A" the 'cell' or 'core' aspect A which, though existing surrounded by others and in organic connection with them, can nevertheless be presented as independent of them, i.e., as existent by itself. But, concurrently, it also appears as such; all the remaining characteristics of the object X depend on it and cannot be singled out and represented as 'aspects' of the object X, if they exist independently of the 'aspect' A. It is well known that, for example, Marx constructed his whole account of'capitalism' by singling out the 'core aspect' of value, in its relation to labour (the specified activity). In our case, we are trying to demonstrate that, in Eastern Christianity, the Cosmocracy of Christ happened to be the kind of'core aspect', crucial for the construc tion of the whole account of'Communism' as a system of Political State. It must be clear that the realistic specification and fixation of this 'aspect' in the historically complex object of Orthodoxy became possible only after development of the general preliminary idea of its manifestations (this was done in the preceding chapters of our study), which can be theoretically described and explained only when a relatively high level of empirical knowledge of the object is obtained, i.e., after accumulating enough historical evidence to support the original theoretical version. In our case, this obviously is the absolutization of secular political power. In other words, it is only now, when the Soviet system has emerged at the conclusion of the historical development of Russian society, that its sources in the Orthodox tradition can be discovered with all certainty. In Marxist phraseology, this is called 'overdetermination' - in the same sense that, according to Marx, the clue to the anatomy of ape is found in the anatomy of man. In our case, the point can be illustrated by the historical fate of the above-mentioned Judaizers. Could Ivan the Third lend his ear to their advice? Certainly. But then we would now have modern Russia as a kind of 'civil society', as both the logical consequence and the cumulative historical effect ofthat specific advice, and would have to turn elsewhere for an instance of both the logical and historical consequences of following a direction which was actually taken by Ivan the Third, resulting in 'political society'. Therefore, in the Russian case we meet what could happen (typologically) and what actually happened (historically). This 'realization of the type' (in contrast to Weber's 'ideal type') is what can be called 'overdetermination'. It is only from the summit of accumulated fact of today that we are able to select Ivan's decision as a historical fact of a</page><page sequence="71">ORTHODOX ETHICS ANDTHE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 411 special significance. In addition, we owe the very formulation of this possibility to the special methodology, with a distinct approach to the analysis of the accumulated empirical material. In the Soviet case, this means Marxism, is used in the double function of a concrete historical component of Soviet life and history (material implication), and a method of explanation (formal implication) which, by the way, does not mean at all that the Marxist theory is correct in the universal sense or that the author is a Marxist: both to the contrary. The choice is determined by its double correspondence to the material of study (now it seems clear that this is exactly what Weber missed in order to make his methodology complete). A meaningful empirical verification of the characteristics lifted from object X in the course of'ascent' is possible only after we have reached relatively concrete 'aspects' of the object, i.e., when the procedure of ascent itself is developed enough. Only in this case will the practical coincidence of the final contributions of the object with the empirical facts justify all the previously noted 'abstract' characteristics (for example, the 'Christocen trism' o? personal religiosity, leading to the 'Cosmocratic' sentiments and the eventual 'etatism' (derzavnosf)) of the Soviet people, as was shown above - in the same material line of development), on the basis of which the resultant presentations are produced and will serve as proof of their objective truth. Such is the theory. Now we shall process it briefly through the material. Two aspects of 'ascent' from religious (as 'abstract') to secular (as 'concrete') human existence and activity which attract here our utmost attention are, of course, authority and power. The concrete attitude of the Hesychast monk to the temporal power always corresponded to the rule of the Gospel: 'Give Caesar what belongs to Caesar'. But this attitude could not remain external and formal, in view of the mystical role of the Christian sovereign who was not just a Caesar but the protector of Christendom, to the last moment when 'all the time and terms will expire'. Int?riorisation of this attitude can be seen first of all in the relations of property between the Church and the State. Expansion and indivisibility of'Caesar's posses sions' were considered as indispensable prerequisites of consolidation of temporal power, so important for the survival of Christendom. That is why, in the cases of conflict concerning land-tenure by monasteries, the Hesychast Fathers were always against that land-tenure: not because they preferred mendicancy as more meritorious (as in the Catholic Franciscan</page><page sequence="72">412 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN Order), but simply because all the property was supposed to belong to the ' Appropriator of Power'. Thus the Byzantine Hesychasts readily admitted sequestration of ecclesiastical property by the secular power. In the case of insistent objections, the typical answer was as folllows: The Patriarch and the bishops are not the owners, but only the guardians of the property belonging to the Church, and as a result they have no right to alienate it. But if the sacred Emperor desires to take the villages on his own authority, let him do what he wishes, for it was he who gave them to the Church, and if he himself desires to take them, let him do so; he has the authority to act in this desire as he wishes.45 No active pursuit of the economic interest can be noticed, and the primacy of secular power (sacred as it was) in economic matters was always acknowledged. Even expropriation of all ecclesiastical property would hardly arouse much resistance. It is very symptomatic that the motivations of Soviet propaganda in expropriating Church property in 1921-1922 (to help the starving population of the Volga basin) were in the same vein of appeal to the 'sacred duty' of the Church to give away its property, at the disposal of the State. And this appeal was approved by the so-called Renovated Church... In the Hesychast monasteries, it was customary for monks to work with their own hands, in small cooperative associations. The same organization of labour was typical for the Zen Buddhist monasteries in China and Japan, and this is considered by some sociologists as an example of the origination of'Protestant-like' economic attitudes in the non-Western societies. But these monastic 'cooperatives' were mainly adaptive in their functions. The work was done for the sake of keeping the body healthy and clean, i.e., always ready for prayer. It is well known, however, that this kind of organization of labour influenced Russia (through the monastic rule introduced by Cyprian of Kiev). It was accepted by most Russian monas teries and later was reproduced in the artel organization, typical for Russian craftsmen. Thus, monasteries in Russia happened to be not only the breeding-ground of culture but also the first non-agricultural organiza tion of labour. This subject deserves much more detailed investigation, of course. It seems quite probable that exactly through such artels some aspects of the Hesychast outlook spread overall Russia. More important are its secularizing political tendencies; in fact, the artel organization of labour undermined the traditional peasant commune, centuries before the</page><page sequence="73">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 413 development of capitalism and the abolition of serfdom. The fabulous Russian 'commune' is, of course, a 'pet subject' of all defenders of the 'Russian way to socialism' (the Populists, etc.), as well as of some modern preachers of the 'old ways' (Solzhenitsyn). All the more amazing is that the following circumstance was never properly considered: in the winter time, a considerable part of the male population of all Russian villages traveled around the country in artels. Thus they would have, alternatively, the consciousness of the communal peasants and serfs of the local landlord, or that of the 'all-State' people (sometimes they did not come back and founded free Cossack settlements). Weber once aptly characterized Christianity as the 'religion of itinerant craftsmen'. The same description matches with our case, too, though it was a different Christianity and different craftsmen. Their religious, predominantly Hesychastic, attitudes were reflected in the famous book of 'crazy wayfarers', The Love of Goodness (dobrotoljubie). Now, we cannot go deeper into detail here, but it seems quite probable that this 'artel consciousness' (not exactly the peasants', not exactly the workers') was the source of the social conscious ness of the kind of people who came to power in Russia a few years after the Revolution and are well known under the misleading term of the 'new class' (coined by M. Djilas). These 'neither peasants nor workers' (later known as 'lower middle class': mes?ane, fig. 'Philistines') contributed mainly to the composition of the above-described 'anti-structure'. Their typical features included distinct anti-cultural sentiments combined with maximalist religious aspirations. Not having strong personal relations with their families (because they were frequent 'absentees') or their landlords, they had instead a most strong instinct of'collective guarantee' (krugovaja poruka), multiplied by respect for and fear of the national official adminis tration, their main adversary. This kind of people were, both socially and in terms of consciousness, protogenitors of the modern Soviet 'loutocracy'(to wit, a slight change of'autocracy'; even more aptly in Russian: 'xamoder zavie\ instead oVsamodefzavi?\ autocracy). In any case, now we can indicate that this 'artel labour' contributed more to dissipation and sporadic appearance, rather than to concentration of economic interests, and was very conducive instead to popularization of certain political and ethnic sentiments. All these features in relation to the property of authority and power are, of course, quite typical for all instances of the so-called 'Asiatic despotism'.</page><page sequence="74">414 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN But nowhere else than in Byzantium, and later in Russia, was the display of economic interest manifested so explicitly as a symbol (or 'aspect') of political power, rather than the political dominance working as an instru ment of the economy. In India, for example, the functions of imperial power consisted mainly in its duty of protecting the authority of the Brahmins, because accession to the throne had in turn to be sanctified by the Brahmanic ceremonies. All religious movements deriving from Brahman ism were considered inept for this purpose; therefore, even while not recognizing the direct authority of the Brahmins in matters of faith, all the heterodox subjects of the Hindu king had somehow to consider their orthodox authority, because it was delegated by the imperial power. Thus the authority of the Brahmins could never lose its efficacy. In this sense, the secular power in India always remained an 'aspect' or 'side' of the Brahmanic authority. For those who refused to recognize the sacred authority, it was simply impossible to survive in Hindu society, let them even preach the idea of'cosmocracy' in the literal sense. This is exactly what happened with Buddhism. Being a 'world religion', .Buddhism incorporat ed the symbol of'Cosmocrat' (Cakravartin) - originally the 'sacred king' - but still had to give up. Insofar as the religious authority in India took the secular power into itself as an attribute, the Hindu caste society developed as the direct antipode of the Russian one, and its historical development can be considered a case of'progressive sacralization' (i.e., it was more secular in antiquity but became more religious in modern times). No less typical for India was 'atomization' of religious performance. Exactly because all forms of organized protection of the Brahmanic institutions were provided by the State and society at large, there was no need for a Brahmanic Church. In Byzantium, the essential religiosity was also concentrated in individuals, but in this case it was very conducive to adaptation of the religious organization (i.e., the Church) to the needs of the State. That was particularly important in the situation of the pressing and permanent threat to the Empire's integrity from the barbarians. Organized religion was actually transformed into an agency of the Depart ment of State and used for purely political purposes. In this way, indirectly and passively, by leaving more 'living space' and spare human activity at the State's disposal, Orthodoxy furthered expansion of secular power. But its role was not just that of the 'passive noninterference'. By the time of approval of Hesychast practice and philosophy as cardinal for Ort ho</page><page sequence="75">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATT ER O F COMMUNISM 415 doxy, Byzantine society acquired some features of a self-reproducing system, a kind oVperpetuum mobile', with its constructive advantages appearing more distinctly in critical situations, when integrity of the whole was in danger. This is strikingly similar to the present condition of Soviet society. The corresponding Byzantine construction can be described as follows. The sphere of religious matter was made compressible to the 'atomic' state, thus leaving more chances for political manipulation with the formal organization of religion (the propagation of Christianity was regularly used as a sure method of protection against the barbarians). Inside of this sphere, Christocentrism was preserved intact; that is, it never lost its essential nature, so that the system was still able to reproduce itself even in regard to spiritual values. But, insofar as the only 'actual' value in Hesychasm was identified as a positive and continuous inner activity of the body (the 'inner, mystical freedom'), nothing else could be given a guaran teed protection of sacred authority (and not left at the disposal of the secular power), including the existence of the Church organization as such (the Emperor nominated the Patriarch, and it was quite simple for Peter the Great to abolish the Patriarchy and transform the Church into a State office). As a result, not a single manifested, i.e., 'non-mystical', value could be accepted as a genuine value. It was never rejected in its totality, but always 'humiliated' and put in dependence on State interests. In Byzantium, and later in Russia, it always happened that any claim of self-validity, to say nothing of priority, of other values save the ultimate one (such as economic interest, cultural activity, art, human rights, and human personality itself), was brought under State supervision and could be tolerated only when transformed into its office or function. In the same way, the State also preserved the unconditional essentiality of Orthodoxy. Now it can be accepted without doubt that some powerful mechanisms of popular awareness were put into action to make this possible. It is also the case that there existed some active stimulations of secular, politically coloured activity, with the main purpose of preserving the idea of 'cosmocracy'. But this ?tatisme always retained a special meaning; it was not just totalitarian ism for its own sake. Every member ofthat society was to live with the thought that 'everything is permissible', not because there is no God, but, on the contrary, because the real Christ cannot be destroyed or abused in</page><page sequence="76">416 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN any way. Therefore, 'no limits for repentance'. Sometimes it was even considered advisable to push one's neighbour gently toward repentance or to quicken his coming to the penitential mood by various 'attendant circumstances'. Not in the admonitions of the Soviet secret police, or in the 'philosophemes' of I van the Terrible (who claimed the salvation of souls of his subjects to be also in his jurisdiction), but in the writings of the greatest of all Eastern Christian theologians, Symeon, this passage is found: It is too bad, of course, to spy on somebody and to listen in on what your neighbour is saying or doing: but this is only when all that is done with bad purpose: to abuse him, or to disgrace and defame everywhere by divulging what you have seen or heard. But if the same is done with the good purpose, to correct the sins of your neughbour, with love to him, prudence, and confidence that this is of your business... then it is not so bad.46 On the other hand, all other aspirations were considered corruptible, and therefore not real ('sins'), not important enough to preserve. That society could easily 'humiliate' personal values, but it kept intact its own cultural meaning. This meaning could not be doubted: for the simple reason that it was neither an 'idea', nor any symbolic 'invention', whatsoever. It was the material activity of certain individuals, the activity of their bodies, i.e., the most genuine material production consumed by the rest of society. It was not zero, not nothingness, but something believed to be concrete and, in the sum of its influence on the social system as a whole, equal to the absolute power. But, insofar as it was an 'invisible' activity, popular belief assumed it was going on 'somewhere', even without seeing the 'actors'. Thus in modern atheistic society, the idea of the 'God-bearing Russian people' is still very much alive. Byzantine society perished only when its political machine was crushed by the superior military force of an external enemy. But its 'genetic constitution' was successfully grafted to the stalk of the ascending Russian State, which inherited all its features of alertness outside and watchfulness inside toward whatever could endanger its political system. It also inherited xenophobia and the habit of humiliating all 'non-committed' values, for the sake of the 'royal cause of power' (delo gosudarstvo), together with the amazing feeling of the metaphysical reality of power. This grafting chronologically coincided with the beginning of the long, drawn-out 'Westernization' of Russia, and it certainly mobilized the defense mechan isms, once developed within an Empire, surroundedly by barbarians and</page><page sequence="77">ORTHODOX ETHICS AND THE MATTER OF COMMUNISM 417 both suspicious and contemptful of everything coming from the outside. As a result, unusually strong tensions were built up within Russian society, and eventually they caused the resentful rejection of many Western patterns of social life which were 'infected' by the spirit of change (including Tsardom, the official religion, culture, and, of course, the capitalist system of economy). The new social structure was mainly filled with people of low culture, sometimes even 'anti-culture', who followed the policy of'humilia tion' of all values from 'outer darkness', but were quite sympathetic to the archaic, pre-Western idea of'pantocracy'. It goes without saying that Marxism played its specific role of 'booster' in this revolutionary return to the old ways partly because of its ideology which is 'subliminally' similar to Hesychasm (as a kind of secular parallel). Thus, Soviet Communism was consolidated as a system matching the deepest drives of the people. That is why, on the one hand, never before in Russia have the external conditions for manifestation of the genuine spirit of Christianity been so favourable - even optimal - as in the Soviet Union today. After a period of fluctuation, a kind of'concordat' was concluded between the Church and the atheistic State. Perhaps, in these days of the universal decline of Christianity, it is better for the Church to be oppressed and thereby to stay alive. At least it makes the Church closer to the spirit of primitive Christianity and justifies our major thesis that faith is important only for the genuinely faithful Christians. On the other hand, the cunning spirit of history has arranged it so, that the Soviet political machine carries out the same protective functions in relation to Marxism, as the Byzantine State used to perform in relation to Orthodoxy. And perhaps the forecasts of success in both cases must be similar. Now it seems clear that the Marxist conception of social-historical development cannot be workable all over the world by itself, i.e., merely by the inner logic of'proletarian revolution'. But there remains the Marxoid Soviet State, a very concrete materialization of that conception. Once having incorporated Marxism, the Soviet State works as a mechanism of expansion of what had accelerated its maturation into political secularism. And in this age, when all the values of economic development and growing material well-being, of scientific progress and personal autonomy are endangered and doubted, the Soviet machine of'humiliation' of all values suspected of'non-authenticity', can work very effectively. Perhaps the 'imperial power' is more suitable for the Universal Spirit than free</page><page sequence="78">418 DAVID B. ZILBERMAN entrepreneurship' and 'private initiative'. It looks like the Soviet political system is able to provide the mechanism of control over excessively growing human needs, in the same vein of their 'non-authenticity'. Human abilities are limited, and the State requires everybody's cooperation, to the degree of his abilities. But human needs are limitless and insatiable. That is why the State has to constrain them, and thereby secures its virtually perpetual survival in this function. Now, Soviet society is entering a period of'eternal movement forward, remaining in the same place'. Perhaps what will appear next is a new ideology, explaining this movement exactly as the process of materialization of the Communist promise. So much about the Soviet type of political secularization. Brandeis University NOTES 1 Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of of Capitalism, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1930. 2 A.
