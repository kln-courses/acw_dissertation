<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ideas of Divine Rule in the Ancient East, by C. J. Gadd (The Schweich Lectures of the British Acad- emy, 1945). Pp. 101. London, 1948. $3.00. This little book is one of the more sober and lucid accounts of the religious ideas current in the ancient Near East to appear in recent years. Its author, C. J. Gadd, keeper of the Babylonian and Egyptian De- partments in the Britism Museum, is primarily a cuneiform scholar, one of the most careful and ex- perienced in the field. Over the past quarter century</page><page sequence="2">92 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 he has copied and studied hundreds of clay documents written in the Akkadian and Sumerian languages, and has translated and interpreted many of them. In the book under review, he presents some of his more general conclusions on Assyro-Babylonian religious thought patterns, and compares them with what is known of the various other peoples of the ancient Near East down to the time of Persian dominance. The result is a careful, thoughtful, and well-rounded syn- thesis, with a particularly refreshing tendency toward understatement. The book is a somewhat expanded version of three lectures delivered by Mr. Gadd in 1945 in the well- known series of Schweich Lectures on Biblical Archae- ology. The first, entitled "The God," begins with a discussion of the hierarchical character of the pantheon which pervades all the polytheistic peoples of an- tiquity, and then proceeds with an analysis of the ancient notions underlying the various stories involv- ing the creation of man, cultural heroes and the "legendary" age when gods and men intermingle freely. It continues with a comparative sketch of some of the more common techniques of divine communica- tion, such as clairvoyancy, divination, prophecy and dreams, and concludes with an analysis of divine apologetics and the dying god dilemma in the light of ancient mythopoeic thought. The second lecture, entitled "The King," begins with a brief sketch of the diverging ideas of the ancients concerning the origin of kingship; in Gadd's succinct words, kingship was conceived by them as having been either "assumed" (in Egypt), "bestowed" (in Mesopotamia), or "permitted" (in Israel) by the gods. It next takes up the different notions concerning the functions of the king as an intermediary between man and god, his religious obligations, his duties to his subjects, and continues with some brief comment on the ideas of the king's right of accession to the throne, his coronation and investiture, as well as on the vexing problem of his divinity. Following a most lucid and concise sketch of Babylonian divination in the service of the Government, particularly the extispicium-- Gadd has done considerable and valuable original research in this branch of cuneiform studies-, the lecture concludes with an interesting exposition of the presumed divergent purposes of the royal inscrip- tions in Egypt and Mesopotamia. The third and last lecture, entitled "The People," is devoted to the ancient's ideas with regard to the life of the plain citizen, the joys and sorrows of the ordinary mortal as opposed to god and king. It points out the human need which led to the adoption of domestic gods closer to the individual and his needs than the more remote deities of his pantheon. It continues with an analysis of the formal as opposed to the moral character of behaviour judgment, and in this connection, sketches in some detail the omen- literature current particularly in Babylonia. The book closes with a brief sketch of the Babylonian proverb and wisdom compositions, the type of literature which is most revealing for their moral and philosophical outlook upon life. As is obvious from the preceding outline, sketchy as it is, Gadd's little book is a valuable addition to the broader studies of the ancient Near East, and it is a privilege to recommend it warmly to the scholar and humanist. In conclusion the following brief, specific comment may prove of value: For the difficult Sumerian con- cept of me (cf. pp. 11-12, and note 7), see now also JCS 2, 47 ff. The problem of the mortality of the gods (cf. 31-32) is largely a matter of semantics and exists to no small extent for modern man as well. As far as the ancients are concerned, it is to be pointed out that no matter what the theologian or poet may say to the contrary, the mortality of the gods is constantly im- plicit in their anthropomorphic concepts. On p. 34 Gadd hints at the existence of a Sumerian "heroic age," cf. now my "Heroes of Sumer" (PAPS 90, 120-130) and "New Light on the Early History of the Ancient Near East" (AJA 52, [1948] 156-164); it is interesting to note that Gadd and I came upon the idea of a Mesopotamian "heroic age" quite inde- pendently. The communistic economy which Gadd and other scholars postulate for the early Sumerian city-states (cf. 37) may turn out to be by no means as widespread as the extant administrative records- these come by and large from temple precincts- seem to indicate. In Fara, for instance, where private houses were excavated, we find buying and selling of real estate as early as the middle of the third millen- nium B.C. In Lagash, to judge from the still obscure Enbegal-tablet (PBS 9 No. 2), which dates from about the middle of the third millennium, even the king had to buy and pay for land he wished to acquire. This is further corroborated by the well-known Uru- kagina reform text (cf. SAK 46 ff.), which seems to know of private ownership of land and real estate. Gadd's statement on p. 40 that the title of sanga was reserved for the king from the time of Entemena (about 2400 B.C.) seems. incorrect, cf. now Schneider, JCS 1, 122-142. Similarly, the suggestion there made that the Elamite sukkals were apostles of the gods rather than representatives of earthly rulers is most unlikely. The existence of the notion of a social conscience in Mesopotamia (cf. 68) is indicated in no uncertain terms in a hymn to the goddess Nanshe composed probably in the last quarter of the third millennium B.C.; the text, reconstructed from four- teen tablets and fragments, is now being prepared for publication by Jacobsen and the reviewer.
