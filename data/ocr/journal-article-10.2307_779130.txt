<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Avant-Garde and the "New Spirit": The Case of Ballet mecanique* MALCOLM TURVEY Embedded in the standard story or version of the European avant-garde of the 1910s and 1920s are two basic assumptions. The first is that, despite its sheer variety, its dispersal across many often conflicting and openly hostile groups, the avant-garde of this period was nevertheless a unified phenomenon. It was unified by what Matei Calinescu has called "a radical criticism of the past and a definite commitment to change and the values of the future,"I a commitment that the poet Guillaume Apollinaire identified contemporaneously as a "New Spirit which ... promises to modify the arts and the conduct of life from top to bottom in a universal joyousness."2 According to scholars such as Calinescu, while the avant-garde's commitment to change was shared with modernism in general, it was much more uncompromising and extreme in character: "The avant-garde is in every respect more radical than modernity. Less flexible and less tolerant of nuances, it is naturally more dogmatic. ... [It] borrows practically all its elements from the modern tradition but at the same time blows them up, exaggerates them...."3 And as Apollinaire's words suggest, the avant-garde's commitment to change was social as well as aesthetic. It consisted not only of the sweeping rejection of older aesthetic conventions and traditions, but also the desire to fundamentally alter "the conduct of life" itself. Indeed, in the Soviet context, Boris Gasparov has argued that this desire to transform "not merely the conventions of art and language ... but life as a whole" was so extreme that the avant-garde would not bow to any constraint-be it aesthetic traditions, conventions of language and social behavior, or natural laws as established by * Earlier versions of this paper were presented to audiences at the following institutions: the Communication Arts Department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; the University of Chicago; and Sarah Lawrence College.

Even the most fundamental conditions of biological existence, such as mortality, were not seen as insurmountable for the human spirit, once its creative power had been freed from the limitations of the previous century's "positivist" mentality.4 The standard version recognizes, of course, that avant-gardists disagreed vehemently about what needed to be transformed in society and how, a disagreement that reflected broader tensions in the West about the forces of change at work in modernity and how they should be evaluated-forces such as secularization, scientific and technological progress, the rise of mass entertainment, industrialization, urbanization, and so on. Some avant-gardists (Futurists, Constructivists, Productivists) for the most part evaluated these forces positively, and argued that society should be transformed by intensifying them. Others (Dadaists, the Surrealists) on the whole evaluated them negatively, and believed that society should be changed by subverting and rejecting them, and finding alternatives. But what they all shared, according to the standard version, was a commitment to revolutionary social transformation of some kind. And a corollary of this commitment to the "not yet" was the rejection by avant-gardists 4.

Rather than an imitator of "the conduct of life"-a "realist"-the European avant-gardist of the 1910s and 1920s was either a "constructionist," offering an "intimation of what can be," as Andr6 Breton put it,5 or literally attempting to participate in the construction of a new society on a practical level when conditions allowed, as the Soviet Productivists aimed to do; or a "destructionist," typified by the nihilist wing of Dada. The second assumption embedded in the standard version follows from the first, namely, that it was the avant-garde's uncompromising commitment to change-both aesthetic and social-that set it apart from other artistic trends and movements of the period, including the movements of the 1930s (such as Socialist Realism) that were to varying degrees enforced by the totalitarian governments of Italy, Germany, the USSR, and later France. Unlike the avant-garde, these rejected aesthetic change by perpetuating the older aesthetic conventions and traditions of realism and classicism. And again unlike the avant-garde, they were much more likely to reject social change by advancing "reactionary" political and ideological positions. Revisionist scholarship in art history on the avant-garde, however, has challenged these two assumptions in a number of ways. For example, careful empirical research by historians has revealed that the avant-garde's commitment to aesthetic change, and its aesthetic difference from the realism and classicism of other artistic trends and movements, was not nearly as extreme as the standard version assumes and the avant-garde's own rhetoric suggests. In the French context, for example, scholars such as Kenneth Silver and Christopher Green have shown how the French avant-garde was gripped by a so-called "call to order" after World War I, a "call to order" that manifested itself in a variety of self-conscious attempts by avant-gardists to ground their artistic practice in classical tradition.6 Others have attacked the second assumption I outline above, namely, that it was its uncompromising commitment to social transformation that set the avant-garde apart from other artistic trends and movements of the period. The work of Romy Golan on the post-World War I French avant-garde and its relationship to the "reactionary" pastoralism of French middlebrow art is a good example. Golan has argued that, far from being marginal political and ideological positions that became dominant only in the 1930s and under Vichy, pastoralist themes such as "the disenchantment with technology,... the turn to the rural and, in more general terms, to the organic became ever-more perva- sive in French art" of the 1920s. "Instead of the tabula rasa predicated by high modernism" (by which she means the commitment to the "not yet"), Golan argues that the 1920s were dominated by "a collective ethos driven toward the 5.

[O]rganic retrenchment deeply affected all of the major modernists working in France. By the late 1920s, even hard-liners like Fernand L6ger, Le Corbusier, and Amed6e Ozenfant would shift towards organicism, distancing themselves from the unconditional embrace ... of the machine aesthetic that had previously informed their work.7 In other words, as the 1920s progressed, according to Golan, French avant- gardists such as Leger, Ozenfant, and Le Corbusier compromised their commitment to the radical social changes envisaged by their "machine aesthetic" by incorporating "reactionary" political and ideological positions into their artistic practice from pastoralism and the cultural and political discourse around it- principally organicism and a "return to man." It is therefore not as easy as the standard version argues it is to distinguish French avant-garde art of the 1920s from other artistic trends and movements on the basis of its commitment to fundamental social transformation. Whether or not one agrees with the specific conclusions of these scholars, the general picture of the avant-garde that is emerging from this kind of revisionist scholarship in art history is of a much more ambivalent, contradictory, and complex phenomenon than the standard version and the avant-garde's own rhetoric-both of which suggest that the avant-garde's commitment to aesthetic and social change was extreme and uncompromising in character-acknowledges. As Hal Foster has put it: "avant-garde practice at its best is contradictory, mobile, and otherwise diabolical."8 Or asJohn Bowlt and Olga Matich have suggested, the avant-garde was a "multifarious phenomenon ... represent[ing] the most contrary philosophical positions: mechanis- tic and organic, mathematical and lyrical, primordial, classical, and modern."9 It is as a contribution to this type of revisionist view of the avant-garde, which has not emerged in film studies to the extent it has in art history, that I offer the following analysis of Fernand L6ger's film Ballet mecanique. Underlying this analysis is the suspicion that it was rarely the case that any European avant-garde artist's commitment to change was unequivocal in nature. For while it is undoubtedly true that aesthetic and social transformation was a major preoccupation of the 7.

Bowlt and Foster's pronouncements call to mind Benjamin Buchloh's critique of Peter Bfirger's book Theory of the Avant- Garde, a work that takes the avant-garde's stated desire for revolutionary aesthetic and social change at face value. As Buchloh puts it in his 1984 review of Buirger's book: "any theorization of avant-garde practice from 1915 to '25 ... must force the vast differences and contradictions of that practice into the unifying framework of theoretical categories, and is therefore doomed to failure. One wishes that Bilrger had displayed some awareness of how patently absurd it is to reduce the history of avant-garde practices in 20th century art to one overriding concern" (Art in America [November 1984], p. 19).</page><page sequence="5">The Avant-Garde and the "New Spirit" 39 European avant-garde of the 1910s and 1920s, that transformation nevertheless inspired in avant-garde artists, I suggest, fear as well as awe, anxiety as well as Apollinaire's '"joyousness"-and European avant-garde artistic practice was often just as much a highly imaginative "cure" or "antidote" for it as an embrace of it. This, at least, is what I hope to demonstrate in the case of Ballet mecanique, a film that is usually viewed as an art work overflowing with Apollinaire's "New Spirit."10 I The standard reading of L6ger's Ballet mecanique in both art history and cinema studies argues that the film is concerned with a distinct type of revolutionary social change in modernity that greatly preoccupied the avant-garde in the 1910s and 1920s. Society, it was argued by many avant-gardists of the period, was being fundamentally transformed by forces such as technology, industrialization, and urbanization, all of which were rapidly increasing the pace of everyday life for human beings, especially in urban environments. As a result of this increase, reality was no longer perceptually experienced by human beings as a smooth, spatiotemporal continuum, according to many avant-gardists. Rather, it was now perceptually experienced as a dynamic, fragmented, unstable flux, susceptible to constant rupture and violent transition. It is this, for the sake of shorthand, "dynamic" perceptual experience of reality that is, of course, the subject of much avant-garde art in a variety of media, especially prior to World War I. And it is considered by many Leger scholars to be the major subject of his idiosyncratic Cubist and post-Cubist painting style, often termed "dynamic divisionism," from about 1910 onward.11 His concern with it is said to have originated in his exposure, during his formative years as a painter in Paris, to the heady mixture of Futurism, Bergsonian philosophy, and the concept of "simultaneity" prevalent among the poetic avant-garde in the years 1911 through 1914--and in particular to his association and friendship with the poet Blaise Cendrars. And the claim that it is the major subject of his painting is supported by much of what L6ger had to say about his art during this period. The following quotation from 1913 is highly representative: "Present-day life, more fragmented and faster moving than life in previous eras, has had to accept as its means of expression an art of dynamic divisionism."12 10. T. J. Clark describes quite beautifully the complexity of the attitude toward social change I will try to point to in Ballet m&amp;canique "Modernism is caught interminably between horror and elation at the forces driving it" (Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999], p. 8). Clark does not, however, seem to share this attitude with the artists and art works he analyzes, instead viewing "modernization" as a "holocaust" (ibid., p. 3). Surely, even the most trenchant critic of modernity should have a more nuanced and balanced view than this. 11.

This reading originates in modern cinema studies in Standish Lawder's now classic work The Cubist Cinema, published in 1975, which argues that Ballet micanique is continuous with L6ger's painting as a whole in that it instantiates for the spectator this distinctively modern, dynamic perceptual experience. In order to substantiate this argument, Lawder and others typically argue that the dynamic perceptual experience of reality remains the major concern of L6ger's painting at least up until he makes Ballet micanique in 1923-24. Evidence for this claim is usually found in L6ger's famous painting from 1919, The City, which is commonly agreed to be a major work in the avant- garde painting genre of "visual simultanism"-by which is basically meant the synthesis of physically and psychologically disparate fragments into a single image as a pictorial equivalent of a dynamic but single perceptual experience. Here is how Lawder, echoing standard simultanist readings of the painting in art history, describes it: The City is essentially a portrait of modern life in which L6ger has used the Cubist visual vocabulary of sharp-edged flattened forms to create a simultaneous image of the many characteristic faces of the city. The constant shift of scale and viewpoint, the rush of images assaulting the eye simultaneously, the confusion of the senses, the disjointed space, the depersonalization of the individual, the vision in motion-all of these sensations that so incisively describe city life are realized by Leger here. The painting has a consciously modern note, for Leger was highly sensitive to the images and rhythms of urban life. He attempted to transpose those sensory impressions directly and immediately onto his canvas.13 Although Ballet mecanique is obviously not a city film, Lawder argues that it attempts to elicit the same dynamic perceptual experience from the specta- tor as The City. As he puts it, "Contrast is both the life blood and the binding force of Ballet micanique. The film is composed not from separate shots, which link to each other as in most films, but from disparate ones which clash and collide."I4 And he links the putative centrality of perceptual dynamism in the film created through editing to the concerns and strategies of L6ger's painting as a whole: He sought to create in film the same discontinuous, fragmented, kalei- doscopic world that his paintings [describe].... The pulsating energies of modern urban life, its rhythms and its forms .. . all can be felt in Ballet micanique. [This] film is a spectacle in constant movement..,. a 13. Standish D.

Cendrars's book on the cinema, L'ABC du cinema, published in 1918, is seen as a direct influence both on Leger's painting and on Ballet mecanique. In this book, Cendrars focuses on those cinematic techniques that seem to parallel most closely the simultanism of his poetry: editing and the close-up. He celebrates in particular the capacity of these techniques to fragment space and time, and-especially through rapid editing-to produce an overwhelming and exhilarating visual experience of dynamism. As he puts it, "A hundred worlds, a thousand movements, a million dramas simultaneously enter the range of the eye 15. Ibid., p. 167. ............... .. .... ..... . . . . . . . .

And from this aesthetic debt to Cendrars, it is a short leap to the claim that Ballet mecanique, under the influence of Cendrars's basically simultanist conception of the cinema, also uses editing and the close-up to fragment objects and disruptively and rapidly cut from shot to shot, creating an effect of perceptual dynamism for the spectator. Finally, several statements from LUger's writings of the period, both on his film and his art in general, are marshaled to support this reading. In 1924, for example, during the period in which he was completing Ballet mkcanique, Lager writes in an article for his dealer Leonce Rosenberg's magazine, The Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne: Life rolls by at such a speed that everything becomes mobile. The rhythm is so dynamic that a "slice of life" seen from a caf6 terrace is a spectacle. The most diverse elements collide and jostle one another there. The interplay of contrasts is so violent that there is always exaggeration in the effect you glimpse.17 And, as Lawder is keen to point out, in his unpublished preparatory notes for Ballet mecanique, L6ger summarized the design of his film as follows: "Everything is a constant opposition of violent contrasts."18 Thus, we have the standard reading of the film, which argues that it is concerned with a distinct type of radical social transformation in modernity: the putative change in human perceptual experience of reality brought about by the increased pace of life attendant upon technological progress, industrialization, and other forces of modernization. Ballet mecanique, it is argued, instantiates this specifically modern perceptual experience of reality, one of conflict, fragmentation, and dynamism. And this reading, originating in Lawder's work, is still very influential. For example, it is repeated almost verbatim in a catalogue essay from 1994 by Dorothy Kosinski.19 There is, however, another plausible reading of the film's concern with revolutionary social transformation, one which, to my knowledge, has never been systematically articulated, but which is nevertheless present in Lawder's 16.

It concerns the film's relation to the "machine aesthetic" or "machinism" of the 1920s, associated mainly with Le Corbusier and Ozenfant in France, but also found elsewhere among the avant-garde in Europe, particularly in the Soviet Union. Summarizing somewhat crudely and reductively: According to machinism, society should be fundamentally transformed using the machine as a blueprint, so as to produce a utopia of order, harmony, control, and maximum efficiency. Through the literal and figurative mechanization of life, a new, utopian society should be created. And it is this radical transformation of society through the mechanization of life, based on an idealized conception of the machine typical of the 1920s, that Ballet micanique can plausibly be seen as concerned with. Most obviously, the film itself contains shots of machines and machine parts, mass-produced objects manufactured by machines, and an intermittent mechanical rhythm created by editing as well as movement within the image, which periodically animates the subjects of the shots with a mechanical beat regardless of whether they are machines or not. This rhythm also functions- along with plastic properties such as shape and texture-to encourage the spectator to notice abstract similarities between the mechanical and nonmechanical objects the shots depict. The apparent centrality of the machine in the film also dovetails with Leger's postwar painting in general. Although he had used mechanical shapes such as cylinders as plastic elements prior to the war in paintings such as La femme dans un fauteuil (1913)-therefore famously breaking with the Cubists' standard use of traditional subjects such as the nude-it is only after the war that machines and machine parts actually become concrete subjects of his paintings. And this change is commonly attributed to LUger's experiences as a soldier on the front line during the war. Thus, Ballet mecanique can be tied in a loose way to machinism because of the seeming centrality of the machine in it, as well as the centrality of the machine in the paintings preceding it. However, it can also be tied to the machine aesthetic in a more precise way. For although the film does not explicitly or systematically offer the machine as a blueprint for transforming society, it nevertheless does make a more substantial gesture toward one component of the transformation of society envisaged by machinism, namely, the mechanization of human beings. And it does this in a variety of ways: through the rhythmical repetition of the facial expressions of Kiki de Montparnasse, which robs her face of psychological depth and turns it into a pure plastic surface; through the use of an aperture to isolate her facial features, which has a similar effect; through the use of editing to rhythmically repeat bodily movement, as in the famous sequence of the washerwoman climbing a staircase, which again robs the human body of psychological depth and turns it into a plastic object animated by a mechanical beat; and through the general emphasis throughout the film on abstract similarities between mechanical objects and the human face and body, such as similarities of shape and rhythm.</page><page sequence="10">NM' " i?

And Leger was no exception, remarking, for example, in a letter to his dealer Rosenberg in 1922, "The contemporary environment is clearly (dominated by) the manufactured and 'mechanical' object; this is slowly subjugating the breasts and curves of woman, fruit, the soft landscape."20 While such remarks by LUger are quite rare, it is certainly plausible to argue that this view of "the contemporary environment" and its transformative impact on the human body is instantiated in his postwar nudes and human subjects, which are highly mechanized and standardized in character, and which lack any kind of psychological dimension. Whether or not we take Leger to be subscribing to the neo-Lamarckian view that human beings will literally evolve into machine-like entities in modernity, it is clear that the human face and body in Ballet mecanique are reduced to plastic objects, and that the spectator is strongly encouraged by the film to notice abstract similarities between them and machines. And this seems to indicate the presence in the film of a distinctly machinist version of the avant-garde commitment to transforming society, especially that component of machinism that views the machine as a blueprint for the transformation of human beings themselves. Further evidence for this can be found in L6ger's writings on film from this period. In his essay from 1922 on Gance's La Roue, for example, he points approvingly to the way in which, in the first part of the film, "the machine becomes the leading character, the leading actor," and that this elevation of the machine "crushes and eliminates the human object, reduces its interest, pulverizes it."21 And this clearly echoes the views of other artists and filmmakers allied to the machine aesthetic, including Dziga Vertov, who in exactly the same year-1922- is calling for the "[exclusion of] man as a subject for film" and his replacement by "the poetry of machines." "The machine makes us ashamed of man's inability to control himself," announces Vertov, articulating the contempt for the human body typical of the machine aesthetic in its heroic phase.22 Thus, we have a second plausible reading of the film's concern with social change. Again, this reading can be found in Lawder's seminal work, where he talks of the mechanization of the human figure in the film.23s And there are also traces of it in the detailed analysis of the film by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson 20.

As they put it: [T] he film creates a mechanical dance. Relatively few of the many objects we see in the film are actually machines.... But through juxtaposition with machines and through visual and temporal rhythms, we are cued to see even a woman's moving eyes and mouth as being like machine parts.24 On the aesthetic level, there is a major, fundamental incompatibility between this reading and the first. For Bordwell and Thompson's reading argues that the film is designed to encourage the spectator to notice abstract similarities between shots, rather than to produce the "violent contrasts" between shots that the first reading postulates as the central perceptual effect of the film. Without a doubt, both of these readings correctly identify a concern in Ballet mecanique with two distinct types of social change: the putative radical transformation in human perceptual experience supposedly brought about by the increased pace of life in modernity, and the significance of the "machine age" for society. But neither reading tells the full story. For what neither addresses is the nature of this concern, the attitude of the film toward these social changes. If one looks carefully, one finds that this attitude is not the extreme and uncompromising one postulated by the standard version of the avant-garde, but is instead much more complex. This complexity becomes visible if we try to resolve the aesthetic incompatibility between the two readings I have summarized above, as well as consider several types of new evidence: a) other comments that LUger made about his film and the cinema as a medium; b) other aspects of the film's design; c) what Leger was saying about his art in general around 1923-24 when the film was made; d) research on the post-World War I "call to order" among the French avant-garde published since Lawder wrote his seminal and highly influential book; and e) Leger's debt to French film theory of the early 1920s beyond Cendrars, which is very rarely remarked on by interpreters.25 24. David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, Film Art (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1997), p. 148. 25. There is a third reading of the film, recently formalized by William Moritz, which views the film as Dadaist ("Americans in Paris: Man Ray and Dudley Murphy," in Lovers of Cinema: The First American Film Avant-Garde 1919-1945, ed. Jan-Christopher Horak [Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995]). Moritz argues that Ballet micanique's "primary filmmakers" were the Americans Dudley Murphy and Man Ray, not L6ger, and that L6ger erroneously claimed credit for the film (pp. 119; 126). According to Moritz, in the majority of the film's footage, which "originated with Man Ray and Murphy, an ironic spirit pokes Dada fun at the seriousness of Machine Modernism, at Purist and Futurist utopianism.... L6ger loved machines; Ballet micanique does not" (pp. 128-29). I do not address this reading here, for it seems highly implausible to me. While it may be the case that Murphy and Ray had a greater role in the conception of the finished film (as opposed to filming some of its parts) than has hitherto been acknowledged, and that the film bears traces of their influence, there is a far greater continuity-in terms of form and iconography-between L6ger's art in general and the versions of the film that survive than there is in the cases of Murphy or Ray, a continuity that bears out the claim for</page><page sequence="13">The Avant-Garde and the "New Spirit" 47 II Let us take the machinist reading first. This reading argues that the machine is central to Ballet mecanique in the literal form of shots of machines and machine parts, and in the more figurative form of the mechanical beat that periodically animates mechanical and nonmechanical objects alike, as well as the abstract similarities between machines and nonmechanical objects-such as the human face and body-which the film foregrounds. However, if we look closely at L6ger's writings from around 1923-24, we find that, although the machine is obviously a central preoccupation for him, Leger describes it simply as "raw material" that he uses in the creation of something else that is much more important. As he puts it in 1923, "The mechanical element is only a means and not an end. I consider it simply plastic 'raw material,' like the elements of a landscape or a still life."26 The machine is a means to an end for the creation of something else in his art, according to L6ger. It is not an end in itself. And during this period, the something else that Leger aims to create in his art is what he refers to most often as "the Beautiful" or, quite simply, "Beauty." The production of beauty is the central ambition of his art at this time, he repeatedly asserts, and one place where he believes that beauty occurs often, but certainly not always, is in what he refers to as "modern" or "useful" objects, which include, but are not confined to, machines and mass-produced objects. He therefore states that the goal of his painting is to "obtain the equivalent of the 'beautiful object' sometimes produced by modern industry."27 Indeed, he views artists within modernity as being in competition with, and potentially rendered obsolete by, the beauty of the "modern" or "useful" object: The situation at the present moment is tragic enough. The artist is "in competition" with the useful object, which is sometimes beautiful. Or at least fascinating. He [the artist] must create as well or better.... If they were always beautiful, there would no longer be any reason for the Leger's primary authorship. For example, there is the repeated use of close-up, the cinematic technique most prized by Leger; the depersonalization of the human face and body; the attempt to replicate the modern, dynamic perceptual experience of reality pointed to by Lawder; the systematic effort at drawing attention to graphic similarities between mechanical and non-mechanical objects pointed to by Bordwell and Thompson; and the film's iconography, drawn from Purism. All of these are Leger's concerns, amply documented in his painting and writing prior to and around the time of the making of the film. None of these are primary concerns in Murphy's prior output, or in Man Ray's Dada/Surrealist films of the 1920s. Furthermore, if looked at closely, Moritz's argument rests on little more than a few statements by Ray and Murphy themselves (why should one believe them any more than LUger?), and the highly impressionistic claim that the film pokes fun at machines, one that does not accord with my experience of the film. While the film certainly has an atmosphere ofjoyous celebration, it does not, to my eyes, poke fun at anything, except perhaps bourgeois taste, which had been a feature of LUger's art since he pioneered his style of "dynamic divisionism" from 1910 onward. 26.

I repeat, in the face of these objects, the artist's situation is often disturbing.28 Thus, for L6ger in 1923, the year he begins to make Ballet m'canique, the production of beauty is the major stated ambition of his art, and beauty is often found for him in "modern" or "useful" objects, including machines, with which the artist is in competition. Now, there is a great deal one can say about L6ger's concept of beauty, in part due to the imprecision with which he defines it, and in part due to its complex ori- gins and genesis. However, for the sake of brevity, I will point to only those features that are of relevance to the machinist reading of Ballet mecanique under discussion. First, L6ger during this period defines beauty both in reality and in his art in, roughly speaking, a classical fashion as "geometrical order," in which the plastic properties of objects are internally and externally balanced into harmonious, ordered relationships. As he puts it: A picture organized, orchestrated, like a musical score, has geometric necessities exactly the same as those of every objective human creation (commercial or industrial achievement). There are the weight of masses, the relationship of lines, the balance of colors. All the things that require an absolute order.29 And what is beautiful about many "modern" or "useful" objects, for which Leger's art tries to find a competitive "equivalent," is precisely their classical qualities, their order, balance, and harmony. The relationship of volumes, lines, and colors demands absolute orchestration and order. These values are all unquestionably influential; they have extended into modern objects such as airplanes, automobiles, farm machines, etc. Today we are in competition with the "beautiful object"; it is undeniable.30 Second, we can recognize in L6ger's embrace of a broadly classical ideal of beauty during this period the influence of the turn toward classicism by the French avant-garde in general in the post-World War I years, the so-called "call to order" that I mentioned earlier. While this "call to order" and embrace of classicism was a complex phenomenon that defies a simple summation, Christopher Green has concluded that its principle effect on Leger was that, from about 1920 onward, "Leger's view of what was essential to reality in modem life gave a central importance to the qualities of precision, economy, and equilibrium."31 And it is these classical qualities that scholars such as Green see as being instantiated in the balance of hori- 28.

Third, in line with classical conceptions of beauty more generally, L6ger argues that the beauty he is trying to produce in his art is not specific to modernity, but is a universal, transhistorical, human constant. Again in 1924, he says, We are not now confronting the phenomenon of a new order, properly speaking; it is simply one architectural manifestation like others.... Greek art made horizontal lines dominant. It influenced the entire French seventeenth century. Romanesque art emphasized vertical lines.... One can assert this: a machine or machine-made object can be beautiful when the relationship of lines describing its volumes is balanced in an order equivalent to that of earlier architectures.32 In other words, what is beautiful for Leger about "modern" or "useful" objects-a beauty he attempted to instantiate in his art-is fundamentally continuous with beauty in previous epochs. We should not conclude from this that he did not think there was something significantly different about modernity from previous epochs, for he argues repeatedly that "modern man lives more and more in a predominantly geometric order."ss However, he did not see this "geometric order" itself as anything radically new-merely its intensity and omnipresence was new. Fourth, while this broadly classical ideal of beauty is often embodied for L6ger in the machine, it also transcends the machine to include a variety of 32. Leger, "The Machine Aesthetic: The Manufactured Object, the Artisan, and the Artist" (1924), in Functions of Painting, p. 53. 33. Ibid., p. 52.</page><page sequence="16">50 OCTOBER objects in everyday life that exemplify it. As L6ger puts it in 1924, "The Beautiful is everywhere; perhaps more in the arrangement of your saucepans in the white walls of your kitchen than in your eighteenth-century living room or in the official museums."34 And he is very careful to insist, again in 1924, that beauty and the machine are by no means co-extensive: [T]he more the car has fulfilled its functional ends, the more beautiful it has become. That is, in the beginning, when vertical lines dominated its form ... the automobile was ugly.... When, because of the necessity for speed, the car was lowered and elongated ... it [became] beautiful. This evidence of the relationship between the beauty and utility of the car does not mean that perfect utility automatically leads to perfect beauty; I deny it until there is a conclusive demonstration to the contrary.35 Thus, it seems clear that L6ger's primary artistic ambition at the time he made Ballet mecanique was to produce beauty, using the machine as one type of "raw material"; that his conception of beauty was, broadly speaking, a classical one; and that beauty and the machine were overlapping, but separate, concepts in his theory and painting. And there is ample evidence to support the argument that L6ger extended all of this into his film practice. First, if we look carefully at what L6ger liked so much about La Roue-and, if you recall, it is his remarks about La Roue that can be used to support the machinist reading that argues for the centrality of the machine in Ballet mecanique-it is not the centrality of the machine per se that he celebrates, but its instantiation of a classical ideal of beauty: You will see [in La Roue] moving images presented like a picture, centered on the screen with a judicious range in the balance of still and moving parts (the contrast of effects); a still figure on a machine that is moving, a modulated hand in contrast to a geometric mass, circular forms, abstract forms, the interplay of curves and straight lines (contrasts of lines), dazzling, wonderful, a moving geometry that astonishes you. [My emphasis.]36 Second, Ballet micanique depicts many "modern" and "useful" objects, of which only some are machines or machine parts. It also depicts hats, bottles, kitchen utensils, words, abstract shapes such as circles, and much else. While most of these objects are not machines, arguably what nearly all of them have in common are classical qualities: their shapes are highly geometrical and symmetrical; they are often organized into ordered, balanced patterns, and so on. Third, it is possible to interpret the way in which the film consistently foregrounds the abstract similarities between these objects not as an attempt to 34. Ibid., pp. 52-53. 35.

Evidence for this emerges if we address L6ger's initially perplexing claim about his film that it is, in effect, not an abstract film at all. Scholars such as Bordwell and Thomspon view the film as a paradigmatic example of an abstract film, and they employ it as such in their Film Art textbook by examining in detail the various ways it encourages the spectator to notice abstract similarities between objects in different shots. And yet, Leger emphatically stated about his film, "Figures, fragments of figures, mechanical fragments, metals, manufactured objects ... objective, realist, and in no way abstract."37 What are we to make of this statement? In part, as Kristin Thompson has pointed out to me, it is probably the case that L6ger simply meant that his film is not "abstract" in the sense that, say, Hans Richter and Victor Eggeling's films are abstract. In other words, unlike their films, or the paintings of a Kandinsky or a Mondrian, Ballet micanique is not concerned with the Neoplatonic depiction of spiritual or metaphysical truths behind appearances.38 However, there is a second sense in which the film can be understood as "in no way abstract" that is hinted at in the manner in which the quotation above lists some of the concrete objects depicted in Ballet mecanique, as opposed to their abstract similarities to each other. One of the things that readers of L6ger might notice in his remarks on film in general is the extent to which, above all other cinematic techniques (including editing, which he hardly ever mentions), L6ger privileged and emphasized the close-up and its transformative power. For example, in his retrospective notes on Ballet micanique, he remarked, "I used the close-up, which is the only cinemato- graphic invention."39 And in his March 1923 reply to Ren6 Clair's enquite in the journal Film, he observed, "[The cinema] will be everything.., .when filmmakers develop the consequences of the close-up, which is the cinematic architecture of the future."40 By themselves, neither of these quotations should surprise us too much, for as we know from Lawder's research, L6ger was indebted to Cendrars's book L'ABD du cinema, in which the close-up, along with editing, is singled out repeatedly. However, following the passage just quoted from Film, L6ger goes on to say of the power of the close-up, "A detail of an object transformed into an absolute whole is personified when projected in large dimensions; a portion of a human being is personified when projected in large dimensions."41 And in his remarks on Ballet 37.

Epstein, by 1923, was an acquaintance of L6ger's, and had published a text by L6ger in his journal Promenoir in Lyons. L6ger knew Epstein's works Bonjour Cinema and La podsie d'aujourd'hui, and in March 1923 named him, along with Gance and Cendrars, as one of the most important figures in the French cinema. Epstein's basic, and frankly mystical, argument about the close-up in the early 1920s was that it, along with movement, endowed objects with a "personality," a "soul," a "life," thereby dramatically intensifying the perceptual and emotional impact they have on the spectator. And it is this argument to which L6ger was probably alluding, I believe, in the remarks I have cited. It is impossible to know how far L6ger subscribed to Epstein's theory, or indeed how much he understood it, for he does not spell out his use of the word "personality." However, I think it is a plausible conjecture that he believed, following Epstein and other early French film theorists who held similar views, that by using the close-up in Ballet mecanique and by endowing the objects he depicted in each shot with movement, he would thereby grant these objects an anthropomorphic "personality." For not only does Ballet mecanique encourage the spectator to notice abstract similarities between objects, it also makes extensive use of the close-up- indeed, almost every shot is a close-up. And, of course, almost every object depicted in the film is endowed with movement of some kind. This debt to Epstein's film theory suggests that L6ger was not merely concerned with drawing the spectator's attention to the abstract similarities between objects. Rather, the consistent use in the film of the close-up and movement suggests that-under the influence of Epstein's theory of the power of these techniques-he was equally concerned with intensifying the perceptual and emotional impact on the spectator of the concrete objects themselves, independently of their abstract similarities to each other. And, of course, many of the objects in the film are not machines. My guess is that L6ger wanted to interest the spectator in all of these concrete objects-and not just machines or their abstract similarities to each other-because, as I have already suggested, during this period his primary goal was the production of a classical ideal of beauty. While he certainly believed that most machines instantiated this ideal, he also thought that many other objects, such as hats, bottles, and indeed the human face, did so as well. By endowing these objects with movement and shooting them in close-up in Ballet micanique, L6ger followed Epstein in assuming, I think, that they would gain an anthropomorphic personality, thereby intensifying the perceptual and emotional 42. LUger, "Ballet Micanique" (ca. 1924), p. 50.</page><page sequence="20">54 OCTOBER impact on the spectator of the classical beauty he believed them all to possess. Whether or not the close-up in combination with movement actually achieves such an effect, their consistent use in the film seems to point to L6ger's concern to interest the spectator in a number of concrete objects, not just machines or abstract similarities.43 What can we conclude from all of this? I think it is reasonable to argue that L6ger's attitude in Ballet micanique to the "machine age" was much more complex than one of extreme and uncompromising commitment. Leger's primary artistic ambition during the period he made Ballet mecanique, it seems, was the representation of a classical ideal of beauty that he found all around him in the present, rather than an unconditional embrace of the machine as a blueprint for a future utopia. While he believed that this ideal of beauty was more intense and omnipresent in modernity than in previous epochs, it appears he did not think that it was anything radically new, instead seeing it as fundamentally continu- ous with previous epochs. And while he thought that the machine often exemplified this ideal, he saw the machine as just one type of object among many others to do so. Thus, he employed many "modern" or "useful" objects in his film rather than just machines, nearly all of which arguably exemplify his classical ideal of beauty. And he attempted, again arguably, to foreground this ideal both by encouraging the spectator to notice the abstract similarities between all these objects, and-under the influence of Epstein's theory-by trying to intensify the perceptual and emotional impact of their beauty on the spectator through the repeated use of the close-up and movement. III I turn now to the standard reading of Ballet mecanique, which argues that the film instantiates the dynamic perceptual experience of reality putatively brought about by the increased pace of modern life. Already it should be apparent from what I have said that this reading contrasts strongly with L6ger's pursuit of a classical ideal of beauty in the period in which he made Ballet micanique. In marked contradistinction to the distinctively modern, dynamic, fragmented, unstable perceptual flux susceptible to constant rupture and violent transition 43. Also, the fact that LUger uses the word "personality" in relation to the machine should warn us about the complexity of the role the machine plays in his artistic practice. For, far from Ballet micanique functioning as a blueprint for the transformation of human beings into machine-like entities, in it-if I am right-L6ger is using the close-up and movement in order to ascribe a human or anthropomorphic quality, namely "personality," to machines. This is a speculative claim that requires more research, and I therefore will not pursue it here, but it is almost as if he believed that by endowing machines and other modern objects with a human property such as a "personality," he would thereby make them more attractive to human spectators. And if this is the case, he had much in common with other machinists of his generation, as I have tried to show in the case of Vertov. See my "Can the Camera See? Mimesis in Man with a Movie Camera," October 89 (Summer 1999).</page><page sequence="21">The Avant-Garde and the "New Spirit" 55 emphasized by Lawder and others, L ger, according to research published after Lawder's influential book, from 1920 onward pursued "the qualities of precision, economy, and equilibrium" associated with the classical, transhistorical ideal of beauty, as is evident in his writings and in the balance of horizontals and verticals in his paintings from 1921 onward. However, L6ger's remarks from this period contrast even more strongly with the standard reading of the film than this new research suggests. In a text from 1924 (the year he finished Ballet mecanique), titled "The Spectacle: Light, Color, Moving Image, Object-Spectacle," we find Leger repeatedly criticizing the dynamic perceptual experience of reality supposedly characteristic of modernity as harmful to human beings. For example, he claims, "The visual world of a large modern city, that vast spectacle that I spoke of in the beginning, is badly orchestrated; in fact, not orchestrated at all. The intensity of the street shatters our nerves and drives us crazy."44 And again: "As long as the economic revolution does not give man the hoped for new equilibrium, as long as he is a victim of the machine instead of being its beneficiary, we will witness that daily phenomenon of people hurrying and scrambling to go to work, to eat, who at night rush to a spectacle in order to try to find distraction from their daily exhaustion."45 And again: "The hypertension of contemporary life, its daily assault on the nerves, is due at least forty percent to the overdynamic exterior environment in which we are obliged to live."46 In 1924, therefore, the perceptual experience of dynamism associated by so many avant-gardists with modern life is an object of criticism in Leger's writings. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, he views the classical ideal of beauty, with its qualities of harmony and order, as the perfect antidote or cure for the disease of this quintessentially modern perceptual experience. "If the spectacle offers intensity, a street, a city, a factory ought to offer an obvious plastic serenity," he claims. "Let's organize exterior life in its domain: form, color, light.... A society without frenzy, calm, ordered, knowing how to live naturally within the Beautiful without exclamation or romanticism."47 Obviously, these remarks, coming in the same year as Leger is completing Ballet micanique, give us good reason to question the standard reading of the film by Lawder and others, which claims that Leger is trying to instantiate in Ballet micanique the very dynamic perceptual experience that, in the extracts I have just cited, he is criticizing as having a deleterious effect on human beings. But there is also evidence available from Leger's unpublished notes on the film to make us doubt this reading, evidence that Lawder and others ignore. For sometimes, far from emphasizing dissonance, rupture, and conflict, Leger 44. LUger, "The Spectacle: Light, Color, Moving Image, Object-Spectacle" (1924), p. 46. 45. Ibid., p. 38. 46.

For example: "Each of the parts [of the film] has its own unity due to the similarity of clusters of object-images which are visually alike or of the same material. That was the goal of construction and it prevents the fragmentation of the film."48 And we also have Bordwell and Thompson's detailed analysis, which-although needing perhaps to be qualified in the light of L6ger's claim that his film is not an abstract film-nevertheless convincingly shows that the film does encourage the spectator to notice abstract similarities between objects in the shots of the film, once again pointing to the pull toward similarity in the film rather than difference and conflict. Nevertheless, there are clearly places in Ballet mecanique that conform to the standard reading of Lawder and others, and that are very dynamic and hard for the spectator to synthesize into ordered relations of similarity. And there are other places in L6ger's unpublished preparatory notes for the film where he clearly points toward his desire to create conflict and dissonance, such as when he talks of a "constant opposition of violent contrasts" in the film. Thus, we seem to be left with two potentially incompatible readings of the aesthetics of the film, both of which are sanctioned by elements of the design of the film itself and remarks L6ger made about his film. Can this incompatibility be resolved? One of L6ger's published statements on the film seems to indicate that it can be. For he says, "Contrasting objects, slow and rapid passages, rest and intensity-the film was constructed on that,"49 a statement that seems to suggest that there is a deliberate push and pull between "rest" and "intensity" in the film; that the film is ultimately a mixture of what L6ger calls the "intensity of the street [that] shatters our nerves and drives us crazy," which he sees as characteris- tic of modern perceptual experience, and the "calm" order of "the Beautiful," the classical ideal, which in 1924 he sees as the antidote or cure for this intensity. However, if this is the case, then once again L6ger's attitude toward social change in Ballet mecanique emerges as a complex one. For although, following the standard reading, the film does at least partially instantiate the new, dynamic perceptual experience of reality associated by avant-gardists with modernity, it certainly does not do so in order to embrace this change unequiv- ocally. Rather, it does so in order to offer an antidote, a cure for this perceptual experience in the form of a transhistorical classical ideal of beauty that is manifested in machines, various other objects, and the human face and figure, their impact intensified by drawing attention to their abstract similarities as well as use of the close-up and movement. Thus, once again we find that Ballet mecanique's stance toward the transformation of society is not one of extreme, uncompromising commitment. 48. Lawder, The Cubist Cinema, p. 131. 49.

In this paper, I have tried to show that the attitude toward fundamental social change in Ballet mecanique is more complex than readings of the film to date have suggested. The important question, I think, is to what extent an avant-garde film such as Ballet mecanique is typical of the European avant-garde of the 1910s and 1920s, and to what extent it is an exception. Increasingly, I have a hunch, following revisionists in art history, that it is typical of avant- garde film of the period, and that, beneath the avant-garde's own rhetoric, there was usually a much more ambivalent, contradictory, sophisticated, and nuanced attitude to radical social transformation than the standard version and the avant-garde's own rhetoric acknowledges.</page></plain_text>
