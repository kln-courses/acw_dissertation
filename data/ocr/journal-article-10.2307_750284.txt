<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE VINE COLUMNS OF OLD ST. PETER'S IN CAROLINGIAN CANON TABLES By Elisabeth Rosenbaum Among the classical works of art which became a source of inspiration to artists of later periods, the vine columns from the shrine of St. Peter in Rome have a particular importance. They are represented on many Renais- sance and Baroque paintings. Jean Fouquet used them in his Book of Hours of E. Chevalier and in his illustrations of Josephus; they appear in one of Raphael's cartoons, and the tapestries made after the designs carried the image of the columns to the North. Bernini modelled the columns of his ciborium in St. Peter's on them, and, generally, their twisted shape appealed to Baroque architects. The legend that at least one of the columns-now in the chapel of Michelangelo's Pieta-came from Solomon's Temple and that Jesus had leaned against it in his disputation with the Doctors, certainly contributed to their fame. In a recent study' it has been shown that long before the Renaissance period the vine columns had been imitated. Mediaeval copies exist in and near Rome.2 In applied art an early replica of the columns is found on the fifth-century ivory casket in Pola. The latest excavations in St. Peter's have given a high degree of probability to the old theory that the Pola casket actually reproduces the old shrine of St. Peter.3 Obviously, this type of column-imported, as it was, from the East-was rare in the classical world. Only two other examples of the same type are known besides those of St. Peter's. Since from an early date onwards the Roman columns, and only they, acquired particular fame, we may assume that wherever copies or imitations of some kind occur, they are inspired by the columns of St. Peter's. This paper is an attempt to use their imagery, testifying to the impression which the ancient sanctuary had made on the imagination of early Christian artists, as an aid in throwing some new light on the history of the Canon Tables with the Evangelists' symbols-the so- called Beast Canon Tables. The earliest painted imitations of the vine columns occur in the Canon Tables of two Carolingian manuscripts, the Gospel-book from Soissons in Paris and the Harley Gospels in the British Museum, two manuscripts belong- The studies on the MSS. of the Ada School in the Libraries in Paris and Rome were made in spring 1952 with the aid of a travelling grant from the Central Research Fund of the University of London; the authorities in charge of the MSS. in the British Museum in London, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the University Libraries in Erlangen and Wiurzburg and the Vatican Library in Rome have kindly allowed me to study the MSS.; the members of the Warburg Institute have helped me with their criticism and advice. For all this assistance I wish to express my gratitude. -J. B. Ward Perkins, "The Shrine of St. Peter and its Twelve Spiral Columns," Journal of Roman Studies, XLII, 1952, p. 21 ff., Pls. I-VII.

The page on which they appear in the Soissons Gospels (f. 7v, P1. I a), the second page of the first Canon, has five columns, three of them twisted. The shafts of the outer pair are decorated with vine foliage in which naked putti are harvesting; the shafts are broken by a double ring of acanthus. The central column on the page is spirally fluted, but the flutes do not run through the length of the shaft; it consists of several panels, all fluted. A comparison with the original columns (P1. Ib) shows what happened: the artist took his model, as it were, to pieces; he omitted the fluted panels which separate the vine panels in the original, leaving only the ring of acanthus in its proper place; and he composed a separate column out of the fluted panels. The relevant page in the Harley Gospels (f. I Iv, Pl. Ic), containing the last part of Canon X in which the passages peculiar to St. John alone are listed, has only the pair of pure vine columns, whose shafts like those in the Soissons Gospels are interrupted by acanthus leaves, but there is no spirally fluted column. The putti in the Soissons Gospels are more naturalistic than those in the Harley Gospels, and the copy seems therefore to be closer to the classical model.2 The fact that the vine columns appear in two Carolingian sets of Canon Tables suggests that they are a feature belonging to an earlier manuscript tradition. And since it is highly probable that only St. Peter's columns can be the ultimate source, it is likely that the model was a manuscript illustrated and written in Rome. The lay-out of the page in which one large arch sur- mounts several smaller arches, would suggest, according to Nordenfalk, the sixth century as terminus post.3 The manuscript containing the vine columns which inspired the two tables in the Soissons and Harley Gospels may have been, therefore, a Roman manuscript written between the sixth and the eighth centuries. Can we, on the evidence of the two Carolingian codices, form a more precise idea of what the entire set of Canon Tables looked like in this manu- script? In analysing the Carolingian Canon Tables in order to reconstruct their Mediterranean models, we shall do well to bear in mind the peculiar selective copying methods of the Carolingian artists, methods which are particularly transparent in the works of the Ada School. Just as Charlemagne's court poets, taking lines or even half lines out of Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and mixing them with their own phrases, created entirely different poems from 1 Soissons Gospels: Paris, Bibl.

PETER'S 3 those of the classical authors,I the illuminators of manuscripts selected one feature from this, another from that manuscript, mixing styles and types from different centuries, even representing a certain pictorial type in the style of a different period.2 We can nevertheless try to retrace their steps and thus add a little to our knowledge of pre-Carolingian Mediterranean book-illumination, of which so little trace has survived. The page with the vine columns in the Soissons Gospels belongs to a set of twelve Canon Tables. This sequence of twelve pages represents the normal shorter Latin version of Canon Tables.3 In this version Canon I takes up the first two pages, Canon II the following three; Canons III, IV and V occupy one page each; Canons VI, VII and VIII together fill the ninth page; the tenth page contains Canon IX and the first part of Canon X (St. Matthew), while parts two and three of this last Canon (St. Mark and St. Luke) are on page eleven and its fourth part (St. John) fills the last page of the sequence. Nordenfalk assumed that the archetype for this version originated in the sixth century and tentatively suggested Rome as its place of origin.4 In a general way the decorative lay-out of the Canon Tables in the Soissons Gospels conforms to the characteristics attributed by Nordenfalk to the archetype.5 The roundness of the columns is well rendered, most of their shafts imitate marble, some are vertically fluted, and two columns on f. I2r (P1. 2f) have straight shafts in which panels with vertical fluting alternate with diagonally fluted ones; this is a form well known from classical monuments.6 Most of the capitals are varieties of the acanthus capital; those on f. Iov (P1. 3a) on which human figures support the abacus may also be derived from classical capitals.' Most of the ornaments on the arches and the motifs crowning them are known from pre-Carolingian Canon Tables.8 The pictures with which we are here concerned are found in the lunettes of the large arches: they are the pictures of the Evangelists' symbols belonging to the gospels which are compared on the table below. In front of a background imitating clouds or rocks the symbols are grouped round an open book or jointly support an unfurled scroll with the headings of the respective table. Only ff. Iov and I Ir (Canon V and Canons VI, VII, VIII-Pl. 3a, b) have illustrations which do not correspond to the orthodox arrangement: on f. Iov where St. Luke's 1 E.g.

Iir we see the fountain of life flanked on either side by an angel and a lion.1 Thus in the first case the fifth Canon receives its illustration only by the strange device of making one of the angels wear the bull's horns,2 and in the second one the lunette contains only the symbols for the sixth Canon (St. Matthew and St. Mark), while those for Canons VII and VIII appear in medallions on the shafts of the columns below. As we shall see later, these deviations have a bearing on the question of the origin of the cycle. Pre-Carolingian examples of this type of Canon Tables with the Evan- gelists' symbols have survived only in a few manuscripts, none of them com- plete, and none of them showing the symbols arranged in groups.3 In the Vatican MS. Barb. 570, written in the South of England or perhaps in Mercia in the later part of the eighth century, the first Canon Table has anthropo- morphic symbols-animal heads on a human torso-and they appear under the small arches ;4 a fragmentary set of Canon Tables in a manuscript of the same period in Maeseyck, written either in a southern English scriptorium or in one on the Continent with a strong Insular tradition, also has the symbols beneath the small arches.5 Of later manuscripts we can leave aside the Codex Aureus in Munich whose Canon Tables obviously copy those of the Soissons Gospels ;6 otherwise the same type of Beast Canon Tables is found only in three manuscripts probably from Fulda; two Carolingian and one Othonian.

Cledat, Le Monastire et la Ne'cropole de Baouit, I, 2, Cairo, I906, P1. XL, where there are many stars inside and outside the mandorla. It seems more likely to be derived from such pictures than to be a transformation of the little cross outside the tabula in the Harley MS. (cf. Friend, Kells, p. 626). See also Brit. Mus. Royal MS.

Of the four folios with Beast Canons now bound in front of the complete Canon Tables which belong to the Gospels, two have no text at all, the two others have the texts of Canons II and III. The two pages of Canon II reproduced by Zimmermann, have, it is true, four Beasts, but this can be ex- plained by the circumstance that the archi- tectural frames which were obviously com- pleted for the whole set before the text was written had four intercolumniations on all pages (like MS. 6I in Traves Cathedral) and that the artist instead of leaving one of the small lunettes empty filled it with the spare symbol or with some other animal. The page with Canon III has a lion instead of the calf above the second column, and a spare calf above the fourth empty column; there is a page without text with the same distribution of Beasts, which would be correct for Canon IV. The page reproduced by Zimmermann, P1. 32oa, may have been intended for Canon V; Pl. 32ob has the Beasts for Canon VI and would probably have had Canons VII and VIII written below VI without symbols; and there is one page with the Beasts for Canons IX and X for Matthew alone, with a second Man above the fourth column. I wish to thank Mr. P. McGurk for letting me use his notes on the Maeseyck Gospels. 6 Cf. Friend, Kells, pp. 621, 625-</page><page sequence="7">THE VINE COLUMNS OF OLD ST. PETER'S 5 lingian ones in Wiirzburg and Erlangen' are generally assumed to belong to the second quarter of the ninth century, and their decoration is so closely related to that of manuscripts of the Ada School that they must be influenced by them, or based on similar models.2 Their pictures of the Evangelists, however, contain certain features not found in surviving Ada manuscripts and therefore afford independent evidence of the tradition to which they belong. They must, therefore, be considered on their own merit. The Othonian Codex Wittekindeus in Berlin, on the other hand, is based either on the Erlangen manuscript or on a common source, and we can therefore exclude it from our study.3 The two sets of Canon Tables of the Gospels in Wiirzburg and Erlangen extend over sixteen pages, and so far correspond to the large Latin sequence. They give three pages to Canon I, four pages to Canon II, one and a half pages to Canon V; Canon VI begins on the second page of Canon V, and ends on the twelfth page which also contains Canon VII; Canons VIII and IX are on the thirteenth page, Canon X for St. Matthew and St. Mark on the fourteenth, and the part for St. Luke and St. John of Canon X fill one page each. The second half of this distribution does not correspond exactly to that established by Nordenfalk as typical of the archetype,4 dated by him also in the sixth century; he assumed that the ornamental motifs were similar to those of the smaller sequence except for the fact that the larger sequence SWiirzburg, University Library, MS.

(Dr. J. Hof- mann of the University Library in Wfirzburg was kind enough to check the verses for me and let me have his transcription.) Professor Kohler drew my attention to the MS. McClean Ig in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge which has on f. Ior the same verses with a few slight variants (M. R. James, Catalogue of the McClean Collection of MSS. in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 1912, p. 34). Since the Canon Tables of the Othonian Codex Wittekindeus from Fulda are iconographically nearly identical with Erlangen, the iconography of this latter, even of its lost pages, can be seen on the plates in A. Boeckler, Der Codex Wittekindeus, Leipzig, 1938. 3 A. Boeckler, who discusses (loc. cit., p. 13 ff.) the Canon Tables of the Erlangen and Wiirzburg MSS. in connexion with the Berlin Wittekindeus, makes all three sets dependent on a lost Ada MS., which was copied most faithfully by the Wittekindeus and the Er- langen MS. whereas the Wurzburg MS., con- taining also some other elements, would represent a more independent version. Even if we assume a lost Ada MS. as model for the Carolingian and the Othonian Fulda Canon Tables, it does not affect our argument; since in that case this lost MS. would be the most faithful copy of the classical model. 4 Nordenfalk, Kanontafeln, p. 211 ff.</page><page sequence="8">6 ELISABETH ROSENBAUM probably had no decorations above the arches. But since none of the early surviving sets of Western or Eastern origin correspond exactly to the arche- types, we may assume that several varieties of Canon Tables existed. With the exception of certain features, which will be discussed presently, the ornamental motifs of the framework in both the Wiirzburg and the Erlangen manuscripts as well as the general arrangement of the symbols are closely related to those in the Soissons Gospels. Part of these exceptions also occur, however, in the Harley Gospels, that is to say, in the only other manuscript which also includes the vine columns (compare P1. 2d, e with Pls. 5c, 6a, b; and P1. 5b with P1. 5d). This fact alone would be proof enough that the Canon Tables of the Gospel-books in Erlangen and Wiirzburg cannot be copied from the Soissons Gospels or inspired by them. It is more likely that a common model lies behind the Erlangen, Wiirzburg, and Soissons Gospels, and behind at least part of the Harley Gospels. Neither the Erlangen nor the Wiirzburg manuscripts have vine columns, but f. 3r in the Wiirzburg Gospels (P1. 2a) has a pair of twisted and spirally fluted columns; they may be a variant of the vine columns, since twisted columns do not generally occur in the surviving manuscripts of either the Ada School or the School of Fulda.1 The main difference between the sets of the Soissons Gospels on the one hand and the Erlangen and Wiirzburg Gospels on the other is in the number of pages which they occupy. It is obvious that the extension of the Tables over a greater number of pages lends itself particularly well to the Beast iconography, since there are never more than two Canons on one page, and thus there is a smaller chance of a clash between illustrations and text.2 There is in fact no misplacement of symbols at all in the Wiirzburg manuscript and one only in the Erlangen Gospels: on f. gr (Canon VIII-IX-Pl. 2d) both illustration and inscription are wrong. The longer version represented in the manuscripts in Erlangen and Wiirzburg, therefore, seems to be closer to the archetype of the Beast Canon Tables, and the Soissons Tables appear to be an adaptation of the illustration of a sixteen-page sequence to one with a text of only twelve pages. In point of fact, the page with Canons VI, VII and VIII in the Soissons Gospels (f. I Ir-Pl. 3b) betrays quite clearly its fuller source: the symbols for Canons VII and VIII for which no place was left in the lunette appear in medallions on the shafts of the columns.3 In shortening his sequence the artist of the Soissons Gospels follows a tradition which is also found in the Wiirzburg manuscript; he replaces the angel of St. Matthew by the picture of an Evangelist writing (P1. 3d). The picture of the fountain of life or of another round building with a similar symbolical meaning seems to belong to the prototype, since it occurs in the Wiirzburg Gospels (P1. 3d) and was probably also in the Erlangen manuscript.4 The 1 The arcade of St. Mark in the Lorsch Gospels (Boinet, loc. cit., P1. XVII A) has twisted columns of a shape very similar to the central column in Soissons, f. 7v; they occur in none of the other Evangelist pictures and are therefore most probably taken over from a Canon Table. 2 Cf. Friend, Kells, p. 619. 3 Cf. the Beast Canons of the Bible in Le6n Cathedral, MS. 6, where on f. 153r (Canons VII, VIII) separate arches with the proper Beasts for Canon VIII are painted in the lower part of the page (Friend, Kells, PI.

PETER'S 7 picture for Canon V in the Soissons Gospels (Pl. 3a), on the other hand, which occurs nowhere else, does not seem to have belonged originally to a Beast iconography. If we are right in assuming that the Beast iconography was taken from the same manuscript model to which the vine columns also belong, the symbols would be derived from a manuscript written in Rome between the sixth and the eighth centuries. No Mediterranean set or fragment of a set of Beast Canons, however, has survived. The mediaeval Spanish Beast Canon Tables' are not a case in point; they cannot be linked with the archetype for the Soissons, Wuirzburg, and Erlangen Gospels, since their symbols are anthropo- morphic and arranged in a different manner. Anthropomorphic symbols of the Evangelists seem to conform to a Spanish tradition current at least from the seventh century onwards.2 The Spanish Canon Tables do, however, confirm the theory that the original set of all types of Beast Canon Tables belonged to the larger sequence. In about the seventh century, a Beast Canon Table set seems to have been created in Spain, which is reflected not only in the mediaeval Spanish Bibles but also in at least one of the incomplete pre- Carolingian northern examples.3 The composition of the symbols in groups around a book or roll-which certainly belongs to the model used by our manuscripts-is in keeping with the classical tradition. It belongs to the iconography of animals supporting garlands and of genii carrying medallions4 (cf. text figures I and 2 with e.g. Pls. i a, 2b, c).

The Canon Tables of the 9th-century Cod. lat. 27270 in Munich (G. Leidinger, "Ein Prachtevan- geliarium . . .", Sammelblatt des historischen Vereins Ingolstadt, 46, I927, pp- 47-59, G. L. Micheli, L'enluminure du haut moyen age et les influences irlandaises, Brussels, 1939, fig. 157) show yet another type of Beast iconography: the symbols are represented as busts in medallions or lozenges above the small arches. This type may also go back to a 6th-century model, for the heads of the angels appear very much like copies from a 6th-century prototype. The ornaments of the four sur- viving Canon Tables consist of schematized scrolls, geometrical patterns, rosettes, dots, and Insular motifs. This type can also not be connected with the model of our MSS. 4 Cf. also, e.g., S.

The style of the human figures in all four manu- scripts goes together with that of a number of scenes in the initials and span- drels of the Soissons Gospels, the initials of the Harley Gospels and the Cotton Fragment with the Annunciation to Zacharias. The sixth-century date of the model of some of these New Testament scenes, established by Koehler,2 is at least not inconsistent with our assumption that the model of the Beast Canon Tables belonged to the same period. So far, we have neglected the Canon Tables of the Harley Gospels. In fact, apart from the vine columns and the presence of the symbols, they seem different enough from the Soissons Gospels. At the same time, these columns and the Beasts must have been inspired by the same prototype. A detailed analysis will show this more clearly.3 The Canon Tables of the Harley Gospels fill eleven pages, which seems to be a variant of the normal twelve-page sequence.4 Unlike the normal type represented by the Soissons Gospels, Canon III in the Harley Gospels starts at the bottom of the last page of II; the remainder of III and the whole of IV fill the sixth page of the sequence. Canons IX, X (Matthew) and X (Mark) are combined on page nine, and X (Luke) and X (John) receive one page each. Only on the last five pages does the decorative system show any resem- blance to that of the Soissons, Wiirzburg, and Erlangen Gospels. In these pages, besides the vine columns, we have columns with shafts imitating marble, 1 H. Pierce and R. Tyler, L'Art Byzantin, II, Paris, I934, figs. 64-65. 2 W. Koehler, "An Illustrated Evangelist- ary of the Ada School and its Model," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XV, 1952, P. 51 ff. (quoted below: Koehler, Cotton Fragment). 3 The Canon Tables of Harley have been studied extensively by Friend in connexion with the Canon Tables of the Book of Kells (cf. H. Swarzenski's review, Art Bulletin, XXIV, 1942, p. 287 f.). Disregarding the arguments based on the Ada and the two Fulda MSS. which I have tried to put for- ward in this paper, even the relations be- tween Kells and the first part of Harley do not seem to me as close as Friend has assumed. The part of the Kells Tables which has the Beast iconography shows one remarkable in- consistency: the first four pages (Canon I, I-2, II, 1-2) show the Beasts above the small arches, like Harley, but pp. 5 and 6 show them underneath them; the lunettes are here mainly taken up by the headings. It appears to me that the incomplete set of Kells is ultimately derived from two different sources. Beast Canon Tables with the symbols placed under the small arches seem to have been in use in England at least as early as the second half of the 8th century, e.g., MS. Barb. 570 and Maeseyck. This latter MS. has the medallions in the summit of the main arch. The motifs on top of the arches in Kells may well be derived from such medallions. Other details in Kells which point to a connexion with southern English MSS. are the circular forms of the capitals on f. 2v and 3r (Friend, Kells, Pls. IV, V) which should be compared with f. 6r of the Codex Aureus in Stockholm (Zimmermann, loc. cit., P1. 280) and occur also in one folio of the Maeseyck set, and the circular and semicircular bases, which should be compared with the same page of the Codex Aureus and with B.M. Royal MS. I E. VI (Zimmermann, loc. cit., P1. 290). We may thus conclude that the Canon Tables of Kells fit well into the series of Canon Tables with an incomplete Beast iconography which seem to have a tradition in Insular book illumination. This separation of Kells and Harley does not of course exclude a mutual influence of Insular and Continental book illumination about 8o00, but I do not think that the Ada School is more closely related with Kells than with the south English group. 4 The Greek Canon Tables of the MS. 847 in Vienna (6th cent., probably Ravenna) had obviously a sequence of II pages. The dis- tribution of the individual Canons on the pages was not the same as in the Harley MS. Cf. Nordenfalk, Kanontafeln, p. 147 if.</page><page sequence="13">THE VINE COLUMNS OF OLD ST. PETER'S 9 but even on these last five pages all the bases and part of the capitals are different. The decorative motifs in the arches, on the other hand, belong to a group of ornaments similar to those of the Soissons, Wiirzburg, and Erlangen Gospels, and some of the birds are also similar. But here the relation- ship seems to end. The decorative pattern of the first six pages is entirely different. Instead of the round columns we have pilasters rendered as flat ornamented strips, subdivided into three panels filled with schematic scrolls, geometrical patterns and Insular interlacings; similar motifs occur in the arches and in the bases. The capitals have one to three rows of very con- ventionalized acanthus leaves. The composition of the lunette illustrations, too, is quite different from that in the Soissons, Erlangen and Wiirzburg Gospels. In the first six pages, the symbols appear isolated above the column of text which they are supposed to illustrate. They are compressed into a small space, the main part of the lunettes being occupied by two lines of large script divided into two halves by a decorative feature in the centre of the lunette: palm trees surmounted by crosses, or crosses on a stylized plant. This system is maintained throughout the set. But in the three pages reserved for Canons V-X (Mark) (ff. 9v-Iov; cf. P1. 4a, b) the inscriptions have a frame in the form of a tabula ansata supported by the symbols. The crosses are here surrounded by medallions. On f. I I 1 St. Luke's symbol replaces the cross altogether. How can all this be explained? Obviously the Canon Tables of the Harley Gospels are made up from two very different sources. It looks as though a model featuring the Beast iconography were imposed upon a second one whose decoration was not originally designed to include figures. As a matter of fact, in the second half of the set this decorative system appears altered in favour of the model with the Beasts. But it can be shown that in the original design the architectural lay-out of the last five pages was to have been exactly the same as that of the first six pages. For there is a red under- drawing which reveals outlines of bases similar in shape to those in the first half of the set2 (e.g. P1. 4a). The gold outlines of the column shafts form part of a system of lines framing the numerals of the text, and on page eleven these lines appear clearly underneath the colour of the vine columns3 (P1. Ic). The capitals of the columns on ff. 9v (P1. 4b) and I or 4 are of the same type as those on the first six pages. Moreover, on most pages it is obvious that the text was written before the architectural framework was drawn, and at the same time as the gold lines were traced which frame the groups of numbers; the colouring and painting of the ornaments was for the most part the last stage of the work. Only on ff. 7r and 9r (pp. 2 and 6-Pls. 6b, 5b) the painting was finished before the text was written. Thus it appears that the work was executed in stages closely following one upon the other, and perhaps by the same person. It is obvious that the text and the flat architectural framework belong together and were probably taken from the same model throughout. 1 Friend, Kells, Pl. XVI. 2 To be seen particularly clearly on ff. I oV, IIr, IIV. 3 The only difference in the system of lines between the two parts of the set consists in the thin red lines which run along the gold lines in the first six pages, but are missing in the last five. 4 Friend, Kells, P1. XV.</page><page sequence="14">10o ELISABETH ROSENBAUM The inscriptions also belong to this model, and the tabulae are clearly nothing but an afterthought. On ff. 9v (P1. 4b) and I or the ground of these tabulae is left uncoloured (save for the purple strip between the two lines of f. i or), and it can be seen in the original that the white colour of the tabula in f. I ov (P1. 4a) was put on after the inscription had been written. This fact also explains why the small crosses which are everywhere in front of the inscrip- tions, are left outside the tabulae on ff. 9v and Ior; the inscriptions occupied so much space in the lunette that there was no room to include the cross within the frame. Text fig. 3 shows f. 9V as it must have looked prior to the application of the colour and the addition of ornaments and figures; it can be seen that there is no essential difference between this page and the first six pages as they appear in the manuscript and that one decorative scheme was originally envisaged for the whole set.

The sym- metrical treatment of verso and recto pages does not extend to the filling of the spandrels and the arrangement of the symbols (cf. e.g. Pls. 5a, b, 6a, b). In the spandrel fillings of the first three pages we see a motif with which we are familiar: the trees with birds which appear in the Erlangen and Wiirzburg manuscripts, though not in the Soissons Gospels (cf. P1. 2d, e with Pls. 6a, b, 5c). Since the presence of this motif in the Erlangen and Wiirzburg Gospels cannot be explained by a direct dependence on the Harley Gospels it can only come from the common model.' 1 There is no difference in the background treatment of the lunettes between the two parts of the Harley Canon Tables. (Cf. Friend, Kells, p. 622). Only f. 9V (P1. 4b) has the cloudy or rocky background exactly like Erlangen, Wiirzburg, and Soissons; and only</page><page sequence="15">THE VINE COLUMNS OF OLD ST. PETER'S 11 Is it possible that despite the different composition the Beast iconography in the Harley Gospels is derived from the same model as that of the Soissons, Erlangen and Wurzburg Gospels? Indeed, some details make this seem even very probable. The hovering angel off. 7v (P1. 5c) or the gesture of the angel on f. 8v (P1. 5a) who stretches out his arms as if in support of something which is no longer there, can only be explained as having been taken over from a group composition. Similarly the lions in the centre of the three pages for Canon II (cf. Pl. 5a, c) hold an open book or roll precisely like some of the Beasts in the Soissons, Erlangen and Wurzburg Gospels where the book or roll, however, is surrounded and supported by the other symbols. The symbols on f. IOv (P1. 4a) which are supposed to illustrate Canons IX, X (Matthew) and X (Mark) but do not correspond to the text, seem to have been almost literally taken over from Canon V of the model, as it appears in the Wuirzburg and Erlangen manuscripts (P1. 4c, d) where the Beasts support a roll unfurled almost horizontally.' It is even very likely that the framing of the inscriptions in the shape of a tabula was inspired by this very picture. The angel on f. 9r (P1. 5b) is more closely related to the angels of Canon IV in the Erlangen (P1. 5d) and Wiirzburg manuscripts than to any figure of the Soissons Gospels-a fact which again can only be explained by dependence on a common model. Thus it would appear that ultimately the Beast iconography in the Harley, Soissons, Erlangen, and Wuirzburg Gospels goes back to the same prototype, and here the vine columns which were the starting-point of our investigation put the final touch to the argument. For, in connexion with the symbols, they link together two of the four manuscripts. The differences between, on the one hand, the Erlangen and Wuirzburg Gospels-which are, as we have seen, closer copies of the model-and the Harley and Soissons Gospels on the other hand can be explained by the fact that both the Harley and Soissons Gospels had to adapt the longer sequence of the model to the shorter one chosen by both for their text. The additional differences in the Harley Gospels are due to the circumstance that their artist used mainly the decorative system which he found in his source for the text. To adapt the Beast iconography to a normal twelve-page set of Canon Tables is quite a simple task down to Canon IV. It only means leaving out one of the pictures for Canons I and II. From Canon V onwards, however, it becomes more difficult, and it proves quite impossible to provide correct Beast pictures (each Beast illustrating its proper text column) for the page which contains Canons VI, VII, and VIII. In the case of the Soissons Gospels the inconsistencies described above quite logically occur in these two places. For Canon V the painter helped himself by intro- ducing the figure of Christ from an altogether different context; and the two on ff. 6v and 7r (P1. 6a, b) is the background left completely uncoloured. On f. Iov (P1. 4a) the whole lunette is painted purple, and a few plants are indicated, rays emanate from the cross. In all the other lunettes only the lower part has the indication of clouds or rocks, more or less schematized. Cf. the identical treatment of P1. 5a, b with Ic. 1 The angels in this page are-apart from the one on f. gr--the only ones in Harley that have no wings. In Wfirzburg wingless symbols are the rule, those with wings are in the minority, whereas in Erlangen it is the other way round. The model may have had wingless symbols, although this cannot be proved.</page><page sequence="16">12 ELISABETH ROSENBAUM angels seem to have been inspired by a picture like that for Canons V-VI (1) in the Wuirzburg Gospels (P1. 3c). The lunette of the page with Canons VI, VII, VIII simply shows the Beasts for Canon VI duplicated (since each symbol covers two columns); the Erlangen and Wiirzburg manuscripts do the same in similar cases. The artist of the Harley Gospels, however, whose main model deviated from the normal twelve-page arrangement, had some additional difficulties to cope with. He had to omit the Beasts for Canon IV, since his heading only covered Canon III. The fact that the angel on this page belongs to Canon IV in the Erlangen and Wiirzburg Gospels (cf. P1. 5b, d) may indicate that he selected his symbols from the pages of his model which contained Canons III and IV. When he arrived at the page with Canons VI, VII and VIII he, too, like the artist of the Soissons Gospels, chose to illustrate Canon VI, but by one angel and one lion only.' And, as we have seen, he "solved" the difficulty of illustrating his page with Canon IX, X (Matthew) and X (Mark) by taking over the wrong symbols from Canon V of the model. The additional model of the Harley Gospels, the one without the Beasts, had such distinctive features that there is enough evidence in the copy to reconstruct its original appearance and give it date and place. It has been observed by others that the general lay-out of the first six pages of the Harley Gospels is very similar to that of the Ada Gospels in Treves.2 Our own obser- vations concerning the original design of the last five pages enable us to say that this relation dominated the entire set. In fact our fig. 3 (P. o) is almost identical with the corresponding pages of the Treves Gospels (cf. P1. 6c, d). It is a fair guess to conclude from the unfinished state of the decoration of the Treves Gospels that all its Canon Tables were to have had some ornament to fill the gap between the two parts of the inscriptions, such as the cross on the first two pages. The close relation between the Canon Tables of the Treves and Harley Gospels makes it probable that there was a common model behind them and that the features which they have in common were taken from that source. These features are: the architectural system with the flat ornamented pilasters, stepped bases covered with a geometrical or plant ornament, and acanthus capitals consisting of one to three rows of leaves; the squared-out spandrels above the arches; the uncoloured background of the lunettes; the inscriptions in two lines with a gap in the middle; a cross at the beginning of the title, ivy leaves and line ornaments at the end of lines of script and between words; larger crosses in the centre of the lunette; the numerals of the text set in a system of rectangles. Ornamental motifs which are common to both manu- scripts are: the schematized scroll (e.g. P1. 6a, b, c) ; the stalk with thin leaves or twigs branching off (e.g. P1. 5b, e); the geometric patterns in the arches e.g. P1. 5a, f) ; the pattern with the dots in the small arches (e.g. Pls. 5c, 6c). That the shafts in the Harley Gospels are divided into compartments does 1 Friend, Kells, P1. XV. 2Stadtbibliothek, MS. 22. K. Menzel, P. Corssen, H.

This trait belongs to the Insular tradition1 and such a derivation would also account for the frequent occurrence of the Insular interlacing which is almost absent from the Treves Gospels. We may therefore assume that the shafts of the Treves Gospels are more faithful copies of those in the model. In point of fact, the ornamental motifs which occur in the Treves Gospels alone can all be found in late antique manuscripts where they are applied in the same way. The heart pattern (P1. 6d) first occurs as an ornament of architectural frames in the Calendar of 354.2 The pattern of the middle pilasters on ff. 8v and 9gr (P1. 6d) occurs in the Rabula Gospels3 and the MS. syr. 33 of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris.4 The jewel-like motifs are also found in the Calendar of 354.5 However, not only the ornaments peculiar to the Treves Gospels, but also those common to both the Harley and Treves Gospels, i.e. all the decorative motifs claimed for the common model, can be found in surviving late antique and early Byzantine manuscripts, either in the Canon Tables or in the tables of the Calendar.6 The closest similarities are in the manuscripts quoted by Stern as parallels to the Calendar.7 The flat ornamented pilasters, for instance, appear not only in the Calendar, but also in the Syrian Canon Tables,8 in Add. MS. 5 111 in the British Museum,9 and in Vienna MS. 847 ;1o the silhouettes of bases and capitals occur in the Rabula Gospels and MS. syr. 33-1 Some decorative features which occur in the Harley Gospels alone or only sometimes in the Treves Gospels, seem also to have been in the model. I am 1 E.g. the Lindisfarne Gospels. But such shafts occur also in the Syrian Canon Tables, e.g. Rabula Gospels (Florence, Laurenziana, Plut. I, 56, Nordenfalk, Kanontafeln, P1. 132) and Paris, Bibl. Nat., MS. syr. 33 (Norden- falk, Pls. i I6-Ii8, I22, I23). 2 Cf. H. Stern, Le Calendrier de 354. Etude sur son texte et ses illustrations, Paris, I953, p. 321 ff. (quoted below: Stern, Calendar).

Here we find the clue to the place from which the model came. This com- bination of palm trees and crosses is typical of the sarcophagi of Ravenna; and the main forms of the crosses can also be found on these sarcophagi.1 The shape of the palm trees (P1. 6a, b) is remarkably similar to that of the palms on the Pignatta and Exuperantius sarcophagi ;2 and it is, moreover, a shape that is not found outside Ravenna before 8oo00.3 Finally, the plants on the last two pages (P1. Ic) can be related to plants in the mosaic in the vault of the sanctuary in S. Vitale.4 Thus it can be assumed with all probability that the source which contained these elements was a manuscript made in Ravenna.5 Figure 4 (p. Io) shows what one page of this lost manuscript may have looked like. We cannot be certain how the spandrels were decorated. But the palmette-like ornament of the Tr&amp;ves Gospels seems to be more likely to reflect the model than the various fillings of the Harley Gospels.6 To sum up: the vine columns of St. Peter's shrine occurring jointly with Beast Canon Tables in two manuscripts of the Ada School have led us to a fresh assessment of the Beast iconography on Canon Tables. It seems very probable that the prototype for the ninth-century Beast Canon Tables was a sixteen-page set of Canon Tables most accurately reflected in the two Fulda manuscripts in Wiirzburg and Erlangen. The assumption that the vine columns originally belong to this model makes it probable that it was written in Rome. Stylistic considerations suggest the sixth century as its date.7 1 M.

Cf. also the plants rising from the spandrels of the cupola of the Baptistery of Neon, Berchem-Clouzot, loc. cit., fig. II I. 5 The Vienna MS. 847 was also probably made in Ravenna. The crosses in the centre of the lunettes frequently occur-in medal- lions similar to those in the second part of the Harley set-in Syrian, Armenian and Greek Canon Tables, e.g. in many pages of the Rabula Canon Tables. For the rest cf. Nordenfalk, Kanontafeln, Pls. 9, I0, 14, I6, 26-30, 32. They are apparently absent from other Latin Canon Tables. This is another argument in favour of an origin of the model for the Harley MS. in Ravenna, where especi- ally in the 6th century the Eastern Roman influence was very strong, and where ap- parently also Greek MSS. were written. 6 Cf. the Acanthus leaves in the spandrels between the arches of the sarcophagus in S. Francesco in Ravenna, Lawrence, loc. cit., fig. 26. Cf. also the MS. Berlin, Hamilton 246, f. 50'ov and i'v, Weitzmann, Buchmalerei, figs. 449, 450. ' The Lorsch Gospels, the only MS. of the Ada School except Soissons which has a 12- page set of Canon Tables, show exactly the same arrangement of the text and decorative motifs with only slight variations (cf. Friend, Kells, p. 624 f., Pls. XVII, XVIII). The lunettes, however, are filled with various forms of tables supported by two angels or a kind of unfurled roll held by one angel (I know only those Tables of which reproduc- tions have been published). This latter motif especially could have been inspired by the Beast iconography. The motif of two angels carrying tables and medallions is such a common feature and has such an uninter- rupted tradition from antiquity to the high Middle Ages that an artist who knew the Beast iconography but wished to avoid the difficulties of adapting it to a shorter sequence might have had recourse to this motif even without a proper MS. model. But it seems quite impossible to account for the very complex Beast iconography of Soissons or of the form of the Harley MS. on ff. 9v-iov by</page><page sequence="21">THE VINE COLUMNS OF OLD ST. PETER'S 15 The considerable number of deviations and inconsistencies in the Canon Tables of one of these manuscripts can be explained by the fact that the Beast and vine column iconography was here combined with another type of Canon Tables, though this type, which had a purely ornamental decoration, was in no way suitable for such an adaptation. This second model, which we can reconstruct fairly accurately with the aid of the Canon Tables of the Treves Gospels, was probably also a sixth-century manuscript, but one which was written in Ravenna.I reference to this simple device. 1 The ornaments of the pilasters and arches of this model and its way of arranging the headings are also reflected in the Canon Tables of the MS. 599 in the Arsenal Library in Paris. This set is otherwise different. It has 16 pages, only two intercolumniations throughout, and shows close relations to the second (complete) Canon Table sequence of the Maeseyck Gospels (cf. Micheli, loc. cit., figs. 159, 16o). I am aware of the fact that the prothesis page in the Harley Gospels and the frontis- piece with the Fountain of Life in the Soissons Gospels both belong to the sequence of the Canon Tables. The problem of the immedi- ate models of these two pictures is, however, so complex that its discussion here would lead us too far away from our point of departure. 2</page></plain_text>
