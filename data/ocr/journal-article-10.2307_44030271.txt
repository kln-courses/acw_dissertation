The Winnipeg Connection looks to the 1940s and '50s to find an answer. During those years Margaret Laurence, Jack Ludwig, Adele Wiseman, Patricia Blondai, John Marlyn and the inimitable John Hirsch came of age to stand beside such distinguished predecessors as Marshall McLuhan, Dorothy Livesay, Sinclair Ross &amp; James Reaney, figures who contributed immensely to the cultural vibrancy of today's city. This collection brings the past alive through articles, personal essays, photographs and more.

The journal examines the theoretical and historical ground by which the West legitimises its position as the ultimate, arbiter of what is significant within this field. Established in 1987, the journal provides a forum for the discussion and (re)appraisal of theory and practice of art, art history and criticism, and the work of artists hitherto marginalised through racial, gender, religious and cultural differences. Dealing with diversity of art practices - visual arts, sculpture, installation, performance, photography, video and film - Third Text addresses the complex cultural realities that emerge when different worldviews meet, and the challenge this poses to Eurocentrism and ethnocentric aesthetic criteria. The journal aims to develop new discourses and radical interdisciplinary scholarships that go beyond the confines of eurocentricity.

Some essays highlight the interrelationship between literature and other dis- ciplines, cultural climates, topical issues, recent discoveries, or divergent art forms and modes of creative activity. Mosaic's essays also explore emerging trends in theory and literary criticism and address the nature and scope of interdisciplinary study itself. Of the four issues the journal publish- es each year, at least one is a special issue that addresses a topic of contemporary concern. Submission Essays must be submitted on disk, preferably in Microsoft Word, along with three double-spaced and single-sided hard copies. The hard copies and disk must include a 50-word abstract. Please use standard margins and number the pages. Mosaic's blind peer-review process requires that the author's name, as well as postal and e-mail addresses, appear on covering letters; it is important that no identifying information appear on either the hard copy or the electronic version of the essay itself. Covering letters must state that the essay is not part of a thesis or dissertation, has not been published previously, and is not being considered for publication in another journal or medium. Manuscripts will not be returned. Preferred length of essays is 6,500 words, to a maximum of 7,500 words. Parenthetical citations and works cited must follow the conventions of the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing, 2nd edition. Mosaic does not print endnotes or footnotes. Essays may be in English or French and may feature illustrations. If an essay is accepted for publication, securing artwork and permissions for illustrations is the sole responsibility of the author. At time of submission, however, simply attach photocopies of suggested illustrations. Mosaic does not publish fiction or poetry.
