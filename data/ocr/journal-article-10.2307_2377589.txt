<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER NOTICES. COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION. By Joseph K. Hart. The Social Welfare Library. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1920. Pp. 225. Price, $2.25. This volume is the first of a series, entitled "The Social Welfare Library," under the general editorship of Dr. Edward T. Devine, and as such it has an introduction presenting the point of view of the series. In the opinion of the editor, social work during the past ten years has concen- trated upon technique at the risk of losing the larger view of social condi- tions, forces and motives. The Library is intended to contribute to social thinking rather than to technique. This opening volume by Dr. Hart, well known to students of social as- pects of education because of his Democracy in Education, is well conceived</page><page sequence="2">344 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. for the purpose stated. Anyone who is aiming not merely to put over some "stunt" in the way of a pageant, or a playground, or a council, but to study the deeper aspects of community life and development, to consider the relations of individual and community, to reflect upon the democratic ideal of life and society, to understand the obstructions in the way, and to analyze the necessary conditions for community deliberation, will find abundant stimulus and valuable suggestion. Somewhere between the short and easy methods of the enthusiast on the one hand, and the over- philosophic and too timid attitude on the other, these extremely intricate problems of community organization must be worked out. This volume is an excellent beginning. J. H. T. BOLSHEVISM: THEORY AND PRACTICE. By Bertrand Russell. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920. Pp. 192. Price, $2.00. As indicated by the title, this volume falls into two parts; Part I, Present Conditions; Part II, Bolshevik Theory. Considerable material of Part I has already appeared in print where it attracted attention because of the frankness of Mr. Russell's comments. The fact that he does not be- lieve in the present organization of society in Western Europe, and that he went to Russia a Communist (p. 41), makes his report of actual conditions more convincing. The discussion of Bolshevik theory in Part II is writ- ten in the same spirit as his report of facts-fair and very frank. In the opinion of the author "the civilized world seems almost certain, sooner or later, to follow the example of Russia in attempting a Communist organi- zation of society. I believe that the attempt is essential to the progress and happiness of mankind during the next few centuries, but I believe also that the transition has appalling dangers. I believe that, if the Bolshevik theory as to the method of transition is adopted by Communists in Western nations, the result will be a prolonged chaos, leading neither to Commu- nism nor to any other civilized system, but to a relapse in to the barbarism of the Dark Ages. In the interests of Communism, no less than in the in- terests of civilization, I think it imperative that the Russian failure should be admitted and analyzed." (p. 169). The result of Mr. Russell's analyses is that the purposes of Communism cannot succeed by inaugurat- ing the system in a country where the majority are hostile. Communism to have a fair chance must be inaugurated in a prosperous country, but a prosperous country will not be converted by arguments of hate. The appeal must be to hope. Self-government in industry is an important step toward building a new world. J. H. T. THE REVIVAL OF MARXISM. By J. Shield Nicholson, Sc.D., LL.D. London: John Murray, 1920. Pp. vi, 145. Price, 6s. net. Professor Nicholson's book&amp; is the result of re-reading Marx in the light of recent events and to account for the very definite popularity of Marxism to-day, whether interpreted by Lenin or Kautsky. He was prepared to find on re-reading the Marxian critique of capitalism, some ideas that might be of service, some degree of illumination, but was only confirmed in his be- lief that Marx was a very unscientific economist. Marx was not the Darwin of political economy. If Marx had really made some great origi- nal discovery in the most fundamental theory of economics it would have been impossible for his work to have been set aside and neglected. Any impression made by Capital was not due to the theory of value expounded</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS. 345 with such diffuse obscurity in the first part of the book, but to the fervid attack on the capitalistic system. To some extent, Professor Nicholson accounts for the popularity of Marx by the fact that his system holds in solution contradictory aims and methods. Capital has become a sacred book, the Koran of opposing sects, at first Loria and Engels, now Lenin and Kautsky, and Professor Nicholson's summary of the divergent inter- pretations of Kautsky, the German majority socialist, and Lenin are well worth reading. M. J. PRINCIPLES OF REVOLUTION. By C. Delisle Burns. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., 1920. Pp. 155. Price, 5s. net. The book is not a revolutionary hand-book, but a study in ideas, which are rightly enough termed revolutionary, those of Rousseau, Marx, Mazzini, Morris, and Tolstoy. The Russian Soviet Republic is barely mentioned; the treatment is detached, academic, and critico-historical, designed, one would imagine, to arrest the general reader rather than for the disciples of his five revolutionaries. With the last chapters, however, we are on higher and other ground; and Mr. Burns, prescient of coming change, looks revolution in the face. He wishes something more complete than a change of power, and disturbance of vested interests-a change in the "inner heart of evil," a real revolution not based on economics or poli- tics, but upon social idealism vaster than can be inspired by the desire for commodities or for laws. In fact, the revolutionary must believe in "another" world in order to establish a world worth having. The attitude is that of a whole-hearted idealist. "We do not yet know what man will be when at last he appears (he writes); there have been hints of it in the past,-there are some persons in every age who are at least at moments, wholly human, but the sacred thing itself is not yet fully achieved, and it cannot be achieved except by the deliberate will and knowledge sufficient to control the unmoral forces of natural evolution." In spite of such large hopes, Mr. Burns is a reasonable revolutionary, looking forward to a con- structive and bloodless change, inspired by the complementary ideas of the five men whose work he so ably interprets. M. J. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. By Zechariah Chafee, Jr. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920. Pp. 431. After something over a hundred years of mainly continuous sleeping, with brief interruptions during the slavery controversy and the Civil War, the Bill of Rights has again become a living issue. Professor Chafee has summarized and discussed the various court proceedings and decisions, the legislation against sedition and anarchy, the deportations, and other aspects of the recent revival of the issue, and in appendices has given a bibliography on the freedom of speech, an index of reported cases under the Espionage Acts, the text of the Espionage Act, and list of the State Stat- utes. It is thus an indispensable guide for anyone who -wishes to form an opinion. The author is very decided in his own views. He believes that one important clarification in the situation came when Justice Holmes was able "to announce with the backing of a unanimous court the rule of clear and present danger which should serve as a guiding principle in the future." On the other hand he believes that there has been a great amount of hys- teria and ill-advised prosecution with a more than questionable stretching of governmental action. J. H. T.</page><page sequence="4">346 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. THE RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS. By James B. Pratt. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1920. Pp. 479. Professor Pratt's book is a notable addition to the rapidly growing litera- ture of the psychology of religion. He is already known to students in this field by his former works on The Psychology of IReligious Belief, and India and Its Faiths. Professor Pratt is a critical realist. After chapters dealing with the definition of religion, the task of the psychology of reli- gion, the concept of the subconscious and the relation of society and the individual, he presents the results of investigations of the religion of child- hood and adolescence, of conversion and revivals. Perhaps the freshest chapters are those treating belief in God and the nature of the Cult. Five chapters are given to the subject of mysticism but with no striking novelty in the method of treatment or the conclusions. The discussion of belief in God and the nature of the Cult offers some very interesting observations. The author shares with most writers on these subjects the lessened emphasis on intellectualism and holds that God is more used than known. He also helps to clear up a certain conflict be- tween the sensuous pictorial representations of God and the more abstract conceptual thinking. Answers to questionnaires show great capacity for holding both imaginative and conceptual elements in mind, though fre- quently the conceptualist regards himself as an atheist because he has dis- missed the imagery. Professor Pratt shows that the sensuous image is often symbolic of the conceptual and that both dogma and pictorial repre- sentation may be of value. This is undoubtedly sound psychology. The candid deacon quoted as saying that his idea of God was " a kind of oblong blur" need not be written down as either a fool or a knave. Evidently the meaning for him was much more than the image would suggest. A fruitful comparison is made between the cult of the Roman Catholic Church direct- ed to the worship of God and that of Protestantism directed to the salva- tion of souls. This is seen in the character of the services, in the architec- ture and decorations of the churches, in the character and manner of the prayers, the music and the sermon, and in the attitudes of the congrega- tion. The sermon has a disproportionate place in Protestantism. The Catholic Churches are therefore more successful with the mystical and de- votional experiences while the Protestants contribute more to the intel- lectual and moral. E. S. AMES. SHALL WE STAND BY THE CHURCH? A Dispassionate Inquiry. By Dur- ant Drake. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1920. Pp. 181. Price, $2.00. In this volume Professor Drake has brought together a number of essays and addresses, most of which have already appeared in various journals. They have, however, a considerable unity in their thought. Their aim is to awaken churches to the crisis which, the author believes, confronts the church because of the large amount of defection or indifference on the part of the more thoughtful and liberal members of the community. Among the points discussed are the attitude of the churches toward industrial problems, difficulties with historic creeds, needless multiplication of churches. Naturally there is no guaranteed "solution" offered, but a frank statement of the problem is the first step. J. H. T. COLLECTED ESSAYS AND REVIEWS. By William James. Edited by Ralph Barton Perry. New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1920. Pp. 516. Price, $3.75. Professor Perry has opportunely gathered together some forty articles written by James through a period of as many years; some of which were</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS. 347 published anonymously, others in such a form as to make them difficult of access. Most important among the latter is the Berkeley address of 1898, "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results," marking the advent of Pragmatism. One point in "The Feeling of Effort," 1880, might be cited to-day as indicating the issue between the two main wings of Pragmatism: "To single out the sense of muscular resistance as the 'force sense' which alone can make us acquainted with the reality of an outward world is an error. . . . If the other senses are too anthropomorphic to be true, so is it also." One finds in these essays James's repeated insistence on the value of Renouvier's work, whose definition of volition, "the stable survival of one representation," enters into James's conception of the freedom of the will. Thus in the essay on "The Feeling of Effort," "to sustain a representation, to think, is what requires the effort, and is the true moral act." As for the determinism in Spencer's Data of Ethics, "until it has been revealed what shall succeed, we are all free to 'go in' for our preferences and try to make them victorious." The original statement of the "James-Lange theory" of the emotions, as given in "What is an Emotion?" 1884, contains much material not included in later reprints and references. Its elaboration, "The Physical Basis of Emotion," 1894, is included in this book. Coming together with the Letters of William James and Professor Perry's List of the Published Writings of William James, this volume-to quote the editor-" when added to those already published will render easily acces- sible nearly all of the author's significant writings." C. F. T. MIND ENERGY. By Henri Bergson. Translated by H. Wildon Carr. New York: Henry Holt and Co., 1920. Pp. 255. A collection of seven papers which were published separately during the past twenty years, among them being "Dreams," 1901, "Memory of the Present and False Recognition," 1908, "Soul and Body," 1912, and "Phan- tasms of the Living and Psychical Research," 1913. "Brain and Thought," 1904, presents the thesis that Realism and Idealism should be treated as two different notation systems, for either of which parallelism implies a self-contradiction. The question occurs to the reader, What does the difference amount to after we have disposed of the issue between the projects or constructs of the kin.esthetic and visual experiences re- spectively? "Intellectual Effort," 1902, suggests a fruitful mode of psy- chological experimentation: the feeling of effort in intellection is produced when the schema of fused experience is being resolved into the juxtaposed parts of idea. In "Life and Consciousness," the Huxley Lecture of 1911, consciousness is declared to be in part the control over the duration span in the future; the faculty of choice is unforseen response. But the transition from "unforeseen "to "unforeseeable "-necessary to make the point cogent -is surreptitious, which vitiates the whole argument. Bergson, Royce, and James have recently been brought to our attention in much the same way, by the publication of fragments that hitherto have been difficult to procure. C. F. T. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY IN ITS PHILOSOPHICAL AND His- TORICAL ASPECT. By H. Wildon Carr, D.Litt. London: Macmillan and Co., Ltd., 1920. Pp. x, 165. Price, 7s. 6d. net. Professor Carr's treatise is an able interpretation and historical exposi- tion of Einstein's theory of relativity. The greater part of the book is a</page><page sequence="6">348 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. study of the problem from its origin, from early Greek philosophers to the position of Leibniz (p. 116). The principle of Leibniz was rejected while Newton's principle has seemed to be confirmed by the advance of science during the last two centuries. But,-if the general principle of relativity be accepted-we are proposing in mathematical and physical science to abandon Newton's philosophy and adopt that of Leibniz. The book, as its title explains, is not for the mathematician; it does not indicate or ex- plain, even in non-mathematical terms, Einstein's formulae; but the his- torical and philosophical aspect of the new concepts of space, time and movement have profound and far-reaching implications. The introduction into pure mathematics or pure physics of a subjective element seems cer- tainly a downright abandonment of the principle in which science is based. The essence of the general principle of relativity now proposed by Einstein is to introduce subjectivism into the arena of physical science. The said principle is that every observer is himself the absolute and not, as has hitherto been supposed, the relative centre of the universe; there is no uni- verse "common to all observers and private to none"; and the reign of what Professor Eddington terms the Newtonion "super-observer" is at an end, challenged by Einstein the leader of the democratic movement. J. E. THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA. By John Holladay Latan6, New York: Doubleday, Page and Co., 1920. Pp. 346. Price, $2.50. A frank discussion of our international morality on this continent, definite as to details and unsparing in criticism. Much of the diplomatic procedure with Great Britain on the Panama question is condemned, not only because of our failure to measure up to our supposedly high moral standards, but also because of the evident lack of technical ability, especially in the case of Mr. Blaine. In our relations with Colombia there is discovered the inconsistency in our refusal to arbi- trate a dispute arising out of the interpretation of a treaty. " The Panama episode . . . made a very bad impression throughout Latin America, where we are still viewed with suspicion." The failure on our part to rec- ognize that moral, as well as physical and financial, losses can be sustained by a nation-particularly where proud Spanish blood is involved-quali- fies the much vaunted acumen of the American business man, whose sup- port of the more aggressive policies toward Latin America has just the op- posite effect on trade relations from what is directly intended. The whole problem of the Monroe Doctrine and Pan-Americanism is found to centre about the Caribbean. The heart of the difficulty is in the weakness of certain states in this zone; while from the standpoint of mili- tary necessity, particularly a policy of defense through naval strategy, the control of this sea and the Gulf of Mexico answers better than a sentimen- tal or nominal control of the rest of South America. President Wilson's acceptance of the mediation of the A B C Powers in his Mexican policy was &lt;'received with enthusiasm and has placed our Latin American relations on a better footing than they have been for years." C. F. T. INTERNATIONAL LABOUR LEGISLATION. By. H. J. W. Hetherington. London: Methuen &amp; Co., 1920. Pp. xii, 194. Price, 6s. net. Professor Hetherington has in this compact and useful book summarized the activity of the International Labour Organisation which entered into active and not unhopeful life as the result of the Peace Conference of 1919. That the first international body (planned as part of the League of Nations)</page><page sequence="7">BOOKS RECEIVED. 349 to come into effective operation was concerned not with political questions of the old order, but with problems of industry is significant of the new es- timate of the views of requirements of the working population. The organisation is so new and its activity so incomplete that it is difficult to come to any estimate of its significance. The broadest and most profound aspect of the work of the Organisation has been in problems of the adjust- ment of the flow of workers from one country to another and the equitable distribution of raw materials among the industrial nations. The begin- ning of international labour organisation was the International Associa- tion for Labour Legislation, which did valuable pioneer work; the present Labour Organisation, following on these lines can effect many things in the way of a "removal of hindrances," and whatever reform is achieved is of especial value from its opening to the organized good-will of men a new field for expression.
