Theory and the Novel: Narrative Reflexivity in the British  Tradition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. xv + 204. $49.95 cloth. In this intelligent, well-researched, and engagingly polemical study, Jeffrey  Williams explores structural markers and interpretive consequences of what he  calls “narrative moments—that is, moments in which the act of narrative itself is  depicted and thus thematized or called into question” (1). Devoting chapters to a  number of major British novels (Tristram Shandy, Joseph Andrews, Wuthering  Heights, Lord Jim, and Heart of Darkness) and to Henry James’s The Turn of the  Screw, Williams argues that self-reflexive narrative moments constitute not optional  ornamentation on but rather “the provisional content of narrative” (5). In making  his case, the author produces a rich synthesis of ideas drawn from narratology, de- construction (especially of the de Manian stripe), and politico-ideological critique.  Theory and the Novel uses all of these resources to rethink that aspect of narrative  communication which Gérard Genette called narration, as opposed to histoire (=  fabula or story) and récit (= sjuzet or discourse), and which Gerald Prince termed  the narrating as opposed to the narrative and the narrated. Not only does the author  seek to redress what he takes to be a general neglect or even elision of narratorial  activity in the theories of Mieke Bal, Seymour Chatman, Genette, Prince, Shlomith  Rimmon-Kenan, and others; what is more, Williams focuses on “narratives of  narrative” (the original title of the study [x]) to highlight how representations of  narrative in narrative serve an ideological function.  Specifically, Williams finds that in the novels he examines, narrative mo- ments work to code narrative as a kind of biophysical essence—as part of what it  means to be human. (At the end of my review I return to the idea that narrative is  an innate human endowment or disposition.) More specifically still, self-reflexive  moments in stories can cue readers to see narrative either as a kind of communica- tive habitus that cuts across all social classes and types (Joseph Andrews), or else  as a transcendental ground for emergent modes of professionalization, whereby  one solidifies one’s identity as a sailor, for example, by virtue of one’s propensity  to tell and and listen to stories (Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim). The narrative  of narrative can also work to naturalize a particular, culturally constructed image  of stories as addictive, all-consuming, worth sacrificing everything for; in such  cases narrative moments prompt readers to mold themselves in the image of the  486 Style: Volume 33, No. 3, Fall 1999 </page> <page sequence="2"> Narrative, Reflexivity, and Ideology 487 narrative-obsessed Marlow, who risks life and limb just to have a chance to listen to  Kurtz’s apparently irresistible tales (154-65). Articulating his claims in a distinctly  Althusserian parlance, Williams suggests more broadly that  narrative reflexivity specifies an ideological structure or process; it is a mode that makes  itself inconspicuous but that naturalizes and therefore spurs the reproduction of its own  modal form. The reflexive self-figuring of narrative by narrative functions to disseminate  and propogate an ethos of literature, of “the literary life,” a drive and desire for literature,  and finally to reproduce the system of relations of the institution of literature. Novels [. .  .] constitutively and programmatically glamorize the institution of literature. [. . .] in their  valorization of reading, of the desire for literature, and in general of the literary life, the  social effects of novels is affectively to imprint those who consume them with the taste  and desire precisely to repeat that consumption, to reduplicate and circulate narratives.   (21-22)     The author’s Introduction (1-23) situates his study in the context established  by existing research on narrative, as well as by wider trends in literary criticism  and theory. In framing his analysis Williams makes several trenchant criticisms  of previous narrative-theoretical models, e.g., of their general (Aristotelian) bias  toward defining narratives on the basis of plot or plot-structure, and also their  “foundational schema of narrative on a stepladder or ‘levels’ model” (3). Some of  the author’s remarks about these and other narratological concerns, however, are less  persuasive. Before providing a brief outline of the content of Williams’s insightful,  oftentime brilliant chapters on the individual novels, I should like to dwell for a  moment on features of his “Introduction” that strike me as problematic. I do so (I  hope) not to nitpick or to fault the author for views of narrative theory that happen  to conflict with my own, but rather to point out what I view as general constraints  on research in the field of narrative analysis. In particular, Williams states that his  intention is “not to take potshots at or deride the structural doyens of narrative, for  I fully acknowledge the usefulness [. . .] of the delineations of narrative set out in a  seminal text like Gérard Genette’s Narrative Discourse” (3). Debatably, however,  the author does not come fully to terms with ways in which a number of narrative  theorists have tried to refine and elaborate—rather than jettison—models developed  by structural narratologists. The result is that Williams sometimes denies himself  crucial explanatory resources that could only help ongoing efforts, like the author’s  own, to chart new directions for narratological inquiry.  In a manner paralleling Aristotle’s emphasis on action, narratologists according  to Williams standardly assume plot to be the content that is “transmitted” by the  narrating or narratorial activity, with nonlinguistic actions and incidents constituting  the primary objects of narrative mimesis, not the discursive acts associated with  narrating (4-5; cf. 26-33, 36-38). Although it is true that the Genette of Narrative  Discourse (a book originally published in 1972) named narratorial action only to  neglect it, over the past thirty years a very rich literature has grown up around the  problem of representations of discourse in narrative, including Lubomír Doleel’s  pioneering 1973 study of Narrative Modes in Czech Literature, Ann Banfield’s  </page> <page sequence="3"> 488 David Herman study of the narratorial acts she associates exclusively with fictional narrative and  calls “unspeakable sentences,” and Monika Fludernik’s monumental 1993 book  on The Fictions of Language and the Languages of Fiction. Similarly, Williams  goes on in both chapter 1 and chapter 2 to criticize Prince for relegating narratorial  actions to the category of “signs of the narrating” in his 1982 book Narratology:  The Form and Functioning of Narrative (32; 66, 71). But in an article on “Narrative  Pragmatics, Message, and Point” published a year later, Prince draws on develop- ments in linguistics (i.e., relevance theory) to argue that narratives carry a point  because of how they are situated in a context. More precisely, the point of a story  can be ascertained only on the basis of how its telling results in a change of the  contextual presuppositions that define the pre-narrative versus the post-narrative  situation. Prince’s model thus makes narratorial activity, or the way telling is an- chored in a particular context, definitive of narrative, not so much dross that needs  to be done away with to get to the core element of plot. More generally, it strikes  me as reductive to claim that narratology has as a whole neglected the instance of  narration in favor of the instance of the narrative or the instance of the narrated.  In critiquing what he calls the “levels” model of narrative structure, Williams  again seems to overstate his case. In a preliminary discussion of Tristram Shandy,  the author asserts that “while the fictional construct called ‘Tristram’ embeds the  putative plot, that construct has no superior ontological status to the fiction ‘he’  exposes. While it is true to point out the fictionality of the previous level, the prior  level is not any more ontologically valid or referentially assured than the embedded  level” (8; cf. 38-40, 80).1 Here Williams denies a distinction that he will himself  later exploit, notably in his remarks on framing in chapter 3 (see, especially, 120- 25). Claiming that Tristram is no less fictional than the stories his account embeds  is not tantamount to negating the difference between the ontological status of the  storyworld in which he performs his illocutionary acts of telling, on the one hand,  and the ontological status of the storyworlds invoked by those narratorial acts, on  the other hand. Indeed, without distinctions between embedding and embedded  storyworlds, metaleptic transgressions of an author into the world of his or her  characters (Flann O’Brien) or vice versa (Pirandello) would not be perceptibly  different from narratorial acts that do not involve such boundary-crossing.  Furthermore, one should hesitate before charging Genette—the author, after  all, of a subtle and voluminous study called Mimologics—with some sort of naïve  equation of the baseline diegetic level with direct imitation of “reality,” as Williams  sometimes seems to do (3-4, 29-30). Genette defines the diegetic not absolutely  but relationally, not as the level that captures what is to be mimed out there in the  world, but rather as the storyworld against which other, embedding or embedded  storyworlds can be evoked through identifiable and classifiable illocutionary (e.g.,  narratorial) acts. Manfred Jahn’s recent work on garden-path narratives arrives at a  similar conclusion, showing how narratives (such as James Thurber’s “The Secret  Life of Walter Mitty”) can effectuate surprise by first cuing readers to interpret an  </page> <page sequence="4"> Narrative, Reflexivity, and Ideology 489 embedded narrative as the diegetic baseline, but then revealing it to be a dreamworld  inhabited by the protagonist. To be sure, narrative theorists must continue to work  on refining Genette’s theory of narration and on building a more dynamic model  of the relationships between embedding and embedded storyworlds as elements  of narrative comprehension (along these lines see, in addition to Jahn’s essay,  Marie-Laure Ryan’s Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and Narrative Theory,  Catherine Emmott’s Narrative Comprehension, and the essays collected in Judith  F. Duchan’s, Gail A. Bruder’s, and Lynne E. Hewitt’s Deixis in Narrative). But  refinement, in this connection, surely does not mean losing the ability to account  for differences in the actuality-status of storyworld components. Nor should it mean  abandoning efforts to develop a principled classification of the illocutionary devices  that make such differences palpable—and salient—in a given narrative context.  Other issues raised by the Introduction merit comment as well. For example,  the author takes reflexivity to be the hallmark of specifically literary narrative,  arguing that the narrative of narrative can be considered a form of “excess [that  is] a mark of literariness, an excess that is not tolerated in normative forms of col- loquial communication” (5). As interactional sociolinguists such as J. J. Gumperz  and Ron and Suzanne Scollon have shown, however, all communicative behavior  is marked by self-reflexivity. Linguists in this research tradition, building in part  on Gregory Bateson’s work, have made compelling arguments for the view that in  issuing a message those engaged in communication inevitably issue a “metames- sage” or “contextualization cue” as well. In other words, in telling you a story I  do not just recount to you the events of the story but signal that what I am doing is  telling you a story, as opposed to arguing with you, lecturing you, berating you, or  whatnot. Thus, I do not just issue a message but provide cues as to how that mes- sage should be contextualized as well. On the one hand, sociolinguistic research  of this sort confirms Williams’s claim that narratorial activity should be accorded  more attention in studies of narrative. But on the other hand, it also suggests that  a self-reflexive signalling of narratorial activity cannot be used as a criterion for  demarcating literary from nonliterary narratives. By the same token, it becomes  harder to maintain that what Williams calls narrative moments necessarily or al- ways serve an ideological function of valorizing the desirability of narrative for  its own sake. Reflexivity seems to be built into the narrative apparatus, as a way of  diminishing the likelihood that stories will be mistaken for other communicative  modes, other types of speech events.  In turn, questions about the status of reflexivity in narrative communication  point to the broader issue—one not explicitly addressed by the author—of the  relationship between literary and nonliterary narrative. Although Williams’s chief  topic is the novel, or more precisely the group of (mainly British) novels he uses  as his tutor texts, it is sometimes unclear whether the author’s claims are meant  to extend beyond the (British) novel to narrative as such. For example, when Wil- liams finds fault with “criticism [that] frames its discussions of novels as if their  </page> <page sequence="5"> 490 David Herman characters act, think, and live in the way that actually existing human beings do [. .  .] i.e., criticism [that] talks about characters affectionately, as if they were people”  (8), it is important to be able to fix the scope of the author’s claims.2 Williams here  seems to be disputing, in a highly general way, the validity of the “naturalizing”  strategies that Fludernik discusses in Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology. For Flud- ernik, recipients of narratives regularly and predictably deploy such strategies in an  effort to assimilate even the most wildly experimental fictions to viewing, telling,  acting, and experiencing parameters associated with canonical instances of stories  told during face-to-face interaction. Hence a scale connects oral narratives with  sophisticated written narratives like the ones found in postmodern novels.  By contrast, Williams does not squarely address the question of whether the  distinction between literary and nonliterary narrative is gradient (= more or less)  or binary (= either/or). It therefore remains unclear exactly why, according to the  author, applying naturalistic acTing parameters to characters in novels should be  branded as “ideological” (8-9). Is it because novels are wholly unlike conversational  narratives about people you or I might know, and thus require wholly different  techniques of interpretation? Or is it because even in oral narratives naturalizing  strategies carry an ideological charge? The first claim does not go without saying,  and at least requires argumentation. The second claim seems equally controvert- ible. As Jonathan Culler showed some twenty-five years ago in his discussion of  naturalization and vraisemblance in Structuralist Poetics (131-60), there are a  number of different senses of naturalization, not all of them perniciously rooted  in ideology. For example, when I brake my car to come to a complete stop at a  stoplight that has turned red, I am “naturalizing” my current experience by way of  past experiences at stoplights, which have taught me the correct or at least societally  acceptable protocols for starting and stopping. I do not just sit there staring haplessly  at the onset and disappearance of green, yellow, and red colors as they cycle and  recycle through the prespecified sequence. Debatably, to suggest that this sort of  naturalization works to perpetuate and reproduce ideology is to stretch the concept  of ideology too thin. Likewise, one may not be warranted in assimilating under the  notion of “ideology” all the narrative moments that Williams so skilfully excavates,  analyzes, and catalogs. Reflexive moments that hyperbolically celebrate the life- sustaining power and addictiveness of stories, quite possibly yes; but moments that  work to signal merely that storytelling is underway (as in, say, the opening pages  of Jerry Stahl’s memoir Permanent Midnight), quite probably not.  That said, however, Williams’s separate chapters compellingly explore how,  in the novels he studies, narrative moments “invite and persusade us to take up this  strange love and profession of literature, making us into readers, purveyors, and  fans [. . . a]nd hailing us as literary individuals” (22-23). The first chapter, “Narra- tive of Narrative” (24-50), focuses on Sterne’s Tristram Shandy. Standing received  critical opinion on its head, the chapter argues that Tristram’s digressive recounting  of his own writing of the narrative(s) is in actual fact the central if not the primary  </page> <page sequence="6"> Narrative, Reflexivity, and Ideology 491 focus of the novel. The author shows that the text is permeated with commentary  on strategies and devices of narrative and also constantly spins out metaphors for  storytelling. As Williams puts it, “Tristram Shandy demonstrates a kind of narrative  metaphorrhea, and part of its humor derives from this frequent intoning of figures  for narrative” (49). Thus, the dominant plot of the novel concerns not Tristram’s  life and adventures, but rather the plot of his writing of the narrative of his life and  adventures. Chapter 1, then, shows how a logic of narrative reflexivity structures  what only appears to be a haphazardly digressive plot. By contrast, chapter 2,  “Narrative Improper” (51-98), shows how an ostensibly “straight” narrative such  as Fielding’s Joseph Andrews exhibits a counterlogic of reflexivity. For one thing,  despite the novel’s being concerned with a journey that unfolds sequentially in time,  Joseph’s (and Fanny’s) movements and actions fail to advance the plot by producing  disequilibrium or restoring equilibrium, in the manner Tzvetan Todorov thought  constitutive of stories. Joseph’s movements have rather an iterative and redundant  profile, transforming the plot from a prototypically linear trajectory (problem —&gt;  solution) into an iterative series of obstacles encountered (problem —&gt; problem  —&gt; . . .) (54-55). There is thus repetition of trouble-causing events, not progres- sion toward a telos. This again leads Williams to suggest that the dominant plot  of the Joseph Andrews involves not events in Joseph’s life but rather (in a phrase  echoing R. S. Crane’s typology of plots) “a plot of character of the narrator” (60).  In turn that plot of character encompasses a subplot: one involving the narrator’s  information-gathering activities and attributions of sources for his narrative(s)  (63-66). Because of the centrality of the plot of narration, because of the many  metaphors for narrative that emerge during the narratorial process (66-71), because  of narratorial strata and substrata that figure the act of telling at both a global or  macro- and local or micronarrative level (71-90), Williams draws the conclusion  that, in Joseph Andrews,               the narrative of narrative does not take the place of a signifier [. . .] that stands separate  from and delivers a signified or a group of “narrated” events, events in which reference  an external reality, but indicates the imbrication of narrating—of the mode and rhetoric of  narrative representation—with the narrated, in a receding metonymical chain of narrato- rial relations that feigns but displaces a referential ground, or rather constitutes its own  referential ground. (66) Chapter 3, “Conspicuous Narrative” (99-145), focuses on techniques of fram- ing in The Turn of the Screw and Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. This chapter  contains some of the most fascinating—and brilliantly argued—pages in the book.  For Williams, “[f]rames articulate the rhetorical dynamic of narrative delivery and/ or reception, not simply invoking the mechanical delivery of the narrative but situ- ating the narrative and filling out a context” (100). But a further distinction can be  made between singly and multiply framed narratives: “a single frame stresses the  representation of the rhetorical dynamic of a narrative scenario—the dramatistic  exchange of narrator and narratee(s)—whereas multiple frames stress the projec- </page> <page sequence="7"> 492 David Herman tion of a source and its chain of derivations” (107). In addition, Williams outlines a  new descriptive vocabulary (108-20) for framing topoi, including narrative scenes,  which place a narrative in time and space and separate it from one or more embed- ded narratives; narrative circles, which are groups of characters whose primary  action is the delivery and/or reception of narrative; narrative causes, which account  for how a story has come to be known and why it is being told at a given moment;  and narrative adverts, which are “explicit depictions of the narrative-to-be-told  and of the narrative desire of the narrative circle” (108). The author also sketches  a typology of frames (120-25) that includes prologue frames, which inaugurate a  narrative but do not recur to close the embedded story; bracketing or bookend frames,  which introduce a story and then return to conclude it; and recurring frames, which  complicate the very notion of framing since they lose their “singular, autonomous  position as opening anouncement or as closing bracket” (123). Each of these frame  types, further, can be differentiated into subtypes. Williams goes on to distinguish  between the logic of framing operative in The Turn of the Screw, where the frame  sets up a formalized contest of competing narratives that has likewise governed  critical discussion of James’s novel, and the framing logic operative in Wuthering  Heights, where “[t]he frame does not simply pose an external filter or point of entry,  identifying a source from which the narrative issues and a discernible perspective,  but dispels the supposition of remove and stable transmission” (137).  Chapter 4, “Narrative Calling” (146-83), explores how narrative “calls” and  compels Marlow and other characters in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and Lord  Jim. But the chapter also examines ways in which narrative and professionalism,  the call to tell stories and one’s vocation or “calling,” are imbricated in Conrad’s  tales of sailors at sea. Williams’s goal in the chapter is not only to consider “the  formal attributes of modernist narrative and their place in the development of the  novel, but [also to demonstrate] the ideological ‘mission’ of modern narrative, in  general to normalize and internalize what might be called the culture of the novel,  hypostatizing a hyperbolic desire and drive for narrative, and more specifically to  establish the discerning taste for sophisticated narratives” (153-54). Particularly  subtle and insightful is the author’s account of how, in Lord Jim, the story of Jim  functions as a “vehicle of narrative exchange” for Marlow and his community of  seafaring men. Enabled by self-reflexive narrative moments, “[t]he allegory of nar- rative bonding performatively enacts the allegory of ideological bonding” (172).  This narratively-enabled bonding, in turn, cues readers to use novels like Conrad’s  to help create a parallel enclave of professionalized literary activity. As Williams  puts it, “[i]n their yoking of professionalism and a literary culture based on narra- tive investment, Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim emblematize the masculinized  professional warrants of the modern institution of literature” (179).   The author’s concluding remarks, then, reinforce what may be viewed as the  central claim of Theory and the Novel, as articulated in the Preface: “narrative  reflexivity is the technological armature of an ideological impulse, to reproduce  </page> <page sequence="8"> Narrative, Reflexivity, and Ideology 493 the model of the desire for and irresistible power of literary narrative and thereby  teach the lesson of the naturalness of its consumption” (xi). In the present review,  I hope to have outlined both the possibilities and the limits of arguments Williams  adduces in support of this central claim. The author proves that more careful  study of the types and modes of reflexivity can yield new insights into narrato- rial action, the third, underexplored member of the classical narratological triad  narrated-narrative-narrating. Yet he overextends his argument by suggesting—or  at least by not doing more to ward off the inference—that reflexivity in narrative  always and everywhere operates ideologically. Williams’s panideological model  may derive from a fundamental assumption about the nature of narrative. That  assumption surfaces in a footnote in chapter 3, where the author states that “Peter  Brooks’s claim that narratives ‘lay bare the nature of narration as a form of human  desire’ repeats the ideological mystification of narrative.” By contrast, Williams  holds that “narrative allegorically and ideologically claims its status as natural and  innate, when it is a culturally and historically specific product (those from other  cultures might not find our narratives so compelling)” (118 n.30). Note that, in the  sentence just quoted, the statement placed in parentheses does not entail the state- ment that precedes it. Members of different cultures might very well engage in (and  appreciate) different styles of storytelling, but that does not mean that narrative is  not a universal endowment, the product of an innate disposition to conceptualize  the world according to cognitive prototypes associated with the building of nar- rative sequences. Are narrative structures in fact wholly culturally variable, or do  they pertain in some way to a cognitive endowment of the sort hypothesized by  linguists and psycholinguists examining the human language faculty? The answer  to this question bears crucially on the question of whether (self-reflexive) repre- sentations of narrative as natural and necessary serve an ideological function, in  Williams’s sense. Indeed, narratology itself began as an attempt to articulate the  contrary view, as evidenced by Roland Barthes’s 1966 essay “Introduction to the  Structural Analysis of Narratives.” For Barthes, narrative “begins with the very  history of mankind and there nowhere is nor has been a people without narrative.  [. . .] Caring nothing for the division between good and bad literature, narrative is  international, transhistorical, transcultural: it is simply there, like life itself” (79).  Although it brilliantly highlights ideological dimensions of narrative moments in a  specific group of literary texts, Theory and the Novel does not disprove that using  narrative is as basic a human ability as the ability to use language, to recognize  and differentiate between faces, or to position objects along an axis that stretches  from proximate to distant regions of space. Conceivably, narrative could even be  the source of these other basic—universal—abilities. Notes 1  In passing, note that “validity” is not a meaningful parameter when it comes  to assessing a thing’s ontological status: a person’s actuality status (actual, possible,  </page> <page sequence="9"> 494 David Herman impossible) is something quite distinct from the validity or truth-value (true, false,  undecidable) of propositions used in a narrative account of that person. Hence, the  proposition that Tristram is a digressive narrator is true, while the converse proposi- tion is false, whereas Tristram remains inactual no matter what the truth-value of  the propositions used to characterize him. 2Note that, on page 38, Williams seems to be making a very broad argument  about narrative when he says that the tendency to use the idea of a “physically pres- ent speaking situation” as a template for reading stories is “an anthropomorphic  displacement of the figural relations of narrative.” Given the frequency with which  the word anthropomorphic and its cognates recur in this book, one gets the sense  that cognitive prototypes involving human action and communication should not  be invoked for any narrative.
