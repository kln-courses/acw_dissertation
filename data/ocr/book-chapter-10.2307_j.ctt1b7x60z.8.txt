Over the past twenty-five years,  however, archaeologists have begun to challenge Arthur A. Joyce,   these assumptions by considering a range of forms Sarah B.

Lucido, and   Fargher et al. 2010) along with exploring the ways in Víctor Salazar Chávez which social processes within polities complicate and  limit integration (Barber 2005; Barber and Joyce 2007;  Brumfiel 1992; Joyce 2010; Joyce et al. 2001; Robin 2002;  Yaeger 2003). Archaeologists are increasingly viewing  complex polities as the result of dynamic and ongoing  negotiations among people across salient lines of social  difference—elite and nonelite, urban and rural, center  and periphery (Ashmore et al. 2004; Barber and Joyce  2007; Beekman, this volume; Gonlin and Lohse 2007;  Inomata, this volume; Joyce 2009, 2013a). The result- ing perspective creates a more dynamic and contingent  understanding of the history of complex societies in  Mesoamerica and beyond. In this chapter, we build on more than a decade of  research concerning the negotiation of political author- ity in complex societies (Barber 2005, 2013; Barber and  Joyce 2007; Joyce 2000, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013a; Joyce  et al. 2001) to examine initial political centralization DOI: 10.5876/9781607324164.c003 61 </page> <page sequence="2"> during the Terminal Formative Period (150 bce–250 ce) in the lower Río Verde  Valley on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca (figure 3.1). Based on excavations at the  early urban center of Río Viejo, along with regional survey and excavations  at several outlying sites, we examine the historical context for early political  centralization. Rather than focusing on the emergence of a polity whose rul- ing ideas, practices, and institutions came to be established and have a degree  of historical durability, Terminal Formative Río Viejo allows us to explore an  instance where hierarchy and regional rulership were tenuous and short-lived.  Río Viejo therefore provides insights into the kinds of tensions, contradictions,  and conflicts that must be negotiated and worked out for regional political  authority to become institutionalized. We argue that incipient regional political authority in the lower Río Verde  Valley was the outcome of negotiations among the diverse social groups that  inhabited the region. These negotiations involved political and religious prac- tices, ideas, and materials focused on the civic-ceremonial center of Río Viejo,  located on the site’s massive acropolis. By the late Terminal Formative (100–250  ce), the acropolis became a regionally significant place that embodied the his- tory of the many communities in the valley that participated in its construction  and use, thereby facilitating a process through which the kinds of acts that had  for generations defined local places and social groups came to define a polity  (Barber and Joyce 2007). We argue, however, that the diverse entanglements  centered on the acropolis were insufficiently differentiated from practices, places,  people, objects, and beliefs that defined local communities and more traditional,  corporate, and egalitarian forms of leadership. We contrast Terminal Formative  Río Viejo with the early history of the Monte Albán polity, which persisted in  one form or another for over a millennium (Blanton 1978; Joyce 2010). This com- parison leads us to conclude that perhaps the most significant reason why the  Río Viejo polity collapsed after only a handful of generations was the inability of  regional elites to become focal nodes in the kinds of complex and far-reaching  networks of ritual, politics, and economy that led to more cohesive, integrated,  and long-lived polities in other parts of Mesoamerica, such as at Monte Albán. the late Formative rootS oF the río viejo Polity Archaeological research over the past twenty-five years on the Formative  Period in the lower Río Verde Valley has provided a detailed, diachronic data- base that forms the basis of this chapter (Barber 2005, 2013; Barber and Joyce  2007, 2011, 2012; Joyce 1991a, 1991b, 1993, 2008, 2010, 2013a; Joyce and Barber  2011, n.d.; Joyce and Levine 2009; Joyce and Winter 1989; Joyce et al. 1998;  62 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="3"> Figure 3.1. Map of the lower Río Verde, showing archaeological sites mentioned in the  text (drawn by Sarah Barber).  Levine 2002, 2013; Workinger 2002). Archaeological research has included  excavation at the Terminal Formative political seat of Río Viejo and lower- order sites such as Cerro de la Cruz, Cerro de la Virgen, San Francisco de  Arriba, Yugüe, Charco Redondo, Loma Don Genaro, and Barra Quebrada.  Over the past five years, our research has focused on large-scale excavations  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 63 </page> <page sequence="4"> on the acropolis of Río Viejo (Barber and Joyce 2011, 2012; Barber et al. 2013a;  Joyce and Barber 2011, n.d.). A full-coverage regional survey carried out over  164 square kilometers has yielded data on changes in settlement patterns and  social organization (Hedgepeth and Koukopoulos 2012; Joyce et al. 2001).  Finally, paleoenvironmental research has provided data on changes in flood- plain and coastal environments that inform the history of human resource use  (Goman et al. 2005, 2010, 2013; Joyce and Goman 2012; Mueller et al. 2013). The archaeological evidence shows that trends toward population growth  and increasing social complexity that culminated with the Terminal Formative  Río Viejo polity can be traced back to the Middle Formative. During the lat- ter part of the Middle Formative a regional demographic center emerged at  Charco Redondo, which grew to 62 hectares. Current evidence is insufficient  to determine whether the site was a political center or to assess the nature  of social inequality in the region at this time. Population as measured by the  occupational area in the full-coverage survey increased from 64 hectares in the  late Middle Formative (700–400 bce) to 344 hectares by the Late Formative  (400–150 bce) (Hedgepeth and Koukopoulos 2012). Evidence from sediment  cores suggests that environmental changes, including the expansion of the  lower Verde’s floodplain and the creation of coastal estuaries, contributed to  population growth during the latter part of the Formative (Goman et al. 2005,  2013; Mueller et al. 2013). Two demographic centers developed during the Late Formative on the east  side of the river: Charco Redondo at 70 hectares and San Francisco de Arriba  at 95 hectares (Workinger 2002). Monumental construction occurred at both  sites (Butler 2011; Workinger 2002), although evidence for social inequality  is limited ( Joyce 1991a, 1994; 2010:180–86). Most inhabitants of the valley  lived in small sites where communal practices like ritual feasting, cemetery  burial, and collective labor projects defined local groups consisting of mul- tiple households and perhaps entire communities (Barber 2005:95–101; Barber  and Joyce 2007; Barber et al. 2013b; Joyce 1991a, 1994; 2005, 2010:180–86; Joyce  et al. 1998). At the 1.5-hectare site of Cerro de la Cruz, for example, horizontal  excavations exposed a communal cemetery in a modest public building on  the site’s upper terrace ( Joyce 1991a, 1991b, 1994). The remains of forty-nine  individuals were recovered from the cemetery. Most of the burials (86 per- cent) were adults, and none were accompanied by offerings. Adjacent to the  public building, excavations revealed a granite flagstone patio. Three small  storerooms were discovered on the west side of the patio opposite the public  building. Within one of the storerooms was a thin organic deposit contain- ing over 1,000 fragments of charred maize (Woodard 1991:869). A hearth of 3  64 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="5"> square meters, which far exceeds the size of cooking features typically associ- ated with residences, intruded into the surface of the patio. We interpret the  hearth, midden, and storerooms as evidence for ritual feasting that brought  together multiple households. The evidence for communal rituals and labor projects and the lack of indi- cations of pronounced inequality therefore suggests that Late Formative  authority and identity were defined in terms of horizontal, communal social  relationships rather than hierarchical, exclusionary ones (Barber and Joyce  2007; Joyce 2005, 2010). At both large and small sites, people created socially  meaningful places through the construction and use of shared public spaces  and monumental facilities that embedded collective actions and histories  in specific locations on the landscape. The inhabitants of these places, who  probably would have included the living, the dead, and other animate enti- ties, engaged in feasting, mortuary ceremonies, other rituals, and communal  labor. Late Formative public spaces thus were loci of entanglement where  practices, people, and things became intertwined in ways that constituted a  particular form of community that included a shared history and identity.  As discussed in the next section, the working out of tensions and contra- dictions between new and preexisting forms of community and authority  would be a major site of struggle, negotiation, and contradiction during the  Terminal Formative. community and authority in the terminal Formative Political complexity culminated during the Terminal Formative with the  emergence of an urban center at Río Viejo on the west bank of the river  ( Joyce 2013b). Río Viejo increased in size from a 25-hectare town in the Late  Formative to a 225-hectare urban center by the early Terminal Formative (150  bce–100 ce). Applying formulae developed elsewhere in Mesoamerica to esti- mate population from site area (e.g., Blanton 1978:29–30; Kowalewski et al.  2009:24–25; Sanders et al. 1979), we estimate Río Viejo’s maximum Terminal  Formative population at about 8,500. Regional population grew through this  period based on the area occupied in the survey zone, which reached 775  hectares by the late Terminal Formative. Other large sites included Charco  Redondo, Cerro de la Virgen, Tututepec, and San Francisco de Arriba, all of  which ranged in size from 60 to 72 hectares. Increased inequality is evident in  mortuary offerings, domestic architecture, ceremonial caches, and monumen- tal buildings (Barber 2005, 2013; Barber and Olvera 2012; Barber et al. 2009;  Joyce 2005, 2006, 2010:186–95, 2013b; Joyce and Barber 2011; Mayes and Barber  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 65 </page> <page sequence="6"> 2008). The evidence from Río Viejo and outlying sites in the region show  that during the Terminal Formative, community continued to be constituted  through the construction and use of shared public spaces and monumental  buildings as they had been in the Late Formative. Communal Ceremony Communal ceremonies associated with monumental public buildings and  spaces continued and expanded in scale from the Late Formative, including  mortuary rituals in cemeteries, feasting, and communal caches. At Yugüe, dur- ing the early Terminal Formative, people constructed a public building on  the site’s mixed-use platform (Substructure 1) (Barber 2005:150–206; 2013).  Feasting is indicated by a cooking feature just outside the public building  that included three large jars, burned on their exterior surfaces; one still con- tained whole shells of estuarine mussels. An early Terminal Formative midden  containing sherds, ash, bone, and estuarine shells resulted from a number of  distinct feasting events, while a late Terminal Formative sheet midden was  likely deposited as the result of one or a small number of feasts. During the  late Terminal Formative, Substructure 1 at Yugüe became the location of a  communal cemetery (Barber 2005; Barber et al. 2013b). Unlike the earlier cem- etery at Cerro de la Cruz, the one at Yugüe included people of varying status  levels and a broader range of ages. Additional evidence for the repetitive use of  the public building at Yugüe is in the form of ritual caches. During the early  Terminal Formative, a cache of twenty ceramic vessels was placed in the fill  of Substructure 1 (Barber 2005:164–65; 2013:173–76), and by the late Terminal  Formative, at least fifty cylindrical vessels were cached in the building over an  extended period of time (figure 3.2a). At other sites in the region, public buildings are also associated with evi- dence of feasting, cemeteries, and caching ceremonies. For example, at Charco  Redondo, Butler (2011) excavated part of an early Terminal Formative cem- etery located in a probable public building. At San Francisco de Arriba, people  left ritual caches in the fill of different building phases of the site’s acropolis  (Workinger 2002:185–214). One cache, however, was much more impressive  than the others, consisting of 356 greenstone beads, 27 rock crystal beads, 109  beads of an unidentified stone, 2 greenstone bird head pendants, 2 rock crystal  pendants, fragments of iron ore, 9 locally produced miniature grayware jars,  and disarticulated animal bone. Higher proportions of fancy grayware serving  vessels in nonelite ceramic inventories suggest an increase in ritual feasting in  the region as a whole (Levine 2002, 2013). 66 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="7"> Figure 3.2. Terminal Formative Period ritual offerings in public buildings: (a) cache  of cylindrical vessels at Yugüe (after Barber 2005:figure 6.12); (b) part of the Complex A  offering at Cerro de la Virgen, showing ceramic vessels and vertical stone slabs (courtesy of  Jeff Brzezinski). At Cerro de la Virgen, evidence of both feasting and caching rituals were  associated with the ceremonial center located around the site’s large public  plaza. Along the northeast edge of the plaza, investigations during the 2013  field season recorded an architectural complex (Complex A) consisting of two  low platforms built at right angles to one another, with patios to the north  and south (Brzezinski n.d.). Dug into the surface of both patios were several  hearths, possibly for feasting events; a large hearth far exceeding typical cook- ing features found in residences was also present in the plaza. Beneath the  northern patio of Complex A, excavations exposed an impressive series of  caches. The offerings covered an area of 62 square meters and included 260  ceramic vessels placed in granite-slab compartments (figure 3.2b). The stra- tigraphy and position of the caches and slabs indicate that they consisted of  numerous individual offerings emplaced over an extended period of time. Communal Labor Projects Major communal works projects during the Terminal Formative included  the construction of monumental buildings at Río Viejo and at least nine other  sites, including Charco Redondo, San Francisco de Arriba, Cerro de la Virgen,  and Yugüe (Barber 2005:117–18; Butler 2011; Joyce 2006, 2010:187–91; Joyce et  al. 2013; Workinger 2002:147–230). The scale of construction was considerable,  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 67 </page> <page sequence="8"> even at some smaller settlements. For example, at the 10-hectare site of Yugüe,  on the east side of the river a multiuse platform was built that measured 300  meters by 150 meters and reached 10 meters at its highest point. The summit  of the structure supported public ceremonial space while the flanks supported  residences (Barber 2005). At the 60-hectare hilltop site of Cerro de la Virgen,  northeast of Yugüe, monumental constructions included a ceremonial precinct  that contained a public plaza measuring approximately 2,800 square meters  surrounded by a ballcourt and several public buildings (Barber 2005:138–40). The largest Terminal Formative Period public buildings in the lower Río Verde  Valley were located at Río Viejo. The ceremonial core of the site consisted of  two monumental earthen architectural complexes. The earlier was Mound 9-  Structure 4, which was probably begun at the very end of the Late Formative  and then raised incrementally through subsequent building episodes during  the early Terminal Formative ( Joyce 1991a:364–74). Structure 4 consisted of a  massive rectangular platform, measuring 125 meters by 200 meters and at least  5 meters high, raised over the site’s Late Formative residential areas (A. Joyce  1999). The platform supported four substructures, one of which today rises 12  meters above the floodplain. Toward the end of the early Terminal Formative, the ceremonial center was  shifted approximately 600 meters to the west of Mound 9-Structure 4. The  new ceremonial center was an even larger acropolis that we have designated  Mound 1 ( Joyce 2006; Joyce and Barber 2011; Joyce et al. 2013). In its final  form, the acropolis covered an area of 350 meters by 200 meters and supported  two large substructural platforms rising at least 17 meters above the flood- plain, a sunken patio, and a plaza (figure 3.3). The acropolis was begun late  in the early Terminal Formative, but a major occupation is not evident until  the late Terminal Formative. At this time, the Mound 1 acropolis consisted of  a platform rising at least 6 meters above the floodplain and supporting two  large substructures on its northwestern and eastern sides (Structures 1 and 2,  respectively) both of which stood at least 16 meters high. South of Structures  1 and 2 was a large open space located beneath the area that would become  the sunken patio in the Late Classic. Excavations suggest that during the late  Terminal Formative this space was at the level of the floodplain ( Joyce and  Barber 2011). The use of this space cannot be determined because Formative  Period occupational surfaces are now below groundwater, but we suspect that  it was a large public plaza. The possible plaza was bounded to the south and  west by a 5- to 7-meter-high platform or platforms that may have been con- tinuous with the main part of the acropolis.1 Our estimated total volume for  Mound 1 is 560,050 cubic meters, which is about half the volume of the Sun  68 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="9"> Figure 3.3. Plan of the acropolis at Río Viejo (after Joyce 2005:figure 6).  Pyramid at Teotihuacan, or slightly smaller than Monk’s Mound at Cahokia  ( Joyce et al. 2013:table 5.1). Our conservative estimate of the volume of the  Terminal Formative version of the acropolis is 455,050 square meters. Evidence that construction of the acropolis required the mobilization of a  large labor force from multiple communities comes from excavations in the  platform fill and retaining walls on the acropolis ( Joyce et al. 2013). The stra- tigraphy exposed by the excavations indicates that the acropolis was raised  by a small number of massive fill deposits, likely emplaced over a relatively  short period of time rather than being the result of frequent but smaller scale  construction episodes involving numerous superimposed periods of building  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 69 </page> <page sequence="10"> remodeling, such as observed with the acropolis at San Francisco de Arriba  (Workinger 2002:147–222), Substructure 1 at Yugüe (Barber 2005:150–94), and  Mound 9-Structure 4 at Río Viejo ( Joyce 1991a; Salazar Chávez et al. n.d.).  Although the initial fill layers in the acropolis consisted of unconsolidated  sediment, the majority of the fill revealed unexpectedly diverse and labor- intensive construction techniques. We have identified at least five distinct  forms of fill, including unconsolidated basket loads of sediment, rammed  earth, puddled adobe, and two types of fill utilizing adobe blocks (for more  detailed discussions, see Joyce and Barber 2011; Joyce et al. 2013). We use the  term structured-fill to describe adobe and rammed-earth deposits, since they  would have required greater organization and labor to construct in compari- son with basket loads of unconsolidated sediment or rubble. The variability in  fill construction is mirrored in more formal architectural features, especially  retaining walls, which include adobe bricks and stone masonry (see Barber  and Joyce 2011, 2012; Frederick n.d.; Joyce and Barber 2011, 2013, n.d.; Joyce et  al. 2013; Joyce and Levine 2009). Even within individual walls we see consid- erable variability in construction techniques. For example, an adobe retaining  wall exposed on the western end of the acropolis contained bricks made from  three different clay sources that varied in shape and size and were emplaced  both horizontally and vertically (Egan 2012:367) (figure 3.4). We have found no architectural explanation for the different construc- tion techniques on the acropolis. Instead, the variability in construction fill  and retaining walls suggests to us that at least five distinct work groups were  involved in building the acropolis (e.g., Hastings and Moseley 1975). We  hypothesize that each group used slightly different materials and strategies to  create the stable interior fill of the structure (i.e., basket loads of unconsoli- dated fill plus the four types of structured fill). The construction techniques  also indicate that the acropolis was not built by a permanent work force, since  we would expect to see greater consistency in construction methods, but was  the result of a rotation of work groups carrying out their jobs in slightly dif- ferent ways. Based on estimates of the labor needed to construct the acropolis,  we have argued that workers must have been drawn from both Río Viejo and  the surrounding settlements who were fulfilling obligations to the commu- nity and the nobility at Río Viejo ( Joyce et al. 2013). We have also tentatively  linked some of the specific construction techniques to earlier buildings at Río  Viejo and to buildings at other sites. For example, early Terminal Formative  construction fill on Mound 9-Structure 4 at Río Viejo included a rammed  earth wall that retained unconsolidated fill (Salazar Chávez et al. n.d.). In con- trast, at the site of Loma Don Genaro, located about 6 kilometers southwest  70 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="11"> Figure 3.4. Adobe retaining wall on the western end of the acropolis with bricks made  from three different clay sources (photo by Sarah Barber).  of Río Viejo, we have documented unconsolidated fill and puddled adobe  construction techniques dating to the late Terminal Formative (Lucido et al.  n.d.). At Yugüe, Barber (2005) noted unconsolidated fill and stone and adobe  walls in Terminal Formative architecture. We argue that the diversity of construction techniques found in the acropo- lis, which exceeds that of other sites, resulted from a labor pool drawn from  multiple communities. Participation of people in the construction of the  acropolis, as well as the rituals carried out there, would have acted as practices  that affiliated people with the symbols, institutions, and rulers at Río Viejo.  It is not clear, however, if people from the entire region were engaged physi- cally and symbolically in practices of affiliation centered on Río Viejo and its  politico-religious institutions and authorities. Although regional data indicate  that social inequality increased during the Terminal Formative, evidence per- taining to the rulers of Río Viejo has remained illusory. NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 71 </page> <page sequence="12"> Hierarchy and Authority Excavations throughout the lower Verde region indicate that inequality and  the power of local leaders increased during the Terminal Formative. At Cerro  de la Virgen, Barber (2005, 2013) excavated a high-status house, which was  considerably larger and architecturally more elaborate than typical residences  in the region. The house was located on a large terrace near the summit of the  hill directly above the public plaza, Structure 1, and Complex A, suggesting an  association between elites and public space. The scale of Terminal Formative  monumental buildings also suggests that rulers had considerable power to  mobilize labor (Barber 2005; Barber and Joyce 2007; Joyce 2013b; Joyce and  Barber 2011; Joyce et al.2013). Mortuary evidence suggests rising inequality as well. While most people  interred in the Yugüe cemetery did not have offerings or were accompanied  by a few ceramic vessels or beads made of greenstone or shell, some burials  were marked by exotic offerings or adornments. For example, an adult female  (Burial 8-Individual 8) showed evidence for pyrite incrustations in her upper  incisors. Although dental modification was not necessarily an indicator of high  status in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica (Krejci and Culbert 1995), iron pyrite is  sufficiently rare in the lower Verde that it was likely a socially valued material.  A juvenile (Burial 11-Individual 12) was buried with a string of 36 greenstone  and white stone or shell beads as well as a greenstone pendant carved in the  shape of a human face. The most elaborate burial (Burial 14-Individual 16)  in the cemetery was an adolescent male who was interred wearing a plaster- backed iron ore pectoral and holding an incised flute made from a deer femur  (Barber 2005; Barber and Olvera 2012; Mayes and Barber 2008). Based on  analyses of the iconography on the flute, Barber and Olvera (2012) argue that  this individual was likely a local elite and a ritual specialist with the ability to  contact important nonhuman beings such as divinities and ancestors. Evidence that elites had specialized ritual roles and knowledge also comes  from ritual caches in more restricted and exclusive public buildings. For exam- ple, an unusual offering was recovered beneath the center of Structure 1 at  Cerro de la Virgen, a small public building reached by a stairway ascending  from Complex A. The cache was emplaced on bedrock just prior to the con- struction of Structure 1 and consisted of several ceramic vessels, a small stone  figure, 2 miniature stone thrones, fragments of a stone mask, and a nearly  complete stone mask depicting a rain deity or rain deity impersonator that  was broken prior to deposition (figure 3.5). Another unusual offering associ- ated with a restricted ceremonial building comes from a subfloor cache in  a small public platform at Yugüe (Substructure 2). The cache consisted of a  72 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="13"> Figure 3.5. Offering in Structure 1 from Cerro de la Virgen with stone rain deity mask  (courtesy of Jeff Brzezinski).  coarse brownware cooking jar, grayware sherds, including one from a Valley  of Oaxaca import, half of an incised local grayware bowl, ash, estuarine shell,  fragments of 16 different ceramic earspools, a ceramic figurine, and burned  earth. The incised design on the grayware bowl included an anthropomorphic  image depicting a regional variant of the Zapotec xicani or the Mixtec yahui  (Brzezinski 2011:107–9), a high-status sacrificial specialist who wears a mask  with a long, upturned snout (Urcid 2005:56). The inclusion of the earspools  indicates an association with elite status (R. Joyce 1999). Although excavation data from outlying sites demonstrate inequality in the  Terminal Formative Period, evidence for the nature of rulership and political  authority at Río Viejo has proved difficult to come by, even from the exten- sive excavations on the acropolis. We have found no domestic architecture  that might indicate the location of a noble residence or ruler’s palace. There  is no evidence for tombs or elaborate burials of nobility. We have yet to find  stone monuments with portraits of rulers that date to the Terminal Formative,  as have been recorded in many other regions of Mesoamerica ( Joyce 2010;  Love 1999; Pool 2007). We have investigated at least one elaborate and spa- tially restricted ceremonial space on the acropolis that indicates a degree of  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 73 </page> <page sequence="14"> exclusivity that presumably marked status distinctions. Structure 2 was a large,  stepped platform that supported an adobe superstructure that had remnants  of the only architectural stucco ever found in the valley and a massive stone  retaining wall that would have supported a narrow elevated platform ( Joyce  2006; Joyce et al. 2013). The absence of domestic artifacts or refuse in associa- tion with Structure 2 indicates that it was a public building, possibly a temple.  Yet there are fewer direct indications of elites on the acropolis than at many  of the public buildings we have excavated elsewhere in the region. Instead, we  see evidence for regional political authority in the distribution of the popula- tion, in the coordination required to underwrite monument construction, and  in the sponsorship of large-scale ritual feasts and presumably other rituals on  the acropolis. As discussed in the next section, the evidence suggests to us that  regional authority and political identity were both tenuous and contradictory  to local authority and community identity. the río viejo Polity: contradiction,  negotiation, and collaPSe We see the construction and use of the acropolis at Río Viejo during the late  Terminal Formative as key processes in the constitution of regional political  identity and authority. The relocation of Río Viejo’s site center from Mound  9-Structure 4 to the acropolis would have detached the new ceremonial center  from the long-standing material, symbolic, and practical focus of Rio Viejo’s  local community. Limited excavations in Mound 9-Structure 4 suggest that it  was not used during the late Terminal Formative ( Joyce 1991a; Salazar Chávez  et al. n.d.). By purging the ceremonial center of its exclusively local entangle- ments, the acropolis created the potential for the construction of a regionally  significant place that could have become a material and ideational focal point  in a multi-community polity. Our data suggest, however, that the scaling- up of communal practices and the emergence of incipient forms of regional  authority created points of contradiction and tension relative to long-standing  communal practices and forms of authority at the local level (Barber 2013;  Barber and Joyce 2007; Joyce 2008, 2010:194–96, 2013b; Joyce et al. 2013). The  polity that resulted was tenuous, contested, and short lived. The Contradictions of Local Community and Polity The construction of the acropolis was a massive communal project that drew  on labor from multiple communities in the valley. Yet there is only limited  74 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="15"> evidence for practices that would have continued to draw large numbers of  people to Río Viejo after the acropolis was built. The best documented prac- tice was ritual feasting, the evidence for which is abundant across the acropolis.  Feasting-related features demonstrate that both food preparation and discard  took place at much larger scales than has been found at outlying communities  (Lucido et al. 2013). Ten refuse deposits were recovered on the south and west  sides of the acropolis. Nine of these deposits were located in pits that had been  excavated into Terminal Formative construction fill. The two largest pits were  more than 1.5 meters deep and one was more than 4 meters in diameter. These  features spanned the entire period from the completion of the acropolis, prob- ably early in the second century ce, to the time of the area’s abandonment at  ca. 250 ce. The middens contained ash, thick lenses of estuarine mussel shell,  dense deposits of sherds, and organic sediments. Five of these features were  internally stratified, demonstrating that they were formed by multiple deposi- tional events. The lack of domestic architecture and other features and artifacts  normally associated with residences (e.g., Barber 2005; Gaxiola 1984; Joyce et  al. 1998; Robles García 1988; Winter 1986) on the acropolis indicates that the  middens were formed as the result of nondomestic commensal activities. The  size and number of most of these features is well beyond that of a domestic  refuse deposit. At least some of the food consumed at feasts was probably pre- pared in a huge earth oven discovered at the base of Structure 2 on the acropo- lis (Barber et al. 2013a; Joyce and Barber 2013). Refuse from the oven consisted  of ash, burned sherds, and burned rock that covered an area with a diameter of  at least 10 meters (figure 3.6). The burned rock and sherds were used to retain  heat. Despite the oven’s large size, it is unlikely that it was sufficient to cook  all foods used in feasting, and the absence of storage facilities on the acropolis  indicates that people attending feasts brought food there. The size and contents of the middens suggests that both large-scale and  repeated food consumption was taking place on the acropolis (Lucido et al.  2013). The evidence available thus far does not indicate that feasting on the  acropolis was restricted to the elite. The scale and distribution of commensal  activities makes restricted feasting seem unlikely to us. The ceramics themselves  do not include unusual decorations, surface treatments, or vessel forms that  might indicate elite wares of restricted circulation (cf. Elson and Sherman 2007;  LeCount 2001). These data indicate that large groups of people were brought  together not only in the construction of Río Viejo’s monumental spaces but  also in their subsequent use. The feasting activities can be considered a scaled- up version of practices that had brought together people in ritually charged  ways at other public buildings in the region and a means through which new  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 75 </page> <page sequence="16"> Figure 3.6. Photo of a section of the earth oven on the acropolis at Río Viejo (photo by  Arthur Joyce).  social ties were forged (cf. Monaghan 1995). Yet ritual feasting would have also  drawn people away from ritual activities at public buildings in their home com- munities, which clearly continued as an important focus of ritual action at this  time (Barber 2005; Levine 2002). The increase in obligations of feast sponsors  at both the local and regional level could have taxed people’s abilities to gener- ate surpluses and led to social tensions and conflicts, just as feasting can do in  modern Mixtec communities in Oaxaca (Monaghan 1995:167–89). 76 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="17"> Despite the scale of communal construction and feasting on the acropo- lis, evidence from outlying communities suggests that practices of affiliation  at the regional level did not result in an overarching political identity cen- tered on Río Viejo and its rulers. In fact, the regional evidence suggests that  practices of affiliation and community identity did not extend much beyond  local communities. For example, site orientations, including those of public  buildings, varied from site to site (Barber 2005:210–11). Construction tech- niques of monumental architecture also varied from community to commu- nity, with both rubble fill and unconsolidated sediment used at San Francisco  de Arriba (Workinger 2002) and Cerro de la Virgen (Barber 2005) and vari- ous forms of earthen architecture dominant at other sites, including Cerro de  la Cruz, Yugüe, Loma Don Genaro, Barra Quebrada, and Río Viejo (Barber  2005; Joyce 1991a; Joyce and Barber 2011; Joyce et al. 2013; Lucido et al. n.d.;  Winter and Joyce 1987). Data from ceremonial caches at Yugüe, San Francisco  de Arriba, Cerro de la Virgen, and Loma Don Genaro suggest a pattern of  regional idiosyncrasy in the use of public buildings (Barber 2005, 2013; Barber  et al. 2014; Brzezinski n.d.; Lucido et al. n.d.; Workinger 2002). The contents  and positioning of caches, for instance, was quite variable across the valley.  The San Francisco de Arriba cache, which included crystal and greenstone  artifacts, contained a number of valuable imported items as well as a wide  range of raw materials. At Cerro de la Virgen, the Complex A cache con- sisted almost entirely of cylindrical ceramic vessels, some of which are similar  to those found at San Francisco de Arriba. However, the Cerro de la Virgen  vessels were deposited without associated valuables and within granite slab  compartments—a formation seen nowhere else in the region. Exotic stone  objects were found in Structure 1 at the site, including the stone mask and  thrones, but were quite distinct from those deposited at San Francisco de  Arriba. Caches at Yugüe, on the other hand, did not contain valuable items.  In fact, the two largest caches at the site contained dozens of crudely made  ceramic cylinders that look as if they may have been amateur copies of the  cylindrical offering vessels found at San Francisco de Arriba and Cerro de  la Virgen (Barber et al. 2014). The evidence therefore suggests that, while  there was a regionally shared set of ideas regarding how communities were  defined, there were clear distinctions among sites in the materials and prac- tices through which specific community identities were instantiated. Contrary  to the expectations of many models of early complex societies (e.g., Flannery  1998; Redmond and Spencer 2008), the construction and use of the acropolis  at Río Viejo does not seem to have led to uniformity in religious practices and  architectural canons across the region. NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 77 </page> <page sequence="18"> There is also evidence for points of tension surrounding increasing inequal- ity and the emergence of regional political authorities at Río Viejo. Even  though local leaders were still tied to their communities, as shown by the  excavations at Yugüe, Cerro de la Virgen, and Charco Redondo (Barber 2005,  2013; Barber and Joyce 2007; Barber et al. 2013b; Joyce 2010:186–95), they were  also increasingly distinguishing themselves from others through mortuary  practices, prestige goods, and elaborate residences. Social valuables obtained  through long-distance exchange linked lower Verde elites to those in other  parts of Mesoamerica and contributed to the creation of a high-status identity.  Although prestige goods may have had complex life histories that included  use as adornments and gifts exchanged among prominent people, many  were ultimately consumed in burials and caches and so became entangled  with the community via collective ceremonies. The interment of socially val- ued goods in burials and offerings in public buildings contributed to status  inequality because these objects demonstrated the unique social ties of their  donors. However, the deposition of such materials in nondomestic contexts  converted valuable items into collective resources, thereby transforming hier- archical social distinctions into expressions of traditional communal principles.  Cached valuables thus became inalienable objects that materialized corpo- rate identities and histories (Barber et al. 2014; see also Weiner 1992). The  marking of elite bodies via adornment and prestigious objects, as well as the  elaborate architecture and spatial setting of the high-status house at Cerro  de la Virgen, demonstrate the increasing visibility of high status at the local  level. Their interment in community cemeteries upon death, however, in turn  highlighted elites’ membership in a local collectivity. Likewise, since evidence  for the celebration of rulers and rulership has not been found, it appears that  the construction of monumental buildings with voluntary labor emphasized  corporate action and identity rather than the authority of rulers. The evidence  suggests that rulership and hierarchy were embedded in and constrained by  communal principles, practices, and obligations, resulting in a form of political  authority that Blanton (1998:151) defines as egalitarian. The only possible evidence we see for a regional political identity tied to the  rulers of Río Viejo is in the form of imagery on widely available grayware ves- sels. Brzezinski (2011) shows that the most common iconography on Terminal  Formative Period grayware bowls (figure 3.7) included images pertaining to  widespread Mesoamerican religious themes such as maize, clouds, lightning,  wind, and rain ( Jansen and Pérez Jiménez 2007; Monaghan 1990; Sellen 2011;  Taube 1996). Images of skulls and dead humans, especially on anthropomor- phic vessel appliqués, also suggest the important role of death, and perhaps  78 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="19"> Figure 3.7. Late Terminal Formative iconographic gray wares: (a) conical bowl from  Yugüe with incised maize icon (after Brzezinski 2011:figure 10a); (b) conical bowl from  Cerro de la Cruz with incised cloud icon (after Brzezinski 2011:figure 15); (c) incurving  wall bowl from Yugüe with lightning iconography (after Brzezinski 2011:figure 33a).  sacrifice, in pre-Columbian religion (Brzezinski 2011:105; Hepp and Joyce  2013:277–79). At Yugüe, the imagery on the bone flute from the cemetery and  the grayware bowl fragment from the cache in Substructure 2 suggest that  elites may have taken on more important roles as religious specialists, as has  been seen in other regions of Mesoamerica at this time (Freidel and Schele  1988; Joyce 2000). It is possible that the widely available iconographic ceramics  materialized an ideology that legitimated the central role of rulers in religious  belief and practice in the lower Río Verde Valley, although there is no evidence  suggesting that elites controlled the production or distribution of these vessels.  Rather than the results of an ideology imposed on common people by the  nobility, the wide distribution of iconographic graywares could be a function  of the communal nature of political authority and religious practice. Overall, the evidence suggests to us that people from different communities  in the region participated in the construction and use of the acropolis and rul- ers of Río Viejo gained some degree of political influence over multiple com- munities. These multi-community links, however, appear to us to have been  tenuous and unstable such that Terminal Formative Río Viejo challenges the  limits of what might be defined as a polity. The evidence suggests that author- ity in the region was not singular, and it is likely that newer, more regional  and hierarchical forms of authority existed alongside traditional, commu- nity-based and less hierarchical leadership. Points of tension and negotiation  probably surrounded issues such as participation in feasts and other rituals  on public buildings and the centrality of regional rulers rather than local com- munities in important ceremonies. We suspect that while Río Viejo was the  most powerful political center, people of other communities had considerable  independence and were able to strategically strengthen ties with or create dis- tance from rulers and ruling institutions at Río Viejo. NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 79 </page> <page sequence="20"> The Collapse of Río Viejo The collapse of the late Terminal Formative polity around 250 ce was fol- lowed by a period of political fragmentation in the Early Classic Period (250– 500 ce), showing that Terminal Formative authority was indeed tenuous and  short lived ( Joyce and Barber 2011; Joyce 2005, 2008:234–240). At ca. 250 ce  the archaeological record indicates a dramatic change in regional settlement  and sociopolitical organization. Río Viejo decreased in size from 200 hectares  in the late Terminal Formative to 75 hectares in the Early Classic. Several  other large Terminal Formative floodplain sites with mounded architecture,  including Yugüe, declined significantly in size or were abandoned. Regional  surveys in the lower Río Verde region show a shift to defensible piedmont  locations. During the Early Classic, the region contained perhaps as many as  eight demographic centers of roughly equivalent size. There is little evidence  for monumental building activities, suggesting that leaders were unable to  mobilize large labor forces as they did in the Terminal Formative. The data  indicate that during the Early Classic, multiple, perhaps competing, polities  occupied the lower Río Verde Valley. As a focus of the tenuous regional entanglements that constituted the Río  Viejo polity, it is not surprising that our excavations on the site’s acropolis  show that it was abandoned at ca. 250 ce. While we are still working to under- stand this important social and political transition, our excavations on the  acropolis suggest that people may have formally dismantled or “closed” this  monumental public space as the Formative Period came to an end. Burning of  superstructures and platform surfaces is indicated in the ceremonial building  atop Structure 2 and in a substantial wattle-and-daub public building on the  south edge of the acropolis (Arellano 2012; Joyce et al. 2013; Rivas 2012). In  both areas we recovered burned earthen floors; and in one instance we found  burned daub detritus from no fewer than three separate superstructures. We  cannot rule out the possibility that violence was the cause of this burning and  potentially part of the reason Río Viejo collapsed. Evidence from subsequent  deposits indicates, however, that the acropolis went through a period of ritual  termination, and the final and most extensive episode of burning may have  initiated these ceremonies. At the very end of the late Terminal Formative, immediately following the  burning of these buildings, much of the structure was covered by thin fill  layers and/or deposits of refuse containing high densities of broken ceram- ics that resemble the results of termination ceremonies found in other parts  of Mesoamerica (Elson and Smith 2001; Hamann 2008; Stanton et al. 2008;  Stross 1998; Walker 1998). Most importantly, there were changes in the kinds  80 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="21"> of activities taking place on the acropolis at this time. Stones were removed  from masonry features and superstructures covered by fill were not rebuilt. At  the base of Structure 2, colluvial deposits suggest that the structure was not  being maintained and began to erode. In several areas of the acropolis, sherds  and partial vessels overlay these fill deposits or were placed into pits that had  been excavated into the final layers of earthen fill. These pits varied signifi- cantly in size, but their contents were consistently sherds; whole and partial  vessels, some of which appeared to have been broken in place; and sand. One  pit consisted of sherds and an organic incendiary that were burned in situ. The  fill deposits that overlay the final Terminal Formative strata throughout the  acropolis date to the Late Classic, reiterating that the actions must have been  among the very last undertaken on the acropolis until the area was reoccupied  around 500 ce. Activity on the acropolis changed dramatically in the Early Classic Period,  during which time there was no construction or modification of monumental  spaces. Indeed, some areas may have been mined for sediment to use in con- struction elsewhere given the presence of large pits that were refilled in the  Late Classic Period. During the Late Classic, the acropolis was reoccupied  and once again became the focus of important ceremonies (Baillie 2012; Joyce  et al. 2001). At this time, Río Viejo reemerged as an urban center and political  seat for the region. We are not entirely sure what led to the collapse of the Río Viejo polity and  the ritual termination and abandonment of the acropolis. Although we cannot  entirely rule out interaction and perhaps conflict with distant polities such as  Teotihuacan ( Joyce 2003; cf. Workinger 2013), we increasingly see evidence  for the sorts of tensions and contradictions that developed from regional his- torical processes, such as those surrounding community and authority that  we have delineated in this chapter ( Joyce 2008, 2010, 2013b; Joyce and Barber  2011). In particular, we see fracture points created by new forms of political  authority as well as the more encompassing sets of practices, beliefs, and iden- tities centered on the acropolis at Río Viejo. Contradictions developed during  the Terminal Formative between the newer, more hierarchical and regional  forms of authority and identity that were beginning to emerge at Río Viejo  and long-standing local and communal forms of authority and identity cen- tered on public buildings at places like Yugüe, Cerro de la Virgen, and San  Francisco de Arriba. We see contradictions between peoples’ obligations to  their local communities and to the rulers of Río Viejo. At the same time, Río  Viejo’s rulers were faced with the conflicting demands of hierarchy and com- munity. To extend their political power, the rulers of Río Viejo needed to set  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 81 </page> <page sequence="22"> themselves apart so as to supersede the authority of local leaders and become a  focal point of a new scaled-up regional community. Yet they were operating in  a cultural setting where authority was tightly constrained by local communal  identity and obligations. Similar kinds of contradictions and points of tension  existed at this time in other parts of Mesoamerica and were worked through  in diverse ways, leading to a variety of forms of political organization and  divergent political histories. inStitutionalizing regional authority:  the view From monte albán Our archaeological research in the lower Río Verde Valley shows that Río  Viejo exhibits many of the hallmarks that archaeologists have traditionally  attributed to the kinds of politically centralized and tightly integrated soci- eties normally defined as states. In the case of Río Viejo, these characteris- tics include a five-tiered settlement hierarchy, urbanism, monumental public  architecture, and rulers who were sufficiently powerful to sponsor large labor  projects and public ceremonies. Yet a closer reading of the evidence shows  that people in outlying communities like Yugüe, Cerro de la Virgen, San  Francisco de Arriba, and Loma Don Genaro exhibited considerable indepen- dence from the regional center in ritual practices and architectural techniques  and styles. In contrast to traditional archaeological models of complex politi- cal formations as strongly hierarchical and tightly integrated, our view of the  later Formative Río Viejo polity is that it was neither highly integrated nor  significantly coercive. While Río Viejo challenges assumptions about com- plex polities, it was far from being an isolated case. Throughout much of later  Formative Mesoamerica, people in complex polities were struggling over com- peting forms of political authority (e.g., Cowgill 1997; Joyce 2010; Love 1999;  Pool 2008; Sugiyama 1993). In some cases, such as at Teotihuacan and Monte  Albán, the outcome led to the institutionalization of regional political author- ity, although the form of that authority varied from region to region. Likewise,  while these polities persisted for centuries, their ruling ideas, practices, and  institutions were far from stable. In other cases, including Río Viejo and prob- ably many of the polities of the Mixteca Alta of Oaxaca, regional political  authority was tenuous and short lived ( Joyce 2010:195). The later Formative Monte Albán polity in the highlands of Oaxaca offers  a comparative case to explore some of the factors that could have contributed  to the institutionalization of regional political authority (also see Joyce 2010;  Joyce and Barber 2013). We see a number of points of divergence between  82 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="23"> Monte Albán and Río Viejo that may have had significant consequences in  the history of these polities, especially as they relate to the ability of rulers  to extend their authority across multiple communities throughout a broader  region. In the Valley of Oaxaca, evidence suggests that the rulers of Monte  Albán were initially successful in negotiating shared forms of political control  with more traditional communal forms of leadership. Although we see politi- cal authority in the Late Formative Valley of Oaxaca as largely communal,  Monte Albán’s rulers were successful in linking their authority and identity  to a series of innovations in politico-religious belief and practice that served  to set them apart from local leaders as well as commoners. These innovations  included the increasing control over ritual knowledge and authority centered  on Monte Albán’s Main Plaza as well as the manufacture of social valuables  and the use of coercive force. A focal point in this new relational field was the Main Plaza of Monte  Albán, which was a socially significant place marked by architecture and  imagery that was clearly distinct from previous ceremonial precincts (e.g.,  Blanton 1978; Joyce 2000, 2004; Winter 2001). The Main Plaza had been a  symbol of collective identity and authority during the Late Formative, but  by the Terminal Formative it was increasingly controlled by and restricted to  the nobility ( Joyce 2004:205–7). Associations of elite residences and burials  with religious symbols, spaces, and artifacts, especially the monumental art  and architecture found on the Main Plaza, indicate that the nobility increas- ingly came to control ritual knowledge and authority, although high-ranking  commoners may have also achieved positions of political and religious power  ( Joyce 2010:143; Urcid 2011). Rulers at Monte Albán were successful in gaining control over the manufac- ture of a variety of social valuables through which debts and obligations could  be established and political institutions funded. These items included fancy  creamware ceramics often with post-fire scratch incising and large hollow  supports (Elson and Sherman 2007; Kowalewski et al. 1989:180, 199; Markens  and Martínez 2009). Like the iconographic graywares in the lower Río Verde  Valley, the creamwares often exhibited step-fret designs symbolizing the rain- lightning deity and were part of a pan-Mesoamerican system of elite display.  Unlike the lower Verde graywares, the distribution of creamwares in the Valley  of Oaxaca was markedly status linked. These symbols may have been another  indication of the increasing control of important religious symbols and cer- emonies by powerful elites. Excavations in a nonresidential architectural com- plex on the northwestern corner of the Main Plaza recovered evidence of the  production of shell ornaments and prismatic obsidian blades, suggesting that  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 83 </page> <page sequence="24"> the rulers of Monte Albán may have also controlled the manufacture of these  items (Markens and Martínez 2009). Finally, the rulers of Monte Albán had recourse to coercive force to bring  communities in the valley into compliance. For example, although we ques- tion the degree to which areas outside the valley were conquered (e.g., Joyce  2013c; Workinger and Joyce 2009; Zeitlin and Joyce 1999), there is evidence  that the site of El Palenque, south of Monte Albán, was defeated and incorpo- rated into the Monte Albán polity at ca. 30 bce (Redmond and Spencer 2006).  Warfare included elements of religious ritual through human sacrifice and  ritual preparations for battle ( Joyce 2000; Urcid 2011; Urcid and Joyce 2014).  There are also indications that conflict may have been part of what eventu- ally contributed to the declining influence of communal forms of leadership  and the institutionalization of more hierarchical, exclusionary, and regional  forms of authority centered at Monte Albán ( Joyce 2010:159; Urcid 2011; Urcid  and Joyce 2014). Evidence from the end of the Terminal Formative suggests  that these tensions may have erupted in a political upheaval at Monte Albán  around 200 ce. At this time, several major iconographic programs on the Main  Plaza were dismantled and some monuments were defaced and buried under  new buildings. A temple on the North Platform was burned and a defensive  wall was built around parts of the site. One access point onto the Main Plaza  was probably monitored through military force. Since these iconographic pro- grams downplay the power of rulers, and in some cases probably represent  communal forms of leadership, their dismantling and destruction may directly  reflect the suppression of communal authority that had existed alongside the  hierarchical rulers of the polity ( Joyce 2010; Urcid 2011; Urcid and Joyce 2014).  Evidence for the increasing formalization of status distinctions by the Early  Classic Period and iconography celebrating the religious and political power  of rulers suggest that the more exclusionary and hierarchical forms of author- ity gained prominence over competing forms of leadership ( Joyce 2004, 2010). concluSionS In contrast to Monte Albán, in the lower Río Verde Valley regional political  identity and authority were never extended across multiple communities at  the end of the Formative Period. Despite the scale of monumental construc- tion at Río Viejo, the regional polity seems to have been weakly integrated and  tenuous. There are few indications of innovations in religious, political, and  economic practices that would have distinguished rulers from followers and  created sources of goods or specialized knowledge not available at the local  84 JOYCE, BARBER, BRZEZINSKI, LUCIDO, AND SALAZAR CHáVEZ </page> <page sequence="25"> level. Instead, what seems to have been new in terms of political relationships  was limited to a scaling-up of traditional practices that had previously mate- rialized notions of local community identity, including monumental construc- tion programs and ritual feasting. The active maintenance of strong commu- nity identities limited the degree to which the authority of the rulers of Río  Viejo could be extended across the region. The Río Viejo polity was never a  cohesive political formation and lasted no more than a century or two at most.  Because the contradictions and tensions that contributed to the collapse of  the Río Viejo polity were never overcome, sites of struggle and negotiation  are more accessible to archaeological study. Unlike in the Valley of Oaxaca,  victorious regional rulers never suppressed the evidence of competing forms of  authority and internal political conflict. Río Viejo therefore has the potential  to provide important insights on the kinds of political struggles, negotiations,  and conflicts that are inherent to all complex political formations. We agree with Inomata (this volume) that the negotiation of political  authority extends well beyond the strategies that polity rulers take to work out  contradictions surrounding inequality and social solidarity as well as those per- taining to the balance between coercion and integration (also see Barber 2005;  Barber and Joyce 2007; Joyce 2000, 2008, 2010; Joyce et al. 2001; Murakami,  this volume; cf. Baron, this volume; Kurnick, this volume). Likewise, we view  contradictions that crosscut salient social distinctions involving belief and  socioeconomic interest and opportunity as more significant in social nego- tiations than those faced by polity rulers in political decision-making (see  Brumfiel 1996; Giddens 1979; Marx and Engels 1998). We argue that in the  lower Río Verde Valley, as in all complex societies, the negotiation of political  authority was far more complex than elite power strategies or simple polari- ties surrounding the interests and agency of elites and commoners (also see  Beekman, this volume). For example, we cannot be sure of the reasons for the  construction of the acropolis at Río Viejo. Those reasons may have involved  some sort of political strategy by rulers or instead might have been motivated  by issues related to religion. What is more important and archaeologically  accessible, however, is how the ramifying effects of the construction of the  acropolis created contradictions and tensions between the newer, more hier- archical and regional forms of authority and identity that were beginning to  emerge at Río Viejo and long-standing local and communal forms of author- ity and identity centered on public buildings at outlying sites. Our research  leads us to argue that the negotiation of these contradictions was focused  on the centrality of Río Viejo’s rulers versus local communities in the con- struction and ceremonial use of public buildings through which community  NEGOTIATING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND COMMUNITY IN COASTAL OAXACA 85 </page> <page sequence="26"> was constituted. From this perspective, the most acute tensions may have sur- rounded contradictions between the interests of Río Viejo’s rulers and those  of elites at outlying communities as well as between elites and commoners. As  early as the Late Formative, if not before, public buildings at outlying sites  were loci of entanglement, where ceremonial practices, people, bodies interred  in cemeteries, and emplaced offerings became intertwined in ways that consti- tuted a particular form of community that included a shared history and iden- tity. Regardless of what may have motivated the construction of the acropolis  at Río Viejo, our evidence shows that such entanglements were never scaled- up to the regional level. Although the rulers of Río Viejo were probably able  to mobilize labor from surrounding communities for the construction of the  acropolis, in contrast to Monte Albán, these regional political relationships  were never institutionalized in ways that contributed to the creation of a pol- ity with a degree of durability. Instead, incipient regional authority was tightly  constrained by local communal identity and obligations. The working out of  these contradictions and tensions contributed to the abandonment of the  acropolis and the decline of Río Viejo in size and regional prominence. acknowledgmentS We would like to thank the people of the lower Río Verde Valley for their  friendship and assistance through the years as well as the Consejo de Arqueo- logía and Centro INAH Oaxaca of the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antro- pología e Historia.
