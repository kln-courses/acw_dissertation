<plain_text><page sequence="1">EURIPIDES L. H. G. GREENWOOD: Aspects of Euripidean Tragedy. Pp. vii+ 144. Cambridge: University Press, I953. Cloth, i8s. net. THIS little book is urbanely composed and argued (some of it before I939) and this and its comparative freedom from learned apparatus, combined with the attractive production of the Cambridge Press, make it a pleasure to read. Mr. Greenwood makes no attempt to discuss Euripides' poetic and dramatic qualities, which he takes for granted, but concerns himself with the hindrance to appreciating these which might arise from a failure to understand the poet's commonest 'subsidiary purpose' in writing, which he thinks was religious satire. He starts from the old difficulty that, 'whereas the poet's representation of the nature and actions of the gods in many of his plays, if not in all, conflicts sharply with what appear to be his own religious beliefs, nevertheless these gods and their activities are presented as an integral and irremovable element of the whole'. Rejecting the idea that there is a second story beneath the surface of the plays, and believing that it is possible to deduce from them not only that Euripides had no genuine belief in the 'anthropomorphic deities of the Olym- pian tradition', but that he was a 'semi-pantheist', he concludes that the plays are deliberately intended as not merely fictions but impossible fictions or 'fan- tasies'. '"The stories I put before you", Euripides in effect says to his audience and his readers, "cannot be true; for they imply that the gods are such beings, and do such actions, as no right-minded and sensible man can think possible. None the less, tradition represents the gods as such beings, and as acting thus; and if you can and will believe tradition in this matter, there is no reason why you should find my plots impossible or even improbable. But even if you cannot or will not believe tradition, there is a quite definite element of possibility and even probability in these plots. I am showing you what, if tradition were</page><page sequence="2">44 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW trustworthy, if the gods were like that, might have happened or even must have happened. For my human personages, I will venture to claim, are more real, they behave more naturally, than those of other tragic poets." ' After expounding his own view in general terms, Mr. Greenwood devotes two chapters to careful examination of what he calls 'the symbolist theory' (represented by Grube's essay 'Dionysus in the Bacchae', Tr. Am. Phil. Ass. 1935), with particular reference to the Hippolytus and Bacchae, and 'the rationalist theory' (Verrall), with special reference to the Heracles. Then since the Supplices offers special difficulties for his theory he gives his own interpretation of this play at length, and concludes with a chapter intended to support the theory indirectly by arguing that Greek tragedy, being unrealistic, could the more easily admit elements of satire extraneous to its human aspects. Mr. Greenwood's theory is less unplausible than it may at first sight appear. He asks us in effect to believe that Euripides' attitude to his plays was like that of a modern reader, who has no belief in Olympian gods but accepts the actions and passions of the human characters as moving and true to life. Even the modern reader, however, cannot fail to feel that, for example, Aphrodite and Artemis in the Hippolytus stand, in some sense, for real impulses or passions, which perhaps were still more real in Euripidean Athens. Mr. Greenwood will not have this 'symbolist' opinion, partly because he thinks Euripides regards mortals as 'responsible beings who can, if we will, choose the right and refuse the wrong' and who cannot be at the mercy of unreasonable gods; partly because he thinks it incredible that Euripides should personify the forces of nature as submen and not as supermen; and partly because no similar inter- pretation can be offered for Poseidon's part in the play. The first two grounds carry little conviction, and with regard to the third it must be said that the Greek gods were diverse in origin and character and are naturally so treated by Euripides. Indeed not only is the whole case for Euripides' 'semi-pantheism' built on a very slender base, but the views of others besides Mr. Greenwood who use it, or something like it, to discount Euripides' belief in the Olympian gods seem to neglect a necessary distinction between myth and religion. There is no reason to deny that Euripides participated in any Athenian cults when Socrates and Plato, more radical critics than he, and the former probably the source of some of Euripides' own criticisms, certainly did so. One concrete illustration (illustration only, for each play has its own prob- lems). Mr. Greenwood holds that Euripides' attitude to Hera in the Heracles is that 'she deserves no reverence or worship, and therefore not only is she not mighty, but she is not there at all'. But what if Heracles owes all his ennoble- ment to Hera's persecution and his labours? And what if his infinitely moving refusal to be ashamed of his a-iaTELvd'r was reached only through the grim catastrophe of the play, and his famous lines beginning Eyc'7 7 ro0 s eozs ovT AK7rp" eq O'S (Io I'UTPYELV voLw) not an undramatic intrusion of Euripides' own views but Heracles' intuition that the gods' actions may not be what they seem? Mr. Greenwood's approach to all the plays is rationalist; and for all his persuasiveness it is not easy to believe that a theory or formula can contain either the baffling and often contradictory phenomena of Greek polytheism (in which Euripides is deeply involved) or the subtlety, waywardness, and power of the poet's imagination.
