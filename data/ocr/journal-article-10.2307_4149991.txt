<plain_text><page sequence="1">arti-facts edited by Benjamin W Porter A Late Bronze Age Cultic Installation at Tall a -lUmayri, Jordan ot many architectural ruins have been discovered that date to the famously underrepresented Late. Bronze Age (1600-1200 BCE) in the highlands of Jordan. This is particularly so south of the Zarqa River in the central and southen Transiordanian highlands where settlement had declined and the extant popuklation, it has been frequently argued, assumed a largely nomadic way of life. Glueck's synthesis, which saw most of Jordan as a "camping ground for tent dwellers" (1940:114), has recently been modified to admit to some urban representation (Sauer 1986; McGovern 1992; Strange 2001), but coherent plans of Late Bronze structures are nevertheless largely absent. So the excavation over the past five years of a Late Bronze Age monumental building at (Umayri (located about fifteen kilometers south of (Amman, Jordan) is of particular importance. Archaeologists excavated two small rooms (twenty-five square meter combined area) to floor level during the 2000 and 2002 seasons, and doorways and exposed wall lines suggested the building had more rooms to be uncovered. Recent excavations have verified their presence. Five rooms of the building have now been exposed in part or whole with walls of semi-hewn stones still standing to a height of two to two and a half or more meters. The ongoing excavations at (Umayri are being conducted by the Madaba Plains Project, which is sponsored by La Sierra University in consortium with Walla Walla College, Canadian University College, Pacific Union College and Jordan's Department of Antiquities. The 2004 season conducted this July and August revealed a cultic installation in the largest known room of the complex. This three and a half by eight meter broad room featured a 1.2-meter-thick mudbrick wall on its west side (the side opposite the room's door). Constructed into this wall was a stepped cult niche (1.5 meters wide by 0.8 meters deep) that faces into the room. The mudbrick wall separated the broad room from a small trapezoidal room formed by the space between the mudbrick wall and an outer pre-existing wall running along the crest of (Umayri's Middle Bronze Age rampart. However, the excavators are unsure of the wall's height; it could have functioned as a curtain wall separating the main room from the adjunct, posterior room. Mounted in the center of the niche was one principal standing stone about a meter in height (though partially embedded in plaster), which was flanked by four additional stones, two on each side. The mudbrick recess had been plastered with a very thin lime whitewash over the mudbrick sides and the five standing stones had been secured into position with a thick white lime-based plaster at the back and on the horizontal surface area of the niche. Associated vessels were positioned on a plaster shelf constructed over the right-hand flanking stones and on the step. Lamps, a chalice, two carinated bowls (one nearly miniature), and an unfired clay figurine constituted the assemblage. The crudely-formed clay figurine was identical to approximately fifteen partially preserved figurines found the previous season in the trapezoidal chamber behind the shrine along with a goblet and two juglets. This suggests that the small room served as a storage room or repository for the service of the cultic installation. The four standing stones are intriguing for their peculiar shapes. From left to right, the first is circular while the next seems to resemble a bare foot (as several excavation participants independently noted). Then to the right of the large central stone is a stone with a broken surface layer perhaps suggesting the profile or silhouette of a rather Washingtonesque head. Finally, on the right is what we call a "complex chert nodule." The chert nodule is natural but appears to be contoured with squiggly lines (not unlike viscera) and eyes. Two of the "eyes" have a center area chipped off thereby removing the opaque cortex of the chert and creating the semblance of a translucent pupil for each eye. The "eye" end was oriented up and forward, and plaster held it securely in place. Alternatively, the two "eyes" may have represented breasts with the familiar fertility associations seen in the ubiquitous female figurines found in many archaeological periods. Here the overall anthropomorphic aspect The Late Bronze Age cultic niche found this summer at Tall al-'Umayri. Four smaller standing stones and cultic pottery in the one and a half meters wide niche flank a one-meter tall standing stone. The niche itself is constructed in a mudbrick wall that is part of a multi-roomed stone-built building. 50 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:1 (2004)</page><page sequence="2">is less clear because of the natural formation of the object. This would be phenomenally analogous to the presence in the Egyptian temple at Timna of votive gifts of Venus-shaped haematite nodules (Rothenberg 1988: 268 pl. 155). These small associated stones must have been considered somehow portentous, propitious, or otherwise crossing over from the world of the divine; once discovered, they were likely brought to (Umayri to become part of the cultic installation. However, they appear to be more than votive items because of their integrated inclusion into the structure of the shrine. The large, central standing stone (made of limestone) is finely shaped and symmetrical, and may have been ground and smoothed, although no obvious indications of manual working have been detected. The attendant vessels were not all complete; for instance, the chalice's flared rim above the carination appears to have been broken off in antiquity and not present at the time of the building's destruction. However, this does not seem to have ended their service in the cult. The designation of the whole building structure with attendant cult niche is a difficult one. It appears to have been a carefully planned building. All the interior walls are one meter in width, oriented at crisp parallel and perpendicular angles, and the three known internal doorways are each 1.1 to 1.2 meters wide. The outer walls were compromised slightly by fitting the plan into a pre-existing space crowded in the southwest by a Middle Bronze Age wall and utilizing in the west and north the Middle Bronze or Late Bronze Age wall running along the Middle Bronze Age rampart crest. The walls of the large room were clearly plastered over with a thick mud plaster that was extensively preserved on the south wall of that room and to a lesser extent elsewhere. Traces were detected in one of the southern rooms as well. The cult niche and the mudbrick wall are part of the largest room and the niche faces the door dominating the view from the mostly unexcavated fifth room in the northeast, likely the entry or antechamber. The building is clearly not a domestic structure. Compared to other buildings at (Umayri, the semi-hewn stones (many resembling bricks) used to build its walls are unique; the care in, and uniformity of, the dimensions suggest a design and organized execution not often seen with opportunistic and practical domestic buildings; the height of this building with its stone walls preserved to nearly three meters and filled with fallen mudbricks, some of which hardened in the fiery destruction, indicate even higher walls or an upper story that exceeds practical needs and implies a monumental function. But is the building a temple with an irregular floor plan as is attested at several other sites from the Late Bronze Age? Is it a "palace" with a cultic installation (and function?) dominating the major room? Or is it a multifunctional monumental building that incorporated several dimensions of ancient life, religion and administration? Future excavation will no doubt help answer these questions. Archaeologists did not reach the floor of the major room and a balk crosses through the room's northern end. Also, the fifth room may reveal entry architecture A crude, unfired clay figurine had been placed on the step near the ceramic vessels. It resembled in construction style and material several partial figurines found in the trapezoidal room behind the niche. Punctilear eyes and ears and incised mouth are imposed on a finger-modeled head and torso with the fingerprints still clearly visible. One of the small stones plastered into the niche exhibited unusual natural surface features. The untooled chert nodule may have been esteemed because the features suggested anthropomorphic characteristics. An attitude of reverence or awe for the find possibly led to the inclusion of this object as a permanent part of the shrine. that would be of help in understanding the building. Regardless, this installation and its associated components constitute a rare and fascinating example of cultic architecture from the Late Bronze Age in the Transjordanian Highlands.
