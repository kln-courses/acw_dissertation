<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Editor: Martin H. Levinson, PhD Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity. New York: Schocken, 2009. Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677), a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese origin, is considered one of the great rationalists of seventeenth-century philosophy, laying the groundwork for the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism. By virtue of his magnum opus, the posthumous Ethics, in which he opposed Descartes' mind-body dualism, Spinoza is considered to be one of Western philosophy's most important philosophers. Philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Frederich Hegel said of all modern philosophers, "You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all." In Betraying Spinoza, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein links historical infor- mation about Spinoza and his times with her own personal story about how she came to view him as the linchpin philosopher whose lonely choice to think out the world for himself has enabled people living today to take for granted the importance of reason as the key element in human progress. Specific topics covered in the book include Spinoza's pioneering advocacy of complete freedom of thought in religious matters; his excommunication from the Jewish community; the fateful events in Amsterdam in the closing years of Spinoza's life; the philosophical developments of the seventeenth century; and Spinoza's idea of a philosophical religion completely purged of all anthropomorphism. Goldstein interweaves all these themes, and many oth- ers, to provide the reader with a greater understanding of Spinoza as a human being who desired to "save the world" through the power of rational thought. The book also contains a chronology spanning key historical events that starts in 71 1 with the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Spain and ends in 1689 when John Locke published his "Letter of Tolerance," a defense of reli- gious liberty. I found the listing quite useful in providing historical context for the development of Spinoza's ideas. Martin H. Levinson, PhD 121</page></plain_text>
