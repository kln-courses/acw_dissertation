<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI* Technology at a crossroads: The Fifth Generation  Computer Project in Japan IN EXPLAINING THE development of technology in a particular country, two  approaches have been predominant. One approach bases analysis on the unique,  local situations in the country and the particular cultural values there. The other  approach assumes that we can transcend and explain a country’s choice of tech- nology in universal, generally applicable terms. As one surveys the literature, it  is apparent that historians, notably Western historians, apply the two approaches  simltaneously. While respecting the very different cultures found in each of the  various countries in “The West,” Western historians tend, nonetheless, to treat Euro- American technology as if it were a universal category, and they display little sense  of discomfort with this juxtaposition. Western scholars studying a technology in a  non-Western country, however, usually lean heavily on the first approach, tending  to focus on local uniqueness. In the case of Japan, whether the subject is science and technology, sociology,  political science, or economics, specialists routinely look for uniquely Japanese  factors or sensibilities. Especially when dealing with developments since the Meiji  period (after Japan opened to the West in 1853), analysts tend to dwell on culture- bound decision-making processes, methods of consensus formation, management  style, vertical social organization, paternalistic traditions, and seniority-oriented  structures. Studies often culminate in an image of a robotic economic animal or a  corporate Japan Inc. The accent is on differences rather than on similarities with  Western counterparts. One is led to conclude that there is, first and foremost, a unique  Japanese identity, and that Japan and the Japanese function in a distinct manner.  *Faculty of International Studies, Bunkyo University, 1100 Namegaya, Chigasaki 253,  Japan; koizumi@shonan.bunkyo.ac.jp.

In the following  pages, I highlight the second, general approach. My topic concerns electronic data- processing computers and Japan’s attempt to launch a totally new Fifth Generation  Computer Project (FGCP) in the early 1980s. I will address universal, globally  recognized values as they impacted technology choice in the FGCP in Japan. From the late 1970s until the late 1980s relations between Japan and the U.S.  were uneasy in high-technology fields, especially in the area of computers. In this  area, largely as a result of software, Japanese computer manufacturers were locked  into replicating U.S. computer technology. Notwithstanding this dependence, the  U.S. accused Japan of spying on U.S. computer firms and stealing their trade se- crets. More broadly, the U.S. also complained that the Japanese government gave  subsidies to the computer industry and to other private-sector markets, and that  Japan set up both tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. The U.S. tried to reverse what  it considered pernicious trade imbalances, but Japanese industry continued to gain  over U.S. competitors in steel, electronics, and automobiles. U.S. workers who lost  jobs in this economic climate expressed their anger before worldwide TV cameras  by publicly smashing Japanese electronics products and Japanese automobiles. This kind of public outburst fueled anti-Japanese sentiment. International  tensions ran high. In the late 1980s “the Japan problem” came to a head. People  in the U.S. accused Japan of harboring “special economic rules’’; they contended  that U.S. economic rules were right and that Japanese rules were wrong and unfair.  “Japan bashing” became a household phrase in both Japan and the U.S. Japan undertook its ambitious Fifth Generation Computer Project in the 1980s  during this difficult period between Japan and the U.S. There is clear evidence  that the Japanese planners viewed their project as having more than technological  implications. They saw it as a positive step in the creation of a new international  relationship for Japan with the West, indeed with the whole world. Planners considered two approaches for meeting computer needs in the 1990s.  The approaches related to the technical side of computer architecture. One could  seek to create an unprecedented new computer with non-Von Neumann architecture,  or one could focus on a mixture of standard and non-Von Neumann architectural  features. The planners, however, failed to reach a consensus on which approach  to choose by technical arguments alone. The present paper discusses how they  made their ultimate choice, and it analyzes their project in terms of two non-local  cultural values, ‘‘originality’’ and ‘‘fairness.’’ I hope to show that these values  played an important role in the technology choice. I also want to draw attention to  the importance of examining global cultural values and their role in the develop- ment of technology across international borders. My goal is to provide a deeper  1.

THE FIFTH GENERATION COMPUTER PROJECT The setting Japanese manufacturers began their efforts to produce computers in the late  1950s. In spite of strenuous endeavors, however, they remained aware of an enor- mous technological gap separating them from the U.S., particularly when IBM’s  System/360 came out in 1964. Assertive policy measures related to computers taken  by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI, now called the Ministry  of Economy, Trade, and Industry) allowed Japan to catch up with the U.S. in the  manufacture of hardware, but software remained a huge problem, especially in the  overseas market, where Japanese-manufactured computers had to be able to use  IBM products. The requirement of IBM-compatibility forced computer producers  to abandon their hopes for creating original hardware. Thus Fujitsu and Hitachi,  two companies that depended on the export market, had no choice but to replicate  IBM machines.2 The narrow limits of manufacturing viability made Japanese manufacturers  vulnerable to criticism about unfair trade practices. The U.S. criticisms were explicit  and severe, and the Japanese mass media reported on them almost daily. Specifi- cally, the U.S. complained that while high-quality Japanese industrial products  such as automobiles, televisions, video-cassette recorders, and other electronic  appliances had been flooding into the U.S. market, Japan protected its own domes- tic markets with barriers against U.S. goods and services; at the same time Japan  provided government subsidies to the private sector for developing sophisticated  products to compete against U.S. goods. A recurring motif, both patronizing and  angry, was the accusation that these high-tech products had originated in the U.S.  and that Japan had merely copied them—that is to say, Japan was just applying  the results of basic research done elsewhere to develop new products for the world  markets. In the view of the U.S., Japan was ‘‘a free rider’’ on the conveyance of  basic research done in the U.S. Two examples illustrate the controversy. First, as competition between Japan  and the U.S. heated up in the area of semiconductors, U.S. journalists introduced the  expression ‘‘semiconductor war.’’ In 1978, Fortune magazine published an article,  “The Japanese spies in Silicon Valley,” under a cover caricaturing Japanese busi- nessmen spying with binoculars.3 Second, when Japan announced their launching  of the Fifth Generation Computer Project, angry and contemptuous voices arose  among U.S. computer specialists. An MIT professor remarked that if the Japanese  2. Johoshori gakkai rekishi tokubetsu iinkai, Nihon no konpuuta hattatsushi [Evolution of  the Japanese computer industry], (Kyoto, 1998), 79–84.  3.

In this context it meant a  computer not using Von Neumann architecture, which was and remains the industry  standard. Von Neumann architecture has two main features: a stored program and  serial processing. Instructions and data are stored together in the computer’s main  memory and emerge as needed through one channel to enter the Central Process- ing Unit (CPU); following their use, they return to storage. Since there is only one  channel and processing takes place sequentially, this computer architecture sustains  a queueing problem known as the Von Neumann bottleneck.  Von Neumann architecture, therefore, came to rely on software to compensate  for the weakness of its hardware design. Compensation by software seemed a natural  corrective for early computer hardware. Notwithstanding substantial improvements  in hardware, for example in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), computer archi- tecture has remained unchanged, with the result that the role of software has only  become larger and more complex. For this reason, calls have been made for a new,  basic computer architecture to compensate for flaws in software programs.5 In a classification current around 1980, computers were ordered by hardware  generations. Computers made with vacuum tubes constituted the first generation;  those made with transistors, the second generation; machines using integrated  circuits (IC), the third generation. The computers built while the hardware was  moving to VLSI constituted the 3.5 generation, and those fully incorporating VLSI  were one day to be called the fourth generation.6 It was anticipated that a fifth  generation computer would appear, perhaps sometime in the 1990s, but there was  no consensus about what it would be like or what it could do. A MITI civil servant, Masataka Nakano, was responsible for setting a new  goal upon completion of MITI’s VLSI project, about to end successfully in 1979.  He first proposed the idea of creating a completely new computer. Because the  Japanese lagged far behind the U.S. in computer software, a successor project  was likely to focus either on innovative software or on a completely new computer  unrelated to Von Neumann architecture that would be a so-called fifth generation  computer. Not a computer specialist himself, Nakano had to consult with those  who were, but first he commissioned a background study by asking the Japan  Electronic Computer Company (JECC) to undertake a global review on behalf of  4.

Little, a U.S. consulting firm, to conduct  a general survey on future world trends in computers. Questionnaires included a  query on whether a computer constructed with a non-Von Neumann architecture  was conceivable in the near future.  Nakano took his report to Kazuhiro Fuchi, then a section chief at MITI’s Com- prehensive Research Institute for Electronics Technology (Denshi Gijutsu Sogo  Kenkyusho, known as Densoken). This institute, now called the National Institute  of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, was at the time Japan’s computer  research mecca. A specialist on voice recognition and inference mechanisms, Fuchi  was a strong advocate of attempting to develop a non-Von Neumann architecture  for computing. Following conversations between Nakano and Fuchi, a small group  formed to study its feasibility.  The group took shape in 1978. The following year, the group enlarged into the  Survey and Research Committee on a Fifth Generation Computer. This committee  eventually divided into three research subcommittees: Computer Architecture, Basic  Computer Theory, and Social Conditions and the Environment. This last subcom- mittee had the task of anticipating the nature of society and its needs in the 1990s.  Ultimately more than 100 specialists from universities, public research institutes,  and computer manufacture firms took part in these discussions, and more than 100  meetings were held over two years before work concluded in 1981. The Computer Architecture Subcommittee was reluctant to question Von  Neumann architecture. The Basic Theory Subcommittee was bolder, challenging  the traditional architecture and looking into new possibilities. Headed by Fuchi,  with core members from Densoken, this subcommittee wanted to try out a new  computer language called PROLOG. They were less concerned with the process- ing of data (the only capability of computers then) than with the processing of  knowledge. Using PROLOG and exploring inference mechanisms, they thought  they could generate new knowledge. If they succeeded, they would have invented a  completely new kind of computer. Their success would mean the end of all software  then in use, which would bring strong opposition from computer manufacturers  and users around the world.  Seeking to develop such an “original’’ computer would be a huge gamble.  Nonetheless it was clear to Japanese computer specialists that if they stuck to  conventional approaches, there would be no escape from dependency on IBM.  They had come to a crossroads: Commit to the conventional architecture or try a  radically new approach.7 In March 1981, after two years of study by its three subcommittees, the Fifth  Generation Computer Committee issued its final report: Report on the survey and  research on a fifth generation computer (hereafter Report). It identified five social  7.

One dinner at a hotel costs more than four calculators, the  result of low productivity in the service sector and high productivity in the industrial  sector. This imbalance, if left unrectified, would cause problems in other sectors  of society over the coming decades. The introduction of a new type of computer  into low productivity sectors would help the situation.  The Report further pointed out that computers were designed to deal mainly  with numerical data, but that they were limited in such areas as natural languages,  photographs, figures, sounds, and especially knowledge in general. It stressed that  computers in the 1990s had to expand into these new domains. It also addressed  the so-called “software crisis,” where, forced to compensate for poorly designed  hardware and responsible for many tasks, programs had become extremely large,  numerous, and complex. Without fundamental changes, this situation would even- tually precipitate disaster. The Report stressed the importance of a user-friendly  computer. Instead of forcing humans to become more compatible with comput- ers, the designers should make computers more accessible to people. With such  arguments the committee justified the need for a Fifth Generation Computer, but  it offered no details about the path to follow. Notably, it offered no opinon about  Von Neumann architecture. The Report listed emerging technologies that could contribute to the creation of  the new computer. It predicted that rapid technical development, like the transition  from Large Scale Integration (LSI) to VLSI over the past decade, could be expected  to continue. Already available or expected soon, were also high-speed devices and  technologies adapted from communications, parallel processing technologies such  as single instruction multi-data streams, and artificial intelligence.9 The Report  gave a strong impression that the time was ripe for Japan to commit to developing  a completely new computer.  The choice The summary reports of the Basic Theory Subcommittee and Architecture  Subcommittee, revealed a tension over the meaning of “a new computer.” The Basic  Theory Subcommittee was speculative and bold; the Architecture Subcommittee  was technical and prudent. The theorists considered the Von Neumann architecture  8.

They recognized that with the rapid development of VLSI technology  and employment of the basic software theories developed in the 1970s, a new  computer could be within reach. A new machine had to deal with natural languages  and knowledge, yet to do so would require a quantum leap in basic thinking. The  subcommittee’s proposal led with the word “bold.” It specified that the aim should  be to make a ‘‘knowledge processor.’’10 The Architecture Subcommittee, on the  other hand, felt that the problems confronting computers were so diverse that more  than one kind of innovation would be required. It proposed creating three different  kinds of machines with three different architectures. A computer based on a com- pletely new non-Von Neumann architecture could coexist with computers based on  improvements in existing architecture. In short, the subcommittee recommended  developing both revolutionary and evolutionary machines.11 The Survey and Research Committee on a Fifth Generation Computer left the  conflicting conclusions of the two subcommittees stand untouched in its final report.  It issued a Proposal for research and development of a fifth generation computer  bearing the same date as the Report (March 1981). The Proposal did not mention  the conflicting opinions in the Report nor did it describe how the Architecture Com- mittee must have given in to the Basic Theory Committee’s view. The Proposal  simply outlined plans for developing a totally new computer that would be able  to understand problems given it by the user, to model and write programs for the  user on its own, and to remain user friendly at all times.12 What dynamics were at work behind the scenes to resolve two different  approaches to creating a new computer for the 1990s? How did they rectify the  obvious differences that appear in the Report? Was persuasion achieved merely  through technical discussions? Did they establish technical criteria by which to  judge which approach was superior? Or did some other criteria from outside the  computer field play a role? Two documents hint at what happened to break the  opposition of the Architecture Subcommittee. One is a keynote speech by Fuchi,  who chaired the Basic Theory Subcommittee and later headed the actual project,  which started officially in 1981. In this speech he observed that they had come to  10. Ibid., 58. For those interested in the local cultural differences approach, I might mention  one that is wide open awaiting examination. The Japanese love affair with robotics and  robots has often been noted. The widely expressed sentiment that a natural continuum  exists between humans and robots, anthropomorphic attitudes toward robots, the keeping of  robots as pets, etc. reflect a phenomenon easily observed in Japan. It may not be unrelated  to another continuum repeatedly remarked upon: that there exists in Japan a sense of  continuum between humans and the surrounding natural world not found in certain other  societies. It is not impossible to see in Fuchi’s attitude toward the FGCP a belief in the  possibility of a computer that would function just as the human brain and heart do in both  processing as well as generating knowledge.  11.

Perhaps the reasons  were too involved to be given in a lecture. The other document, by Junichiro Kamimae, a journalist reporting on the  FGCP, gives Tatsu Motooka, an authority on computer architecture and professor  of the University of Tokyo, the decisive voice. Motooka was the chairman of the  Survey and Research Committee on a Fifth Generation Computer. Initially unde- cided between the two alternatives, he started to lean toward an unconventional  approach as early as the fall of 1980. Kamimae writes that Motooka indicated to  Fuchi at that time that he was willing to pursue the project in Fuchi’s direction.  Kamimae further reported on an earlier conversation between a high-ranking of- ficial at MITI and Motooka. The official had remarked that whether the project was  pursued in a conventional or unconventional way, it would be a gamble. Until that  conversation, Motooka had not thought of the project as a gamble, but if, indeed,  it was a gamble either way, he preferred to bet on Fuchi’s enthusiasm.14 Fuchi  frequently used the expression “a new technology framework” when referring to  his revolutionary (non-Von Neumann) approach. He believed that the government  should support such major future-oriented projects like the FGCP because they  were beyond the capacity of private companies.15 These reported conversations  suggest that rather than technical considerations, non-technical criteria ultimately  persuaded the members of the Committee. Other circumstantial evidence supports this conclusion. It would be natural to  expect the committee to evaluate each technological approach (a revolutionary ma- chine or an evolutionary one) against the five social needs it identified at the outset  of the Report. Surprisingly, however, there is no discussion of this kind in either  the Report or the Proposal. Again, instead of explaining the technical nature of the  FGCP, the Report speaks only of non-technical characteristics that the project should  manifest: It should be pioneering, creative, and in the longterm, international, so  that it could advance Japan’s position in the world. Further, the Report’s rhetoric is  often anything but technical. It states that, in view of its longterm nature, the FGCP  will range from basic to applied research, but the focus must be on ambitious basic  research within fiscal reason.16 The Basic Theory Subcommittee had seasoned its  summary report with words and phrases like ‘‘hunch,’’ ‘‘hypothesis,’’ ‘‘quantum  leap in basic thinking,’’ and ‘‘daring proposal.’’ They suggest that so huge a gap in  13.

A final non-technical factor was that this project was to be carried out within a  government ministry, MITI. It was a MITI official, Nakano, who first approached  Fuchi with the idea of a non-Von Neumann machine, and many MITI officials  opposed coupling Japan indefinitely and submissively to the IBM locomotive.  MITI wanted Japan to be able to use fifth generation computer technology to prove  that Japan was no mere imitator of U.S. computer technology.17 Here we come to  perhaps the most significant non-technical criterion invoked to end the impasse in  the Committee: the non-local cultural value, “originality.” 2. CULTURAL VALUES Merely reassembling old ingredients would not have qualified as ‘‘originality,’’  nor would it have overcome prejudice and elicited American applause. For Japan,  originality lay in producing a machine that no one else had thought to develop. It  would certainly win international recognition and bargaining power. ‘‘Originality’’  for the Japanese meant what it had to mean globally, a quantum leap in basic think- ing, a pioneering, creative, longterm, international and daring proposal. This is a  non-local meaning of ‘‘originality.’’ Using it the committee chose the revolutionary  ‘‘non-Von Neumann’’ approach.  Technology is usually referred to as a means to achieve an end, but here technol- ogy extends more generally. In producing a means, an end was sought beyond the  obvious technical target. The Japanese sought not just a new computer capable of  solving problems anticipated for the 1990s. They sought one anchored in a notion  of originality that would yield not just technological capability and power but also  industrial, political, and cultural power, one that would bring international respect.  This is the line of reasoning that prevailed at the crossroads.  Implementation The non-local cultural value “fairness” was also at work, and it played a major  role in determining implementation of the new computer project. Because Japan  had been subjected to foreign attacks on the issue of “fairness,” the Committee  deemed it absolutely necessary that the new revolutionary computer be produced in  an open atmosphere, in neither technological nor industrial secrecy. Both the Report  and the Proposal of March 1981 were issued immediately in English translation  and sent to computer experts overseas. At the same time, the committee announced  that the first international conference devoted exclusively to a future generation  computer, FGCS (Fifth Generation Computer System), would be held in Japan  that fall. At the conference they formally and publicly declared their intention to  17. Okada (ref. 5), 69–71.

Given that the Japanese government would pay all costs,  it was a national project, but one where some of the research would be conducted  jointly with foreign countries and in an international spirit.18 The first FGCS conference was successful. The Japanese Diet approved a  budget for the Fifth Generation Computer Project in April 1982. MITI set up the  Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, known as ICOT, to carry out  the project. But in June, just as ICOT was beginning its official activities, there  came news that two Japanese computer specialists had been arrested in Santa Clara,  California by the FBI for allegedly trying to obtain IBM documents illegally. The  incident was widely reported in the Japanese mass media with photos of the men  with their wrists handcuffed behind their backs. The arrests shocked not only Japa- nese specialists in the field, but also ordinary Japanese citizens. It was one thing to  manufacture computers that replicated IBM technology, but quite another to obtain  documents illegally. The people arrested explained that the motive for their crime  was the U.S. marketing of a new IBM 3081K in November 1981. At the earliest  there would be a delay of a year and a half before IBM would make its principles  of operation available to the public. In the face of intense market competition in  computer manufacturing, and given the Japanese industry’s dependence on IBM  compatibility, the accused felt they had had no choice; waiting 18 months would  have destroyed their company.19 Since the IBM spies had no relation to ICOT, there was no direct impact on  the project. But there was an indirect effect. When ICOT began work, it had a  ten-year mandate, but its budget was initially approved only for two years. Theo- retically, after two years it could have ended. Yet not only did the project produce  interesting and promising results during those two years, but also, because of the  IBM Spy Incident, it accentuated the need for Japanese computer manufacturers  to extricate themselves from IBM dependency, and the need for a completely new  computer more obvious.20 Not only was the new ICOT computer project refunded  yearly after that, but its lifetime was extended to eleven years.  Japan made strenuous efforts to show that the ICOT project was truly open  and international. In addition to the first international FGCS conference in 1981,  three more took place, in 1984, 1988, and 1992. Other endeavors to publicize the  international aspects of the project included symposia with different countries  such as Sweden, Italy, France, the U.S., and UK. Furthermore, joint research was  initiated with institutions outside Japan, such as the Argonne National Laboratory,  the National Institute of Health (U.S.), the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the  Swedish Institute of Computer Science, and the Australian National University.  Publications such as ICOT technical reports, and Technical memorandums, went  18. The Report (ref. 8), 37. 19.

It has received various evaluations  ranging from failure to success. Fuchi himself declared the project a 60–70 percent  success. It created an “original” computer that circumvented Von Neumann’s single  channel bottleneck by providing multiple parallel, simultaneously accessible chan- nels. Yet it fell far short of imitating the way the human brain accesses and processes  knowledge, which had been Fuchi’s dream. The “original” non-Von Neumann  computer created by this project faded from world consciousness in the face of  overwhelming momentum in the high-speed computer industry. Today, no one in  the U.S., Japan, or elsewhere even speaks of computers in terms of generations. 3. CONCLUSION Irrespective of the outcome, Fuchi’s FGCP reveals the dynamics at work when  technologists reach a crossroads. This case illustrates important factors in the nature  of technology choice. We may benefit further by juxtaposing it with several Western  studies on technology in American contexts. Reading Edward Constant’s analysis of the Texas oil industry,22 one gets the  strong impression that technology is like a ship tossing in a turbulent political,  economic, cultural, and social sea, rudderless, with no idea where it is heading,  despite efforts of the crew to steer it in a preferred direction. Eric Schatzberg’s  study of the aircraft industry reveals that metal almost completely replaced wood  in plane construction between the two world wars. He analyzes this as a case of  “the technical indeterminacy of the choice between wood and metal” (where no  proof is available of the superiority of one over the other), and finds that at the  moment of choice the impasse is overcome by the cultural value “progress” that  was embraced by aircraft engineers.23 Since the Enlightenment, metal had been  associated with progress and thus itself became a symbol representing progress.  That symbol, more than technological considerations, tipped the scale.24 It may  be questioned whether “progress” is a globally admired value. But the aircraft  engineers embraced this value for cultural reasons and did not choose it, as Fuchi  had chosen “originality,” to affect international relations. Donald MacKenzie also discusses two examples where cultural values impacted  “technical indeterminacy” or “contingency of design,” in short, where viable options  for technology choice existed and a choice was made for cultural, non-technical  21.

It is a clear case of local American culture-bound  values at the core of a choice. Technological contingency gave Robert Moses, the  designer of the overpasses, the power to exercise his social prejudice. As a result  of his design, the poor, who could not afford to own cars, were denied access to  the beaches because Moses designed the overpasses very low, so that public buses  could not use the parkways. MacKenzie’s second example is David Noble’s analysis  of the choice made by the management of an American factory between the use  of expert-required record-playback or numerical-control machine tools. Here, too,  technological contingency allowed management a choice based on non-technical  factors such as economics, or labor control. Although such factors may seem to  reflect universals, they really depended on particular circumstances and attitudes  within the local factory. With numerical-control machine tools, unskilled workers  could be introduced to the factory floor, reducing costs and giving management  more power there.  In the case of the Fifth Generation Computer Project contingency gave com- puter engineers control over fundamental decisions. They could make decisions  based on their own opinions, rather than the views of corporate management or  government. This independence of action occurred here for the first time in the  computer industry in Japan. Because of technical indeterminacy or contingency  of design, the engineers had the chance to contemplate different possible technical  approaches freely. They could choose either to follow the established IBM path  or break away from it and create a new computer. With no technological proofs,  the choice they made was the uncharted path. Fuchi was determined not to allow  Japanese predilections or local cultural values to interfere with this choice. He chose  instead to embrace the values “originality” and “fairness,” which were globally  recognized and respected. In so doing, he believed he would be able to establish a  whole new relationship for Japan’s interaction with the rest of the world.  25.

Until that juncture, Japan had simply followed  paths laid out by the West in the areas of science and technology. The FGCP, how- ever, represented a historical moment as Japanese engineers attempted to extricate  themselves from untenable constraints while presenting reputable achievements to  the world at large. In designing the Fifth Generation Computer, Japanese engineers  found themselves split between two tenable concepts: a revolutionary new computer  of non-Von Neumann architecture or an evolutionary computer that combined  Von Neumann with non-Von Neumann elements. At a crossroads, unable to prove  to each other the technological superiority of one over the other, they made their  decision to take the revolutionary path on the basis of non-technical factors: the  universal cultural values “originality” and “fairness.” This paper will argue that in  contrast to the importance often given to unique, local, culture-bound values when  dealing with non-Western case studies, the Japanese engineers deliberately chose  universally recognized cultural values to resolve their technological impasse. The  choice was made not only to advance computer technology, but essentially to gain  indisputable distinction and to establish a new and fresh technological relationship  with the Western World.
