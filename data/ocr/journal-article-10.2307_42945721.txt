<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nancy Lane From Saint-Hilaire to Martinville and Beyond: Self, Desire, and Writing in Remembrance of Things Past * I. Introduction The landscape of Proust's novel is marked throughout by a series of spires, steeples, and towers that together form a set of powerful metaphors for the relation between subject and object, for the divided self, and for the complex dynamics of desire and the act of writing. Generating the narrative and un- derlying the thematics of the novel is the tension between an empirical, ex- periencing self and a transcendental self. In Kantian terms, the empirical self is the introspective self, knowable and known, aware of itself and perceiving itself as object, located in time. The "I" who speaks in the novel is a series of empirical selves, each perceiving the objects, characters, impressions, and events that constitute the narrative. None of these "I" 's (including the narrator) is extratemporal, capable of achieving any integration or communication among the "airtight compartments" of the series of empirical selves. Opposed to the empirical self in Kant's epistemological model is the transcendental self, the self of pure apperception, thinkable but unknowable (Körner 66-68). In Proust's novel, the transcendental self is the self who writes (the "je scripteur"), not to be confused with the narrator (the voice that says "I"). Proust's text elaborates this Kantian epistemology, weaving in another concept from German Idealism: Schopenhauer's notion of the will. Anne Henry has ably demonstrated that the Proustian dichotomy of the self owes a great deal to Schopenhauer. For Schopenhauer, she points out, "The only way of escaping the limitations of the individual will was ... to rise up to contem- plation of the universal Will, a contemplation achieved not by abstract re- duction but by forgetting the particular contents and the struggles of con- sciousness, through a qualitative intuition that allows us to coincide with the deepest essence of a world that is itself movement and feeling" (49; my trans- lation). The questing empirical self in Proust's novel is limited. It seeks a higher, deeper knowledge of the world based on intuition and is destined at every turn to be deceived by sense impressions. The transcendental self, on * Part of this article has appeared in slightly different form in Romance Notes 27 (Autumn 1986): 45-5 1 . 1 am deeply indebted to Professor Edouard Morot-Sir for his many insightful and helpful comments on the earlier paper.

The height of the spires in the novel becomes the metaphor for richness and insight. Only when viewed from above does the repetition which would otherwise be tedium acquire depth and meaning; the view from the spires is privileged.' While the many spires, towers, and steeples serve as objects of perception for the empirical self, they at the same time posit the concept of a transcendental subject. Yet the relation between object and subject is one of identity as well as difference. In a rewriting of Schopenhauer's model of perception, the Proustian subject can know the world truly only by merging with it. The "real" is opaque, impenetrable because perceived through our senses; only through intuition (aesthetic perception) can the subject finally merge with and grasp those "im- material sections, things, that is, which one's soul can assimilate" (1: 91). In the long quest for "the ultimate conquest of truth," the Proustian subject is both "borne away with" and "struggling to transcend" the soul and "to break out into the world": "We try to discover in things ... the reflection of what our soul has projected on to them; we are disillusioned when we find that they are in reality devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; ..." (1: 93). My reading of the Saint-Hilaire and the Martinville spires will demonstrate how they reflect "what the soul has projected on to them" while they at the same time "struggle to transcend the soul and to break out into the world." This drive to merge with the world is highly erotic, leading to a second register where the spires in the novel play a key role. As phallus, "finger of God," spires punctuate the text with a rhythmic alternation between exhila- ration and despair, excitement and quietude. As phallic "gazers," spires are sometimes voyeurs; at other times (as in the Martinville episode), they solicit the gaze of the Other, becoming exhibitionists standing in a clear métonymie and metaphoric relation to women the narrator desires (his mother, the duchess of Guermantes, Gilberte, Albertine).2 The narrator's earliest adventures into erotic reverie and masturbation are all closely associated with the phallic tower of Roussainville, either viewed from the little room at the top of his aunt's house that was his refuge for "reading or day-dreaming, secret tears or sensual gratification [la volupté ]" (1: 13), or evoked later on: Alas, it was in vain that I implored the castle-keep of Roussainville, that I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village, appealing to it as to the sole confidant of my earliest desires when at the top of our house in Combray, in the little room that smelt of orris-root, I could see nothing but its tower framed in the half-opened window as, . . . faint with emotion, I explored ... an untrodden path which for all I knew was deadly- until the moment when a natural trail like that left by a snail smeared the leaves of the flowering currant that drooped around me. (1: 172)</page><page sequence="3">Self, Desire, and Writing 393 Finally, it is the spires- particularly the spires of Martinville- that pro- vide for the transition from desire to writing, becoming stylus as well as phallus, locus of the act of writing. II. The View from Saint-Hilaire Of all those things that emerge from the narrator's celebrated cup of tea, it is the Saint-Hilaire church- more precisely, the steeple of the church- that emerges first and continues to function as a dominating figure for the village of Combray, the narrator's life and the entire novel: The steeple of Saint-Hilaire could be distinguished from a long way off, inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon against which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, ... he would say: "Come on, get your wraps together, we're there." (1: 67-68) The steeple of Saint-Hilaire is the center where the narrator and the novel arrive; it is also the point of departure for the larger quest. It symbolizes, in the deepest sense, the hope and faith of the narrator, "the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a unique essence" (1: 71; emphasis added). What becomes clear as the novel unfolds is that the many views of this spire will finally become the view from the spire. The interplay between the view of the steeple by the empirical, experiencing, aspiring self and the view from the steeple's transcendent self figures the fun- damental tensions informing the text. The infinitely varied views of the spire figure those "promenades," both physical and spiritual, along the two ways (Méséglise and Guermantes, love and society) that are the necessary prepa- ration for the unifying epiphany of Time Regained : the view from Saint-Hilaire. In the long description of the steeple near the beginning of "Combray," it is the steeple's extraordinary mutability that is so striking. At each hour of the day, the narrator conserves a series of separate impressions of the church: on hot Sunday mornings, at five o'clock, during the morning errands, and (anachronically) "even today" (1: 72). Temporally dispersed, the steeple is also spatially dispersed, a moving, changing object. In and around Combray, it moves as if of its own volition ("as it slipped into every fold of the sky"; "here and there among the houses, . . . even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church" [1: 67, 70]). The narrator perceives it from the train approaching Combray, from the countryside outside the village, from his room, and from the streets of Combray. The wandering of the church spire extends beyond Combray, as it is associated in the narrator's heart with churches, clock towers, and other spires in Balbec, Paris, and Venice. The church steeple is, of course, the magnetic center of Combray, ever drawing the narrator back:</page><page sequence="4">394 Nancy Lane "[I]t was always to the steeple that one must return, always the steeple that dominated everything else, . . . raised before me like the Finger of God" (1: 71); this attraction is possible, however, only because of the countervailing pull that draws the narrator (and the text) away from this center, physically and spiritually, in space and in time, toward Guermantes and Méséglise, Paris, Balbec, and Venice. Finally, the steeple is the locus of systematic semantic dispersion through constant analogy and assimilation with its environment. As Gérard Genette has shown (44), this steeple (along with the many other steeples in the work) continually exchanges terms with its surroundings, be- coming a golden brioche, a soft brown cushion, and so on. As an object of perception, the steeple triggers that succession of images and analogies that reflect the variety of experience of the empirical self; the metamorphoses and mobility of the object are a function of the shifting, relative nature of percep- tion. Yet, the steeple also represents the hope that it may be climbed someday, providing a panoramic view that would integrate rather than disperse reality, that would provide access to essences, rather than impressions. It is significant that the narrator is absent (he is out reading in the garden) while the curé describes to Aunt Léonie what the view from Saint-Hilaire is like: "But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur" (1: 114). The height of the spire figures the transcendent imagination, or the higher power of the creative mind: in order to admire "the beautiful panorama," or to rise above the quotidian self that must remain earthbound, the narrator (and the artist- writer and the reader) must make this perilous and fatiguing ascent, the rising up of consciousness. The ascent is fraught with peril ("Certainly in your case, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you to climb our ninety-seven steps. . . . It's quite tiring enough for the most active person, especially as you have to bend double if you don't wish to crack your skull" [1: 114]) certainly for the frail narrator, for the artist whose quasi-sacred vo- cation is to write that work of art which alone can regain the continuity of the past and penetrate the world of essences, and finally for the reader, who must make the ascent with the novel in order for the latter to achieve its goal. Once the summit is reached, it is a cold, lonely place, close to death ("In any case you should be well wrapped up, . . . for there's a strong breeze there once you get to the top. Some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there" [1: 114]), but the reward for the climber is an "entrancing" [ féerique ] view: "No doubt about it, the view from up there is entrancing, with what you might call vistas over the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own" (1: 114). The perilous ascent of Saint-Hilaire is strikingly sexual. The pleasure one achieves upon reaching the top is "jouissance," not only delight, but sexual gratification ("jouir" means to come to a sexual climax). Furthermore, the name of the locality visible from the top is "Jouy-le-Vicomte," a name con-</page><page sequence="5">Self, Desire, and Writing 395 taining two sexual allusions (first, to "jouir," and then to "le vit," a term for the penis). The upward movement of the spire serves to counterbalance the outward spatial movement of the narrator's promenades. The narrator's everwidening circles of exploration moving out from the center rupture the unity created for him by Saint-Hilaire; this outward movement is in tension with the upward movement of the steeple. Thus is symbolized the fundamental tension in the novel between the quest of the empirical self (an outward, "horizontal" force) and the vertical force of the transcendental self, able to rise above time and space to embrace the apparently contradictory, disappointing, mutually exclu- sive realities encountered all along the way.3 The view from the top of Saint- Hilaire permits the viewer to embrace at once two separate and mutually exclusive realities; as the curé tells us, you can see at the same time places which you normally see one without the other, as, for instance, ... the various canals at Jouy-le- Vicomte. . . . Every time I've been to Jouy I've seen a bit of canal in one place, and then I've turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried to put them together in my mind's eye; it was no good. But from the top of Saint-Hilaire it's quite another matter- a regular network in which the place is enclosed. (1: 1 14-15) Just as the curé is unable to achieve through intellection any understanding of the relationship among the various canals of Jouy-le-Vicomte, the narrator imagines the two ways (Guermantes and Méséglise, society and love) in ab- solutely different worlds: But above all I set between them, far more than the mere distance in miles that separated one from the other, the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one of those distances of the mind which not only keep things apart, but cut them off from one another and put them on different planes. . . . [T]he habit we had of never going both ways on the same day . . . shut them off, so to speak, far apart from one another and unaware of each other's existence, in the airtight compartments of separate afternoons. (1: 147) The view from Saint-Hilaire not only brings together these apparently mutually exclusive worlds; it also transforms them: "Only, you can't see any water; it's as though there were great clefts slicing up the town so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up" (1: 115). The transformation of water and village into slices in a brioche is achieved by that analogic power possessed by the transcendent self in the novel: not only does it embrace the two paths that will lead ultimately to art, but it has the power to transform surface impressions into metaphoric or analogic equivalents, the power that is the very motor of the novel, temporalizing as well as spatializing metaphor. The steeple functions not only as object of perception, but as subject. Early on, it is endowed with consciousness, wit, good manners, personality:</page><page sequence="6">396 Nancy Lane ... it was in its steeple that it [the church] seemed most truly to find itself, to affirm its individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple that spoke for the church. . . . [M]y grandmother found in the steeple of Combray ... a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say: "My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not con- ventionally beautiful, but there is something in its quaint old face that pleases me. If it could play the piano, I'm sure it wouldn't sound tinny." (1: 69) These anthropomorphic descriptions reinforce the identification between the spire and the transcendent self, reflected back on itself in a mise-en-abyme by the waters of the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, of the Vivonne, of the sea at Balbec, of the Venetian canals, and all the other watery mirrors found at every sig- nificant point in the novel from Elstir's seascapes, the Guermantes's baignoire, and Berma's mermaid-like appearance as Phèdre, to the damp toilets and frozen snows of the Champs Elysées. As the curé says, "To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up at the top of the steeple of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte" (1: 115), which is, of course, precisely the position of the doubled self (subject and object, empirical and transcendent) in the entire novel. As a boy in Combray, the narrator can see only the base of the spire from his room; many years later he again sees the steeple from his window at Tansonville, and it serves only to remind him of how distant his childhood has become, "putting in visible form a distance of miles and of years" (3: 716). As the end of the novel approaches, however, the narrator has not only ascended the steeple, he has become one with it, and identification of the steeple with the transcendent self is clear: he looks down, tired and fearful, from the "giddy summit" of time, through "this vast di- mension which I had not known myself to possess": "A feeling of vertigo seized me as I looked down beneath me, yet within me, as though from a height, which was my own height, of many leagues, at the long series of the years" (3: 1106). This steeple's subjectivity transcends even itself. Even as it gazes out over the spiritual landscape of the novel, it "aspires"; it points toward heaven: ". . . the effort which the steeple was making to hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven"; "raised before me like the Finger of God" (1: 71). As a symbol of the subject-object dichotomy, the steeple both transcends the self and is iden- tified with it; furthermore, this identity and difference are present within the transcendent self. The view from Saint-Hilaire is a view inward as well as outward, just as the narrator finds that his outward gaze and search are ulti- mately directed inwardly: reminded of Saint-Hilaire in other cities, he sets out in search of it, but "I seek my way again, I turn a corner . . . but ... the goal is in my heart ..." (1: 72). Thus, the spire of Saint-Hilaire functions as a metaphor for the structure of the novel at least as apt as the more widely noted series of metaphors established in the first paragraph (literary, musical, architectural) or the later equivalents proposed by the narrator in the second half of Time Regained (a</page><page sequence="7">Self, Desire, and Writing 397 dress made from scraps, a stew, and so on); the spire at once figures the relative nature of perception and the aspiration toward transcendence which underlie the novel. It functions both to disintegrate and to integrate; in it, subject and object merge, both retaining and transcending the paradox of their dichotomy. Finally, the spire of Saint-Hilaire figures both the closure and the openness of the text. On the one hand, it repeatedly figures closure for Combray, for the nar- rator's life, and for the novel: "Combray at a distance . . . was no more than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon . . ."; "It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every view in the town" (1: 52, 69). Viewed from the top of Saint-Hilaire, all of the systematic parallels between Guermantes's and Swann's ways, all of the apparent oppositions (Madame Verdurin and the Princesse de Guermantes; Swann's daughter and Oriane's nephew) are resolved into a unity whose final symbol is Mlle de Saint- Loup, the physical incarnation of the union of the two ways. The narrator comes in the end to see that the long path through society and love, which he thought had taken him irretrievably far from his goal, was in fact the necessary path toward it. All of these empirical recurrences and unities marking the novel are only symbols of the transcendental closure at work in it; each is trivial in itself, but each symbolizes the power that comes from transcending such radical disparities as those separating Biche from Elstir, for example, or Odette from Miss Sacripant and "the lady in pink." Yet, despite the powerful pull toward closure, the text of Remembrance of Things Past ultimately remains open, not closed. The very structure of the synthesis that pulls toward integration and closure contains and must maintain the ineffaceable difference (self/not self; subject/object; empirical self/tran- scendent self) necessary for the production of the transcendent "I." The steeple of Saint-Hilaire not only continues to strain and rise toward heaven, but it also becomes ineffable: ". . . the cries of the birds that wheeled around it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words [ ineffable ]" (90). Thus, the steeple continues to rise as subject- a movement echoed inversely at the end of the novel- and continues to disappear into the ineffable as object. III. Martinville, Desire, and Writing As we have seen, the steeple of Saint-Hilaire- point of departure and goal for the quest of the empirical self- stands at the center of the novel. It is, however, the narrator's pursuit of the Martinville spires that marks the passage from desire to writing, from contemplation to creation, and the emergence in the text of the transcendental self.</page><page sequence="8">398 Nancy Lane Until the Martinville episode, the narrator's desire to transcend the par- ticular will has been associated primarily with reading and reverie. During the long afternoons spent reading in the garden at Combray, the narrator struggles to penetrate the essence of the world through literature. For Schopenhauer, it is in contemplating a work of art that the observer may escape the individual will by considering only the nature of things and turning entirely to intuition. The observer (here, the reader) then becomes pure subject, indistinguishable from intuition itself (Henry 71). This passage to pure subjectivity is the same process that occurs during reverie, a state that Edouard Morot-Sir links to writing and Proustian creation: "What the Narrator says about his reading- reveries at Combray, with the St. Hilaire bell-tower chiming the hours, applies even more to writing, true flight outside of time. . . . Just as reading is writing at a second level, writing ... is a reading in the first instance, even for the writer" (910-11; my translation). It is in the Martinville sequence that the narrator achieves for the first time the transition from reading-reverie to writ- ing-reverie. This is where the self emerges who will write the steeples, not just contemplate them as a virtual artist. As we have already seen, the state of reverie is often associated with erotic desire, and it is not surprising to find that the Martinville episode is set in just such a context. (As David Ellison remarks in his fine study, such passages should never be read outside their context [4].) The origin of the narrator's desire to write the Martinville spires lies in his fantasies concerning the Duch- esse de Guermantes: "I used to dream that Mme de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy to me, invited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side" (1: 188). He fantasizes that she will ask him about his writing: "And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished some day to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I was going to write" (1: 188). At a loss to know what subject he might write about, he is immediately overcome by despair: "[M]y consciousness would be faced with a blank, I would feel either that I was wholly devoid of talent or that perhaps some malady of the brain was hindering its development" (1: 188-89). "Utterly despondent," he is led to renounce literature forever. In the passage immediately following this renunciation of the artistic vocation, the narrator sees the Duchesse for the first time at the wedding of Dr. Percepied's daughter. Here, the narrator's desire becomes focused on the Duchesse in an intense scopic drive. Vision becomes an active, quasi-material force that has the power to reach out and touch things, not just a passive receptor of impressions. The Lacanian gaze and its relation to desire subtends this entire passage and will continue to dominate the Martinville episode. Commenting on Sartre's notion of the gaze of the Other, Lacan states, "The gaze I encounter ... is, not a seen gaze, but a gaze imagined by me in the field of the Other" (84). Such is the case with the gaze of the Duchesse during Mile Percepied's wedding:</page><page sequence="9">Self, Desire, and Writing 399 And then- oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray alone as far as it may choose-. . . her gaze wandered here and there, . . . and even rested momentarily upon myself, like a ray of sunlight which . . . appeared conscious of where it fell. (1: 192) The narrator desires that she stay in the church long enough for him to look at her: I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her I should be able to carry away and store up inside myself the memory of . . . all those details which struck me as so many precious, authentic and singular items of information with regard to her face. (1: 192) Repeated allusions to vision, glances, and gazes mark this entire passage, and the scopic drive leads to sexual desire: And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she should look on us with contempt, . . . and that we should think that she can never be ours, sometimes, too, it is enough that she should look on us kindly, . . . and that we should think of her as almost ours already. (1: 194) Yet, as Lacan points out, in the economy of desire, the lover never can possess that gaze that he solicits: "When, in love, I solicit a look, what is profoundly unsatisfying and always missing is that- You never look at me from the place from which I see you " (103). It is in the writing of the Martinville sketch, following directly the narrator's first gaze upon the Duchesse, that the narrator will try to fill in this lack. Convinced that he has no talent, the narrator has abandoned literature and turned toward the world, hoping to penetrate sense impressions and what they conceal, "to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beyond what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to come and take but which despite all my efforts I never managed to discover" (1: 195). As he desires to possess Mme de Guermantes, the narrator would like to possess the "secret treasure" con- cealed behind these impressions "which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be bursting, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the lids" (1: 195). While the scopic drive, this visual attempt to penetrate the surface of sense impressions, does not lead to gratification, the narrator nevertheless feels a clearly sexual enjoyment, "an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity" (1: 195). This enjoyment will intensify and become gratification (if only temporary) with the Martinville spires. It is significant that Dr. Percepied's carriage is the site of writing of the Martinville episode. Percepied is the narrator's link to the Duchesse, for it was at his daughter's wedding that the narrator saw the Duchesse, fell under her gaze, and fell in love with her. The special pleasure of perceiving the spires is</page><page sequence="10">400 Nancy Lane enhanced by the movements of the carriage, both the up and down, sexually suggestive jolting, and the linear movement that makes the steeples appear to shift position. This pleasure, scopic and sexual, the desire to "penetrate to the core" and to discover "something more . . . something which they seemed at once to contain and conceal" (1: 196), reaches a double climax in the carriage. First, the spires give up something of what they were concealing, "and the pleasure which the first sight of them had given me was so greatly enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer think of anything else" (1: 197). As described in the passage itself, the three spires respond to the narrator's desire: "lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again their sun-bathed pinnacles in token of farewell. Sometimes one would withdraw so the other two might watch us for a moment still" (1: 198). As was the case with the Duchesse, the narrator has solicited the gaze of the feminine Other- "three maidens in a legend." The second climax occurs with the act of writing itself. Taking up pencil and paper, the narrator discovers the key to his desire to take possession of and merge with the world in the reverie of writing. Parting ways with Scho- penhauer, for whom music is the supreme art, the only one affording direct access to essences, the Proustian text accords the highest power to the act of writing. It is through writing that the narrator discovers that "what lay hidden behind the steeples of Martinville must be something analogous to a pretty phrase, since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me" (1: 197). The pleasure the narrator feels upon finishing the writing is orgasmic. Rather than an illusion of fecundity, he now feels as though he were a hen who had just laid an egg, the fertile product of an ejaculation that leaves him singing at the top of his voice. The dynamics of desire that link the act of writing to the scopic drive and to the erotic are thus brought into focus by the spires of Martinville.4 The Martinville episode leads to the end of Combray, carrying the text from its center to the point of departure for the longer journey to come. The last words of "Combray" ("the uplifted forefinger of dawn"), like the "finger of God" of an ineffable Saint-Hilaire, point the way upward to the transcen- dental self and the way outward of the empirical self in this reverie of writing. Notes 1 As the novel progresses, the view from above is figured increasingly often by airplanes, reflecting both the war years intervening in the composition of the novel and the strong emotional charge attaching to airplanes both in Proust's life and in his work (through association with Agostinelli and Albertine). As the narrator rides in the carriage to the reception that will bring the novel's epiphany in Time Regained, he compares himself to an aviator: "And like an airman who hitherto has progressed laboriously</page><page sequence="11">Self, Desire, and Writing 401 along the ground, abruptly 'taking off I soared slowly towards the silent heights of memory" (3: 890). Reflecting on the relation between literature and reality, the narrator later explicitly establishes the link between steeples and airplanes: "How could the literature of description possibly have any value, when it is only beneath the surface of the little things which such a literature describes that reality has its hidden existence (grandeur, for example, in the distant sound of an aeroplane or the outline of the steeple of Saint-Hilaire . . .)" (3: 931). 2 The twin steeples of Saint- André-les-Champs are associated with Gilberte, whose presence the narrator senses in the breeze coming from Laon (1: 159). The same as- sociation between church steeples and Albertine (this time, explicitly sexual) reappears in Cities of the Plain (2: 1044, 1046-48). 3 Georges Poulet touches on (but does not pursue) the significance of the view from Saint-Hilaire (436). 4 Erotic desire continues into the paragraph immediately following this episode, which brings into focus the sublimated object of the narrator's most passionate desire: his mother. He begins by evoking the Duchesse once more, only to fall back into the agony of longing for his mother: "How readily would I have sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry all night long in Mamma's arms!"
