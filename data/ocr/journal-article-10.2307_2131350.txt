<plain_text><page sequence="1">Voegelin's Search for Order Fred Dallmayr University of Notre Dame In Search of Order. By Eric Voegelin. (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Uni- versity Press, 1987. Pp. 120. $14.95.) The torrent of recent publications contains a small gem which has not suf- ficiently been noticed perhaps by philosophers and political theorists: Eric Voegelin's In Search of Order. Posthumously published, the slender volume constitutes a fitting epitaph to the author's life-long intellectual journey and pilgrim's progress. As is well known, Voegelin's sprawling opus ranged over the fields of philosophy, politics, anthropology, and history (to mention just a few); probably his most celebrated work so far had been the multi-volume Order and History' which recounted the "history of order" from the dawn of mankind to the "ecumenic age" and which has justly been acclaimed as a clas- sic of philosophical historiography in our time. In Search of Order serves as sequel and capstone to this magnum opus-with a twist. The unsuspecting and hurried reader might have expected the volume to yield a final summa- tion, a definitive statement of the author's position regarding order. Yet, as it stands, the volume is a torso and offers no complete doctrine -which aptly matches the author's steadily growing conviction of the unending and unfin- ishable character of his quest (and of any genuine inquiry). In the words of Ellis Sandoz who introduces the volume (p. 1): "The fact that the quest of or- der is an unfinished story as told by Voegelin is most fitting; for, as he insisted, neither reality nor philosophy can be reduced to a system. Thus, the form of the present work can be said to symbolize Voegelin's philosophical vision of history and comprehensive reality as an unfinished tale, one told by God in the reflective language of spiritually gifted men and women open to the mys- tery of truth." While revealing as an epitaph, however, the new volume has more than autobiographical significance. Generally speaking, Voegelin's writings cannot narrowly be tied to authorial intent-because of the broader "mystery of truth" in which inquiry proceeds. The reason that, for him, philosophy could not be reduced to a "system" was not resignation or some penchant for ob- 1 Unless otherwise indicated all page references are to volume 5 of this book.

As a participatory act, reflection could not be limited to neutral description but always carried moral-political and broadly "exis- tential" connotations. There can be little doubt that Voegelin's entire opus was an outgrowth of or response to the perceived agonies of our age, as ex- perienced from the vantage of a reflective participant. In heightened form, this is also true of In Search of Order whose dense formulations and efforts at symbolization are designed to have both diagnostic and therapeutic rele- vance. As Voegelin himself states in the opening pages (pp. 13-14): "The book is meant to be read"-namely, as "an event in a vast social field of thought and language, of writing and reading about matters which the members of the field believe to be of concern for their existence in truth." The book would basically be pointless unless it had a function or bearing "in a communion of existential concern." In the following I shall first give a condensed synopsis of some of the main themes discussed in the volume. Next, I intend to high- light aspects of the book which seem to me particularly intriguing or fruitful in the context of contemporary discussions in philosophy and political thought. By way of conclusion I shall voice some general questions or reserva- tions-questions which, I believe, are in tune with Voegelin's concerns and especially with his emphasis on the open-ended and unfinishable quality of reflective endeavors. I In Search of Order is broadly divided into two parts: the first part dealing with general philosophical themes, the second carrying a more historical- recollective character. The first chapter opens with a basic philosophical prob- lem, namely, the problem of the "beginning" or archer " in any reflective endeavor-which raises immediately all the issues concerning the relation be- tween whole and part, foreground and background, text and context. Drawing on some of his earlier investigations, Voegelin phrases the issues in terms of the status of "consciousness" vis-a-vis reality, a status he finds "paradoxical" or ambivalent because it can assume essentially two forms. On the one hand, he writes (pp. 15-16), "we speak of consciousness as a something located in human beings in their bodily existence. In relation to this concretely embod- ied consciousness, reality assumes the position of an object intended" or of an "external thingness" juxtaposed to an intending consciousness. On the other hand, embodied consciousness is itself part of a certain reality-no longer of external thingness but of a background reality which enables con- sciousness to function; in this second sense, we read, reality is "not an object of consciousness but the something in which consciousness occurs as an event of participation between partners in the community of being." The duality of relations leads Voegelin to the formulation of two types of reality, namely</page><page sequence="3">Voegelin's Search for Order 413 "thing-reality" and "It-reality," and two modes of consciousness called "inten- tionality" and "luminosity" respectively. As used in the phrase "It-reality," the term "it" has not so much ontic-empirical as rather ontological signifi- cance: it involves that "mysterious 'it' that also occurs in everyday language in such phrases as 'it rains.' " The entire distinction between modes of reality and of consciousness can also be seen as a subject-predicate exchange, in the sense that "reality moves from the position of an intended object to that of a subject, while the consciousness of the human subject intending objects moves to the position of a predicative event in the subject 'reality' as it be- comes luminous for its truth." In the following, the preceding duality is further expanded and complicated by the addition of language-which yields the triple structure of "consciousness-reality-language" as general framework guiding the volume's inquiries. As Voegelin observes, language can be apprehended either as an empirical body of signs or else as a creative agency bestowing meaning on the world. "Words and their meanings," he writes (p. 17), "are just as much part of the reality to which they refer as the being things are partners in the com- prehending reality; language participates in the paradox of a quest that lets reality become luminous for its truth by pursuing truth as a thing intended." The ambivalent character of language is reflected in the distinction between "concept" and "symbol" and, more generally, in the differentiation between scientific explanation and understanding or between the natural- mathematical sciences and the humanities. According to Voegelin, neither of the two types of disciplines can claim to capture the complete truth. The rep- resentatives of both types, he notes (p. 18), "are right in their pursuit of truth as long as they confine themselves to areas of reality in which the structures of their preference predominate"; but they are "wrong when they engage in magic dreams of a truth that can be reached by concentrating exclusively on either the intentionality of conceptualizing science or the luminosity of mythic and revelatory symbols." In trying to illustrate the complex structure of his approach and particularly the paradox of "beginnings," Voegelin turns to the creation story as told in Genesis, chapter 1. Reflecting on the role of language in that story ("And God said: Let there be light"), he notes that the spoken word here is "more than a mere sign signifying something"; rather, language is endowed with a cre- ative potency or power which "evokes structures in reality by naming them." This power, in turn, is ascribed to God or to the breath or spirit of God (or rather of a plural divinity, elohim)-which is a symbolization of the underlying It-reality enabling the world to be. This underlying reality, we are told (pp. 19-22), is "symbolized as the strong movement of a spiritual consciousness, imposing form on a formless and non-forming countermovement, as the ten- sion between a pneumatic, formative force and an at least passively resistant counterforce." Thus, when penning the first lines of their text, the authors</page><page sequence="4">414 Fred Dallmayr of Genesis, chapter 1 "were conscious of beginning an act of participation in the mysterious Beginning of the It." Cognizant of the difficulties of biblical exegesis, Voegelin immediately seeks to ward off certain "conventional mis- understandings" hampering access to the text. First of all, the symbolism of the creation story must in his view not be "psychologized" or misread as an "anthropomorphism," that is, as "the projection of a human into a divine consciousness"-which would vitiate or muffle the role of the invoked It- reality in the story. More important, the creative happening engendered by the It-reality should be seen as a language-event, as the deed of the "pneu- matic word," and not as the simple imposition of a subjective idea on a form- less matter construed in terms of thing-reality. In Voegelin's account, the formless waste alluded to in the story was neither a thing nor a mere no-thing: it was not a "thing" if the term denotes "any structure experienced as real in post-creational reality"; it was not nothing, for in this case no "creative evo- cation of something" would be feasible. Instead of designating an external matter, the formless waste rather preserved the notion of an "originally (co-)generating maternal reality"; probably linked with the "Babylonian tia- mat," the creation story evoked "the mythic meaning of feminine productivity in the act of generation." According to Voegelin, the creative beginning recounted in Genesis, chap- ter 1 was not a one-time happening but reverberates through human history seen as experiential openness to the "command of the pneumatic word." As in his earlier writings, he distinguishes between a series of spiritual "epiph- anies" throughout history, ranging from Genesis over the patriarchs to the prophets, from Taoist, Hindu, and Buddhist teachings to Greek philosophy and Christianity-each with its distinct and progressively more highly differ- entiated symbolization of the creative event. Typically, new modes of sym- bolization are reactions to prevalent but decaying or decayed symbol systems and efforts to provide more elaborate or nuanced expression for the meaning structure of an age. "The quest for truth," we read (pp. 24-26), "is a move- ment of resistance to the prevalent disorder; it is an effort to attune the con- cretely disordered existence again to the truth of the It-reality, an attempt to create a new social field of existential order in competition with the fields whose claim to truth has become doubtful." If the attempt is successful in find- ing symbols which adequately capture "the newly differentiated experience of order," it may then become the beginning and leavening spirit of "a new social field." In large measure, Voegelin adds, the success of this endeavor depends on the ability of the new symbolization to express the "common sense" of a period, that is, its ability to speak not in a distant-alien idiom but with an "authority commonly present in everybody's consciousness": "The ap- peal will be no more than a private opinion unless the questioner finds in the course of his quest the word (logos) that indeed speaks what is common (xynon) to the order of man's existence as a partner in the comprehending re-</page><page sequence="5">Voegelin's Search for Order 415 ality; only if the questioner speaks the common logos of reality can he evoke a truly public order." Attunement to and recovery of "pneumatic" meaning is not simply an act of human invention or fabrication; but neither is it an external intervention cancelling human participation. According to Voegelin, this participatory as- pect is captured in the Platonic notion of the "metaxy" or of the "between- status" of spiritual life. The search for meaning and truth, he notes (pp. 27- 32), "can be a true story only if the questioner participates existentially in the comprehending story told by the It through its creative epiphany of struc- ture." Metaxy in this context means the tensional balance between human and divine reality and also between ordinary temporality and eternity; in this sense, Plato came to symbolize ordinary time as "the moving eikon of eter- nity." Precariously lodged at the intersection of immanence and transcen- dence, metaxy signals-in Voegelin's words-"an eruption of order within time in response to an irruption of order from the beyond of time." In Platonic thought, this "beyond of time" was portrayed as a divine-immortal sphere, as the "epekeina of all being things (ta onta)" or as the formative "nous." In human life and especially in the philosopher's quest for truth, this sphere manifests itself as a "formative force" or as the experienced disclosure or "Pa- rousia of the formative It-reality in all things" -a disclosure imposing on or- dinary temporality the dimension of "divine presence." As Voegelin cautions, the Platonic notion should not itself be turned into a rigid doctrine, since it is only one of different historical ways of symbolizing the creative event. Still, while recognizing a "plurality" of possible stories and quests, the volume does not endorse a simple historicism or historical relativism. Instead, the different historical formulations are seen as variations on a common theme or as distinct "episodes" occurring within the "same comprehending It-story." Thus, the diversity of historical experience can be grasped and understood "as a field of languages, intelligibly symbolizing the truth of reality in conformity with the recognizable structure of the complex." Although open to human participation, the "beyond of time" cannot or must not become the target of human manipulation or control; where It-reality is instrumentalized or reduced to "thingness," the road is open to disorder and deformation-as history amply attests. In Voegelin's account (pp. 33-37), the millennial quest for order and truth is offset and paralleled by a constant coun- terpull: namely, the temptation "to deform the Beyond and its formative Pa- rousia" by corrupting the beyond into a tool and its parousia into the "im- position of a definite form on reality." Throughout history, this temptation occurs in different guises. On the level of historical speculation, deformation takes the shape of a unilinear history assumed to culminate or reach its telos in the writer's conception -a type extending "from the Sumerian king-list to Hegel's imperial speculation." Where the assumption prevails that the divine beyond can be directly implemented in a given historical context, we are in</page><page sequence="6">416 Fred Dallmayr the presence of what Voegelin calls "metastatic speculation"-an ideological outlook which (he says) has remained a constant down to "the metastatic faith- movements of the twentieth century." Where political crisis or calamity be- comes particularly pronounced, metastatic belief gives way to "apocalyptic" thought which expects disorder of catastrophic magnitude to be "ended by divine intervention." Where such intervention is not forthcoming, apocalyp- tic thought in turn is supplemented or replaced by gnosticism, that is, a per- spective which construes the state of the world or the cosmos as the result of a corruption or "psychodramatic fall" in the beyond, a condition to be re- versed through human action based on a special "pneumatic understanding (gnosis)." Thus, alongside the search for truth and the attunement to its order, there runs through the centuries a "diversified history of untruth and disorder"-and even a story of "increasingly conscious resistance to begin- nings" (as initiated by the It-reality). In conformity with this antagonism, Voegelin distinguishes between "resistance to truth" and "agreement or dis- agreement about the optimal symbolization of truth," and similarly between "resisters" or reformerss," on the one hand, and searching or "questioning thinkers," on the other. An extreme case of resistance is "revolt" or rebellion against the inetaxy, a revolt directed either at "abolishing reality altogether and escaping into the Beyond" or at "forcing the order of the Beyond into reality" -the latter alternative being the preference of modern gnostics. Both the search for truth and resistance against it are experiential occur- rences in consciousness nurtured by the power of imagination. According to Voegelin (pp. 37-44), imagination is not solely a human faculty but part of the larger metaxy or of the consciousness-reality-language framework; in this sense one may say that "through the imaginative power of man the It-reality moves imaginatively toward its truth." Ultimately, the difference between genuine search and resistance can be traced to the stance adopted by con- sciousness and its imaginative strivings: a stance which is either self-assertive and anthropocentric or else reflectively seasoned, that is, marked by "re- flective distance" and by "remembrance" or recollection of the structure of the metaxy. In Platonic thought, the attitude of reflectively distancing re- membrance was symbolized as "anamnesis"; on the other hand, forgetfulness or oblivion of being was expressed by the symbol "anoia," conventionally translated as "folly." The man or resister afflicted with anoia-or with the Ci- ceronian morbus animi- is one who does not recall his role as a "partner in the community of being" and as a consequence transforms his searching par- ticipation into sheer "self-assertion." Against this background, imagination as- sumes the status of a "third dimension" of consciousness (alongside intention- ality and luminosity) manifesting itself either in reflective remembrance or oblivion. As Voegelin writes: "When a thinker, whatever his motives may be, forgets his role as a partner of being" he "can deform the remembered asser- tive power of imagination in his quest imaginatively into the sole power of</page><page sequence="7">Voegelin's Search for Order 417 truth. Imaginative remembrance of the process, the remembrance intended by Plato, implies the potential of imaginative oblivion." The second part of the volume is an excursus in the history of philosophical thought, with the focus initially being placed on German idealism. In Voege- lin's account (pp. 48-51), German philosophy of the time was in large measure a countermove to the "deformation of consciousness" brought about by tra- ditional metaphysics and especially by the habit of thinking "in terms of thing- reality"-a habit reinforced by the success of modern natural science and its (partial) legitimation through Kant. As an antidote to this deformation, Ger- man thought-starting with Fichte's "System of Science"-turned to the con- stitutive role of consciousness, and particularly to the transcendental self- constitution and self-identification of the "I" through an act of "intellectual intuition." In this manner, Voegelin notes, consciousness was essentially cast in the mode of intentionality-to the virtual exclusion of its existential- ontological underpinnings; eclipsing the structure of the inetaxy, a "nonpar- ticipatory" type of intentionalism tended to usurp the "authority of partici- patory consciousness." As he reminds us, this usurpation was part of a larger historical upheaval manifesting itself concretely in the American, French, and Dutch revolutions; endorsing this upheaval, German philosophy derived much of its elan from the sense of "participating in a world-historic revolution of consciousness." What emerged from this revolutionary ferment was a spec- ulative outlook emphasizing subjectivity and subjective self-constitution -an outlook commonly called "ego philosophy" or "identity philosophy," and which from Voegelin's vantage is a new and aggravated type of self-assertive deformation. In his words (p. 53): "A solidly detailed, historically knowledge- able, comprehensive attack on symbols that have lost their meaning" suc- cumbed in German thought to deformation "through the desire to dominate in the mode of thing-reality over the experience recovered." His own category of "reflective distance" is introduced precisely in order to distinguish his ap- proach from the "symbolism of reflective identity" favored by German idealist philosophy. The most glaring example of "identitarian" deformation, in Voegelin's view, was Hegel, to whom a long section of the volume is devoted. Relying mainly on the "Preface" and "Introduction" to the Phenomenology of Spirit, Voegelin castigates Hegel's replacement of existential tension by the attempted con- struction of a "scientific system" and his substitution of "absolute knowledge" for "love of knowledge." What these changes signaled, he states (pp. 54-59), was basically the "abolition of philosophy" accomplished through the exclu- sion of the "experience of existential consciousness, of existence in the tension of the metaxy. " This exclusion casts its shadow also on Hegel's dialectic of con- sciousness, especially on the movement from "first order" to "second order" objects (as outlined in the "Introduction"). As Voegelin comments: "The new object does not arise as a new external object, but through a 'turning around</page><page sequence="8">418 Fred Dallmayr of consciousness -a turning or "Umkehrung" which Hegel also describes as "our addition" (unsere Zutat). While recognizing a broad affinity between this turning and Plato's periagoge (of the prisoner in the cave), the volume denounces Hegel's description as basically vitiating the affinity: If we look "for the light shining from the Beyond that forces, directly or through a mediator, the prisoner to turn, we receive instead the information that the periagoge is unsere Zutat, our addition or addendum. The periagoge is not an assertive response but a self-assertive action." By excluding the higher light Hegel is said to rely only on "natural" consciousness or on "natfirliche Erkenntnis in its deformative application to the It-reality." While assertively taking charge or control of the periagoge, Hegel's account is claimed to transform or "trans- mogrify" the light from beyond into a mere external compulsion, into "a Not- wendigkeit, a necessity that operates behind the back of the prisoners' con- sciousness and forces 'us' to produce one prepositionally deformed, intentionalist shadow in the Cave after another." Seen from this angle, Hegel's presentation in the Phienomenology emerges as "so unbelievably grotesque that one hardly dares to put it into plain language: Plato's work of a lifetime in exploring the experience of the quest, of its human-divine movements and countermovements . . . this overwhelmingly conscious drama of the quest, this reality of consciousness and its luminous symbolization in a philosopher's existence, is excluded from the 'experience of consciousness' and relegated to an unconscious 'necessity' behind Plato's back." In seeking to explain Hegel's idealist deformation or "imaginative obliv- ion," Voegelin returns (pp. 62-69) to the progressive-revolutionary climate of his age, particularly to the "modern, Protestant principle" of placing the "world of intellect into one's own mind" -a principle which, in Hegel's case, contained or comprehended a variety of "hermetic, apocalyptic, gnostic, and Neoplatonic strands" of speculation. What was at the core of this mixture of strands was basically a "paracletic eschatology," namely, the vision of "a de- scent of the Spirit that will achieve what the Petrine and Pauline Christianities have not achieved: the ultimately salvational Parousia of the beyond in this world" -a vision congruent with the self-assertive and "activist" mentality of modernity. In turn, what stands behind this modernist mentality is the steady obfuscation and oblivion of the divine sphere, the reduction of the term "God" to a "senseless sound"-a reduction which is the quintessence of modern ag- nosticism and the "authoritative expression of the God-is-dead movement that characterizes a period of Western modernity (now lasting for about three hundred years)." In Hegel's thought, the situation was complicated by his fre- quent references to parousia and the quasi-divine character ascribed to "ab- solute knowledge" -although, according to Voegelin, parousia here was "li- bidinously deformed by Hegel's self-assertive speculation." More importantly, Hegel's identitarian outlook obscured the role of remembrance and reflective distance by seeking to bring everything into actual cognitive grasp. As a result-we are told-insight into the paradoxic structure of reality</page><page sequence="9">Voegelin's Search for Order 419 and history was "self-assertively deformed into a 'thing' to be mastered"; sim- ilarly, the distancing remembrance opening the historical horizon became "the instrument of its closure through the pretense that everything worth re- membering about the process of truth in reality had been remembered." In an effort to correct or reverse Hegel's deformed speculations, the volume journeys back to earlier historical phases where the search for truth can still be encountered in its "original, undeformed" shape-the first stop being He- siod's Theogony. In the opening lines of his poem, Hesiod invokes and praises the Heliconian Muses as the divine mediators of the truth about reality as a whole. In Voegelin's words (pp. 70-74): "The poet experiences the truth of reality as a divine Beyond, not to be grasped by intentional consciousness in its Ansich, but to be mediated through the Parousia of the Muses"; to this extent, truth is presented as an "existential, revelatory event" located in the metaxy of divine-human encounter. As the daughters of Mnemosyne (remem- brance) from her union with Zeus, the Muses trace their origin to the Olym- pian or rather "Jovian Beyond," and their task is to serve as mnemonic mark- ers, reminding the Olympians of their divinity. In Hesiod's usage, remembrance does not recollect a dead past but a living presence encompass- ing past and future. Basically, recollection here recalls the "presence of the Beyond" as it is experienced and gains "the reality of its Parousia in the lan- guage of the gods." As Voegelin indicates, however, Hesiod's poem was pre- cariously lodged at the edge of god-talk; pushing to the limit of available sym- bolization, he showed that "there are no gods without a Beyond of the gods." Differently phrased: Hesiod's symbols were still "compactly divine," without sufficiently distinguishing the experiential parousia of the gods from "its Beyond" (despite hints pointing in this direction). Steps toward more nuanced differentiation were undertaken by pre-Socratic thinkers and especially by Parmenides, the self-described "knowing man" (eidos phos). In the Par- menidean attack on the Homeric-Hesiodian legacy, Voegelin notes (pp. 86- 91), the "divine Beyond as the eternal Now" begins to become articulate on its own, while the "being" that was previously predicated of all things (ta eonta) turns into a "Being" which is non-synonymous with things. Despite a lingering compactness of his language, Parmenides had become aware of "the paradox of consciousness, of the tension between intentionality and luminos- ity, between thing-reality and It-reality, as well as the complex ofconsciousness- reality-language in its integrality." Hesitations and inadequacies of pre- Socratic thought were finally outstripped by "Socrates-Plato" with his fully differentiated symbolism of"Nous-in-Psyche-in-Soma," a symbolism combin- ing and reconciling the eternal "beyond" with temporal "becoming" or "non- genetic being" with "nonbeing genesis" (the two poles being further supple- mented by the third category of "chora" or space). The concluding section of the study is devoted to a detailed exegesis of Pla- to's Timaeus and its complex symbolization of reality and the cosmos. Pointing to the tensional character of the metaxy, Voegelin (pp. 92-94) comments that</page><page sequence="10">420 Fred Dallmayr in the Timaeus "reality is experienced as a tensional oneness in which the poles of the tension carry different weights of reality, while the tension be- tween the poles has its own weight of constancy." He also notes certain "lin- guistic difficulties" arising from the tensional structure of the symbolization, difficulties which could (and to some extent did) induce Plato to resort to second-order and third-order formulations or meta-discourses in order to counter ontic reification or doctrinal congealment of his symbols. A case in point is the notion of space or choral indicating the "unsensed" framework in which all beings appear. Narrowly or reductively construed, the notion seems to impose on all reality, including the framework itself, the "mode of thing- ness." In Voegelin's view, however, this construal has to be completely re- jected, for "it would transform luminous symbols, as they emerge from ten- sional experiences, into intentionalist concepts referring to objects," thereby destroying the "paradoxic structure" of the symbolization. Following Plato, Voegelin (pp. 99-102) interprets "space" not as a thingly structure but as an attribute of "cosmos" which, as a non-thing and as the "periechon of all things," makes room for space and all its thingly ingredients. This, however, does not entirely resolve the issue of space, since the quest for truth, guided by It-reality, also is supposed to take "place" somewhere and in some sense. At this point, the volume takes recourse to the imagery of a journey in which thing-reality and its beyond are linked at least metaphorically. "The quest for truth as an event in cosmic reality," we read, "appears to be ultimately the 'place' at which reality reveals itself in its structural complexity of thing-reality and It-reality. The event of the quest is the 'place' at which the bodily located consciousness of man experiences itself both in its thingly existence, that is, as moving in the thingly tensions of order-disorder, and in its visionary ex- istence, as a movement toward an unflawed order beyond the order that is flawed by the disorder of things." II Having journeyed with Voegelin through the pages of his final book, the reader will not easily put it aside. Congruent with the tenor of a participatory ontology, the study offers not an abstract doctrine but a kind of experiential encounter-whose urgency and transformative quality steadily intensifies in the concluding discussion of the Timaeus. Meant for posthumous reading, the reference to the "mysterious movement" from an "It-reality through thing- reality toward a Beyond of things" acquires touching biographical connotations -quite apart from showing an uncommon sensitivity for the depth of Plato's ontological speculation. Generally speaking, the interpreta- tion of Timaeus confirms Voegelin as one of the finest and most subtle students of Plato in our time-a distinction amply documented already in some of his earlier writings on Greek thought. The analysis of the metaxy as a tensional</page><page sequence="11">Voegelin's Search for Order 421 structure of order-disorder can readily be seen to have crucial philosophical as well as political-theoretical implications. Yet, beyond attesting to his ex- egetic competence, In Search of Order reveals Voegelin as an important spec- ulative thinker in his own right-as is evident in his own efforts at symbol- ization which, in some cases, transgress the Platonic model in their differentiated nuances. Voegelin is quite explicit about the need to go beyond a mere replication of time-honored teachings. As he says at one point in the text (p. 28), the problems surrounding the "middle" are "not exhausted by the (Platonic) symbolism of the metaxy"; the reason for this fact is the con- tinuing character of the creation story, the aspect that "the middle in which we begin as Western philosophers toward the end of the twentieth century, is not the middle in which the authors of Genesis had to begin their story about 500 B.C., nor is it the middle in which Plato developed his symbolism." In the context of contemporary philosophical discussions, Voegelin's stance toward past formulations or traditional teachings might be called "deconstructive"-although the term would hardly have found his favor. Picking up another contemporary expression, his conception of a tensional structure devoid of linear "beginnings" can be described as "non-" or "anti- foundational," in the sense of not being rooted in a substantive archer " or a constitutive subjectivity. This anti-foundational quality is particularly evident in the concluding pages of the study devoted to the question of final moorings (pp. 104-106). Might the Platonic "demiurge," Voegelin asks, be viewed as the Archimedean point through which the tensional structure of the metaxy could come to rest or reach its fulfillment? Rejecting this option, he insists that the demiurge is "not an absolute either"; for his action is "experienced and symbolized as a complex of tensions between formative, noetic order and non-formative space, between a demiurgic will to create order and the 'nec- essary' obstacle of chora that limits the creative will to thingness." Another way of suspending the tension and reaching stability might be found in the intimate correlation and mutual inherence of the tensional poles of being and becoming, of nous and chora. Plato at one point considers this possibility, when he likens nous to the formative source or "father" of reality and becom- ing to its "mother"-so that the resolution of the tension might be found in their mutual offspring (to ekgonos). Again, however, this symbolism provides no stable foundation because the offspring is precisely the witness and par- ticipating exemplar of the tensional metaxy: "Man, as part of the offspring, ex- periences himself not in a state of terminal paralysis but of existential move- ment, responsively inclined to the pull from either of the two poles"-where the polar dimensions include the "thingly Beyond" of the chora and the "divine Beyond" of the nous. The absence of foundations is closely related with Voegelin's distrust of closed philosophical "systems" and finished doctrines (especially doctrines nurtured by ideological-political ambitions). In this respect, his work follows</page><page sequence="12">422 Fred Dallmayr in the footsteps of Bergson's rejection of "closed" in favor of "open" societies and worldviews, and more generally of existentialist deprecations of philo- sophical closure. In the new volume (and elsewhere), the distrust extends ex- plicitly to theology seen as a doctrine about God or the gods. "All the gods," he writes in the section on Plato (p. 100), "have to live under the pressure of a divine Beyond that endows them with their divine life while threatening to let them die from their compactness." Moreover, this tensional pressure is portrayed as a "constant in the history of revelation: neither will the gods disappear, nor will the Beyond let them live in peace." These and similar statements are likely to antagonize religious fundamentalists or literalists hos- tile to "reflective distance" -as happened in the case of earlier passages (such as the provocative phrase in The New Science of Politics that "uncertainty is the very essence of Christianity"). As Sandoz judiciously remarks (pp. 6-7): "That there is anything uncertain about their faith came as unwelcome news to dogmatic Christians who reacted angrily to the suggestion, both in 1953 and on later similar occasions. " By pursuing the path of reflective meditation, Voegelin is liable to place himself on the wrong side not only of political ideo- logues and fanatics but also of religious dogmas and philosophical "schools" of thought. In the midst of the intense "dogmatomachy" of our age, Sandoz adds, Voegelin's attempt to recapture reflectively the experiential parameters of civilization made him in varying degrees "the adversary of all parties bent on success in the power struggle and the butt of their uncomprehending and uncaring obloquy when he would not be recruited to their causes." Distrust of foundations or foundational truth-claims, however, does not place Voegelin into the camp of agnostics or "value-free" empiricists. Ever since his vindication of metaphysics in The New Science of Politics, Voegelin's work has stood as a challenge and counterpoint to all forms of positivism, re- ductive immanentism, and anthropocentrism. In fact, his emphasis on tran- scendence and the "beyond" sometimes approximates his writing to contem- porary counter-discourses stressing rupture, radical "decentering," and "alterity" or heterology. Some passages in the new volume evoke the thought of Emmanuel Levinas-a writer not cited in its pages-particularly his con- ception of the imperative "call" of otherness. "The experiences of divine, for- mative presence," Voegelin writes (p. 97), "are events in the metaxy of ex- istence, and the symbols engendered by the Parousia express divine reality as an irruption of ordering force from the Beyond into the existential struggle for order." On other occasions, the volume's formulations carry overtones of negative or dialectical theology -though without any fixed doctrinal commit- ments. This is especially the case in the distinction between the "divine Beyond" and its manifestation or parousia in experience. "The imaginative language of the gods," we read, "can express the presence of reality beyond its presence, but the symbolized Parousia of the Beyond does not dissolve the Beyond into its Parousia in the experienced tension." Thus, even when the</page><page sequence="13">Voegelin's Search for Order 423 divine reveals itself in symbols or in living encounters, "it remains the un- revealed divine reality beyond its revelation." Philosophically, Voegelin's arguments sometimes bear a resemblance to the depth exegesis articulated and practiced by Ricoeur and also to Gadamer's ontological hermeneutics. In many respects, however, his outlook seems to parallel most closely aspects of Heideggerian thought, especially the "funda- mental ontology" expounded in Being and Time-though there are no signs of overt "influence." Distinctly Heideggerian is the critique or decentering of subjective intentionality and the portrayal of human existence (or Dasein) as participant in the disclosure of being. Already the opening pages of Order and History developed this broadly "existentialist" theme, in opposition to purely spectatorial or epistemological postures. "Man, in his existence," we read there (1956, pp. 1-2), "participates in being"-and this not in an optional manner as if it were an engagement "he could as well leave alone"; instead, "man's partnership in being is the essence of his existence, and this essence depends on the whole, of which existence is a part." Despite its traditional vocabulary (essence-existence), the passage evokes Heidegger's claim that Dasein is that mode of being for which "being" is the central question. Sim- ilarly evocative are references to the "anxiety of existence" and the attack, in a later volume of Order and History (1974, p. 186), on the "subject-object di- chotomy" which is said to be "modeled after the cognitive relation between man and things in the external world" but does not apply to the "event of an 'experience-articulating-itself." Other themes familiar from Being and Time are the notion of "historicity" and the proposal of a "destructive" reading of traditional doctrines, predicated on the recurrent need for resymbolization of decaying symbol systems. Regarding the former notion, In Search of Order points to the close correlation of modes of temporality in the course of onto- logical participation (p. 74): "The participatory story, if remembered in the present of existence, expands into the story of its past and future as the story of the relation between its 'presents'. . . I suspect that the much-discussed problem of 'historicity' has found, in Hesiod's Remembrance, an analytical symbol difficult to improve upon." Affinities or resonances of this kind, however, are not restricted to the pe- riod of Being and Time, but extend to later Heideggerian themes. Thus, the comments Hesiod and Parmenides recall Heidegger's rehabilitation of "poetic thinking" and his exegesis of pre-Socratic texts-although for Voege- lin, Plato remains the paradigmatic classical philosopher. The story of West- ern metaphysics from Parmenides and Plato to the present is presented by Voegelin largely as a move from participation to "self-assertion," or from par- ticipatory to "activist consciousness"-an account which resonates with Heidegger's focus on the growing prominence of subjectivity and human tech- nological mastery over nature. In light of the so-called "overcoming" of meta- physics, the observations in the new volume on the development of philos-</page><page sequence="14">424 Fred Dallmayr ophy from Plato to Leibniz and beyond deserve careful attention and scrutiny (pp. 79-84). Equally suggestive and worth pondering are passages carrying overtones of an "ontic-ontological difference"-as, for instance, the statement that the metaxy expresses the experience of existence as located at the inter- section or in the "Between" of thing reality and "Beyond-reality." Particularly striking are formulations reminiscent of some of Heidegger's later key thoughts, such as the "fourfold" (Geviert) and the "appropriative event" (Er- eignis). Thus, reflecting on the Platonic categories of Nous-Psyche-Soma and Being-Becoming-Space and their mutual interconnections, Voegelin notes (p. 92) that "we might arrive at tetradic complexes." At another point (pp. 100- 102), the same conclusion is reached with regard to a particular feature of the structure of "consciousness-reality-language" which in some way "forces us to think in the mode of thingness," this feature being the "third, or fourth, 'kind of being', that is, the chora, space." The construal of the cosmic creation story in terms of a pre-ontological happening or "gift" letting the world be ("es gibt") is intimated in Voegelin's comments on the "comprehending symbol- ism of a Beyond, the epekeina" and on a "cosmic reality in which the quest for the truth of its order is an event." In my view, some of the most intriguing and thought provoking passages in the volume have to do with the character and status of language in the broader context of the metaxy. Attacking the fashionable reduction of lan- guage to an informational system or an instrument of communication, Voegelin-as indicated-embeds language in the structural complex of "consciousness-reality-language." "There is no autonomous, nonparadoxic language," he insists (p. 17), "ready to be used by man as a system of signs when he wants to refer to the paradoxic structure of reality and conscious- ness." Like human existence, language shares instead in the precarious quest for truth which yields "luminosity" but not univocal cognitive propositions. At a later point in the study the ambivalent status of language is said to be lodged at the crossroads of the sayable and the unsayable, of speech and si- lence. In the pursuit of truth, we read (p. 103) that the questioner's language reveals itself as "the paradoxic event of the ineffable becoming effable. This tension of effable-ineffable is the paradox in the structure of meditative lan- guage that cannot be dissolved by a speculative meta-language." In its own way, language testifies to the intersection of the divine and the human, to the metaxy of immanent experience and its beyond: "In reflective distance, the questioner experiences his speech as the divine silence breaking creatively forth in the imaginative word that will illuminate the quest as the questioner's movement of return to the ineffable silence." In an unpublished manuscript entitled "The Beginning and the Beyond"-written some time before In Search of Order (and quoted by Sandoz, p. 10)-Voegelin underscores the non-instrumental character of language and its irreducibly revelatory quality. After commenting on successive historical symbolizations of spiritual epiph-</page><page sequence="15">Voegelin's Search for Order 425 anies, the manuscript arrives at a notion startling in the context of contem- porary linguistics: namely, that of "the sacrality of a language in which the truth of divine reality becomes articulate." III Having outlined some of the strengths and promising vistas of Voegelin's study, I need to add some qualifying remarks or afterthoughts-remarks in- tended not so much as stark objections than as questions or apprehensions congruent with the author's "questioning" disposition. First of all, in a minor key, I note issues of terminology or the chosen vocabulary. Here I find puz- zling mainly the centrality assigned to "consciousness" in a work championing ontological participation. Given the prevalent usage of the term, this central- ity seems to insert the study into the context of the modern "philosophy of consciousness" (or of subjectivity) -an outcome antithetical to Voegelin's on- tological concerns and (partially) forestalled by the distinction between inten- tionality and luminosity. Regarding the latter distinction, additional qualify- ing comments are in order. It is not so much from the vantage of a "concretely embodied consciousness" that reality assumes the quality of thingness or of an "object intended" but rather from that of a transcendental consciousness (in Husserl's sense). Conversely, the insertion of embodiment into an ongoing happening does not yield a reductive empiricism, nor a new trans-individual "subject 'reality' " of which consciousness would be a "predicative event." In these and other respects, Voegelin still seems to me too closely wedded to the "subject-object" dualism and its analogues or corollaries. Terminologi- cally confusing along similar lines may be the distinction between "thing- reality" and "It-reality"-particularly in view of Martin Buber's well-known juxtaposition of "I-Thou" and "I-It" relations (where It has the character of thingness). Moreover, used in tandem with the stability of the thing-world, "It-reality" readily acquires unwarranted connotations of compactness (a point to which I shall return). What surfaces behind these terminological quandaries is a more trouble- some issue beleaguering In Search of Order (and all of Voegelin's work): namely, the bent to think in dualities and (occasionally) to distend the ten- sional metaxy in favor of self-contained polarities. Dualisms of various sorts are a recurrent feature in the volume, as has repeatedly been noted before. Thus, in addition to the opposition between thing-reality and It-reality, we find the dichotomies of things and non-things, of intentionality and luminos- ity, of narrative and event, of order and disorder, immanence and transcen- dence, "thinkers" and "resisters." To be sure, recourse to dualities is not by itself problematic; however, to maintain a tensional structure, the poles of the structure must somehow interact or interpenetrate-which militates against their strict conceptual segregation. A case in point is the relation between things and non-things. For, if It-reality is not simply populated by non-things</page><page sequence="16">426 Fred Dallmayr (or nothing), and if it is supposed to manifest itself somehow in the thing- world, then thing-reality itself cannot simply be composed of reified objects- a consideration which throws into jeopardy the received conception of "things" or at least raises "thinghood" into a question. This state of affairs is obliquely recognized by Voegelin (pp. 103-104) when he refers to Plato's ar- gument "that 'the divine' cannot be discerned by itself alone, there is no par- ticipation in 'the divine' but through the exploration of the 'things' in which it is discerned as formatively present." To which Voegelin adds ambiguously: "The thing-pole of the ultimate mystery, thus, is not itself a 'thing' but a ten- sional kind of being, responsive to noetic order but imposing the mode of thingness on the Cosmos." Generally speaking, the volume would have ben- efitted from a more explicit discussion of "things" and non-things, of presence and absence in their relation to different levels of "reality." Short of this, one would have wished the author to adhere more rigorously to his own insight that "none of the single tensions, or any of their poles, is an absolute entity given to an external observer." These observations are directly relevant to the distinction between inten- tionality and luminosity, where the former relates to intended objects or things; they also affect the opposition between narrative and event-where narrative (obscurely) "refers to reality intended in the mode of thingness." Easily the most crucial, but also the most difficult and problem-laden distinc- tions are those juxtaposing order and disorder, truth and untruth, immanence and transcendence. Ever since the time of his earlier writings, Voegelin has tended to identify modernity with secularization and the latter with a progres- sive immanentism of worldviews. Reacting against the "immanentization of the eschaton," he stated in a letter of 1943 explicitly that the "decisive prob- lems of philosophy" are "problems of transcendence"-a view he maintained through the years. While valuable as an antidote to positivism, however, dep- recation of immanence is fraught with quandaries. If Plato's argument (cited above) is correct that "the divine" cannot be discerned separately but only through its formative presence in the world or the cosmos, then the dividing line between immanence and transcendence becomes blurred, giving way to a peculiar intersection. Phrased differently, formative presence or parousia must and can only happen on the level of immanence -where the latter is no longer simply the opposite of transcendence. Again, this state of affairs is ac- knowledged by Voegelin in some passages-which, however, tend to remain on the level of obiter dicta. Thus, although repeatedly referring to "external" things or to the "body" as an entity in the "external world," he admits at one point that terms like "external" or "transcendent" only make sense in connec- tion with something "internal" or "immanent." "Such terms as immanent and transcendent, external and internal, this world and the other world, and so forth," he writes (pp. 10-11), "do not denote objects or their properties but are the language indices arising from the Metaxy in the event of its becoming</page><page sequence="17">Voegelin's Search for Order 427 luminous for the comprehensive reality, its structure and dynamics. The terms are exegetic, not descriptive." These considerations also seem to apply to the opposition between order and disorder, truth and untruth, and likewise between (truthful) thinkers and resisters. By its very title, In Search of Order tends to place a premium on order or orderliness in contradistinction to disorder, chaos, or anarchy. This preference was still more prevalent in earlier volumes of Order and History, guided by the assumption that the "history of order" could be traced through clear developmental stages of symbolization (an assumption later seen as too simplistic). Even the new volume at points endorses a simple dichotomous scheme of preferences. "The quest for truth," we read (p. 25), "is a movement of resistance to the prevalent disorder; it is an effort to attune the concretely disordered existence again to the truth of the It-reality." At other points, how- ever, the complexity of the quest and the non-doctrinal status of truth disturb or disorient the preferential hierarchy. As Voegelin notes in his comments on the Timaeus (p. 99), the "paradox of order-disorder" seems to attach to "ex- istence in the mode of thingness." But, he adds, "if it attaches to thingness, can there be an order of 'things' free of disorder? Or would the establishment of true order require the abolition of 'things'?" The same disturbance affects the binary opposition of truth and untruth-where the quest for the former implies resistance to the latter-making room instead for a closer correlation of "formative truth and deformative untruth," as Voegelin admits in one in- stance (p. 37). Clearly, if passages of this kind are taken seriously, doubts arise regarding the clear-cut bifurcation between questioners and "deformers" (or resisters) or between "resistance to truth," on the one hand, and "agreement or disagreement about the optimal symbolization of truth experienced," on the other (p. 35). Struck by the polemical tone of the distinction, the reader may wonder apprehensively whether queries addressed at In Search of Order are liable to be branded a sign of resistance or else be admitted as legitimate questions in a broadly structured Socratic dialogue. The issue of order and disorder, of formation and deformation, is closely connected with the general philosophical problem of unity and multiplicity, of sameness and otherness-a problem which is at the heart of Plato's Ti- maeus. Not unexpectedly, the privileging of order over disorder is matched here by a similar set of priorities. In Voegelin's presentation, order is largely the work of the "It-reality," of the attunement of "disordered existence" to the truth of the beyond. Although recognizing the latter's non-thingly status -its nonidentity with any specifiable entity-the volume basically en- dorses the "oneness" of cosmos and order (thus encouraging at least implicitly its congealment into a stable-univocal "ground"). The notion of a possible plu- rality of "It-stories" is blandly dismissed as "senseless," with the argument that we experience only one "comprehending reality" beyond the mode of thingness (p. 29). At another point, the Platonic "cosmos" is explicitly con-</page><page sequence="18">428 Fred Dallmayr strued as unitary or holistic. "The paradigm of the zoon, of the living order of reality, is One," we read (pp. 95-96). "The phantasy of multiple 'worlds' is incompatible with the experience of the It-reality and, inversely, a reality which engenders a consciousness of itself both intentional and luminous can be only One." Accordingly, the Platonic cosmos is described as "monogenes," a perfect reflection of the "monosis" of the divine paradigm. Statements to this effect do not prevent Voegelin from introducing important qualifications, such as the qualifying remark that the oneness at issue here is "not numerical, but the experienced oneness of existential tension." More crucially, he ob- serves, oneness should not be confused with "monotheism" in a theological- doctrinal sense. "Can this oneness of divine reality, revealed by the fides of the one, comprehending cosmos," he asks (p. 98), "be truly symbolized by a numerically One God . . . ? Can the problem indeed be reduced to the gen- erally accepted, numerical cliche of 'monotheism' and 'polytheism'? Would the numerical cliche not reduce the One God to the same rank as his many more compact confreres and expose him to the same noetic questioning of his divinity as the others?" These considerations lead Voegelin to ponder a pos- sible tension in the divine, a distinction between the "god of the Beginning" and the "god of the End"-and ultimately to the thought of "an Ungrund, or a Gottheit beyond the God of dogmatic theology." Paralleling Plato's Timaeus, Voegelin's volume (despite its incompleteness) represents a unified-holistic structure-whose individual facets or details need to be viewed in light of its broader metaphysical-ontological concerns. One such facet which deserves at least brief attention is the treatment of prominent philosophers and leading figures in the history of ideas. In view of the numerous affinities noted above, the cursory allusion to Heidegger in the text-stressing his National-Socialist episode-seems unhelpful as well as ungenerous. Heidegger's thought, one should add, is placed by Voegelin in tandem with Marxian materialism or economism, with both variants being classified as overt deformations of truth: both the former's nationalist popu- lism and Marx's reliance on Produktionsverhdltnisse are portrayed as mere "games played with the symbol 'Being'," after that symbol had lost its status in the metaxy (p. 52). By comparison, however, references to Marx are more hostile and vituperative. Among the followers of Hegel, particularly the Left Hegelians, we are told, imaginary speculation progressively took the place of experiential reflection; in the end, questions concerning "the structure of the speculator's own consciousness" and concerning "the truth it embodied" were shunned and even prohibited (p. 50): "This last requirement, necessary to protect the speculative efforts against all-too-obvious questions, was raised to the rank of an explicit postulate by Karl Marx." The passage is not further elu- cidated in the text. However, the reader is familiar with the so-called "pos- tulate" under the label of the "prohibition of questions" (by Marx), a claim articulated by Voegelin in some of his earlier writings. Unfortunately, the al-</page><page sequence="19">Voegelin's Search for Order 429 leged prohibition is backed up there only by reference to a passage in Eco- nomic and Philosophical Manuscripts-a passage which does not in any way curtail or prohibit questioning but rather suggests that concrete questioning is possible only in the context of an existing world, not from an external Archimedean point (a view not too alien to a participatory ontology). As it seems to me, the claimed prohibition marks a descent into ideological polem- ics, into the very "dogmatomachy" from which Voegelin otherwise seeks to rescue us so valiantly. Among modern philosophers, none is discussed more extensively and also less judiciously (I believe) than Hegel. Perhaps it is the very proximity be- tween Hegelian dialectics and the "history of order" which prompts critical distancing in this case. My concern here is not to vindicate Hegelian philos- ophy in all respects, but only to caution against a simplified or reductive ex- egesis. Clearly, some of Voegelin's points are well taken, and deserve to be pondered by friends and critics of Hegel alike. This is particularly true of the project of "absolute" historical knowledge, a project in which every context or horizon would become rationally transparent and amenable to proposi- tional formulation. As Voegelin observes (p. 64), Hegel went astray in con- struing "being" as a subject that "unfolds its substance in the historical process 'dialectically' until it reaches its eschaton, its end, in fully articulate concep- tualization of its self-consciousness." With a focus on language, a similar ar- gument can be made (p. 103): that the "effable-ineffable" tension resists being resolved through a speculative meta-language "of the kind by which Hegel wanted to dissolve the paradoxic 'identity of identity and non-identity'." Be- yond this "absolutist" and meta-linguistic bent, however, Hegel's philosophy is too richly nuanced and circumspect to succumb readily to critical charges, especially charges of a polemical sort. Thus, the charge of an oblivion of "re- membrance" seems farfetched in the case of a thinker whose image of philo- sophical reflection was the "owl of Minerva." Similarly, the linkage of Hegel with the later "death-of-God" movement strikes me as implausible-given the metaphysical structure of his thought which has rightly been described as an "onto-theology." (The phrase "senseless sound" occurs in a passage nar- rowly tailored to questions of concept-formation.) The linkage with modern agnosticism is particularly puzzling in view of the simultaneous ascription to Hegel of a variety of speculative-pneumatic traits, including Protestant, neo- Platonic and "gnostic" leanings-the last term being most liberally used throughout the text (so liberally, in fact, as to obstruct careful exegesis). Easily the most dubious or questionable passages of the text occur in the section dealing with Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. According to Voegelin (pp. 55-56), Hegel was guilty of immanentizing human experience and of re- stricting the latter to "natfirliche Erkenntnis in its deformative application to the It-reality"-a restriction which perverted periagoge into a product of "self-assertive action"; simultaneously (and not very consistently), periagoge</page><page sequence="20">430 Fred Dallmayr or Umkehrung is also said to be the work of external compulsion, of a necessity operating beyond the range of consciousness. These claims, I believe, are un- tenable both singly and in combination. The stress on nattirliche Erkenntnis, first of all, neglects that Hegel's Phenomenology portrays the path of experi- ence as leading from "natural" to "real" or "absolute" consciousness, both stages or dimensions being modes of human consciousness. As depicted by Hegel, this path of experience-far from being smooth (or immanent)-is ar- duous and punctuated by a rupture; for this reason the path is also called a "path of despair" or a via dolorosa (and "real" consciousness the "golgotha" of experience). The rupture is thematized by Hegel as a "turning around of consciousness" or Umkehrung, and the latter is termed "our addition" (unsere Zutat)-not because it can be fabricated self-assertively, but because it cannot happen without our participation (a participation which consists precisely not in self-assertion, but in a kind of "letting-be," namely, in letting the parousia occur). At the same time, what propels or compels the Umkehrung is not some external power-and certainly not the "unconscious" force suggested by Voegelin (in a truly "grotesque" interpretation)-but the movement of real or absolute consciousness as it affects and undermines self-certainty, that is, the complacency of natuirliche Erkenntnis. As Heidegger writes, in his own exegesis of Hegel's "Introduction" (1970, p. 130): "Our contribution wills the will of the absolute." Thus, "the reversal of consciousness does not add to the absolute any self-assertive supplement on our part. Rather, it restores us to our nature or being which consists in our standing in the parousia of the ab- solute." To which he adds: "If the reversal as our contribution is the fulfillment of our essential relation to the absoluteness of the absolute, then our being belongs itself into the parousia of the absolute."
