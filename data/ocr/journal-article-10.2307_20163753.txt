Plato, Epinomis 987e V_&gt;/pPORTUNITIES FOR THE BROADEST ENCOUNTER between the Greek and Near Eastern cultures opened up owing to the conquests of Alexander the Great. The founder of the new epoch, "Al-iskandar Zu i-karnain," as he would one day be called in the East, himself became for a thousand years to come a favorite literary hero of Greek and non-Greek writers. He was written about by historians and poets, philosophers and rhetori cians, but perhaps the most impressive and weighty verbal mon ument to the son of Philip, who manifested in himself all the splendor and all the vanity of earthly glory, is the one we meet in ancient Hebrew literature of the Hellenistic era, namely, in the opening lines of the First Book of Maccabees: * This is the second part of a two-part essay. The first part, "The Opposition," appeared in the previous issue of Arion (7.1).</page><page sequence="2">2 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS After Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came from the land of Kittim, has defeated Darius, king of the Persians and the Medes, he succeeded him as king. (He had previously become king of Greece.) He fought many battles, conquered strongholds, and put to death the kings of the earth. He advanced to the ends of the earth, and plundered many nations. When the earth became quiet before him, he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up. He gathered a very strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and princes, and they became tributary to him. After this he fell sick and perceived that he was dying. So he summoned his most honored officers, who had been brought up with him from youth, and divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive. And after Alexander had reigned twelve years, he died. This laconically solemn "necrologue" was written around 135 B.c.60 by an unknown Jewish author who was moved by far from friendly feelings for the western conquerors. No help for it! Alexander, who consciously stylized himself in the spirit of the archaic might of Achilleus and the archaic shamanism of Dio nysos,61 who staged, in the manner of the best mythological pat terns, the sacred marriage of Hellas and Persia,62 this native of Macedonia, a semi-barbaric land, where Euripides wrote his song of Greek nostalgia for barbarism, the tragedy Bacchae,63 this starry king, who with an iron rod shepherded the pacified universe, appealed irresistibly to the messianic imagination of the Near Eastern peoples, and the Jews were no exception.64 They saw him with more or less the same eyes as the Deutero Isaiah, in his own time, saw Cyrus. Ever since the time of Plato, the Greeks had languished after Eastern wisdom and its "teaching gray with time."65 Now they could meet it face to face. What they met was not what they expected. Thus, if they had long known about the wisdom of Egypt and Babylon, it was only now that Greek philosophers and scholars became aware of the very existence of the mysteri ous Torah. In the time of the Persian wars, the inhabitants of</page><page sequence="3">Sergei Averintsev 3 Palestine, who came in the ranks of Xerxes' multinational army, had left a purely ethnographic impression: . . . Closely behind passed over a race of wonderful aspect; Strangely upon their lips the tongue of Phoenicia sounded; In the Solyminian hills by a broad lake their habitation; Shorn in a circle, unkempt was the hair on their heads, and above them Proudly they wore the hides of horse-heads dried in the hearth-smoke. So wrote the epic poet Choerilus of Samos66 at the end of the fifth century B.c. He could not have been interested in what thoughts lived in those heads protected by horsehide helmets. Semitic ("Phoenician") speech itself is presented here as a bar baric "barking" of aliens in a foreign land. Contrary to that, at the beginning of the third century B.c. Jews started to interest the Greeks as bearers of some mysterious teaching. They are constantly associated at that time with Indian Brahmins, who came into fashion just then owing to Alexander's campaign. Proud of their own spirituality, the Hellenes took the liveliest interest in learning about a different, exotic spirituality, and at first everything seemed similar to them: Indian "gymno sophists" and Palestinian hahamim. Megasthenes, a diplomat in the service of Seleucus Nicator who visited India between 302 and 291 B.C., admonishes his compatriots with the following observation: "All opinions on the nature of things uttered by the ancients were also proclaimed by those philosophizing outside Greece, partly in India by the Brahmins, partly in Syria by the so-called Jews."67 The thought about the relations between Indian and Jewish wisdom-loving adepts emerged and took root among authors of the Peripatetic school. "These people are descended from the Indian philosophers," maintained Clearchus of Soli, a disciple of Aristotle. "The philosophers, they say, are in India called Calani, in Syria by the territorial name of Jews."68 For another of the Peripatetics, Theophrastus, the Jews as a whole are "a race of wisdom-lovers,"69 and here the inquisitive and thoughtful author of the treatise, "Concerning the Laws," is</page><page sequence="4">4 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" already familiar with some specific features of Old Testament religiosity, though he stylizes them in a Greek intellectual spirit. Or perhaps this stylization should be laid to the credit of Theophrastus' Jewish informants? We do not know for certain whether at that time there were Jews capable of presenting the traditions of their own people to the Greeks in the Greek lan guage and in conformity with Greek tastes; but we may be prompted to reflect by the testimony of the same Clearchus, according to whom Aristotle (in the forties of the fourth century B.C.?) supposedly made the acquaintance of "a Jew from Coele Syria" who was "a Hellenic man not only in his language but in his soul," though apparently loyal to the religion of his fathers.70 It is absolutely impossible to prove positively that Clearchus' story is an anachronism.71 The Jew of whom he speaks lived in Asia Minor, where, even before Alexander's campaigns, a situa tion had been formed that anticipated Hellenism. Philosophically-minded Greeks were particularly struck and attracted at that time by Jewish monotheism. They had only just managed by an effort of philosophical reasoning to overcome mythological polytheism, when they discovered that there existed an unknown people who, following totally different paths of spiritual life, had done the same thing, and that, if one believed their legends, in time immemorial! Jewish propaganda was given the chance to present to the astonished Greeks the faith of Moses as a "pure" philosophical religion, or, in Kant's expression, "religion within the limits of reason alone" (related is not equated?Kant's "reason" and Aristotle's "nous" are non-coinciding entities). Of course, this was a philosophical quid pro quo. The Bible did not overcome naturalistic magism merely in order to make room for the abstract religious Espe ranto of the Platonists, Peripatetics, and Stoics. "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" did not resemble the "god of the philosophers and scholars." But this misunderstanding, which surfaced in the time of Clearchus and Theophrastus, was to have a long life. It will be relevant not only for the Alexandrian Jew Aristobulus (second century B.C.), who believed in the identity of the teaching of the Torah and the Platonic-Aristotelian doctrine, and not only for the Greek Numenius of Apamea (second cen</page><page sequence="5">Sergei Averintsev 5 tury B.C.), with his famous question: "What is Plato but Moses speaking Greek?";72 within the completely different intellectual situation of the modern age, a similar reinterpretation of Juda ism will be undertaken by such thinkers as Moses Mendelsohn and Hermann Cohen. Ecstasies over the "philosophical" mono theism of the Semites produced an oracle knowingly fabricated in educated circles, though not necessarily by the Jews, and in any case reverently received by the pagan Greeks, as can be seen from these verses quoted by the Neoplatonist Porphyry: The gift of wisdom has been grasped only by Chaldeans and Jews, Those who righteously venerate the existing God as ruler.73 Thus, in the first decades of Hellenism the attitude of the Greeks toward Eastern wisdom was one of extreme interest and respect. That is one side of the matter; the other was determined by the unexampled linguistic closedness of Greek culture. Facing the East, a Greek could show curiosity, solicitude, could con struct the most profound speculations and surmises, experience ecstasies; yet, practically speaking, to learn any of the Eastern languages seemed to him, in most cases, an unthinkable thing to do. The same Clearchus who speaks with such enthusiasm about the moral discipline (karteria) of his "Jew from Coele Syria," also complains in moving expressions that the name of the city of the Jews?"Hierusalim"?is extremely difficult to pronounce. Indeed, one must be a true Hellene to transform the foreign "Yerushalayim" into "Hierusalim," which clearly con tains the Greek root hieros and still find the resulting name woe fully unpronounceable! Was it not the same with Dionysius of Halicarnassus (first century B.c.), who lived in Rome, wrote about Rome, and admired the Roman state, yet refused in his History of Rome to mention the names of the Italic gods, so as not to defile Greek speech with foreign phonetics?74 As long as ancient Greece remained itself, it was fatally unreceptive to the beauty of foreign speech.75 With a Greek one had to speak Greek, otherwise he simply would not hear.</page><page sequence="6">6 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" The conditions of the game were firm. The peoples of the East who wished to deliver the treasures of their national wisdom to the Hellenistic world market of ideas were first obliged to put those treasures into the packaging of Greek verbal forms?and also, as far as possible, thought forms. The time called for translators. For a historian it remains only to be amazed at the speed with which the translators got down to business. The Babylonian Berossus, priest of Bel, belonged to the generation that had seen the times of Alexander the Great;76 he managed to write for Antiochus I Soter (281/80-262/261 B.c.), who in his cultural pol icy took a consistent course toward the revival of local customs,77 a work in Greek, in three books?his History of Babylon.7* He presented his account of the history of his ancient people as a universal chronicle, a form well known to us from the Old Testament but totally alien to classical Greece. The first book dealt with events from the beginning of time to the flood, the second brought the story down to Nebuchadnezzar, the third to the coming of the Macedonians. A great role was played by various sorts of real and fantastic chronological calculations: the entire temporal universe of history, which Berossus worked out as adding up to hundreds of millennia, was presented as a whole and divided into massive tiers of epochs. The Greek historio graphy of Herodotus and Thucydides did not know this chrono logical architectonics that worked with millennia. "So you have to begin all over again like children, and know nothing of what happened in ancient times either among us or among your selves," a memorious bearer of Eastern wisdom said to a Greek already in Plato's Timaeus.79 One can, of course, make fun of the fake chronography of the Babylonian historian, as F. F. Zelinsky did in his usual role as advocate of classical antiquity in its lawsuit with Asia: "Berossus was generous with zeroes. In its scientific content, Chaldean astronomy could hardly make a great impression on Greek sci entists . . . therefore their objections had to be crushed under the weight of numbers."80 However, the matter was not so simple. If a Greek of the classical period sensed only the present and the recent past as something real for him, that protected him from</page><page sequence="7">Sergei Averintsev 7 the pseudo-scientific charlatanism of chronological ecstasies, but at the same time it closed to him the opportunity of experiencing and of feeling in an open perspective the vast scope of time and the monumental rhythm of successive epochs. The brilliant Thu cydides did not give the slightest effort to making his chronol ogy more unified, thereby making the world's time more seeable, more visually apparent to the mind. Here the Hellene was poorer than the Eastern scholar, as Plato was able to see with greater insight than the eloquent philologist of the twentieth century. If the inner form of the Eastern world chronicle had not been urgently needed by the Greco-Roman world, it would not have been received by it so eagerly. Indeed, without its influence the universalist historiography of Posidonius and his followers, such as Diodorus, would have proved impossible, to say nothing of those chronological tables which, from the time of Julianus Afri canus, were the object of a veritable mania among the polyhis tors of the Christian camp.81 The seed sown by Berossus fell upon fertile soil. Babylon had a rival, however, that disputed with it over the antiquity of its national tradition?Egypt. The Egyptian priest and "hiero-scholar" Manetho made Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283-246 B.c.) the gift of a History of Egypt that began, like Berossus' history, with the time of the gods and demigods and closed, again, with the time of the latter-day demigod Alexan der. In general, the undertaking of the "hiero-scholar" from Seb ennyte is, in its basic task, fully analogous to that of Berossus. Flavius Josephus declares: "in Manetho we have one who was both a native of Egypt and also proficient in Greek learning. This is evident from the history of his nation which he wrote in Greek, a translation, as he says himself, from the sacred books, in which he convicts Herodotus of being misled through igno rance of many points of Egyptian history."82 For nearly two cen turies the Greeks had been satisfying their intellectual curiosity by repeating the stories of the traveler Herodotus?let them lis ten now to a native Egyptian who offered them first-hand knowledge of his country, but in their own language! It should be specially pointed out that the situation of Hellenism brought closer together not only the Greek and Eastern worlds, but also</page><page sequence="8">8 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS^ the separate Near Eastern nations, who had known about each other from time immemorial but now renewed their acquain tance. Manetho faced the necessity of responding to the biblical account of Moses and Pharaoh, and gave his own version of the events of the Book of Exodus from a national Egyptian point of view. Thus Moses, the pride of the Jews, turns out to be an apostate priest from Heliopolis named Osarseph.83 That should not surprise us. Under Ptolemy II Philadelphus, great numbers of Jews already populated the part of the city of Alexandria allotted to them between the eastern gates and the king's palace, enjoyed a privileged position there, and, one may suppose, greatly annoyed the Egyptians, who were oppressed to begin with,84 and at every Passover remembered the disgrace of Pharaoh and the exodus from "the land of Mizraim, the house of slavery." Precisely during the reign of Philadelphus and, ac cording to the traditional version, on an initiative from above,85 they undertook so grandiose a project as the translation of the Bible into Greek (the so-called "translation of the seventy," or Septuagint). It was possible to conceive and carry out this proj ect on the wave of that early Hellenistic impulse toward inter cultural synthesis which prompted the works of Berossus and Manetho. But such grandiose translation work as that begun by the Jews had never been contemplated either by the Babylonians or by the Egyptians. It is true that only the main part of the Jew ish scriptures, consisting of the Pentateuch or Torah and proba bly some other books, was translated immediately, around the year 250 B.c. By the middle of the next century it was possible to read the Books of the Chronicles; by 138 B.c., "the Law, the Prophets, and other books" (the first is evident from mentions by the Greco-Jewish author Eupolemus, the second from the quoted remark by the grandson of Ben Sira, or Jesus, son of Sir ach, in the prologue to the sayings of his grandfather). The Book of Esther, as the introduction to the manuscript of the Greek text tells us, was translated in 114 B.c. Soon the entire thousand year treasury of Hebrew literature existed in Greek: the unprece dented deed was done. The second birth of the Torah was an event of such signifi cance for a believing Jew, pervaded as he was by notions of the</page><page sequence="9">Sergei Averintsev 9 holiness of the very verbal and written flesh of the divine word, that his mind faced a choice: to see what had taken place as a sacrilege86 or as a miracle. The Jewry of that age preferred to see the Septuagint as a miracle, as a new manifestation of the revela tion. A legend was created according to which the translation of the Pentateuch was done by seventy-two scholars,87 each of whom went to his own cell and had no contact with the others. When (after seventy-two days had passed, as especially passion ate lovers of ^numerical mysticism added) they finished their work ancLeompared the results, it turned out that the texts of all seventy-two translations coincided word for word, thereby revealing their divinely inspired origin. For Jewish authors of the first century A.D. the Septuagint was authoritative "Scripture" {Graphe) in the full religious sense of the word. That implies serious shifts in the very spirit of Judaism: in the Hellenistic period and in the first decades of our era, that spirit was broader and more universalist than ever before or since. At that time belief in the imminent fulfillment of the promise given by Yah weh to Abraham?"And in thee all the nations of the earth shall be blessed" (Genesis 12:3; 22:18)?reached its apogee. In order to bring the law of Yahweh to the "gentiles" (goyim) and trans form them into "proselytes" (gerim), it was necessary to separate that law from the soil of Palestine and make it universally acces sible.88 The translation of the Bible into Greek, the universal lan guage of Mediterranean civilization, the language of the big cities, was the first step on that path. Only when the tragedy of the two Jewish wars (66-73 AD- and 132-135 A.D.) put an end to these universalist dreams, and rabbinic circles, abruptly locked into their national exclusiveness, had to dispute with the heirs of the Alexandrian universalists?the Christians89?did the attitude of orthodox Judaism toward the translation of the Septuagint abruptly change. In the Talmud the day when the translation was finished is likened to the dark day of the Old Testament?the day when the golden calf was set up.90 In the second century A.D. the synagogue made an attempt to replace the Septuagint with the more literal translations of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus, and later still renounced the very</page><page sequence="10">10 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" idea of hellenizing the Torah, remaining, this time for good, with the ancient Hebrew original. This attitude toward the Septuagint was not ungrounded. The translation of the Bible into Greek in itself predetermined a series of moments that further emphasized the universalization of Judaism. Jewish usage strictly vetoed the "four-letter" name of Yahweh, and therefore, in reading aloud, this kettb ("spel ling") was replaced by the qere ("reading") "adonai," meaning "the Lord." One way or the other, the revered and unutterable name remained in the text, a reminder of the exclusiveness of the worshipers of that name. But in the Greek translation it was omitted altogether, replaced in the written text by Kurios? "Lord" (hence the custom among Christian writers of calling their God simply "the Lord"). The name that sounded exotic to the Greek ear disappeared, and what remained was the idea of God as "the Lord" in general, the Lord not of the Jews but of the whole world. This highly portentous change was by no means the only one. As a Russian philologist has pointed out, "The LXX often do not so much translate as interpret."91 Of course, the freedom of the translation varies greatly in various parts: the sacred Torah is transmitted with greater reverence, the translation of the Psalms often goes off into retelling, and, fi nally, the Greek version of the Book of Daniel is almost a pure retelling, which results in an essentially new literary work. The translators wanted their work to make a vivid impression on the Alexandrian reader, whoever that reader might be, Hellene or Jew. This striving for clarity and visuality can be felt on the level of realia: the particulars of Palestinian life imprinted on the text of the Bible are systematically supplanted by the conditions of Hellenistic Egypt.92 The consistent replacing of the archaically anthropomorphic features of God, the preoccupation with not wounding Greek aesthetic sensibility with too strong images of Eastern fantasy, is very significant. Sacrifices could not be avoided here, and bold poetic expressions were often replaced by more colorless abstract turns of phrase (also caused by a certain quasi-philosophical intention on the part of the translators, which betrays itself par ticularly in their work on later parts of the canon). But as a</page><page sequence="11">Sergei Averintsev 11 whole the translation of the Septuagint ought to be recognized as an outstanding solution of an unprecedented literary task. With all concessions made to Greek taste, it recreates the special pitch of Semitic poetics, coarser but more expressive than the refined formal language of Greek literature. Syntactic parallel ism, so characteristic of the Bible, was quite familiar to Greek rhetoric, but here it was significantly more broken up, was as if shorter of breath; ancient Hebrew poetry worked with greater verbal masses, organized in free structures.93 The authors of the Septuagint managed to create a rather organic fusion of the Greek and Semitic language systems; their style is close to the colloquial phrases of the Hellenistic koine, and yet it invariably retains a sacral distance. From then on the path for creating in the biblical spirit, but in the forms of the Greek language, was open. The available stylistic forms, surrounded by a halo of holi ness,94 came in handy for the founders of Christian literature, whose style is filled to the brim with recollections from the translation of the "Seventy." There exists as profound a connec tion between the Septuagint and the genesis of Christian litera ture, as there does between question and answer, between premise and realization. We shall say more. Precisely through the Septuagint and its New Testamental reverberations there entered into the world of European languages?Greek, followed in the fourth century A.D. by Latin, then by the Romance, Germanic, and Slavic lan guages?for all the centuries of the Christian era, an endless flow of lexical "biblicisms," representing an echo of the ancient Near East in the speech of the West, without which it is impos sible to imagine European verbal culture. Only think that Shake speare would not have been able to speak of "glorious morning" in his sonnet, nor Akhmatova of "clouds in a glory of rays," if it were not for the Alexandrian translators who gave the lexeme "glory" overtones of the meaning of the Hebrew kbwd (the self manifestation of the divinity in fire, light, and smoke; see Exo dus 16:10; 24:16, etc.) which were originally foreign to the Greek doxa and the Latin gloria! But all this was only to be accomplished in the course of the two Christian millenia. Let us go back to antiquity and ask: Did</page><page sequence="12">12 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS the Septuagint reach the pagan reader, and such a reader as really felt himself at home in his paganism and was not driven from home into the ranks of Jewish or Christian proselytes by an exile's anguish? Was the Bible appreciated by the Greeks not merely as a religious document, the Law of the Jews, "conveyed by Moses in some mysterious scroll," in the mocking expression of Juvenal (14.106), but as a work of literature? If we recall the radical unwillingness of all true Greeks to acknowledge and appreciate aesthetically any literature except their own, and the far from "Attic" shape of the Septuagint, which was bound to shock the Greek connoisseur, as well as the general incompati bility of the Jewish attitude toward life with Greco-Roman aes theticism,95 we will not be surprised if the reply is negative. After all, even such adepts of classical culture as went through conver sion and baptism, like Augustine, were going to suffer greatly from the fact that the book in whose sacredness they believed was written in such a non-Demosthenean style! And yet we meet one exception, which represents such a his torical and cultural paradox that its unusualness cannot be over estimated. To dwell on it we will have to break the chrono logical order of our account and turn to one of the most mysteri ous books left us by classical antiquity: the anonymous treatise On the Sublime, attributed to the Pseudo-Longinus. This trea tise was written somewhere between the twenties and fifties of the first century A.D., an amazing period, when everything came to a crisis, everything seemed possible, and all boundaries were blurred and all doors opened (precisely during these decades Christianity was born in the East, and in Rome the tragedian Seneca, in totally non-classical words, prophesied the geographi cal ecstasies of the age of Columbus96). Greek literature was in a state of deep, obvious, black humiliation. Half a century later it would gradually emerge from that humiliation into the pride of the Second Sophistic, into the self-confident cult of culture in the spirit of Aelius Aristides and the Philostrati, of Libanus and Himerius. But at that time even the earliest protagonists of the "Greek Renaissance," such as Plutarch and Dio Chrysostom, were children or adolescents. What Greek writing from the first three-quarters of the first century A.D. has survived? If we do not</page><page sequence="13">Sergei Averintsev 13 count that lonely and unnoticed little book On the Sublime, which has occasioned our mention of the period, there is noth ing but the Greek writings of the Jews?Philo and Flavius Jose phus. To such an extent had everything turned around! If ever the self-conceit, self-satisfaction, and self-containedness of Greek verbal culture could have broken down, it was then.97 This does not mean that the author of the treatise On the Sub lime was not pervaded to the marrow of his bones by a passion ate veneration for Greek tradition. Homer, Sappho, Pindar, Sophocles, Demosthenes were his idols. Majestic antiquity, beside which the spiritual unfreedom of his own time became particularly evident, was sacred for him. But for him the vener ated heritage of the best time of the Hellenes was not the "clas sics" as understood by any "classicism" (which made one of its earliest appearances just then),98 not a collection of flawless samples of self-sufficient literaturizing, not the self-manifestation of "beauty," academically understood. He was attracted not so much by impeccable beauty as by boundless majesty. That is why, alongside the ideal of the "beautiful" (to kalon), long real ized and crystallized in aesthetic thought, he places another ideal, which he understands essentially as a corrective of the first: the ideal of the "sublime" (to hupsos).99 For us the term "sublime" is threadbare and easily associated with lifeless academicism, but for the Pseudo-Longinus it was precisely the opposite: to hupsos was that unbelievable element of life, those peaks and abysses of the spiritual world, which are too high and too deep to be fitted into the category of the "beautiful." The author of the treatise On the Sublime sought those peaks and abysses in his favorite Greek authors, but not only in them. For at 9.9, just after the analysis of a passage from the Iliad, we read: Thus too the lawgiver of the Jews, no ordinary person, since he had the capacity worthily to receive the divine power and show it forth, writes at the very beginning of his Legislation: "And God said ..." What was it God said? "Let there be light, and there was light," "let there be land, and there was land."100</page><page sequence="14">14 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" The unique significance of this passage cannot be diminished by the fact that the Pseudo-Longinus quotes the Book of Gene sis, as we see, not at all precisely and apparently without having the text of the Septuagint at hand when he wrote these lines. Let us even admit, as has often been done, that the quotation was borrowed at second hand (for instance, from the treatise of Cae cilius, whom he was refuting, according to the evidence of Suda, a believing Jew,101 or told to the author by Philo of Alexandria during the latter's visit to Rome in 41 A.D.102). It suffices that the lapidary biblical phrase, put into the forms of the Greek lan guage by the "Seventy," in one way or another entered the men tal horizon of such an impressionable Greek as Pseudo-Longinus and was aesthetically appraised by him as monumental and sig nificant, as a realization of the "sublime." In a certain sense, that appraisal may be called a historico-cultural misunderstanding: to hupsos, "the sublime," is much too Greek a category to be able to characterize adequately the inner cast and pitch of the biblical text, for there is too much aestheticism in it, too much of the cult of culture and the pathos of distance, which are totally for eign to the Bible. The Near Eastern attitude to the world lives by the antitheses of "life" and "death," "wisdom" and "vanity," "law" and "lawlessness," it distinguishes between sacred and void, important and idle?anything except the "sublime" and the "lowly." This last antithesis is posited only by a culture of the Greek type and loses its meaning outside it. Two things must be said in defense of the Pseudo-Longinus. First, we are dealing here with a misunderstanding of an extremely subtle kind, and not at all with a coarse and con tentless mental error. Misunderstandings of this kind are an all but necessary condition for understanding in the encounter of different cultures. If there were no view from outside that sees everything slightly differently than the view from inside, there would be no encounter. Second, this particular "misunder standing," which was revived in Europe with the revival of the classical norms of culture and aesthetics and came to life in the renaissance, baroque, and romantic poeticization of the Bible, proved not only extremely long-lived,103 but also of rare produc tivity, laying the foundation for a great cultural synthesis, within</page><page sequence="15">Sergei Averintsev 15 which the primal dynamics of the Bible quite appropriately sup plemented the balanced statics of the classical language of forms. Of course, this is all, in the words of a Russian poet, "the sur mises of a baffled Greek"104 (vis-?-vis the verbal shape of the Old Testament, a European is always more or less "Greek"); yet a mistake that was able to give birth to the poetry of Milton and Klopstock, Derzhavin and Blake, does not deserve too severe treatment. Besides, any transfer of a concrete historico-cultural phenomenon to the sphere of all-human, all-significant, universal values inevitably involves its alienation from its own concrete ness and calls for a portion of optical illusion. Such is the dialec tics of any "influence" or "mutual influence." It can be maintained, for instance, that the Romans had already hopelessly perverted the essence of the Greek classics, a wholly adequate understanding of which was possible only on Greek soil itself, and that in the subsequent millennia each new wave of Helleno phile enthusiasm (like the Goethean-Winckelmannian "neo humanism") imparted more and more alien features to the object of adoration. But it would be just as correct to say that only in the hands of the Romans did the Greek classics cease to be a "thing in itself," a function of local conditions of life, and become spiritualized, taking on the role of an all-significant cul tural reference point, and that all subsequent "receptions" have been degrees in this spiritualization. As Athens had to become "Athens," so Jerusalem had to become "Jerusalem" in order to play the role of a universal symbol in the constructive process of the formation of European culture. It is this constructive process that was pre-formed, in nuce, in the momentary event of the encounter of the two worlds, sealed by the words of the Pseudo Longinus. Perhaps in the name of pure historicism it would be better to forget this perspective of meaning, but there's nothing to be done?we remember it, and it makes us see historical real ity with different eyes. In the same perspective of meaning, we also see the attempts of Hellenized Jews to speak the language of Greek literature. True, these attempts yielded little that was whole and organic. Those authors who, in striving for a synthesis, did not stray too far from their native soil, certainly chose the best lot. An</page><page sequence="16">16 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" example is the well-known Book of the Wisdom of Solomon, written by an Alexandrian Jew just before the beginning of our era. Though the book is written in Greek and contains concepts that can be expressed adequately only in Greek,105 though it replaces the truly Jewish (Pharisaic) teaching about the resurrec tion of the whole man in the age to come by the Greek (Platonic) teaching of the immortality of the bodiless soul, which comes to dwell in the body and then is freed of its bonds,106 though its preaching is addressed not so much to the Jewish as to the Hel lenistic reader, anticipating the themes and motifs of Christian "apologetics,"107 it remains faithful to the genre of ancient East ern aphoristic literature cultivated by the hahamim (it suffices to compare it with the purely Palestinian Book of the Proverbs of Solomon, with which it is affiliated). One cannot help admitting that the anonymous Alexandrian scholar made a rather success ful choice of the literary sphere in which the synthesis of Judaic and Hellenic could take place most painlessly. There was noth ing in the whole of Jewish literature that was as cosmopolitan, as "worldly," as open to pan-Mediterranean influences as the aphoristic tradition of the hahamim. There was nothing in the whole of Greek literature that was so little specific to Hellenic tradition, and so connected with Near Eastern tradition, as the aphoristic manner of such "sages" and didactic poets as Solon, Theognis, and Phocylides. The distance between the Book of Proverbs and the exhortations of Phocylides can hardly be com pared with the abyss that separates Attic tragedy from the prophecies of Isaiah. So matters stand on the level of the history of genres. Taking things on a more essential level, though one less yielding to posi tive analysis, one must say that if there is an important similarity that shows through the contrast between Near Eastern and Hel lenic types of men, it consists before anything else in a particular predisposition to raptures of intellectualizing, to the view of "learning" as a value higher than all other values. In the face of wisdom, both "manly" military virtues and simple-hearted "soulfulness" retreat into the background: the man of the Near East and the Hellene both cherish things not of the soul but of the spirit.108</page><page sequence="17">Sergei Averintsev 17 Needless to say, the wisdom sought by the disciples of Socra tes and by the disciples of Rabbi Aqiba were two different things, in some way even opposites. But for the one as for the other, their "wisdom" is the object of an all-consuming passion, which determines their whole life, and he who possesses wisdom is for them the greatest, the worthiest man, who best fulfills his purpose. The Roman is impressed by the adult solidity of the practical man, who feels himself precisely too adult to remain an enthusiastic student till his dying day, breathing the student atmosphere, forgetting himself in mental exaltation. The imagi nation of the younger "barbarian" peoples is irresistibly affected by visions of fearless courage, strength, broad magnanimity. Next to a Roman, a Jew, a "Chaldean," or a Greek may look like an overeducated Wunderkind; next to a barbarian, a lover of physical strength and physical courage, he may look like an old man who has perceived the vanity of all strength and all courage, except for the strength of the mind and the courage of the spirit. In the Jewish treatise Pirqe Aboth ("Sayings of the Fathers") which appeared on Palestinian soil in the Roman period, we read: "Ben-Zoma said: ' . . . Who is mighty? He that subdues his nature; for it is said, He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city' (Proverbs 16:32)."109 For all the abyss between the Eastern scholar and the Greek philosopher, they are both people who devoted their lives to acquiring intellectual training. That is why the ecstatic panegyric to the Wisdom of God woven by the anon ymous Alexandrian author sounded so well in Greek: "For in her there is a spirit that is intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, clear, unpolluted, distinct, invulnerable, good-loving, keen, irresistible, beneficent, humane, steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating through all spirits that are intelligent and pure and most subtle" (Book of the Wisdom of Solomon, 7:22-23, [R.S.V.]). Does not this weav ing of words, in which the golden threads of Hellenic philosophi cal idealism adorn an Eastern fabric, already foreshadow the inner form of the Byzantine akathistos?uo In embracing Chris tianity, the Greeks will adopt this billowing of endless epithets, measured to the swinging of the censer, and having adopted it,</page><page sequence="18">18 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" "will bring it to perfection," as Plato boasted they always did with barbarian inventions. But the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon, as we have already said, is directly affiliated with biblical genres (it was not for nothing that the Christians quite rightly treated it as a canonical book, a legitimate part of Old Testament tradition111). Much less successful were the experiments of the preachers of Judaism with the genres that belonged specifically to Greek literature. It is difficult to treat these experiments otherwise than as curiosi ties. They are the fruit of a "pseudomorphosis," which almost always occurs when the achievements of one cultural world are hastily and superficially adopted by another. Even tragedy? probably the most Hellenic of all Hellenic literary forms, organi cally connected with Attic soil, with the cult of Dionysos, with the life of the Athenian polis?found an imitator among the scholars in the Jewish quarter of Alexandria. He turned out to be a writer with the resounding name of Ezekiel, "author of Jewish tragedies," as he is called by Eusebius (Praep. Evang. 28), owing to whose learned diligence we have at our disposal lengthy excerpts from a tragedy entitled Exodus, written, in all proba bility, in the second century A.D. Since Ezekiel's experiment is of interest as a unique historico-cultural curiosity, and is also little known, we will quote several fragments from it. The plot of the tragedy follows the narrative of the Book of Exodus. It is clear, therefore, that it can have no unity of time or place. It begins in Egypt. Moses, following the best Euripidean example, delivers a prologue: Ever since Jacob, leaving the land of Canaan, Went down to Egypt with seventy souls and there Fathered also a people great in number, Destined to suffer pain and tribulation, Mistreated even to this present hour By wicked men and tyranny's strong arm . . . Seeing our race indeed grown beyond measure, Pharaoh, the king, did then contrive against us A great ruse: some he overwhelmed With weighty bricks used for his constructions,</page><page sequence="19">Sergei Averintsev 19 While towns he fortified for the ill of others. Then did he decree that the male children Of the Hebrew nation were all to be drowned In the deep waters of the river's stream. There follows an account of the life of Moses himself, who was thrown in a basket to the mercies of the Nile and fished out by the Egyptian princess. Then the action moves to Midian, where the hero is forced to flee after killing an Egyptian. There he meets his future father-in-law, Jethro, and converses with him. And it is there that he is deemed worthy of seeing the Burn ing Bush. Moses Oh, what wondrous bush is it I see, A marvel inconceivable to mortals? The bush is all wrapped round in flaming fire, And yet the leaves and branches are intact. What is it? Closer let me contemplate The marvelous vision; the mind can scarce believe it. God Stop, do not venture to approach so boldly, 0 Moses, with your sandals still untied. Know that this place is filled with holiness, The divine word is speaking from the bush. Take heart, O child, and listen to its speech. Being a mortal man, you may not look Upon my countenance, but these my words Amidst this desert place you may still hear. 1 am the God of your own forefathers, The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; Remembering them, and my long-standing mercy, I have come now to aid the Jewish people, Beholding the oppression of my servants. Set out upon your way, proclaim my word First to the Jews themselves, to all the nation; Then to the king of Egypt give my orders, To lead the people from this foreign land.</page><page sequence="20">20 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" Moses But forceful eloquence is not my gift: Tongue-tied, I mumble incoherently? Can I raise my voice before the royal throne? God You shall send Aaron, then, your own blood brother, First telling him exactly what I say, And he will stand before the royal throne: To you he is to listen, as you to me. What hold you in your hand? speak out at once! Moses This is my rod before which quadrupeds cringe.112 God Throw it down and quickly draw aside: It will transform into a wondrous dragon. Moses Oh, what is this I see? Have mercy, master! How terrible, how frightful! Oh, I beg you, Spare me! My knees give way from fear. God Be not afraid, but now stretch forth your hand And seize it: it will turn back to a rod. Needless to say, the tragedian Ezekiel is no match for his Old Testament namesake! But we cannot read this strange work without remembering that it is precisely here that the path begins which leads to Milton's Samson Agonistes and Racine's Esther and Athalie. The Alexandrian translators did not resolve what was for them the insuperable task of making a synthesis of "Athens" and "Jerusalem." Let us be grateful to them for having posed the problem. It was for European culture to resolve it, and that by its whole existence.</page><page sequence="21">Sergei Averintsev 21 notes 60. See W. C.

In 324 B.C. the public celebration of an unprecedented wedding took place: Alexander and ten thousand of his soldiers were united with Persian maidens (Plutarch Alex. 70). Hellenism was symbolic of the male principle, barbarism of the female, and the destiny of the universe demanded their coupling in the mys teries: such symbolism was still understood by the novelist Heliodorus (third or fourth century A.D.). 63. "It is as if the renewed contact with nature in the wild country of Macedo nia, and his re-imagining there of the old miracle story, had released some spring in the aged poet's mind, re-establishing a contact with hidden sources of power which he had lost in the self-conscious, over-intellectualized environment of late fifth-century Athens," observes E. R. Dodds in the introduction to his edition of The Bacchae of Euripides (Oxford i960), xlvii. 64. In Jewish legends Alexander comes out as a pious worshipper and defender of the true faith, enjoying the protection of Yahweh and the zealous support of the Jews. See F.

It is, of course, possible to doubt the genuineness of Clearchus' fragments, though there is not sufficient basis for doing so. T. Reinach (Textes d'auteurs Grecs et Romains relatifs au Judaisme [Paris 1895], 12 n. 1) does something else: he recognizes the genuineness of the text, but doubts Clearchus' truthfulness. He argues that, as it is hard to imagine a Jew in the time of Clearchus who truly</page><page sequence="22">22 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" comprehended Greek culture, such a figure is altogether unthinkable for the years when Aristotle was staying with Hermius of Atarnea. But what do we know of Hellenism seeping across the border of Artaxerxes' empire around 347 B.C.?

The old suggestion that this passage is an interpolation by an Alexandrian anti-Semite of a later period (see Reinach [note 71], 29 n. 29) has insufficient grounds. Apparently, the name Osarseph originally referred to the biblical Jo-seph, for it is the result of the replacement of the element "Jo-," "Iao-" (i.e., "Yahweh") by the name of the Egyptian deity "Osar" (i.e., "Osiris"). 84. The Egypt of the first Ptolemies was nothing like the Babylon of the first Seleucids. Up to the reign of Ptolemy IV Triphonus, native Egyptians were so deprived of rights that they were not even allowed to serve in the army. 85. According to the account in the so-called Letter of Aristeas, the king's librarian, the famous Demetrius Phalerus, produced a memorandum in which he pointed out to his king the lack of the books of Hebrew scripture in the library of Alexandria and their linguistic inaccessibility (Epist. Arist. 28-33), after which Ptolemy Philadelphus himself supposedly sent a request to the Jewish high priest in Jerusalem, the result of which was the appointment of a college of translators. Aristeas' letter is a priori a literary stylization, which must neverthe less be considered Hellenistic, though not as early as the third century B.c. (see the preface and notes to Aristeas to Philocrates, ed. and trans, by Moses Hadas [New York 1951]). Though the evidence of this pseudo-writing cannot be relied on, it lets us know how Alexandrian Jews imagined the history of the Septuagint a century or two after the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus.</page><page sequence="23">Sergei Averintsev 23 86. Islam, which has great typological resemblance to Judaism, resisted for a very long time translating the Koran into the Persian or Turkish languages (see I. P. Petrushevsky, Islam v Irane v VII?XV vekakh ["Islam in Iran in the Seventh to Fifteenth Centuries"], [Leningrad 1966], 121). It is enough to recall the revolu tionary significance of the work of Luther, who translated the Bible from the sacral Latin into profane German, in order to imagine that in the third century B.C. such an event must have stirred people's minds at least as much as in the six teenth century A.D. 87. This version was first told in the Letter of Aristeas and was then embel lished with further legends by Jewish and later by Christian authors, occasion ally running into criticism (as, for example, in St. Jerome, Preface to the Pentateuch in Migne, Patrol. Lat., vol. 28, col. 150). One Jewish version speaks of five translators. The number seventy-two (that is, six men from each of the twelve tribes of Israel) was one of the favorite numbers in Jewish religious life; we meet it in the Old Testament (the number of men chosen by Moses for sacral functions) and in the New Testament (the number of Christ's apostles). The Latin Septuaginta means "seventy," the rounded-off version of the same number. 88. There is a story in the Talmud about the famous Hillel (d. ca. 10 A.D.), inspirer of the universalist trend in Pharisaism: "A goy came to Hillel; Hillel con verted him to the Jewish faith. He said to him: 'Whatever is hateful to you, do not do it to your neighbor. That is the whole teaching of the Torah, the rest is commentary. Go and learn!'" (Sabbat 31a). 89. In some Byzantine authors (for instance, Eutychius of Alexandria) we find a very strange and thus all the more characteristic legend, according to which the God-bearing Symeon of the Gospels (Luke 2:25-32), to whom it was promised that he would live to see the birth of the Messiah/Christ, was one of the seventy translators and lived no more or less than three hundred and fifty years. A co author of the Septuagint who waits for the birth of Christ in order to see his hopes for "the light to enlighten the Gentiles" fulfilled, is a very expressive sym bol. For Christians of the New Testament period, the Septuagint had already fully replaced the Hebrew text of the Old Testament. It serves to this day as the canonical text in the Greek Church. 90. Soferim 1.7 (the day was 8 Tebet). On the other hand, the Talmud does allow for the reading of the most sacred Jewish prayer, "Hear, O Israel!" which contains a confession of monotheism, in all languages, including Greek (Sota 33a; Megilla 17b). 91.

The "rivers of waters" mentioned in the Book of the Prophet Joel (1:20) do not exist in Egypt. In the Greek text they are replaced by apheseis hudat?n, i.e., the "canals" so familiar to every Egyptian. The "keepers of the door" from the Book of Esther (2:21) are replaced by archis?matophulax, official title of the head of the guards at the court of Ptolemy. 93. See E. Norden, Agnosthos Theos: Untersuchungen sur Formengeschichte religi?ser Rede (Leipzig 1913), 355-64. 94.

"There will come an age in the far-off years when Ocean shall unloose the bonds of things, when the whole broad earth shall be revealed, when Tethys shall disclose new worlds and Thule not be the limit of the lands" (Medea 5.374 79, in Seneca, Tragedies, vol. 1, trans, by F. J. Miller [Cambridge and London 1938], 260-61). As we know, this passage inspired the seafarers in the Age of Discovery. 97. In this period, Greco-Roman (especially Roman) society proved to be quite open to Jewish propaganda, among other things. Anyone who reads the dialogue between Horace and Aristias Fuscus (Horace, Sat. 1.9.60-69), will be unable to rid himself of the impression that at least a very superficial interest in the Jewish faith was fashionable in the early decades of the Empire and almost a necessary attribute of "the best houses" in Rome (see also the society quip from Augustus' letter, quoted by Suetonius [Aug. 76]). Undoubtedly Dornseiff exaggerates greatly when he portrays Horace and Virgil as experts in the Septuagint and Horace specifically as the son of a Jew or a proselyte (Verschmachtes zu Vergil, Horaz und Properz [Berlin 1951], 65 and passim), but his observations on the role of ludaica in the general picture of the interests among high society in the time of Augustus (67) cannot be entirely dismissed. This situation definitively turns into its opposite only in the time of the Antonines. If for Horace an admirer of Jewish customs was his sort of man, the object of light, quite friendly irony, for Juvenal (14.92-106), he was an enemy of society, a seditious alien and renegade. 98. The Atticism ripening in the first century B.c., with its efforts to find a canon of normative rules and authoritative models, was precisely classicism, and Caecilius, with whom Pseudo-Longinus polemicized, stood on quite classicistic ground. As Wilamowitz once observed: "The Greek classical poets had long been classical when Cicero and Horace were schoolboys"; and the notion of the "classic" (born of necessity at a certain moment from the entire concept of litera ture as we have tried to describe it in the first part of this article) and the phe nomenon of "classicism" are correlatives and are unthinkable without each other. If a post-Romantic lover of literature, while resolutely rejecting "classi cism," holds to the idea of the "classic," it obviously means one of two things: either the idea of the "classic" is far less essential and indisputable in his mind, far less clear and distinct than it seems to him, or his break with the classicist norm is far less profound than it seems to him. The metamorphoses of classicism have been many since the time of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and it is unlikely that we have seen the last of them. The end of classicism can only coincide with the definitive overthrow of the Greek concept of "creativity"; whether that is possible is not for historians of literature to decide. 99. As we know, it was not the Pseudo-Longinus who introduced the term "sublime." However, on the lips of his antipode Caecilius the term obviously referred to some different category. 100.

We remain Europeans, and consequently "Greeks"; the ability we have acquired, in culturological reflections, of taking distance from ourselves, of "looking at our selves from outside," does not yet mean that we are indeed "outside" ourselves. 104. [The quotation is from the poem "Theme," first in the cycle "Themes and Variations," by Boris Pasternak. ? Trans.] 105. Take even the assertion that God "created the world out of formless mat ter" (ex amorphou hul?s), which better suits the Demiurge from Plato's Timaeus than the Elohim of the Book of Genesis (Wisd. Sol. 11:17)! The special terminol ogy of the Stoics also plays a very great role in the vocabulary of this book. 106. The soul is thought of as existing before its embodiment: it "comes" into the body, and it alone is the man's "I" (Wisd. Sol. 8:20), while the body is merely the "earthly tent" of the spirit (9:15). 107. An enormous place is taken up in the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon by appeals to realize the senselessness of serving idols. The whole book is struc tured as a speech of admonishment from the "righteous" King Solomon to the "rulers of the earth" (1:1)?that is, to his pagan counterparts. 108. One cannot help lamenting the fact that the words "spirit," "soul," and their cognates, are too emotional and blurred, too poorly distinguished in mean ing, to be able to fulfill their function?not as terms, to t?e sure, but as intellec tual symbols. (In German, schooled by its philosophical tradition, Geist and Seele are much more clearly opposed, so that L. Klages's formula, "spirit as the adver sary of soul," might well bewilder a Russian reader, while being perfectly trans parent and even banal for a German. Vergeistigt and beseelt are antithetical in German; in Russian the two merge into the one word odukhotvorenniy ("inspired," "spiritual"). Nevertheless, we shall venture to use these words, attempting to clarify their meaning as we go. The element of "soul" in modern European (particularly German and Slavic) poetry is what decidedly keeps us from identifying poetry and rhetoric, and even prompts us to think of them as incompatible. The Greeks, however, identified them (when a Greek philoso pher? not a poet! ? attacks rhetoric, as Plato does in his Phaedrus, he denounces it not for its "sense," which interferes with the soul, but for its sense lessness, which interferes with the spirit). Rhetoric is simply the substance of all Greek poetry as a whole, not excluding its highest peaks. When we read the Greek poets attentively and without partiality, we are struck by the incomparable nobility of their spirit, yet we feel an almost physical hunger for "soulfulness" ? or, more often, we force it upon the texts. But the "warm-heartedness" of the Psalms and the Book of Job (the word "heart" is mentioned 851 times in the Old Testament and is one of its most important symbols) also should not be confused with our "soulfulness." Eloquence, which has its specific features in the Bible, different from Greek rhetoric but no less "dry" and "sensible," may be used as a touchstone here. Precisely in the Book of Job, the fine exigency of verbal form, the wittiness and sharpness, the taste for argument, competition, and sarcasm, reach their utmost and have a veritable feast-day. That does not interfere with</page><page sequence="26">26 "LITERATURE" AND "WRITINGS" "warm-heartedness" (just as the pure rhetoric of Byzantine church poetry does not interfere with it), but it leaves no room for "soulfulness." 109.
