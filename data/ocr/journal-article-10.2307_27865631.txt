<plain_text><page sequence="1">Helena A. van Bemmel, 1994. Dvarapalas in Indonesia; Temple guardians and acculturation, 1994, xvii + 249 pp. Rotterdam: Bal kema. [Modern Quaternary Research in Southeast Asia 13.] ISBN 90.5410.155.5. Price: NLG 135. JOHN N. MIKSIC As Dr. Nandana Chutiwongs notes in her Foreword, the statues of temple guardians are by design striking and impressive images. They were symbol ically meant to exclude invisible evil influences from the temple compounds, and psychologically they no doubt instilled additional piety into the wor shippers who dared submit themselves to their gaze. Dr. Chutiwongs then poses the question of the extent to which the attributes of these statues were determined by convention as opposed to individual artistic creativity. As Van Bemmel notes (p. 58), experts also differ on whether changes in South Indian dvarapala depictions had any symbolic significance, or were purely stylistic. This book does an adequate job of classifying these images, and provides an excellent survey of their architectural, symbolic, geographical, and historical context. Questions of cultural theory receive less attention than do standard concerns of the art historian. Chapter One begins with the obligatory consideration of cross-cultural con tacts. The author approaches this problem from the standpoint of the concept of 'acculturation', here defined as 'change under the influence of another cul ture' a definition adopted from a 1964 source. Other interpretations of cul tural change have arisen during the intervening thirty years. This book does not challenge the theoretical assumptions of what is now a previous genera tion of scholars. Readers should not expect a reconsideration of the question of Indianization such as that recently undertaken by R.L. Brown in The dvar avati wheels of the law and the Indianization of South East Asia (Leiden: Brill, 1996). On the other hand, it should be said that this book contains a rigorous, thorough, competent application of standard art historical methods to a well defined and important topic, and the data thus summarized and explicated</page><page sequence="2">326 Book Reviews can be put to use by other scholars and applied to such theoretical topics as the precise nature of Southeast Asia's artistic development, and the internal relations between various Southeast Asian cultures. Since the range of data collected is sufficiently comprehensive, and the underlying theoretical assumptions do not bias the data, the book must be accounted a worthwhile addition to the literature. This volume suggests several avenues for comparative research. In par ticular, it would be interesting to examine the direction of evolution of dvara pala in Chinese Buddhist temples. North Indian art was influential in China between the fifth and eighth centuries. As in northern India, Chinese dvara pala of this era had one hand in abhaymudra, while the other either rested on the hip, or held a club and staff. At Bharhut (100-80 BC), Kubera already appears as a dvarapala. In Tang-dynasty caves in western China, Kubera sometimes appears as a door guardian (painted, rather than sculpted). Much more frequently, however, one finds Manjusri and Samantabhadra fulfilling this function. The sixth-century Gupta Buddhist cave temples at Maharastra, such as Ellora, utilize bodhisattva as dvarapala: Avalokitesvara on the right, Manjusri or Maitreya on the left. Interestingly, in Indonesia Candi Mendut is unique among Buddhist shrines in displaying something similar to the Indian and Chinese practice: carved beside the entrance are images of Samantabhadra and Sarvaniviskambin. Pre-nineteenth-century Bali is excluded from this study due to the strin gent application of the condition that only in situ dvarapala can be used for analysis, whereas Bali contains no such examples. Thus a potentially import ant source of information is not exploited despite the potential for enlighten ment which the images there still possess. Even in Java, the number of dvara pala images still in situ is very small. Some loose Balinese dvarapala are used as comparative material, however. In India, naga and yaksha images were carved to guard entrances in torana (gateways) and vedikas (railings). The oldest in situ date from the first centu ry BC. By the second century, in Maharastra, naga and yaksa dvarapala are found in rock-cut temples. When stone temples began to appear, during the Gupta period, in South India dvarapala were placed at the entrances to the main shrine {garbha-grha), at entrances to mandapa, and at gopura in outer walls. The dvarapala in constructed buildings usually assumed human form, unlike those in the earlier stupas and rock-cut temples. The naga dvarapala appeared in Sri Lanka quite early, for example at Abhayagiri. Although it is known that Abhayagiri influenced Central Javanese architecture, especially at Ratu Boko, this form of dvarapala seems to have had no impact on Indo nesia. Four-armed deities, river goddesses, yaksha, and anthropomorphic fig ures in military or royal attire were some of the other alternatives available in India. Thus Indonesians must have employed some specific criteria to</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 327 select their motifs from among the vast quantity available in South Asia. What these criteria were still remains to be elucidated, but studies such as this one are beginning to point out ways in which such criteria might even tually be isolated and extracted from the mass of data which is gradually accumulating. An interesting difference marks the treatment of dvarapala in Buddhist as distinguished from Hindu architecture in Indonesia. In Javanese Saivite com plexes of AD 730-1300, dvarapala are always found in the form of pairs of standing figures carved in high relief set in niches beside the entrance to the main shrine. In Buddhist complexes, kneeling dvarapala in the round (rather than standing figures in relief) were placed at the entrances to compounds; in the late classic period, they were also positioned at entrances to interior courtyards. At the beginning of the ninth century standing dvarapala are also found in either high relief or shallow niches at entrances to Buddhist shrines. 'With a few exceptions, however, these standing Buddhist figures do not appear to have been specifically designed as dvarapalas' (p. 7). According to the sixth-century Brhat Samhita, the bottom quarter of the jambs of doorframes should be decorated with dvarapala. Other texts, such as the Agni-Purana, specify that deities named Nandin (also called Nandi swara) and Mahakala should accompany the river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna at the doors of Sivaite mandalas. These texts then give specific attributes to Nandiswara and Mahakala. None of these texts appears to have been used specifically as a guide by the designers of the Javanese dvarapala. After the ninth century no Buddhist shrines in Indonesia have relief dvarapala with the single known exception of Bahal 1, Padang Lawas, North Sumatra. Standing dvarapala, carved in the round, and the kneeling type in the round, are found in all complexes after the thirteenth century in Java, and possibly even earlier in Sumatra. Even an inclining dvarapala type appears. Makara and kala framing entrances 'can be considered to have a dvarapala function' (p. 7). Only those which are clearly distinct from types framing niches or windows are dealt with in this book. Significantly, these occur mainly where the motifs were not used at niches (for instance, in Sumatra and East Java). The author comes to very specific and somewhat surprising conclusions regarding the precise origins of the Indonesian dvarapala motifs. She believes, for example, that the kneeling and sitting dvarapalas in Indonesia may derive from friezes of dwarfs or ganas found as early as the first centu ry BC in both Hindu and Buddhist contexts. Similarly, a seated dwarf-like fig ure carved nearly in the round found in Ravana Phadi Cave, Aihole, Karnataka, 'is probably the most likely source of the first kneeling dvarapala carved in the round in Indonesia' (p. 13). While both these hypotheses are plausible, the specificity of the models postulated, and the gap in time</page><page sequence="4">328 Book Reviews between the appearance of the model in India and the presumed derivation in Indonesia, should be discussed. It would also seem that the Orissan ex amples (discussed on pp. 17-18) of differentiated standing guardians which appear in the sixth or seventh centuries, with those on the right possessing benevolent aspects and those on the left more demonic, might equally be considered as more proximate possibilities. According to Vinnot (cited on p. 31), standing male dvarapala pairs only become differentiated in India in about 750. By 900 they had lost their differentiated characters (p. 32). Another possible party involved in the origin of the Indonesian dvarapala are the early western Chalukya temples of Karnataka, South India. The Chalukya ruler converted to Sivaism in 660. Around the same time images of Agastya and a young man, supposedly the rsi who spread Sivaism in South India, appear and are used as dvarapala. For a short period in the mid-eighth century, the Chalukya adopted the use of Nandisvara and Mahakala as dvarapala from North India. The Indonesian scholar Poerbatjaraka suggested that the Indonesian Nandiswara/Mahakala pair developed from a slim Agastya and Ganesha. Van Bemmel argues convincingly (p. 36) that the Calukya provided the direct models for Nandiswara/Mahakala. Around 730 AD. at the entrances to the first definite Sivaite sanctuaries (Dumar?ay 1986), it was probably a pair of rsis who were the first dvarapalas, and also the propagators of Sivaism. Subsequently, the more crystallized pair of Nandisvara and Mahakala were depicted as the guardians of the entrance. The Calukya have similar examples for both pairs [and by implication are the most likely sources for the Javanese examples too]. Only five dvarapala pairs are still located in situ in Central Java. One of these, at Gedong Songo, includes a figure on the right who carries an Indian as cetics' waterpot in his left hand. He also wears a caste cord, necklace, ear rings, and bracelet - attributes of Agastya. At Lara Jonggrang, one of the dvarapala carries a flywhisk. This presents a striking contrast with India, where no dvarapala carry flywhisks. In Indonesia, flywhisks were used by ascetics, whereas in India they were used by royalty, and were never con nected with Siva. Furthermore, Indian regulations say that one of Nan disvara's main attributes is a club, but he never carries this weapon in Indo nesia. Nandisvara in Indonesia has more ascetic attributes. In India, snakes are used to suggest that dvarapalas possess a Sivaitic nature; this motif is not employed for this purpose in Java (p. 45). All this data is interesting raw material which could be exploited in order to obtain a more detailed under standing of the ways in which Indonesian artists utilized South Asian motifs in order to convey Indonesian messages. In Chapter Four, 'Development of dvarapala in South India, influence on</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 329 Indonesia, le BC - 10c AD', the author concludes that Indonesia drew on three different South Indian models for her dvarapalas, which were made in dif ferentiated (complimentary) pairs: a Pallava type, a Chalukya type, and a Chola type. But this three-model system, as she notes, is insufficient to describe all the examples found in Indonesia. Thus she is forced to create numerous interstitial categories. For example, one group of '[f]ull-frontal fig ures, feet slightly apart, one hand on the dagger or sword, and the other on the club' does not fit easily into any of these three categories. In order to resolve this problem, the author suggests that 'these standing figures can per haps be related back to Pallava examples, with possible influences from Chalukya and Pandya' (p. 62). Furthermore, the dvarapala in kneeling posi tion found in Buddhist sites during the Early Classic, and in Sivaite sites of the Late Classic, cannot easily be linked to any of these South Indian ideal types (p. 64). Another subgroup, comprising non-differentiated standing dvarapalas, cannot be connected to any Indian types, but parallels can be found in Vietnam and Cambodia. This complicated and somewhat uncertain hypothesis demonstrates how hard it is to create a typology for these artifacts, and to link them to specific Indian sources. The typological approach is necessary in archaeology and art history, but sometimes the number of categories created to fit a certain group of artifacts is so big, with so few examples found in each category, that the usefulness of the effort is diminished. Such a phenomenon seems to lead to the conclusion that Javanese sculptors possessed a great deal of freedom to create and adapt, a conclusion which can also be drawn from other categories of classical Indonesian art. The diversity of references in Indonesian sculp ture to various parts of South Asia suggests that the main conclusion to be drawn is a very general one: that Indonesians knew a lot about many parts of India, not just one or two; they were not dominated by, or restricted to, just one or two contacts. When we come to Late Classic dvarapala, the situation is if anything even more complex. The author defines six groups based on geography (Central Java, Malang, Blitar, Kediri, Surabaya, and Lawu) and compiles lists of vari ous attribute states. The sequence of teeth, for example, has nine different possible variations; hairstyle, 12; noses, 11; eyebrows, 4; snake ornaments, 7; and skull ornaments, 6. This set of data is quite valuable. Van Bemmel then analyses this data using Vogler's chronology of the monsterkop, or 'kala head', based on tooth sequence, as a possible linked set of data, but without much success. The traits which seem to be of use in separating kala heads into types with some chronological validity seem to combine in different fashions for dvarapala. Some dvarapala in Blitar and Surabaya, for instance, have a com bination of sideways upper fangs associated with central Javanese kala, and lower fangs associated with cast Javanese kala (p. 86). The hairstyles of dvara</page><page sequence="6">330 Book Reviews pala show few links to kala heads except for the floral hairstyle of a kala from Kalicilik, but the comparison here is with dvarapala of Gambar Wetan which are a full hundred years later. Neither noses nor eyebrows provide any mean ingful bridges between the art of the kala sculptures and that of the dvarapala carvers. A survey of dvarapala or dvarapala-like sculptures from Cambodia and South Vietnam (Champa) yields yet more variation, but little clarity. There seem to be many distinctions, but no real differences, in the sense that all the images seem to perform much the same functions despite a wide diversity in form. Many paragraphs in this section of the book give the impression of being little more than summaries of reading notes. What, for example, is the significance of the fact that snake ornaments appear in Champa but not Cambodian dvarapala, while Cambodian dvarapalas rest their attributes on ground, which the Cham examples never do? These comparisons beg for fur ther analysis. Kneeling dvarapala in the round, resembling many from Indonesia in this respect, only appear in Cambodia. In Indonesia, no standing dvarapala were carved in the round before 1300, whereas the Cham already had this type by the end of the ninth century. Kneeling dvarapala are common in Indonesia, sporadic in Cambodia, and there is one example in Champa. One can mar shal this evidence to draw the conclusion that that Late Classic Java was influenced by Champa and Cambodia (p. 107); in historical context, however, this chain of events seems very unlikely. It is more probable that what is being observed in these cases is no more than random stylistic variation, without any substantial external causation. The book's final conclusion once again demonstrates the author's aversion to attributing much originality to the Indonesian sculptures: Foreign frameworks (southern Indian, southern Vietnam, Cambodia) initially determine the form and the place of the Indonesian dvarapala, both stylistically and chronologically. In the subsequent process of acculturation local develop ments gradually began to play a more significant role. (p. 129) It seems strange that the quality of the carving is never mentioned. In this respect Indonesian dvarapala, particularly those of Central Java, stand out from all others. This characteristic alone should be considered a signal of originality. In fact, many other arguments could be advanced to support the conclusion that from the earliest period Indonesians were impressing their own conceptions upon the (admittedly imported) idea of the temple guardian. One should also consider the hypothesis that the prehistoric ances tor figures found in various parts of Indonesia prefigured the dvarapala, and predisposed the Indonesians to certain preferences for dvarapala styles and</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 331 locations. This book contains no reference to the common Indonesian prac tice of erecting guardian statues at villages, for example in North Sumatra. Why should Indonesians have imported ideas from other parts of Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Champa) during the periods when these civilizations were in terminal phases of cultural and political decline, while Indonesia was experiencing culturally fertile periods? This book does have some very strong points. It provides a good survey of the data, thanks partly to the author's significant degree of familiarity with India, and a thorough and systematic review of the many Indonesian images belonging to this category. It also provides a sobering indication of the speed at which Indonesian temples are being despoiled. The catalogue of dvarapala statues lost in recent years is an impressive, sad testimony to the problems of archaeological preservation in Indonesia. Other strengths of this book consist of thorough description and data col lection, but leave room for more theoretical studies. Future scholars can exploit the data contained here to pursue research along lines laid down by Robert Brown in the work mentioned above. The focus on 'acculturation', here defined in terms of the dissemination of motifs, seems to have hindered the author of this work from making more progress in that direction herself. In earlier decades it was assumed that links between art styles demonstrated the diffusion of influence, even people. This assumption is no longer preval ent. Most art historians would agree that this information is relevant, but for other purposes than those of simply charting connections. New paradigms emphasize such concepts as cross-cultural flows of information, and com munication processes, rather than assuming a simple one-way transmission of ideas. One could also ask why seemingly rigid differences, which have no connection with the specific religious imagery of either religion, are found between the Indonesian Hindu and Buddhist dvarapala. How did the evolu tion of the dvarapala in other parts of the world, such as Cambodia or China, differ from that in Indonesia, and why? Further analysis of this material can also be accomplished by employing such techniques as seriation and analysis of variation, to determine which attributes may be valid to use in the formation of typologies and chronolo gical stages. The author does not specify whether she is claiming that her typology is 'found' - that is, is assumed to correspond to some mental struc ture in the minds of the sculptors, as opposed to being created by the art his torian herself for heuristic purposes, without any assumption that the origi nal sculptors would have recognized it. As an example of the type of insight which might be obtained from such an inquiry, one can observe that Indonesians do not seem to have formulated concrete rules about what was a dvarapala and what was not. One can however observe that over time, the dvarapala image evolved in the direction of increasingly pronounced differ</page><page sequence="8">332 Book Reviews entiation of dvarapala by nature, while the number of attributes used to depict dvarapala decreased (p. 43). Phrasing this observation in another way: standardization increased. This obviously tells us something about the gen eral nature of stylistic variation in this artifact type, and by inference about the socio-political situation in Indonesia too. Indeed, one could say that in this as in other matters, the Indonesians employed an Indian artistic vocabu lary to express certain local statements. The differences between India and Southeast Asia themselves become keys to decoding certain messages, couched in terms of assumptions regarding the rightful place of these icons in a larger cosmography. In general, the style of the translation from Dutch to English is adequate. There is one noticeable flaw: the word 'pendant' is often used where the English term 'companion' would be correct. This mistake seems to be due to a misunderstanding about the overlap in meaning between superficially sim ilar Dutch and English vocabulary; due to the subject matter of this book, it occurs frequently. In summary, while this is a useful book, it does not preclude further advances in the analysis of this form of artistic expression. New discoveries are certain to require revision of the ideas presented here. For example, the Suaka Peninggalan Sejarah dan Purbakala in West Sumatra recently obtained a bronze image about 15 cm high from the west coast of the province, which portrays a standing dvarapala in late Classic style. The discovery of this image raises yet more complications for anyone seeking to create a valid typology for these multi-variate objects.</page></plain_text>
