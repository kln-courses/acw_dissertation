<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICALIST PANEXPERIENTIALISM AND THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM* George W. Shields / Kentucky State University Introduction Charles Hartshorne's arguments for the position that he has deemed "psychicalism" or (earlier in his career) "objective idealism,"1 or what I will call here "physicalist panexperientialism (hereafter PPE)," have great relevance to contemporary debates on the mind-body problem, debates which are at the very center of contemporary analytic metaphysics and philosophical commentary on cognitive and neuroscience. If Hartshorne's arguments are correct, the perspective of PPE offers a genuine, much needed advance forward in the currently moribund mind-body debates. In his recent treatise Unsnarling the World-Knot? David Ray Griffin has made the case for this point of view in a systematic way, relying at some junctures on Hartshorne's classic and still powerful essay on "The Compound Individual."3 In this paper, I want to provide a critical exposition of a few of Griffin's key points and arguments (which are mainly responses to criticisms), while filling in some relevant areas not emphasized by him (for example, I will discuss at greater length what might be called the "ordinary language problem" * An earlier version of this paper was presented at the "Invited Symposium on Hartshorne's Contributions to Current Research Programs," Philosophy of Religion Session III, Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Religion Southeast, Atlanta, Georgia, 11 March 2000.

Moreover, I intend to couple this with a presentation of some of Hartshorne's (and others) best arguments for PPE. The overall effect of these arguments, I submit, should be the following: (1) There are some very strong positive reasons for holding that PPE is, at the very least, strongly plausible. (2) I do not see that any objection to the theory (at least as reviewed here) is strongly plausible. (3) Consequently, the position appears to be "least paradoxical" and "most theoretically economic" among its competitors. Put another way, the cumulative force of the positive arguments and the respective difficulties of reductive materialist and dualistic theories point precisely in the direction of physicalist panexperientialism. Before beginning this task, a quick word on terminology and a brief definition seem in order: Charles Hartshorne has long championed the view he termed "panpsychism" earlier in his career and later "psychicalism." This shift in vocabulary was occasioned by his realization that the continued use of "panpsychism" was much too often causing his position to be associated with the metaphysics of German idealists such as Lotze and Paulsen, who held that any macroscopic entity you please has psychological properties?a point of view expressly rejected by both Hartshorne and Whitehead. More recently, David Griffin has introduced the terminology "panexperientialism," and more specifically "physicalist panexperientialism," as a label for the Whitehead Hartshorne position, the latter expression being employed in order to underscore the agreement with physicalist ontologies in their assertion that all genuine individuals have a physical aspect (or aspect of space time extension).4 I will follow Griffin's usage here. What is PPE? Briefly and roughly stated, PPE is the view that each genuine active individual (1) has some extension in space-time and (2) grasps or takes account of or prehends data in its past environment. PPE observes the fundamental logical distinction made by Leibniz between genuine active individuals or singulars and aggregates or swarms of such active singulars. Thus, rocks and pens are aggregates of atomic singulars and as such are no more centers for or subjects of experience than a flock of geese as flock may be so regarded. Another way of expressing the essence of this position is to say that each genuine individual has at the very least internal relations 4 Griffin, UWK, 3, 78.</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 135 with its past environment. For Hartshorne, this holds from electrons to God. Now, in the first section of this paper, I want to present two positive strands of argument for this position, based on or suggested by Hartshorne's writings, which I think are extremely powerful and insufficiently appreciated. The first strand of argument follows a kind of reduction to absurdity strategy (more precisely, it is a reduction to "pragmatic absurdity" strategy): If we assume the denial of PPE, in effect, if we posit the existence of genuine individuals which have only external relations with their environment,5 we must settle for a point of 5 That "the existence of genuine individuals which have only external relations with their environment" is the contradictory of PPE follows directly from Hartshorne's notion of internal relations. Hartshorne gives an interesting technical explication of G. E. Moore's definition of external relations when he connects it with C. I. Lewis's system of "strict implication," where "P strictly implies Q" if and only if "necessarily, it is not the case that and not-Q." Charles Hartshorne, The Divine Relativity (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1948), 95. Hereafter cited as DR: External is the negative of internal, and internal relations are ontological correlates of logical relations of "strict implication" or entailment. This seems to agree with Moore's definition. For that which the conception of a thing entails is that without which the entity could not be itself, the entity conceived. An internal relation then is the ontological correlate of a Lewisian strict implication, while an external relation is precisely not the ontological correlate of a Lewisian strict implication. This allows Hartshorne to see with great clarity that the logical notion of "independence" or "externality" can be modally construed as a relationship to open possibility, since internality or dependence is seen as restriction of possible alternative?necessarily not, without Q, if is internally related to Q. This insight undermines any absolute idealist's retort that an alleged "external relation to P" is itself a relation which necessarily involves as a term of the conceived relation. As Hartshorne puts it {DR, 72): ... the absoluteness [or externality] of [a] term ... is not, strictly speaking with respect to relation to [P], but with respect to a kind of relation, which can be defined, as logicians say, intensionally, or without mentioning [P]. Thus arithmetic</page><page sequence="4">136 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy view which denies certain "deep protocols of common sense" (by "deep protocols of common sense" I mean assumptions which we presume in our practice universally or nearly universally). Such denials are strongly paradoxical and thus high in cognitive cost. While there are philosophers who may be willing to embrace these paradoxes and pay the cognitive costs, I cannot be counted among them. The particular "deep protocols" to which I refer are the assumptions that (1) our experience as temporally conceptualized into "past," "present," and "future" is coherent; (2) the act of remembering is in principle not the same as the act of imagining; (3) causal influence is objectively real; and (4) a skeptical solipsism of the present is false. The second strand of argument contends that PPE neatly and economically avoids the major paradoxes of the two mind-brain relation theories (or groups of theories) which receive most of the attention from contemporary philosophers of mind: reductionist-materialist physicalism (in all its variations from central state to eliminative to functionalist versions) and dualistic interactionism. In the second section, I want to show that five major challenges to PPE found in the critical literature are rife with difficulties. PPE can thus claim powerful, systematic responses to each. It seems to me that such responses have not been sufficiently appreciated by either the theory's specific critics or the community of philosophers generally. Two Strands of Argument for PPE Let me begin by explicating with some precision the ramifications of the denial of PPE, that is, the ramifications of a pure external relations ontology. I will do this by undertaking a brief thought experiment set out in terms of (quasi-formal) possible worlds semantics: Let us stipulate a possible world W such that there is at least one entity which is "externally related" to all other entities in W (entities-other-than-x in W can be regarded as the set-complement of x). By parity of reasoning, the results we get concerning of W could be applied to any other entity of W stipulated to be externally related to is independent, not merely of my awareness of it, but of any particular awareness. Nothing is added to this attribution of independence by saying, "and also arithmetic is independent of my awareness."</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 137 the members of W. Now, to say that is externally related to its set complement in W is to say that would have all of its properties whether or not any member of the set-complement of in W existed or not. As such could not genuinely be a "part" of W, since, by definition of "externally related," is logically self-subsistent or could exist even if the entire set-complement of did not exist; so to speak, is W-context-independent. However, there should be nothing modally privileged about W (it is just an arbitrary possible world), and so long as is regarded as externally related to its set-complement in some distinctive possible world W1, would be W1 -context-independent, and so for W2, W3, and on and on ad infinitum. To halt this infinite regress, we would have to stipulate that is internally related to members of its set-complement in some possible world. As such only then does properly "belong" to a possible world. Of course, however, this would be just to deny the assumption with which we started, namely, the assumption of a purely externally related, logically self subsistent entity. The infinite regress of context independence would be halted in only one other way which would be by stipulation of the special case of a world W where comprises its sole member. However, in such case, the properties of would be strictly indefinable, since they could not be contextualized by any properties of any entities in W other than (by definition of the domain of W), and any other possible worlds by virtue of the possible world-context independence of x. In effect, using Hartshorne's felicitous phrase, a purely externally related entity would be a "sheer addition to reality as a whole."6 6 Charles Hartshorne, Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism (Camden, CT: Archon Books, 1964), 261, cited hereafter as MVG It might occur to some that an example of an entity which is logically self-subsistent would be God, and that the above Hartshornean thought-experiment shows only that, in a possible world where God existed and nothing else existed, God's properties would be independent of any possible worlds or world-states. Students of Hartshorne's writings know well what his response to this would be: Employing the dipolar distinction (or gen-identity/strict identity distinction), God's essential or gen-identity properties of omniscience, onmibenevolence, necessary existence, etc., are independent of possible worlds, but it doesn't follow from this that all of God's properties would be independent of the content of possible worlds or world states. For example, precisely how God's omniscience or perfect adequacy of knowledge is actualized depends on what possible world states to be known are actualized. Moreover, taking God as the</page><page sequence="6">138 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy What the above reflections show is that a purely externally related entity is completely arbitrary. Because it entails complete independence and lack of intrinsic connection or relation to anything else, such a conception allows for temporal arbitrariness, lack of all causal connection, and, what Andrew Bjelland has aptly called (following Santayana), "the skeptical solipsism of the present moment."7 These implications become clear when we examine historical representations of pure external relations doctrines in the atomist tradition from Hume to Russell. Thus, consider Hume's celebrated passage in A Treatise of Human Nature: Whatever is distinct, is distinguishable; and whatever is distinguishable, is separable by the thought or imagination. All perceptions are distinct. They are, therefore, distinguishable, and separable, and may be conceived as separately existent, and may exist separately, without any contradiction or absurdity.8 In light of this, it follows that percepts or events can logically come in any sequence whatsoever. It is as if the conjunction sign is logically value of in Wu would constitute a contradiction. As Hartshome points out famously in his paper on "Negative Facts and the Analogical Inference to Other Mind,'" The Radhakrishnan Souvenir Volume (Darshana International, 1964), a God who is purportedly "omniscient," but has no actual objects of cognition, could not in fact be omniscient. This is because the very notion of self-knowledge logically implies knowledge of the contrast "not-self," and knowledge of merely potential objects of cognition would not sufficiently ground any actual knowledge of others and would in effect represent a clear inversion of the ontological principle (i.e., the principle that the potential is always potential of some actuality). I add that recent theological experiments with Social Trinitarianism, whatever else we may say about them, acknowledge implicitly Hartshome's point about the necessarily social nature of any cognition. 7 Andrew Bjelland, "Evolutionary Epistemology, Durational Metaphysics, and Theoretical Physics: Capek and the Bergsonian Tradition" in Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time, ed.

Thus, Hume's rejection of any "rational" case for causal connection is, of course, no accident. It is not without interest in this context that Hartshorne and Peirce, both panexperientialists and advocates of the concomitant doctrines of de re causal connection and de re temporal asymmetry, argue that entailment or "illation" is logically primitive and thus that asymmetry and sequence are fundamental. Thus, we have Peirce's proofs (prior to Sheffer) of the truth-functional completeness of negation-disjunction and negation-conjunction which collapse into Sheffer's unitary stroke operators. As Hartshorne argues in his "The Prejudice in Favor of Symmetry," the defining power of logical operators varies inversely with their degree of asymmetry.9 Thus, Sheffer's stroke and dagger?the most asymmetrical of operators?can be employed to define any well-formed formula of propositional logic, while equivalence?the most symmetrical of operators?cannot be. Why should we get this result if Hume's "contingent conjunctions" model is in fact taken as logically fundamental? But Russell brings out the full flavor of the arbitrariness of external relations ontology with his notion that the hypothesis that the cosmos began five minutes ago is not logically impossible on atomist principles: There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago. Hence the occurrences which are called knowledge of the past are logically independent of the past; they are wholly analyzable into present contents, which might, theoretically, be just what they are even if no past had existed. Thus, what we call "the past" may well be an imaginary projection out of the present moment only.10 9 Charles Hartshome, Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method (La Salle, IL: Open Court, 1970), Ch. 10, hereafter cited as CSPM. 10 Bertrand Russell, The Analysis of Mind (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1921), 159-160.</page><page sequence="8">140 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy This undercuts any clear, principled distinction between past and present, and between the intentional acts of remembering and imagining, in a radical way. On Russell's Humean view, it is theoretically possible that every alleged case of memory is in fact not an act of memory, but of feigning. Indeed, what Russell doesn't go on to say, but his principles allow nonetheless, is that every present moment could represent an entirely novel universe from the perspective of each "present" knower. Thus, at one moment, I believe myself to be a college professor who attended graduate school at The University of Chicago; at the next moment, I am a professional football player who was tight end on my college team, and so on and on, each moment being "loaded," as it were, with a detailed false "memory." Bjelland nicely summarizes the result of these reflections as follows: The logic of external relations wreaks havoc with our temporal categories and renders our temporal concepts incoherent. In the end the logic of external relations, if consistently pursued, would issue first in a doctrine of sheer causal contingentism and ultimately in the skeptical solipsism of the present moment [illustrated above].11 Now, Hartshome wants to make the strong claim that a pure external relations ontology is logically incoherent in the strong sense that no possible world could contain purely externally related entities. He may well make the case for this on grounds that such entities are surds and are unknowable even in principle. However, the Hartshorne inspired argument I am presenting here makes the different claim that such a doctrine is "pragmatically impossible," that is, it maintains that the doctrine undercuts notions we constantly assume in practice willy nilly, come what may. However, in my view (as well as Hartshome's12), pragmatic considerations provide genuine evidence in 11 Bjelland, 65. 12 See Hartshorne's comments on pragmatism at CSPM, xvi. Also see Donald S. Lee, "Hartshorne and Pragmatic Metaphysics," in The Philosophy of Charles Hartshorne, ed. Lewis Hahn (LaSalle, IL: Open Court, 1991) and Hartshorne's reply to Lee, ibid., 714-721.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 141 adjudicating opposing philosophical contentions. Hartshorne's view that all genuine individuals have internal relations (or obversely that no genuine individuals have only external relations) makes possible all of the mentioned common sense protocols. But why should we rationally prefer a doctrine, even if it is logically possible, that undercuts such protocols? Now, there is another fundamental position to which PPE is opposed. This is the opposite of logical atomism, that is, monism. Here it is the reference to "genuine individuals" (plural) in the above definition of PPE that is denied. Mind-body monism comes in both idealist and physicalist forms. In its idealist version, say, ? la Bradley, Green or Bosanquet, the idea is that there is one genuine individual, not many, and this one or absolute is an unbroken continuum of experience. The whole universe is thus a tight chain of internal relations. In its physicalist version, say, ? la Gr?nbaum, the world exists as a tenseless, four-dimensional space-time continuum with events as world-tubes already mapped, so to speak, on the continuum. Our temporal experience is an illusion created by consciousness "crawling upon the [already given] world-lines," to use Herman Weyl's apt expression.13 Hartshorne has attacked the idealist version in numerous ways, for example:14 (i) by pointing out that a pure internal relations ontology is as extreme as a pure external relations ontology and will die the death of other such extremes; (ii) that, contra Bradley, our discourse about relations does seem to invoke a legitimate role for external relations, particularly when making sense out of temporal succession where past events are externally related to the present event (although the present event is internally related to the past); and (iii) that McTaggart's famous reduction of A-Series concepts to absurdity begs the question by tacitly presupposing that the future events to which his proof refers are as determinate and concrete as the past. Also, in light of the above logical syntax analogies, (iv) Bradley seems to take equivalence as most primitive as in his express notion that every entity is ground and consequence for every other and thus [(xRy) iff (yRx)]. Again, why should we get the result that asymmetrical operators have greater 13 H. Weyl, Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1949), 166. 14 Hartshome, CSPM, 61, 118; Hartshome, DR, 60-70; also see Hartshome, "The Neglect of Relative Predicates in Modem Philosophy," American Philosophical Quarterly 14 (1977): 309-318.</page><page sequence="10">142 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy defining power if Bradley's equivalence relation model is taken as fundamental? But the "knock out blow" against both15 versions of monism comes by way of an argument suggested by Milic Capek, an argument at least implied by Hartshorne in his assertion in Creative Synthesis that a temporalistic and prehensive model of mind-brain interaction is "most economical" in comparison with the alternatives of Cartesian dualism, parallelism, epiphenomenalism, etc.16 I expand upon Capek (somewhat liberally) to give the following argument: PI All partisans accept the notion of temporal experience as a phenomenological given. The words "past," "present," and "future" are communicable and intelligible, because we remember the past, experience the present, and anticipate the future. P2 Parallelism, which denies mind-brain causal influence of any sort, is inherently mysterious and arbitrary; it is an ad hoc solution to the paradoxes of Cartesian interaction. P3 All other models of the mind-brain relation posit at least sine qua non causal influence (and at least in the direction of brain to mind). P4 If a tenseless monistic ontology holds, then brain events are tenseless and are already present simultaneously somewhere on a continuum of being. 15 It may not be immediately clear how idealistic monism is undermined by the "Capek Argument," since such representatives as F. H. Bradley do not embrace the notion of causal influences between brain and mental events "when taken as real." However, the Capek Argument raises this issue for Bradley: how can the tenseless, static absolute experience give rise to even the illusion or appearance of "finite centers of experience"? This is much akin to the situation of classical Vedantic philosophy. Sankara regarded the question of the source of Brahman's "dreaming maycC to be forever rationally intractable. 16 Hartshorne, CSPM, 107.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 143 P5 If brain events are at least sine qua non causal influences upon conscious states, then conscious states should be tenseless, because brain events are. Either we must embrace parallelism (with all of its mystery) or we must reject the phenomenological givenness of temporalized experience.17 In other words, we cannot comprehend the "crawling of conciousness along world-lines," or in effect, understand how even the illusion of temporal experience could occur if we adopt a tenseless "block of being" ontology. The second set of arguments picks up again on Hartshorne's theme of the theoretical economy of PPE. One of the strongest positive arguments for PPE?and this is a central motif of Griffin's book?is that it simply does not raise the persistent problems of the two major competitors among theories of mind-brain relation, that is, Cartesian interactionistic dualism and materialistic monism. Indeed, the current situation in analytic philosophy of mind seems to be one of increasing recognition that current research programs have reached a dead end. To put it quite tersely, materialist programs have struggled especially with the issue of the emergence of consciousness, while dualist programs have struggled especially with the problems of mental influences upon the physical. Without a viable alternative in sight, Colin McGinn has thus summarily argued that "we will never resolve the mind-brain conundrum."18 And John Searle has regarded the attempts of materialist philosophers to save the materialist hypothesis as almost neurotically desperate: Criticisms of the materialist theory usually take a more or less technical form, but in fact, underlying the technical objections is a much deeper objection. . . : The theory in question has left out. . . some essential 17 See M. Capek, "Temporal Order and Spatial Order" in Mind in Nature: Essays on the Interface of Science and Philosophy, eds. John Cobb and D. R. Griffin (Washington, D. C: University Press of America, 1978), 57-58. 18 Colin McGinn, The Problem of Consciousness (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), see especially Ch. 1.</page><page sequence="12">144 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy feature of the mind, such as consciousness or 'qualia' or semantic content. . . . And this leads to ever more frenzied efforts to stick with the materialist thesis and try to defeat the arguments put forward by those who insist on preserving the facts. After some years of desperate maneuvers to account for the difficulties, some new development is put forward that allegedly solves the difficulties, but then we find that it encounters ... the same old difficulties.19 What is called for, writes Galen Strawson, is some novel "radical alternative" which is geared to providing "an adequate grasp of the fundamental nature of matter at some crucial general level of understanding."20 It seems to me that PPE offers that "radical alternative" with least paradox. I will try to show this by selecting a major problem with each mentioned competing theory which seems to be intractable, and then by showing how PPE circumvents those problems. A great trouble with any materialist theory of consciousness, long noticed in one manner or another by commentators on the Greek atomists, by John Locke in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Bk. IV, Ch. X), and by contemporary philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and John Searle,21 is the problem of how subjective, phenomenally qualitative states of consciousness could ever arise from material states that are by definition devoid of subjective, phenomenally qualitative properties. Reductionist identity materialists indeed hold that all mental states are "reducible" to physical brain states which are in turn "reducible" to microphysical states or constellations of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other atoms and their sub-atomic constituents. This means that under materialist descriptions of atomic entities, our conscious states are merely structural-quantitative states, a special positioning or location of bits of stuff having merely quantitative properties such as mass, charge, and spin. This seems completely absurd. In the last analysis, my experience of a patch of 19 John Searle, The Rediscovery of the Mind (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1994), 3. 20 Galen Strawson, Mental Reality (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1994), 92. 21 See especially Thomas Nagel, Mortal Questions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979) and John Searle, Rediscovery of the Mind</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 145 blue is qualitative and not merely quantitative or structural. As Hartshorne has put it,22 how can (reductionist) materialism ever bridge "the logical gap" between qualitative and quantitative-structural properties? Indeed, this so-called "problem of phenomenal qualia" and the apparent impossibility of physicalist reduction of qualia has moved some materialists to an even more radically absurd position, which is to eliminate consciousness, subjectivity, phenomenal qualia altogether. Says Paul Churchland, "If we do give up hope of reduction, then elimination emerges as the only coherent alternative."23 But this is hard to take seriously. If there are any facts, it is a fact that I experience blue and sweet and pains and tickles, etc. No such problem arises for PPE, because, by definition, it attributes subjectivity or interiority to atomic entities, or more precisely, to the actual occasions which constitute atomic entities. Indeed, the following are fundamental contentions of Hartshorne's philosophy:24 (1) There are no "vacuous actualities," no "bits of mere stuff." (2) The content of actualities is describable as a certain organization, contextualization, or synthesis of aesthetic qualia. And, (3) from this qualitative content, quantitative descriptions are made possible. Thus, subjectivity and quality do not somehow "emerge" as properties of conscious states, they are already present in the very building blocks of conscious states, which are the billions of actual occasions constituting the atoms which in turn constitute the neural occasions which in turn give out their prehensive data for the large-scale or dominant actual occasions constituting our moments of consciousness. It might be objected that this still evades the problem, because bits of subjectivity and qualia can no more give you a new whole of subjectivity than can bits of vacuous stuff. To use (partially) William James's classic analogy in The Principles of Psychology (James probably was aiming this at pantheistic experientialists like Royce, not "panpsychism" as such),25 if you take a dozen men and/or women and give them each a word of a coherent sentence and have them think the 22 Hartshorne, "Physics and Psychics: the Place of Mind in Nature," in Mind in Nature: Essays on the Interface of Science and Philosophy, 89. 23 Cited by GrifBn, UWK, 54. 24 Cf. Hartshorne, MVG, Ch. 8 25 William James, The Principles of Psychology, Vol. 1 (New York: Dover Books, 1950), 160. My discussion here is indebted to Griffin, UWK, 177-180. However, the counter-analogy is my own.</page><page sequence="14">146 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy word intently, you get no emergent consciousness of the whole sentence. But this objection would entirely miss the point of the doctrine of compound actual occasions. The large-scale or "regnant" actual occasions which constitute a series of human conscious states are precisely new, sequentially distinct entities which compound many antecedent entities of qualia. This compounding necessarily involves a qualitative intensification sheerly by virtue of the many which are prehended and also by the creative reaction of the new occasion to its prehended data (that is to say, every actual occasion is a synthetic contextualization of its prehended data by virtue of which it is a novel, distinct occasion discernible from others). In terms of James's analogy, PPE would require alterations in it such that a thirteenth person (analogous to a new regnant occasion) would be posited whose conscious experience was given content by the discrete words of each of the twelve to which the thirteenth person has access (analogous to the prehensions of the new regnant occasion). We would indeed then have a new consciousness of the whole sentence. Cartesian dualist interaction theories can avoid the problem of ontological reduction of the mental to the physical-extentional; indeed, by definition, they ontologically separate the mental and physical. But in doing this they create the intractable problem of making sense out of an entirely non-physical mode of causation. For dualism, while brain states causally influence mental states, the converse is also the case, mental states causally influence brain states. A severe problem arises here when we see that, for Cartesian theory, mental states are taken as the contradictories of physical-extensional states. The mental is precisely that which lacks extensional properties of mass, length, shape, etc. Mental entities are thus "abstracf'entities. But then how can such entities cause physical alterations? To use Jeflfry Olen's apt analogy,26 we can no more make sense of how Cartesian mental states can causally influence brain states, than we can understand how the square root of two could push a book (or even molecules of a book). PPE has no such difficulty, because, by definition, it is a physicalist ontology?for it, all occasions have extension in space-time. Indeed, Hartshorne makes much of the inadequate phenomenology of experience involved in the anti-physicalism of Cartesian theories (for sources, see footnotes 17 and 28). It is simply erroneous, Hartshorne 26 Jeffry Olen, Persons and Their World (New York: Random House, 1983), 216.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 147 observes, to claim categorically that mental states have no extension: pains, tickles, sexual sensations, warmth, tastes, smells and other mental qualia have approximate extensions measured along the sites of their sensory receptors. Thus, I do not regard my toes as the place where I am smelling the aroma of dinner, and a pain can extend for two inches on my arm. But surely at least thoughts do have abstract, non-extensional properties. Consider the following example: the sentential schema "x is round and weighs twelve pounds" makes clear sense when the value for is "my bowling ball," but does not make sense when the value for is "my thought." (The sense of absurdity would not change if the extensional predicates I provide accord with neo-cortext measurements of brain sites for thought and language processing.) The root of the non-extensional aspect of thought comes in to clearer view when we consider that thought has the property of intentionality. "My thought" in question is not itself something round which weighs twelve pounds, but rather is of something round which weighs twelve pounds. As such conscious thoughts are states which have, in Sartrean phrase, being for themselves. But this is precisely what an actual occasion is, in a manner of speaking, that is, an occasion is an actuality which becomes so because it has others for its very fabric; every occasion is V ?tre pour soi. Thus, regnant actual occasions constituting my moments of conscious thought already contain a social intentionality which transcends the mere physical location of acts of thinking. PPE then seems to be basically phenomenologically adequate. It embraces both the extensionality of feeling states and the intentionality of thinking states. Hartshorne argues this latter point with particular effectiveness in two essays on Husserl.27 The way out of HusserPs Cartesian solipsism as developed in Ideen I and the Cartesian Meditations, which yet at once fully captures the evident intentionality of consciousness, is to see that a full account of "experience of requires the positing of a content of the experience which is really independent of the experience. For, "no experience is merely Of that very experience, nor even 27 Charles Hartshorne, "Husserl and the Social Structure of Immediacy," in Philosophical Essays in Memory of Edmund Husserl ed. Marvin Farber (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1968); and Hartshorne, "Husserl and Whitehead on the Concrete," in Insights and Oversights of Great Thinl rs (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1984), Ch. 23.</page><page sequence="16">148 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy merely of an earlier moment in the same stream of experiences [it would then simply be indistinguishable from that earlier moment], nor can merely 'intending' an object that may not exist constitute the Of in 'experience of [because the projection of possibilities is grounded somehow in actual objects of experience]."28 For PPE, the whole move to epoche is entirely unnecessary as any dominant actual occasion involves the prehension of physical states, that is, the feeling content of the neuronic occasions. Contra Descartes and Husserl, any experience whatsoever is already an instance of contact with physical reality. Some Objections Considered Inow turn to the consideration of five objections to PPE which have been issued by the minority of analytic philosophers of mind who have commented on the theory. My discussion of three of these objections is indebted, as mentioned earlier, to Griffin's analysis (namely, the first, second, and fifth). I have added to the discussion by treating what might be called the "Ordinary Language Objection" and "Popper's Objection." (1) Panexperientialism is for some philosophers simply to be equated with the "classical panpsychism" of such post-Kantian German idealists as Herman Lotze and Frederick Paulsen wherein any macroscopic "thing" or "individual" is possessed of consciousness, is a center of experience. As Colin McGinn has put it, "panpsychism" entails the "scientifically and metaphysically outrageous" assertion that "rocks actually have thoughts."29 But this objection is especially weak as it simply has no application to the panexperientialist theory advocated by contemporary process philosophers, and on two basic counts. First of all, the Whiteheadian-Hartshornean version holds that not all experience is conscious experience. On panexperientialism, there can be low-grade sentience which is profoundly different in complexity from full-bodied consciousness (e.g., the posited sentience of neuronal occasions constituting a particular brain cell). Secondly, as Hartshorne has emphasized ad nauseum (but apparently to little avail), Leibniz had long ago introduced the proper distinction between genuine individuals and aggregates or swarms. Thus, rocks are aggregates of 28 Hartshorne, Insights and Oversights, 275. 29 Colin McGinn, The Character of Mind (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), 31.</page><page sequence="17">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 149 atoms and qua aggregates are insufficiently organized to have any sort of sentient or subjective states, much less "thoughts." However, the atomic entities which constitute rocks may be said to be constituted by occasions which have some extremely low degree of "sentience" or "openness to the environment." (2) Philosophers such as McGinn have asserted that "panpsychism" is absurd, because it entails that the behavior of atoms and sub-atomic particles would not be predictable through "their physical properties alone," something that McGinn claims "we know ... not to be the case."30 But this is at best a dangerously problematic assertion, if not altogether totally implausible, in the light of quantum theory. Quantum mechanics suggests just the opposite, namely, that physical information has intrinsic limits such that prediction of behavior can be determined only in the case of large statistical generalizations of elementary particles, not individual particles. This, of course, leaves room for the notion of elementary particles as partially self determinant. Thus, PPE is at the very least compatible with quantum theory. Moreover, current information-theoretic models of quantum mechanics directly imply that elementary particles process something more akin to semantic information than mere syntactical-bit information, and are thus strongly suggestive of protomental capacities of elementary particles.31 This suggestion holds for both the orthodox and revisionary Bohm-Hiley interpretations of quantum mechanics (according to which "active information" must be posited for sub atomic particles).32 In fact, the notion of "protomental matter" has become commonplace vocabulary of quantum physicists from B?hm to Wheeler to Wigner. (3) The response to McGinn above connects with Karl Popper's main objection to "panpsychist" and/or "protomentalist" theories of 30 Ibid., 32. 31 See William Seager's discussion of quantum mechanics in "Consciousness, Information, and Panpsychism," The Journal of Consciosness Studies 2 (1995): 272-288.

In his classic The Self and Its Brain,23 co-authored with John Eccles, Popper objects that elementary particles are "completely identical whatever their past histories" and thus they could not have any "interior" states. Consequently, panpsychist and/or protomentalist concepts of elemental entities have no discernible empirical content and are "metaphysical (in the bad sense)" as they thus have no discernible "explanatory power."34 However, this objection is riddled with difficulties. First of all, Popper has a very narrow conception of the "empirical content" of protomentalist notions of elemental entities. True, say, protons are not distinguishable in terms of direct experimental inspection of their physical properties. Any arbitrary proton has the same mass (938 MeV/c2), charge (+1), and spin (14) as any other proton P1. But it isn't true that protons just remain static in terms of their empirically discernible behavior over periods of time. For example, the proton in a tritium nucleus of hydrogen has a rate of radiation decay as compared to a proton P1 in a lead-206 nucleus (which has no decay) as is now familiar to us through the "half life radiation law." Using Hartshorne's helpful notion of "dipolarity," we might say that Popper is here conflating the gen-identity description of protonic occasions with their strict identity description, that is, the description which would demarcate just this sequence of protonic occasions with its particular features of radiation decay as opposed to some other sequence P1 with its particular stability or decay. Moreover, notice that the behavioral differences between and P1 are dependent on their physical contexts. Why should context matter for entities which are utterly closed to their environments (given Popper's view)? Perhaps more importantly (and Popper could not have known about any of this when writing The Self and Its Brain), the protomentalist concept has indirect empirical content by virtue of the phenomena of quantum holism and the result of the various EPR experiments undertaken since the 1980s. That is to say, if we assume that elementary particles are "open" to the influences of information transfer, and not merely so by virtue of light-cone propagation, we can more plausibly explain nonlocal data correlations of projected photons, correlations which can be altered by alterations in initial experimental 33 John Eccles and Karl Popper, The Self and Its Brain (New York and Berlin: Spring?--Verlag, 1977). 34 Ibid., 71.</page><page sequence="19">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 151 designs (e.g., changes in polarization orientations). Whatever controversies may be involved with the interpretation of these phenomena (e.g., whether they confirm the notion of instantaneous information transfer), it seems clear that they strongly favor a social and interactive interpretation of elemental entities very much in the spirit of Whitehead's denial of simple location. Indeed, mathematicians and physicists Robert Valenza and Granville Henry have recently proposed an (I think) effective solution to Young's two-slit photon experiment paradox which is based precisely on Whiteheadian assumptions of prehensive events and rejection of simple location.35 So much then, it seems to me, for Popper's claim of protomentalism's lack of empirical explanatory power. (4) Some analytic philosophers have rejected panexperientialism on the grounds that such Whiteheadian constructions as "feeling-tones" of atoms (and so forth) stretch language beyond its sensible limits. Indeed, if process thinkers reject the notion that "atoms think," then why not "atoms feel"? At least one philosopher has offered a "Wittgensteinian" critique of Hartshorne's panexperientialism precisely on this basis?a set of considerations which is close to Nagel's worry about "panpsychism": "if one travels too far down the phylogenetic tree, people gradually shed their faith that there is experience there at all."36 Bryant Keeling argues that Hartshorne's use of the term "feeling" when speaking of atoms is out of accord with the use of that term in its ordinary contexts and thus constitutes a serious misuse of words. Specifically, "the thing which is said to feel must be capable of observable behavior which is very similar to human behavior."37 Thus, I can licitly say that, for example, "my dog feels happy," because my dog dances about excitedly when I bring out her fetching ball, just as I might say that a human being is feeling happy when dancing about in an expression of glee. But what observable behavior does an atom or electron display which gives us an observational analogue for attributing feeling to it? 35 Robert J.

First of all, thinking and feeling are very different sorts of mental states, and thus the denial of atomic thinking states along with the acceptance of atomic feeling-tones is in so far intelligible. Again, notice that PPE is not the view that higher order conscious states are to be generalized to all genuine individuals. Indeed, there are numerous commonplace examples of the distinction, for example, plants (or at least plant cells) are living and sentient, but human beings (not apparently plants) think in the sense of deliberating by means of symbolic systems possessing semantic content. Feeling or sentient states are thus more elemental and generalizable than thinking states. Moreover, Hartshorne has responded to Keeling directly with an all-important clarification: Says Hartshorne, "the [behavioral] criteria are generalized, not just the concept [of feeling]."38 For Hartshorne, the behavioral criteria need not be "very similar to restrictively human behavior." (Ironically [in the context of Keeling's criticisms], the acceptance of such restrictive criteria would indeed represent a much too anthropomorphic procedure in metaphysical thinking.) The behavioral criteria to be generalized are such items as "self-initiated activity" and having "influences of the past and the environment," in effect, the most abstract features of human experience. Thus, observational analogues for attributing sentience or feeling-tones to, for example, electrons, are to be found in, say, their bonding behavior. Plato had the criteriological matter essentially right, then, when he said that animus or soul is to be attributed wherever we detect genuine self-motion. But suppose we grant Keeling's critique of PPE's specific use of the term "feeling." I still do not agree that such a critique would cut very deeply. If the use of such language as "feeling" in talk about elementary particles is to be deemed inappropriately anthropomorphic (or biomorphic)?or is otherwise a misuse of the term "feeling"? it can be replaced by more abstract philosophical language which expresses the position of PPE in a way that still suggests "psychological" predication in the description of all actual occasions. For example, to assert that an "electron has internal relations with its environment" is to assert a characterization of electrons in direct contradistinction to their reductionistic physicalist characterization. 38 Charles Hartshorne, "Why Psychicalism? A Response to Keeling's and Sheppard's Criticisms" Process Studies 6 (Spring): 67.</page><page sequence="21">Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2001 153 Inert, contextless, externally related electrons are fundamentally different entities from electrons with "windows," and this difference cannot be ignored no matter what the outcome of any debate on the appropriateness of such decriptors as "feeling." (5) Another objection from analytic quarters is based on the notion of supervenience as developed in the philosophy of Jaegwon Kim.39 Kim wants to preserve both physicalism and the common sense notion of mental causation. In order to achieve this he has proposed a "mereological supervenience" model of the mind-body relation in which mental causation is viewed as a kind of supervenient causation. In Kim's analysis, mental phenomena do not directly cause other mental phenomena to occur; rather, they do so only in the sense of being supervenient upon a physical state which in turn causes another physical state upon which is a supervenient mental state. Thus, the mind-body relation is roughly analyzed as follows: A: "when a mental event M causes a physical event P, this is so because M is supervenient upon a physical event, P*, and P* causes P" A1: "when a mental event M causes another mental event M*, this is so because M supervenes on a physical state P, and similarly M* on P*, and causes P*."40 The analyses A and A1 make it clear that the exercise of casual agency really takes place at the physical level (in A, P* causes P, and in A1, causes P*), while the mental events function as macrolevel descriptions of whole sets of microphysical events, sets labeled collectively as and P* (and this is just one way of defining "supervenience"). But, as Griffin41 argues and as Kim himself has more recently suggested, this whole approach seems to dissolve into epiphenomenalism. Kim has changed the vocabulary of the epiphenomenalist model (i.e., Kim speaks of a mental event as being supervenient upon the physical event rather than of a physical event causing a mental event), but the point 39 See Jaegwon Kim, Supervenience and Mind (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). 40 Ibid. 106. 41 Griffin, LWK, 219-227.</page><page sequence="22">154 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy remains that there is no direct casual r?le played by mental events. Thus, in Kim's own words, "any 'physicalistically correct' account of mental causation must . . . expos[e] itself to the charge of epiphenomenalism."42 This is a serious flaw as epiphenomenalism presents mental events as lacking causal efficacy and thus implies that our notion of intentional action is entirely illusory. Contrary to Kim's own desire to build our philosophical theories around the best of current scientific theory and practice, epiphenomenalism is an inherently anti evolutionary perspective as it suggests that animals and humans evolved with persistent natural selection of entirely superfluous mental entities. In the absence of successful objections against PPE, and logico philosophical considerations of parsimony as well as arguments from the current state of quantum theory in its favor, I am compelled to conclude that PPE is at the very least a serious candidate for a way forward in the mind-body debate which is "at the heart of the analytic agenda." Indeed, if quantum theory continues to develop in its current social-interactive and information-theoretic bent, my guess is that Hartshorne's greatest contribution to science and philosophy may well be viewed by future generations as his courageous and indeed tenacious advocacy of a social theory of reality, a theory at once physicalist and panexperientialist. 42 Kim, 360.</page></plain_text>
