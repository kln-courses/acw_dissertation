<plain_text><page sequence="1">4Io Reviews indistinguishable morphometrically and phenetically', but it is evident that she grouped together some other pairs with similar characteristics as well. In chapter five she discusses the implications of her identifications and the diffusion of races of maize between the two areas. Her study shows that the South American maize races of Confite Puntiagudo/Canguil, Oke, Karapampa and Puya were represented on Zapotec urns, and the Mesoamerican race of Chapalote on Peruvian jars. Observing that 'maize does not have a natural mechanism for seed dispersal and is therefore entirely dependent on humans for its survival' (pp. 99-200), she argues that people took these maizes from one area to the other before oo AD. Eubanks also uses stylistic evidence to support her case. She only found one example of a figure depicted with crossed-legs on a Moche vessel (fig. 40), but it is a common characteristic of Zapotec urn figures. Equally there is an example of a Zapotec pot with the vessel itself forming the body of the figure (fig. 107), a common feature of Moche pottery. Corn in Clay is a fascinating book for raising issues not only concerning the diffusion of maize, but also for highlighting implications for understanding stylistic variation in local traditions when cultural contact with anther area can be demonstrated to have occurred from independent strands of evidence. The book would have benefited from more careful editing. A comment on p. i i6 directs the reader to a pectoral glyph in fig. 88, but the item in the photo- graph is fragmentary and does not have a pectoral glyph. On p. 177 it is claimed that Oke is depicted on figs. 21 and 22, but it is not. The reference to 'Z-i6, fig. 94' on p. 178 should read 'fig. 95'. Figure 42 has an inaccurate caption. Another problem occurs on p. 177, where the Quebrada de Humahuaca in Argentina is erroneously mentioned as being at the 'southern boundary of the Inca Empire in pre-Columbian times'. Eubanks accepts rather uncritically the more recent name Ai-apaec for the anthropomorphic personage on the Moche vessels on the grounds that the identification is 'conventional' (p. 30). It is not clear to me whose convention this is. For the sake of consistency she decided to impose the term 'Classic', which is used in Mesoamerican archaeology, on the Andean material as well, going against current practice. Whereas the Zapotec ceramics have rather more provenance data associated with them, most of the Moche ceramics she discusses lack such information. With few exceptions, the publications she consulted on the Moche tend to be rather dated. Recent excavations of Moche sites are producing a wealth of data, including examples of pots with moulded maize from secure archaeological contexts (e.g. San Jose de Moro). This new material should provide Eubanks with further information to refine her intriguing research on the evolution of maize and the role of cultural contact between different regions of the Americas in the process. University of Wales, Lampeter PENNY DRANSART Ann Twinam, Public Lives, Private Secrets: Gender, Honor, Sexuality and Illegitimacy in Colonial Spanish America (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1999), pp. vii+447, $6o.oo. While the social and cultural history of the indigenous peoples of the New World (especially in Mexico) after the Spanish conquest has been revolutionised in recent decades, less attention has been paid to advancing our knowledge of the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 411 world created by Iberian immigrants and their creole descendants. The larger patterns of the story are already well known, including colonial politics, economy and religion, but as of yet we only have a vague understanding as to the values and mentalities that governed everyday creole life in the colonies. With Public Lives, Private Secrets, Ann Twinam breaks new ground by allowing the reader an intriguing glimpse into the world of colonial Latin American elites, their social behaviour, survival skills and anxious preoccupation with the concept of honour. With laborious archival research she has traced legitimation petitions from colonists to the King of Spain in the eighteenth century, as well as the fate of many of the petitioners as it is revealed in local archives. In her analysis, she successfully demonstrates the duality within elite circles between private and public persona, and the fascinating process by which an illegitimate might 'pass' as a person of honour among elite peers well aware of his or her private reality. Twinam constructs her book by looking at the problem from two perspectives. First, she extracts from the documents what they tell us about the life course of the petitioners, as well as the typical social responses that they were likely to encounter from their peers. Second, she studies the bureaucratic process itself, providing a novel view of the evolution of Bourbon social policies. In the first half, she separates the lifecourse of her subjects into the periods of birth, infancy, childhood and adulthood. Within this framework, she demonstrates the complexities surrounding an illegitimate birth, the situation of the parents and the diverging implications for men and women, the importance of the child's baptismal classification as well as private and public recognition by the newborn's family circle. She skilfully sketches the sort of situations that illegitimate children and young adults might typically encounter, and their driven quest for honour and property as adult petitioners to the King. From the point of view of royal bureaucrats she traces their evolution from complete inertia in the first half of the century to increased efficiency, and the eventual usage of legitimation cedulas as tools for social reform in its last two decades. Twinam handles her material with impeccable care and skill. She adorns her argumentative framework with fascinating anecdotal evidence, but reminds her readers that the nature of the sources does not allow for generalisation and overtheorising. At the same time, she uncovers tantalising trends and patterns in terms of gender, timing and geography. She demonstrates the complexities of the concept of honour among Latin American elites as it applied differently to men and women, and caused dilemmas for the descendants of illegitimates. While she successfully shows the restrictions that honour imposed within elite circles, she also accentuates its ambiguities as well as the creativity with which elites operated when it came to social 'passing'. Thus, Twinam argues that the loss of virginity before marriage or living in extended engagements or consensual unions by no means excluded elite women from acceptance within their social circle. While mothering illegitimate children could exclude then from future marriage, or damage the upward mobility of their children and relatives, their situation was considered a matter of conscience and not necessarily of honour. Combined with the knowledge that the rates of illegitimacy were generally higher in Latin America than in the North American colonies or in Europe, Twinam's findings thus portray a colonial world much more fluid, adaptable and accepting than one might have thought, and where the modern concepts of the marianismo and machismo of Latin American society simply do not apply. She also highlights the crisis this social system suffered in the late eighteenth century when colonial elites,</page><page sequence="3">412 Reviews faced with pressure from Bourbon reformers on the one hand, and the upward social mobility of the castes on the other, began to discriminate against illegitimates who traditionally would have passed successfully. Public Lives, Private Secrets provides an intriguing glimpse into the fundamental issues of sexuality, family and honour as they influenced the life histories of the Latin American legitimation petitioners and their families. Its broad scope extracts the common characteristics that shaped colonial life in Spanish America regardless of locality. With her sensitive analysis of this novel material Ann Twinam has produced a study that sets the standard for a dynamic future for the social and cultural history of Colonial Latin America. She deserves rounds of applause. University of Iceland ELLEN GUNNARSDOTTIR Kathryn Burns, Colonial Habits; Convents and the Spiritual Economy of Cuzco, Peru (Durham, NC, and London: Duke University Press, 999), pp. ix + 307, ?35.50, ?I2.95 pb, $49.95, $i7.95 pb. Following the groundbreaking efforts of Asunci6n Lavrin and Josefina Muriel, historians have begun, in the last two decades, to take an interest in conventual institutions for women in colonial Latin America. This interest has yielded the understanding that nunneries were not closed off depositories for elite women, untouched by the worldly milieu that surrounded them, but active and dynamic centres for the reproduction of the cultural world that had fostered them. The most sophisticated and thoughtful analysis to date of the process by which the fate of elite colonial society and its nunneries became intertwined is Kathryn Burn's work on convents in Colonial Cuzco. In her book Colonial Habits; Convents and the Spiritual Economy of CuZco, Peru, Burns traces the history of the city's nunneries from the Conquest to the National Period, from the point of view of their evolving relationship with the city's elite. In her analysis she coins what is bound to become a classic descriptive term for the process, that of the 'spiritual economy' signifying the 'inextricability' of the spiritual and economic exchanges between the convents and surrounding society. Burns begins by analysing the foundation of the Santa Clara convent in early sixteenth century Cuzco, in the midst of the turmoil of Conquest, from the perspective of the politics of mestigaje. Cuzco's Spanish Conquerors founded the convent in order to enter their mestizo daughters there, thus breaking the bond with their Indian mothers and acculturating them to Spanish life. In turn, their daughters would ensure Spanish hegemony in the region by reproducing Catholic culture, either as wives and mothers or by their example as nuns. She continues by tracing the evolution of the spiritual economy of Cuzco through the colonial era, underpinned by the constant exchange of elite daughters and dowries in return for conventual credit in the form of loans to the region's entrepreneurs, and prayers for its benefactors. Neither party perceived contradictory implications in their actions; in Burn's words, 'such things were simply common sense'. The nuns also took part in perpetuating the colonial order of which they were a part by reproducing Spanish family life within their cloisters which they filled with a large female population of lay women, servants and slaves. From the height of its baroque splendour, Burns then demonstrates the decline of the spiritual</page></plain_text>
