<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christian and Muslim Theology as Represented by Al-Shahrastani and St. Thomas Aquinas BY ALFRED GUILLAUME O much attention has been concentrated on the doctrines on which Christians and Muslims differ that often it is not realized how closely their philo- sophical presuppositions agree on many matters. In the following pages, which form a brief comparison of Ash'arite theology as represented by al-Shahrastani (d. 1153) in his Nihiyatu-l-Iqdam fT 'ilmi 'l-kalam 1 with Catholic theology as represented by St. Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) in his Summa contra Gentiles, an attempt is made to bring points of agreement into prominence. The Summa contra Gentiles possesses such enormous value in itself that the primary object of its composition has been lost sight of. Yet the connexion between it and Islam is indissoluble. It was written at the request of the Master-General of the Dominicans, Raymund of Pinnaforte, with the express purpose of convincing the Muslims of Spain of the rational basis of Christianity and the errors of their own religion.2 In the second chapter of the Summa (quae sit auctoris intentio) St. Thomas particularly singles out Muhammadans. Jews, he says, can be refuted from the Old Testament; heretics from the New Testament; but Machomestitae et Pagani can only be convinced by natural reason. And it is to natural reason that he proceeds to appeal. Though none was better equipped than St. Thomas to undertake an exposition of the Catholic Faith, it is, I think, clear that he felt himself at a disadvantage in writing against people whose books he could not read and of whom he knew only from the translations of others.3 He confesses that it is difficult to refute the errors of individuals whose arguments are unknown to him. He contrasts his own position with that of the early Fathers. They knew what they were talking about because they had been pagans themselves, or had lived among pagans and knew their beliefs. He obviously had no similar knowledge of Muhammadans. A work written under such conditions is likely to be gravely deficient. We should expect to find the writer sometimes pushing at an open door, and sometimes assuming common ground where none existed. We should also expect to find that some matters of great importance were overlooked and not even discussed. And all these things happened. Nevertheless we cannot but be glad that the Angelic Doctor's weakness became the source of his strength. Had he known that his adversaries agreed with him on so many points his exposition of the rational ground of the Christian faith would have lacked, by the omission of such points of agreement, that satisfying completeness which is the mark of his work. 1 The Summa Philosophiae of al-Shahrastani, Oxford, 1934. 2 See Miguel Asin, Homenaje a D. Francisco Codera, Zaragoza, 1904, p. 322. 3 He knew of some of the works of Algazel, Avicenna, Averroes, Alfarabius, and a few others. VOL. XIII. PART 3. 40</page><page sequence="2">ALFRED GUILLAUME- But still, if a work is to be counted a success or a failure in so far as it fulfils the purpose for which it was written, the Summa contra Gentiles was a failure. It did not attack many cardinal errors in the philosophy of Muslim doctors, nor did it explain Christianity in such a way as to meet Muhammadan objections. Its place was taken a few years later (1278) by Raymund Martin's Pugio fidei adversus Mauros et Judaeos, a work of amazing erudition. The author quotes freely from the sacred literature of Jews and Muslims, docu- menting his references with the care of a modern writer. Raymund's work, which was a triumph of piety and scholarship, is known only to a few Orientalists: it ceased to be of value when the Schools of Oriental Studies founded by the Dominicans came to an end. The work of Aquinas, which was never of value to those who would convert Muslims-or at any rate orthodox Muslims-has continued to be the textbook of the Roman Catholic priesthood, and a source of inspiration to all who share the Saint's ideal and purpose. References to Muhammad and Muhammadan Writers Before we pass to a consideration of the two Summas-the Latin and the Arabic-it seems fitting to look at one or two of St. Thomas's references to Muhammad and Muhammadan writers. The first is in I, vi. Here St. Thomas shows that he is acquainted with the Quran (ut patet eius legem inspicienti). Presumably his knowledge of it was gained from the version which was com- pleted in 1143. It was a translation in Latin made by " Robertus Retinensis, an Englishman, with the assistance of Hermannus Dalmata, at the request of Peter, abbot of Clugny ".1 St. Thomas makes two important points, one explicit, the other implicit. Muhammad, he says, produced no miracle in support of his claim to be the apostle of God (signa etiam non adhibuit supernaturaliter facta) and, to remove in advance Muhammad's claim (of which he seems to be aware) that the Quran itself is a miraculous proof of his divine mission, he prefaces this statement by the words Documenta etiam veritatis non attulit nisi quae de facili a quolibet mediocriter sapiente, naturali ingenio, cognosci possint. This criticism is amply justified; but it is difficult to believe that the Angelic Doctor would have been content to ignore the later Muhammadan doctrine of the miraculous powers of Muhammad (see Ch. xix of the Nihdya) had he known of it. Nor would he have chosen the terms he used in speaking of Muhammad's character had he known that the people whom he desired to convert to Christianity held that Muhammad was the perfect example of stainless manhood. (The subject of miracles as a proof of apostleship will be dealt with under their Christian and Islamic aspects in their proper place.) The second reference to Muhammadans is in Book III, lxix: Quidam etiam loquentes in lege Maurorum are mentioned. Loquentes is a literal translation of mutakallimun, theologians, a word which often occurs in the translation follow- ing. Elsewhere (Ch. xcvii) St. Thomas refers to these people with the note ut Rabbi Moyses dicit, thus showing that his knowledge of one school (or of a 1 Sale's Koran, p. xi. 552</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY section of one school) of thought in Islam-the Ash'arites to whom Shahrastani gave an elastic obedience-was drawn from Maimonides and not immediately from Arabic sources. Had he enjoyed access to the debates of Muslim scholastics as they are transcribed in such books as the Nihdya he would have found that the Ash'arite view of accidents against which he protests here was vigor- ously denied by other Muslim schools. A third may be found in II, xxxviii, diversos errores Gentilium philosophorum. These errors are the assertion that the world is eternal ; that the matter out of which it was formed is eternal; that it came by chance; through an intellect, or by attraction and repulsion. St. Thomas is right in attributing them to the philosophers, wrong by implication in attributing them to Muslims as such in a work designed to convert them. The Plan of Comparison On the whole the simplest plan would appear to be to follow the order of Shahrastani's work. His division of his subjects is not so logical as that of Aquinas, but his work is much smaller than the Summa, and in the form of a translation its text is not so easy to consult if it is not treated serially. CHAPTER I. THE PROBLEM OF CREATION. Cf. S.c.G. II, xiii ff. The Arabian philosophers for the most part asserted that the world had always existed. Their reasons were the following: (a) an efficient cause demands an effect; if there is no effect then the cause is imperfect because it lacks some- thing in order to produce its effect. God is the efficient cause of the world: God has existed from all eternity: therefore the world must have existed with its cause from all eternity. (b) God's action is eternal; if it were in time it must have advanced from potential to actual, and thus God must have suffered change, and change from potency to act implies the existence of another agent, which is impossible. Thus it follows that God's act and the world have always existed. (c) Movement demands change either in the mover or the moved. Therefore there is always a movement behind the last in an infinite regress. And if motion is eternal things moved must be eternal; and therefore the world has always existed. Let us see how the two Summas deal with these objections. (a) Shahrastani insists on the fundamental difference between causing (lit. necessitating) a thing and giving it being. By " giving being" is meant causing the issue from non-being to being. Thus the reciprocity latent in the efficient cause was deliberately excluded. As the Quran has said, " God was when nothing else existed ". The temporal notions of prior and post which belong essentially to causes have no bearing on the action of God who transcends time. (b) True, the world might have been other than it is, but the fact that it is in its essence contingent is due to the will and power of God. (c) The existence of the world is contingent, whether it be conceived as finite or infinite in any aspect. It can be proved that the spatial is finite, because you can always imagine a line 553</page><page sequence="4">ALFRED GUILLAUME- shorter than the infinite one. Thus infinity in an object or in space is absurd. And if an object is finite it could always be other than it is. Therefore its actual state is due to a determinant who exercises will and knowledge. The question was further complicated by the Emanation theory of the Arabian philosophers to which Avicenna lent his support. On the principle that " only one thing can issue from one thing ". they built up-or rather adopted-the theory of a hierarchy of Intelligences through which the acts of creation were mediated, delegated as it were, by God. Thus they endeavoured to explain the multiplicity of effects in the universe and yet to preserve a single and simple cause, namely God. Creation therefore to the philosophers was a necessary production. But as we see from Shahrastani's arguments we have no right whatever to suppose that these theories are Islamic, or Muhammadan as it used to be the fashion to say. They are as much Muhammadan as Jeans's theories of the universe are Christian-no more and no less. Orthodox Muhammadans maintained that the creation of the world was due to the predetermined will and knowledge of God. Though they were not concerned to deny absolutely the existence of Intelligences they refused to ascribe to them a share in creation in which God was alone. They rebutted the argument that that which is possible must always have existed with the necessary by the assertion that that implied a confusion between the temporal and the eternal; and furthermore possibility of existence is of the essence of non-existence apart from the author of existence. Its existence is therefore an accident. Again, the " necessity " which the philosophers endeavoured to interpose between God and the Universe by means of causation can be reduced to the category of the accidental. There is no mean between existence and non- existence, though there is an intermediate term between necessary and not necessary, namely potential. The only kind of necessity which attaches to the actuality of phenomena is that which is impressed by the compelling causation of divine knowledge and will. Another argument on which some of the Arabian philosophers relied in asserting that the world had always existed was that of the infinite number of human souls. The human soul is immortal, they said; all those that have existed in infinity still exist and therefore an infinite number must be in existence to-day. This argument the orthodox met by the assertion that the mere adding of souls to the infinite when children were born into the world proved that there was not an infinite number, for the infinite is not susceptible of plus and minus. But the problem of the relation of the world to God was not confined to the initial act of creation; it was carried on to embrace the connexion of the temporal with the eternal. The orthodox maintained against the specula- tive theologians that the divine attributes were capable of particular as well as universal action (but v. infra). Omniscience grasps all that is knowable. God's will is universal in that it embraces everything that can be the object 554</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY of it. There is thus no contradiction or inconsistency between universal and particular as applied to the divine attributes. The philosophers' doctrine of emanations falls under the objection they fain would raise against the particularity of divine action. They can only account for the multiplicity of forms by positing an antecedent preparedness in matter, while denying particularization in matter. But though they find seven heavens or four elements they cannot explain why there are those numbers.' Thomistic Parallels If we now turn to the Summa Philosophica the first thing that leaps to the eye is the extraordinary similarity between theme and treatment in the Christian and Muhammadan apologists. The problems are the same, the same solutions are reached, and the same opponents are in view, namely the Arabian philoso- phers. One considerable difference may be noted, though it will not be com- mented on: between Shahrastani and St. Thomas looms the influence of Averroes. When all Averroes' works have been published it will, I think, be manifest that Averroes was not an Averroist, and that bitterly as he attacked Avicenna there was not much to choose between them.2 In II, xv, St. Thomas makes much of the argument which constitutes the fundamental difference between Shahrastani and Avicenna, namely the differ- ence between essential causation and bringing into being. God is the sole possessor of being essentially in the sense that nothing is the cause of His being. Everything other than God owes its being to something external to itself-a cause. But God is the first cause. Everything that can or cannot be must have a determining cause, and since that cannot be traced to infinity it follows that one necessary being is the cause that determines the actuality of the contingent. Novelty in creation (novitas effectus = hudath) cannot indicate a change within the essence of the divine -agent because God's action is His essence. Nor, on the other hand, if God's action is eternal can it be argued that the effect is eternal because God acts voluntarily. Such a misunderstanding has arisen because human analogy suggests the intervention of the action of a motive force (actio virtutis motivae) between the act of the will and its effect. In God the act of understanding, willing, and creating are one (II, xxxv, cf. Shahrastani, p. 17). From our point of view St. Thomas's reasoning must appear closer and more cogent than Shahrastani's argument. The latter suffers from severe compression. As I have shown elsewhere, he fell into the habit of summarizing and epitomizing the writings and arguments of a vast number of authorities, and his discussions at times lack clarity and sequence : nevertheless it is clear that he understood the distinction between human volition and its consequence and the objects of divine causation. A similar explanation governs the actuality of particulars. A thing happens 1 See further, the translation of Ch. I of the Nihaya. 2 See my " Philosophy and Theology " in The Legacy of Islam (Oxford, 1932), and the literature cited there. 555</page><page sequence="6">ALFRED GUILLAUME- at a certain time, though it may have been willed from eternity, because if the will wills a certain definite thing it wills it at a definite time. The effect need not coincide in eternity with the will, but must happen when the will has appointed the effect to occur. It cannot be argued that the effect of the divine will is delayed, because its time was willed with its existence. Similarly we are not bound to admit the eternity of motion, for it has just been shown that God can originate novelties without a corresponding change in Himself. Again, Aquinas denies the propriety of temporal expressions in relation to non-existence. You cannot speak of before as being before time was. Nothing real corresponds to such a creation of the imagination. This is exactly Shahrastani's point. Nothing that St. Thomas has said is in any sense contra Mauros. Unwit- tingly he makes common cause with Shahrastani in his opposition to the philosophers. The only considerable difference that I can find is in II, xxxviii, where Aquinas rejects the arguments which Shahrastani accepts in favour of the world's not being eternal. For him it is a dogma of revelation rather than an intellectual truth, while Shahrastani believed that it was also logically true. CHAPTER II contains some of the worst as well as some of the best characteris- tics of Arabic kalam. It is concerned with the problem of why a multiplicity of things is brought into being by the Creator instead of one. Avicenna tried to explain the problem by the introduction of the Intelligences which have been mentioned already in Ch. I. The first cause, which was God, in that He knew himself, produced a single effect, namely the first Intelligence. Assum- ing this, then this first intelligence, not being its own being and possessing being only from another, is only potentially existent, and potency attached to its action. By its knowledge of the First being other than itself an intelligence inferior to itself flowed from it. Carrying on the descent we reach the sub- lunar world in the way described in the text. Thus it is obvious that Avicenna and his followers attributed creation to creatures and destroyed the immediate relation between God and the Universe. The Universe was not the immediate result of the will of the First Cause, but the result of a combination of causes. Thus chance entered into the scheme of things. Shahrastani refutes this doctrine by appealing to the principle he has already laid down that the existence of everything depends on God giving it existence, and the contingent and potential are no exception to this absolute law. Further he shows that if we shift the plurality from the Cause to the Caused the difference still remains, because plurality of the correlative cannot have originated from the simplicity of the cause. (The real point of the argument is sometimes all but lost in the battle of words.) The fact that the Universe is as it is, is due to the creative will and purpose of God. 556</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY Bound up with the problem of multiplicity is the problem of evil. Shahrastani refutes the Magian doctrines of dualism-the opposition between the cosmic forces of light and darkness. Here he abandons the discussion of evil, and returns to it towards the end of his book. He has now to consider the place that is to be assigned in a created universe to the power of man. It would seem from what has gone before that inter- mediaries have been ruled out, and only God is left as the agent in creation with a power that is continuous and all-embracing. If this doctrine be pushed too far it is obvious that man has no power over his acts at all. In effect, says Shahrastani, we are committed to a theory of knowledge and will. We cannot consider an act apart from the interaction of knowledge and will. Man's know- ledge at the best is imperfect. How then can it grasp being and universal truth ? Yet the intellect, by presenting to the will the object of its activity, incites it to motion. On the other hand the will moves the intellect. Shahrastani here departs from the line which was afterwards taken by Aquinas, by adopting the theory peculiar to the Ash'arite theologians. This is the most subtle and perhaps least profitable theory of the Muslim community, but it had the merit of finding a place for man's free will within the frame of divine predestination. In brief the theory was that man " acquired " power over a particular act. He did not " create " his acts, for that would be to infringe upon the prerogative of the creator. The discussion which follows may be disregarded here, though there would seem to be some connection between the Islam doctrine of kasb " acquisition " and electio. Thomistic Parallels This question for St. Thomas is bound up with the doctrine of the divine attributes to which Shahrastani returns again and again. God's will is distinct from his essence, but it is His essence. God's act of intelligence is His being, because as God's being is in itself perfect no additional perfection is possible. Further, if will were something additional to the divine essence it would be almost accidental. Now the principal object of God's will is His essence. Aquinas's proof that God wills particulars is that God Himself is the tnd of all things, and in willing Himself He wills other things that tend to Him. Further, will follows intellect; and inasmuch as God understands Himself He under- stands other things in Himself. Thus a multitude of things willed is not incon- sistent with the divine simplicity: for all things are in one relation to God's will in that they are within His goodness. The multitude of things understood does not involve multiplicity in the Divine essence, nor that God's intellect should be composite. Similarly with the will and things willed. In II, xx f., St. Thomas denies that a body can create and explains the difference between creation and production by means of an instrument. Per hoc autem destruitur quorumdam philosophorum error qui dixerunt Deum creasse primam substantiam separatam, et ab ea fuisse creatam secundam et sic quodam ordine usque ad ultimam. 557</page><page sequence="8">ALFRED GUILLAUME- Like Shahrastanl he is denying the validity of Avicenna's hypotheses. The two writers cannot be compared as though they were equals. But it will be noted that their general conclusion is the same. The Christian writer is able to take a much more detached and judicial position than the Muslim can occupy. The latter is beset by opponents who choose the ground on which he has to fight. The one writes as it were in his study in academic calm: the other is palpably hot and dusty from disputes in the Schools. His opponents are men-and quarrelsome men too-as well as ideas, while St. Thomas always appears to be dealing with books and theories. CHAPTER III Here Shahrastani polemizes against what passed for the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, throwing as it were a dart or two at the Dualists. The existence of two Gods is impossible. If their wills were at variance either a deadlock would result or one god would prove to be stronger than the other, and thus the only god. On the other hand if they agreed to act together in the act of production this would be impossible, and is not to be admitted, because pro- duction is a category in which only one agent can participate. And if one acted and the other remained quiescent only one would be god. Again, to be able to assert plurality within the godhead it must be possible to assert that two or more gods possess specific differences. Such differences, says Shahrastani, are only realized in temporal, local, and subjective categories all of which are impossible so far as the deity is concerned. An unnamed opponent points out that the hypothetical argument from opposed wills within the godhead is unsound, because will depends upon knowledge, and it would be absurd to suppose that anyone would argue that two divine persons 1 were not equally omniscient. If they both possessed all knowledge it is inconceivable that they should will opposites. All the Muham- madan schoolmen could say in reply to this was that the supposition of an impossibility was possible, and as it was impossible to prove anything of God demonstratively the supposition was good enough for them! Shahrastani saw that this was hardly an adequate reply to the objection and he adds a reply of his own which is a slight improvement but really is no answer. He attempts to show that there would be a duality within the knowledge of the two divine beings. But this is of course absurd if both were omniscient. He is on stronger ground when he asserts that there can be no distinction between two divine beings, unless there is some special field peculiar to one or the other. Even if it is admitted that the existence of more than one god is a logical 1 The word person is of course not used. It is more than strange that Shahrastani, who knew a good deal about the Christian doctrine of three persons and one God (see his Milal), should be so perverse as to confine this discussion to the refutation of a theory which verges on polytheism. Possibly the explanation is that intellectual Muslims have always been uneasy when hypostases are mentioned, owing to the orthodox doctrine of the divine attributes; v. infra. 558</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY possibility there is no proof thereof, and one cannot be expected to worship a god who is no more than a logical possibility. St. Thomas In the first place it should be noted that St. Thomas frankly admits that the doctrine of the Trinity cannot be discovered by man's reasoning. It has been revealed to us in Holy Scripture and is of such a nature that we cannot presume to understand it perfectly. Nevertheless it can be shown that such a belief is not contrary to natural reason. It is a little strange that in a book intended for non-Christian readers the author should have traversed the ancient heresies. Some of them could be made to apply helpfully to contemporary unbelievers, but not many. However, the note on Arianism and its similarity with the teaching of Avicenna is illuminating. Of Arius and his followers he says: Quia iste Filius a deo Patre est alius, aestimaverunt eum non esse eiusdem naturae cum Deo Patre: non enim intellegere poterant, nec credere volebant quod aliqui duo, secundum personam distincti, habeant unam essentiam et naturam (IV, vi). These words exactly describe the attitude of the Muslim disputants. They could not understand, and were unwilling to believe. It is most unfortunate that the idea, much less the word, persona, which mediates between the warring conceptions of unity and plurality, has no place in ShahrastanI's thought. He saw that the essence (dhdt) of God must be One, and he thought that distinc- tion could only be located in finite categories. Muslims oppose the idea of hypostasis and persona, but it is doubtful if more than a few (of whom, unhappy to relate, Shahrastani was not one) understood what is meant by it. Arabic has no word for personality. Shakhs is a person in one sense, but the word cannot be applied to Allah, whose unique characteristic it is to be unlike everything else. Allah is an individual-not a person, though inasmuch as Muslim theology endows him with attributes which we are wont to consider personal it must not be assumed that the personality of God is to be denied. Here St. Thomas confutes orthodox Muhammadan teaching implicitly and in general and the quasi-heretical teaching of Avicenna explicitly and in particular. The place and function of the First Intelligence according to Avicenna was similar to that assigned to the Son of God by Arius. St. Thomas replies to the assertion that there cannot be two agents in the act of production by saying that the Father and the Son do the same things in the same way: they have the same virtus et potestas. They are not two Gods because they do not share the divine essence between them as two men share human nature-the divine nature and God are not distinct. This is precisely the point that Shahrastani is unable to grasp. He quotes (apparently with approval) the philosophers who say that because two Gods would each share in being necessarily existent, necessary existence must be a genus and essential to them, their distinction being a species so that their essence must be composite. 559</page><page sequence="10">ALFRED GUILLAUME- These and other arguments against the Trinity will be found in c. Gent. IV, x and xi. The answers reveal the subtle and penetrating reasoning of their author at his best, and form the background of much that has been written since his day. The words remanet sola distinctio relationis deserve to be borne in mind as they occur often in connection with the Muhammadan doctrine of the distinct character of the attributes of God. CHAPTER IV The Refutation of Anthropomorphism is closely connected with the preceding chapter, though for orthodox Muslims it was a far more serious question, because it was a doctrine which was held in one form or another by heretics and schismatics within the Muhammadan community. Therefore we should expect that the reaction against any form of anthropomorphism would run to extremes. In the Quran it is written that nothing resembles God and God does not resemble anything, a statement which would exclude all attempts to form a concept of the eternal if it were allowed to stand alone. In practice, as Shahrastani's book shows, these words were not allowed to stand without qualification. Muhammadans, like Christians, felt themselves able to predicate attributes of God. They carefully guarded the descriptions so that it should be understood that what was predicated of God was predicated univocally. But in this chapter, which is aimed principally at the Shi'as, who, like Christians, believed that the deity was revealed in the flesh,' excessive emphasis is placed upon the transcendence of God. Shahrastani denies that God is a body or has any of the properties of body. He cites the anthropomorphists' proof text (based on Genesis i, 26), " God created Adam according to the form of the Compassionate," but he does not explain it. Those who held that God had a body based their belief on the statement that God spoke in the Fiat of Creation, and speaking implies hearing. When he spoke novelty was originated in His essence. Shahrastani refutes all such claims by the argument that nothing that circumscribes the infinite nature of God is permissible in our thought of the deity. There can be no potentiality or contingency in God. Some Muslims in their reaction against anthropo- morphism went so far as to deny all attributes in God except the attribute of divinity which is incomprehensible, to which others replied that the divinity of God could be known through visions. The Quran, like the Bible, speaks of God as being " on high" and super- ficially it would seem that Muhammadanism and Christianity are committed to the view that God is in a place. Shahrastani shows that this and other similar expressions are to be interpreted metaphorically. The mistake has arisen through the application of human analogies and limitations to the divine 1 Many thousands in India believe that the Aga Khan, who claims to be a Muslim, is the incarnation of God. " Missionaries in your Highness's pay and acting under your instructions preach in every prayer-house that your Highness is the Almighty God, and that Divine worship is to be paid to you and to no one else." (An Open Letter published by the Secretary of the Khoja Reformers' Society, Karachi, 1927, quoted in The Moslem World, April, 1934.) 560</page><page sequence="11">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY essence. But even so it may be asserted that God is in a place. He is in the world because His knowledge and will operate there, while His holiness and transcendence demand that we should understand that He is external to the world. Terms that indicate direction and dimension are meaningless when applied to the infinite. As applied to the deity they are concessions to man's limitation, not boundaries to God's sphere of activity. As to the assertion that God became a speaker after an eternal silence Shahrastani replies that God heard and spoke from all eternity. The novelty is in the object of God's activity, not in the activity itself. Thomistic Parallels In I, xx, quod Deus non est corpus, Aquinas agrees fully with Shahrastani that no quantitative body, no potential or contingent trait can be predicated of God. The imagination, which is the source of all attempts to ascribe to God corporeal substance or human form, ought to be put aside when we meditate on things incorporeal. Yet in one important respect St. Thomas joins issue with the Muslims, namely in their assertion that nothing resembles God. There is a sense in which man is like God. Effects fall short of their causes it is true, but there must be some likeness between them, and the perfection which God bestows on things reflects in some way His own inimitable perfection. Holy Scripture reminds us that man was made in the image of God, and also (Isaiah xl, 18) that nothing is like God. Therefore it is better to say that the creature is like God than to say that God is like the creature. We can say that a portrait is like a man: we do not say that a man is like a portrait. CHAPTER V is short and of minor importance. It deals with the propriety of using epithets of God. Islam and Christianity are agreed that the terms by which we denote God's perfection must be diverse, and that they have the authority of revelation and man's intuitive need of them. CHAPTER VI, which deals with universals and particulars from a purely philosophical aspect, has no counterpart in the Summa c. Gent., though it is useful for reference as it has an important bearing on the question as to whether God's knowledge is confined to universals and whether a knowledge of particulars can be asserted of God without compromising the simplicity of the divine nature. CHAPTER VII is also too philosophical to call for much attention in the Summa c. Gent. so far as the discussion as to whether the non-existent is a thing is concerned. The belief that the world came into being out of pre-existent matter was one which struck at the root of the theistic view of the universe, and as such is strongly resisted by Shahrastani and St. Thomas. (There is, of course, a close connection between this theory and Ch. I, which deals with the 561</page><page sequence="12">ALFRED GUILLAUME- creatio ex nihilo.) Avicenna was responsible for the prevalence of the belief among Muslim philosophers, though it had been heard of before his time. The theory that the Creator himself was merely one of the first principles is not, of course, due to Avicenna. The Arabic word bdri' rendered "creator " is the same as that of Genesis i, 1, in Hebrew; and it is doubtful whether in itself it contains the idea of creating out of nothing. (The same may be said of the Arabic synonym khalaqa. Both verbs can be followed by the material from which the object is " created ".) The other form in which the theory of pre-existent matter was held is interesting, though not important, for our purpose, namely that the world came into existence from atoms which were in themselves indivisible but capable of forming, in conjunction with other atoms, all the diverse forms of the universe with which we are familiar. The discussion which follows has a very real importance in that it shows how the theory of substance and accident must break down in the last resort. The irreducible atom can be said to be free of accident because it. cannot be other than it is. On the other hand, in as much as it occupies "place " it is an accident, or rather susceptible of accident. A deadlock was reached and no further progress could be looked for in this direction. Shahrastani sums up by saying that matter is never free from form in which it must subsist. Form subsists not in matter but in the datorformarum. Matter by receiving form preserves it, and form only comes into being in matter. In actual existence they cannot be distinct. ?There can be no matter without form and no form without matter, though in the mind they are distinct. Thomistic Parallels In II, xl, St. Thomas addresses himself to the problem quod materia non est prima causa distinctionis rerum. Matter cannot be a cause of anything because it is potential. Matter only becomes a cause when it is moved by an agent. Therefore when an effect results from the disposition of matter we must look beyond the matter to the intention of the agent for the cause. (However he does allow a certain causality to matter when the intention of the agent fails, as in the production of monstra et alia peccata naturae. Such things result a casu propter materiam.) He argues that forms do not result from the disposi- tion of matter, as Avicenna maintained, as their first cause, but on the contrary matter is disposed to become form, that is to say that the idea behind the form determines the form and the disposition of matter, not the disposition of matter the form. The celestial bodies are an indication that pre-existent matter was not the cause of the distinction of things, because though they differ from one another they have no contrary. And then, to push the argument further back, if matter were the cause of distinction it would have to be distinct in itself. But it is not. Every matter comes into being from something else and as we have seen the ultimate owes its existence to God. Form is superior to matter because it is its perfection. Forms are not produced for the sake of matter but 562</page><page sequence="13">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY matter for the sake of form. Therefore the distinction in things in their several forms is not for the sake of matter. In the final paragraph to this chapter he indicates the ultimate source of these theories and refutes the upholders of them in their more modern guise : per hoc autem excluditur opinio Anaxagorae ponentis infinita principia materialia a principio quidem commixta in uno confuso, quae postmodum intellectus separando rerum distinctionem constituit ; et quorumcumque aliorum ponentium diversa principia materialia ad distinctionem rerum causandam. Once more agreement between Christian and Muslim is attained. Both hold that matter is inferior to form; that it exists for the sake of form, and that it owes its existence to the Giver of Forms. CHAPTER VIII marks a definite cleavage between Shahrastani and St. Thomas, but it will be seen from the former's words that there was a con- siderable body of opinion among Muslims, especially the philosophers, which by its insistence upon distinctions within the simplicity of God's nature held much that was favourable to a Christian interpretation of God's nature. One section argued that the world's need of something to determine what should and what should not be, demanded that the world should have a Maker. A Maker must have power. The perfection of His work points to His knowing, and the principle of diversity in individuals points to His willing. All these attributes point to their possessor being alive. Unless we used adjectives which expressed these qualities we should have to employ their opposites and say that God was impotent, ignorant, and dead, which God forbid! It was argued against the orthodox school that they had no right to infer the divine attributes by means of analogies drawn from man's experience because they held that things differed by their essences and existence (i.e. that they were so because God had made them so and not for any other intelli- gible reason). Moreover they held that man's free will and power was only " acquired ". He could not "produce " anything. So that they had no right to draw a parallel between divine and human acts and from that deduce divine attributes. The orthodox replied that they did recognize the validity of intellec- tual modes and aspects and the influence of intention on act. Again it was argued against them that they had no right to use human analogies and say a building requires a builder and a builder must have power, etc., because a human builder required material, and they did not admit that God created the world out of pre-existent matter. Thus they had no right to employ induction in seeking for the divine attributes. The Imam al-Haramain denied this, and asserted that the existence of the contingent demanded that God should have acted by way of an attribute because that which causes through its essence does not specify (i.e. that the same cause always has the same effect) : therefore, as God has specified things, he must have done so through an attribute which was additional to His essence and the Quran calls this attribute volition. (The debate then repeats some of the 563</page><page sequence="14">ALFRED GUILLAUME- arguments as to essential causation and divine production mentioned in Oh. I.) The opponents maintained that all the attributes were contained in the assertion that God is necessarily existent essence in majesty and perfection. We can name him by analogy from indications of His essential activity or from His transcendence above human names. The first class is relative like Cause, Principle, Maker; the second negative like One, Intelligence, Intelligent, Necessary. The orthodox maintained that this view of God is inadequate. Relative terms must be excluded in all references to God. All such expressions, by implying a relation closer than and other than that of servile dependence upon God, are invasions of the divine prerogative. In fact the philosophers' hypotheses of necessitator and necessitated, First Cause and first effect, are practically the same as the Christian doctrine of the relation of Father and Son-an impious blasphemy against which the Quran warns us. Thomistic Parallels If this chapter stood alone it would be difficult to discover what Shahrastani really thought about the divine attributes. He is concerned to uphold them, but they must be asserted in terms which do not compromise the simplicity of God. The fundamental difference between Christianity and Islam in its doctrine of God lies in the conception of man's relation to God. The only relation which orthodoxy permits is that of created to creator, of slave to lord. The Christian conception of man as in some sense a dim reflexion of the divine glory, a partaker in the divine nature, a child of God, has been lost. The centuries since Muhammad had been occupied in controversy with Chris- tians, and the reaction against the Christian doctrine of the incarnation had made Islamic orthodoxy harder and less receptive than at first. With the rebellion of the mystics and heretics against this view of man's spiritual life and the loss of vitality when the intimacy of the Quranic religion was submerged in the Muhammadan code we are not concerned here. No such balance is to be found in any Muhammadan theologian (save perhaps Algazel) as St. Thomas gives us in his weighing of the claims of God and man in S.c.G. I, xxix f. He carefully distinguishes what can be said of God alone and what can be said of God and His creatures; and he finds a connecting link in the divine perfection, a portion of which in varying degrees is given to every object of the divine creation. He agrees with Shahrastani in holding that what can be said of God and man is only by similitude and metaphor, and he avers that a plurality of names is not inconsistent with the divine simplicity. So far as the mind is concerned we can only know God from His effects. Here again he is in agreement with the Muslims. And since the effects are various the terms by which we denote God must also be many according to the perfections that are revealed in the world of phenomena. If we could understand God's essence we should use only one name of Him. 564</page><page sequence="15">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY As the space allotted by Shahrastani to the divine attributes is very large and under several heads it is advisable to curtail the discussion here in order to bring the two works into closer relation one with another. CHAPTER IX. THAT THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES CAN BE KNOWN This chapter witnesses to the remarkable diversity of views about the divine nature which were held by Muslims in the centuries before the school of al-Ash'ari became dominant in the Muslim world. In the first place the Mu'tazila held that God was Living, Knowing, Deter- mining, in His essence, not by qualities subsisting therein. Some of them held that God knows himself, but that His self is not to be called Knowledge. When the Mu'tazila came to define what was meant by divine attributes most of them said that they were names and predications of the divine essence. They were not states and qualities such as attach to mundane things. The Ash'arites, who became the orthodox party, claimed that God knew by knowledge, willed by a will, heard with hearing, etc., and that these qualities were additional to His essence, eternally existent as ideal realities subsisting within His essence. The philosophers denied the propriety of using such terms. The necessarily- existent was a simplicity, and no qualification or species could be joined to Him. No distinction of any kind whatever is to be asserted of His essence. Negative terms may be used which imply His difference from everything else, e.g. One or Intelligence which imply his immateriality; or relative terms like Maker, Wise; or terms both negative and relative like Willer. But relative terms must not be understood to necessitate plurality in His essence. Those who upheld the doctrine of separate attributes (Sifatiyya) within the deity asserted that there were four valid analogies which could be drawn from human experience and reason and applied to prove the existence of dis- tinctions within the Godhead: (1) The first was cause. In this world a man knows because he possesses knowledge. Cause and effect are inseparable and unthinkable apart from each other. If it were possible to think of a Knower without knowledge it would be equally possible to think of knowledge without a knower. He who has qualities must be described by them, and if he is described them by he must needs have the qualities. This argument covered the divine will and speech. The Mu'tazila objected that such an explanation of the principle of causation made God the object of cause. God knows necessarily from His essence. More- over even so far as this world is concerned the analogy breaks down, for necessary propositions have no cause. What cause can be assigned to the sub- stance being receptive of accident ? The necessary distinction between the eternal who is not cause and the temporal which is caused has been lost. To this the Sifatiyya replied that by causation they meant logical necessity and a reciprocal logical connection. They did not mean the causation of an 565</page><page sequence="16">ALFRED GUILLAUME- agent in production. Their opponents answered that there was no resemblance between the knowingness of God and the creature save in name. (2) The second argument on which the Sifatiyya relied was " condition ", i.e. a thing or circumstance without which something cannot occur but which does not by itself necessitate the existence or occurrence of that thing. Thus they argued that life was a condition of knowledge in this world and the next. But the objection to this is that life itself is insufficient without a sound body in this world, and therefore no analogy can be drawn from mere life and applied to the being of God. (3) The third argument on which they relied was the validity of definition. The Sifatiyya, as Shahrastani points out, failed to perceive the difference between God's knowledge and men's knowledge. A knower is one who possesses knowledge, but can this be said of God ? It is true that in the Quran God is said to possess certain things, but such things are patently not attributes. The Sifatiyya held that it was impossible that divine essence should comprehend or be connected with an objective relation, and therefore it must have a comprehending quality which could come into relation with knowables. The Mu'tazila objected that God knows things because He is a knower, not by knowledge, and not by essence. No definition covers this. The Sifatiyya replied that the essence itself could not contain the distinction between what is known and what is decreed, because the first is a much wider category than the second; and if they were not distinct everything that God knew would be decreed by Him. Therefore there must be separate qualities beyond the divine essence. The Mu'tazila answered that these were merely intellectual relationships. A substance was not a plurality because we could conceive different things about it. To this the Sifatiyya agreed but added that the different relations of substance and accident were not the same as the different specific realities of the divine attributes. We can know that God is self-subsistent, but that does not tell us that He knows. The Mu'tazila denied the validity of the analogy between human and divine characteristics. One tried to find a means of reconciling the two differing parties by saying that there was no real difference between those who hold that knowingness was a state which could not be said to exist or not to exist, and the Sifatiyya who held that it existed in the divine essence. Here apparently it is Shahrastani himself who interposes the objection that those who hold that states or modes could be predicated of the divine essence went dangerously near the Christian doctrine of a trinity of persons and a unity of substance. After a long-drawn-out discussion with many repetitions the Mu'tazila ask their opponents to define the attributes to which they assign a positive existence eternally with God. If they are not His essence what are they ? They must either be temporal or eternal, and as they cannot be temporary they must by being eternal be other gods. The Sifatiyya replied that this was no true dilemma. The attributes are not the essence nor other than the essence. In saying this they were claiming 566</page><page sequence="17">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY the same freedom as the authors of the theory of states or modes, who said that they neither existed nor did not exist. Divinity is perfection. You cannot say that eternity is the specific attribute of God, for that would make him a genus. God does not " need" His attributes as if they were instruments. What the philosophers call relationships and aspects they called attributes. Shahrastani brings the debate to a close by asserting that there is a real difference between these characteristics, though he does not say how they are to be indicated. His contribution is the assertion that the misunderstanding has come about through applying existence and all its implications to God and man univocally. Thomistic Parallels It will be obvious that the views of the Mu'tazila, who were regarded much as we regard Arians, are sometimes nearer to the Christian interpretation of the nature of God, while at other times the more orthodox Muslim inter- pretation seems to be more in accord with our view. It will have been seen that there is no sure foundation for very definite statements of what was believed in the twelfth century among Muslims. We have no clear statement as to whether the attributes were in God's essence or additional to it. The Mu'tazila in their debate with the Sifatiyya tried to get a definite answer from their opponents and were not successful. Their theologians were bound to uphold the doctrine of the divine attributes as it is based on the Quran; but as they said, it could be understood to indicate distinctions within the godhead and thus imperil the central doctrine of Islam, the oneness of God. On this subject St. Thomas has perhaps more to offer Muslims than any- where else so far as philosophy is concerned. He begins by asserting that the divine essence is such that no human mind can grasp it. We must begin by endeavouring to ascertain what it is not rather than what it is. Thus by dis- tinguishing God from everything else we shall reach a knowledge of God by negation which will at any rate assure us that God is different from all else, c.G. I, xiv. This via remotionis has already been met with in Shahrastani. With consummate skill St. Thomas develops this argument to show that God is eternally necessarily existent without potentiality, matter, or composition, not a body, and so on. God is therefore His own essence. He is also His own being, because if He were not His own being He would possess it only by participation, not by essence, and could not, therefore, be the first being-which is absurd. Therefore God is His own essence and His own being. From this it follows that nothing can be added to God's essence by way of accident. In I, xxiv, Quod esse divinum non potest designari per additionem differentiae substantialis, he raises the same question as the Mu'tazila. That which makes a thing to be in act and is intrinsic to that thing is either the whole or part of its essence. That which designates anything by an essential designa- tion makes it to be in act and is intrinsic to the thing designated, otherwise it would not be essentially designated by it. Ergo oportet quod sit vel ipsa VOL. XIII. PART 3. 41 567</page><page sequence="18">ALFRED GUILLAUME- essentia rei vel pars essentiae. Such a theory, which would seem to be the logical conclusion from the position taken up by the Sifatiyya, would there- fore result in our being compelled to believe that God's essence is composed of parts, which is demonstrably false, see xviii. What the Ash'arites called sifdt dhdtiyya, essential attributes, are expressly denied by St. Thomas (I, xxiv, ad fin.) when he says that if anything were added to God to designate Him with an essential designation it would give to that to which it was added the notion of its proper quiddity or nature, because what is added in this way gives the thing actual being. But actual being is the divine essence (see xxii). Relinquitur ergo quod supra divinum esse nihil possit addi quo designet ipsum designatione essentiali, sicut differentia designat genus. Nevertheless the Ash'arites tried to guard themselves against the doctrine of specific differences within the godhead. It was this subject as much as any which caused Muslim theologians to discourage the study of philosophy. It was a subject which was only safe in the hands of skilled dialecticians. Aquinas so far would appear to have been what the Muhammadans call a Mu'attil, one who stripped the divine being of attributes. But the key to the understanding of his theology is the conception of being. To him the being of God was not an abstraction from which all content had been removed by means of negations, but it was universal perfection (I, xxviii). A thing which is its own being is perfection: a thing which is only white (e.g. possesses some whiteness) cannot be perfectly white because the whole possibility of whiteness does not belong to it. The notion that by denying states of being to God we diminish his perfection is due to equivocation. It would be true of us, but it is not true of God, who is His own being. No statement that we make of God can be univocal, though it can be intelligible. As we cannot grasp the oneness and simplicity of God we should endeavour to find the image of His perfection in multiplicity. And by multiple conceptions. Our assertions about God are not therefore purely synonymous, and yet they do not imply diversity in God, because we are trying by these various attributes to designate a reality which is One. The complexity resides in the intellect, not in the object of its contemplation. CHAPTER X. THE DIVINE KNOWLEDGE AND ITS RELATION TO PARTICULARS The problems raised in this chapter are the relation of God's knowledge to future contingents and the relation of God's knowledge to particulars. With regard to the first, certain heretics held that God's knowledge was constantly receiving additions from new happenings because knowledge that a thing would happen was different from knowledge that a thing had happened. This the orthodox sternly denied. God's knowledge is in a timeless relation to phenomena, and His essence is not affected by the advent of the knowable. To perfect knowledge there is no difference between knowledge that a thing will happen and knowledge that it has happened. Human analogies have led men astray here. 568</page><page sequence="19">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY Avicenna argued that the necessarily existent one could not know things external to Himself, so that His knowledge was constantly undergoing change. His intelligence only embraced universals actively and not passively. The orthodox refused to use the word intelligence of God and confined themselves to "knowledge " which has the sanction of the Quran. It was maintained that God's knowledge of singulars could be inferred from the order of the universe, but that this method was not open to those who denied God's knowledge of singulars. Avicenna held that intelligence was greater where matter was less, and that God who has no matter is the supreme Intelligence. The orthodox denied that God only knew His essence. And if His intelligence was active and not passive it would follow that every object of His cognition would be passive to Him, and He would therefore be the object of cognition to His own intelligence. If God's knowledge of Himself is essential and His knowledge about things necessary what is their connexion one with another ? To distinguish between them is to postulate plurality in God. With regard to the assertion that God only knows universals the orthodox replied that unless we fall back upon one universal God's knowledge would still be plural and to avoid that we should have to say with some that God only knows his essence. A new word is introduced into the discussion at the end of the chapter, namely " capacity " or " fitness ". It can only be applied to God metaphorically. It is used to cover the divine will, knowledge, etc. It is not to be confused with dispositio, but is rather a term for the perfection which is in all the divine attributes. The question whether perfection alone ought to be regarded as the only attribute was so perplexing that one philosopher took refuge from the difficulty in a blind adherence to the words of the Quran. Thomistic Parallels St. Thomas begins by arguing that God's intelligence may be inferred from His perfection. The highest perfection to which mortals can attain must in some sense be a mark of the divine perfection. He agrees with Avicenna that every being is intelligent in proportion to its immateriality.1 Aliqua res est intelligens quod est sine materia, cuius signum est quod formae fiunt intellectae in actu per abstractionem a materia. Understanding is of universals, not of particulars, because matter is the principle of individuation. Now as God is His own being it is obvious that God's intelligence is identical with His essence. By its exercise the human intellect achieves act and some sort of perfection; but the divine intelligence remains in itself. God understands Himself perfectly and His intelligence is one in act with the intelligible. The only object which God knows of itself and directly is Himself, for He would 1 No attempt is made here or elsewhere to discuss the ultimate origin of Avicenna's theories. He confesses his great debt to Alfarabius, who depended on translations from Greek via Syriac. See further The Legacy of Islam, under " Philosophy and Theology ". 569</page><page sequence="20">ALFRED GUILLAUME- have to turn away from Himself as it were to regard some other object. But any other object would be inferior to Himself, and thus the divine knowledge would be impaired-an impossibility. But we must not suppose that because God only knows Himself directly He knows nothing but 'Himself. Knowing a thing means knowing its capabilities. Inasmuch as God is the efficient cause of all things He must know all that they are capable of. Therefore all effects which pre-exist in God must be within His intelligence, and everything must exist in Him in its intelligible form. Against the Arabian philosophers St. Thomas argued that the theory that God does not know particulars is inconsistent with His perfection. The nature of everything is to participate in some measure in the divine perfection. By knowing Himself God knows the modes in which His perfection is imitable, I, 1. Every particular is made up of determinate matter and of a form indi- vidualized in matter. In man matter and particulars are understood by imagina- tion and sense and the proper object of the human intellect is universal. How then can the divine intellect, which is supremely immaterial, take count of matter and particulars ? The answer goes back to the primary principle of St. Thomas that God knows His own being, and that everything that is partakes of being and is in the divine essence so far as its source is concerned. Matter and accidents are modes of being and are therefore within God's know- ledge, so that knowledge of particulars must be asserted of God. To deny to God knowledge of particulars is really to deny divine causality. Now if God knows all that exists He knows all that can or might exist. God is apart altogether from time, and therefore strictly there is no such thing as a future contingent to Him. Here again the reasoning of the Christian scholar would seem to reconcile the dispute among the Muslim doctors. The teaching of Avicenna that God knew only His essence was a difficulty for them because the essence of God was regarded as beyond analogy. There was no scope for an imitatio dei in perfec- tion either of intellect, morality, or ethic. Therefore if they admitted that God knew only Himself it followed that He could not know what went on in this world, and consequently the doctrine of divine retribution on which the otherworldliness of the Quranic teaching is founded went by the board. They seem to have fallen back on the statement that God knew by a disposition: in other words that He knew because He did know; it was dangerous to speculate further. This is a subject which calls for further investigation. CHAPTER XI. THE DIVINE WILL The first question Shahrastani debates is whether God can be said to possess will. Certain of the Mu'tazila denied this on the ground that the divine knowledge and power were sufficient. If He willed that would be mere volition. The orthodox denied the validity of the analogy, and asserted that will and knowledge were separate entities. Knowledge does not affect the known, 570</page><page sequence="21">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY whereas will does affect its object. The philosophers' theory of active knowledge is to be rejected. The second question concerned the nature of the divine will, whether it is eternal or temporal. The meaning of 'willer' is the possessor of will. The eternal is not in a place, and the divine will is not in a spatial object of the mind. (The word mutamakkin quoted in the text is an elusive term, and Shahrastani is almost certainly adopting it from Avicenna's Hudud (38) where he says in reference to a thing of the mind which has no existence, " dimensions equal to the dimensions of the mutamakkin, the localizing body, are called place into which the dimensions of the localized body (mutamakkan) can penetrate.") The Mu'tazila admitted that the idea of volitions which did not subsist in a subject was contrary to the ordinary ideas of accidents and was a tour de force. But God could not be said to will by His essence, for that would make Him responsible for crimes and evils. Nor could there be an eternal will, for that is rank dualism; nor could a temporary will subsist in God's essence nor in any other essence. Therefore it must exist not in a subject. The Ash'arites replied that to postulate volitions not in a subject was to rob them of their specific quality, and was utterly inadmissible. The third question concerned the universality of God's will. The Mu'tazila said that God willed particular acts in the sense that He created them according to His knowledge. There are some things that He does not will at all. The will could not be eternal, or it would be of universal validity, having as its object all the volitions of man including contrary wills. The Ash'arites contradicted this by showing that the eternal will must be related either to everything or to everything that is proper to it. Obviously the latter is true. Will confers specific existence and is concerned with the renewal of existence from moment to moment. There was no difficulty about the eternal will being related to two conflicting wills at the same time, for God knew which will would be realized and which would be stultified. The eternal will is only related to phenomena from one aspect, the momentary continuance of phenomena by conferring existence upon them from moment to moment. The Mu'tazila replied that if God's will is universal it is responsible for evil, whereas the Quran asserts that God does not will evil. The Ash'arites replied that the divine will simply gave existence, and existence is good. So far as mind is concerned existence is an accident. God wills the good. Evil partakes of the nature of good, and from that point of view it is willed. There is no such thing as unalloyed evil. Man wills good and evil. The Philosophers hold that evil is deprivation and lack of perfection, and only comes into existence by secondary intention. The Mu'tazila sought to prove that God does not will evil, because He has forbidden evil deeds. It cannot be said that God requires a thing and its opposite, for that would necessitate that the divine will and the divine knowledge should be in opposition, which is absurd. 571</page><page sequence="22">ALFRED GUILLAUME- The Ash'ariyya replied that this was to forget God's knowledge and it is impossible to separate the divine will from the divine knowledge. Shahrastani winds up the debate at this stage by asserting that there is a difference between the existence which the divine will accords to human act, and the character of it acquired by the human agent. Thus God creates the posture of prayer or the successive stages of pilgrimage, but it is man who becomes a worshipper and a pilgrim. The act is related to God from moment to moment. God wills it and approves it from moment to moment; but a bad action is only willed; it is not approved, that is to say it is created from moment to moment and is held to be blameworthy and punished. Thus the human act is given existence as against non-existence, and only in this sense is it willed by God. (The confusion of will with mere acquiescence here is obvious.) The debate on the subject of evil is taken up again by the philosophers who urge that there is a world movement towards the good. Evil is deficiency and privation, the loss of a thing's perfect nature. Accidental evil exists because of matter. It began through a certain disposition which prevented the proper receptiveness of perfection. Thus the object is to blame. It is better that there should be a good mixed with evil than that there should be no good at all. Shahrastani sums up by marking out a clear line between the sphere of divine predestination and human choice. The first is entirely good, the second is evil. What may seem to be evil in God's works is only relative, not absolute. At the same time the scriptural authority for a belief in evil spirits cannot lightly be set aside. Thomistic Parallels In I, Ixxii, St. Thomas argues that if there is intelligence in God He must have a will, because intellectual delight comes from the will. As we have seen in the case of the other attributes, God wills nothing but the divine essence. In willing Himself He wills everything else. The same arguments that are used of God's knowledge of particulars are used of His willing particulars without any change in His essence. As to the second point I can find no parallel to the theory of divine volitions not subsisting in a subject, except perhaps in an entirely different context, namely IV, lxv, where St. Thomas suggests that the accidents of the sacred elements remain suspended without a subject: unde relinquitur quod sint sine subjecto ... ut scilicet sola quantitas dimensiva sine subjecto subsistat. As to the third question St. Thomas shows that there is an obstacle in the way of the divine simplicity willing a multitude of particulars, as was shown above in his theory of God's essence and being. The only things that God cannot will are such as are in themselves contradictory, for that would involve willing that a thing should be and should not be at the same time, which is manifestly impossible. It is of the utmost importance to remember that God wills things in so far as they participate in His resemblance. This was the view of the 572</page><page sequence="23">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY philosophers to which Shahrastani refused to commit himself. It was not permissible to assert that God wills with a final object in view. St. Thomas agrees with the Ash'arites to some extent in that the first thing to be willed is being, because God is the source of being and being itself. Nevertheless we must not say that there was a cause for God's will, because God wills both end and act by a single will: in willing the end He wills the means; but it cannot be said that His willing the end is the cause of His willing the means. St. Thomas too agrees with much that has been said on the subject of evil in creation. The diversity of matter, and the mixture of good and evil or rather of positive good and the deprivation of perfection, constitute in a sense an insoluble problem. St. Thomas endeavours to explain it on the same lines as the Arabian philosophers: malum non est existens neque bonum; and privatio est negatio in subjecto, III, xi. Good is in a sense the cause of evil, yet God is not the cause of evil. He agrees with certain of the Muslims that the defect comes from the defective disposition of the object and God is only its cause by accident. Thus, as Shahrastani has said in other words, the good effects of a secondary cause may be attributed to God, but not its evil and imperfection. St. Thomas's example of the limping man, III, x, is worth comparing with Shahrastani's example of the man on pilgrimage. The argument is somewhat similar though the point to be illustrated is different. CHAPTERS XII AND XIII are almost exclusively Islamic in interest. They are concerned with the dogma that the Quran is eternal, pre-existing before the world, a doctrine which was taken over from Judaism (which held that the Torah pre-existed) and was strengthened and emphasized in opposition to the Christian doctrine of the Eternal Word. CHAPTER XIV deals with the nature of ordinary human speech and with psychic utterance. It contains an interesting discussion of the properties and nature of the soul which has many parallels with the S.c.G. II, vi, xv, lvi, lvii, lviii, etc. But since Shahrastani contents himself with dissenting from the views of the philosophers and expressly reserves a full discussion for another place it seems hardly fair to force a comparison between him and the Angelic Doctor. Quite clearly Shahrastani does not intend to accept the view of Avicenna that there is one possible intellect in all men (quod intellectus possibilis non est unus in omnibus hominibus). CHAPTER XV again has no real parallel in the Summa contra Gentiles. What St. Thomas has said about the divine attributes covers this discussion. The difference was one which Muslims had made for themselves. The Quran calls God a hearer and a seer. By their insistence on their Attributenlehre the Muslims had to find a real rather than a metaphorical meaning for the terms. The commonsense view is put in the foreground by Shahrastani, and he makes it plain by what he does not say rather than by what he says that he 573</page><page sequence="24">ALFRED GUILLAUME- has no great liking for the Ash'arite doctrine. Indeed it is doubtful whether the teaching had been definitely settled in his day. CHAPTER XVI. THE Visio DEI Shahrastani tells us that all parties were agreed that it was impossible to see God with the human eye. The chief question in debate was whether the apprehension which the creature hopes to attain of 'God hereafter is in any sense vision or whether it is merely an apprehension transcending knowledge. The Mu'tazila raised several objections to the vision of God in the sense of knowledge. Unless it has the same object as knowledge there would seem to be no valid ground for making a distinction between vision and knowledge. It is vain to say that the sight can perceive abstract substances. It can see only coloured objects. Again what authority is there for supposing that the sense of vision can apprehend God any more than the sense of smell or taste ? The Ash'arite replies to these objections seem to be little more than juggling with words. Shahrastani himself lifts the debate on to a higher plane in that he connects vision with revelation. God reveals Himself to men immediately by revelation by way of inspiration in the case of a prophet, mediately to the faithful as a whole. Scripture asserts the possibility of the vision of God in the story of Moses, although it does not say that Moses actually saw God. Intellectual difficulties beset the proposition, but there can be no doubt that it is a truth of dogma and it is on the whole best to refer it to the divine omniscience. Thomistic Parallels. Cf. c.Gent. III, lif. There can be little doubt that in this matter the genius of St. Thomas surpasses the best efforts of the Arabians. The belief in the visio Dei is common to both; but Shahrastani is obviously seriously shaken by the arguments of the Mu'tazila. This is the more strange because it was admitted at the outset that no question of physical sensual vision was involved (though the Mu'tazila proceeded to argue as though the contrary were admitted). The difficulty for Muslims must again be referred to their notions of the being and essence of God. They could not relate them to the creature in any way that adequately satisfied the soul's longing for God, without compromising them or rather their own doctrine of the divine nature. St. Thomas begins by asserting that that which subsists only as a form can be the form of something else if the something else can participate in it. God is pure form: other intelligibles are not. Yet they have a form in subjecto, and the divine essence can thus be compared to the human intellect. Neverthe- less no created substance can see God by its own unaided power. For the created intellect to see God the divine essence must first be united to the intellect as an intelligible form, and this can only be brought about by God Himself. The argument that no help can avail in bringing the sight, which can only see coloured objects, to see the divine substance St. Thomas meets by the 574</page><page sequence="25">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY assertion that the divine substance, being the first intelligible and the principle of knowledge, is beyond the capacity of the created intellect by degree, and divine aid alone can close the gap. However, it is doubtful whether the exposition of St. Thomas would have been satisfactory from the point of view of a Muslim. St. Thomas uses the terms lumen and visio, but he expressly states in III, lv, that this divine light is divinae cognitionis principium, and that it is the intellect which sees God. The truth would seem to be that the Muslim theologians were trying to hold two irreconcilable theses: that God could be seen literally and that He could not be seen with the eye of sense. Unless they agreed with the more intellectual members of their community that the vision was one of intellectual light (as did Ibnu-l-'Arabi, whose teaching indirectly influenced Dante pro- foundly), nothing could be done but to fall back on the authority of the Quran and abandon any attempt to find a rational explanation. CHAPTER XVII. THE NATURE OF RIGHT AND WRONG In this section of Shahrastani's work is to be found a definite breach with the tradition of Hellenism which has so strongly marked his work hitherto. According to the Muslims actions are not good or bad in themselves. Reason cannot determine what is good or what is bad. Moral values depend entirely upon the law of Islam revealed by God. There was some attempt to modify this by the assertion that knowledge comes by reason, but reason cannot impose any moral obligation on men. Thus reason does not assure us that a lie is bad and that truth is good. No appeal to man's instinctive dislike of falsehood is of any significance. What people did before the days of revelation, and how God was to reward or punish them, are matters on which we have no information, and therefore it is idle to attempt to debate them. Reason is no guide at all, because we instinctively disapprove of violent death and the destruction of property, but God evidently does not, because these things habitually occur. It is also utterly wrong to say that reason or wisdom determines God's actions, because that would make wisdom or reason greater than God. No principle, no law, no ethic can be held to fetter the absolute freedom of God to do what He likes. It is impossible to assert that God can be obeyed when He has given no law, and therefore where there is no obedience there can of necessity be no obligation on God to reward. It may be objected that such a theory abolishes the roots of jurisprudence, but this is not so. By law we punish a murderer with death, but how could we know by reason that it is more proper to destroy a second life in order to discourage violence and crime than to inflict a lesser penalty which would not cause the loss of a second life ? Moreover if moral properties in actions rested on an intellectual basis the abrogation of law, which has admittedly and rightly occurred, would be impossible. The only criterion of right and wrong is the sacred law. 575</page><page sequence="26">ALFRED GUILLAUME- Thomistic Parallels. Cf. III, cxxviiif. St. Thomas's article: Quod in humanis actibus sunt aliqua recta secundum naturam et non solum quasi lege posita, contains a clear refutation of Ash'arite teaching. He starts from the evident fact that some people are so well disposed by nature that law is not for the most part necessary for them (" The law is not made for the just but for the unjust "). The Divine Providence has endowed man with reason as the principle of his acts, and hence there are certain actions which are natural to man and right in themselves and not merely because the law prescribes them. If man has a determinant nature certain actions must needs become him. It is natural and right that a man should take suitable care of his body: the contrary is evil. Man is by nature directed to God as his proper end, and therefore good and evil in human acts are not only due to law, but also to nature. There is thus a sharp and irreconcilable opposition between the Christian and Muslim apologists on this very important subject. There is no attempt in the theology of Aquinas to fetter the independent action of God. Rather it follows from His nature and being that the intelligence which He has given to men should guide them in the attempt to imitate divine perfection. In CHAPTER XIX Shahrastani begins to apply himself to TECHNICAL TERMS IN MUSLIM THEOLOGY and to leave the larger questions of philosophy. The first question whether God's acts have a purpose was one which the Mu'tazila pushed to dangerous extremes. Their doctrine that God must do what is best for men was obviously not capable of demonstration, because particular and universal good in this world are often in sharp opposition. The orthodox view was that no efficient cause prompted God to create the universe. God does work for the good of man but no reason can be assigned for His act. Purpose is only possible where the agent seeks advantage. God cannot reap advantage from anything, and if it is said that He seeks the advant- age of others are we to suppose that this vast creation came about in order that man might find God ? In fact no reasonable motive can be assigned for the creation of the world. The Creator cannot be interrogated about His actions. Thomistic Parallels. Cf. II, xxiii. As this chapter deals with a variety of subjects it seems best to set the Christian and Muslim views side by side subject by subject. The problem is stated in different terms in the Summa c. Gent.; the conclu- sions reached are sometimes similar, sometimes contradictory. St. Thomas uses the expression necessitas naturae and denies its application to God. We are not to suppose that God is restricted like a natural cause which always has the same effect. It is God's will that determines His action. Here, of course, St. Thomas is in agreement, so far as the conclusion is concerned, with Shahrastani. But the intellect of God (which Shahrastani would insist upon calling knowledge) is also concerned in His action, and it must needs be that 576</page><page sequence="27">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY He works for an end or the universe would have been the result of chance. This is the point which Shahrastani has missed. Obviously a thing cannot be directed to an end unless the agent knows the end, and the means to the end, and thus God works by intelligence and will. Nevertheless the opposition between the two writers is not so strong as would appear, because neither would admit that God acted by knowledge and intelligence as interpreted by man, but by divine knowledge or intelligence. For St. Thomas goes on to say (xxiv) that God works according to His (suam) wisdom, and this wisdom is not to be identified with human wisdom. The insistence on the divine wisdom rather than abstract wisdom in this chapter is most marked. III, xcvii, is one of the most interesting chapters in the Summa c. Gent. for our purpose, as it is the one that contains a definite reference to the doctrines of the Mutakallimiin with whom we have been dealing. Here it is shown that the arrangement of the universe has been brought about for a definite reason. God directs all things to His goodness as their end. Not as though His good- ness gained anything (a point which the Muslims urged against purpose, arguing that purpose implied an expectation of profit), but that the likeness of His goodness might be impressed on all things. St. Thomas accounts for the multiplicity of things by the theory that they were better fitted to represent the perfection of the divine goodness. This argument is developed with all St. Thomas's power of illustration and reasoning. The divine intelligence and the divine goodness caused diversity in things; but although the divine goodness is the cause of the creation of things they depend on the simple will of God, so that the reason of things presupposes the divine will. Accordingly the two errors are refuted: (1) the error of the Mutakallimin, who assert that the sole reason why fire heats rather than chills is because God so wills; and (2) the assertion that the ordering of causes proceeds from the divine providence by way of necessity. SHAHRASTANI ON GRACE The Ash'ariyya held that Grace was a special power created by God by which men obeyed Him and chose to obey Him. Like all the objects of God's creation it is renewed from moment to moment. But grace has its opposite: khidhldn (lit. " abandoning "), the creation of the power to disobey. The Mu'tazila held that grace is the manifestation of signs in creation by which we can infer God's existence. Revelation is lutf, sufficient grace. Those who took a middle course held that all men were partakers of grace in the Mu'tazilite sense, but that particular individuals received a special grace in that God causes them to trust in Him. Khidhldn, abandoning, means that God leaves them to their own devices. God sets the seal on wilful blindness and insensibility to His grace. Thomistic Parallels. Cf. III, cxlviii. Grace is God's assistance. There is no element of compulsion in it. The aim 577</page><page sequence="28">ALFRED GUILLAUME- of grace is almost the same in Muslim as in Christian theology, though its expression is different. In Christian theology emphasis is laid on man's beatitude in God. In Muslim theology the emphasis is placed rather on obedience and the reward that obedience secures. St. Thomas, like Shahrastani, teaches that certain individuals receive a special grace. The idea corresponding to khidhlan-the 1yKaraEAECb0 of St. John of Damascus-is to be found in clxi (though I cannot find that St. Thomas uses a special word for it). We cannot inquire why God converts some by his pre- venient grace and allows others to continue sinning, for this depends on His simple will. CHAPTER XIX. THE EVIDENTIAL NATURE OF MIRACLES AND THE IMPECCA- BILITY OF PROPHETS. It is unfortunate that the Summa c. Gent. contains no parallel to the extremely interesting discussion on the evidential character of miracles. Two objections raised by the Mu'tazilites and others are often precisely those which modern minds feel, and it would have been of more than academic interest to see how St. Thomas would reply to them. To Christians Shahrastani's point of view is instructive in that it shows how miracles had come to be the criterion of a prophet's truth. As we have seen, St. Thomas in the beginning of the Summa starts from the assumption that Muhammad did not perform any miracles save the alleged miracle of the Quran. This is historically true. Muhammad himself denied that he could give any supernatural sign, save that of his message. But in intercourse with Christians Muhammadans felt themselves at a disadvantage in this matter, and so traditions were forged in the name of Muhammad's immediate followers which showed him in the light of an equal or even superior to our Lord. Had St. Thomas known of this alleged power in Muhammad he would no doubt have devoted some space tb a discussion of it. St. Thomas deals with miracles in III, ci, but not in a way that is pertinent to Shahrastani's arguments. There is a considerable difference between his miraculum and Shahrastani's mu'jiza, which means something that makes attempts at imitation impotent. The miracle is something at which we wonder: the mu'jiza something which rival claimants are impotent to copy. The first describes perfectly the effect of our Lord's miracles of healing on the beholders; the second exactly fits Moses' ascending scale of mu'jizat in which he first performed signs that could be imitated, until at last he produced the complete mu'jiza when his rod swallowed up the rods of the Egyptian magicians. This story, it will be remembered, appears in the Quran as well as in the Old Testament. The mechanical theory of miracles in Islam is naive: God is believed to produce a miracle " to order ", as though from behind a curtain an invisible presence produced a portent on the application of a prophet. With Shahrastani St. Thomas would seem to admit that magicians have a certain power in nature, but it is a much more guarded admission than that 578</page><page sequence="29">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY made by Shahrastani's opponents. He denies that they can do more than any rational person, though they do acquire exceptional influence through the demons to whom they appeal. Nevertheless all are subject to the power and providence of God. He and Shahrastani are in agreement that sorcery and the kindred arts are full of trickery and are marked by extravagancies of voice and gesture. They have nothing in common with such miracles as raising the dead. CHAPTER XX. THE RESURRECTION This last chapter on dogmatic theology is obviously less to the author's taste than the more philosophical questions he has hitherto discussed. He has two points to make about the resurrection: first that it is a resurrectio corporum; and secondly that the soul returns in the order of merit in which it left the body. The doctrine of Muslim and Christian is almost identical here. Both assert that the human soul is immaterial, that it is naturally united to the body and must needs be reunited to it. The natural union of soul and body demands the future resurrection of the body. Both appeal to faith as well as to reason and to the fact that without a resurrection there can be no proper scale of rewards and punishments. The fable of the interrogation in the tomb by two angels (Munkar and Nakir) is a popular development of a legend at one time current among the Jews.l It is to be compared with the statement: quod animae statim post separationem a corpore poenam vel praemium consequuntur (IV, xci). The discussions which follow on the mythology of the Muhammadan paradise may be passed over, as well as the purely theological question as to the content of faith: what is a Muslim, and to what extent can a nominal assent to the verities of the faith be accepted, etc. ? THE IMAMATE has often been erroneously compared with the Papal office in Christianity, perhaps not so erroneously as many Orientalists suppose. If the pope has abandoned all claim to territorial and civil jurisdiction there is no analogy, but if the pope may call men to a Crusade, there is an obvious connexion between the two offices. However, the theory and progress of the two institu- tions do not call for notice here. They concern a controversy which had not arisen in an acute form in St. Thomas's day, as do such matters as the authority of tradition, of the individual conscience, the equality of all believers, catholic consent, etc. In these matters Islam reached a crisis centuries before the Reformation. Conclusion Enough has now been said to enable the reader to form his own opinion of the justice of the claim that the Summa contra Gentiles was not a success, and in the nature of the case, never could be. Its merit as an exposition of the 1 It is found in one of the later collections of tradition. 579</page><page sequence="30">CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM THEOLOGY Christian faith is beyond all praise: as an essay in Christian apologetic contra Mauros it falls under serious criticism. So much has been said in the comparison of the chapters seriatim, so much lies unanswered and unheeded in Shahrastani's work, that there can be no doubt that St. Thomas lacked the training of an Arabist without which it is unwise to engage in argument with Muslims. The principle on which Aquinas relied in addressing himself to Muslims, namely the appeal to natural reason, was not one which would be accepted as the basis of discussion by the Ash'ariyya. The function of reason was to register, as it were, the decisions of the sacred law. Though Aquinas marks out plainly the function of reasoning in relation to our thought about God, it cannot, I think, be held that the two rival religions are brought face to face and com- pelled to consider each other's arguments. Neither writer can be said to represent Christianity or Islam completely and without all controversy, but it is questionable whether a better champion could be evoked from either camp. In venturing to criticize one whose name is revered throughout Christendom on one single point I am bound to point out that none since his day has put, or attempted to put, Christian faith and worship so comprehensively before the Muslim world. The vast importance of creating sympathy and understanding between these two great groups of theists should be apparent to all. St. Thomas had one great advantage over a modern writer: he moved in the same circle of ideas as his would-be converts. Aristotle and even his Arabian commentators were authorities common to both parties. A modern scholar, unless perhaps a seminarist, breathes this atmosphere as one from another world. Modern science, physics, biology, astronomy, and especially modern psychology and modern criticism of the Bible, have profoundly modified his view of the activity of God and the mode of His revelation. Yet somewhere there must be a man who could take up the work which the saint addressed to thirteenth-century Muslims and relate it more closely to Muslim faith and belief, while taking into account the intellectual achievements of our own age and time. 580</page></plain_text>
