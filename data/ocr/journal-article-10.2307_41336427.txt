Barman2, T. A. Shepley-James1 and B. P. White1 Natural Science Department, Georgia Military College, Warner Robins, GA 31093 department of Biological &amp; Environmental Science, Georgia College &amp; State University, Milledgeville, GA 31061 Abstract The first instar of Matus ovatus Leech is described and illustrated. The analysis of the pri- mary chaetotaxy of legs, head, and last abdominal segment of M. ovatus revealed no signif- icant differences between this species and the previously described M. bicarinatus. Undescribed primary anatomical features of the tribe Matini presented herein include (1) a tentative identification of anterior tentorial pits and fragments of the anterior tentorial arms, (2) anterior protergal modifications and chaetotaxy, and (3) complete sclerotization of the seventh abdominal segment. Differences in mandibular morphology permit identifica- tion of first instars of M. ovatus and M. bicarinatus in the eastern United States. Key Words: Matus ovatus, larval morphology, immature stage, Dytiscidae Resumen Primer estadio de Matus ovatus Leech se de describen e ilustran. El análisis de la quetotaxia principa de las piernas, la cabeza, y el ultimo segmento abdominal de M. ovatus no revélo di- ferencias significativas entre esta especia y la na descrito anteriormente M. bicarinatus. No descritos características anatómicas primaria de la tribu Matini presentaron en el presente incluyen (1) Una identificación provisional de pozos tentorial anterior y fragmentos de los brazos tentorial anterior, (2) protergal modificaciones anterior y quetotaxia, y (3) escleroti- zación completa del séptimo segmento abdominal. Las diferencias en la morfología de la mandíbula permitir la identificación del primer estadio de M. ovatus y M. bicarinatus en el este de Estados Unidos. Translation provided by the authors. Matus Aubé, endemic to North America, in- cludes 4 species, M. bicarinatus (Say), M. leechi Young; M. ovatus Leech, and M. relictus Young (Young 1953; Larson et al. 2000). Detailed de- scriptions of third instars of Matus ovatus Leech (Wolfe &amp; Roughley 1985), second instars M. lee- chi , and first, second, and third instars of M. bi- carinatus (Alarie 1995, 1998; Alarie et al. 2001) are available. Analyses of first instar (primary) morphology has provided information for the de- velopment and testing of systematic hypotheses (e.g., Nilsson 1988; Alarie 1995, 1998; Alarie et al. 2001, 2002, 2009). However, primary morphology is available only for M. bicarinatus. The objective of this study was to provide the results of an anal- ysis of external morphology of the heretofore un- described first instar of M. ovatus that is inclusive of, but not restricted to, chaetotaxy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Larvae described were collected between 31V 2007 and 5 VT 2007 from a marsh site in Monroe County, (N33°6.47', W83°47.89'), GA, USA. Lar- vae were identified as M. ovatus on the basis of distribution records (Turnbow &amp; Smith 1983), as- sociations with third instars described by Wolfe &amp; Roughley (1985), and by comparison to descrip- tions of first instars of M. bicarinatus (Alarie 1995, 1998; Alarie et al. 2001). Descriptions are based on 10 (unless otherwise specified) first instars randomly selected from a larger cohort preserved in 70% glycerated alcohol. Head lengths were measured dorsally from the posterior margin of the head capsule along the coronal suture to the anterior margin of the fron- toclypeus, excluding the frontoclypeal sensilla. Head widths were measured dorsally from the widest point. Gape measurements were taken ventrally from the center of the ball of the right and left mandibular articulations, and mandibu- lar length was measured ventrally from the apex of the mandible to the center of the ball of articu- lation (Wall et al. 2006). Because of the pseudo- chelate structural modifications, 2 lengths were taken for each pro- and mesothoracic tibia. One length was determined by measuring each from its articulation with the femur to its abutment with the tarsus, and a second length was taken that included the tibial extensions resulting in</page><page sequence="2">440 Fionda Entomologist 94(3) September 2011 the pseudo-chelate modifications. Measurements for all other structures were taken along either the greatest lengths or greatest widths. Total leg lengths were calculated based on the sums of the lengths of the coxae, femora, tibiae (excluding lengths that included pseudo-chelate modifica- tions), and tarsi. Identification and coding of primary sensilla was based on Nilsson (1988) and Alarie (1995, 1998). Other morphometric terminology utilized is based on Snodgrass (1935), Bousquet &amp; Goulet (1984), and Larson et al. (2000). Description of the First Instar of M. ovatus (Figs. 1-3) Body.

Abdomen: Segments 1-5 sclerotized dorsally, segment 6 sclerotized dorsally and laterally below dorsopleural line, otherwise membranous; seg- ments 1-6 each with prominent antecostal suture and bearing long, broadly dispersed, robust sen- silla; segments 7 and 8 heavily and completely sclerotized, dorsal length of segment 8, 0.92-1.30 mm (x = 1.18 ± 0.12 mm), siphon length 0.38-0.62 mm (x = 0.54 ± 0.08 mm). Urogomphus One-seg- mented, length 0.48- 0.60 mm (x = 0.55 ± 0.05 mm). Chaetotaxy. Primary ancestral and additional sensilla in general as attributed to M. bicarinatus on legs, last abdominal segments, urogomphi (Alarie 1995; Alarie et al. 2001), cranium, and cranial appendages (Alarie 1998; Alarie et al. 2001). Differences between M. ovatus and M. bi- carinatus include: Mandible, MNb not found; fe- mur with 2 additional AV primary sensilla; me- sofemoral FE5 short and spine-like, vs. elongate and hair-like (Alarie 1995), or coded for phyloge- netic analyses as short and spine-like (Alarie et al. 2001). Bionomics. First instars of M. ovatus were present in small numbers between 25 IV 2008 and 7 VI 2008 in localized areas of a relatively large anthropomorphic marsh. Mature larvae of Hydrovatus sp. indet. were frequently collected along with the Matus larvae. This lentie system supported dense populations of aquatic macro- phytes, including Egeria densa Planchón and Al- ternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb., with large amounts of sedimentary and detrital mate- rials suspended in the water column. The tempo- ral distribution of larvae indicates that M. ovatus commenced oviposition at this site in late Apr and that this activity continued until at least early Jun. Discussion Structures present on first instars of M. ovatus but not reported for M. bicarinatus because of ex- perimental design or objectives (Alarie 1995, 1998; Alarie et al 2001) include (1) apparent ante- rior tentorial pits (Fig. 1) on or near the clypeola- bral suture (Snodgrass 1935), (2) an anterior pro- tergal inflection (Fig. 4) that appears to accommo- date an articulation of the roughly ovoid cranium with the protergum; and (3) robust anterolateral protergal sensilla that may be homologous to those reported for first instars of Carabidae (Bousquet &amp; Goulet 1984). The seventh abdomi- nal segment of M. ovatus is completely sclero- tized. However, the seventh abdominal segment of Matini larvae, including M. bicarinatus , was described (Alarie et al. 2001) as having a ventral plate distinct from the tergite. In southeastern Canada and the U.S. east of the Mississippi River (Larson et al. 2000; Epier 2010), larvae with pseudo-chelate tibial modifica-</page><page sequence="4">442 Florida Entomologist 94(3) September 2011 tions, crania that are less than 0.8 mm in width, and frontoclypeal egg bursters, but with neither temporal spines nor spiracles, will be first instars of either M. ovatus or M. bicarinatus. Mandibles of first instars of M. bicarinatus possess multiple teeth on the ventromedial surface (Alarie 1998; Alarie et al. 2001), whereas first instars of M. ova- tus possess a single prominent tooth with an occa- sional minute proximate tooth or teeth on some specimens (Fig. 3). This provides an accessible and objective non-chaetotaxal character for iden- tification of first instars of M. ovatus and M. bi- carinatus within the geographic limits noted above.
