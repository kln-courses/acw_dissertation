<plain_text><page sequence="1">83 SOME ANCIENT METAL BELTS: THEIR ANTECEDENTS AND RELATIVES By P. R. S. Moorey In a country like Iran, where the output of ancient metalsmiths never ceases to surprise by its vigour and variety, consideration of any individual items in their repertoire inevitably involves a whole complex of problems.' The three objects to be discussed in this paper are united by function and to some extent by form, but in style they reflect three distinct cultural milieu. It is hoped that by examining each piece in detail some light may be thrown first on the interrelation of metal workshops in Western Iran in the period immediately preceding the genesis of the Achaemenian style and secondly, in considering the silver gilt belt, on the Achaemenians' legacy to the Asiatic periphery of their Empire. As no general survey of evidence for the history of the metal belt in the ancient Near East is at present available, the main discussion is prefaced by a brief review of evidence for its development in this area before the eighth century B.c., to set the objects under consideration in their widest context. I Evidence for the history of the metal belt takes three main forms : belts found in situ on skeletons, pictorial or sculptural representations of belts and detached fragments of sheet metal. Except when found in situ the evidence is usually far from satisfactory. Representations of belts in art, however skil- fully drawn, rarely make clear beyond all doubt whether the belt is made of metal or fabric and usually leave details of fastening and decoration obscure. Detached metal plaques may well have served a multitude of functions and their use as belt fittings is never more than one among a number of possi- bilities. The same is to some extent true of continuous strips of sheet metal and it is here that considera- tions of size play an important part in their identification. The great length and height of certain " belts " reported from Urartian sites indicates that they are better identified as decorative fittings for furniture or chariots.2 It is less easy to define the dimensional limit between a " diadem " and a " belt ", when there is clear evidence from Crete in the second millennium B.c.3 that extremely constricting metal belts were quite commonly worn. Wasp-waisted statuettes from Western Asia suggest that metal belts were quite often short and that a length between sixteen and twenty inches does not necessarily indicate a " diadem ", particularly when the band of metal is three or more inches high. The ends of metal belts may often not have met round the waist. As with so many metal artefacts later to become characteristic of the Western Asiatic tradition, the earliest available evidence for metal belts was found in two late Early Dynastic III graves at Ur. In grave PG/58o " lay what had been a belt or baldric of leather plated with silver "4 attached to it was a mounted cylinder seal (U.934I) and a gold dagger with its sheath (U.936 I). In the grave of Mes-kalam- dug (PG/755) were the traces of an identical belt which had once carried a cylinder seal, a dagger and perhaps a whetstone and toilet reticule.5 These two graves establish at the outset a close link between the metal belt and military equipment. In Sumer, from at least the late prehistoric period, the woven girdle appears to have had a distinct ritual significance6 and even in the early historic period the multiple woven girdle appears only on nude statues, in metal and stone, designed to carry or support objects as part of the temple furniture.' Although they carry military equipment, the nude male i My thanks are due to R. W.

The next stage in the history of the metal belt is confused by the fact that certain objects found out of context have been identified as metal belts when they are more probably " diadems ". At Byblos, in late third millennium B.c. contexts-the Egyptian First Intermediate Period-Montet found a very fine complete rectangular strip of silver with both ends rolled back and fragments of others in " founda- tion deposits ".9 It is clear from their size and form that these pieces are probably not belts. The dis- covery of an identical object of copper still in place on the skull of a skeleton in a ninth dynasty burial at Qau in Egypt endorses their identity as " diadems ".'~ Such objects were not confined to Egypt and the Levant, for the ruler portrayed in the well-known bronze head from Nineveh" wears such a diadem, with the ends rolled back, to support the large curls into which his hair is dressed across the brow. A number of sheet metal fragments from Alaga Huyuk in Anatolia may have served a similar function." True metal belts may be represented by thin gold sheets on two silver statuettes of the early second millennium B.c. found by Schaeffer at Ras Shamra.'3 The first evidence for the round-ended metal belt, which was to become the most common type throughout the Near East, was found in Tomb J3 at Jericho.'4 This fragmentary bronze belt is decorated with a repousse' pattern of concentric circles and bosses. It was fastened by passing a tie through metal loops set back from either end of the belt. The decoration is almost certainly a reproduction entirely in metal of a leather belt fortified with circular metal discs.'5 A better preserved, but plain belt, of the same general type was found in tomb A at Tell Far'ah in Jordan.'6 Though that at Jericho is slightly earlier than the one at Far'ah, both graves belong to the local Middle Bronze Age IIB, c. 1750-1650 B.c. Both belts were associated with the burial of a single individual whose equipment- a battle-axe and dagger-and skeleton proclaimed him to be a young warrior. The form and fastening of these belts is clearly represented on the approximately contemporary " Stele of Baal " from Ras Shamra.'7 During the Late Bronze Age in the Levant and Anatolia representations of what are certainly metal belts increase, but the archaeological evidence is as scanty as ever. A number of statuettes of Hittite manufacture show the metal belt with curved ends worn by warriors. On the figure on the King's Gate at Boghaz-k6y,'8 a bronze statuette from Latakia'9 and an ivory from Nuzi'0 the belt appears to be kept in place by its own elasticity, but on a bronze statuette from Boghaz-k6y2" in the same style as that from Latakia, the belt is tied with thongs. In contrast an actual belt of the period, excavated at Boghaz-kdy, appears to have been fastened with a hook and eye.2" This very interesting object is made of a thin silver sheet encased in two sheets of bronze with a sunk design of interlocking spirals picked out in gold wire on the outer surface. Belts with rounded ends were used in North Syria at this time"3 and fragments of such a belt were found at Ras Shamra.'4 Further to the east, at Susa, a round ended belt, presumably of metal, is worn by a small figure in ivory, of uncertain sex, found in the Elamite levels of the "Ville Royale ". The context suggests a date at the end of the second 8 R. J. Braidwood, Excavations in the Plain of Antioch, I, 1960, fig. 240-2-Phase " G ". The representation of the belts is very schematic ; it is possible that they have metal clasps. 9 H. Hubert, Syria, VI, 1925, fig. I ; Montet, Byblos et l'Egypt, pl. LXVIII, 579, 580-6.

In the course of his clearance of room AB in the N.W. Palace at Nimrud in 185 I Layard found " two long ornamented bands of copper, rounded at both ends, apparently belts, such as were worn by warriors in armour ".26 These belts probably belong to the reign of Sargon (721-705 B.C.) or his successors. To judge from Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs they were common pieces of military equipment from at least the reign of Assurnasirpal II (883-859 B.C.) for heavily armoured troops."7 The other belts on these reliefs, as on those at Carchemish28 and Sinjirli'9 are apparently of leather or cloth with rounded end and tapes or clasps to fasten them. Certain contemporary North Syrian representations may show metal belts.3s It is also reasonable to suppose that an as yet unknown Levantine prototype inspired the makers of girdles like that found in tomb P at Fortetsa in Crete.3' In Urartu a number of metal strips have been excavated in graves which were evidently those of soldiers.32 Some indeed were probably belts, like those of Transcaucasia, but others are certainly too large and may have been decorative fittings for chariots.33 During the late eighth century and early seventh century a form of metal belt with elaborate hook clasp was used in Phrygia and Ionia, but its relation to metal belts further east is still obscure, as comparable fittings are not yet known on Urartian belts.34 A simple hook seems to have prevailed there.35 Apart from Iran, Caucasia has produced the widest range of metal belts yet found in the Near East. According to de Morgan36 sheet bronze belt fittings are confined to the Iron Age, not only in Talish, but in the whole of Transcaucasia. In Talish the belts are made of separate plaques of metal set side by side on a leather backing or of long sheets of metal with similar backing. There seems to be no evidence in Talish for the finely chased decoration found on belts in Transcaucasia. In his excavations in Russian Armenia de Morgan found a similar range of belts in situ, but only on male skeletons.37 As swords and daggers were always carried between body and belt they are clearly military equipment, as was often the case in the Levant. De Morgan classified the belts he found at Akthala, Sadakhlo and Mouci-Yeri into three main groups. The most recent were the most elaborately decorated with chased geometric and figure-designs. They were large, reaching 19 cm. in height and varying in length from 88 to 92 cm. The earlier belts were smaller, thinner and less ornate. They were all fastened by a leather thong passed through a pair of holes pierced in either end. One cast belt with a hook was found at Akthala, similar to Koban forms of the eighth to seventh century B.C.38 In addition to the decorated belts found by de Morgan in western Russian Armenia, another group, from the eastern part of the same area, was fully published by Virchow in I895.39 These belts are 70-90 cm. long and 8-15 cm. broad. The ends are rounded, rarely straight, and pierced with one or three holes. Though the technique of decoration is the same in both eastern and western Russian Armenia, the subject matter varies and the style is slightly different. In the west animals and human figures, as on the Akthala belts, are highly conventionalized with very geometric or angular profiles. The body areas are filled overall with chased zigzag lines and dots. By contrast the Virchow group have animals, though still slightly conventionalized, rendered in lively, contorted forms. Their bodies are drawn with a narrow perimeter margin filled with incised lines. Within the margin the body surface is divided into carefully delineated areas filled with blocks of semi-circular lines or bands of dashes. Though the forms are not so stylized and the body patterning less intense on West Iranian metal belts there is a distinct 25 M.D.P., XXV, 1934, pl. X 4, 5 ; p. 208-9. 26 A. H.

In many ways even closer to the Iranian belts with zoomorphic decoration is a belt from a tomb at Maralyn Deresi in the Trialeti district4o decorated in two registers with a hunting scene. It will be easier to assess the relation between these Caucasian belts and those of north-west Iran when the belts reported from Marlik4' and Hasanlu4' are fully published. A metal belt from the Japanese excavations in Dailaman indicates that the relationship may well prove to be very close.43 II Belt No. I (Ashmolean Museum 1965.833)44--Plate Ib As in the following example the belt is made of a single strip of sheet metal, about 49 5 cm. long, 6 -75 cm. high. Each end is cut to form a double-spiral. A single, small hole is pierced through either end of the belt at the base of the spiral to take a cord or wire for fastening the belt. On the upper and lower edge there is a margin of repoussi dots in a double row, broken only above and below the central floral motif. At either end of the belt the dots are arranged in triple lines. Within this frame is a chased design of two gazelles grazing, one behind the other, on either side of a central " tree". The hide of each animal is decorated overall with tiny sets of double lines. Only the shoulder, marked out by a double line, and the rib cage are specially emphasized. The ringed horns and the short tail ending in a tuft, characteristic of the gazelle, are clearly shown. The central lotus flower rises from a sub-circular core set on a low trunk. In the flower five leaves are set on either side, curving away from three pointed petals in the centre. Fig. I. Belt No. II (Ashmolean Museum 1965.834a, b)-Plate Ia This belt is made from a single strip of sheet metal six centimetres high and at least 57 centimetres long. One end is broken off and does not join the main piece exactly, though it is certainly part of the same belt. Both ends are cut as double spirals. At either end of the belt, set at right angles to the terminals, is a male figure with arms raised on either side of his head, very simply rendered in repousse'. He stands on a row of four repousse' blobs and the field behind him is decorated with tiny punched holes. An exactly similar figure appears in the central panel of the belt, but this time set parallel to the terminals, framed on either side by a double row of four repousse' blobs. The area between these figures is filled by three horizontal repoussi lines, marked out by rows of small punched holes. 4o B. A. Kuftin, Archaeological Excavations in Trialeti, I, I941, pl.

The distinctive terminals of these two metal belts may be paralleled exactly in the cemetery at Khurvin.45 A complete belt and a fragment of another (Plate Ic) reported without exact provenance from Luristan, have double-spiral terminals and a very simple design of four horizontal rows of repouss6 blobs along the belt.46 Analysis of the fragment has shown that it is definitely bronze not copper.47 There seems no reason to doubt the reported source of these two belts. A number of sheet metal brace- lets with double-spiral terminals have been reported from Luristan, some of them from the earliest period of clandestine excavation in the area.4' One set of these bracelet terminals49 indisputably links this particular type of sheet metal bracelet to the cast bronze work most characteristic of Luristan in the eighth and seventh centuries B.c.50 This pair of terminals are decorated in repoussd with a pair of opposed rampant " lions " rendered in the exotic style reserved for this beast in the whole range of Luristan cast bronze work at this time. Characteristic of it are the raised coils which frame the eyes and form the jaw. In cast bronze they reflect the original wax model, but they passed into the chased and repousse designs on sheet metal as a purely decorative device.5' Flat-headed pins, their heads cut in a double-spiral, have also been reported from Luristan.52 Such pins have distinct Caucasian affinities.53 Double spiral bracelets are typical of the Koban culture in the early first millennium B.C., but apart from an example reported from the Lechkhum hoard54 are very rare in Transcaucasia. It is possible that the cast bronze belt buckles from Koban,55 with spiral terminals, mark the final stage in the history of this fashion in Caucasia. The geometric simplicity of the design on belt II is unlike the decoration found on belts from Luristan, to be discussed later, or that on the many sheet metal vessels now known from sites in North- West Persia, which normally have elaborate overall designs in which men and animals, vividly rendered, play an equal part."6 The posture of the naked man, however, indicates that the belt is Iranian, comparable in date to the one reported from Khurvin. This distinctive pose, with arms raised on either side of the head, is assumed by figures dressed in long robes represented on unprovenanced seals of 45 Vanden Berghe, La Ne'cropole de Khurvin, pl.

A similar gesture is some- times adopted by the " master or mistress-of-animals " on bronzes produced in Luristan about the same time."8 A bronze statuette of a warrior reported from Khurvin is shown in this position.59 It is probably a gesture of worship, or perhaps of mourning.6o Some of the female figurines from Piravend6' are cast in the same position, but in this case there is reason to believe it may be a posture associated with childbirth, as elsewhere in the ancient Near East.6' It is unfortunate that the date, often even the authenticity, of a wide variety of anthropomorphic metal figurines reported from Caucasia is in doubt, for crudely cast male figures with their arms raised appear frequently among them.63 The other belt (I) may be more readily attributed than its companion. An identical " tree " appears on a silver vessel reported to be from Ziwiyeh.64 Allowing for the difference in material, virtually identical renderings of the gazelle appear on a number of the ivory plaques reported from the same site.65 It seems likely that these ivories were not made in the Assyrian workshops which produced the ivories in a " Neo-Assyrian " style found in Assyrian palace excavations,66 for though motifs are often very similar certain points of style and technique suggest provincial workmanship.67 An even more definitely Iranian workshop is represented at Ziwiyeh by another group of ivories. The iconography still owes something to Neo-Assyrian patterns, but the designs are executed in a manner which has little regard for form or proportion. They follow an independent Iranian tradition of ivory and wood carving represented by finds in level IV at Hasanlu,68 c. 900-800 B.C., where the same distinctive human type also appears. Such parallels suggest a date in the eighth century for the belt. There is no reason to suppose its companion (belt II) as other than approximately contemporary. Belt number I is important as direct evidence for Neo-Assyrian influence on local Iranian smiths working in base metals. Although the motif is clearly Neo-Assyrian in origin, both the execution of the design and the object to which it is applied are part of the Iranian tradition of metal working. This is not an isolated phenomenon. A small bronze ritual bucket, now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and a number of other vessels without exact provenance from this area69 clearly illustrate the currency of Neo-Assyrian iconography in local workshops. As with the ivories from Ziwiyeh small departures from the Assyrian artistic canon reveal the hand of provincial craftsmen: the scale of the constituent parts of a motif are altered for dramatic effect, details of dress and hairstyle are modified and the floral motifs are less formalized than their Assyrian prototypes. As so little decorated metal work, which may certainly be ascribed to local workshops, has been reported from sites in Assyria,7" we remain ignorant of its main styles and forms; but there seems little doubt from what we have, and from the evidence of the " Neo-Assyrian " ivories from Nimrud, that in style and iconography the minor arts closely followed the canon found in the monumental sculptured reliefs. In Iran the finds in level IV at Hasanlu and at Ziwiyeh, as well as a number of other sites still to be identified, indicate the extent to which vigorous indigenous traditions of craftsmanship in ivory, wood, metal and baked clay, with a long history only partially revealed at Marlik, were subject to the influence of craftsmen and imported objects from Assyria and Syria. A parallel phenomenon on Assyria's western frontier has long been clear.7' As in Syria, the process began in Persia in the second 57 M. and L-H. Erlenmeyer, Iranica Antiqua, V, 1965, pp. I ff ; pl.

Zamua, the vassal state closest to Ziwiyeh, had been incorporated into the Assyrian system c. 856 B.C.73 by Shalmaneser III and formed a vital source of'horses for the Assyrian armies until the third quarter of the seventh century B.C. Throughout the intervening years political and diplomatic activity no doubt stimulated a vigorous trade between the Assyrian homeland and the tributary states on the eastern frontier. The gazelles on this belt, and those on the Ziwiyeh ivories, are closely paralleled on a sheet metal belt reported from Luristan to the south.74 A number of other belts and sheet metal fittings which may come from belts have been reported from this very important centre of bronze production. These metal belts are usually decorated in repousse with chased details. Small punched holes of varying disposition round the perimeter of the surviving fragments show that they were often stitched to a backing of leather or fabric. If original, the plain wire loop on a belt in the Voss collection75 sug- gests a very primitive form of fastening with hook and eye, though no trace of the former survives. A very similar form of fastening exists on an Early Iron Age sheet metal belt from Cyprus.76 The plain curved or flat metal ends surviving on a number of the Luristan belts and fragments, without any evidence for cast buckles" or hooks and eyes, may mean they were retained in position by their own elasticity. The belts from Luristan may provisionally be divided into three main groups. In the first group78 the use of gold and silver, rare among the sheet metal work reported from Luristan, marks their affinity to artefacts from north-west Iran where the use of precious metals is much more common. The iconography of these belts lends additional weight to this suggestion. They are decorated with scenes which might loosely be described as ritual presentation processions. They consist of self-contained groups, either variants of the " master-of-animals " theme or groups of offering- bearers, arranged in a continuous frieze. Characteristic of the figures on these belts, and the related flat-headed pins with circular heads, are their angular movements, the hair swept up at the back, long robes with tasselled girdle and hem, and a facial type distinguished by prominent straight noses, large eyes, thin lips and straggly beards. Identical figures appear on ivories in a local style from level IV at Hasanlu79 and the Ziwiyeh hoard.8s Such parallels are very important for the chronology of this sheet metal work in Luristan."8 Carbon 14 determinations indicate that level IV at Hasanlu82 ended c. 800 B.C.; the ivories were probably produced sometime in the preceding half century. In the same level were found a group of " Syrian style ivories of the Loftus group ".83 It has been suggested by a number of scholars that the ivories from Ziwiyeh in a Neo-Assyrian style were made in the second half of the eighth century B.C.84 The local ivories found with them may then be later than those from Hasanlu, but not significantly so. As the evidence stands at the moment it is probable that the sheet metal work associated with the shrine at Dum Surkh and from elsewhere in Luristan may be dated to the eighth or early seventh centuries B.C. 72 Although much attention has been paid to when and why the Ziwiyeh hoard was buried-see L.

In discussing the Luristan evidence I include only the rectangular metal strips whose length and height suggest belts ; among a great variety of smaller sheet metal plaques reported from the region there may well be some which are belt fittings, but it is now impossible to identify them with certainty. 76 Myres, Cesnola Collection, 1914, No. 4755, fig. on p. 489. 77 Ghirshman, Persia from the Origins to Alexander, fig. 510 pub- lished a fitting of this kind said to be from Luristan.

The primary motifs are scenes of war and hunting, with the individual animals or heraldic groups of " hero and beasts " found so often on the cast " standard-finials " and openwork pinheads from Luristan. There is no trace of the ritual scenes of the previous group. This may well signify the distinction between objects of daily use and decorative fittings for the ceremonial garments of priests ; a difference in part reflected in the change from a base to a precious metal. The belts in this group, like those from the Caucasus, may be regarded as the equipment of soldiers and huntsmen. A belt of this type is reported from clandestine excavations in what may have been a mountain shrine at Tang-i-Hamamlan in Hulailan, Luristan.86 Though isolated indications appear-the characteristic lion mask found both on the flat-headed disk-pins"7 and the belt in Berlin88-there are too few motifs in common and no prominent stylistic affinity between these belts and the decorated disk-pins to allow for certainty over a common centre of production. If it may be assumed that the " Dum Surkh style ", characterized by elaborately decorated bronze disk-pins, developed in south Luristan89 not too far distant from the shrine itself, these belts may be more closely associated with workshops in Hulailan to the north. The finest of them,90 now in the Louvre, has clear affinities of style and iconography with a group of decorated situlae and sheet metal objects decorated with hunting scenes reported from Zalu Ab and other sites in South Kurdistan and North Luristan.9' The cuneiform inscriptions on some of the situlae indicate a date in the ninth or eighth centuries B.C. for their manufacture. On the belt in the Voss collection,9' said to be from Tepe Giyan, appears the semi-human figure with horned crown and curling sidelocks who is one of the most common motifs on the cast bronze- work from Luristan. It appears on harness rings,93 on open cast pinheads (" Wands "),94 on the tubular sockets for " standard-finials "95 and as the face of the sphinx on certain cheekpieces for horse-bits.96 This is an isolated, but by no means insignificant indication that, as accumulating evidence tends to demonstrate, the period when Luristan supported a major centre of bronze produc- tion with a distinctive repertoire of its own falls largely in the eighth and early seventh centuries B.C. It was an industry, parallel in date, as in range of artefacts, to that excavated from Cemetery " B " at Tepe Sialk.97 Even when these two major groups of decorated metal belts from Luristan have been considered there remains a third group of sheet metal belts of a much cruder kind with very simple geometric or floral decoration.@" There is no independent evidence for their date so far, but they are unlikely to differ significantly from those already discussed and may be attributed to the first three centuries of the first millennium B.C. The decorative styles of the belts and related plaques from Luristan represent the final phases of a local tradition. In the century after c. 650 B.c. the Luristan industry, working mainly in bronze, was eclipsed by another great metalworking industry, more often using gold and silver, established in and around Ecbatana as a consequence of the growing political coherence of the Medes and Persians.

The characteristics of the " Median " style in fine metalwork are still far from clear99 but they are unlikely to represent an entirely new tradition of metalworking. Historical circumstances suggest that " Median Art " was a blend of the Neo- Assyrian tradition as it appears at Ziwiyeh and the native Iranian styles found in artefacts from the same site and its near neighbours which developed naturally into the better known Achaemenian style of the late sixth and fifth centuries B.C. Belt I represents an early stage in this process : the application of Neo-Assyrian motifs to Iranian artefacts. Belt II, comparable in form but distinct in decoration, exemplifies a local Iranian decorative style which was to be completely superseded. III The use of metal belts in Achaemenian Iran is not easy to establish. In representations both of the Medes and Persians,'o0 belts appear to be of leather or fabric without metal fittings of any kind. At Persepolis and on the Oxus gold plaques'o' the Medes wear a tunic belted at the waist with a girdle from which the akinakes hangs. Although the flowing robe of the Persians often conceals the belting of their undergarments, belts when shown do not appear to be metal-plated.'?2 Belts similar to those of the Medes were worn by the Scythian tribes of South Russia. They were of leather with a strap, run through a slit cut in the belt, to take a bow case,'03 or sometimes, on the evidence of Herodotus (IV. Io), a drinking cup. Since Sarmatian dress'04 had much in common with that of the Medes and Scythians : tunic and baggy trousers, often of leather, they might be expected to have worn exactly the same type of belt. A significant change, however, is reflected in the appearance of a new form of belt fitting : the hook-clasp,105 often very elaborately made in metal. Present evidence suggests that such fittings were not part of Achaemenian or Scythian dress. Also, in at least one case,'I6 a Sarmatian is represented wearing a broad belt made of metal plaques. Despite the absence of surviving examples documentary evidence indicates that such belts may also have been worn on ceremonial occasions in Achaemenian Iran. Quintus Curtius,'o7 in describing the elaborate costume of Darius III, records that he wore a gold belt, knotted like a woman's. The Avesta, which probably covers the period from the seventh to the third centuries B.C.,'s8 also refers to gold belts.'09 Such a belt, or rather a close relation, is represented by an object recently received in the Ash- molean Museum, Oxford`" (Plates II and III). As circumstances of the belt's discovery and acquisi- tion are not known, any attempt to identify the place and date of manufacture must rest entirely on internal evidence. The belt, just over a metre long (I *05 m.), is made of fourteen rectangular silver gilt plaques mounted on a single strip of leather, now broken in a number of places, but otherwise remarkably well preserved."' Each plaque is made from a single piece of beaten silver (approximately -0o84 X ?075 m. in size) with the upper and lower edges turned over (by about -oI3 m.) to form a flange which secures the plaque to its leather backing. Each plaque has a raised margin with milled surface and the upper face of the plaque, apart from the zoomorphic devices, is decorated with a series of traced semi-circles to form an irregular overall scale pattern. Raised, rectangular strips of metal, slightly angled in the centre, are soldered on to the surface of each plaque, one above and one below 99 R. D. Barnett, Iranica Antiqua, 2, 1962, pp. 77 ff. ; W.

They are made so as to form a series of cells or cloisons for garnet inlays."2 The cloisons are rectangular in shape on the three plaques at either end of the belt, otherwise triangular, with stones cut to the appropriate shape. The flat surface of each inlay is slightly set back from the face of the cloison which serves to hold it in place. As far as it is possible to see the inlays are partly cemented into each cell. The plaques at either end of the belt are decorated with a winged bull in repousse', with the details of the rib cage, wing feathers, mouth, ear and nostril chased on the surface (Plate IIIa). An almond-shaped cloison is soldered on to the lower part of its wing to take a garnet inlay with a domed face which rises above the edge of the cloison. The animal is represented in a " flying gallop " with tail in the air, its end turned over. All the other plaques are decorated in repousse with a pair of insects, set back to back, with an opening in the plaque between the back of their wings (Plate IIIc). In the centre of each insect's back an almond-shaped cloison is soldered on to take a garnet inlay cut with a domed surface as on the winged bulls. Details of the insect's prominent eyes and abdomen are chased on the surface. The exact identity of this insect is not easy to establish."3 It is almost certainly not a cicada as similar insects are sometimes called in archaeological literature. The most likely model is a bee-particularly if it is correct to recognize a protruding sting in certain of the insects-with its large eyes and pointed abdomen carefully represented. The clasp is extremely simple (Plate IIIb). The end of the belt is turned over to form a much deeper metal flange than is usual on the upper and lower edges (approximately "023 m. wide) and two hooks, one now broken off, are fitted to it (01o2 m. apart). Each hook is made of a strand of silver, the lower end hammered out to form a thin flange of metal which is soldered"4 to the surface of the flange. The head of the hook is treated zoomorphically. Delicately chased lines suggest the head of a swan, the curve of the hook its neck. Two rivets are, driven through both plaque and flange from the front, their flat heads appearing on the surface of the belt. They do not appear to have any function in relation to the hooks, but may be to secure the flange firmly to its leather backing. Two pear-shaped holes are pierced through the corresponding end-plaque in the appropriate position to take the hooks. A single rivet passes through both plaque and flange between the two holes. The belt has only one other feature (Plate IIa &amp; d). Two holes are pierced through the second plaque from the right, one in each of the lower corners. Through each hole passes a small fragment of copper wire, presumably original; in one case coiled round to form a loop. They seem too slight to take anything except a very light weapon; but on the evidence of Herodotus already cited, they might well have served to suspend a cup. Iconography and Chronology The bulls with curved wings on the end plaques provide an important clue to identification of the belt's source and date of manufacture. They were a popular motif in the art of south-west Asia during the Achaemenian period. Though the winged bull is a creature of Assyrian origin, it was always shown in Assyria, from the Middle Assyrian period onwards, with a straight wing,"5 as were all winged creatures on objects produced in local Assyrian workshops."6 The curved wing appeared in Assyria on the ivories and bronze bowls made by Phoenician craftsmen working in the Egyptian manner, but it does not seem to have been adopted by local craftsmen."I7 Mischwesen with curved wings appear in the early first millennium B.C. on seals from Babylonia and Elam,"8 whence they were adopted and II Mr. A. W. Kingsbury of the University Museum, Oxford, kindly commented on these stones for me. "3 I am very grateful to Mr. J. P. Doncaster, Keeper of Entom- ology, British Museum (Natural History), and his staff for advice on this problem. The following comments owe much to their suggestions.

The straight wing appears on the fine metalwork of the Marlik culture120 and objects in a derivative Neo-Assyrian style from Ziwiyeh."' In the other objects reported from Ziwiyeh'22 and unprovenanced objects usually ascribed to Median workshops'23 the upper end of the wings already have a pronounced curve. The appearance of the curved wing in Achaemenian art is first documented at Persepolis ;"24 the winged " genius " erected by Cyrus at Pasargadae, perhaps under Syrian influence,'25 has two pairs of straight wings. After the late sixth century B.C. the curved wing, often with a very concave upper edge, became a hall- mark of Achaemenian art. The lack of chronologically fixed points and the apparent absence of major iconographic develop- ments in Achaemenian art over a period of two hundred years does not allow for precision in dating specific examples of a common motif. However, certain factors, apart from the garnet inlay, make clear that this particular treatment of the winged bull in a " flying gallop " belongs to the final phase of Achaemenian art in the fourth century B.C. Unfortunately the winged bull only appears on the sculptured friezes at Persepolis126 as the handle of a spouted amphora carried by one of the tribute bearers (Plate IVa), who was identified both by Schmidt and Herzfeld"7 as a Syrian ; Barnett2"8 has argued that he is in fact a Lydian. Whatever the exact area of origin, his delegation certainly comes from the west of the Empire and brings as tribute vessels and bracelets now considered characteristic of Achaemenian workmanship. The only handle of this kind known to me'29 is reported to come from Mesopotamia, where it was found with a hoard of coins dating from the fifth and early fourth centuries B.C. Amandry'30 has discussed it at length and proposed a date in the first half of the fifth century for its manufacture. The hatched " beard " along the jaw and the chasing of the wings is well paralleled at Persepolis. Very much more detailed representations of winged bulls appeared on the gold overlay from one of the doors in the Apadana Palace at Persepolis'31 (Plate IVb). Both context and style suggest that they belong to the earlier phases of Achaemenian art, before about 470 B.C. The distinctive margins and panels of curled hair on the body and legs of the bulls are a legacy from Urartian even more perhaps than from Assyrian art.'32 With these bulls may be associated a similar one on an unproven- anced silver bowl 33 (Plate IVc). A virtual absence of such panels of hair and greater emphasis on musculation of the body in stylized geometric forms is more characteristic of developed Achaemenian art. Such devices are conventionally referred to as the " bow-and-dot " motif on the haunches'34 and the " pear-and-apple " motif on the shoulders.'35 In a rudimentary form they may first be seen on the reliefs at Persepolis on the ordinary bulls shown passant on the canopy of Darius, in reality probably gold appliques rather than embroidery.'36 A virtually identical treatment of the bull, this time winged, appears on a " goldsmith's " trial piece from Egypt'37 (Plate IVd). Though their tails flutter in the air, all these bulls are represented in the formal passant position, each leg shown, one behind the other. This is in marked contrast to the " gallop " of the bulls on the two belt plaques. During the period of Achaemenian supremacy in the Near East representations of animals running at full speed, in the same posture as the bulls on the belt, were a particularly common subject on the so-called " Graeco-Persian " gems.'38 The developed naturalistic style of these seal stones is closely 19 A.

Significantly it is in this very hoard that the closest parallel to the winged bulls on this belt may be found. Among the rich variety of objects reported with this hoard was a metal plaque,'40 said to be of gold, exactly like the belt plaques in form, but not inlaid. On it, in repouss6, is represented a winged bull in every detail like those on the belt under discussion (Plate IVe). Its date, as with all pieces in this hoard, can only be established on external evidence.'4' Some indication is provided by a pair of very similar belt plaques, in silver, from the second kurgan at Pazyryk'42 decorated in repousse with an animal combat: between lion and ibex. The over- lapping animals and their muscular stylization is as typical of Achaemenian art as is the motif. The distinctive treatment of the ibex horns and its " bow-and-dot " body markings appear on a magnificent ibex vessel handle included in the Oxus hoard.'43 These two plaques are objects of definite Achaemenian inspiration, if not actually of Iranian manufacture. The relative chronology of the five large kurgans at Pazyryk, extending over approximately fifty years, has been established on the basis of tree-ring counts-kurgans I and 2 are the oldest;'44 but the question of their absolute chronology is more complex. Rudenko has argued for a date in the fifth century B.C.'45 but Griaznov'46 argued for a fourth to third century date and Kiselev'47 has suggested something even lower. Azarpay,'48 after a detailed examination of the Greek and Near Eastern motifs in the art of Pazyryk, gave the beginning of the fourth century B.C. as the terminus post quem for all the Pazyryk burials. This argument is supported by the conventional date for a broken Chinese mirror found in the sixth kurgan; a type ascribed by Karlgren to the fourth century B.C.'49 It also agrees with the generally accepted view that the definite Achaemenian imports at Pazyryk must have reached the area before c. 330 B.C. when Alexander's conflicts with the central Asiatic tribes terminated trade between the Oxus region and Iran. Owing to a fairly wide margin of error, recent Carbon 14 deter- minations do not add significantly to the discussion, though happily they confirm the main chrono- logical limits set by conventional archaeological arguments. A beam from the covering of kurgan II yielded a date of 2350 ? 140 B.P. (1963) ; part of the covering of kurgan V gave a date of 2440 - 50 B.P. (1963)."5o The Pazyryk belt plaques may then be ascribed to the early fourth century B.c., which will also be taken here as the terminus post quem for the winged bull motif used on the belt under discussion. The closest parallel to the swan hook on this belt is to be found on a gold object, perhaps a perfume bottle, now in the Hermitage, Leningrad, as part of Peter the Great's collection of Siberian goldwork.'5' It is made in the shape of a falcon standing on a swan or goose, whose body is represented by an open- work oval with the neck and head cast solid in exactly the form found on the belt hook.: Scale-shaped cloisons cover the falcon's neck and chest, larger cells are set on its wings and tail, two rectangular cells on its thighs. On the grounds of its technical similarity to the polychrome jewellery in the Oxus hoard Salmony dated this object to the fifth or fourth centuries B.c. and attributed it to the first phase of Sarmatian art.'52 Similar bird terminals were very popular on spoons and ladles'53 and on bracelets'54 in the Achaemenian Empire.

Indeed Zeuner has suggested'55 that many of Mrs. van Buren's identifications of flies in Mesopotamian art should be regarded as representations of bees.'56 In view of the inherent difficulties I will merely cite a number of formal parallels from Iran and the Asiatic periphery of the Achaemenian Empire, where bees were common.'s7 I do not know an example of this or related insects on metalwork of the Achaemenian period in Iran, though they occur earlier in Western Iran on a dirk'1s and a fragment of bronze,'59 both without secure provenance. The bee appears as a bead in Greek jewellery from South Russia'60 and was a very popular motif in Greece itself,'6' but until the arrival of the Sarmatians in the steppe region of South Russia neither flies, bees nor cicadas were a common decorative motif. Kithn'6' in fact ascribed the introduction of the " cicada " motif to the Sarmatians, who probably derived it from further east, where it appears early and persistently in Chinese art.163 The lineal descendants of the insects on this belt may thus be found among the " cicada " fibulae of the early first millennium A.D. Indeed examples from Kertch of the fourth century A.D. closely resemble them in form.'64 The motif was diffused across Europe into Merovingian France where bees or cicadas were sewn on to the purple shroud or placed in the coffin of Childeric I (died A.D. 482) at Tournai.'65 Technique and Chronology Close identity in the form of the two winged bulls and between the twelve winged insects indicate that the maker of the belt worked with a set of patterns, one for each bull and one for the bees. As the belt seems to have been worked mainly from the front it would appear to have been hammered over a pair of low relief cores, of stone or bronze.'66 Such a method would greatly facilitate the production of an object like this, in which a number of identical patterns were constantly repeated. Although the cores have usually not survived there is evidence that in the sixth century B.c. both Greek and Scythian jewellery was made in South Russia by hammering the sheet metal over a wooden core with punches of horn or bone.'67 Cores in bronze have survived in a Ptolemaic jeweller's hoard from GaljiAb in the Egyptian Delta'68 and a magnificent Scythian example is reported from Garchinovo in Bulgaria.'69 At present most of the evidence for the technology of fine metal work in the Achaemenian period comes from Egypt during the Persian occupation. Frankfort'70 identified a small-scale stone relief from Egypt of the Achaemenian period as a goldsmith's trial piece. It is known from the finds at Galjfib that Ptolemaic goldsmiths often worked in close collaboration with sculptors. In his excavations at Memphis Petrie found some small lead "trays ", which he suggested " were made for the silversmiths to carry with them, both for taking orders and for scaling out their work ".7"' One of these is definitely of the Achaemenian period,'72 the other is more likely to be Ptolemaic.'73 Also from Memphis in the Ptolemaic period come stone models of helmets and shields74 which almost certainly served as gold- smiths' models in a manner recently explained by Mis. Davidson.'75 In an important series of reliefs from the fourth century tomb of Pedusiri at Tfina the production of zoomorphic rhyta is shown in '55 A History of Domesticated Animals, 1963, p. 498. 156 The Fauna of Ancient Mesopotamia, 1938, pp. I o8 ff.

As far as it is now possible to judge, for much of it has worn off, the surface of each plaque in this belt was completely fire-gilded. In the Achaemenian period such gilding is more often used to pick out specific details in the design,'77 than as the overall treatment of an object's surface. In fire-gilding an amalgam of mercury and powdered gold is spread over the surface of the silver, which is then heated to vaporize the mercury, leaving the gold behind in contact with the silver. The early history of this process is still very obscure. Mercury was known to the Assyrians, but, as far as textual evidence goes, only for medicinal purposes and perhaps to colour small figures.1'7 Cinnabar, native mercury sulphide, was available both to the Assyrians and the Persians near Kirkuk in Iraq,'79 at a number of places in Persia'8s and perhaps also from Anatolia.'8s As far as I am aware no artefacts, fire-gilded rather than gilded by applying gold leaf to a base, with or without an adhesive, have been reported from the Near East before the Achaemenian period. In Egypt fire-gilding does not appear before the fifth century B.c. at the earliest,'8' and may well have been introduced into the country by Persian metalsmiths. In Greece's3 mercury is first mentioned by writers of the fourth century B.c. Theophrastus is the first to describe its preparation from cinnabar by treatment with vinegar and mentions that it has some practical uses, though he does not describe them. It was Vitruvius, in the first century B.C., who first recorded that " neither silver nor gold can be properly gilded without it (mercury) ",'84 and there are no unequivocal examples of fire-gilding in the Graeco-Roman world before the Roman period.'85 In discussing the belt's iconography it became clear that it was unlikely to be the product of a workshop under direct Achaemenian influence; the bees and the swan hook suggest the Asiatic periphery of their Empire. Examination of the belt's cloisonne decoration endorses this conclusion and defines more clearly the time and place of manufacture. Knowledge of Achaemenian polychrome jewellery is still restricted. Few of the surviving examples are from good archaeological contexts, and it is difficult to date within less than fifty years those that are. Moreover, even where sockets or cloisons remain, the actual inlay has more often than not disappeared. Yet there may be no doubt of its popu- larity at the time. The Achaemenian love of colour and inlay was not confined to jewellery; it extended to all the arts. Herodotus'86 records that the seven circuits of the city wall of Ecbatana had battlements, each a different colour. Sculptures at Pasargadae and Persepolis were originally painted in blue, scarlet, green, purple and yellow ; details were covered with gold foil and sometimes inlaid.'87 At Susa the glazed brick friezes reflect the same fashion and also reveal the richness of colour used in the textiles and fabrics for which the area had long been famous,'88 only known otherwise from the textiles of Iranian inspiration, if not actually of Iranian manufacture, found at Pazyryk. Cups inlaid with precious stones are mentioned by Parmenion in his list of booty taken from the Persians in the time of Alexander. 89 The history of inlaid and cloisonng jewellery in Persia is slowly becoming apparent. It appears in Sialk IV and some time later at Susa,'90 probably under Sumerian influence.'9' If Tukris'is to be located in Western Persia, the late Bronze Age inventories from Qatna suggest'9' an intimate association between this area and a particular type of inlaid jewellery. By the early first millennium it was being I76 G. Lefebvre, Le Tombeau de Petosiris, Paris, 1924, III, pl. VII- VIII. '77E. L. B. Terrace, Antike Kunst, VI, 1963, PP. 72-3, lists examples. 178 R. C.

The technique was probably commoner in Syria and Assyria than the scanty existing evidence allows. The range of inlaid ivories, first revealed in nineteenth-century excavations94 has been greatly increased by Mallowan's work at Nimrud.'95 Many were gilded and inlaid with red and green frits, glass and lapis lazuli. Cloisonne work was used by the jewellers of Tell Halaf'96 and a cloisonni breast plate is worn by the amber statuette of an Assyrian king, now in Boston.197 It may be that the Scythians adopted the fashion after their contacts with the Medes in north Persia, for it appears, if rarely, amongst the earliest examples of fine metalwork ascribed to the Scythians in South Russia. Simple cells of triangular or rectangular shape were used on objects from Kelermes'98 and a horse's head from the U1 barrow'99 in the late seventh to sixth century B.c. The almond-shaped cloison also appears for the first time in this period on a cast bronze lion from the " Golden barrow " near Simferopol.o00 The form probably has an Iranian origin, for this shape is cut for inlay on the lion handles of a gold vessel, now in the Kevorkian Collec- tion20' which may be ascribed to the Median period, c. late seventh to sixth century B.C. As far as present evidence goes it seems that blue stones - lazulites and turquoises - alone or combined with yellow ones, were preferred by Achaemenian and earlier workshops in Western Asia.'o2 The appearance of red stones, garnets or zircons, was a fashion introduced from the Asiatic periphery of the Achaemenian Empire by the Parthians who had inherited it from their predecessors in that area. Garnets came from India and Ceylon along a trade route which ran through Bactria, down the Oxus to the Caspian. Other sources existed in Siberia. It is the use of garnets and their placing on this belt which most convincingly associate it with this area in the very late or immediately post-Achaemenian period. It is a characteristic of Achaemenian polychrome jewellery that the inlay or cloisons are placed to emphasize the stylized musculation of animals or monsters. By contrast the inlay on the Siberian gold- work203 is often lavish and indiscriminate, in many instances concealing rather than accentuating the organic structure of the creature to which it is applied. The garnet inlays on this belt have nothing to do with the anatomy of the animals or insects to which they are fixed, but they are applied with restraint. At Pazyryk almond-shaped inlays in felt were used on the neck of an elk and on the mane and ribs of a griffin, usually without any direct relevance to anatomical forms.204 This use of inlay and cloisonne work for pure ornament seems to be a distinctive trait of Asiatic " nomad " art. It is generally agreed that the great development of polychrome decoration from the fourth century B.C. onwards in the artistic tradition conventionally attributed to the Sarmatians was stimulated by close contact with the jewellery of Achaemenian Persia.205 Speiser'26 argued that the well-known pair of polychrome bracelets in the Oxus hoard,'07 from the final phase of Achaemenian art,'"o provide the crucial link between it and " Sarmatian " art. To this transitional phase I would also attribute this belt. In almost every respect, technically and iconographically, it belongs to a new artistic tradition, but the winged bull is so characteristically Achaemenian and so like the one on the gold plaque from the Oxus hoard, that it seems unlikely that this belt was manufactured more than fifty years after the end of the Achaemenian Empire. Such distinctively Achaemenian motifs are not found in developed " Sarmatian " art. Indeed it could have been made in the half century before c. 330 B.C., but this seems less likely. It is far more difficult to say whether it was made in a workshop west or east of the Caspian. 193 Hasanlu-E. Porada, Ancient Iran, 1965, fig. p. 119 ; Ziwiyeh A.

This belt is clearly a luxury object for ceremonial rather than routine use, for a man rather than a woman. Although it is known that various awards for valour and service were made in the ancient Near East they do not appear to have included belts. But since daggers are the most common award it may perhaps be assumed that such a gift included a belt or baldric. Though the Egyptians usually awarded gold flies as military decorations,209 daggers, sometimes bearing the name of the royal donor, were also presented.210 In Assyria Sennacherib rewarded the builders of his canal with gold daggers and rings21' and Ashurbanipal, in his own words : " wrote my name (phonetically) upon an iron dagger (to be worn in) the girdle the mounting of which was golden, and gave it to him (Necho)."212 Kings of the second Isin Dynasty, and more rarely their officers, presented daggers to mercenaries from Western Persia for acts of valour.2,3 Among the peoples who migrated from central Asia into Europe across the steppe the warrior's belt alone was a reward for valour. All the available evidence is considerably later than the belt under discussion, but the general idea may have been current much earlier.214 Among the Avars and the Franks the power of a defeated foe passed to his conqueror with his belt and later among the Mongols alliances were concluded by the exchange of belts captured from enemies. It is possible, by analogy with Avar practice, that this belt is the second of two belonging to a warrior. The first, of simpler form, would have carried his arms, the second, more elaborately decorated with totemic emblems-perhaps the bees-his cup.225 APPENDIX REPORT ON THE LEATHER By M. L. RYDER The thickness of the specimen, combined with the coarseness of the collagen fibres seen in sections, suggests that the material is ox-hide, but no hair remains that would confirm such an identification (cf. Ryder, 1964)216 were found in any of the sections cut from two separate fragments. The specimens were appreciably degraded, and so there is no reason to suppose that it is not the original mounting. An overall maroon staining reaction was obtained with the method of Ryder (I 963),217 which suggests vegetable tanning, but it is possible that a similar reaction could have been brought about by long exposure to the earth through burial. It is of interest to record that the sections had an outer zone with a pale brown colour, which had presumably arisen by the removal of the basophilic (maroon staining) elements, possibly by the alkali in the softening fluid used prior to sectioning.
