"The Responsible Center: Man and Nature in Pueblo and Navaho Ritual Songs and Prayers," A£, 30 (Spring 1978), 90-107. Selected Indian materials are subjected to "ethnopoetic analy- sis" to demonstrate the thesis that in them "man is seen as a creative factor in the eternal circle of the cosmos and as a source of value." [DKR] 5420 Buechner, Frederick. Telling the Truth: The Gospel as Tragedy , Comedy , and Fairy Tale. New York: Harper and Row, 1977. 97 pp. $5.95. Buechner considers the gospel as tragedy, comedy, and fairy tale. His observations about King Lear in the section of tragedy should Bibliography / õõ</page><page sequence="4">make the book valuable for literary scholars by their sheer originality and insight in making comparisons between this tragedy and the gospel. Buechner moves easily and always intelligently through a host of other works that shed light on the Jesus story, including L.F . Baum1 s The Wizard of Oz, J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, and C.S. Lewis1 s "The Chronicles of Nar nia" series. 5421 Lebowitz, Martin. "Literature and Myth," YR, 63 (Dec. 1973), 308-12 (rev. -art. , John B. Vickery, "The Literary Impact of The Golden Bough , " Princeton University, 1973; Eric Smith, "Some Versions of the Fall: The Myth of the Fall of Man in English Literature," University of Pittsburgh, 1973) . Vickery treats the role of mythology in the writing of Yeats, T.S. Eliot, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and briefly in the works of minor poets and novelists. He implies that the design of Frazer's The Golden Bough influences the writers' con- cept of formal coherence. Smith places his major emphasis on Milton's Paradise Lost as an Augustinián and Puritan personal myth concerning the necessity of obedience and love. He makes distinctions between the story-pattern itself and the personal myths of literature based upon it. 5422 McLean, Campbell. "The Kirk and the Arts," TW, 2, No. 12 (15 June 1978), 6. Takes issue with Maurice Lindsay's recent History of Scottish Literature in which Lindsay resurrects the chestnut "that the withering of the arts in Scotland may be chiefly attributed to the Kirk, and more especially to its long black shadow, Calvinism." Sug- gests that the factors responsible are Scotland's poverty, the emphasis of Scottish education, "which has favoured the three Rs . . . rather than the arts," the "naturalistic and paradoxical traditions" of Scot- tish literature, and "the kind of Puritanism which filtered into Scot- land in the seventeenth century . " Claims that the arts and the Kirk "have never been close enough . . . for a complementary perspective to evolve" and looks forward to "an improvement in the quality of the dialogue between the church and the artist." [PSG] 5423 Needham, Joseph. "Love Sacred and Profane," Theology, 80 (1977): 16-22. That the experiences of human love and divine love are closely related is attested to by mystics and poets of many cultures. [Auden, Day Lewis, and Greene are among those quoted.] [CAH] 5424 Prickett, Stephen. "What Do the Translators Think They Are Up To?", Theology , 80 (1977) , 403-10. The language of the Authorized Ver- sion remains superior to that of modern versions not because it is more pleasing aesthetically but because "it is much more subtle theologically" - less inclined than the language of this scientific era to suggest that everything has a natural explanation, and hence better able to preserve the mystery and the ambiguity of the original. (The same tendency toward thinning out theological statement by settling on just one of the possible meanings may be seen in C.S. Lewis's The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe . ) [CAH] 5425 Schmerling, Hilda L. Finger of God : Religious Thought and Themes in Literature from Chaucer to Kafka. Religion in Literature Series. Bibliography / 67</page><page sequence="5">New York; Gordon Press, 1977. 135 pp. $39.95. This book contains unconnected essays on a wide range of subjects, mostly medieval and Renaissance, a few modern: Chaucer (spring motif and its ancestry); Shakespeare (Shylock and his ancestry) ; Fulwell (Like Will to Like, a sixteenth-century interlude) ; Marlowe (Jew of Malta) ; George Herbert ("Peace"); Dickens (Pickwick Papers) ; Kafka; and twentieth-century Jewish- American authors. 5426 Seelye, John. "Some Green Thoughts on a Green Theme," TriQ, 23/24 (Winter- Spring 1972), 576-638. The idea of garden as happy interval before the fall is not only universal, sacramental, and political, but also literary. Elements of conservative Virgilian and revolutionary Christian pastoralism run through literature in English from Chaucer to Thoreau, particularly in the development of the novel. Thoreau emerges as the champion of Christian revolution. ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL 5427 Ashley, Kathleen M. "Divine Power in Chester Cycle and Late Medieval Thought," JHI, 39 (July-Sept. 1978), 387-404. Dialogue, characterization, and structure are combined in the Chester cycle to celebrate the omnipotence of God. Though no specific vernacular source for the theme can be cited, "we can at least show that the cycle re- flects a larger philosophical emphasis of its time. ..." [OKR] 5428 Foster, Kenelm. The Two Dantes and Other Studies . Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1978. 260 pp. $16.00. The conceptual thread that holds the entire collection together is Foster's plan to relate Dante's humanistic system with the tradition- al tenets of Christianity, as expounded particularly by St. Thomas Aquinas. The wide range of reading that the author draws from (pagan and/or Church fathers) makes this book very interesting for Dante scholars but quite challenging for the general reader who might be moved to explore further the various interpretations offered here. 5429 Hill, Thomas D. "The ' fyrst ferhdbana' : Old English Exodus , 399," N&amp;Q, 21, No. 6 (June 1974), 204-5. The "First Soulkiller" in this passage is not Cain, as proposed by Francis A. Blackburn, or the devil, as suggested by E.B. Irving, but Adam. Christian exegetical tradition has consistently regarded Adam as causing the death of all man's souls until Christ the Redeemer came; the context fits this interpretation well in that it deals with the thwarted sacrifice of Isaac, a ram re- placing him just as, later, Christ replaced Adam as a sacrifice. More- over, this interpretation accords well with what we know of the Exodus poet's preoccupation with Old Testament types and with packing his lines with meaning. 5430 Hollander, Robert. Boccaccio' s Two Venuses . New York: Columbia University Press, 1977. 246 pp. $17.50. Hollander argues per- suasively that Boccaccio's minor works in Italian possess a definite Christian moral framework that allows them to be read and interpreted in a consistent and unified manner - not as paeans to pagan sensuality or "naturalism," but rather as guides to, or treatises on, the proper kind of love and Christian morality in its earthly dimension. There Bibliography / 68</page><page sequence="6">is then no basis to the traditional distinction made between Boccaccio's so-called early "pagan" works and his later "Christian" ones; all are ordered according to a single perspective that is the elucidation of the two conflicting conceptions of Venus (carnal and celestial) and their effects (destructive and salutary) on mankind. 5431 Hoy, James F. "On the Relationship of the Corpus Christi Plays to the Corpus Christi Procession at York," MP, 71 (Nov. 1973), 166-69. Parts of the York civic records show that the routes followed by the Corpus Christi plays and the Corpus Christi processions were different from their beginnings. Thus the plays could not have evolved from the processions. 5432 Jentoft, C.W. "Henryson as Authentic 'Chaucerian' : Narrator, Character, and Courtly Love in The Testament of Cresseid, " SSL, 10 (Oct. 1972), 94-102. The most convincing argument for the belief that The Testament sustains the Chaucerian spirit lies in the role of courtly love. In both his and Chaucer's works, Criseyde's sin is courtly, not Christian. 5433 Kahrl, Stanley J. "Medieval Drama in England, 1973: Chester and Ely," ROR D, 15-16 (1972-73), 117-23. Productions of medieval drama in England during the summer of 1973 included those at York, Chester, and Ely. The production at York was rather stiff and lifeless. The Chester production was quite original but rather disappointing. It was heavily influenced by the theatrical movement of which Godspell is a part and was not really a production of a medieval cycle, but rather a modern interpretation of the biblical episodes treated in medieval cycle plays. The Ely production was a series of more tradi- tionally staged plays performed inside Ely cathedral by separate commun- ity theater groups. The Old Testament plays were paced too slowly, but the Play of the Crucifixion was superb. 5434 Keenan, Hugh T. "Satan Speaks in Sparks: Christ and Satan, 78-79a, 161b-162b, and The Life of St. Antony , " N&amp;Q, 21 (August 1974) , 283-4. For his image of Satan speaking in sparks and flame, the anonymous OE poet may have drawn upon the Life of St. Antony , per- haps in the popular Latin rendering of the Greek original. Possibly also this Life suggested both the picture of Satan as a ranter, boast- ing deceitfully, and his punishment of measuring hell with his hands. 5435 Munson, William F. "Holiday, Audience Participation, and Charac- terization in the Shepherd's Plays," RORD, 15-16 (1972-73), 97-115. Corpus Christi was a time for the celebration of community and group solidarity. Individual citizens participated in processions as repre- sentatives of their guilds as well as of the wider community of mankind. In the Shepherd's play citizens acting as shepherds represented their &gt; town and mankind as a whole in the creation of a ceremonial reality which united actors and audience in a moment of holiday rejoicing. 5436 O'Loughlin, Michael. The Garlands of Repose : The Literary Cele- bration of Civic and Retired Leisure: The Traditions of Homer and Vergil, Horace and Montaigne . Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978. 326 pp. $23.00. "This book is about the literary Bibliography / 69</page><page sequence="7">celebration of ' free 1 time within time as it was variously apprehended in two perennial kinds of imaginative structure." After some etymo- logical musings and a quick brush with Aristotle, Huizinga, Veblen, Marcuse, Josef Pieper, and others, we are plunged into the Phaeacian interlude of the Odyssey. From the gardens of Alcinous, we are, pre- dictably, ushered into the refined atmosphere of Theocritus' s Idylls and Virgil's Eclogues. With the intermediacy of Horace, the discussion passes to the Christian dispensation and some rather fanciful harmoni- zations of the Sermon on the Mount and Juan de la Cruz 1 s Dark Night of the Soul with ancient pastoral themes. A rather obscure text from Erasmus's Colloquies, entitled Convivium Religiosum, " becomes the un- likely setting for the "new polis of Christian humanism." 5437 Pearcy, Roy J. "Chaucer's Franklin and Literary Vavasour," ChauR, 8 (Summer 1973) , 33-59. As the term "vavasor" lost social significance with the decay of traditional feudal structures, it gained literary significance with the emergence of new genres, wherein vavasors consistently represent certain realities of late medieval social life, and relate thematically with knights-errant functioning as representatives of Christian chivalric ideals. 5438 Thompson, Leonard L. Introducing Biblical Literature : A More Fantastic Country. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1978. 350 pp. $12.95. Thompson's new approach to biblical literature emphasizes the language of the Bible and its symbolic character. He covers on a grand scale what others have attempted in more piecemeal fashion. In summary, he writes, "dynamics in the world of the Bible are controlled by the divine/human dialogue. The dynamics within that dialogue are threefold: the cosmogonie and covenantal mythological traditions through which the Lord God appears; the of f-center/at-center perspectives from which man relates to the dialogue; and the conditional/ unconditional elements of the dialogue itself." The study is structured in five parts: (1) Syntax of the Bible: creation through language; (2) Dynamics: time, space, and movement in the Old Testament; (3) Vox Dei: sayings in the Old Testament; (4) Christian modulations: the New Testament; and (5) Unity of the Bible: myth, image, and metaphor. 5439 Wawn, Arthur N. "Chaucer, 'The Plowman's Tale' and Reformation Propaganda: The Testimonies of Thomas Godfray and I Playne Piers," BJRL, 56 (Autumn 1973), 174-92. Two apocryphal tales have been attribu- ted to Chaucer's Plowman. The first is actually a poem by Thomas Hoccleve ("Miracle of the Virgin") . A spurious "Prologe of the Ploughman" was added to it, and it was thus "grafted on to the frame work of the Canterbury Tales in the Christ Church manuscript. The second "Plowman's Tale," first printed about 1536 by Thomas Godfray, was published for an official propaganda purpose. This abrasive Lollard poem was published at a time when the official Henrician propagandist organization was active, by those anxious to attack abuses within the church and to em- phasize the historical continuity of Henry VIII 's cause. It is now possible to show that the unknown author of "I Playne Piers Which Cannot Flatter" knew the poem in its original state (before the prologue was added) and that the king's officials added a 52-line prologue, which converts an anonymous fifteenth-century Lollard poem into a "Canterbury Tale," and interpolated lines 205-28 in which the pope is directly Bibliography /70</page><page sequence="8">criticized. These chancres shift the ideolocry of the poem toward Henrician propaganda. SIXTEENTH CENTURY 5440 Connell, Dorothy. Sir Philip Sidney ; The Maker ' s Mind. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978. 163 pp. $14.95. Not so broad in scope as the subtitle suggests, this study explores several distinct topics related to Sidney's style, critical theory, and re- vision of Arcadia in order to develop a thesis about a consistent "habit of mind" which is both individual to Sidney and characteristic of the best of Renaissance perceptions of life and art. This central concept reconciles what the author interprets as disparate critical views of Sidney as a "modern" perceiver of ambivalences and as a tra- ditional Christian moralist. The concept similarly integrates the religious with the secular, humanist writings and the prose of the Arcadias with Sidney's poetic style and theory. 5441 Davis, Walter R. "Arthur, Partial Exegesis, and the Reader," TSLL, 18 (Winter 1977), 553-76. Spenser's The Faerie Queene can be read from the perspective of the fourfold method of scriptural exe- gesis. the literal, the allegorical, the tropological , and the ana- gogical. Book I of The Faerie Queene operates on all four levels. Therefore, a certain scene can simultaneously carry one meaning literal- ly and a different one allegorically . [LAP] 5442 Hardison, O.B., Jr. "Amoretti and the Dolce Stil Nuovo," ELR, 2, No. 2 (Spring 1972) , 208-16. The various sonnets follow the church calendar , and in the sequence , the poet ' s search for a deeper understanding of human love is placed against the background of divine love. 5443 Hill, W. Speed. "Doctrine and Polity in Hooker's 'Laws,'" ELR, 2, No. 2 (Spring 1972), 173-93. Consideration of Hooker's "Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Politie in the Light of the Non-polity Writings" shows that they are an extensive application of principles Hooker outlines in other works. The clarification of ideas, such as that of man as a free individual able to choose between good and evil and encouraged by a rational Creator to think for himself, was the prin- cipal aim behind all of Hooker's writings. 5444 Huffman, Clifford Chalmers. "Titus Andronicus: Metamorphosis and Renewal," MLR, 67 (Oct. 1972), 730-41. The first part of Titus concerns the tyranny that envelops Rome; the second, Rome's escape from tyranny and its purification and renewal. In a manner compatible with early Christian views of Rome's role in the history of civilization, the exile and subsequent return of Lucius represents the city's fall from justice and its later internal healing - the establishment of a "fifth kingdom under Christ." 5445 McAuley, James. "The Form of Una's Marriage Ceremony in The Faerie Queene , " N&amp;Q, 21 (Nov. 1974), 410-11. In inventing a marriage rite for Una and the Redcrcss Knight (Book I) different from both Christian and classical ritual, Spenser was drawing upon something Bibliography / 71</page><page sequence="9">antecedent to both - the Garden of Eden story. His symbolic point was that protestantism represented true religion, traceable to Adam, who received it from God himself. "The Elizabethan religious establish- ment" was thus confirmed as authentic. 5446 Wilson, John. "Calvin and the Arts," TW, 2, No. 2 (15 June 1978), 3-5. The view that "Calvin, intellectual and austere, [was] the bitter foe of all art, pleasure and aesthetic delight . . . bears little relation to reality. He not only had a high regard and an important place for the arts in his thinking, but encouraged his people to appre- ciate (and enjoy) . . . 'one of the richest gifts of God to mankind.1" [PSG] SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 5447 Anselment, Raymond A. "'The Church Militant': George Herbert and the Metamorphoses of Christian History," HLQ (August 1978), 299-316. In this poem Herbert employs prophetic irony to reveal the movements of providence in the shifting patterns of history, specifi- cally the movement of the Church from East to West. Herbert sees pro- vidence as, above all, proof of God's triumphant love: "Not the decrees of power but bands of love." [ETE] 5448 Danson , Lawrence . The Harmonies of "The Merchant of Venice . " New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1978. 202 pp. $15.00. Danson, with an impressive historical survey of relevant ideas common to the Elizabethan period, takes up all the troublesome problems of the play: Shy lock' s and Portia's controversial characters; Antonio's melancholy; and the Christian community's mercy and justice. At the same time, he covers adequately, if briefly, the drama's stage history, as well as the main lines of critical interpretation. With sensitive insight, Danson also investigates poetic meaning and dis- continues allegorical implication, revealing a more subtle play than most critics have been aware of to date. The Merchant of Venice, in Danson' s view, should be seen as a "play written by a Christian for a Christian audience." Moreover, its conflicts - Venice versus Belmont, justice versus mercy, Jew versus Christian, for example - are not matters of defeat or victory, but of "completion or fulfillment." 5449 Fresch, Cheryl H. "Milton's Eve and the Problem of the Additions to the Command," MiltonQ, 12, No. 3 (Oct. 1978), 83-90. In Para- dise Lost Milton presents Eve's alteration of God's command concerning the forbidden fruit as an indication of her human susceptibility to the Serpent's suggestions, not as her rational (and thus sinful) approval of them. By blocking the usual theological condemnations of the bibli- cal Eve's misquoting, Milton provides a more successful blend of inno- cence and psychological naturalism for Eve's characterization. [JWF] 5450 Geckle, George L. "Poetic Justice and Measure for Measure," Costerus , 1 (1974) , 95-111. In the eighteenth century, discussion of this play was heavily influenced by the critical preconceptions of the age. The prevailing Christian interpretations of the play in the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries are equally based on critical and social preconceptions. Bibliography / 72</page><page sequence="10">5451 Harman, Barbara L. "The Fiction of Coherence; George Herbert's 'The Collar, 1 " PMIA, 93 (Oct. 1978), 865-877. Because present- tense speech is isolated from a retrospective narrative voice, thus jarring the relationship between storyteller and story, "The Collar" becomes the occasion for studying the motives for and virtues of story- telling and prompts questions as well about the values attached to narratives. [TTD] 5452 Holtgen, Karl Josef. "Donne at Aix-La-Chapelle, " Anglia, 91, No. 4 (1973), 485-86. In one of his Lincoln' s-Inn sermons, Donne recalls his stay in Aix-La-Chapelle in a curious house filled with mutually hostile Anabaptists. The date of this visit has been variously proposed as 1612 or 1619. Since Spinola drove the Protest- ants from the city in 1614, the visit occurred at the earlier date. 5453 Johnson, Clifford. "A Biblical Source for Bunyan's 'Wild Field Full of Dark Mountains,'" N&amp;Q, 21 (Nov. 1974), 413-14. This topographical oddity may represent an echo of Jeremiah 13:15-16, which Bunyan misunderstood, having in mind slight elevations over which one might stumble and fall in darkness rather than the actual mountainous terrain of the biblical text. Other biblical echoes are of 13:16 ("Shadow of death"), Psalm 27:2 ("Stumbled and fell"), and Isaiah 52:7 ("upon the mountains") . 5454 Jones, Phyllis M. , and Nicholas R. Jones, eds. Salvation in New England: Selections from the Sermons of the First Preachers . Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1977. 198 pp. $12.95. Sal- vation in New England offers nine selections from sermons and sermon series by preachers before 1670: Bulkely, Cotton, Shepard, Hooker, and Davenport. The sequence of these sermons, however, follows the conventional steps in salvation. Several are particularly concerned with thè Antinomian controversy. The editors review the role, style, and content of Puritan preaching. We are given the setting of each sermon and also notes on the text. There are brief biographies of the preachers, a checklist of the earliest authoritative editions, a suggest ed list of background readings, and ten illustrations. 5455 King, Bruce. "A Reading of Marvell's 'The Coronet,'" MLR, 68 (Oct. 1973), 741-9. This meditation on the crown of thorns re- flects the Augustinián tradition, with its initial contemplation of the sensory world followed by the dedication of man's powers to God. The poem moves from pride to humility, from an elaborate coronet of flowers to the austere crown of thorns, from a literal to a symbolic meaning, using biblical allusions, Christian symbols, and an involuted rhetoric in an argumentative structure that recalls Donne but is typically Mar- vellian. A close reading shows that as the imagery moves from brilliant to commonplace, the religious associations move in a contrary direction, becoming "richer and more profound" as the speaker becomes aware of the "distance between worldly and heavenly glory." 5456 Legouis, Pierre. "Marvell and Julian," N&amp;Q, 21 (March 1974), 102-3. In expanding a passage from Julian The Apostate to satirize Archbishop Parker in "Rehearsal Transpos 'd," Marvell correctly trans- lated the printed Greek text at one point as "son" (of Constantine) , Bibliography /73</page><page sequence="11">not knowing that the 1583 edition of the text he was using had mis- interpreted the abbreviated word, which actually stood for "Jesus," Marvellr then, unwittingly has Jesus satirizing use of the Sacraments and penitence. 5457 Nelson, Alfred L. , and Robert Brainard Pearsall. "Milton Invents a Matron," AN&amp;Q, 11 (Oct. 1972), 20-2. In Book I of the 1667 edition of Paradise Lost lines 503-5 read: "Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night / In Gibeah when hospitable dores / Yielded their matrons to prevent worse rape." In the second edition (1674) Milton changed "dores," "yielded," and "prevent" to "door," "expos' d," and "avoid," but changed "matrons" only to "matron." Milton may have been trying to reconcile his account with that in Judges 19 and to allow for differences between this account and that in Genesis 19. The word "matron ," however , appears in neither biblical account. Milton, never a narrow literalist, chose "matron" on "principles of ethics as en- shrouded in dramatic necessity." 5458 Pearse, Nancy Cotton, "Elizabeth Cary, Renaissance Playwright," TSLL, 18 (Winter 1977), 601-8. In about 1602, Elizabeth Cary, at the age of seventeen, wrote Mar iam, the Fair Queen of Jewry, and thus became the first English woman to write a full-length play. This trage- dy concerns the story of Herod and Mari amne , and it is based on Josephus's Antiquities . Cary' s daughter wrote a detailed biography of her mother. When one compares The Lady Falkland ; Her Life to Mar iam, strong simi- larities appear between the life of Elizabeth Cary and the two most prominent figures in her play, Mariam and Salome. [LAP] 5459 Schuldiner, Michael. "Edward Taylor's 'Problematic' Imagery," EAL, 13 (Spring 1978), 92-101. Some of Taylor's poems which appear to contain inconsistent or especially difficult imagery may be better appreciated by referring to sources available to Taylor. For example, the seeming inconsistency in Meditation 1.20 of Christ's ascending a ladder and His ascending in a chariot can be explained by studying Psalm 104:3 and by referring to a passage in Bythner's Lyra Prophetica (a work Taylor owned) . [MHM] 5460 Seigel, Catharine F. "The Reconciliation in Book X of Paradise Lost, " MLR, 68 (April 1973), 260-3. Eve's part in the recon- ciliation scene of Book X is less noble than many critics think. Her repentance is directed not to God but to Adam. Her offer to accept sole punishment for their disobedience reveals not generosity, but ignorance of God's command. Her turning to Adam as an end in himself rather than to God shows how far she is from realizing her situation. Nevertheless, her role in Book X is intensely dramatic, and her efforts, along with Adam's, to enter once more into a true relationship with God are essentially paradigmatic of the human condition. 5461 Sims, James H. "Christened Classicism in Paradise Lost and The Lusiads, " CL, 24 (Fall 1972), 338-56. Milton may well have known the Portuguese epic Os Lusíadas or Sir Richard Fanshawe ' s translation of it or both. Parallels exist particularly in the use of pagan machin- ery within a Christian framework. Camo'ens and Milton extend the super- natural machinery of the epics of Homer and Virgil by inventing new Bibliography / 74</page><page sequence="12">personae for the pantheon as well as by using the familiar deities in new ways. They also share a synthesizing impulse, a desire to bring the Christian thesis into a nexus with a pagan antithesis, the Chris- tian sense of frailty and humble dependence on divine strength with the Promethean heroism of great achievement. The two writers are most alike in balancing the classical and Christian elements in unreconciled and unresolved suspense so as to highlight the truth of each. 5462 Smith, Don Noel. "The Artistry of John Donne's Devotions , " UDR, 10 (Summer 1973), 3-12. This occasional work, in a specifically religious prose form, reveals careful structural design. Rhetorically, each section, composed of meditation, expostulation, and prayer, may be classified as expository, argumentative, and supplicative . Donne's illness and subsequent events determine the dramatic action. Focusing on man's helplessness, Devotions centers in the patient, his illness, God, the physicians, and bells. 5463 Stanwood, P.G. "John Donne's Sermon Notes," RES, 29 (August 1978), 313-20. A recently noticed manuscript in Trinity College, Dublin, contains notes of two Donne sermons made by a contemporary. They let us view more clearly Donne's activities at this time, plausi- bly date an undated sermon, suggest the time and occasion of a series of sermons, and provide the earliest manuscript of Donne's prose.

Witnessing Pros- pero 's problems in controlling his creations, the audience gains some conception of God ' s problems . EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 5465 Canfield, John Douglas. Nicholas Rowe and Christian Tragedy . Gainesville, Florida: University Presses of Florida, 1977. 212 pp. $8.50. Canfield' s thesis is that central to a full understanding of Rowe' s tragedies is something that has heretofore been either ignored or given short shrift by the critics: the "religious dimension" of the plays, and specifically the "Christian solution" to the "problems of Suffering and sin." That solution requires man to avoid the sin of despair and to place his trust in God's providence. A "reading" of the seven tragedies primarily from this point of view comprises the bulk of the book. 5466 Dennis, Christopher M. "A Structural Conceit in Smart's 'Song to David,'" RES, 29 (August 1978), 257-266. Perhaps the most "struc- tural conceit" of Christopher Smart's "A Song to David," David's harp, has escaped general notice. This conceit is central to Smart's concep- tion of his own role as psalmist. Carefully worked into the poem's structure, the conceit relates perfectly to Smart's personal typology. [LDC] 5467 Helms, Randel. "Ezekiel and Blake's Jerusalem, " SIR, 13, No. 2 (Spring 1974) , 127-40. The differences between the Book of Ezekiel and Jerusalem are more illuminating than the resemblances. Bibliography / 75</page><page sequence="13">Ezekiel' s wheel becomes what Blake hates in mechanized England, the "four living creatures" become the four Zoas, and the wheels of the divine chariot become the wheels of the deluded sons of Albion. While Ezekiel* s condemnations elicit our approval, in Blake condemna- tions turn ironically against the accuser. Ezekiel calls down deserved punishment upon Jerusalem; in Blake the exile of Jerusalem is necessary for her purgation. And while Ezekiel sees scrupulous observance of ritual as the path to redemption, for Blake it is the imaginative (artistic) labors of Los. 5468 Jackson, Wallace. "Roxana and the Development of Defoe's Fiction," SNNTS, 7 (Summer 1975), 181-94. This work is the culmination of Defoe's development as a novelist working out techniques for exploring character. Crusoe recognizes and works his way out of his state of sin into an enlightened Christian rule. Moll Flanders never transcends the adventures of the sinner in her repentance, but she controls her out- look on them and creates an inner harmony that reconciles her past and present views of herself. In contrast, Roxana cannot integrate her past and her present, tries to destroy the past in the murder of Susan, and ends up destroying herself. Her overriding vanity prevents a repentance like Moll's; it compels her to seek to share her guilt with others, especially the faithful Amy; and it adds to her final inner disintegration which makes her Defoe's triumph in psychological insight. 5469 Johnson, Clifford. "Defoe's Reaction to Enlightened Secularism: A Journal of the Plague Year, " EnlE , 3 (Fall-Winter 1973) , 169-77. For Defoe, religion and science were not mutually exclusive. In this work he unites theology with scientific information, documenting the plague as a historical occurrence while leading up to his narrator's ultimately religious interpretation of history. 5470 Kaiser, Leo M. "Three Hymns Attributed to George Moxon," EAL, 8 (Fall 1973) , 104-10. In his The First Century of New England Verse Harold Jantz tentatively identified three unpublished hymns as Moxon' s . (The texts follow.) 5471 Myers, Victoria. "The Dialogues as Interpretive Focus in Blake's The Four Zoas , " PQ, 56 (Spring 1977), 221-39. Blake uses simi- larities in the language of the dialogues and extended monologues of the Zoas and emanations to recall their one-time coexistence in Albion. Differences in language result from the Zoas' and emanations' attempts to establish independent personalities. Narration, therefore, provides contrast between fallen and Unfällen worlds and directs the progression of the poem toward reunion and redemption. [MOV] 5472 Robinson, William H. "Phillis Wheatley in London," CLAJ, 21 (Dec. 1977), 187-201. Traces Wheatley 's association with London - her visit there, the publication of her works, and their reception. Includes several manuscript letters, including Wheatley 's stinging re- buke of America, analogizing biblical Israelites and American Blacks. [MPH] 5473 Smith, John E. , gen- ed.

New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1977. 501 pp. $28.50. This fifth volume provides us with the authentic text of Edwards ' s An Humble Attempt . . . and supplies also his "Notes on the Apocalypse, " which is the first of many manuscripts to appear in print. It may be, as the editor, Stephen J. Stein, suggests, that these two titles, concerned as they are with apocalyptic speculation and millen- nial thought, may not "raise Edwards' intellectual or religious stock," but we have been in need of the whole canon before assessments can properly be made. A solid and very helpful 93-page introduction traces the apocalyptic tradition and Edwards' continuing interest in the topic, provides the range of his sources, and reviews the story of printed and manuscript texts. There are appendixes, a general index, and an index of biblical passages. 5474 Tanner, Michael. "Samuel Johnson's Cowardice," Listener, 89:2290 (February 15, 1973), 203-5. Johnson shies from self-exposure in deeply affectionate personal relationships, which may be one reason for his inadequacy as a novelist. His wisdom does not illuminate so much as confirm our understanding of ourselves. In philosophy, he is not prepared to face skepticism; in religion, he will not reconcile his own morality with his inherited traditional and less generous beliefs about God's mercy; and in private life, he has little experience of sexual relationships. 5475 Turner, A.J. "The Jeremy Collier Stage Controversy Again," N&amp;Q, 20 (Nov. 1973), 409-12. Minutes of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge for 1793-4 indicate that the group opposed theatri- cal productions after a severe storm (November 26-27, 1793), which it regarded as a manifestation of God's displeasure. A hitherto unknown letter written by the Society's secretary mentions the group's dis- pleasure at the production of Temp, only a few days after the storm and indicates its anti-stage activities. 5476 Walters, David. "The Park and Whiting Family Stones Revisited: The Iconography of the Church Covenant," CRevAS, 9 (Spring 1978), 1-15. Gravestones of the Grafton and Rockingham, Vermont, cemeteries attest to a theological and iconographie tradition of Congregationalism of the late 1700' s . Prevalent sun and vegetation imagery affirms the belief that parents' sainthood provided hope for the salvation of their deceased children. [SRP] NINETEENTH CENTURY 5477 Albanese, Catherine L. Corresponding Motion : Transcendental Religion and the New America. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1977. 210 pp. $15.00. Albanese 's purpose in writing this book is to reveal the transcendentalists as "preeminently religious figures who understood their own enterprise in terms of the sacred." In her task Albanese has focused on the original six members of the Transcen- dental Club, and on their periodical publication The Dial , in the years 1836-44. Primary emphasis is on Ralph Waldo Emerson. The author has brought techniques of history of religions to her service in defining the kind of religion transcendentalism represents. A highly sophisti- cated linguistic analysis is made of the language with which the group Bibliography / 77</page><page sequence="15">characteristically spoke of religion. Emphasis is laid on the commun- ity sense of the group and on the movement's relation to the evolution of distinctively American themes. 5478 Asprin, Roy. "Father to the Brontes: The Family Tragedies Be- hind the Literary Success," TW, 2, No. 13 (29 June 1978), 7-8. "The letters, writings, . . . sermons [and life] of Patrick Bronte reveal a deeply sympathetic personality totally different from the bullying, narrow-minded parson of popular legend, while his full diary also crowds out the notion that he lived a closeted life." [PSG] 5479 Barrett, William. "The Faith to Will," ASch, 47 (Autumn 1978), 525-36. For William James religion was "not an adventitious curiosity attached to his pragmatism; it is in fact central to his view of things, just as he believed the religious concern to be central to life itself." Yet "he does not speak, nor does he profess to speak, from within the attitude of faith." Rather, he writes about religious faith. [wSM] 5480 Beck, William J. "Flaubert's Tripartite Concept of History and Trois Contes , " CLAJ, 21 (Sept. 1977), 74-78. Trois Contes symbolize "the esthetic, and perhaps the religious, inner conflict of Gustave Flaubert." Characters choose either self-abnegation or pil- grimage into the past to escape "the ennui of bourgeois existence." [MPH] 5481 Cain, Thomas Grant Steven. Tolstoy. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1977. 210 pp. $17.50. A relatively short critical work dealing with Tolstoy's chief works. Cain is mainly concerned with the develop- ment in these works of Tolstoy's basic theme: the meaning of life, the answer to the question, In what lies true happiness? Cain shows how these basic concerns are treated in Tolstoy from the very beginning, and how the answers are enriched or changed as Tolstoy ages, passes through his famous conversion, and finally formulates for himself his own brand of Christian anarchy. 5482 Fox, Linda C. "The Vision of Cain and Abel in Spain's 'Generation of 1898,'" CLAJ, 21 (June 1978), 499-512. For these Spanish writers the "image of Cain and Abel was more than a recurring literary theme: it was an assessment of a fundamental aspect of the national character which would once again plunge the country . . . into . . . fratricidal war." [MPH] 5483 Gilmore, Michael T. The Middle Way: Puritanism and Ideology in American Romantic Fiction. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1977. 220 pp. $12.00. One of many books on nine- teenth-century American literature that attempt to gather its many facets under a single rubric. That rubric fails, however, to control the argument of the book; the Puritan "middle" of the title is a middle between so many different aspects of American culture that con- tinuity is lost in a maze of critical aperçus. These, in turn, are often of the most tenuous kind. They are almost all reducible to the formula: X must have been aware of (there follows a summary of a Bible passage, a historical event, a literary source); X, then, must Bibliography / 78</page><page sequence="16">have meant (there follows an allegorical interpretation of some object, event, or character) . 5484 Griffith, Kelly, Jr. "Weir Mitchell and the Genteel Romance," AL, 44, No. 2 (May 1972), 247-61. Mitchell's literary work belongs to the tradition of "genteel romance," which flourished in America from about 1890 to 1910. Though the genteel romance is usually defined in terms of its form, its most distinctive character- istic is the value system it propounds, and Mitchell's work exempli- fies these values: Protestant Christianity, an aristocratic code of honor, a rationalistic metaphysics, and American patriotism. 5485 Hyde, Virginia M. "The Fallible Parchment: Structure in Brown- ing's 'A Death in the Desert,'" VP, 12 (Summer 1974), 125-35. The form of the poem, comprising a prologue, monologue, and epilogue, reflects the past, present and future of the church. Where skeptics would point out gross inconsistencies in Christian texts, Browning asserts the strength of a great body of tradition. Opposed to the cultist arguments advanced by Ernest Renan (Life of Jesus , 1863) and David Strauss (The Life of Jesus, 1835) , Browning argues for the value of a communal tradition. 5486 Jerome, Robert D. , and Herbert A. Wisbey, Jr., eds. Mark Twain in Elmira . Elmira, New York: Mark Twain Society, 1977. 242 pp. $8.00. The volume's one noteworthy essay, Max Eastman's "Mark Twain's Elmira," describes the liberal Christianity of the Langdons and their influential minister Thomas K. Beecher (half brother of Henry Ward) . Eastman argues that there was "a hardier and deeper grounded 'radical- ism' in the Park Church culture into which Mark Twain married than there was in Mark Twain . " 5487 Littlefield, Daniel F., Jr. "Longfellow's 'A Psalm of Life': A Relation of Method to Popularity," MarkhamR, 7 (Spring 1978), 49-51. Primarily interested in source and methodology, Littlefield discusses Longfellow's popular poem in relationship to Franklin's "The Way to Wealth." The poem's didacticism was accepted because people "recognized the aphorism" and because the truths were philosophically comfortable and familiar. "It was successful in terms of the adaption of mode to apparent purpose." [COE] 5488 Lozynsky, Artem. "Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke: A Religious Disciple of Whitman," In Studies in the American Renaissance. Ed. Joel Myerson. Boston: Twayne, 1977, pp. 387-403. The author contends that Bucke should be seen and studied as a religious rather than a literary disciple of Whitman. Bucke 's works on Whitman were attempts to "docu- ment" his divinity. [LRL] 5489 Molson, Francis J. "Two Little Pilgrims ' Progress : The 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition as Celestial City," MarkhamR, 7 (Spring 1978) , 55-9. In Two Little Pilgrims ' Progress, Frances Burnett employed the moral and religious authority of The Pilgrim' s Progress to provide his characters' journey to Chicago and the Columbian Exposition with moral and religious significance. In doing so, however, Burnett undermined the orthodoxy and rigor of Bunyan's work, and he secularized Bibliography / 79</page><page sequence="17">and vulgarized the Christian notion of heaven. [ODE] 5490 O'Donnell, Patrick. "Zones of the Soul: Emily Dickinson's Geo- graphical Imagery," CLA J, 21 (Sept. 1977), 62-73. India repre- sents a Paradisal or mystical vision for Dickinson; Peru is worldly wealth. Mountains can symbolize God's grandeur, volcanoes the workings of the human spirit, inland seas spiritual renewal. She also uses the traditional points of the compass to symbolize spiritual states.

Nagaraja. "Philosophy of Love in Shelley's Poetry," Triveni , 42 (January-March 1974), 74-7. In "Queen Mab" and "Ozy- mandias" Shelley takes a somewhat Christian attitude toward love, seeing in the later work human benefactors like Jesus and Mohammed as superior to tyrants. For Shelley, love was "wisdom, nature, God, or beauty." He was passionate in his belief in love and equally passionate in his hatred of hate "in any form." 5494 Robinson, John. In Extremity : A Study of Gerard Manley Hopkins . Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978. 175 pp. $14.95. Robinson's interpretations of the Irish sonnets and the major or the most interesting poems are straightforward and generous. With intelli- gence and perception, he writes of the limitations he finds with the poetry, never losing sight of Hopkins's poetics and his direction. Robinson acknowledges "the strenuousness of his relic '-dus conviction, the solitariness of his very genius, the intensity c." his love of Eng- land, and the ardour of his desire for excellence" as the elements that acted to focus his attention on "the ultimate aloneness of his self," culminating in the extraordinary poetry Hopkins made during the miserable Irish years at the end of his life . He writes of Hopkins ' s view of beauty and of Man/man, of his philosophy of form, his poetic theory, his aesthetic in the context of his dedication to the Society of Jesus, of his Catholicism, of the Victorian era. He discusses at some length the influences of Parmenides, Plato, and Duns Scotus and the oppositions to Pater's thinking that contributed to Hopkins's development. 5495 Shapiro, Arnold. "Brother Newman and Bishop Blougram," SBHC, 1 (Fall 1973) , 59-66. Browning was thinking of Newman while he composed "Bishop Blcugram's Apology." While there is no concrete proof that the poet had read Newman's Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England , he was aware of the controversy surrounding them. 5496 Swaminathan, S.R. "Keats 's 'Epistle to Reynolds' and Scott's 'Marmion,'" N&amp;Q, 21 (Sept. 1974), 333-4. Association of ideas makes it probable that in referring to Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim in Bibliography / 80</page><page sequence="18">this work, Keats was not inventing a name, as his editors and critics have supposed; he is making a playful allusion to St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, alluded to in "Marmion." Also, details of "heathen and Christian styles of architecture" in Scott's poem seem to be reflected in Keats 's. 5497 Tedd, Robert E. "The Magna Mater Archetype in The Scarlet Letter , " NEQ, 45 (Sept. 1972), 421-9. Hester Prynne is a source of both destruction and rebirth, a bipolar figure typifying Jung's "anima" or magna mater archetype. Hawthorne describes her first appearance by comparing her to the Virgin Mary. She brings spiritual death to Dimmes- dale in the biblical sense that "the wages of sin is death." But he dies only after she has redeemed him during their encounter in the forest. Her embrace of the dying minister resembles the Pieta. 5498 Wear, Richard. "Further Thoughts on Browning's Spanish Cloister," VP, 12 (Spring 1974), 67-70. While the speaker in the "Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister" reflects an unchristian mind, there is little to suggest that he would mock Vesper bells (in "'Hy, Zy, Hine'" (1. 70)). He is apparently knowledgeable in Latin and Greek and enjoys taunting brother Lawrence. Lawrence, for his part, knows little of Latin: he breaks into joyful song and prayer at the sound of Vespers, but mangles the prayer (which the speaker then mimics) . TWENTIETH CENTURY 5499 Adler, Thomas P. "Religious Ritual in John Arden' s Sergeant Mus- grave ' s Dance , " MD, 16, No. 2 (Sept. 1973), 163-6. In keeping with Arden 's concern with medieval drama, the central event in this play is a parodie perversion of the crucifixion; yet even this emblem of memento mori does not hint at man's regeneration or salvation. 5500 Allen, Joan M. Candles and Carnival Lights : the Catholic Sensi- bility of F . Scott Fitzgerald. The Gotham Library of the New York University Press. New York: New York University Press, 1978. 163 pp. $15.00. This intelligent study of the effects of Fitzgerald's Catholic upbringing on his life and art is a welcome addition to the body of Fitzgerald criticism. Joan Allen presents a clear, convincing portrait of the essential conflict in Fitzgerald: between his attraction to glamour and materialism, and his rigid, even prudish, moralism. In treat- ing this central problem, Allen illuminates several related issues: the sense of inadequate paternity, ambivalence about money, and perhaps most significant, the "squeamishness about sex in a writer proclaimed as risque .

Sutter Creek, California: Quintessence Pub. , Bibliography /81</page><page sequence="19">1978. 294 pp. $20.00, The central study of Jeffers's poetry itself is a sound, straightforward consideration of the views of God and Man found in the lyrical poems, although, consistent with the tone of the whole volume, Beilke is more descriptive and appreciative than rigor- ously "critical." What he does establish through a knowledgeable, chronological survey of Jeffers's canon is the centrality, clarity, and consistency of Jeffers's theology - that there is one God of all creation, not to be diminished or circumscribed by any anthropomorphic formulation, but discerned pantheistically in all of nature in His beauty . 5503 Berkove, Lawrence I. "American Midrashim ; Hugh Nissenson's Stories," Crit , 20 (1978), 75-80.

"Alienation and Humanization, Damnation and Salvation in Voss," Mean j in, 30 (June 1971), 208-16. Beston justifies sub- stituting her terms (the last two) for White's (the first two) by claim- ing that they get their "chief significance" in White's work "in psycho- logical or . . . human terms." The reasons why Voss moves toward inte- gration into society and Laura does not (though both start as more or less equally "frightened, insecure people") is due marginally to external events and primarily to their different responses to what they see as threats to their identity.

"In Hurtle Duf field, White offers his portrait of the New Man . . . appropriate to this age in which we live . . . someone tougher and more honest than the rest of us, more feeling and yet more able to endure the full range of experience which we prefer to evade." White identifies God with the sheer physical facts of all that exists, with what Simone Weil (who has influenced him greatly) calls "necessity."

The system of beliefs which enables Avison to achieve a consummate synthesis of the religious and the secular is built upon the imposition of an enduring quality on the flux of time by means of love; life thus becomes "a large breathed Day," a partaking of the eternal.

Girard replies to criticism, places his work in the context of other critics and philosophers, and discusses the Bible from a literary and ethnological perspective. The Bible reinterprets analogous myths of victimage by siding with the scapegoat. The Bible reveals the prin- ciple of victimage as lying behind the "idolatry" of all human culture and provides a key to the renunciation of all violence. [GEV] 5514 Gledhill, Jane. "F.R.

Avison's The Dumbfounding and Alfred Purdy' s North of Summer are "the most ambitious" of the seven books looked at. The Dumbfounding is more accessible than her first volume, Winter Sun, though the poems "are still often oblique, full of odd movements."

Theo- sophical views about the afterlife, particularly ghostly survival and reincarnation, are reflected in several of his dramatic and prose works. Rejecting religious interpretations, "Pirandello has successfully blended" such concepts "with his relativistic perception of reality and human psychology." [CAH] 5522 Kavanagh, P.J. "J.C. Powys - A Glastonbury Romance," Theology , 80 (1977), 10-15. Now that our age has recovered from the spiritual self-denial of a generation ago, Powys is due for a revival. His huge work is full of energy, and he "endow [s] everything . . . with a life and spirit of its owm." "I put down his book with more life in me than when I picked it up.

Their central, untrammeled thought indicates the renewal of life symbolized by the passion of Christ and the triumph of the resurrection." 5524 Kennedy, X.J, "Five Poets In Search of Six Lines," Poetry (May 1961) , 118-23. The poems in Winter Sun have, as a result of being written over twenty-five years, an unusual "sharpness and . . . kick." The "unpitying and clear light of her ambitious art exposes man's isolation in suburbia and prairie," and man's making lovely land- scapes barren - "ideal vista [is] set against hardscrabble reality" in a volume of work that "ought to put Margaret Avison in the fore of" Canadian poetry . [PSG] 5525 Kopper, Edward A., Jr. "A Note on the Religious Imagery in The Alexandria Quartet," StTCL, No. 10 (Fall 1972), 115-20. Lawrence Durrell's use of religious imagery shows a somewhat "patronizing and half comprehending view of theology." His attitude toward the Eucharist is "an awkward mingling of the farcical with the sublime." Scobie is the most important religious personage in the "Quartet" and allows Durrell "to satirize Catholicism and its more spiritual doctrines to establish ideas of human behavior." Scobie 's cake stand, alluded to five times in the tetralogy, is a kind of altar; his parrot burlesques the responses of the acolyte; his laying on of hands fertilizes friends physically and spiritually. 5526 Kranz, Gisbert. "Die Neue Woge Christlicher Literature," SchR, 73 (May- June 1974) , 156-70. "No, Christian literature is not dead ....

"Gathering Fragments, Making Meaning: The Poetry of Catherine deVinck," CrossC, 27 (Winter 1977-8), 395-402. "In contrast to much of modern poetry which laments the disruption, un- certainty, and meaninglessness of the human condition, Catherine deVinck' s poetry echoes with affirmations strong enough to transform reality, to gather the fragments of life into human design, to make meaning." Images of art-making and love-making recur in poetry which combines sensuality and transcendence to express a mode of belief which finds God "in the world" as we come to know Him "through the world." [JQE] 5528 Lennox, John Watt. "The Past: Themes and Symbols of Confronta- tion in The Double Hook and Le Torrent , " JCF, 2 (Winter 1973) , 70-2. In Hebert' s work, François, a Narcissus-figure, struggles to escape the influence of his mother, who represents the repressive influence of the Roman Catholic Church and social, intellectual, and political leadership in French Canada. By contrast, Watson shows her protagonist, James Potter, successfully resolving his conflicts with himself and his commu- nity with the aid of the Christ-like activities of his mother, and bettering the community.

"The Satanic Rape of Catholicism in Rosemary 1 s Baby," SAF , 2 (August 1974), 211-22. The Satanists1 rape of Rosemary Woodhouse, a non-practising Catholic, in Ira Levin's novel, turns her back to her faith with a heightened awareness that her gro- tesque motherhood provides her with the means to destroy the Satanists1 evil. 5531 MacCallum, Hugh. "Poetry," UTQ (July 1967), 354-7. Margaret Atwood and Avison, while totally different in other respects, share the crucial capacity of bringing "real mythopoeic power to bear upon experience" and require "an intellectual as well as a sensuous response." The religious pieces introduce a new note of commitment and a new lyrical freedom into Avison' s work. [PSG] 5532 Mackey, Nathaniel. "Ishmael Reed and the Black Aesthetic," CLA J, 21 (March 1978) , 355-66. Reed rejects Blacks whose assumptions are Euro-Christian as "a handful of Christian-socialist intellectuals and professors 'crouching under the veil' (ugh!) of the 'Black Christ,' and, most recently, the 'Black Lenin.'" Christianity and Marxism took all the humor, freedom, and joy out of African art. [MPI!] 5533 Mandel, E.W. "The New Books: Margaret Avison's Winter Sun," QQ (Winter 1961), 704-5. Avison provides a "remarkably luminous set of clues to her meaning": she is fascinated by "the puzzling trans- formations effected by metaphor, perspective or dramatic point of view," by "the interplay of abstract and concrete, minuteness and vastness, experience and vision, which is the dialectic of her poems." [PSG] 5534 Marcus, Mordecai. "E.A. Robinson's Flammonde: Towards Some Essential Clarification," MarkhamR, 3 (Oct. 1972), 77-80. This work presents three large problems among other smaller ones. (1) Flam- monde is clearly associated with Christ, through his punning name (light of the world) and his Christ-like acts, but how can a Christ-like figure have significant flaws and be identified with the Prince of Castaways? (2) How reliable are the narrator and his point of view, especially in the assumption that Flammonde has fallen in station and hides within himself some terrible flaw? (3) What message is conveyed to the dwellers in Tilbury Town by the sudden new memory of Flammonde signalled at the poem's end? It can be concluded that Flammonde is like Satan in his fall and in suffering the threat of self-destruction; but he has put aside his failure, and presumably his pride, to succeed in the common world with actions like those of Christ. He is a human being but an extraordinary one. 5535 Merton, Thomas. The Collected Poems of Thomas Merton. New York: New Directions, 1977. 1046 pp. $37.50. There are really two Mertons: one the Sufi, the mystic, the desert saint totally involved with the rhythms (and imagery - the "style") of the liturgical year; the other (who makes his appearance as a poet in Cables to the Ace, 1968) Bibliography / 86</page><page sequence="24">the ontological experimentalist who manages to see and react to the contemporary world from the marvelous distance of monasticism. The work of this second Merton is very reminiscent of Charles Olson, and Cables to the Ace and The Geography of Lograire (1968) do hold a candle to the Maximus Poems and/or (to extend the range) W.C. Williams' Paterson . This makes this volume of collected poems not merely a relic for pietists but a learning-book for all contemporary poets . 5536 McCluskey, John. "In the Mecca," SBL, 4 (Autumn 1973), 25-30. This long poem, a symphony of black voices, exhibits a religious sensibility established by three of the characters: St. Julia Jones, Prophet Williams, and Alfred; their hopes foreshadow the fate of Pepita, a symbol of innocence in a hostile world. Although Brooks' tone today is more sober, it is still a quest for harmony - with Christianity, an indifferent world, and harshness. 5537 Mitchell, Beverly. "Association and Allusion in The Double Hook , " JCF , 2 (Winter 1973), 63-9. The strange events in Ashcroft, B.C., are best understood by reference to Northrop Frye's idea of a demonic desert filled with Old Testament references which Watson carefully adapts to British Columbia. Almost every character is based on an Old Testament prototype: Coyote, for instance, is both Yahweh and Jehovah combined with the trickster-god of the West-coast Indians. James Potter, the main character, moves through a complete Genesis-Apocalypse mythic pattern, and Felix, the only undemonic character, is conceived in terms of Isaiahan Christology and the Latin liturgy. 5538 Montgomery, Marion. "Flannery O'Connor and the Jansenist Problem in Fiction," SoR, 14 (July 1978), 438-48. O'Connor has been termed as a Jansenist in her fiction although she insists her charac- ters have free will. This charge may come as a result of the importance grace plays in her work. In the end, however, her characters always have options open to them. She leaves "possibility" suspended. [MHM] 5539 Morgenthau, Hans, et sļL. "The Roots of Narcissism," PR, 46, No. 3 (1978), 337-47. Man "has been created in the image of God," but "the gap between nature and divinity cannot be bridged." Hence man is alienated. Even modern nationalism has lost its appeal. Man has only three alternatives: chaos, an order imposed from without, or an order organically grown from new experiences. [WSM] 5540 Morot-Sir, Edouard. "Pascal Versus Wittgenstein, with Samuel Peckett as the Anti-Witness," RomN, 15 (Winter 1973), 201-16. In the story "Le Depeupleur" (The Lost Ones) Beckett uses Wittgenstein's metaphor of non-scientific language as a ladder to say that one cannot, as Wittgenstein suggests, throw away the ladder, nor can one restrain her urge to climb it. Pascal would say to Beckett that his ladder "must be leaned against the cross" in order to be supported. Pascal's theory of language is that its two sources are human and divine. Jesus Christ is the mediator between the two languages, and in prayer, language finally reaches meaningfulness as the divine and human are unified in Christ. Thus Pascal, Beckett, and Wittgenstein all agree that "the final problematics of mankind is linguistic," all study the logic of meaning, and all use metaphor to solve the inevitability of contradictions: Bibliography / 87</page><page sequence="25">but they stand in fundamental confrontation. 5541 Murphy, Vincent J. "Being and Perception; Beckett's Film," MP, 28 (March 1975) , 43-8. In Film, the "to be is to be per- ceived by God" of the Berkeleian world becomes the more Proustian "to be is to be perceived by oneself." 5542 Newton-de Molina, David, ed. The Literary Criticism of T.S^. Eliot: New Essays . London: Athlone Press, 1977. 216 pp. $13.00. These new essays are a worthy attempt at historical reappraisal of Eliot's critical orthodoxy. The essays, all by distinguished inter- national scholars, place the poet's literary criticism in the context of his poetry and drama as well as his Christian philosophy. Baude- laire, Arthur Symons, Dante, Dryden, Matthew Arnold, I.A. Richards, D.H. Lawrence, "Uncle Ez" - their influence is felt throughout. 5543 Peplow, Michael W. "George Schuyler, Satirist: Rhetorical De- vices in Black No More , " CLA J, 18 (Dec. 1974), 242-57. This is the first sustained satire by a black American author. The irony of Christianity woven into a lynching scene, presented in the manner of Swift, Pope, and Heller, as a parody of a religious celebration, de- picts a misanthropic Schuyler lashing out savagely and futilely against the subversion of human values. 5544 Preston, Thomas R. "Christian Folly in the Fiction of J.F. Powers," Critique , 16 (1974), 91-107. Powers's priest stories, "rarely about priests at all," express his vision of the Christian life which "proceeds from the Pauline conviction that the Christian who has true faith will abandon the wisdom of the world and become a fool for Christ's sake." 5545 Reaney, James. "Turning New Leaves," CanadianF (March 1961).

University, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977) , assumes that religion, "gone for good," must be replaced by a secular absolute to withstand barbarism in the modern world, and that Stevens' poems appeal for such an abso- lute. In fact, Stevens fails to attach public significance to the symbolism of his private world. [SRP] 5552 Sharp, Corona (Sister). "The Dance of Death in Modern Drama: Auden, Diirrenmatt and Ionesco," MD, 20 (1977), 107-16. In addi- tion to modern stagings of the medieval Dance of Death and related pageants, a renewed interest in this theme has also brought forth "more original adaptations." Auden1 s The Dance of Death (1933) "parodies medieval didacticism in a half -serious exaltation of Marxism." Durren- matt' s The Meteor (1966), heavily indebted to Strindberg, uses a "gro- tesque . . . Lazarus-figure" to dramatize the plight of man in the modern world and "to convey the theological statement of real resurrec- tion." Ionesco' s Massacre Games (1970) presents death as a joke, drawing selectively on Defoe's account of the plague. Yet his surreal- ism "reflects the allegorical quality of the medieval Dances," and his "mystical bent" hints at a transcendent reality beyond the absurd. The comic qualities by which Dürrenmatt and Ionesco "distance [death's] horror from themselves" lay bare a similar comic intent hidden under the didacticism of the medieval Dance of Death. 5553 Smith, A.J.M. "Critical Improvisations on Margaret Avison's Winter Sun," TamR, 19 (Winter 1961), 81-6. Commends the bold- ness, originality, and all-inclusiveness of Avison's words, images, and conceits. "The peculiar virtue of this poetry arises from the intimacy with which the poet invites us to share her improvisational insights and home-made constructs . . . rarely has a poet so compactly and richly identified sensation and thought. If there really has been a dissociation of sensibility, here we return magnificently to the old unity." [PSG] 5554 Smith, A.J.M. "Margaret Avison's New Book," CanadianF , 46 (October 1966) , 132-4. The Dumbfounding is "beyond question . . . the richest, most original, most fully and deeply engaged and therefore the most significant book" of modern Canadian poetry, because of "the peculiar, searching intensity of her sensibility and the verbal and metrical adequacy of its expression"; and because of her "synthetic . . . intuitive power of seeing, feeling, smelling connections so that Bibliography /89</page><page sequence="27">nothing exists alone and nothing is without the significance of every- thing." [PSG] 5555 Soldo, John J. "The American Foreground of T.S. Eliot," N&amp;Q, 45 (Sept. 1972), 355-72. Eliot's reactions against his family origins and cultural context were largely responsible for his original- ity. He chose to adhere to the Calvinistic and Puritanical beliefs of his ancestor, Andrew Eliott, and, convinced of man's profound capa- bility for sin and evil, he repudiated nineteenth-century liberal Protestantism. The Unitarianism of his immediate predecessors "could not provide material for Eliot, the revolutionary artist." 5556 Spivey, Herman E. "Faulkner and the Adamie Myth: Faulkner's Moral Vision," MFS , 19 (Winter 1973-74), 497-505. An examina- tion of Faulkner's use of the Adamie myth reveals his moral and re- ligious views, which are consistent throughout his writings. The Adamie myth is apparent in The Reivers . Lucius is initiated into evil and discovers that he must accept the consequences of his sin and bear the burden of his guilt. Faulkner's moral vision includes elements from four ethical traditions strong in Southern culture: the Hellenic, the Hebraic, the Christian humanist, and the Stoic. His awareness of human conduct and of the power of evil led him to believe in man's ability to cope with his environment and the human condition by accept- ing them and by also retaining at least some of his personal freedom. 5557 Stanford, Donald E. "The Poetry of James Agee: The Art of Recovery," SoR, 10 (April 1974), xvi-xix. Agee (1909-55) has been forgotten as a poet. His work contains successful imitations of Tudor, Elizabethan, Jacobean, Metaphysical, and Byronie styles, and a rhetoric sometimes reminiscent of Hart Crane and Allen Tate. In re- covering the styles and forms of past centuries he also recovered the subject matters of love and serious Christian faith. His viewpoint was High Church Anglo-Catholic . His "Chorale" and some of his love poems deserve a place in anthologies of modern poetry. 5558 Stewart, Jack F. "Christian Allusions in 'Big-Two-Hearted River,'" SSF , 15 (Spring 1978) , 194-6. The section of the story about Hopkins contains several Christian allusions. Hopkins' giving gifts so that he will be remembered is reminiscent of the Last Supper. When Nick drinks "coffee according to Hopkins," it is like a disciple following a ritual established by his master. Even Nick's rejection of this communion with Hopkins points to the need for each person to seek his own salvation . [MHM] 5559 Taylor, Richard.

Not only has he given up drugs, but he has adopted a "philosophical and almost sermonical" habit. He had been converted to religion, probably by the evangelist Rev. Charles Haddon Spurgeon, active in London in Holmes's time. 5565 Webb, Eugene. "Self and Cosmos: Religion as Strategy and Explora- tion in the Novels of E.M. Forster," Soundings , 59 (Summer 1976), 186-203. "Forster 's real choice as a writer and thinker was not between agnosticism and evasions, but between an inherited cosmos and an indivi- dually constructed one. He was an agnostic with regard to the first, and a serious religious explorer with regard to the second," and thus, "to understand Forster 's art," one must consider "the effort of world- construction which he seriously intended." 5566 White, Hayden. "Ethnological 'Lie' and Mythical 'Truth,'" Dia- critics, 8 (Spring 1978) , 2-9. A discussion and critique of critic and philosopher René Girard, who argues that human culture is based upon religion - specifically, the rite of sacrifice whereby violence is sublimated through the death of a scapegoat victim. The purpose of "truly great" art is to reveal the truth of Religion. Thus, for Girard, the content of all novels is desire, but desire deflected from God, its true object. In the "truly great novels" the falseness of the worldly goals is progressively revealed, so that they end in Christian revela- tion or "the conversion in death" of the hero. Girard 's attack on Modernism, based mainly on post-structuralist philosophy and myth criti- cism, is placed in the tradition of other "great apologists of Reaction."
