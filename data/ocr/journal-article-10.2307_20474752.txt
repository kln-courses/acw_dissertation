<plain_text><page sequence="1">'PASSIO CARITATIS' ACCORDING TO ORIGEN IN EZECHIELEM HOMILIAE VI IN THE LIGHT OF DT 1,31 BY SAMUEL FERNANDEZ EYZAGUIRRE ABSTRACT: The idea of divine impassibility, which was firmly established in philosophical traditions, was also sustained by early Christian thinkers. Biblical references to God's passions were regarded as anthropomorphic expressions, which had to be interpreted in a metaphorical sense. Origen adheres to this type of interpretation, but in his sermons on Ezekiel he deals explicitly with God's caritatis passio, so that he appears to bring about un undeniable contradiction between divine impassibility and divine passibility. Origen solves this problem by arguing that the 'passion of charity' or 'philan thropy' must belong to the pre-existent Logos. In fact, it is the very reason for incarnation. Biblical and patristic traditions contain abundant data on the passion of Christ as the incarnate Logos, and origenian doctrine follows such tradi tion.' Nevertheless, in some texts, the Alexandrian develops an interesting reasoning on the suffering of God the Father as well. This reflection causes an apparent conflict between the philosophical and the biblical visions regarding God. Whereas divine impassibility is a concept typically associated to philosophy, God's passions are frequently shown in biblical texts, mainly proceeding from the Old Testament, endowing God with a human's image and passions (anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms). This conflict gives a particular interest to reflections on divine suffering in an author who, as Origen, has been so influenced by Greek thought. In order to weigh these origenian statements, it is advisable to briefly look into the prior Christian tradition.2 1 On the theological relevance of Christ's passion, cf. M. Simonetti, "La morte di Ges? in Origene", in Idem, Studi sulla cristologia del II e III sec?lo. Studia Ephemeridis Augustinianum 44, 1993, pp. 145-182. Above all, go to pp. 164-167 on the expiatory character of the passion of Christ. 2 Abundant material is found in H.

Divine passio in Christian tradition prior to Origen The so-called Apostolic Fathers with their statements regarding God the Father's mercy, magnanimity, wrath, rage and passion, as well as the pas sible character of God the Son in his economy, do no more than repeat the biblical outlook.3 Only Ignatius, in some of his writings makes direct refer ence to this subject. He proclaims the Logos as the impassible who, for our sake, turned passible,4 and in the well known hymn of Ephesians, he reminds us thatJesus Christ was first passible and later impassible.5 Apologists frequently sustain divine impassibility. In their claims against Greek gods they insist on the lack of passions in the true God.6 Thus, in the dialogue with contemporary culture, Athenagoras states that the God of Christians is uncreated, impassible and indivisible, and assimilates Christian faith regarding divine impassibility to the teachings of philosophers.7 Justin emphasises as well divine impassibiliy in contrast with Greek gods, and reminds us that the Son first appeared passible and shall, in the parousia, show himself glorious.8 Among the Valentinians, Theodotus' statement regarding divine passibil ity should be underlined. As it is known, the complex Gnostic myth sustains that passion had begun within the Pleroma, in Sophia, the youngest of the Eons, and was later expelled therefrom. But Theodotus' reflection goes fur ther when he states that the Supreme God is compassionate.9 Clement finds this statement irreverent since the acceptance of compassion in Almighty God amounts to admitting his passion ?because compassion is one's passion for the passion of another&gt;&gt;.

The same observation in Tertullian, vide infra, note 17.</page><page sequence="3">'PASSIO CARITATIS' ACCORDING TO ORIGEN 137 Clement of Alexandria, loyal to stoical tradition and in opposition with pagan religion, insists on divine impassibility.'1 The apparent contradiction between divine impassibility, as proclaimed by philosophy, and God's pas sions, as described in the Bible, is considered a semantic problem: it is not possible to speak about God such as he is in himself, we must be content to speak about him as we understand him: God, for our salvation, has adapted himself to our human weakness. Thus, divine passions, shown in the Scriptures, must be allegorically interpreted."2 Another thought on this subject is found among monarchians.'3 In order to support God's unity, they pretended that God the Father suffered on the cross. Noetus said that ?Christ was the vegy Father, and the vegy Father had been born, had suffered and had died&gt;&gt;.'4 Similar statements are also found in Tertullian's Adversus Praxean, which shows the unity of this doctrine.'5 A moderate monarchian such as Calixtus, in order to save divine impassibil ity declared, according to Ps.-Hippolytus, that &lt;&lt;the Father pities together with the Son&gt;&gt;, and Ps.-Hippolytus expressly states that Calixtus makes this declara tion &lt;&lt;because he does not want to say that the Father has suffered&gt;&gt;.'6 Both the author of the Refutatio and Tertullian see in this use of compassion a ridiculous solu tion to avoid avowing God's passion, which would amount to blasphemy.'7 Though we find here more explicit statements on divine passibility, it is use ful to remember that monarchians were not concerned directly with the pas sibility of the Father, but with the unity of God. Their debate is centred on divine unity, and the passibility of the Father is only a consequence of his unity with the Son. Thus, according to available data, the teaching regarding God's impassi bility, duly stated by philosophical tradition, is almost unanimously supported 11 Cf. Clement, Strom., 11,40,2; 81,1; IV,151,l-2; VI,73,6; 137,4; VII,13,3; 50,4; Protr., 32,1; 36,1. 12 Cf. Clement, Strom., 11,72,2-4; V,68,3. 13 Unfortunately, H.

Divine passibility or compassibility is maintained only by Theodotus among the valentinians and, with a different emphasis, by monarchians. In that period, to admit passions in God was considered blasphemous and was associated to pagan religion. II. Oragen and divine passio Many biblical expressions regarding God, if literally read, are rationally unacceptable, and Origen, therefore, systematically interprets them in a spiritual sense.'8 The Scripture contains anthropomorphical references to God so that men may understand &lt;that all that operates divine power is shown with human names or soiled with well known common human feelings. It is in this sense that it is said that God rages, listens or speaks&gt;&gt;.'9 This attitude in Origen is foreseeable, as it intends to show the biblical message according to Greek thought, within a polemic atmosphere in which he had to face many opponents. He had to face millenarists (who imagined a corporal Godhead20); pagans like Celsus (who ridiculed biblical anthropo morphisms2'); monarchians (who, to sustain divine unity, assumed God had suffered on the cross22), gnostics and marcionites (who endeavoured to prove the Creator's inferiority, based upon texts from the Old Testament which described his passions23). 18 Cf. In Mum. horn., XXIII,2: ?Haec autem omnia, in quibus vel lugere vet gaudere vel odisse vel laetari dicitur Deus, tropice et humano more accipienda sunt ab Scriptura dici. Aliena porro est divina natura ab omni passionis et permutationis qffectu, in illo semper beatitudinis ?pice immobilis et incon cussa perdurans?

Monaci Castagno, "Origene e Dionigi di Alessandria sulle promesse: continuit? e differenze", Annali di storia dell'esegesi, Bologna, 15 (1998) pp. 101-123.

Nevertheless, even in this context, there are certain origenian state ments supporting the passibility of God the Father. a. In Ezechielem homiliae, VI A very important development of this subject belongs to a homily which comments Ezekiel 16,5. In this biblical text God says he has not had enough mercy 'to suffer something foryour sake' (na0eiv -ri ?JC Goi).24 The context shows suffering as something positive in God, apparently contradicting the philo sophical and Christian traditions which consider impassibility to be a divine quality. Origen here refers to an example: I am going to give an example of men which, if the Holy Ghost permits, I shall then apply to Jesus Christ and God the Father. When I speak to a man and beg him for something, so that he may have pity on me, if he has no mercy he will not suffer (nihil patitur) for what I have said; if on the contrary, he is sensitive and there is nothing in him to harden his heart, he will listen to me and have mercy on me and his entrails shall quiver with my pleading. I want you to understand something similar regarding our Saviour: He descended to earth because he had mercy on the human gender, and so bore our passions before suffering on the cross and deigning to assume our flesh (passiones perpessus est nostras, antequam crucem pateretur et carnem nostram dignaretur assumere). If he had not suffered, he would not have come to share our human life. He suffered first and then he descended and revealed himself (primum passus est, deinde descendit et visus est). Now, which was this passion he suffered for us? It is the passion of charity (caritatis est passio). For the very Father, God of the uni verse, who is magnanimous, full of mercy and compassionate (Ps 102,8), doesn't he also suffer in some way? Do you ignore that, when he manages human reali ties, he suffers human passions? Verily the Lord, your God, assumed your manners (mores tuos) as a man would assume his son (Dt 1,31). So God assumes our manners as the Son of God bears our passions. The Father himself is not impassible (Ipse Pater non est impassibilis). If begged, he pities and condoles, he suffers for a certain charity (patitur aliquid caritatis), and gets to [conditions] in 24 It is necessary to bear in mind the LXX version: 'not even my eye had compassion on you, so as to perform in you all these [benefits cf. Ez 16,4], so as to suffer something for your sake' (o\)?? ?cpe?aocxo ? ?cpGocXuo? uou ?rcl ooi xo? 7ioifjaai aoi ?v ?K rcavxcov xo?xcov xo? 7ca0e?v xi ?nl aoi), cf. Ez 5,11; 7,6; 7,8; 8,18; 9,5; 9,10. In other texts, Origen uses the metaphor of the physician who cuts and burns to justify the goodness of he who does not pity, cf. In Ez. Cat., 1 (PG XIII, 789c); In Jer. horn., XII,5; S. Fern?ndez, Cristo M?dico, seg?n Or?genes.

These homilies, perhaps his most anti-gnostic and anti marcionist ones,26 endeavour to show the mercy of the God of the Old Testament. In the first place, he ascertains the passibility of the Logos prior to his incarnation (he calls this 'the passion of charity'), and secondly, cau tiously but clearly, he states that the God of the universe, in a certain way, also suffers (quodammodo patitur; Ipse Pater non est impassibilis27). These state ments seem to contradict other origenian texts which proclaim, along with Greek philosophical and patristic traditions,28 the absolute apatheia of both God the Father and the divine nature of the Logos. b. Other origenian texts on divine apatheia Other important statements are found in the rest of the origenian work to enlighten this subject. In De principiis he says 'God must be understood as com pletely impassible and devoid of all these passions'.29 In the Commentary on Ezekiel he declares &lt;&lt;God impassible, as well as immutable and uncreated&gt;&gt;,30 and in a fragment on John, he also proclaims divine impassibility.3' Likewise, the divine nature of the Logos is also declared impassible: ?The Saviour suffers what his Body, the Church, suffers, being he himse/fimpassible with regard to his diviniy&gt;&gt;.32 So, in the Prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, the request 25 In Ezechielem homiliae, VI,6 (GCS VIII, pp. 384-385). 26 ?Alle exegetischen Werke sind ziemlich gleichm??ig durchzogen von Polemik gegen die H?retiker (vielleicht am st?rksten die Ezechiel-Homilien)?: A. v.

Thus the Commentary on Lamentations states that when 'our passions' are applied to God, that should be tropologically understood, and further on, denies 'human passions' in God.34 On the other hand, however, Origen himself states that &lt;&lt;Out of mery, God 'co-suffers' (a:su-gaaXetl), for God does not lack entrails&gt;&gt;,35 and similarly in another homily on Ezekiel he exclaims, in an agnostic context: &lt;&lt;How good God is, who weeps even for those who have denied him! And this comes from a passion of love&gt;).36 And regarding the divine nature of the Logos, he declares: &lt;&lt;The impassible (o anaftO), as a lover of men, has suffered (nE40ovOev) through pitying&gt;&gt;.37 In another homily, Origen endeavours to save both extremes, presenting as dogmas, divine transcendence and immanence at the same time. The very transcen dent God looks after human realities: &lt;&lt;As we profess that God is incorporeal, almighty and invisible, so we confess as a true and invariable dogma that God looks after mortals and that nothing, in heaven or on earth, happens outside his Providence&gt;&gt;.38 How can this apparent contradiction between divine passibility and impassibility be solved? Following the same alexandrine method it is neces sary to search for the solution in other origenian texts. It would not be fair to take this as mere rhetorical assertion, so opposed to Origen's habits. The question is to understand the meaning of passio caritatis, by Origen. 1. The passio of the pre-existent Logos The origenian reflection on the passion of the pre-existent Logos has to do with the motives of incarnation. In the already mentioned homily on Ezekiel, Origen insists on the fact that the sufferings of the Logos in his pre existence are the cause and foundation of incarnation and, therefore, of his earthly sufferings: ?he sufferedfirst and then descended&gt;&gt;; incarnation is based upon 33 Ser. in Mt, 92 (GCS XI, p. 208).

The logic of the discourse shows that it deals with something further than a mere problem of language: there is a reality in the pre-existent Logos which causes incarnation, Origen calls this reality the passion of charity: Our Saviour who is the image of God, moved by his mercy towards man whom he had created in his resemblance, seeing that he, degrading such image, had taken that of the devil, impelled by mercy, assumed the image of man and came to him (ipse motus misericordia imagine hominis assumpta venit ad eum).39 Mercy is the cause of incarnation and, therefore, has to be admitted in the pre-existing Logos a certain passion (called mercy), which is not just a con sequence of incarnation but its very motive. Passion in the incarnate Logos is commonplace in patristic, its novelty lying in the search of the roots of this passion in a disposition belonging to pre-existence. The Commentagy on Matthew provides us with a text referring to this subject. Commenting on Mt 13,36 (having abandoned the multitudes, he went home), Origen points out: When Jesus is with the multitudes, he is not at home. And it is due to his love for men (potavOpndia) that he leaves his house and goes to those who are unable to come to Him.40 The act ofJesus leaving his house to meet the sick is interpreted as the exit of the Logos from God to meet men, that is to say, incarnation. It is worth while emphasising once again that the passion experienced by the Logos is not a consequence of incarnation but, on the contrary, its very cause. As is said in the homily on Ezekiel: &lt;&lt;f [the Logos] had not suffered [in pre-existence] he would not have come to share human lfe&gt;&gt;. Passion in divine nature is not the con sequence but the cause of incarnation. 2. God the Father's passio caritatis in the light of Nm 23,19 and Dt 1,31 Regarding the passion of God, our homily on Ezekiel states that God, ?when managing human realities, experiences a human passion&gt;&gt;, and in order to avoid the 39 In Gn. horn., 1,13 (GCS VI, p. 17). 40 In Mt.

If begged for, he pities and condoles; he suffers for a certain chariy&gt;&gt;. Nm 23,19 and Dt 1,31 give us a clue to understand the apparent contra diction between God's impassibility and passibility. To justify the impassi bility of God, Origen recurs to Nm 23,19: 'God [is] not like a man', and to justify his passibility, he uses Dt 1,31: 'The Lord, your God, adapted himself to you, as a man adapts himself to his son'. The verse of Dt 1,31 corresponds to the Septuaginta text, but with a meaningful change: &lt;&lt;The Lord, your God, fedyou as a man feeds his son&gt;&gt;:41 instead of po(popop@o (to feed), it uses tpono(pop@o (lit. to assume the tropos, to assume the manner of, to bear with one's moods; to adapt oneself42), and -rpono;, as a technical expression in literature, means way of saying. Thus Origen read: &lt;&lt; ?he Lord, your God, adopted your way of speaking, as man adopts the way of speaking of his son&gt;&gt;. This verse, along with Nm 23,19, is used by Origen, following Philo, to tackle the problem of language concerning God.43 We possess some developments on this subject, kept in their original Greek. a. Homily on Jeremiah XVIII,6. Its context is anti-marcionite, since it reacts against their purpose to deride the God of the Old Testament on account of his repentance and apparent ignorance.44 Origen, here, tries to explain why the Scripture speaks of God in a human manner, referring to the afore mentioned verses and reminding us that the Lord is not like a man (Nm 23,19) but adapts himself to men (Dt 1,31). He says: 41 Dt 1,31 (LXX): ?cb? ?xpocpocp?priGev ae K?pioc ? 0e?c aoi), cb? e? xi? xpo&lt;pocpopf|aei avOpomo? x?v m?v a?xo?)?.

V?tus Testamentum Graecum, vol. 111,2 Deuteronomium,J.W. Wevers (ed.), G?ttingen 1977, p. 63. The verb xp07co(pop?co does not appear in any other text of the Old Testament (LXX) and is found only once in the New Testament (Acts 13,18), but with a different meaning (hold). In Christian tradition there is no other author who quotes this text thus, with the exception of Didymus the Blind who, naturally, followed Origen, cf. In Ps. Com., 30,12; Didymos der Blinde. Psalmenkommentar, p. 152. Cf. J.W. Wevers, Motes on the Greek Text of Deuteronomy, Scholars Press, Adanta 1995, p. 19. 43 Cf. Philo, De sacrificiis, 101; Origen, In Mt. Com., X,14; XVII,17; In Jr. hom., XVIII, 6. 44 It is typical of Marcion to insist on the imperfect character of divine repentance, as shown in the Old Testament.</page><page sequence="10">144 SAMUEL FERNANDEZ EYZAGUIRRE When the Scripture reasons theologically about God himself and does not blend his economy with human realities, it is said that God is not like a man [.. .]. But when divine economy is blended with human realities, it assumes human intelligence (voi5), mood (rpO6to;) and language (XFE1).45 Origen pays great attention to the verb tponOyopho. He thinks translators from the Hebrew did not find the proper word, and invented this expres sion which he understands, etymologically, to mean to assume the mood of, in other words, adapt oneself 46 In this light, the Alexandrian proposes the following comparison: as a man who, when speaking to a child, adapts his language to make himself understood (and nobody who listens to him speak ing thus, thinks he has gone mad or forgotten his beard), so God also con descends and adopts our language when talking to men. The discourse of the Scripture is a language adapted to men. b. Contra Celsum IV,71-72. Celsus ridicules the biblical image of a God who experiences human passions. Reacting against this, Origen insists on the pedagogical character of biblical expressions and, alluding to divine pas sions which he calls anthropopatisms, states: &lt;The Logos speaks thus, assuming the manner of men (avOp6no- cpo6nou; . . .popov), for the benefit of men).4 The so called ire of God is not a passion but rather a pedagogical procedure.48 c. Commentaries on Matthew XVII,17-19. Apropos Mt 22,2, which literally says '7he Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man king', Origen tackles the ques tion of why the Scripture here compares God with a man. He uses Dt 1,31 and Nm 23,19 to maintain that the Scripture in some instances says that God is like a man (Dt 1,31), and in other, states that God is not like a man (Nm 23,19). According to Origen, the Scripture declares God like a man, when he leads men,49 and so in many parables God is compared with man. Warning us against simpliciores and heretics who, for different reasons, attribute pas sions to God, the Alexandrian states that the Scripture, when speaking 45 Injer. horn., XVIII,6 (GCS III, p. 158). 46 Cf.

Jn 10,34). Only then shall God allow himself to be seen such as He is (KaOd; ?a(Ytv, lJn 3,2). This development ends with an interesting reasoning: Now then, even having been created worthy to see God with our intelligence and our heart (PF_ireF1V TOV Oe6V U-9 V(ji icact Tf Kap5ia), we do not see him such as He is (ica0cs; ?artv), but such as He becames to us according to our econ omy (icaNO; tai -div ,uigwrpav oiicovojiiav jgilv yiverat). But in the end of reali ties, 'in the universal restoration of which he spoke through his saints and prophets for centuries', we shall see Him, not as we see Him now: that which [He] is not (o ouic iCotiv), but as He will then show himself: that which [e] is (o ioatv).52 The uncertainty of our present knowledge affects not only those with less instruction, but all of us. Even those who have been worthy to see God with the nou's have a limited knowledge which will only be full in the life to come. We here have a development of negative theology. In the current situation we know what God has become for us, on account of his economy. But this is not a problem concerning only God's language, it concerns the very being of God as well. Origen makes a difference on how God is in himself and how He appears to us due to his economy. And further on, in the same text, the Alexandrian remarks: ?&lt;As God, when managing men, is called man in parables, he perhaps, in a certain way, also becomes [a man]&gt;.53 The statement is cautious (taxa, io;), but clearly suggests that, for Origen, the problem does not lie exclusively in what is said about God (X'y7Eai) but, also, in what happens in God (yivetat), that is to say, in the very being of God.

How are we to solve this apparent contradiction? Faced by this problem, Origen tackles the issue of the biblical language con cerning God: The Scripture speaks anthropopathically about God, that is to say, it endows him with human passions. Origen insists on the pedagogical nature of these expressions: God adapts his language just as a man adapts his to that of a child (cf. Dt 1,31). When the Scripture endows God with passions, Origen insists on the need to understand these expressions metaphorically (tropice, humano more, -rponopOpEO, EpguiVe@W, napxoXoki). Nevertheless it must be remembered that metaphor, for Origen, is not void language but rather the only way by which God can communicate with men: &lt;&lt;it is impossible for man, who lives in the flesh, to know what is hidden and invisible f he does not conceive an image or resem blance based upon what is visible&gt;&gt;.54 The anthropomorphic language of the Scripture is not only a gift for the ruder and ignorant, it is the only way by which God can address man in his current condition. Even those who have known God with the nodis, only manage a partial knowledge during this life. But the analysed question is more than a mere matter of semantics: There is indeed a reality in God himself which is imperfectly expressed by means of metaphors, symbols, anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms. Consequently, Origen, though he metaphorically interprets God's passions as shown in the Scripture, thus supporting perfect divine apatheia, sea sons nevertheless his expressions on impassibiliy, declaring that 'God is not impassible'. 1. Regarding the passion of the Logos, Origen discovers a reality in the eternal Son of God which impels him to 'leave his home and go to those who are not able to come to Him'; a reality prior to incarnation, for it is its very cause. This reality, which is also called philanthropy and mercy, is what, in the homily of Ezekiel, is called 'passion'. This passion' belongs to the Logos in his pre-existence: 'if he had not suffered, he would not have come to share human lIfe'. The doctrine according to which Christ is passible in his human nature and impassible in his divine one, is unable to explain the reasons for incarna tion. There is a reality prior to incarnation, that affects the Logos in his pre existence, which allow us to qualify the Logos as passible. 54 ?Quia ergo impossibile est homini in carne viventi agnoscere aliquid de eoccultis' et invisibilibus, nisi imaginem aliquam et similitudinem conceperit de visibilibus? In Ct. Com., 111,13,17 (GCS VIII, p. 209).</page><page sequence="13">'PASSIO CARITATIS' ACCORDING TO ORIGEN 147 2. Concerning God the Father, Origen wishes to avoid two extremes: on the one hand, he wants to reject that God be like a man who rages, by stating that God is impassible; on the other hand, he wants to reject that God be like a man who lacks mercy, by stating that God is not impassible. And so 'God is not like a man' (Nm 23,19), and, at the same time, 'God is like a man' (Dt 1,31). Thus, in the works of the Alexandrian, God is proclaimed passible and impassible, without renouncing either qualification. The heart of the matter lies, obviously, on the subject of language about God. Based upon these statements, it can be said that neither the terms 'passible' nor 'impassible' can describe properly God's being. To describe God with our human language we are to inadequately declare that he is impassible and passible. We must, then, remember on this matter something that is usually forgotten: the statement that God is impassible is true, but it is not the whole truth. But Origen goes further and states that this adapted language has its foun dation in God's doing and being. There is a reality that provokes and fun daments the economy: something 'happens' in God (yv' atfi. That reality is called 'passion' by the Alexandrine. This shocking statement is best under stood in the light of the relation established by Origen between being and freedom.55 He admits that God, out of mercy, exercising his liberty, sur passes the limits imposed upon him by the greatness of his being, since, for the economy, God becomes what is incompatible with the magnitude of his nature: etfit in uis in quibus iuxta magnitudinem naturae suae non potest esse.
