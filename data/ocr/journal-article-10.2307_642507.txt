<plain_text><page sequence="1">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE1 By STEVEN H. LONSDALE Among the general questions that arise in analysing a culture's out- look on its fauna are the following: Where do animals belong in the world-view of that culture, in their cosmogony or historical mythology, and how do these aetiological beliefs reflect upon the economic position of animals? What is the range of emotional attitudes towards man's enigmatic and uncanny half-brothers, especially domesticated species? Are animals used in entertain- ment? Questions such as these may be further refined by deter- mining which species are domesticated, which hunted; which are eaten by man, which taboo; which animals does man sacrifice or worship? Are animals kept as pets, and if so, what kinds of names does a culture give them-human names or abstract names em- bodying a spiritual quality or force in nature? To what extent are these non-verbal creatures a substitute for affection or sadistic punishment, or a target for aggressive or hostile feelings? In other words, what qualities does man project onto animals? Or put slightly differently, which powers does he attribute to the animal? Is an animal thought capable of curing illness, for example? And finally, what are some of the recurrent symbols that emerge for a given animal in legend or myth? The fauna of ancient Greece do not vary appreciably from those of modern-day Greece, save for the notable depletion nowadays in numbers of two domesticated species, horses and large cattle, owing to lack of pasturage through over-grazing.2 Game is com- mon, and around the ubiquitous Greek coastline fish are plentiful. Among the wild species found in Greece are the 'European' animals, such as wildcat, marten, brown bear, roe deer, wolf, wild boar, and lynx. The jackal, wild goat, and porcupine are more typically Mediterranean species. A few species have become rare or extinct. These include the lion and agrimi, a variety of wild goat known from artistic representations and the Minoan Linear B tablets, which tally up the number of horns used in manufacturing the composite bow.3 Today the agrimi is a protected species con- fined to the area west of the Roumeli Gorge in the White Moun- tains of Crete. The lion, whose disputed existence in the Greek world is entangled in a lair of controversy, is absent. In historical times Herodotus (7.125-7) reports lions in northern Greece, and</page><page sequence="2">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE 147 Aristotle (H.A. 8.28), an inhabitant of this region, follows suit. The naturalistic portrayal of lions in Mycenaean art and the vivid descriptions of marauding lions in the Homeric similes offer com- pelling subjective evidence for their presence in the Aegean, The Greeks were a mixed planter and animal-breeder culture from the Early Bronze Age. Despite the undisputed physical beauty of Greece and its occasional fertile valleys, plains, and rivers, Greece has always been a poor country with a parching climate. Many regions are mountainous and landlocked, and virtually everywhere the soil is rocky. Vegetation can be sparse, especially in the Peloponnese. Given such conditions the inhabit- ants managed to produce grain at a subsistence level and to breed, by process of selection, resilient strains of cattle. The wealthy landowner could afford to raise horses and horned cattle, the peasant small cattle (sheep, goats, pigs) only. Poultry-breeding was common throughout Greece. In Hellenistic times it proved profitable, and sometimes necessary, to sow the earth in order to supplement pasturage. Realistically, from the point of view of the peasant, the soil could sustain small cattle more readily than cows.4 This is not to say that large cattle were absent. The largest island off the coast of Attica, Euboia, means 'rich in cattle', and the many sacrificial cattle in the great procession on the Parthenon frieze indicate that cattle could be spared for sacrifice. But it may be assumed that, since pasturage was at a premium, large cattle were scarcer and commensurately more valuable than small cattle. Because of their value oxen were at the basis of important econ- omic and social practices. Before the introduction of coinage in the Greek world cattle were a measuring-stick of wealth. In the funeral games of Patrolkdos in the Iliad, the victor of the wrestling- match is accorded a tripod, we are told, worth twelve oxen, and the runner-up a female slave worth four oxen (II. 23.700-5). This form of primitive money is paralleled in many cultures.5 Cattle were exchanged in the social institution of dowry. The dowry in ancient Greece may not have been a one-way exchange but a more or less mutual trade between bride and groom's family.6 Like the name for the island of Euboia, girls were given cow-names, so it would appear, to encourage prospective husbands. 'Euboia' itself is found, as well as names like 'Phereboia' ('bringing in many cows'), 'Polyboia' ('worth much cattle'), or 'Stheneboia', ('strong in cows').7 There is no indication that cows were used for dairy-products in Greece: the goatinstead was the milk-supplier. The meat, however, was eaten. But the majority of the population, which lived in the</page><page sequence="3">148 ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE countryside tilling the fields, existed on a primarily vegetarian diet. They did not dislike meat; it was scarce and expensive, served up to the landowner or saved for feasts. Pronounced meat-eating habits are associated with religious cults. At one extreme worshippers in the Orphic cults from archaic times adhered to a strict vegetarian diet which prescribed keeping to inanimate food and abstaining totally from things animate (P1. Leg. 782 C). At the other, the ritual eating of raw ox flesh, cpobayla, was the culminating act of the Dionysiac winter dance. There is evidence for the belief that Dionysos appeared as a bull, including a fragment of one of the carmina popularia from Elis which invoked the deity as a bull (Poet. Mel. Graec. Pop. 871b). The exhausted female worshippers subjected themselves to a finale which was at once exalting and repulsive: they tore apart a live bull and ingested the inward parts in order to become one with the god. In the heat of this emotional conflict, they believed that they were incorporating the godhead, the logic being, accord- ing to the principle of homeopathic magic, that if you want to be like the god you must eat the god.8 The scene that Greek literature and myth reflect is one of expansive and bustling pastoralism. The Homeric poems give the impression that large quantities of oxen were about, to be plun- dered by the enterprising hero. But within the framework of an epic poem this picture probably amounts to a glamorization of the actual circumstances, just as the hero is a magnification of an ordinary mortal. Hesiod, composing across the Aegean at a time roughly contemporary with Homer, perhaps gives a fairer likeness. He advises the farmer in the Works and Days to establish himself before winter sets in saying, 'First of all, get a house, and a woman, and an ox for the plough' (Op. 405 f.). Epithets for regions and individuals, such as 'rich in flocks', and the memorable bucolic characters throughout Greek legend indicate that the Greeks liked to see one faqade of their national identity in terms of animal husbandry. In epic and lyric poetry an epithet often accorded to the earth is simply 'mother of the flocks'. Greek myths' and legends are so permeated by pastoralism as to convey the impression that virtually everybody, including gods, heroes, thieves, beggars, and even monsters put in his time as a shepherd. The most uncivilized of monsters, the man-eating, one-eyed Cyclops Polyphemos is cast in the Odyssey as a shepherd dutifully herding, counting, and milking his sheep and goats. The morning after Odysseus has got him drunk and blinded him, the monster stands at the entrance to his cave. He is suffering bitter pain. In</page><page sequence="4">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE 149 plaintive tones he addresses the lead ram (under whose belly Odysseus is guilefully concealed) and looks for a friend in him: My dear old ram, why are you thus leaving the cave last of the sheep? ... Perhaps you are grieving for your master's eye, which a bad man with his wicked companions put out, this Nobody, who I think has not yet got clear of destruction. If only you could think like us and be given a voice ... (Od. 9.447-57) This passage points to an important positive aspect of the man- animal relationship: reciprocity. The shepherd and his flock live in a kind of symbiotic state just beyond the fringes of civilization. The shepherd provides protection for his flocks, and they in turn are a source of comfort, even joy, for the lone herdsman. The appearance on all levels of Greek myth and literature of the shepherd and his flock suggests how deeply ingrained this mutual tie had become in the Greek consciousness. The sense of reciprocity applies also to the dog, which was never far removed from the herdsman. The dog served as a faithful com- panion to ward off the cattle-robbers and scavengers, cats and the wild dogs, which preyed on a man's possessions and peace of mind. A short digression on the dog may serve to suggest the range of associations and attitudes possible towards an individual species. As indicated, dogs were helpful creatures. The mastiff-like Molossian from Epirus served as sheep-dog, and certain breeds of hounds, notably the bitches of the Laconian strain, were highly prized for their acute hunting ability. The dog's keen sense of smell and hearing made him invaluable as a watch-dog. Hesiod warns the farmer not to neglect the sharp-toothed hound: 'Look after your sharp-fanged hound, and don't grudge him his food, or some day the Day-sleeper may rob you of your belongings' (Op. 604 f.). Maria Leach, author of a comprehensive book on the dog in mythology and religion, asserts, 'the position of the dog can be ascertained by the names bestowed upon him. Dogs who serve a community merely as scavengers are seldom, if ever, named.'10 It is interesting to observe that while the Greek named dogs, they did not give human names either to hunting dogs or to pet dogs. Four hundred dog-names have survived from antiquity. Some of them are from the Cynegeticus (7.5) of Xenophon, who provides the huntsman with a list of possible names for hounds. Short, two- syllable names facilitate the hunter in calling his hounds. As ex- amples he gives 'Psyche' (soul), 'Chara' (joy), 'Hybris', 'Methepon' (helper), 'Lailaps' (whirlwind). These names, which may be taken as representative of Greek dog-names, indicate something of the</page><page sequence="5">150 ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE assumptions underlying the kinship between man and animal. The dog was regarded not as a creature possessing a complete, quasi- human personality but as exemplifying some generalized quality or spiritual force. The intelligence of dogs was acknowledged. Plato, in the Republic (375 E-3 76), discusses the qualities of the guardian of the state and holds up the dog as an exemplar. According to him, the dog is comparable to a true lover of wisdom since he can distinguish between an unknown person and an acquaintance. Also in the Republic, as in other dialogues, Plato makes Socrates swear by the dog, the so-called Rhadamanthine oath (Resp. 376, Phdr. 228 B, Grg. 461 A, 466 C, 482 B). The dog was a magical creature with therapeutic functions. In the cult of Asklepios dogs were sometimes an integral part of the cure. They licked invalids back to health, and it was a sure sign of imminent recovery if a patient dreamed about a dog (IG 4.951, 952; Ael. N.A. 8.9). The Greeks kept dogs as pets, whereas cats are mostly absent from the record until Hellenistic times. The table-dog appears from Homer onward. Vase-painting, sculpture, and, most emphat- ically, eulogies to beloved pets in the Greek Anthology indicate how cherished a companion the dog became. Dogs were buried in cemeteries alongside humans." Plutarch, a late source, tells the story of Alcibiades, who deferred excessive curiosity and attention to himself by appearing in public with a magnificent hound whose tail he had lopped off (Plut. Alc. 9). The favourable disposition towards the dog in ancient Greece stands in contrast to the mistrust for the dog in the Near East. The strong dislike can be explained mainly on hygienic grounds: dogs in the Near East are scavengers and hence pestiferous vermin. They became a byword for intemperate sexual activities. Dogs did not provide useful services to the Jews on the same scale as to the Greeks. Although a passage from Job (30:1) grudgingly admits the presence of sheep-dogs, it is not at all certain that dogs were used in the chase. But the scavenger, frequently conjured up as a threat by Sophocles and Homer, was also a real feature of the Greek land- scape. This can be deduced from Thucydides' vivid description of the plague at Athens, where the dogs and birds are said to have learned to avoid the plague-ridden corpses of the dead lying about (2.50). Ironically, the domestication of the dog may have developed out of the realization that dogs living near areas of human habita- tion could provide useful scavenging services. The origins of man's relationship with the dog may thus have a symbiotic basis, and this</page><page sequence="6">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE 151 may incidentally help to explain the deep emotional impulse between the two creatures. Diseased and rabid dogs also aroused the Greeks' anxiety. Aristotle mentions three kinds of rabies, only two of them fatal to man." Euripides several times refers to Lyssa, the personifica- tion of martial rage derived from the same root as the Greek for 'wolf' and also meaning 'rabies'. The approach inherent in the dog's uncleanliness is extended to apply to the animal's supposedly licentious sexual practices, which could be observed taking place close to man's living quarters. By the time of Aristophanes, at least, izkov had acquired the meaning 'prostitute' (Wasps 1402). The dog in mythology and art was a favourite image for expres- sing a monster. Underworld dogs made difficult pets. Kerberos cannot be named but is allusively mentioned in Homer as the 'baneful dog of Hades'. In the Theogony (309-12) he is unspeak- ably horrid; Hesiod nevertheless calls him by name and describes him as a fifty-headed, brazen-voiced, flesh-eater. Hekate travels in the company of her hell-hounds. These underworld dogs possibly reflect actual experiences of travellers meeting face to face with inimical watch-dogs, as when Odysseus, returning in the guise of a beggar, meets Eumaios and his watchful dogs in book fourteen of the Odyssey. The dog is not far removed from his wild cousins, the wolf and jackal. Certain breeds of dogs were believed to contain wild blood. The Laconian hound had no less than seven alleged sires: lion, tiger, civet, cat, fox, jackal, and wolf. The Greeks never missed a chance to tell a good story, and the following excerpt from the Historia Animalium (574a) furthermore shows the Greeks' interest in exotic species, stimulated by specimens which Alexander the Great had his men bring back from campaigns in the East. In dis- cussing dogs Aristotle mentions a rare breed of hunting dog in India which the owner would tie up to a tree in the hope that a tiger would mate with the bitch-provided, as he drily adds, that the tiger did not eat her up. The tendency to adopt savage animals as parents to various breeds of dogs not only indicates a desire to attach a fiercer pedigree to one's hounds that they may seem worthier in the hunt, but also expresses an attempt to explain the wildness observable in that species which lives closest to man. This outline of attitudes towards dogs indicates something of the ambivalent feelings that can be aroused for an individual species. Dogs are seen to be utilitarian creatures, working with man. Pet dogs are held in affection, and at death certain dogs were buried and eulogized in a manner not unlike that which their</page><page sequence="7">152 ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE masters might expect for themselves. But they are conceived as independent entities incorporating, as their names suggest, some abstract force. Avoidance, mistrust, awe, and fear are further emotions associated with dogs. In time of war or conflict the dog becomes a scavenger. The fear that the dog will turn on his master, in essence become his successor, comes through strongly in stories like Priam's apocalyptic vision of the fall of Troy in the twenty- second book of the Iliad, where his table-dogs tear out his hair and rip away his genitals. The dog is also made out to be what it is not. In a moral sense the dog is turned into a shameful reproach for sexual intemperance. In a healing cult the dog is held in awe, because he is believed to possess magical therapeutic powers. The ambivalence felt for animals stems from the recognition that animals possess qualities, especially the power of non-verbal communication, which humans do not; these may arouse hostility and envy in man. The animal may simply enjoy greater speed, agility, or muscular power, or a keen scent in the chase; or the animal may be thought capable of controlling the fertility of the crops and flocks, or to hold the key to conversation with the im- mortal gods. The Greeks had a tendency to interpret events and phenomena as divine signs. A sneeze, the rustling of oak leaves, or the cry of the heron might have a supernatural import. They communicated with their gods through animal sacrifices and interpreted divine will through bird omens. The belief that the Olympians inhaled the smoke of burnt sacrifices offered by mortals is parodied by Aristophanes in the Birds. Pisthetaerus, one of the two disgruntled Athenian citizens off to find utopia, consults a hoopoe-bird. He finds none of his suggestions very good, but Pisthetaerus himself is suddenly seized by the ingenious idea that the birds found a city in mid-air and starve the gods by blocking the smoke from human sacrifices. On a more serious note, the Greeks had a professional class of seers, olcwv6roXot, who studied the movement and behaviour of birds, and thereby predicted events or interpreted supernatural decisions. Prometheus, in Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, describes how he taught man the subtleties of this craft: 'It was I who set in order the omens of the highways and the flight of crooked-talcned birds, which-of them were propitious or lucky by nature, and what manner of life each led, and what were their mutual hates, loves, and companionships' (P. V. 488-92). A fascinating historical docu- ment from Ephesus in the sixth century B.c. indicates that there was an attempt to codify the laws of augury. The fragmentary</page><page sequence="8">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS INANCIENT GREECE 153 inscription can be restored to read as follows: Line of flight from right to left. If the bird disappeared from sight, the omen is favourable; but if it raised its left wing and then soared and disappeared, the omen is inauspicious. Line of flight from left to right. If it disappeared on a straight course, it is an ill omen, but if it raised its right wing and then soared and disappeared, the omen is good. (SIG3 1167) Fear and hostility are prominent feelings projected onto animals. Animals have the power to make men feel guilty. Walter Burkert, author of an important work on sacrifice in ancient Greece, Homo Necans,'3 interprets the discovery of reindeer bones stripped bare and.meticulously replaced in the original shape of the beast by Paleolithic hunters as evidence of man's desire to avoid the aveng- ing spirit of the hunted animal. In ancient Greece the sacrifice of an ox was like killing a brother. According to the primitive legal system of archaic Athens, the various participants of the bouphonia, the murder of an ox with an axe, were tried and found innocent, while the axe was deemed the guilty agent.14 An attractive explanation for the origin of the use of masks in Athenian tragedy, a word literally meaning 'goat- song', is that the dramatic ritual involved the sacrifice of a goat; and the sacrificer, in order to avoid being recognized by the animal, disguised himself behind a mask. The hunt is an area where man asserts power over the animal through technical superiority. Hunting in Bronze Age and classical Greece was not so much a necessary activity as a pursuit of adven- ture and an educational experience."s A spirit of sportsmanship prevails in the hunt as described in epic poetry; hunting is, after all, the off-duty pursuit par excellence of the warrior. The hero hunts not only wild animals but domesticated species when he goes cattle-rieving or horse-thieving. But the sense of challenge that emerges, for example, in the Odyssey description of Odysseus hunting his first wild boar on the slopes of Mt. Parnassos (a kind of rite de passage that ensures his readiness for war) contrasts sharply with the deceitful and exploitative nature of the hunt in later Greece and Rome. Plato, in the Laws (822 D-824 C), approves those forms of hunting which demand skill and effort on the part of the pursuer, but condemns cruel, lazy, and deceitful methods. In keeping with the Greeks' love of competition the hunt should ideally be a more or less fair contest. Plato rules out hunting by nets and traps, and especially night-stalking, where men sleep in rotation while the wakeful member of the expedition watches to see if an unsuspect-</page><page sequence="9">154 ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE ing victim has fallen into a pit. Fishing by hand is permissible, but creeling and angling'6 should be forbidden. Most reprehensible of all is the use of 'muddying waters', vegetable dyes which cloud the water and paralyse the fish. In the only acceptable form of hunting, the athletic young hunter pursues land mammals on foot with his dogs, and overcomes his prey by running, striking, and shooting. There is little sign of respect or compassion for the hunted animal in Xenophon or in other ancient treatises on the hunt. In the Cynegeticus Xenophon describes in great detail how to dig pits and place nets for deer, hare, and even wild boar. Once the animal has fallen into the trap it is clubbed to death. An alterna- tive method of hunting roe deer uses the captured fawn as a decoy. With it the hunter lures the bereft mother into a clearing and unleashes his hounds on her. Attitudes become increasingly callous, culminating in Roman times in the massive slaughter of animals by professional hunters in the Circus Maximus. Aristophanes' parody in the Birds of the uncanny powers of animals mentioned above is indicative of the humorous possibil- ities animals represented in entertainment. The Greeks' love of a good story and the narrative importance of animals in myth is translated into action in the dramatic festivals of the archaic and classical period. Amidst the murky origins of Athenian fifth- century drama lie lyric contests and animal masquerades. Aris- totle (Poet. 3-5) traces the origins of tragedy to the dithyramb, a lyric contest in honour of Dionysos, and performed by choruses of men displaying the physical characteristics of goats. Indeed the light-hearted play which provided relief from the trilogy of trag- edies at the Festival of Dionysos was known as the satyr-play. Goat- and horse-men wearing giant phalloi re-enacted, or perhaps it is fairer to say, distorted ancient legends in a wholly grotesque and hilarious manner. As part of the merrymaking in the Kiccoo,17 a processional mime involving an agon between revellers and on- lookers, some of the participants dressed up and impersonated animals. In Old Comedy it may be assumed that plays such as the Birds, Wasps, and Frogs of Aristophanes made the most of the dramatic possibilities of choruses of men hopping about the stage in animal guise."1 Comedy incorporated the talking animals from folk-lore and fantastical legends about the escapades of the super- naturals in every manifestation, including animal metamorphoses. The fascination with bestiality known from Greek myths, such as the seduction of Leda by Zeus in the form of a swan, seems to have been gratified on stage. Hans Licht makes a very convincing case for the enactment of intercourse between animals and men before spectators in Hellenistic Greece."9</page><page sequence="10">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE 155 Animals are important in Greek games and contests. The chariot- race was the first and foremost event in the funeral games of Patroklos in the Iliad, and it continued to enjoy this prominent position in the pan-Hellenic games. The keeping of horses became something of a preoccupation among aristocratic circles in Athens, and Strepsiades, in Aristophanes' Clouds, is driven bankrupt by the vast sums of money his son Pheidippides squanders on upkeep. The Athenians also took great relish in cock-fighting. Bred for this purpose, these fierce birds battled it out on raised tables smeared with garlic to resuscitate a maimed and fallen contender. A statue base dating from c. 500 found in the Athenian agora shows two ageing men urging a cat and dog in a fight.20 Animals do not play the same role in entertainment as in the Roman circuses, although isolated references, such as the ape in Pindar's Second Pythian (72 f.), may allude to animal performers in children's shows.2' In summary man's relationship with animals in ancient Greece is neither simply one of superiority or submission. By virtue of his reason and technical accomplishment man harnesses the energy of the domesticated animal and makes it work for him. Between the shepherd and his flock, hunter and dog, there is a sense of reciprocity. The animal is a source of humour and entertainment, and men dress up in animal masquerades in festivals and cults at least in part because 'the child in mankind dies hard'.22 In the hunt man asserts his skill and superiority by tracking down and killing dangerous prey. In turn the intrinsic power of the hunted victim, especially the wild boar, may be thought to reside in a helmet or hide made from the animal and which the hunter there- after wears. The pursuit lends prestige to a man and assures him of the right to fight. In sacrifice and omens the animal possesses powers inaccessible to man: the animal is therefore an indispens- able medium of communication with the immortal gods. There is an element of agon between man and animal. The two are involved in a volatile master-slave relationship, as the Greek cosmogony shows. The assumption in many cultures that animals once possessed the earth plays no part in the Greeks' creation story." But monsters appear early on in the Greek creation myth as told in the Theogony (137-53; 617 ff.). The first animate creatures that Earth bears to Ouranos are Kronos, the one-eyed Cyclopes, and a fearsome trio of monsters, Kottos, Gyes, and Obriareus, each with fifty heads and a hundred arms. Kronos castrates Ouranos with a sickle fashioned by loving Earth; and Zeus, the son of Kronos and Rhea, in turn overthrows his father. The monsters are tucked out of sight in Tartarus along with the</page><page sequence="11">156 ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE three-headed dog Kerberos. We are told that they are chained in cruel bonds out of jealousy for their strength. But when Zeus and the other Olympian gods find themselves contending with the terrible race of Titan gods, Zeus resorts to unleashing the monsters, and they become his chief allies. The monsters originally can be seen as wild species. Their banishment is an attempt to free the civilized upper world from unruly influences. Once Zeus is made aware of their indispensable powers, he harnesses their energies for the Titanomachy; he domesticates them, in effect. Later they rejoin Kerberos, now enjoying the status of guardians. The relative lack of animals in the creation story is in keeping with the Greek anthropocentric world-view. The Greeks naturally distinguished between men and animals, and yet it is interesting to observe that there is no generic word for animals until rod 6 ov comes into use in the fifth century B.C. (Hdt. 5.1). There is an important passage from early Greek literature which points out a fundamental difference between animals and men. In the Works and Days Hesiod addresses his brother, a landowner: ... Perses, hear me out on justice, and take what I have to say to heart; cease thinking of violence. For the son of Kronos, Zeus, has ordained this law to men: that fishes and wild beasts and winged birds should devour one another, since there is no justice in them; but to mankind he gave justice which proves for the best. (Op. 274-80) Here the fundamental distinction is an ethical one. Stated in its most basic terms, the law of Justice restrains man from preying on his own kind. Later in the fourth century Xenophon distinguished man from animal by virtue of man's ability to speak and reason, and his sense of religious awe. (Ap. 12; Mem. 1.1.3-5, 3.3, 11 f.) This strong tendency to distinguish between man and animal carries over, to an extent, in myth and ritual. G. S. Kirk states '... there is no real confusion in the Greek mythical world between men and animals as such.' And later, The Greeks' anthropomorphism was severe. They missed something thereby, I believe, but the reason for it may be obvious: they no longer lived in a world dominated by animals, by the need to hunt and trap them and keep them at bay, in the way that many simple tribal communities did and do.24 Is this a complete explanation of the anthropocentric Greek world-view? The propensity to regard man and animal in a separate light is to a large extent a valid observation, especially if one con- trasts Greece and Egypt. The Greeks lack the somewhat bleary line-up of countless theriomorphic deities, the millions of mummi- fied cats-the very creatures which lived with them; nor did the</page><page sequence="12">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE 157 Greeks inhume cattle bones and later send around a ship to collect them for reburial in a special locale. An animal fetish dominated the Egyptians down to Hellenistic times; but from a practical point of view animals dominated the Egyptians, who depended heavily on cereal products, no more than they did the Greeks. By chance we have evidence of the Greeks' impressions of Egyptian attitudes and practices involving animals recorded by Herodotus.25 Herodotus delivered his History as a series of lectures in the market-place at Athens and elsewhere, and is generally taken to be a fair and unbiased reporter. What emerges in the tone of his report on the Egyptians, however, is a certain prejudice, and over- reaction to outlandish Egyptian practices, as if the Greeks were unaware or unwilling to admit their own irrational attitudes towards animals. No doubt the Greeks were staid by comparison with the Egyptians, but archaeology has revealed a number of to us rather incomprehensible animal cults. The best known of these took-place at Brauron, just 15 miles from Athens at the height of the Golden Age of Perikles. There, every four or five years, little girls from five to ten years of age living in a sort of convent dressed up in saffron robes to impersonate bears and dance offer- ings to the goddess Artemis, who demanded their service (so the aetiological explanation goes) in reparation for killing one of her sacred bears.26 Greek mythology did have its difficult pets in addition to Kottos and his friends: monsters such as barking Skylla and belching Charybdis, hybrids like the chimaira and sphinx, or hungry demons -Lamia, who fed on children's flesh; put slightly differently, the sorceress Circe turned her lovers into castrated, domesticated lions or wolves who fawned and wagged their tails. The tendency to banish monsters like Kottos, Gyes, and Obriareus to the under- world-imprison them, so to speak, in the lower regions of man's mind-indicates both a fascination and an avoidance of the frighten- ing and unknown. Such was the fate of the last and most fearful of monsters in the creation story, Typhon, who, according to later legend, was buried under the volcanic Mount Aetna (Pind. 01. 4.8 f.). Clearly the demonic element of the animal was deeply impreg- nated in the Greek imagination and occasionally it erupted and fired the artist or poet to creative heights, as in Hesiod's description of the very creature in question: But when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, huge Earth bare her youngest child, Typhon of the love of Tartarus, by the aid of golden Aphrodite. From his shoulders grew a hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes</page><page sequence="13">158 ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE in his marvellous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared. And there were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of sound unspeakable; for at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud, ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of heart; and at another, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again, at another, he would hiss so that the high mountains re-echoed ... But Zeus raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and the lurid thunderbolt; he leaped from Olympos and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster ... Typhon was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned ... And flame shot forth from the thunder-struck lord in the dim, rugged glens of the mount when he was smitten. (Tb. 819 ff.) NOTES 1. Among the primary literary sources Aristotle and Aelian are authors who wrote works pertaining wholly to animals. Aristotle's extensive scientific writing on animals includes the Historia Animalium, De Partibus Animalium, De Motu Animalium, sections of the Parva Naturalia, and De Generatione Animalium. For a summary of these works, see G. Lloyd, 'The development of Aristotle's theory of the classification of animals', Phronesis 6 (1961), 59-81. Aelian, by contrast, is an arm-chair zoologist. A Roman historian and teacher of rhetoric writing in Greek in the second century A.D., he com- piled a voluminous work entitled De Natura Animalium. His account is full of tales, proverbs, and popular cures involving animals taken from medical handbooks. Xeno- phon, a fourth-century B.C. Athenian aristocrat, wrote two pedagogical treatises con- cerning animals: a member of the cavalry and an expert horseman, Xenophon wrote On Horsemanship for the education of his sons; the Cynegeticus is a treatise on hunting hare, as well as deer and wild boar. Xenophon stresses the educational value of the hunt for breeding a noble character and preparing a man for war. RE contains no general article on 'Tier' per se but does include entries under individ- ual species. A long article entitled 'Tierdiiamonen' rightly emphasizes the 'demonic' element of the animal in religion, magic, and superstition. On a much smaller scale the OCD' contains a short entry by H. J. Rose on 'Sacred Animals'. In one paragraph Rose presents evidence for what some suspect to be residual totemism, but strongly rejects the possibility of this phenomenon having existed in Greece. Rose refers the reader to Nilsson, GGR3, pp. 212 ff., who speaks of a totemistic void in Greek religion. In the light of subsequent clarification from both anthropology and archaeology this statement seems too strongly negative. A. B. Cook's 'Animal worship in the Mycenaean age', JHS 14 (1894), 81-169, is overstated in the opposite direction, but nevertheless con- tains some insightful hypotheses on the religious function of demons in Mycenaean- Minoan art. For the role of the animals in Greek intellectual history see F. M. Heichelheim and T. Elliot, 'Das Tier in Vorstellungswelt der Griechen', StudGen 20 (1967), 85-9; cf. H. Rahn 'Tier und mensche in der homerischen Auffassung der Wirklichkeit', Paideuma 5 (1950-54), 277-97, 432-80; Urs Dierauer, Tier undMenscb im Denken der Antike, Studien zur antiken Philosophie Bd. 6 (Amsterdam, 1977). Among the encyclopedias and specialized lexica on Greek fauna are the following: O. Keller, Die antike Tierwelt (Leipzig, 1909-13; reprinted 1963). This two-volume encyclopedia (unfortunately not up-dated before reprinting) is useful because it dis- cusses the literature and monuments-relating to individual species in a comparative way in Biblical, Near Eastern, Greek, and Roman cultures. For a survey of species in the Greek world, see O. K6rner, Die homerische Tierwelt' (Munich, 1930). Two classifica- tory works, both labours of love by the naturalist Sir D'Arcy Thompson, are A Glossary of Greek Birds' (Oxford, 1936) and A Glossary of Greek Fisbes (Oxford, 1947).</page><page sequence="14">ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS IN ANCIENT GREECE 159 J.
