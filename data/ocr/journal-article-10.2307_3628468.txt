<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY VOLUME 4 * NUMBER 1 SPRING * 1948 NOTES ON CULTURAL INNOVATIONS IN DYNASTIC EGYPT WALTER CLINE HE CIVILIZATION that began with the invention of hieroglyphs and ended with the adoption of Greek has been displayed to modern readers as a jumble of anachronisms. Egyptologists, who have set the clock for archaeology around the Mediterranean, present their own panoramas with a bewildering indif- ference to time. They can tell the exact years when a pharaoh reigned, a statue was hewn, or a temple built, but they fail to relate these monumental events to contemporary changes in Egyptian life. Erman and Ranke's Aegypten, the fullest and most authentic survey yet published, is arranged topically rather than histor- ically, as if people who lived centuries apart belonged to a single community. This and other general works, for example, frequently cite the Ebers Papyrus on medicine without informing us when this document was written, and introduce the Osiris cult, which began before the Pyramids, by a myth from Plutarch three thousand years later. The current fallacy that Egyptian civilization was em- balmed in some dynasty or other and thereafter suffered only decay is thus upheld by the very writers who are best prepared to refute it. This time-scrambled view may satisfy a casual reader who wishes only to compare the total attain- ments of the Egyptians with those of other peoples. It does not disturb the Egyptologist, for he knows too much to be deceived and is too absorbed in details to seek a larger perspective. But the student of cultural history cannot digest Aegypten until he has reassembled all the data in chronological order and related them organically to each other. In doing this he destroys the illusion of immuta- bility but erects nothing to take its place, for the traits assigned to any one period are too fragmentary for an integrated picture and many of the others are undated. Competent scholars should write a series of monographs, each describing as</page><page sequence="2">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY fully as possible the civilization as it existed in a short span of time. Several of these descriptions might be drawn of various phases of the Old Kingdom (3200- 2500 BC), another of the Twelfth Dynasty (2000-1788), others of the middle and end of the Eighteenth Dynasty (1580-1350), the Twentieth (1200-1090), the Twenty-first (1090-945) and the Twenty-sixth (663-525). The intervening periods are perhaps too sparsely documented for such a synthesis. None of the portrayals would be as true to life as an ethnographer's report on a tribe he has observed in the field, for each one would be drawn haphazardly from several gen- erations and many localities, and would be loaded in favor of the social classes which advertized themselves in tombs, temples, and inscriptions; but if the writers were careful to remain within strict chronological limits and to include all details of life, however trivial, they would give us a more realistic picture of the Egyp- tians than has yet been presented. In the absence of such monographs, no layman can write a sketch of Dynastic culture or a synopsis of its history. The following notes on cultural gains and losses, arranged in historical order, have therefore only a suggestive value. Some of them represent well-authenticated changes, on whose approximate dates most Egyptologists agree. A large proportion, however, should be labelled tentatively as "first known occurrences," leaving the date of origin subject to change in the light of further information. If I have ignored social organization, made only a few hit or miss observa- tions on household economy, and given undue attention to the official cults, it is because such misproportions are inherent in the material published by Egyptolo- gists. To some extent they may have been inherent in Egyptian civilization. Negative evidence suggests that apart from the official hierarchy the social struc- ture gave little prominence to kinship and inheritance, and that the esthetic and religious activities of the common people were patterned after those of their rulers. To counteract the widespread impression that the Egyptians devoted most of their energies to funerals, sculpture, and temple-building, I have said little about monumental architecture and mortuary practices and given more space to everyday arts and crafts. I could not refrain from interweaving a few conjectures on the causes of cultural change, for these should be the ultimate objective in our research. If historians wish to correct me, I hope that they will do so in print. I have not attempted to write an outline of ancient Egyptian civilization but only to present in chronological order the features whose approximate beginning or ending dates could be ascertained. The others have been omitted, no matter how important they were. 2</page><page sequence="3">DYNASTIC EGYPT I have obtained most of my data from the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Erman and Ranke's Aegypten, A. Lucas' Ancient Egyptian Materials, Tech- niques, and Industries, and the publications of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Egyptian Exploration Fund. THE PREDYNASTIC HERITAGE The Egyptians who built and inscribed the first royal monuments, shortly before 3200 BC, inherited all the essentials of daily life from their prehistoric forefathers in the Nile Valley and Delta. They wrote their inscriptions in the native Hamitic language, in which the Semitic elements-if we are to regard them as originally foreign-had been so modified and assimilated that a long time must have elapsed since their intrusion. The Asiatic features appearing sporadically on the threshold of the Dynastic period-cylinder seals, pear-shaped stone maces, carved vases, tubular stands for pottery, recessed brick panels, dogs and lions depicted in Mesopotamian style, and so on-show only that the Egyp- tians were not completely unaffected by their eastern neighbors, and provide no stronger argument for the oriental origin of the civilization than does our own Chinese bric-a-brac. Popular life was altered very little by the political union and the beginning of writing and stone architecture which inaugurate the Dynastic age. Both before and after these innovations the Egyptians lived in rectangular houses of moulded, sun-dried brick, wore wigs and white linen garments, decorated their eyes with malachite or galena, and anointed themselves habitually with various oils and unguents. They wore beads of ostrich egg shell, steatite, carnelian, and amethyst. Boys and young men braided their hair in a heavy lock at one side of the head; and men, on some occasions, wore a kilt with an animal tail hanging behind. The people of the early historic period, like those of the late prehistoric, cul- tivated their staple crops of barley, emmer wheat, and flax with a long-bladed wooden hoe bound to a relatively short handle, and harvested them with a wooden sickle set with serrated chips of flint. They ground their grain to flour on a flat stone and brewed beer from emmer. They raised cattle, goats, swine, and hairy sheep. They paddled the Nile in small boats made of bundles of papyrus and in larger wooden vessels with decks, keels, and cabins, steered by one or more long oars at the stern. They mined copper and turquoise in Sinai, cast their copper tools and weapons in flat, open moulds, and smelted lead from galena. They imported gold from Nubia, shells from the Red Sea, and a great variety of materials from western Asia, such as coniferous woods, resin, silver, obsidian, and lapis lazuli. Their pottery, produced in large quantities on a</page><page sequence="4">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY commercial basis, shows little change between Predynastic and early Dynastic times. More decorative vessels were ground out of alabaster and harder rocks. Basketry was made from dom palm and date palm leaves by coiling a bundle of fibers and sewing the coils together. As a wood-working tool the Egyptians used the adze more than the axe, and did their pounding with round stones held directly in the hand, or with club-shaped mallets, rather than with hafted ham- mers. From sand and natron they made glaze to use as faience on a friable core, less often by itself to imitate turquoise. When a stiff, light material was required for ornamental purposes, they covered linen with stucco to make cartonnage. They used spoons and copper tweezers, and played some sort of game on a checker- board. The bow and arrow was their typical weapon. Their arrows were tipped with hard wood or chipped flint and often had a transverse, chisel-like edge instead of a point. They also fought with the sling, a copper axe with a long narrow edge inserted into the haft by three tangs, a mace with a pear-shaped stone head, and a straight copper dagger with or without a midrib, set into a hilt with curving projections enclosing the top of the blade. They hunted big game with the lasso, small game with a flat throwing-club, the striking end of which formed an obtuse angle with the shaft. They fished with nets, harpoons and barbless hooks. They buried their dead in a flexed posture and deposited food and personal articles in the grave, often in a compartment separate from the body. Certain animals, especially cattle, were sometimes buried with as much formality as people. Many supernatural powers were symbolized by animals and birds; the falcon stood for divinity, and most amulets were theriomorphic. Though there is no evidence for a tribal or clan organization, the country was divided into about forty administrative districts, each of which had an emblem of its own. CULTURES OF DYNASTIC EGYPT 3400-2980 BC DYNASTIES I AND II 420 YEARS On such humble foundations the rulers of Egypt, in the five centuries pre- ceding 3000 BC, superimposed a new complex of art, architecture, ritual, and theology. This had not evolved spontaneously from popular traditions. The governing class designed it as propaganda for the monarchy by selecting and reintegrating many old native themes, inventing a few new ones, and perhaps adapting certain foreign ideas to Egyptian patterns. Nevertheless, the monarchy itself was the result of an economic evolution predetermined by human geog- raphy. Twenty centuries of agriculture had crowded the narrow floodlands of the Nile with sedentary, hard-working people and had made it necessary for them to organize their irrigation projects and their systems of land tenure on an in- 4</page><page sequence="5">DYNASTIC EGYPT creasingly larger scale. The union of Upper and Lower Egypt under a single king was more than a political or military achievement; it mobilized all the re- sources of the country under one administration. Like most new totalitarian systems, it bolstered itself psychologically with a new combination of slogans, symbols, and rituals. The character that distinguished most strikingly the new culture from the old was the emphasis on symbolic representation. This was manifested in hiero- glyphic writing, in a style of graphic art closely related to hieroglyphic forms, in a pantheon of divine figures, in the architecture of temples and royal tombs, and in a round of ceremonials supporting the divine right of kingship. Hieroglyphic writing developed from the crude pictographs current in late Predynastic times. These pictographs, however, account for only a small pro- portion of the written symbols which came into use in the first two dynasties. Most hieroglyphs were ideograms with fixed verbal meanings; others, originally ideographic, could be used not only to represent complete words but also the phonetic components of words. The combined use of ideograms and phono- grams paralleled the contemporary Sumerian writing so closely that Asiatic influence can scarcely be doubted, but the symbols themselves were purely Egyp- tian. The transcription was still extremely concise, usually leaving particles and other minor words unwritten and rendering each word with a single ideogram, but all the functional classes of hieroglyphs later employed were differentiated before the end of this period. Though sometimes written with carbon ink, hiero- glyphs had been designed for monuments rather than manuscripts. The cursive script known as hieratic was developed by writing hieroglyphs rapidly in ink with a frayed rush pen. Dynastic art in sculpture and bas-relief seems to have been created by profes- sional artists to immortalize the members of the new royal society. It was not derived from the folk art of prehistoric Egypt or from any known foreign source. Both in style and purpose it diverged profoundly from prehistoric tradi- tions. Portrait sculpture in stone, attempting to provide an imperishable body for the dead, attained perfection a few decades after it began. Stone bas-reliefs portrayed animals and birds realistically and delineated the muscles and other details of human anatomy with lifelike accuracy. Draftsmen now adopted the typical Egyptian compromise between profile and front views of the human figure. Stone masonry, first used as a lining for royal tombs, satisfied the demand of the mortuary cult for eternal durability. Other new architectural features included the lotus pattern on the capitals of columns, the decoration of walls with glazed tiles, corbelled stone vaults, and "barrel vaults" in leaning courses of mud brick. 5</page><page sequence="6">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The first religious inscriptions indicate that several local or territorial deities had recently been elevated to national status. The titles of most of the kings embody the name of Horus, a falcon-headed sun-god probably native to Lower Egypt, but one substitutes that of Seth, an Upper Egyptian god, and that of the last ruler of the Second Dynasty combines the names of both. From the unrecorded prehistoric cults emerge a dozen gods and goddesses with much the same attributes that they will bear in times to come, but not holding the same relative importance. Neith, represented by a shield crossed diagonally by two arrows, was the leading patroness of royalty. The inscriptions mention a periodic festival for the god Sokri and festivals celebrating the birth of various other deities, notably Mafdet, Min, two jackal-headed gods, and the goddesses Maat and Seskhat. Heriskhef was the tutelary god of Herakleopolis. Several deities were represented by animal figures. Min, on a standard of Hierakonpolis, has the head of a wild sheep. Seth, who had not yet acquired the evil character given him by later theologians, was figured as a problematical quadruped which may possibly have been an okapi or wild hog but was more likely fanciful. One jackal- headed god, whose name was spelled phonetically SEZ, was borne on a royal standard, and another resembled the god later known as Imiut of the Siut dis- trict-a post hung with a jackal skin and usually topped with a jackal head. A local deity with the head of a crane or ibis may perhaps have been Thoth. One of the earliest kings, wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, is shown with a vulture- headed goddess who has been tentatively identified as Nekhbet. A solar deity was represented by a winged disc. Though the sun-god Re had probably entered the official pantheon, the supposed references to Amun at this early date are very doubtful. A conflict between the dogmas of Heliopolis, with the sun-god as their leading deity, and the dogmas of Memphis centering on the local creator-god Ptah, has been inferred for this period from later sources. Religious and political symbols familiar in later Egypt had already been adopted. A bird figure stood for the soul of the gods. Male deities carried the was sceptre symbolic of "well being"-a staff with a diagonal head and a bifur- cated butt, similar to the camel-stick of the modern bedawin of northwestern Arabia. Female deities carried a reed. Gods were shown presenting the king with the was sceptre, the ankh or loop-headed "cross of life," and the symbol waz, "freshness." Upper Egypt was symbolized by a liliaceous plant, Lower Egypt by a cluster of papyrus. The insignia of kingship were the crowns of these two regions and the flail. The Sed festival or royal jubilee, perhaps celebrating the thirtieth year after the proclamation of the sovereign as heir, was performed as a double rite to com- 6</page><page sequence="7">DYNASTIC EGYPT memorate the union of Upper and Lower Egypt. In another ceremony the king dramatized the yearly Nile flood by carrying the hieroglyphic sign HAP beside a running bull. Ablution, libation, and fumigation by incense were important ritualistic elements. People of the ruling class buried their dead in large under- ground chambers covered by flat superstructures of brick with sloping sides, near which they erected stone stelae bearing the name of the deceased and often a figure of him seated on a chair before a table of offerings. By extending foreign trade and organizing domestic industry and commerce the monarchy stimulated many new developments in the arts and crafts. Among the innovations probably derived from Asia were grapes, wine, and a breed of cattle with horns projecting forward in an ellipse almost closed at the ends. An increased supply of copper led to new types of copper objects: bowls, adze-blades with rounded butts, fish-hooks (still without barbs), crudely notched saws, larger chisels, and double-edged knives, one form of which, apparently specialized for cutting linen on a board, was sharpened only on convex curves at the top and bottom of the blade. The rising activity in wood-working may have been due to the increase in copper tools, but it was probably stimulated, like the con- temporary surge of brick-making, by the demands of the monarchy for more impressive architecture and furnishings. Smiths cast copper by the cire perdue process, plated it mechanically with silver, and made chains. Flint tools assumed new forms, one of which was a scraper with rounded ends. Flint knives, very uniform throughout southern and middle Egypt, were finely curved, and had a notch handle in the first half of the period; in the second half they became coarser and their backs almost straight. Pottery began to be shaped on a slow wheel, thus becoming still more commercialized and losing most of its esthetic value. This transition is reflected in the uniformity of ceramic styles throughout the southern and central parts of the country. Very large jars slung in cordage, and pottery ring-stands for keeping the bottoms of vessels off the ground, were used for the first time. Some people were buried in pottery coffins. While ceramics deteriorated under mass production, stone vessels, sometimes hollowed by means of a tubular drill, were fashioned more skillfully and artisically than ever before. Spoons and slate cosmetic palettes, formerly so common, now became obsolete, and a taller, conical form of spindle whorl replaced the flat type of the late Predynastic. From now on people slept on a frame bed with a web surface. The legs of the bed, as well of other furniture, were often carved to represent the feet of cattle, or more rarely of lions. Thin armlets of flint and fine articles of ivory came into vogue. 7</page><page sequence="8">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY 2980-2625 BC DYNASTIES III-V 355 YEARS THE PYRAMID AGE During the next four centuries the institutions supported by the royal class were elaborated, formalized, and magnified in scale. The capital was at Memphis, near the modern Cairo, giving national dominance to Lower Egyptian features in religion and art. Inscriptions, now much more numerous, show the hiero- glyphic and hieratic systems fully established. The official need for strict survey- ing and accounting, and the precision demanded of architects and masons in fitting together large blocks of polished stone, led to accurate techniques for weighing and measuring and to the development of applied geometry, a trend that reached its fullest expression between 2900 and 2750 in the Great Pyramids of Giza. While the decoration of many stone buildings reproduced the struc- tural details of earlier architecture in wood, matting, and reeds, certain new devices appeared, notably the torus and the cavetto cornice. The decoration was more lavish, delicate, and imaginative in the Third Dynasty (2980-2930) and the Fifth (2750-2625) than in the Fourth, probably because it originated in Lower Egypt, whereas the heavier and more austere style of the Fourth Dynasty originated in the south. Stone bas-reliefs were cut much lower and flatter than formerly and in a more conventional style. The fine limestone murals for which Egypt is famous began suddenly at about 2900 BC. Portrait statues, maintaining the high esthetic and technical standards of the former age, gave more emphasis to the personality of the subject. Minor technology also changed considerably during these four centuries. Potters now fashioned their vessels on a fast wheel and specialized in plain, finely baked bowls in a red ware, no longer making the very large jars typical of the former period. From an artistic point of view, stone vessels deteriorated. Several new pigments, including azurite and a blue composed of a double silicate of calcium and copper, were added to the artist's palette. Paste mosaic, a method of adorning walls by hollowing out the figures and filling them with colored plaster, was abandoned after a few experiments because the plaster fell out. Trade with Asia under the highly centralized government brought large quan- tities of Asiatic wood to the royal workshops. Gold work was exceptionally skillful, particularly between 2750 and 2625; and silver, though still rarer than gold, was sometimes used as a solder for joining copper. If two small, unworked pieces of bronze belong to this period, they are the earliest specimens of this alloy from Egypt. The government valued goods according to a metal standard, the nature of which has not been determined. Paper was now manufactured 8</page><page sequence="9">DYNASTIC EGYPT from the papyrus reed and used for recording the temple accounts. Boatmen steered their square-sailed ships by a vertical tiller projecting downward from the steering-oar. A copper axe-blade with a semicircular cutting edge and a deeply scalloped back evolved from the earlier narrow form. The pear-shaped mace went out of actual use, though it continued to be shown in hieroglyphs and royal scenes. The harp, which later became the leading musical instrument, seems to have been invented or introduced at this time. It was about four feet high and had only five or six strings; unlike the larger harps of later times, it was played sitting. Chairs with arms and high backs came into fashion about 2650 but soon went out. A round copper mirror with a short tang for the handle was added to the woman's toilet kit. People who wished to keep their coiffures from being mussed while reclining rested their heads or necks on a pedestal with a concave top, with a linen pad or a bag of chaff added for comfort. A plain, solid head- rest was typical from 2900 to 2700, though several types with stems and rectan- gular bases were likewise in vogue. These bear a striking resemblance to the head-rests used recently by the natives of the Congo and East Africa. From this period comes the first record of myrrh, which must have been imported from a considerable distance. The state religion seems to have become more elaborate, though this impres- sion may be only the result of a fuller record. Much of our information in this field comes from the mythological and magical texts inscribed on the inner walls of pyramids between 2750 and 2475 BC. In many cases it is impossible to say whether these represented the contemporary religion or whether they were only archaistic survivals. We must also discount the efforts of court theologians to support the monarchy by revising old dogmas or by inventing new ones which never gained general acceptance. We should not assume that the doctrines em- bodied in the Pyramid Texts ever formed a theological system or that they were held in toto by any one community; but if we accept them only as folklore from various parts of Egypt, collected and edited by royal propagandists, they may give us at least an inkling of ancient cults otherwise unknown. Internal evidence, such as the implication that Upper and Lower Egypt were mutually hostile coun- tries, suggests that some of the beliefs recorded in the Pyramid Texts had been current before the First Dynasty. Prominent cosmogonic deities were the earth- god Geb and the sky-goddess Nut; Shu, the void between earth and sky, holding up Nut with his arms; Sah, identified with the constellation Orion; and the star Sirius, associated with the Nile flood. The texts also mention, and to some extent equate, various solar deities whom we may suppose to have been worshipped originally in different localities: Re, Atum the offspring of Geb and Nut, and 9</page><page sequence="10">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY several gods called Horus, whose confused history has led Egyptologists into interminable speculations. The falcon-headed Horus incarnate in the living king, and the Horus who played a legendary role as the son of Osiris and Isis and the enemy of Seth, may originally have been two distinct deities. The sky-goddess Hathor, "the House of Horus," gradually lost her celestial functions but devel- oped a strong royal cult as consort of the sun. The ritualistic practices of libation and lustration were rationalized theologically in the daily rebirth of the sun from the waters and the revivifying of the corpse of Osiris by water. Osiris, who now first appears under this name (Wesir), was identified with the constellation Orion and with Wepwawet, a deity of canine form wor- shipped at Abydos, while his consort Isis was identified with the star Sirius. He represented the dead kings, thus complementing the function of Horus who represented the kings while alive. The texts refer to the murder of Osiris by Seth, his subsequent resurrection, and the efforts of Horus to avenge his death. Since Horus lost one of his eyes in this heroic conflict, "the eye of Horus" became a euphemism for religious offering. A rite performed on mortuary statues repre- sented the opening of the mouth of Osiris by Horus. One text relates that after the gods command the dead king to rise, Geb opens his mouth, and Horus and Thoth set him upright on the throne of Osiris, where Isis and Nephthys salute him as the divinity. The moral implications prominent in later Egyptian theology are already evident: the dead is judged by Osiris, and his past actions must be justified before he is accepted by the gods. Certain passages in the Pyramid Texts suggest ancient religious dramas, two of which may have been perpetuated in the rituals of the Nile flood and of the death and resurrection of Osiris. Between 2930 and 2750 the rulers promoted the cult of Atum and Re, solar gods who had presumably been worshipped by two distinct portions of the earlier population. In the same two centuries the goddesses Hathor and Nut were served by numerous priests and priestesses of the nobility, and in certain rites, notably the Sed festival, an order of musician priestesses attended the king. Neith, Hathor, Wepwawet, Thoth, and deified kings also had special prophetesses. After 2750, when Atum was officially identified with Re, the reigning kings were regarded as his sons and were assimilated in his divinity after death. Nine deities -Atum-Re, Shu, Tefnet, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys-took the leading parts in the creation myth and were particularly associated with the town of Heliopolis. Theologically they were often treated as a single deity, giving a precedent for the grouping of other deities in sets of nine. The members of certain professions paid reverence to divine patrons and served as their priests: jurists to Maat the goddess of truth, physicians to 10</page><page sequence="11">DYNASTIC EGYPT Sekhmet, artists to the creator-god Ptah. The god Thoth had prominent celestial functions. Double temples were built for the celebration of the Sed festival. Natron, used primarily as a mouthwash and hence as a purificatory offering in certain rites, was also applied as a dehydrating agent to the bodies of the dead. Royal corpses were carefully wrapped in strips of linen over which a resinous liquid was poured. Bas-reliefs in royal tombs depicted the earthly life of the king, and the mortuary stela, instead of standing free, was encased in the masonry of the tomb. 2625-2160 BC DYNASTIES VI-X 465 YEARS THE FIRST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD As the pharaohs lost their power and the central monarchy disintegrated into several small local dynasties, many Asiatics infiltrated the northern part of the country. Cultural changes in the First Intermediate period reflect both of these historical events. The breakdown of the political structure opened the way for a social revolution which diffused the former perquisites of royalty among the lower orders. As a result of this upheaval, contemporary literature is more preoccupied with social and moral problems than with theology. Several changes in the grammar of the written language, such as the tendency to replace synthetic tense forms by analytic ones, may have been due to colloquial influence. From now on they led gradually toward the literary idiom which was to crystallize after 2160 as the classical "Middle Egyptian." Determinative ideograms, not to be pronounced, were appended to the spelling of most words except particles. Mural artists painted more naturalistic figures, and sculptors working at various towns in the valley developed moderately independent styles instead of following that of the capital. The mortuary cult of Osiris, highly elaborated for the aristocracy after 2600, later spread among all social classes, stimulating vivid popular conceptions of the other world and enabling anyone who could afford a proper funeral to become Osiris after death. Abydos, his traditional burial place, became a sort of national cemetery. Soon after 2625 the viscera of the dead began to be deposited in a set of four Canopic jars. Corpses were no longer buried in the contracted posi- tion but were laid out at full length in a high, narrow, rectangular coffin with a human eye painted in a panel on the exterior. In Middle Egypt the provisions and furnishings for the dead were pictured on the inside of the coffin, together with the religious and magical passages known as the Coffin Texts. Upper Egyptian coffins usually had blank interiors but were inscribed externally with lists of offerings and sometimes painted with scenes. Directly over the mummy was placed a mask of cartonnage. In masculine burials this bore a short, spread- 11</page><page sequence="12">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY ing beard and a moustache, though the moustache had recently gone out of actual fashion. Miniature models of boats, granaries, servants, and artisans at work were deposited in the tombs as a cheap substitute for murals. Mortuary stelae were carelessly executed, and inscribed with a slipshod mixture of hieratic and hieroglyphic characters. People wrote letters to the dead on pottery vessels con- taining offerings of food. Contemporary religion shows few innovations outside of the mortuary field. In the middle of this period, when the chiefs of Herakleopolis held extensive sway, their ram-headed god Heriskhef gained temporary importance as a solar deity. Certain priestesses, including those of Iunmutef, were entitled "concubines of the god." The earliest scarabs-small charms in the form of the sacred beetle -had geometric figures, scrolls, and lotus patterns incised on their flat bases. The sistrum, a jingling musical instrument associated with the goddess Hathor, was carved typically in the form of a papyrus plant. In this era of political and economic disruption, technology made few ad- vances. The copper mines of Sinai were abandoned or operated only to a very small extent. Stonemasons dressed their blocks with copper chisels and scrapers, though they still used the adze for trimming the corners. We now find the first copper hair-curler, an instrument composed of a knife and a little trough pinned together like a pair of scissors, so that the back of the knife could be recessed into the trough. Other probable innovations were date wine, the mechanical plat- ing of copper with gold, the use of green frit as a pigment, and a post for supporting the steering-oar at the stern of the ship. Two new features probably derived from Asia were the so-called button seals, which were much in vogue between 2600 and 2300 but went out of fashion thereafter, and the ritualistic use of seven instead of the number four which had prevailed in earlier times. 2160-1788 BC DYNASTIES XI AND XII 372 YEARS THE MIDDLE KINGDOM The political reunification of Egypt under the Eleventh Dynasty, with its capital at Thebes, inaugurated a new era of progress and gave national dominance to certain styles and institutions which heretofore had prevailed only in the Theban district. For various reasons the brilliant culture of the Twelfth Dynasty, with its capitals in the Faiyum and near the modern towns of Lisht and Dahshur, south of Cairo, deserves a place by itself; but since much of the information from both these dynasties has been published only with the ambiguous label "Middle Kingdom," it would be impractical to separate them in this elementary survey. 12</page><page sequence="13">DYNASTIC EGYPT The popularizing trend of the past four centuries had bequeathed to people of the middle class, all over the country, large artistic and religious legacies from the pharaohs of the Pyramid Age. The pleated kilt, formerly distinctive of royalty, was now worn by commoners. Capes, cloaks, shawls and flowing gowns supplemented the simple loincloths and straight dresses typical of the Old King- dom. Instead of going naked, as in the Old Kingdom, children of respectable families now wear conventional clothing. Fine scarabs, now inscribed with lab- rynthine designs instead of spirals, were used abundantly as seals in bezel rings and lost much of their religious value. Those typical of the Twelfth Dynasty had long bodies and striated legs. Cylinder seals disappeared. The recent social revolution may also have been reflected in the greater variety of personal names and the closer moral relationship between the worshipper and the gods. From now on one's fortune after death depended on one's conduct during life. The epithet "justified" appended to the name of the deceased ("the Osiris so-and-so") bespoke his right to immortality. But this ethical attitude did not inhibit the mechanical ritualism so typical of Egypt. Persons too poor for expensive funerals and tombs resorted to cheap imitations or purchased a minor share in the cults of the great. Some of them covered their graves with little pyramids of brick. The more prosperous set up their mortuary statues in the temples, where they contracted with the clergy for specific offerings and hoped to benefit by the serv- ices rendered the gods. Private tombs and funerary stelae in the first two centuries of this period were decorated in a careless, degraded manner. The prevalence of magic may be regarded as another manifestation of the same popularizing trend. Commoners now made free use of funerary spells originally inscribed for royalty. The Book of the Dead, a series of verbal charms written on papyrus and de- posited with the mummy, performed the function of the former Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, with more particular emphasis on magic and sorcery, and the spells inscribed on coffins employed the names of the souls of certain festivals and sacred localities as instruments of magical power. Pairs of ivory wands, often carved in the shape of human hands, were presumably used as a supernatural means of protection. The written language was stabilized as the classical Middle Egyptian, with a more consistent spelling and a florid, metaphorical style. Several new letters were added to the alphabet as alternatives to those already in use. Two new forms of hieratic, one more cursive than the other, and both with an orthography distinct from that of the hieroglyphs, replaced the older, thick-lined script. In the Twelfth Dynasty all classes of documents were written in a very uniform language; hieratic became still more cursive, adopted many new spellings and 13</page><page sequence="14">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY made a greater use of determinative signs; and a new syllabic orthography de- veloped in hieroglyphs. The literary works of the Middle Kingdom surpass those of any other period in number, variety, and quality, and were to serve as models for scribes in later times. Tomb murals, though crude in the early part of the Eleventh Dynasty, im- proved remarkably thereafter and reached a new peak of excellence in the Twelfth, when they were executed in bas-relief and sunken relief with delicate, graceful lines. The vigorous naturalism of portrait sculpture in the Twelfth Dynasty rivalled the best Old Kingdom work, though modified by certain con- ventions, such as the unnaturally high position of the ear. Typical of this period was the figure of a sitting man with the knees drawn up to the chest and the flat sides of the statue inscribed. Small effigies of standing lions were also common. Technology gained from the trade with Asia and the Aegean fostered by the new monarchy. Metallurgy progressed rapidly after the introduction of bronze from Western Asia and the reopening, under royal auspices, of the Sinai copper mines which had been little exploited for the past six hundred years. In the Twelfth Dynasty many tools and weapons were made of bronze, cast by the cire perdue process with an ash core. The semicircular heads of battle axes were lengthened to double their width, small chisels set in wooden handles made their first appearance, and a razor with a crescentic or semicircular blade replaced the straight-edged type. Flint went out of use for the blades of hoes and other com- mon implements, though a few flint axes were shaped to imitate those of metal. The last flint knives were made with straight backs and without the handle notch typical of earlier forms. Various other foreign innovations accompanied the introduction of bronze. Wooly sheep with curved horns, presumably Asiatic, superseded the ancient hairy variety with low, flat horns projecting laterally. Some of the cattle show one of the horns trained artificially downward, reminiscent of a recent East African practice. The lyre, now played by Egyptian musicians for the first time, was probably borrowed from Western Asia or the Aegean. The domestic cat now appears for the first time, probably introduced from Asia or the Sudan. Ships were rigged with a single fixed mast instead of the demountable double mast typical of the Old Kingdom; and the sail, which was proportionately lower and broader than heretofore, was hoisted on a yard. Some of the pottery in the Twelfth Dynasty bore handles, unusual for ancient Egypt; and the fantastic shapes of pottery vessels in vogue at the end of this period suggest a foreign source. The cowry shell motif popular in jewelry of the Twelfth Dynasty may 14</page><page sequence="15">DYNASTIC EGYPT have been derived from abroad. Another probable innovation was the use of red kermes dye for leather. Other technological changes seem to have originated in Egypt. Some of the common pottery styles of the Twelfth Dynasty-drop-shaped vases with spherical bases in a thin, drab ware, vessels with angular patterns incised, and large storage jars with short and very narrow necks-may be purely native creations. The artisans' bow-drill with a loose cap was probably an outgrowth of the weighted drills of the Old Kingdom. Spindle whorls were usually cylindrical. Women in the Eleventh Dynasty applied their eye-paint with a small rod or stiletto, and double tubes of limestone for cosmetics came into fashion in the Twelfth. The "snake game," played by two opponents on a spiral board, now went out of use. After 2475, vessels of diorite and alabaster became less common. The wealthy feudal lords of the Twelfth Dynasty set high standards in the decorative arts, especially jewelry and bric-a-brac. Artisans now manufactured true glass, as distinct from faience or glaze with a frit core, and applied a thin layer of felspar as a protective surface over glaze. Jewelers, more skillful and imaginative than ever before, employed a new technique of granulated gold work and specialized in soldered cloisonne set with carnelian. The cowrie shell and the reef knot were favorite motifs, and gold rosettes were often attached to wigs and garments. Imported obsidian was used extensively for making vases and ornaments. In the Eleventh Dynasty the dominance of Thebes as the political center brought into national ascendancy several local gods of this district, notably Amun, Min, and Montu. Amun was now identified with Re and Atum as the supreme, solar deity, though he retained the blue skin and the high plumed head-dress which mark him as an early Theban relative of Min. Superficial changes in ritual before the year 2000 suggest profound modifications in the official religion and foreshadow the ecclesiastical developments of the next few centuries. The royal toilet apartment, so prominent in the daily ceremonial of kings in former times, seems to have lost its sanctity except in certain temples, and the sistrum in papyrus form gave place to one with a looped top and the head of the goddess Hathor. In the Twelfth Dynasty we find the first evidence of the ritual of the teknu, an animal skin of unknown significance, and the first month-calendar of lucky and unlucky days. Mortuary practices diverged sharply from those of the past five centuries. The tomb styles of the Old Kingdom were partially revived and the small mor- tuary models characteristic of the preceding period went out of use. Sawdust, beeswax, and henna were used in embalming. Human figurines known as ushabties 15</page><page sequence="16">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY were now occasionally placed in the tomb, probably to represent the dead. The cartonnage mask covering the mummy developed into an anthropomorphic inner coffin. 1788-1580 BC DYNASTIES XIII-XVII 208 YEARS THE SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD After the collapse of the feudal monarchy Egypt was invaded by the Asiatics known as the Hyksos, who ruled the northern half of the country from their capital in the eastern Delta for more than a century. They introduced horses, bareback riding, and horse-drawn chariots, the two-edged dagger with a midrib, and a lute with a small body and a long neck played with a plectrum. To them may probably be attributed several new styles of pottery: buff or brick-red ware painted with geometric designs in dark brown or black; small jugs with handles, decorated with dots and lines filled with white paint; and vessels modelled in the form of animals and birds. They promoted the cult of the god Seth, whom they identified with one of their own deities. From their language Egyptian assim- ilated many Semitic words. Other changes took place independently or as the indirect results of the Hyksos domination. The literary language began to show grammatical tendencies characteristic of later times, such as the use of the definite article. Hieroglyphic inscriptions were sometimes stamped on stucco with a wooden mould. Rings of gold, silver, and bronze were standardized for valuing other goods and as media of exchange. Copper mining in Sinai slackened, but flint arrowheads were en- tirely replaced by those of metal. Among minor refinements came the engraving of glass, the use of a horn container with the large end closed and the small end serving as a spout or spoon, high-shouldered pots for eye paint, and the head- rest with the very long base. Outer coffins shaped like a mummy came into fashion early in this period. The most elegant were of the "rishi" style, with the painted wings of a deity spreading over a background of gold leaf. A more puzzling, though less impressive, mortuary innovation was the practice of de- positing onions in the mummy's abdomen. 1580-1350 BC DYNASTY XVIII 230 YEARS The two centuries of imperial expansion into western Asia and the Sudan brought more innovations than any other period of equal length. From Asia the Egyptians imported and adopted several military improvements, such as the horse-drawn chariot (with wheels of four spokes till about 1450, but with six spokes thereafter), the compound bow made of horn, sinew, and wood, scale 16</page><page sequence="17">DYNASTIC EGYPT armor (called by the Semitic word siryon), the dirk of copper or bronze, and the battle axe-head with a narrow waist. Two Asiatic trees, the pomegranate and the almond, were added to Egyptian gardens; and the olive, though probably naturalized in much earlier times, now seems to have been cultivated more ex- tensively. Cattle of the zebu variety, with a boss over the shoulder and moderately long horns, were first brought as tribute from western Asia. A strong white hunting-dog, perhaps from southern Arabia or the Horn of East Africa, began to rival the slim native greyhound as a favorite pet. Bronze made with Syrian tin became the normal metal for tools and weapons; small quantities of iron began to be imported, though not yet used for implements; and silver-probably from a newly tapped Asiatic source-was used in larger quantities. Copper was now brought from Asia, since the nearby mines in Sinai and the eastern desert no longer sufficed. Various Asiatic textiles came into fashion, notably a rippled cloth and a polychrome fabric in tapestry weave with a slit left along the vertical edge of the color field. The upright loom now used for weaving linen may have been recently introduced from Asia; so far as I know, earlier pictures of weaving show only a horizontal loom pegged close to the ground. Other innovations probably of eastern origin were the trumpet, the rectangular tambourine, drink- ing sets with funnels and strainers made of metal or faience, yellow jasper, yellow orpiment for paint, cinnamon, and a peculiar form of stone vessel with three raised ribs around the body, sometimes with a low foot or set on a separate stand. Foreign conquest resulted in an increase of slaves, if not in the very beginning of slavery in Egypt. The king bestowed prisoners of war on their captors, while male and female slaves were sometimes dedicated to temples. It was perhaps to emulate oriental monarchs that the pharaohs made such a show of big game hunting, especially the lion hunt. Mural scenes after 1420 indicate that com- moners no longer indulged in this sport. The prosperity attending the expansion of the empire led to a cultural efflores- cense, not as originative as the Old Kingdom in graphic art, or as the Twelfth Dynasty in literature, but generous in luxuries and congenial to the parvenu. Contemporary documents suggest a social flux in which people from many levels of society were intermingling close to the top. "Late Egyptian," written in hiero- glyphs after the seventeenth century, seems to have approximated everyday speech. It is distinguished from earlier idioms by many new words for common things, by the prevalence of analytic verb forms, by an indefinite article derived from the numeral "one" and a definite article from a demonstrative adjective, and by the shift of the accent from the first to the later syllables of a word or phrase. Hieroglyphic spelling abounded in functionless signs and etymological 17</page><page sequence="18">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY fabrications, as if it were vainly trying to keep pace with the spoken language. In the new hieratic writing the phonetic rendering usually followed the ideogram. Art became light and graceful, rendered typically in rapid, brilliant techniques rather than in the more laborious ones. Flat painting was employed instead of bas-relief for tomb murals after the first few decades of the era. Glass was now made transparent, and hot, malleable rods of glass in various colors were fash- ioned into vessels by winding them around a temporary core and fusing them together. Before these viscous coils had cooled and hardened they were drawn downward on the outer surface with a pointed instrument to bind them together and give a very pretty chevron effect. In the latter part of the era, faience and glaze were colored in greater variety than heretofore: pure white, polychrome, violet, purple, yellow, chocolate brown, and several shades of pale green. Ala- baster vases came back into fashion after a lapse of several centuries, but stone vessels in general had been superseded by fine pottery and faience. The typical pottery had a softer texture than that of the Twelfth Dynasty. Early in the era it was often decorated with a red band around the top, in later times with black and red lines. Blue frit in lines and bands began to be applied to pottery about 1400 BC and was later expanded to larger surfaces of the vessel. Household furniture was distinguished by the introduction of foot-stools, the return of chairs with arms and high backs after an absence of a thousand years, and legs carved more often in the form of lion's feet than in those of the bull. Figures of geese and ducks were a favorite motif in the applied arts, especially for toilet articles. There is some reason for believing that Egyptian music made the first use of half-tones in this era. Personal adornment changed considerably. Disc beads of ostrich egg shell went abruptly out of use, as if the refinements of the new era left no place for such prehistoric barbarities. Ear ornaments such as plugs, studs and rings, worn sparingly in former times, now came into general vogue, perhaps as an Asiatic innovation. To women's costume were added a headband about an inch broad, tied behind (where the ends did not meet) with a pair of strings, and the so-called "festal cone" of some undetermined substance, possibly wax or unguent, worn on top of the head. Women's costume, like the men's, is almost entirely white, in contrast to the colored garments worn by women in the Middle Kingdom and earlier. On some occasions the king wore a new form of helmet, covered with circles like curls of hair. Scarabs and seals lost their spiral designs in the first half of the period and were later designed to commemorate royal events, such as the king's hunting expedition. Several technological changes seem to have evolved independently in Egypt, 18</page><page sequence="19">DYNASTIC EGYPT though a foreign source may yet be discovered. Reapers now left a taller stubble, possibly because the increase in livestock had made forage more valuable. The plow was given longer handles, connected to each other by cross-beams, and was harnessed to the ox by a neck-yoke and a broad strap as an alternative mode to the earlier type of yoke across the horns. A long-handled wooden hammer was utilized for breaking clods. The sails of ships broadened to about twice the height of the mast, so that the yard had to be made of two poles lashed together end to end. Smiths blew up their fires by a pair of drum bellows worked with the feet, instead of by mouth through a blowpipe. At the end of the era they began to alloy copper with gold. In the middle of the sixteenth century an Egyp- tian invented a graduated vessel to measure the subdivisions of the night by the outflow of water. A conical grater made of a strip of bronze punched and coiled was used for some domestic purpose, and conical spindle whorls replaced the cylindrical ones of the Twelfth Dynasty. A new form of harpoon was adopted. The religious trend was generally cumulative, excluding no important earlier features but emphasizing several which had their origin in Thebes, the capital of the empire, or which enhanced the glory of the ruling class. After the Hyksos domination the emperors officially opposed the cult of Seth, whom the invaders had adopted as their patron, and exalted the solar god Amun-Re, now entitled "the king of the gods." Large temples of sandstone-a material now preferred to limestone-housed his image in a dark holy-of-holies behind a series of court- yards and columned halls. Queens assumed the title "god's wife of Amun" and were identified with Hathor, the traditional consort of Re. In the reign of Amen- hotep III, at the beginning of the fourteenth century, Amun was identified with Re-Horakhti under the name of Aton and tended to become a purely solar deity, foreshadowing the monotheistic cult imposed by Amenhotep IV. Agricultural scenes include little shrines of Ernutet or Renent, the snake-figured goddess of the harvest. The relationship between the worshipper and the gods seems to have become more personal; on mortuary stelae the dead addressed his prayers directly to Osiris and Re. Infants were often named from minor deities whose blessing had brought their birth, or from places and monuments associated with such deities, a practice which had been followed only sporadically in the past few centuries. Several ancient monuments such as the sphinx of Giza were now deified. The moralistic aspect of religion is manifested clearly in negative con- fessions inscribed to the gods by groups of middle-class workmen at Thebes. Royal tombs no longer had superstructures above ground but were excavated in the bed rock; the door was hidden by the talus; and the entrance passage, mined with a defensive well, led through an antechamber to the sepulchral hall. Tomb 19</page><page sequence="20">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY murals showed the deceased receiving official honors and enjoying the life of this world with his family, and depicted his funeral and the post-mortuary feasts. Objects for the use of the dead, such as had been pictured on the inner walls of coffins in the Middle Kingdom, were now represented by very small models depos- ited with the mummy. Though coffins continued to be shaped to fit the mummy and to be decorated with elaborate symbolic designs, the "rishi" type went out of use. The reforming movement commonly attributed to Amenhotep IV (Ikhna- ton) had its root in the reign of his predecessor. Under Amenhotep III the god Amun, with the name of Aton, had tended to assimilate the other solar deities. Even before Ikhnaton suppressed the cult of Amun, the sun-god of Heliopolis was honored at Thebes. The high priest in a new solar temple at Karnak bore the same title as his counterpart at Heliopolis, and the Mnevis bull of Helio- polis also had a shrine there. At the beginning of his reign, Ikhnaton assumed the title of "High Priest of Re,"' but not long thereafter the name of the sun god was officially changed to "Aton." The new theology envisaged Aton as the sun itself, perhaps in a more concrete and literal sense than had been true of any Egyptian deity up to this time. His temple, modelled on the ancient one at Heliopolis, was a courtyard open to the sky. The common people continued their private worship of Ptah and other gods, but the state religion became rigidly monotheistic. Ikhnaton directed his iconoclasm most energetically against the cult of Amun, but he also persecuted those of Osiris, Isis, Horus, Atum, Montu, Geb, Nekhbet, and the sacred bull, and had their names erased from the monu- ments. Scribes avoided the plural of the word for "god," and when writing the words "god" and "mother" substituted alphabetical signs for the conventional falcon and vulture hieroglyphs, since these had idolatrous connotations. Ikhnaton's suppression of the Osiris cult entailed extensive alterations in the theology and ritual of death. Contemporary inscriptions ignore the other world and the judgment meted out to the soul. "To be buried"' was the only euphem- ism used for "to die." The dead were called "living souls" and were thought to dwell more or less indefinitely in their tombs. Heart scarabs were inscribed with a prayer to Aton, and a figure of the deified queen took the place of Isis and Nephthys on the coffin. This religious reform was accompanied by liberal trends in language, social attitudes, and art. In the inscriptions the colloquial idiom now replaced the stilted literary language. When referring to Syrians and Ethiopians, official writings ceased to treat them as contemptible barbarians. Artists portrayed animals, birds, and people in a free, lifelike style, often as outright caricatures. The lean, hard 20</page><page sequence="21">DYNASTIC EGYPT faces, elongated heads, narrow hands and necks, and slack, protruding bellies of many of their human figures may have originated in the inherited traits of the royal family, in whose portraits they are consistently emphasized. During the reign of Ikhnaton, artists painted highlights and shadows and drew the human face with a dark line between the lips. One of their favorite subjects was the domestic life of the king. Architects now made the first use of the "broken lintel" and introduced certain practical improvements in the new royal palace, such as stone baths, and stone toilet seats with side compartments for sand. 1350-1090 BC DYNASTIES XIX AND XX 260 YEARS The trends that had begun with the rise of Egypt's Asiatic empire were accelerated in its decline. Religion, supported by a lush theology and a venal priesthood, reacted vigorously against the recent monotheistic movement. Art became more ornate but lost its imaginative and expressive power. Literature displayed a larger vocabulary but few original ideas. Many importations from Asia enriched material life without altering its essential conservatism. The priests of Amun, rebounding from their suppression by Ikhnaton, joined forces with his successors to raise their cult to unprecedented wealth and power. Amun was proclaimed officially as the primordial deity and the possessor of all the land and waters. His clergy rapidly increased, enrolling men and women of all social classes. His images, as well as those of deified kings who were identi- fied with him, gave oracular decisions by "nodding," a procedure which was sometimes used to decide legal disputes. His secret name was unknown to the other gods and would bring instant death to anyone who pronounced it. Ptah, the patron of Memphis, was identified with Amun and with several lesser deities and elsewhere, and associated in a supreme triad with Amun and Re. Royal scenes with the king as protege of Amun were grandly portrayed on temple walls. Hathor, the leading goddess, was symbolized by the beadwork collar called the menat and by the sistrum in the form of a naos, which now reappeared after an absence of two or three centuries. Her numerous priestesses were themselves called "Hathors," and other female deities, such as Wasit of Thebes, assumed her name and titles and participated with her in the worship of Amun. Both she and Osiris were worshipped in the sycamore tree, which was said to have grown from Osiris' corpse. The kings reigning in the twelfth century made Osiris the head of the pantheon. Many other gods profited by the polytheistic reaction, especially Re-Horakhti, a favorite of the masses, and three military figures: Seth the patron of warriors, Montu the god of war, and Shed the divine charioteer. Animal cults gained new popularity; the Ram of Mendes ("Life of Re") and the 21</page><page sequence="22">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Apis and Mnevis bulls lived regally with a harem of cows and were embalmed and entombed like kings. Reverence was also paid to certain Syrian deities, such as the war-goddess Asit, Astarte, Baal, and Reshep. In practice the religion of this era showed a sense of sin, self-abasement, and personal dependence on the gods, and a tendency to interpret theological doc- trines in ethical and allegorical terms. Common people often bore the names of kings and deities, appealed to Amun and others to relieve them of their ills, and inscribed penitential psalms to Amun, to deceased kings, to Horus Lord of the Heavens, and to the serpent goddess Amentet, Peak of the West. Changes in mortuary customs reflect a more pessimistic outlook on the future life and a perfunctory, somewhat mechanical attitude toward the provisions made for the dead. While the tombs contained less furniture than heretofore, their walls were painted with processions of demons and other infernal horrors instead of with happy, worldly scenes. Three hundred sixty-five ushabti figurines, often with 36 additional figures of "foremen," were deposited with the dead to do the work demanded of him in the other world. The mummiform wooden coffins were painted elaborately with religious tableaux. Poor and middle class people were interred communally in older tombs and were sometimes represented by small wooden models of mummies and coffins buried at the entrance of a wealthy tomb to share in the offerings made there. The Book of the Dead was written in the cursive hieratic script employed in secular documents and was supple- mented by the "Book of Am Duat," a collection of magical formulae for the protection of the dead. Many old forms of amulets, such as human hands and feet and the heads of hippopotamus and leopard, were superseded by symbols and figures of gods. Ostraca were inscribed with elaborate magical spells against human enemies. The colloquial influences apparent in the inscriptions of Ikhnaton's time led to the literary "New Egyptian" of the twelfth century, distinguished from all earlier idioms by its large vocabulary. Hieroglyphic and hieratic writing under- went minor changes in style, with a loss of regularity in spelling and many corruptions in the use of syllabic signs. For certain religious inscriptions in the royal tombs a system of secret writing was employed. Though mural artists had ceased to block out their figures on a temporary grid, their work became stereotyped and lifeless, achieving at best a graceful and ornate effect. Grief was henceforth the only emotion shown in pictures of the human face. The many imposing temples built in this era give more evidence of the wealth and organizing power of the kings than of creative imagination on the part of the architects. Minor arts were equally uninspired and underwent 22</page><page sequence="23">DYNASTIC EGYPT only a few minor changes, such as the formal figures of plants and flowers on the bases of scarabs. Asiatic materials were still imported in large quantities. Some of them seem to have been choice varieties of goods that were commonly produced in Egypt, such as bread and beer; others, like gold, cattle, wood, and boats, had long figured prominently in Egyptian commerce with the east. More recent impor- tations included horses, chariots, wagons, spears, quivers, swords, lyres, and lutes. The first Egyptian picture of a chicken-a red "jungle fowl"-shows a knowl- edge, if not the adoption, of a bird of Indian origin. Iron implements gradually increased, though they were still far from common. Soldiers carried a short, curved sword of Asiatic type. Resin was used in jewelry like a semi-precious stone, and two varieties of varnish, one transparent and the other black, were applied to decorated surfaces. Other innovations which may have been derived from Asia were copper hoe-blades with sockets for hafting, the dovetail method of joinery, barbed fish-hooks with long shanks, a parrying-stick bound to the left forearm for fencing, socks, mittens, and archers' gauntlets. The fine leather socks had a separate pocket for the big toe and were secured with a drawstring. Certain improvements in astronomy and time-keeping have an Asiatic look. The passage of the day was read on a vertical sun-dial, the constellations were charted, and the subdivisions of the night were marked by two observers sitting face to face and taking sights on the stars with relation to certain points on their bodies. Apart from these foreign influences, native Egyptian styles and techniques showed little change. Ceramic types of the preceding period were reproduced with inferior workmanship, though vessels for display were made of a thick, hard pottery decorated with white specks on a drab white slip. The powdered quartz used as a body for objects of faience was coarser than in any other period. The double-edged cutting-out knife for textiles went out of use. Beads of ostrich egg shell came back into fashion. Harps were now made much larger than formerly, with twenty or more strings and an ornately decorated resonance chamber, and were played standing. 1090-663 BC DYNASTIES XXI-XXV 427 YEARS The breakdown of the empire and the brief, chaotic reigns of Libyan and Nubian pharaohs submerged Egypt for four centuries in a kind of stagnation which favored the lush growth of a few institutions but prevented any gen- eral progress. Kings who built temples of stone quarried from older temples typified the decadence of the times. Scribes wrote their hieroglyphic texts in an artificial language which had long ceased to follow the current idiom. Hieratic 23</page><page sequence="24">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY was now regularly used in religious texts and was often inscribed on stone. The more cursive and rapid script known as demotic branched off from hieratic just before the end of the period. The religious trends of the late empire culminated in the eleventh century, when the priests of Amun ruled the district of Thebes and Amun-Re formed a supreme triad with Mut and Khonsu. Though the Libyan kings who ruled Egypt from Bubastis in the middle of the next century chose the local goddess Bastet as their leading deity, they continued to pay homage to Amun at Thebes. The Nubian conquerors in the eighth century made Thebes their capital and gave full support to the cult of Amun. Ptah was later restored to his solar glory by the priests of Memphis and assimilated many minor gods. The papyrus spells and guidebooks to the other world, deposited with the dead, were often accompanied by a wooden statuette of Osiris. Small hieroglyphic amulets on the mummy's neck spelled the "death name" of the deceased. After the middle of the eighth century, coffins were no longer varnished. Embalming reached its highest degree of elaboration in the eleventh century, when the entrails were redeposited in the abdomen instead of in Canopic jars, the brain was removed through the nose, artificial eyes were added to the face, and the cheeks and limbs were often stuffed. After the middle of the next century it rapidly deteriorated. Under the Nubian kings the Egyptians begin to show the retrospective atti- tude which becomes so dominant in the following period; now, for the first time, persons proud of their aristocratic descent include long genealogies in their mor- tuary record. A few technical innovations were introduced from abroad. Iron became abun- dant and was sometimes carburized to make steel. New implements and materials included a long, thin, one-edged iron knife, a socketed mortising chisel of bronze, sardonyx and agate for jewelry, and perhaps indigo dye. Beads of a rich transparent blue glass came into fashion in the latter part of the eighth century. In the ninth century profound economic and social changes are sug- gested by the adoption of silver as the official standard of value, the sale of slaves, and the increase of legal documents for commercial transactions. 663-525 BC DYNASTY XXVI 138 YEARS THE SAITE PERIOD The revival of ancient styles and traditions which began in the first half of the seventh century and continued till late in the sixth seems to have been stimu- lated by foreign immigration. Nubians had ruled Egypt for more than seventy years, Assyrians for seven; a Libyan of Sais founded the Twenty-sixth Dynasty 24</page><page sequence="25">DYNASTIC EGYPT with the aid of Greek and Carian mercenaries. The Nubians had adopted the native cults fanatically and vied with the natives in the observance of ancient Dynastic traditions; it was they who first sponsored the cultural renaissance that reached its peak under the Saites. On the other hand, the Egyptians seem to have reverted to their own sacred past in order to fortify themselves against foreign influence. They reached back more than two thousand years for styles in sculp- ture and painting, court titles, and royal names to inscribe on scarabs and seals. Their copies of ancient scarabs were so exact that it is often hard to tell them from the originals. They deified Imhotep, a famous sage of the early Pyramid Age, as patron of the learned professions, and restored Neith, the tutelary god- dess of Sais, to her ancient prominence as Mother of Re. Though hieratic writing had now been entirely supplanted by the new demotic, scribes modelled their hieroglyphic style on the Middle Egyptian, which had been obsolete for more than a thousand years. Artists copied scenes of hunting and other mundane pleasures from the tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty, with the aid of the tem- porary proportion-squares used by the draftsmen of that period. They sculp- tured the figures with great accuracy and detail, but articulated them in an awkward, lifeless way. Pottery, though technically excellent, was confined to simple, conventional forms such as cylindrical cups, and jars with cylindrical necks and very small handles. Glass vessels were made by the fused rod technique, as in the Empire, and faience was given the pale blue shade which had been fashionable in the Middle Kingdom. The boring of the ear-lobes for heavy orna- ments, in vogue since the Empire, now went out of fashion. Though embalmers used resin rather than natron as a preservative, they reverted to the use of Canopic jars for holding the viscera. The effort to revive the ancient religion without understanding all of its dogmas led to grandiose exaggerations and to a somewhat confused iconography. Many deities were now represented as composite animal figures, often with the body of a falcon. Ushabties wore the upturned beard typical of gods. Animal worship developed exuberantly. The Apis bull was entombed in a gigantic stone sarcophagus, copiously inscribed. Sepulchres were large and elaborate. One hundred sixty-five chapters of the Book of the Dead were published in a fixed order as "The Book of Going Forth by Day." A few changes may be attributed to Aegean trade and the Assyrian invasion. Some of the pottery imitated the Greek amphorae in which wine and oil were imported. Iron was now smelted in Egypt and had supplanted bronze for most practical purposes. Several iron devices were introduced by the Assyrians, notably ferrules, the saw with teeth pointing alternately in different directions, and a 25</page><page sequence="26">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY long, straight file. It is probably in this period that the Evil Eye, a supernatural concept widespread in the Near East, began to worry the Egyptians. Camels also may have been introduced, though they were certainly very rare. 525-332 BC DYNASTIES XXVII-XXX 193 YEARS Though the two centuries following the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses are usually called the Persian Period, the contemporary foreign influences were less Iranian than Hellenic. The oriental conquerors looked down on Egyptian civili- zation, not up to it like the Libyans and Ethiopians, and their intolerant, oppres- sive policies deterred the natives from adopting Persian habits. Only a few minor innovations have been attributed directly to Persia: the refining of gold, the introduction of a species of lotus (Nelumbium speciosum) and perhaps certain legal provisions in the marriage contract, including a property settlement and the right of the wife to divorce on grounds of "hatred." From Persian the Egyptian language derived several names for foreign peoples and a handful of military and administrative terms. Greek influence, on the other hand, was fostered by the commercial, diplo- matic, and military relations which had begun under the Saites. Large colonies of Greek traders had settled in northern Egypt, and thousands of Greek mercen- aries were fighting for Egypt against the Persians. Native artists and craftsmen began to imitate Hellenic styles. Pottery of Greek form and decoration, vessels of lead, and garments draped after the Greek fashion, suggest extensive modi- fications in the material life. A far more epoch-making innovation entered the economic field. After the year 400 the pharaohs paid their Greek mercenaries in gold coin. A society which had got along without money for thousands of years was thus infected for the first time with the virus of finance. The Saites them- selves, for all their zeal to revive ancient Egyptian culture in its purest form, had opened the way for the Hellenization of Egypt after Alexander's conquest and her economic subjugation by Rome. CONCLUSIONS A graph of Egypt's cultural history may assume various patterns according to the criteria we choose as measures of progress. The total inventory of mate- rials, implements, techniques, artistic forms, social institutions, rituals, and dogmas seems to have been richest in the Saite or Persian times, for the Egyp- tians of this era drew ideas from their whole recorded past and were receiving many innovations from abroad. Artistic originality was highest in the first three dynasties, in the Twelfth, and in the Eighteenth; artistic and technical skill in the 26</page><page sequence="27">DYNASTIC EGYPT Pyramid Age; the quantity and variety of artistic production from the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties inclusive. Literary and scientific activity seems to have reached its zenith in the Twelfth Dynasty, though this impression may be due to selective factors in our data. Religion developed most rapidly in the Old Kingdom and the Eighteenth Dynasty, but certain of its aspects grew more exuberantly in other periods-priesthood in the Nineteenth Dynasty, mortuary practices in the Sixth, Eleventh and Twenty-first. The general lesson to be learned is that the various departments of culture show little correlation in their progress. In particular we should beware of confusing virtuosity, elaboration, and mass productivity. The work of craftsmen tended to deteriorate rather than to improve when they acquired new techniques and materials or tried to satisfy a larger market. The course of Dynastic civilization followed no chronological rhythm. Four periods of high cultural achievement-Dynasties III-V (2980-2625), Dynasty XII (2000-1788), Dynasty XVIII (1580-1350), and Dynasty XXVI (663-525) -stand out clearly as separate and distinct phenomena, not the consecutive phases in a single evolution. Each of these developed after an era of disturbance: the first after the wars betyeen Upper and Lower Egypt that ended in their union; the second after a social revolution following the breakdown of the monarchy; the third after the Hyksos invasion; the fourth after the dissolution of the Em- pire and the intrusion of Ethiopian and Libyan kings. This intervening phase, however unstable and unproductive in itself, contributed in various positive ways to the spectacular growth that followed, and led up to it through a formative period of varying length-400 years for the First and Second Dynasties, 160 years for the Eleventh, a few decades for the Seventeenth, and 60 years for the Twenty- fifth. The era of disturbance was therefore a transition from one cultural phase to another, not an interruption in an otherwise continuous progress. The civilization was closely integrated with Egypt as a land and a nation. Tribal peculiarities had been almost dissolved in national unity before the Pyramid Age. Local peculiarities remained in force, based on differences in physical environment between the Nile and the Delta and on the ancient social and religious autonomy of the townships, but they contributed to the total civilization rather than dividing it into local units. A native of any township could travel from the Cataracts to the Great Green and still feel that he was in his own country. With the barbarians beyond these boundaries he was ready to exchange merchandise but not ideas. Though Egypt had imported a great variety of mate- rials from Asia and the Aegean since prehistoric times, and copied Asiatic tools, weapons, and mechanical techniques very extensively after the Hyksos invasion, 27</page><page sequence="28">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY she derived from abroad few intellectual concepts and no major innovations in art, religion, or social organization. She thus presents a striking contrast to the eclectic cultures of Arabia and the rest of the Near East. Her insular character resulted from her close economic adjustment to the Nile, her geographical iso- lation between two deserts, and the cultural poverty of her immediate African neighbors. Long after her intellectual life had been Hellenized, the same charac- ter reasserted itself in the rise of Coptic nationalism. Perhaps the xenophobic spirit of the modern Egyptians is a similar manifestation in political guise. Within the limits of this essay it is possible to mention only a few of the traits that remained constant throughout Dynastic history. Many of the economic features were predetermined by Egypt's position in a narrow, fertile valley, flooded once a year, between deserts of limestone and sandstone, and by the basic agricultural and industrial legacy which had proved adequate since predynastic times. The use of sun-dried brick instead of baked brick, for example, or of plaster and mortar made of gypsum instead of limestone, is the direct result of the scarcity of fuel. Since we are now concerned primarily with cultural change, we shall overlook all the features that were held constant by the physical environment, and consider only certain stable elements which owe their stability to no such constraint. The symbolic system that reached its full development in the hieroglyphic writ- ing, the rigid iconography and draftsmanship, and the architectural symbolism of the Pyramid Age, was maintained almost intact for more than three thousand years. Offhand I can think of no case where a similar complex has changed so little in so long a time. Chinese symbolism offers an analogy, but the system as devel- oped under the Shang and Chou was vastly amplified by Buddhism; it was not as closely affliliated with graphic art as was the Egyptian system, and the word- signs lost their pictorial value when written by brush. The conservatism of the Egyptian symbolic complex may be attributed to the organized clergy, whose members controlled the work of scribes, artists, and architects; to the concept of physical durability as essential for personal immortality; and to the preva- lence of stone as a medium for religious art. Though stone imposes few restric- tions on artistic form, stone masonry and sculpture were very costly and could be executed most economically by following well-established rules. Since their primary function was symbolic rather than esthetic, a block of polished granite weighing several tons would scarcely be delivered to an imaginative virtuoso to chisel according to his fancy. All formal details of the piece were dictated by convention, leaving the artist free to show his skill only in their arrangement and in the subtle variations of modelling which distinguish good work from bad. 28</page><page sequence="29">DYNASTIC EGYPT Hierglyphs, iconography, and artistic canons were thus handed down together through many generations of craftsmen. Deities seem to have been identified more consistently by their symbols than by their personal traits or their mythical and moral functions. This is indicated by the ease with which they merged with each other to form triads, enneads, or composite solar divinities. We look in vain for any philosophical rationale behind this bewildering habit. It often had a political motive, to support the home-god of the ruling family or a certain college of priests. Apparently it did not disturb the devotee as long as he could still recognize the symbols of the deity, both graphic and ritualistic. Perhaps it was the overwhelming dominance of sym- bolism that prevented the Egyptians from creating a mythology as rich as that of the Greeks, or a religious philosophy as profound as that of the Semites or the Hindus. One might also argue that it was the association of writing-both hieroglyphic and hieratic-in the complex of religious symbolism that inhibited its use in legal documents and personal correspondence. Though a large minority of the Egyp- tians were literate, they very seldom sent letters to each other or wrote contracts, receipts, and bills of sale such as were produced so commonly in the contem- porary societies of Western Asia. Most of the documents that are not purely religious have a quasi-religious context-royal monuments, temple accounts, moral stories, medico-magical treatises, and so on. We too often think of the ancient Egyptians as a nation of mummies. View- ing them in the rigor mortis of their tombs and denuded temples, we forget that they worked hard to make their livings, and that in their moments of relaxation they wore flowers in their hair, enjoyed acrobatic dancing, and got very drunk. Nevertheless, it would be vain to deny that they devoted an extraordinary amount of attention to the cult of death. This impressed many of their Greek and Roman visitors, from Herodotus on, and my notes on changes in mortuary practice make it evident for earlier times. While the essentials of the cult remained constant, artistic and technical details varied profusely. The pattern of a coffin, or the embalming and trappings of a mummy, can be assigned almost without question to the space of a few decades. In no other field did styles change so rapidly. This shows a great popular interest in mortuary fashions-an interest which seems to have been encouraged and exploited by a professional group. Fashions in funerals followed wealth and social rank, particularly after the First Inter- mediate Period, when commoners began to be buried with the royal rites of Osiris. The fact that the cult of death never became ancestor worship is another indication that kinship and inheritance were relatively unimportant in the social 29</page><page sequence="30">30 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY scheme. But if we take the modern materialistic view, and interpret Egyptian funerals only as a means of "conspicuous consumption" for gaining prestige, we overlook the doctrines of resurrection and moral justification which had moti- vated the Osiris cult since the Old Kingdom. The Egyptians were afraid to die. They believed that personal immortality could be ensured not only by symbolic rituals but by good conduct during life. This faith prepared many of the hum- blest folk, as well as a few ostentatious aristocrats, for a Gospel which offered them salvation on much the same terms.
