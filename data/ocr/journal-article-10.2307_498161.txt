<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRELIMINARY EXPEDITION TO CILICIA, 1934, AND EXCAVA- TIONS AT GOZLU KULE, TARSUS, 1935 IN THE spring of 1934 Bryn Mawr College sent an expedition to Cilicia in southern Asia Minor whose task was to be the location and preliminary study of archaeologi- cal sites lying in the Cilician plain east of the harbor town of Mersin., The Turkish government readily accorded us the permission necessary for our undertaking, which included not only the right to travel about freely but that of making soundings to- gether with the Director of the Adana Museum with a view to the eventual choice of a site for more intensive investigation. It is with the greatest pleasure that I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation of the ready help accorded us by the Turkish authorities and of the intelligent understanding with which Dr. Hamit Subeyr Kosay, Director-general of the Museums of Turkey, followed and supported our work from the very beginning. There were no misunderstandings and there were no delays. Thirty-six hours after we had left Ankara we were able to begin our reconnaissance, accompanied by Bay Halil Kamil, the then director of the Adana Museum. He remained our friendly companion and collaborator during all the work of 1934. The expedition stayed in Cilicia from April 19 until July Q5, visited forty-one sites and undertook soundings of varying length at four: the mounds of Zeytin and Kabarsa lying between Adana and Tarsus, Domuz Tepe on the east bank of the river Jeihan - the Pyramos of classic times - and Goizlii Kule on the southeast edge of the modern town of Tarsus. At Goizlti Kule we made a sounding lasting from July 1 to July Q0. This marked the final activity of the preliminary expedition of 1934.2 In view of the careful study made by Dr. Einar Gjerstad 3 of the sites visited and potsherds gathered on a similar trip of reconnaissance in Cilicia, the results of which were published while our expedition was in the field, it seems unnecessary to publish our findings for the present. When they have been studied in the light of the results obtained in the more complete excavation of Gizlii Kule, which was begun in 1935, they will form part of our final publication. EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLU KULE, TARSUS, 1935 4 Of all the mounds which rise out of the flat Cilician plain, Gdzlti Kule (Fig. 1) is by far the most impressive. It is twice as long as any other, and it alone had struc- tural remains visible on the surface before excavation took place. In its present state (Fig. 2) it measures some twenty-two meters in height at the steepest point 1 The staff consisted of Hetty Goldman, Field Director, Dr. Emil Forrer, adviser on sites, Ann M. Hoskin and Robert W. Ehrich, assistants. 2Dr. and Mrs. Forrer, who had been making soundings in Syria for Bryn Mawr College, joined us at Tarsus. 3 " Cilician Studies," R. Arch. 6, Ser. 3, 1934, pp. 155-203. 4 For the support of the campaign of 1935 Bryn Mawr College was joined by the Archaeological In- stitute of America, which had already in 1934 expressed its interest in a joint undertaking, and by Harvard University with a contribution from the Milton Fund. Miss Dorothy H. Cox made the plans and drawings, cleaned and studied the coins, and worked on the reconstruction and preliminary classification of lamps.

The north slope is gentle and as it faces toward the modern town it has been encroached upon by buildings. The same is true of the northeast where the houses FIG. 1.--G6ZLC KULE FROM THE SOUTHWEST. WALLS ON HILLSIDE MODERN reach almost to the summit of the hill. Toward the west the mound has been cut off to provide a playground for a public school and in the section of the hill thus exposed one may see Roman levels and the walls of a large building of earlier times, and gather potsherds which range from modern times to the later phases of the Bronze Age. Only the steep southern slope is unencumbered. The mound has, of course, suffered the fate of all ruins in the immediate neighborhood of a city with a con- tinuous history covering several millennia. It has been terraced for agricultural pur- poses and it has been quarried for stone. It has been used as a cemetery and pitted by the drainage systems of recent and mediaeval buildings. But during all the pre- ceding centuries it suffered no damage comparable to that inflicted upon it by the military operations of the French in 1921. Much of our time this year was spent in digging out the fill of war trenches so that it might not confuse the evidence of neighboring undisturbed areas, of removing dugouts and blasting out gun emplace- ments and concrete foundations. But here the tale of our woes ends. Many undis- of the field work and helped with the inventories. Miss Hoskin did both field work and photography, not only taking but developing all our pictures, and Mr. Ehrich combined field work with the duties of anthropologist and foreman. Bay R.

He was most helpful to us in far more ways than his official duties required and I take this opportunity of thanking him.</page><page sequence="3">528 HETTY GOLDMAN turbed areas can still be found and the core of the mound is sound. It has already yielded an unexpectedly large amount of fine material from Islamic 1 to late Bronze Age and toward the end of the 1935 campaign we isolated an area at the very sum- mit of the mound where the stratification begins directly under the surface with about the first millennium B.C. The scientific purpose of our work, that of establishing the cultural sequence in the Cilicia of prehistoric times, is thus assured of success in future campaigns. A large Islamic building in an excellent state of preservation and dated by Abassid and Seljuk coins has been excavated and it is only the Roman period which is at present represented by material rather than by any well-pre- served building. It is not, however, unrepresented by definite walls and levels. The remains visible on the surface before excavation were a fragment of wall, constructed of river stones laid in concrete, on the south edge of the hill and a curved /II 4 I* A ?a Wll / i?RL~~ .... .... ... . .. .... ... ...........

The enormous vaults which underlie the grounds of the American Tarsus College are sometimes identified with the ancient hippodrome. Part of the Roman wall of brick with a gateway leading to the sea is still preserved southwest of the hill and its line can be traced in a succession of irregular elevations to the south. The Turkish cemetery marked upon the plan shows the sharp return.towards the north. Its continuation is lost in the modern town. The mound of Gizlli Kule was twice dug, not with systematic excavation in view but in a search for antiquities. The British consul Barker recovered quantities of broken terracottas and some lamps in 1845 and Langlois, stimulated by the English- man's success, made a similar search for figurines in 1852. The excavation of the mound has started at three points. In each case an ex- ploratory trench was first dug to a depth at which some substantial walls were 1 Islamic is used as a generic term to cover all post-Roman material. In view of the early Arab in. vasion of this region and the almost complete absence of Byzantine coins at GtizlUi Kule, it seems justified.</page><page sequence="4">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZL KULE, TARSUS, 1935 509 struck or, if there were no remains of buildings, an undisturbed stratigraphic level, and then the trench was widened following the indications of the trial trench. There was every reason to suppose that the highest point of the mound would have the most important buildings. Our first trench, Number Three 1 (2.00 m. by 30.00 m.), in charge of Mr. Ehrich was, therefore, laid out on the summit and later widened into Section A, which, before we had finished, comprised an area of six hundred and seventy-five square meters. After a fairly modern Turkish building and some frag- mentary walls of the same period had been removed it fell naturally into two parts, the southern and the northern, clearly separated by a difference in the color and quality of the earth and of the finds which went with them. To the north, that is toward the Roman town of Tarsus, Roman remains were found to a maximum depth of 8.39 m. In the upper layers they were mixed with Turkish and Arabic glazed pottery, but at about 5.20 m. (2.00 m. below the surface) 2 a vast quantity of FIG. 3. --PLASTER MOULD AND PLASTOLINE IMPRESSION. BEARDED HEAD TO RIGHT broken terracottas and lamps of uniform character were recovered together with plaster moulds, many of which were still in good condition. Fig. 3 shows one of the finest, which perpetuates a Hellenistic type representing either Zeus Ammon or Asclepius as he appears on coins of Pergamon. The terracottas had for the most part some flaw and the lamps were untouched by smoke or flame. The floors of two clay-lined ovens or kilns came to light. Undoubtedly we had found the site of a factory and the debris was composed partly of defective material which had been discarded, partly of unsold wares. Of the building belonging with this material nothing but the most fragmentary bits of unrelated walls were found. But aside from the ovens, two floor levels (? 5.20 m. and 5.90 m.) were isolated and broken fragments of the mosaics, plaster architectural mouldings and fresco which must once have ornamented it. While the difference in level of the floors clearly points to two buildings rather than the renewal of the pavement of a single building, there was no difference in the character of the material that accompanied the two. The absence of anything in the way of coherent walls may easily be explained by the 1 Trenches 1 and 2 were dug during the soundings of 1934. 2 All measurements, unless otherwise stated, are given in relation to the one fixed point marked on the plan.</page><page sequence="5">530 PETTY GOLDMAN fact that in this area there were no less than twenty-nine intrusions, cesspools or drainage pits of Turkish and Arab houses, which penetrated sometimes to a depth of more than four meters. The terracottas represent the products of a native workshop and so are of interest in spite of their rather poor quality. The use of worn plaster moulds doubtless ac- counts for the lack of definition in the modelling. The manner in which they were put together precluded the possibility of our finding any complete figurines. Indeed I believe that many of the pieces we found had been discarded or abandoned before they had been combined into a whole figure. The torso was made, as a rule, in two pieces, back and front separately. The head, all limbs or separate parts, such as wings or objects held in the hand, were made in individual moulds. The joining was done by means of plaster, either by hollowing out both ends of the joint or merely by scarifying the surface and filling the incisions. Terra- cottas so combined would naturally fall into their component parts at the first shock. The smooth contact surface of many of the separate arms and legs proved that they had never been joined to a body. For the most part the figurines showed no traces of paint. The vast majority were either theatrical masks or victorious charioteers and horsemen. Horses too were numerous. Our factory evidently catered primarily to the needs of the theater and the hippodrome. The lamps display a great variety of subjects. While chariot races and gladiatorial combats were represented, others seemed to be concerned with the service of the temple. A large number of deities are depicted: Artemis, Athena (Fig. 4) and Apollo of the Olympian hierarchy, Pan in a great variety of attitudes; Bacchus and the head of Helios with radiate crown; Serapis and Isis both together and singly. Of the types going back specifically to Hellenistic times for their inspiration one may mention the city goddess Tyche with turreted crown, who sits on a rock and rests her feet on the river Kydnos, represented by a swimming half-figure. Animals are very popular, especially the deer and the sacred humped bull of Isis, and are drawn with considera- ble realism. Floral and geometric designs, frequently executed with a refined touch, are also common. The lamps are all unpainted and the fabric for the most part, though not invariably, thick. The products of the factory are dated by associated coins to about the middle of the second century A.D. Below the level of the lower of the factory floors another Roman building came to light (e 6.60 m.). Toward the northeast it runs into the side of the trench but enough has been excavated to show that we have probably uncovered the foundations of a stoa. Absolutely nothing of the superstructure was preserved. In its present state it consists of one long wall running northeast-southwest (width ca.1.20 m.) for some fourteen meters and two, possibly three, cross straps. The building, while of little importance in itself, is of interest in the history of the mound for two reasons. First, because another large deposit of terracottas and lamps was found in a fill which ran partly under the long wall and partly in front of the stoa. It is this which marks the FIG. 4.-FRAGMENTARY LAMP DISK. HELMETED ATHENA</page><page sequence="6">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLU KULE, TARSUS, 1935 531 final appearance of Roman material at a depth of 8.39 m. Secondly, because, except for this fill which is in the nature of a pocket or hollow, it marks the end of the division of Section A into an older and a later deposit. Under the stoa the material in the trench becomes uniform. The terracottas and lamps of this fill form a striking contrast to those of the fac- tory in both technique and subject. In quality they are very much finer. The figu- rines are made for the most part in only two pieces. The lamps are frequently cov- ered with a good black or red glaze paint, the disks are exceedingly thin, and the subjects are executed in high relief with clear definition. Among the figurines Herakles, both as the youthful hero (Fig. 5) and as the tired bearded giant of Lysippean conception, is the god most frequently represented. Doubtless he is the Herakles-Sandon worshipped in this region. Hardly less numer- ous are the statuettes of Hermes. The fine head of Serapis (Fig. 6) is unique, but Apollo with his lyre is represented by many fragments. In a draped figure, we may see Hera and in the nude goddess with the crescent diadem, Aphrodite. Cupid as Victor with palm and wreath seems to represent an earlier and less realistic version of such figures as the triumphant charioteer with reins knotted about his waist. Cupid displaying the mask reminds us again of the theater and the real- istic figure of a man (Fig. 7) with emaciated body and overlarge head wearing only a Phrygian cap and loin cloth may well be a Mime dancer impersonating a slave.' Fig. 8 shows a bust of a young girl of peculiar and rather touching loveliness. It is set in a medallion which forms the center of a temple pediment. We have portions of the supporting columns and stylobate. Similar representations of temples are by no means rare among our terracottas but of no other have we the tympanum preserved and none equals this one in fineness of execution. It seems nearer to the medallions of silver vessels. The large masks found in such numbers in the factory debris are entirely wanting. Fig. 9 illustrates a vitreous glaze vase of which only the base is completely missing. There were numerous fragments, both here and in Trench Six, of the green glaze ware which has long been associated with Tarsus. The miniature clay disk, Fig. 10, shows a Herakles head of well-known Hellenistic type. It appears on coins of Aegaea of the second and first centuries B.C. I had first thought of an impression from an intaglio gem, but the coarseness of the ear in contrast to the delicacy of the rest of the cutting makes this doubtful. The lamps from this fill belong for the most part to types that can be illustrated in many parts of the Roman Empire. Hermes hurrying along with his caduceus and his money bags (Fig. 11), Zeus with his eagle, a composition of hieratic dignity which seems to foreshadow Byzantine compositions, the playful Cupid (Fig. 1o) and the Cupid as Herakles (Fig. 13) are all well-known types. The running deer is repre- sented at Tarsus in innumerable examples, so that one would like to think of it as a local product. The monkey eating grapes (Fig. 14A), of which the Metropolitan Museum has an example from Cyprus, and the bird pecking fruit (Fig. 14B) illustrate the delightful genre subjects of which Tarsus yielded a great variety. The evidence of the coins found in the fill points quite consistently to the first centuries B.C. and A.D. After the material has been studied it will doubtless be possi- 1 I owe the suggestion to Professor Bieber.</page><page sequence="7">FIG. 5.--YOUTHFUL HERAKLES WEARING A CROWN OF LEAVES AND HOLDING A PATERA IN His R., CLUB IN L.

The bulk of it must, for the present, remain unil- lustrated. This is especially true of the vases which have not been mended; they include, however, in support of the suggested date, a number of stamps in planta pedis. In sinking the foundations of the stoa, the walls of an early house which lay to the west were partially destroyed. At present only one long wall exists, the western, and that not in its full original length, and a cross wall, also incomplete, with a doorway (0 5.65 m. at doorway). Two floor levels were found and underneath, the fragmentary wall of a still earlier build- ing of which part of the floor and a stone door socket were preserved. It was im- portant as the source of our first painted pottery (Fig. 15), a jug of Syrian affiliations. The north end of the area was left at the stoa level. To the south a soft fill contain- ing a kind of plain pottery with heavy wheel marks of brownish yellow clay - perhaps drab would best describe the sad impression it makes upon the eye - reached practically from the surface to a depth of roughly six-meters. No walls and no floor levels were found in this fill. The Roman buildings must have backed against it. Two theories are possible. Either the Romans cut through the fill on the south side in order to create a level space for their buildings or the fill itself was piled up by the Romans when they dug their founda- tions. I incline to the former theory because of the absolutely uniform ceramic content. Had it been created in Roman times some contemporary refuse must, I think, have entered into its composition. It is all the more apparent that this deep deposit without structures must be an artificial fill from the fact that directly to the east about three meters to three fifty under the bench mark and only about two meters under the soil we found, shortly before the excavations closed, the remains of a very large building I with heavy walls, 1.20 m. in width, partly of unburned brick and partly of drylaid broken stone. Of this we have excavated part of one large room and an adjoining smaller room with cement floor, labelled provisionally the bathroom. The pottery here is precisely the same in character as that of the fill. Shapes recovered thus far include a lentoid flask with a single handle, resembling some found in Cyprus and Ras Shamra in late Bronze Age context, shallow bowls and plates, and narrow-necked jugs. Nothing more can be said before the material has been mended. Some of the plates have in- cised symbols which resemble Hittite hieroglyphs (Fig. 16). We are not as yet in a position to date the pottery with any accuracy and I have chosen 1000 B.C. as a mean date although some of the evidence, like that of the flasks, points to a somewhat FIG. 15.-NARROW-NECKED JUG WITH MATT PAINTED ORNAMENT.

IMPRESSION OF B Iron Age pottery, very few pieces were in well stratified areas. The largest amount came from the fill of a war trench. Likewise in the earth about one meter above our house (0 ?.00 m.) and in connection with a fragmentary wall, appeared the post- Hittite seal (Fig. 17 b, c) of red porphyry with hieroglyphs on both of the convex sides.' From between the west wall of the three-meter-level house and the drain which carried off the water from the "bathroom" came one of the most important finds made this year at Tarsus. It is a bulla (Fig. 18) showing the impression of a type of seal known so far only from the Hittite capital at Boghaz Keui. In the raised center are four Hittite hieroglyphs and around it a cuneiform inscription. Dr. Gelb, who saw the bulla after the Tarsus finds had been transported to Adana, read it as follows: I - pu - (destroyed) - u- lugal - gal -dunu (or dumu) - iz - ri- ia - wa - at- ri IJ-pu-x-su, The Great King, son of Izri(i)awa(a)tri.2 The symbols or hieroglyphs he interprets as follows, beginning with the solid triangle and reading to the left: stone, King, seal, Tarhuns (or Shantash). While the name of lAll of the Tarsus seals were dated for me by Dr. von der Osten from photographs of plastoline im- pressions and of the stones themselves. 2Dr. Gelb draws my attention to the possibility of identifying this ruler with the Isputahsu, King of Kizwatna, who entered into an agreement with the Hittite King, Telepinu (Gtiterbock, MDOG 73, p. 33). Kizwatna could therefore be identified with Cilicia. The date of Telepinu seems early for our bulla. Possibly a later King of the same name. We are in need of further documentary evidence.</page><page sequence="11">536 HETTY GOLDMAN Izri(i)awa(a)tri is not known from the Hittite annals, it seems possible that we have here the seal impression of a Hittite Great King. Given the well-attested Hittite conquest of Cilicia, the piece may have been sent from the capital to the governor or prince of the subject city. It could not have been attached to a document, as the conical end is not pierced for the passage of a cord. The other possibility, that a local Cilician ruler assumed the title of Great King, would have far reaching historical implications. If the relative position of these two seals is of significance we would get 1900 B.C. as a post quem date for the layer directly under the soil-the two meter level-and for the three meter level-that of our large building-one between the date of the conquest of Cilicia and the fall of the great Hittite empire around 1200 B.C. Returning now to that part of section A which lies more directly south of the Roman stoa, we find at the edge of the hill a heavy terrace wall of large broken stones (width 1.50 m.) with straps running out from the southern face. At the base of the wall to the north there was a covered drain and remnants of a pebble pavement. Undoubtedly this represents a street. While the terrace wall itself was preserved for a length of only 8.50 m., its course could be followed some meters further toward the east by a band of soft earth of about the same width and aligned with it. This is the fill of a trench left after the stones had been removed. The terrace wall and accompanying street ran uphill from west to east. This wall was removed in order to trace the course of an earlier one (Fig. 19) (E 5.80 m.), a part of which had appeared in trial trench Two A of the 1934 soundings. Unlike the wall at the higher level this one runs an even course for over twenty meters. At present it disappears into an unexcavated area toward the east. It forms the back of a building unit which centers around a paved court. Rooms A and B have access to it by means of staircases. To the east of C there is another partially excavated room, D, connected with C by a doorway, but probably a later addition. Toward the FIG. 18.-CONICALBULLA.

Undoubtedly it was for agricultural use. Room A evidently had an inner staircase which led to a second story. Three stone steps are in situ and the line of brick wall of which the foundation remains must have supported the continuation in wood of the upper flight of steps. Of this room, which had suffered a powerful conflagration, nothing more can be recovered than what already appears on the plan, as both the north and west walls have been destroyed by war trenches. It is difficult to say what the circle of stones in the court represents, possibly the base of a water container or silo. The pottery from this complex has not yet been studied, but at least two pieces have Hittite parallels. One is only a fragment of polished red ware, the other a large rectangular tub (Fig. 20) ending below in a pithos-like base. The shelf-like protrusion which belongs inside is shown on the edge of the vessel. It was found in unburned earth about 0.40 m. above the burned fill of Room A. It may therefore be somewhat later than the contents of the room itself. Dr. von der Osten tells me that there are similar tubs from Alisar, but without the pointed base. A steatite cylinder seal (Fig. 21) was found near it. It depicts a kneeling harper surrounded by animals: a lion, a goat, two scorpions opposed and a horse (?) with hobbled feet and a bird perched on its back. One thinks of some form of the Orpheus legend. It may be dated around 1000 B.C. Room E of a house lying to the north of this complex was covered by the angle of wall belonging to the "bathroom" of the three meter building. Its floor was practically one meter under that of the bath. It contained a mass of broken pottery out of which we were able to reconstruct more or less completely sixteen shapes. Figs. 22 and 23 represent the best preserved pieces. It is my present opinion that this pottery probably belongs to the late Bronze Age, not only because of its strati- graphic relation to the building of the three meter level, but because it corresponds in character to the pottery found during our 1934 soundings at the highest level of such mounds as Zeytin and Kabarsa which ceased to be inhabited at the end of the Bronze Age.' Before leaving Section A mention must be made of two seals of typical Anatolian shapes and patterns (Figs. 24b, 17a), which came from disturbed areas. The second of our trenches, Number Four, which later developed into an area of about four hundred and fifty square meters was started on the southern slope, somewhat to the west and just below the only completely level space on the present top of the hill. It was in charge of Miss Hoskin. Our first cut, measuring two by seventeen meters, lay, unfortunately, directly in the line of a war trench, except for a small undisturbed area toward the northwest where some dressed wall blocks were found in situ. Abandoning the rest of the trench when it had reached the level of a broad foundation of modern concrete, the lead of these stones was followed toward the west. They proved to be part of a circuit wall (Fig. a5) of at least three periods which, with slight interruptions, was traced for a length of about fifty-six meters. 1 At Kabarsa there was also a later settlement, but not at the top of the mound itself. It occupied a lower level. Zeytin is the Kestelin Hiiyiigii of Dr. Gjerstad's catalogue of sites.</page><page sequence="13">FIG. '21. --IMPRESSION OF STEATITE CYLINDER SEAL.

In this campaign no attempt was made to follow its eastern course. In spite of the fact that much of it has been cut off by the war trench I do not doubt that at least patches of it could be picked up in this direction. The description of the wall follows its course from east to west. At its present eastern end the wall is composed, for a length of eight meters, of two rows of squared blocks, backed by a carefully laid line of broken stone. In front ran a drain, masked to the south by a thin wall of well-cut blocks, probably of FIG. 25.- GENERAL VIEW OF CIRCUIT WALL, SECTION 4. IN THE FOREGROUND A VWAR TRENCH somewhat later construction. The continuation of the wall to the west is composed wholly of uncut stone and the purpose of this patch of cut blocks is not clear. At the point where the section of dressed blocks ends, a drain running north-south abuts on the wall and a larger drain, with similar orientation but no present connec- tion with the wall, lies somewhat east of it. It was the source of some interesting pottery and terracotta figurines. Although this wall has a thickness of slightly less than two and a half meters and a well-defined face to north as well as to south, it is not, in my opinion, a complete structure in itself but only the outer line of a double wall. One meter seventy to the north a small piece of the inner line is still preserved, measuring only ninety centi- meters in width. No remains of a rubble fill were found, which is not surprising as only the lowest course is still standing. This gives for the original circuit wall a</page><page sequence="15">540 HETTY GOLDMAN width of approximately four and a half meters. At twelve meters a broad platform of flat stones connects the two walls. I take it to be the foundation for a gate. This was later overlaid by a diagonal wall of broken stone, among which lay embedded a bit of the fluted shaft of a column of either the Ionic or the Corinthian order. It is crudely cut and looks late. At a still later period, a concrete wall in which layers of small river stones were regularly laid was poured against the face of the diagonal wall four and a half meters from its start. Two chambers of this wall were found intact, the third was broken off by a modern trench. It was the outer face of one of these chambers which showed on the surface. This concrete structure seems to have been in the nature of a patch to repair a breach, for some eleven meters to the west we picked up a piece which corre- sponded in width (1.70 m.) and construction with the diagonal wall and agrees in alignment with the concrete patch. Overlying the whole area of this defensive system was a Roman cemetery. We opened fifty- three graves in this region and three more of a similar type in the southwest corner of Section A. It therefore seems probable that this cemetery at one time stretched along the whole southern edge of the hill. The graves were of three kinds: pithoi, tile graves (Fig. 26) and cists with cover slabs usually of stone but sometimes of tiles. The vast majority belonged to the second class. These graves varied much in the care with which they were constructed, but the best consisted of from three to four pairs of flat roof tiles set on edge to form a long tent. The ends were closed by similar tiles and the ridge by small curved cover tiles. Many of the tiles were stamped n E. The graves were not rich: an occasional bronze bracelet and more frequently a glass bottle composed the funeral furniture. The best of these, from Grave Three, is a moulded vase of yellow glass with iden- tical heads in Janus arrangement. In the same grave was a coin, pierced for sus- pension, with the head of Constantine the Great, and a small bronze bell. While an object so small as a coin could easily have sifted into the grave with the earth, the fact of its having been worn makes it more probably the property of the little boy in the grave. The coins found in connection with this cemetery show that it was in use during the second and third centuries of our era and the evidence of the lamps points to the same period. We are thus provided with an approximate ante quem date for the wall which the graves either overlay or broke. Before leaving this region mention must be made of the earliest of all the walls. It is of crude brick and runs in a straight line under the drain forming the south- ern edge of the section with cut blocks. It then bridges the space of the diagonal wall and disappears again in part underneath the southern face of the concrete FIG. 66.--TILE GRAVES FROM THE ROMAN CEMETERY, SECTION 4</page><page sequence="16">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLQ KULE, TARSUS, 1935 541 repair. It cannot possibly have been a circuit wall, as it is only sixty centimeters thick and has more the appearance of an enclosure wall for a court or garden. I illustrate a few of the finds from this region because of their intrinsic interest. They have little stratigraphic significance. The comic actor (Fig. 97) came from the fill of the con- crete chambers, which, at a lower level, were the source of our only authentic Attic piece: the fragment of a "Kleinmeister" kylix. The anthro- pomorphic lamp (Fig. 98), unique among our finds, and the lamp disk (Fig. 29) came from south of the wall and the charming "Aphrodite" (Fig. 30) from just below the war fill of our original trench. By far the most important find from this region was, however, a Babylonian cylinder seal (Fig. 31). It lay just north of Grave Nine.' It is a dedication of one Parisul to Ninsubur, minister or priest of Anna, goddess of heaven. Ninsubur is an Uruk deity. It probably dates from the years between Hammurabi and the Kassite occupation. An extension of Section Four made towards the north measured roughly ten by fifteen meters. In spite of much disturbance it was possible to isolate definitely an Islamic and a Hellenistic level represented by both buildings and pottery. The intervening Roman level is less clearly defined. Directly under the surface were recent burials, some probably as recent as the world war; also fragments of modern houses. The first important structure was a long wall, of broken stone and tile in poured cement, running approximately east-west and averaging about a meter in width (0 9.30 m.). This was un- covered for a length of ten meters. In front, unevenly spaced but about two meters to the north, stood a row of roughly circular piers of construction similar to that of the wall. Of these, six were uncovered. They seem, however, to continue into the undug sides of the trench and may represent the founda- tions of one side of an arcaded street of Islamic FIG. 31.-IMPRESSION OF CYLINDER SEAL OF RED AND WHITE MARBLE.

To the absolute level of about ten and a half meters can be assigned a well (1.00 m. by 1.00 m.) beautifully built of fitted stone slabs and provided on all sides with toe- holes for descent. It was excavated for a depth of twelve meters but is undoubtedly much deeper. To have struck a source of water it must have cut into the soil under- lying the artificial accumulation of the hill. Around it there were traces of a pebble 1 This seal was kindly read for me by a number of scholars, but Dr. Gelb is the only one who has seen the original.

I judge that the well lay in a court or street to the west of the building now represented by this wall. At the same level we found a curved drain of unusually fine stone and cement construction which ran sharply downhill towards the southwest. For the present, on the evidence of pottery, I assign the level at ten and a half meters to the Roman period. While there was some admixture of later ma- terial the bulk of the sherds were Roman. Directly underlying the drain and at an average depth of eleven and a half to twelve meters lay a bath (Fig. 32) of Hellenistic (late. It seems to be part of a very large complex, more of which appears in Section Five to the north. It is a rectangle (0.06 m. by 2.84 m.) of fine concrete with a pinkish cement surface. At one small point it is preserved to its original height of fifty-five centimeters above a bevelled edge which runs around the base. This bevel is inter- FIG. 3,. --HELLENISTIC BATH IN SECTION 4.

The tub itself (0.90 m. by 0.60 m.) is of the type already in use at Olynthos before 438 B.C., with a seat and a circular depression for the feet of the bather. There was</page><page sequence="18">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLQ KULE, TARSUS, 1935 543 no drain from the tub into the cemented room nor from the small tank in the other corner. On two sides parts of a supporting wall of clay on a stone foundation came to light and a wall of broken stone two and a half meters to the south seems, by level, alignment and dimensions to belong to the bath complex. The well from the upper level broke through it at this point. The north part of the area was left at this level as we hope in the next campaign to connect it with remains of the same build- ing in Section Five. Toward the south, however, we continued to deepen the trench. The next level of stratigraphic importance is that of a wall at about e 14.A5 m. to (D 14:50 m. of which the accompanying ceramic material belonged almost exclu- sively to the Cypriote Iron Age. It has not as yet been studied sufficiently to de- fine the period more closely. This wall rests upon another of crude brick and illustrates the closeness of the successive building levels. Just below, and in what appeared to be an undisturbed stratum, we made what is certainly from the point of view of art our most important find (Figs. 33, 34). It is a statuette of translucent crystal slightly more than six centimeters in height. It represents a beardless elderly man with deeply lined face and aquiline nose standing with feet close together and folded hands. He is clothed in a simple robe reaching to the feet and originally probably wore a conical headdress of some precious metal. Only the supporting core of crystal now exists. A slight protuberance on the left side below the waist may repre- sent the hilt of a dagger. Dr. Schaeffer, with whom I was able to discuss the statu- ette in Paris, very kindly showed me a small bronze statue of great beauty found at Ras Shamra. The headdress too was separately worked. In spite of the difficulties inherent in the material and the summary treatment of hands and feet, the statu- ette is in reality neither primitive nor crude. The surface is well worked and the curve of back and shoulders excellently indicated. The face has great character and individuality. The heavy jaw and aquiline nose look Hittite. The stratum at which it was found indicates a date shortly after 1000 B.c. but there was an intru- sion of soft earth nearby and so small an object is easily displaced. There is little in Hittite art with which to compare it except large monumental sculpture. I hope our own excavations will eventually provide the necessary comparative material. Three terracotta figurines from this region, found in intrusive earth, deserve mention.

The caricature (Fig. 36) is executed in a spirit of true comedy. The work in Section Four ended with the partial excavation of a most interesting early building. When the bottom of the war trench had been cleared, a mass of burned and fallen brick was discovered which also appeared in the vertical cutting to the north. Here it reached at one point a height of about seventy centimeters. When the debris of fallen brick had been separated from the walls it became apparent that we had struck part of a large building complex destroyed by a tremendous conflagra- tion. Huge portions of wall burned to the hardness of stone had toppled over and lay on the floor. The walls (average width 1.18 m.) are exceedingly well-built of brick on a foundation of stone. The only room completely excavated at present (Room II) FIG. 36.--MALE HEAD CARI- CATURED. INV. 163 - T~1. M.M. 0.067 m. FIG. 37.--RooM I OF EARLY HOUSE IN SECTION 4 WITH Room III IN BACKGROUND measures 4.70 m. by 3.10 m. A cemented area (c. 1.70 m. by 1.90 m.) with a very fine smooth surface slopes toward the northwest corner and is probably the floor of a bath or water tank. In the south wall there is a doorway (1.10 m. wide) with a charred wooden sill in situ. The north face of this south wall runs under the circuit wall but its width was determined by probing. To the north of Room II lay a formi- dable mass of fallen wall. As no true floor level could be found it may be either an area completely outside the house or an inner court. To the west the north-south wall showed on both sides the white dressed surface characteristic of inner walls, so that there is presumably another room (IV) in this direction. To the east we have Room I (Fig. 37), the full extent of which we cannot at present determine. It meas- ures three meters from east to west and over eight in the opposite direction, up to the point where it runs under the north trench wall. The room was entered from the east by a wide doorway (2.00 m.). To the right of the entry it was partitioned by a thin wall of which the remains of fifteen post-holes, irregularly aligned and spaced, fix the position. A screen of wattle and daub or interwoven withes is indicated. It pro- truded about one meter sixty from the western wall up to a narrow cutting in the floor which probably represents the sill of a door or opening leading from the south- ern into the northern portion of the room. Just south of the screen, a circular hollow</page><page sequence="20">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLIU KULE, TARSUS, 1935 545 about twenty centimeters deep (Diam. 0.60 m.) was surrounded by a partially preserved brick parapet. It is probably a cooking pit. The floor of the southern part was strewn with potsherds which, when collected, proved to belong to from four to five large straw-banded pithoi and a large number of plates or shallow bowls of the brownish yellow wheel-made ware char- acteristic of the three meter level house of Section A (see p. 534). One (Fig. 16, p. 535) or two were similarly incised with symbols resembling Hittite hieroglyphs. Mention should also be made of a red-slipped and burnished pot stand (Fig. 38). In the ex- cavated portion of the northern section of Room I stands a raised rectangular hearth (0.64 m. by 0.80 m.) with a depressed center. The material is crude brick. A well-defined floor level and pottery to the southeast indicate that the broad doorway led not from out of doors but from another room (Room III). Nothing can be said at present of the plan of this building except that it is irregular and that the wide shallow Room I suggests the Hilani type. Section Five, in charge of Miss Grace, was laid out to the north of Four, with which it will eventually coalesce. When the excavation closed they were separated only by the width of the railroad. The procedure was the same as elsewhere: an original trench two meters by twenty meters developed into an area of roughly three hundred and eighty square meters. Directly under the soil a number of late burials came to light but no modern buildings. At about one and a half meters FIG. 38.--RED SLIPPED AND BURNISHED POT STAND. INV. 1162-P805. D. 0.147 M. FIG. 39.--LARGE ISLAMIC BUILDING IN SECTION 5 FROM THE EAST</page><page sequence="21">546 HETTY GOLDMAN (e 11.00 m.) a street of the Islamic period was struck which varied very much in width but kept a fairly straight course. It ran downhill from south to north at a much sharper grade than that of the present slope. On the west it was bordered for part of its length by a heavy wall, of a type of construction peculiar to the buildings of this period. Large cut blocks were laid crosswise on a heavy foundation of stone and tile embedded in a coarse, rather powdery, black cement. Several walls ran off from it diagonally, but none of them could be connected with a house construction. They may have marked the boundaries of open lots or gardens. At certain points clay pipes passed through the wall which bounded the street and emptied into deep drainage pits built directly against it. As a rule these have the appearance of a truncated oval in section and are lined with thin bricks in regular courses. Many were closed at the top by a beehive construction of the same material. To the east lay the large Islamic building (Fig. 39) in connection with which, as indeed with the whole area at this level, numerous Abassid and a few Seljuk coins were found. In the construction, tile, stone and mortar were used and a great deal of cement on the floors. This seems frequently to have been added as a resurfacing after the flags in the room were worn hollow. The building measures approximately 12.70 m. by 9.70 m. It was entered by a doorway (width 1.80 m.) which led into a short corridor with small rooms at either side and a large one at the end. A piece of reused marble moulding served as a sill. The room to the right had a cemented floor and a tank-like arrangement in the corner, while the one to the left had no distinguishing features FIG. 40.--HELLENISTIC BUILDING WITH EARLIER WALLS BELOW. SECTION 5, FROM THE EAST</page><page sequence="22">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZL IKULE, TARSUS, 1935 547 except the wide double door by which it was entered. The large room at the end of the corridor had an elaborate succession of water containers and drains. Against the north wall there was a circular brick-lined structure with a depth of about ninety centimeters. Directly in front of it but in no way connected stood a built-in tank full of a rather greasy black substance. It was followed by a covered tile drain which ran the whole width of the room and evidently received the water or other liquid which overflowed successively from the circular and rectangular containers. A pot full of black coloring matter was also found near the house. I think our building must have been a dyer's establishment. We decided to leave it as a well-preserved monument of the Islamic period and to carry the excavation further only in the area to the west. At a depth of about two meters below the soil (e 11.50 m.), a Roman level was distinguished on the basis of ceramic evidence. Some walls of no great interest, but which give the broken outline of a rather large room, belong to this period. This whole region was dug by Miss Grace with great care, as we have here a better stratification from Roman to Hellenistic times than elsewhere. The Hellenistic level followed close upon the Roman and was indeed often disturbed by the buildings of the later period. There was a great deal of reusing and heightening of walls. A very large building (Fig. 40), standing in places to a height of over 1.5 m., now fills the major portion of the trench and continues under its sides in two directions. Imme- diately below but with a different orientation another wall complex is appearing. The pottery which has come from this level is of great interest as it shows relations with the interior of Asia Minor and with the islands. It is illustrated in figures 41 to 43. The high-stemmed dish of so-called Bucchero (Fig. 41) is paralleled most closely in Samos, the kylix (Fig. 42) in Rhodes and the side-spouted pitcher (Fig. 43) in Phrygia, although examples of the last type have been found rather far afield. The Metropolitan Museum has a pot of similar shape from the excavations at Sardis. All three vessels suggest the same approximate date: late seventh to sixth centuries B.C. Consistent too with this dating are the fragments of kylikes of a very thin black-glaze FIG. 41. - BUCCHERO HIGH- STEMMED DISH, DESIGN OF LOTUS IN RED AND WHITE ON INTERIOR. CLAY, LIGHT GRAY.

Very little has as yet been done here, but the number and variety of the restorable pieces already acquired promises well for the future. A problem, too, raises its head. No- where on the hill have we found any material which could be assigned to the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Figures 44 to 46 represent individual finds from this trench. The bird on the Islamic sgraffito bowl (Fig. 44) is drawn with great boldness and verve. The Arab doll (Fig. 45) of carved bone is probably of the tenth century A.D. according to the dating of similar objects in the Benaki Museum at Athens. A great deal of fine FIG. 44.--DEEP SGRAFFITO BOWL. DESIGN: BIRD TO R. INV. 644--P72.

Two of these vases have inscriptions in the square Cufic lettering. Fig. 46 is one of a number of similar figurines usually found in Cypriote Iron Age context, although the specimen illustrated came from intrusive earth. The feline on the triangular seal or amulet of Fig. 24a -is it our domestic cat? - is incised in very effective shorthand. Dr. von der Osten informs me that, although of an archaic type, this example belongs to a somewhat degenerate form current in North Syria between about 1000 and 600 B.C.

It is thirty-six meters long, four and one half to five and one half meters wide, and approximately level on top. It stands to a maximum height of three meters on the north face. The whole forms an arc with a radius of about forty-five meters. On the north side a vaulted entrance now choked with stones is visible above the slope of the hill and there seems to be a corresponding hollow on the other side. The concrete mass is best explained as the back wall of the auditorium of a theater and the vault as one of the passages by which the cavea was reached. It was impossible to give more time to this excavation, but we hope to carry it further in a future campaign. Lying, as it does, practically in the town, it is most unlikely that any of the superstructure can be found. All the seats and wall blocks doubtless went into the making of modern Tarsus. One of the auditors seems to have dropped his ticket, for we found it in section A. It has on one side the number four in both Greek and Latin to meet the needs of the mixed population, on the other a head in profile, possibly a mask. We have still to speak briefly of Trench Six, located at the base of the hill and at about the middle of the south side. It was started as an investigation preliminary to dumping earth and developed into one of the most prolific sources of pottery and figurines, chiefly of the early Roman type although later Imperial times were also represented. They were found to a depth of about five meters in fairly regular layers with earth between. This is, of course, not a stratified deposit but represents, I judge, material discarded at intervals from some building higher up which may have been a temple, as the debris included a number of small votive lamps and pots. Di- rectly above the trench the slope of the hill is gentle and could very well be the site of a building resting on a terrace foundation. The material is very fragmentary. Barker already noted the broken condition of all the figurines with the commentary that the people had broken and discarded their idols. One is struck by the resemblance of many of our types to those of Alexandria. Fig. 47 from this trench, known to the excavators as "The Cilician Pirate" is an example of quite extraordinary and brutal realism. The use of plaster moulds is also best paralleled in Egypt. Perhaps, in view of the interest in the "Achaean problem" of this region a word should be added about pottery of Mycenaean type. A very few fragmentary pieces, including the necks of two stirrup vases have turned up in unstratified areas as well as some pieces of local imitation. If there is a "Mycenaean" level it has not yet been reached. HETTY GOLDMAN NOTE.-A reading and interpretation of the bulla mentioned on page 536, by Professor A.
