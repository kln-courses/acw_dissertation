<plain_text><page sequence="1">DigitalMandala, video installation created by Art Nomura, 1994, 18 minutes. Art Nomura's DigitalMandala is a chal lenging computer-generated video installa tion that uses the mandala as a structural device to represent the complex relation ships between all the elements that con nect us in our universe. To understand the relationship of Nomura's work to the tech nological advances that enabled this video installation to be created, one must trace a long and rich history of the mandala as a universal archetypal form. The mandala is a universal pattern that has continually appeared in human artworks, constructions, and rituals. M?ndalas con sist of series of circular, mirrored, and concentric forms suggestive of a passage between different dimensions. These mul tiple dimensions evoke a totality that spans the entire time, space, and thought continuum. To represent this totality, DigitalMandala defines seven broad groups, each depicted by a section of the video work: "Celestial Landscape," "People," "Water Cycle," "Fauna," "Flora," "Machines and Other Man-Made Things," and "Conflict." The imagery is an eclectic and comprehensive blend of original and archival video and film footage, computer-generated graph ics, and animation. Nomura explains the importance of the mandala: "The circular form of the mandala is part of many reli gions and cultures. Examples included the Aztec sun calendar, the French cathedral windows of the twelfth century, and the ancient rock arrangement at Stonehenge. " DigitalMandala is meant to be seen pro jected downward or upward on a circular disc 15 to 18 inches wide. If it is projected upward, 12 chaise lounges are radially and symmetrically arranged around a pyr amid (the projector) for viewing. It is ideal to view DigitalMandala in a large-scale environment, when the kinetic quality of the mandala absorbs the viewer's field of vision. This spatial and temporal absorption pro vokes a meditative and quasi-religious ex perience that isolates the audience from other elements in the room. The luminous quality of the video projection emanating from the screen into the dark room ap proaches the sublime. Nomura asserts that the experience becomes "almost like a religion." In its formal structure and intent, Digital Mandala achieves an effect analogous to that of Barnett Newman's monumental paintings, but Nomura enlarges on the impact by exploring the kinetic quality of the mandala?enhancing the hypnotic effect of its formal construction with vi sual metaphors juxtaposed in well-defined sections. DigitalMandala follows a tradition in avant-garde film that links the abstract quality of the mandala and its circular form and concentric patterns with cosmo logical connotations, beginning with the film experiments of Oskar Fischinger in the 1920s, which inspired the experiments of graphic filmmakers Harry Smith, John and James Whitney, and Jordan Belson in the 1950s. In Visionary Film: The American Avant Garde (New York: Oxford UP, 1974), P. Adams Sitney describes Belson's 1953 film Mandala as "an object of meditation in the Oriental tradition"; James Whit ney's film Lapis (1953-66) also uses the structure and visual alignment of circular forms of the mandala. But these examples and DigitalMandala follow different con JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 47.4 (Winter 1995-96) 57</page><page sequence="2">ceptual routes. The earlier films rely solely on abstraction rooted within the tradition of modernist formalism as the means to achieve a cosmological meditative state. In DigitalMandala, by contrast, Nomura pushes abstraction further by incorporat ing representational images. This has the effect of creating a strong tension between the abstract structure and the representa tional elements. This tension, in turn, sets the stage for the complex conceptual rela tionships between the personal and the universal, the macrocosm and the micro cosm, the inner and the outer, the past and the present. For example, in the "Man Made Things" and "People" sections, visual tension is created by running people and turning wheels, juxtaposed with roam ing tigers in the "Fauna" section. Images fuse into one another by becoming ab stract patterns and then abruptly turning into recognizable pictures within the kalei doscope of the mandala. The placement of an iconic shape (the mandala) into a cosmic landscape can also be traced to Ed Emshwiller's ground breaking computer animation Sunstone (1979), which uses the iconic image of a cube floating and breathing in the cosmos after giving birth to a radiating sun, a moon, and a face. Sunstone continues the tradition of using cosmology and iconic shapes as allegories for a "mythic jour ney," to use Emshwiller's term, but, un like Belson and Whitney, Emshwiller introduces representational images?eyes, a mouth, a face, a person running. He manipulates metaphors of creation by turning an anthropomorphic stone into a face, a sun, and a moon. DigitalMandala builds upon the representational structure of Sunstone to create a more complex and dynamic system of representation, gener ating most of its images from stock and personal footage combined within the out lines of the mandala form. As opposed to Belson's plain Mandala, Nomura's DigitalMandala announces the medium by which it generates its mandala. The adjective "digital" follows the mod ernist tradition of addressing the inherent qualities of each medium in the process of making art. But does it really matter that the piece was made digitally? DigitalMan dala succeeds in advancing the use of personal computer-based technology to exploit the inherent capabilities of the medium: duplication, reshaping, anima tion, and rendering. DigitalMandala ex pands the vocabulary of traditional two dimensional artwork. As one watches DigitalMandala, one is aware of its formal and expressive means, yet these elements are camouflaged to address the complex structures of the re lationship of humans to nature, machines, the microcosm, and the macrocosm. Dig italMandala is an overall experience that must be seen, felt, and understood in stages. At each stage we absorb a different set of metaphors and allegories among all the elements. The piece has three definite parts with entrances and exits of the mandala struc ture. Each part also has a soundtrack echoing the visual relationships in musical terms. The first part is accompanied by a synthetic slow movement; the second part acquires a staccato rhythm that mimics the tension between the most vis ible sections of the piece and accentuates relationships between the animal and nat ural world versus the machine world, vi sually exemplified by birds, turning wheels, airplanes, and cars. The final mu sical movement resonates with a mecha nistic sound emphasizing the tension between the seven sections. Despite these ambitious sound-and-image relationships, however, the music is the weakest ele ment in DigitalMandala. The meditative quality would be enhanced if the video were silent, since silence has the power to enhance the sublime. Constant motifs throughout the piece are the cosmic starlike background, over which the mandala floats, and the circular 58 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 47.4 (Winter 1995-%)</page><page sequence="3">center, which shows the planets and gal axies at different times. The macrocosm is represented as being both outside and inside the mandala with those two con stants. The inside circle works as a meta phoric engine where the earth, other planets, and galaxies rotate, providing the visual and allegorical energy for our exis tence in the vast cosmos. The system of the mandala does not pro vide answers or justifications; instead, it provides a vehicle for us to see how all things are interconnected. According to Nomura, "DigitalMandala is the tangible manifestation of a greater philosophy of art and life that acknowledges the inter connectedness of all things, phenomena, and energy." What fascinates me the most about this piece is not so much the references to technologies (computer, digital) as the in terplay of cosmological and timeless ques tions about our existence. The complex compartmentalization of clearly defined images comments effectively on larger philosophical questions. As the images and sequences of events shift, we are attracted by each successive transforma tion?losing, for a moment, the informa tion from other sections. This creates the effect of a self-contained mini-movie within each compartment. The conflict between the manmade and the natural becomes apparent; then, as the sequences blend into each other, this conflict can shift suddenly from chaos to harmony. As the tensions of each section are re vealed, we come to understand the overall allegory of the piece as a series of polari ties and interconnections between all the systems; we shift from macrocosm to mi crocosm, from the individual to the vast universe, from the inside to the outside, from the past to the future. This funda mental conceptual structure is enriched by the complexity of all the systems operat ing at once. At stake in this experience is the idea of letting things take their own course. The viewer becomes part of a montage aes thetic in which shots are juxtaposed above, underneath, and to the side rather than in a linear fashion. In a sense, this aesthetic resonates with a well-known phrase by Goethe: "In nature we never see anything isolated but everything in connection with something else which is before it, beside it, under it, and over it." Goethe's observation is clearly manifested in the system of the mandala Nomura uses to visualize our complex existence in the universe. DigitalMandala thus creates an intelligent bridge between technology, art, and life where viewers become suspended for 18 minutes in the sublime experience of an archetypal system.
