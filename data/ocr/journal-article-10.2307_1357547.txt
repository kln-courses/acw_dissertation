However, a close examination of these figurines reveals that several of them carry spheres instead of frame drums. These spheres represent a type of baetyl that served as a cult image in some Cypriot sanctuaries of the Cypro-Archaic period. Therefore, the terracottas may depict participants in a funerary ritual in which a baetyl played an important role. ombs 113-367 at Amathus have yielded scores of terracotta figurines that represent a wide variety of subjects: humans, animals, carts, naiskoi, and even a putative worm (Karageorghis and Hermary 1987). Classification is relatively easy in most cases, but one group remains problematic. It consists of rather crude anthropomorphic figurines from the Cypro-Archaic period, created with the snowman technique. The noses and ears are dispro- portionately large and the eyes, mouths, and gar- ments have been rendered with paint. The absence of sexual attributes makes it difficult to determine their gender, but the necklaces and the rouge on the cheeks of some suggest that a number of them, if not all, are female (Karageorghis and Hermary 1987: 18-19). The distinguishing characteristic of this group is a relatively large round object that is held in one of three positions: perpendicular to the body, against the chest, or in front of the pelvis. Kara- georghis, like previous scholars who had studied the Near Eastern forerunners of these terracottas, iden- tified the round object as a tambourine and classified the figurines themselves as either "tambourine play- ers" or "tambourine holders" depending on the po- sition in which the round object is held. While a close examination of these figurines supports Kara- georghis' contention that many hold hoop-shaped frame drums, it also reveals that some hold a spher- ical item that may represent a type of baetyl found in Cypriot sanctuaries of the same period as these sphere-bearing figurines. It is generally agreed that Cypriot figurines that hold round objects perpendicular to the body or against the chest ultimately derive from prototypes that originated in Mesopotamia, then came to Cyprus by way of the Levant no later than the seventh cen- tury B.C. (Ferron 1969: 19-21; Opificius 1961: 54- 58; Vandenabeele 1968: 103-14; 1985: 103-211). A number of theories concerning their nature had al- ready been proposed by 1943 when J. Pritchard wrote a monograph entitled Palestinian Figurines in Re- lation to Certain Goddesses Known Through Lit- erature. He reported that others had attempted to identify the disc as a tambourine, a cake, a drum, a rattle in the shape of a drum, or a platter (Pritchard 1943: 55). Although Pritchard himself declined to identify the disc or the woman who carries it, he placed all the female figurines that hold round ob- jects in front of the chest or against the shoulder into one category that he called "Type V: figurine hold- ing disc." More than 50 years later, there is still no consensus as to the identity of the round object or the woman who holds it. Amiran believes that the disc represents the sun and, consequently, that the woman is the sun goddess (Amiran 1967: 99-100). Conversely, some have argued that the disc represents 39</page><page sequence="2">40 SHAWN O'BRYHIM BASOR 306 the moon (Brown 1991: 136-37). Lapp observed that a terracotta from Taanach carried a round ob- ject divided into quarters, so he identified it as a loaf of bread, but later reclassified it as a drum (Lapp 1964: 40; 1967: 36). Hillers insists that all round objects held by this type of figurine represent drums and suggests that the woman who holds them must be a goddess (Hillers 1970: 606-10). Bisi's study of Punic analogues led her to conclude that all the round objects are drums, but that some of the indi- viduals who hold them are human and others are divine (Bisi 1966: 5-37; 1980: 57-78). This lack of agreement stemmed in part from the assumption that these figurines are essentially iden- tical. Meyers, however, corrected this misperception when she noted that the clothing worn by the women sometimes varied and that the round objects differed in size and placement (Meyers 1987: 116-22; 1991: 16-27). Thus, she concluded that the round objects had distinct functions and that the women who held them had diverse roles. This led to the creation of two categories to replace Pritchard's all-inclusive Type V. First, there are the figurines that hold large round objects perpendicular to the body, which Meyers identified as human women holding frame drums- large, hoop-shaped objects covered with a skin on one or both sides (fig. 1). She distinguished these from the figurines that hold smaller round objects against the chest or shoulder, although she ventured no guess as to their identity (fig. 2). Both types have been found in the city of Ama- thus and in its tombs; 21 complete examples and several fragments have been recovered from Tombs 113-367 alone, while one fragment has been found in the city (Aupert 1976: 918). The discovery of large numbers of both kinds in sanctuaries throughout Cyprus led Karageorghis to suggest that they were the most popular types of figurine made on the island during the Cypro-Archaic period (Karageorghis and Hermary 1987: 18; Meerschaert 1991: 183-86). Like Meyers, he abandoned Pritchard's all-inclusive Type V and separated these terracottas into two groups: "tamborine players" (or, more accurately, "frame- drum players"), which hold their instruments perpen- dicular to the body, and "tamborine holders," which clasp round objects against the chest or shoulder (Karageorghis and Hermary 1987: 17). He also clas- sified a third type of figurine (found thus far only in the tombs of Amathus) as a "tamborine holder" even though it has a different configuration.1 It does not hold the round object perpendicular to the body as do the frame-drum players, nor does it hold it before the chest or shoulder as do the frame-drum holders. In- stead, it holds the round object in front of the pelvis (fig. 3). A close examination reveals that these figu- rines do not carry hoop-shaped drums, but spheres. Some of these have been slightly compressed with the thumb to force them to adhere to the figurines; the same method was used for attaching the drum to figurines that represent frame-drum players (Mey- ers 1987: 116-17). In a number of examples, the spheres have fallen off because they had not been pressed against the figurine firmly enough. Although this method of attachment causes them to appear somewhat flattened when viewed from the side, they nevertheless seem to be perfect spheres when viewed from the front as intended (Karageorghis and Her- mary 1987: 21). These spherical objects are neither frame drums nor tamborines; they are not the same shape as those instruments, nor are they held in the same posi- tion. Neither do they represent women who carry of- ferings of fruit; such figurines hold much smaller spheres in one hand just below the chest (Kara- georghis 1987: 703). And unlike frame drums, tam- borines, and pieces of fruit, the spheres must have represented a heavy object because they are held in both hands with the arms extended downward. These differences are sufficient to warrant the re- moval of this sphere-bearing figurine from the cate- gory of "tamborine holder" and the creation of an entirely new category to accommodate it. The identification of this spherical object is aided by an examination of analogues from the Levant. Greek and Latin authors speak of sacred stones called baetyls in connection with the Levantine cults of Zeus and Aphrodite, the Greek counterparts of Baal and Astarte. These come in a variety of shapes and sizes (Moore 1903: 198-208; Stockton 1974- 1975: 1-27; Moscati 1981: 101-5). The baetyl that stood in the temple of Baal at Emesa, for example, was a black meteorite that appears on Roman im- perial coinage as a large ovoid stone (Herodian 5.3.5; Price and Trell 1977: 167-70). Philo of Byb- los (FGrHist 790 F 1.31; Jacoby 1958) mentions a meteoric baetyl in connection with the cult of the goddess Astarte, who "found a meteorite, picked it up, and consecrated it in her holy temple in Tyre" (Baumgarter 1981: 220). This may be the sacred stone depicted on a statue from the early first century A.D. found near Baalbek, which shows the goddess seated on a throne with a spherical baetyl on her</page><page sequence="3">1997 SPHERE-BEARING ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINES OF AMATHUS 41 ! !.... ii A..

It appears that these baetyls were considered aniconic representations of deities. The Roman imperial coinage of Tyre and Sidon depicts Astarte's sacred meteorite as a sphere carried on a processional cart in a sphinx throne reserved for de- ities (BMC 23 = Poole 1873: pls. 23.9-10, 24.5-12), while a small bronze figurine from the Levant shows the spherical baetyl on the sphinx throne without the goddess (Seyrig 1959: 52-58, pl. 10).2 This suggests that the sphere alone may represent the deity. Sozo- men (Ecclesiastic History 2.5) confirms this when he says that the people of Aphaca repeated a parti- cular prayer to bring Astarte down from the top of Mt. Lebanon into a neighboring river in the form of a fiery meteorite. Further support for the identifi- cation of the goddess with the baetyl comes from spherical stones found in the tophet of Carthage. One of these is inscribed with a human face with ex- aggerated ears on one side and, on the other, with an inscription that reads "they have opened their ears." According to Ferron, this inscription indicates that the stones were dedicated to Baal Hammon and Tanit by a worshiper to thank them for hearing his prayer. Therefore, not only the face inscribed on the stone but the stone itself represents one of these deities (Ferron 1978: 95-103).3 Baetyls of various shapes and sizes have also been found on Cyprus (Sophocleous 1985: 6-12). A conical stone uncovered in the sanctuary of Aphro- dite at Golgoi (Colonna-Ceccaldi 1882: 43-45), for</page><page sequence="4">42 SHAWN O'BRYHIM BASOR 306 lott ?1?-4f PA "4 Fig. 4. Roman coin (BMC Caracalla 62) from Paphos, showing the sanctuary of Aphrodite (courtesy of the Brit- ish Museum). example, recalls the famous baetyl that stood in the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos, which is mentioned by a number of Greek and Latin authors and ap- pears on the Roman coinage of this city (Mayer and Karageorghis 1984: 99). Some issues show certain features of the Paphian temple in great detail; the conical baetyl and the thymiateria within the cella and the sacred doves, the brick pavement, and what appears to be an altar inside the fenced temenos (fig. 4). The temenos also contains three unidentified round objects. Price and Trell (1977: 147-48, fig. 266) argue that the round objects on the coinage of Paphos are places of offering or dedication. How- ever, they may represent a group of spherical bae- tyls that were secondary in importance to the conical baetyl. They may also be dedicatory offerings mod- eled on a spherical baetyl, just as small marble cones found in the Paphian sanctuary are models of the conical baetyl (Gardiner et al. 1888: 180). In either case, the spherical baetyls in the temenos represented the goddess in a form that was slightly different from the primary cult image in the temple. A similar sit- uation occurs in a number of sanctuaries where sev- eral anthropomorphic representations of a deity are venerated even though they are not identical to the primary cult image. While the identity of the round objects in the temenos at Paphos must remain un- certain, incontrovertible evidence that spherical baetyls did play an important role in Cypriot cult comes from spherical stones found in sacred con- texts at Meniko and Ayia Irini, both of which date from the Cypro-Archaic period. The spherical baetyl from the temple of Baal at Meniko finds a parallel in the black meteoric stone that served as the cult image at the temple of Baal at Emesa (Karageor- ghis 1977: 42, 44-45). The deity worshiped at the temple at Ayia Irini is unknown, but the associa- tion of spherical baetyls with Baal and Astarte in the Levant suggests that the deity could have been male or female. In any case, it is certain that the sphere served as the primary cult image; it had been anointed with oil, shows signs of burning, and orig- inally stood on an altar surrounded by more than 2000 anthropomorphic dedicatory figurines (Sjoqvist 1933: 316-17, 347-48; Gjerstad et al. 1935: 702 no. 938). While it is not possible to state with absolute certainty that the spherical objects carried by the Amathusian figurines represent baetyls, the argu- ments in support of this identification are numerous. First, these round objects are identical in shape to the spherical baetyls used in both Cypriot and Levan- tine cults. Second, the size of the sphere carried by these figurines stands in direct proportion to that of the baetyls found at Meniko and Ayia Irini. Third, the weight of the stones from Meniko and Ayia Irini require that they be held in both hands with the arms extended downward, just as they are held by the fig- urines from Amathus. Finally, the spherical baetyls from Meniko and Ayia Irini and the terracottas from Amathus all date from the Cypro-Archaic period, thus suggesting that the Amathusian figurines represent a contemporary cult practice. Theories about the ritual function of the figurines that stood around the spherical baetyl at Ayia Irini aid in explaining the significance of the Amathusian sphere bearers. Sjoqvist posited that the mounted horsemen, bulls, bull-masked priests, singers, flute players, and tamborine players from Ayia Irini rep- resent participants in a ritual that was conducted around the spherical baetyl that rested on the altar (Sjoqvist 1933: 342-48). According to Connelly, the rest of the figurines represent worshipers, who placed them in the sanctuary as surrogates to offer prayers to the deity in their absence (Connelly 1989: 210- 18). If these scholars are correct, then the purpose of the Ayia Irini figurines was to reenact in perpe- tuity a ritual that their living counterparts had once performed in the sanctuary. Since the spherical</page><page sequence="5">1997 SPHERE-BEARING ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINES OF AMATHUS 43 baetyl that was the object of the ritual stood before them, there was no need for terracotta representa- tions of it. The terracottas discovered in the tombs of Amathus are similar to those found in Ayia Irini. Terracotta worshipers, mounted horsemen, bulls, bull- masked priests, and tamborine players were placed alongside ritual items such as miniature naiskoi, thymiateria, bells, and anthropomorphic masks (Kara- georghis and Hermary 1987: 16-32). This suggests that the anthropomorphic figurines from the tombs of Amathus, like those at Ayia Irini, represent par- ticipants in a ritual (surely funerary in nature) and their accoutrements. However, no baetyl like the one found in the sanctuary at Ayia Irini has been found in the tombs of Amathus, probably because it served as the cult image in a local shrine and had to be re- turned just as anthropomorphic cult images had to be returned to their temples at the conclusion of puri- ficatory rituals and processions that took place out- side of the sanctuary. But for the funerary ritual to be represented accurately in terracotta, sphere-bearing figurines were included among the models of the other participants as representations of their human counterparts who carried the baetyl during the rite. These terracotta baetyls stayed in the tombs as sub- stitutes for the cult image, just as the terracotta an- thropomorphic and theriomorphic figurines remained as surrogates for their living counterparts. If this reconstruction is correct, then sphere- bearing anthropomorphic figurines were placed in the tombs of Amathus to represent one element of a funerary ritual that had been performed by their hu- man counterparts during the burial of the deceased. Since many of the same types of figurines that ap- pear in the sanctuary at Ayia Irini also appear in the tombs of Amathus, the rituals performed in both places may have had something in common. Unfor- tunately, the lack of literary evidence prohibits us from speculating about its significance. Neverthe- less, an accurate identification of the spheres held by these figurines may one day provide valuable in- sights into the funerary rituals of archaic Cyprus. NOTES 1None of the publications on Levantine and Cypriot terracottas cited above contain illustrations or descriptions of this type of figurine, nor are they found in Palma di Cesnola (1877), Ohnefalsch-Richter (1893), Murray, Smith, and Walters (1900), the volumes on the Swedish Cyprus Expedition, or the reports of the French excavations in the city of Amathus published annually in Bulletin de corre- spondance hellnique. 2For similar thrones with ovoid baetyls (possibly of Baal), see Seyrig 1963: 17-28, Cintas 1947: fig. 128.
