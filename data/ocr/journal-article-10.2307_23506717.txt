<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GOLDEN CALF* LLOYD R. BAILEY The Divinity School, Duke University, Durham, N. C. SCHOLARS today are generally agreed upon the interpretation of the golden calves erected by Jeroboam I,1 and possibly earlier by Aaron at Sinai.2 The consensus is that they were intended to be vari ations upon the cherubim, pedestals upon which the invisible Yahweh rode.3 Jeroboam's intention, it is believed, was to provide an orthodox cultic individuality for his newly founded national shrines at Dan and Bethel. But, with the passage of time, the obvious similarities to the * Offered in memory of Dr. Hildegard Lewy, זיל, scholar, teacher, friend. 1 I Kings 12:25-33. 22 Exodus 32. The multiple parallels between the two accounts are outlined by Moses Aberbach and Leivy Smolar, "Aaron, Jeroboam, and the Golden Calves," JBLJBL 86 (1967), pp. 129-140. On this basis, most scholars suggest that the Exodus account is secondary, serving as a negative precedent in an attempt to discredit Jeroboam. Among those following this line are: Martin Noth, Exodus (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1962), pp. 246 f.; John Gray, I and II Kings (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1963), p. 290; Leroy Waterman, "Bull-Worship in Israel," AJSLAJSL 31 (1915), pp. 229 ff.; Roland de Vaux, Ancient Israel (New York: McGraw Hill, 1961), pp. 334, 395; Robert Pfeiffer, Religion in the Old Testament (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1961), pp. 41, 75 (hereafter cited as Religion)■, "Images of Yahweh," JBL 40 (1926), p. 216. A major argument for this position is that the grammatical plural אלה אלהץ־ is correct for I Kings 12 (referring to Dan and Bethel), whereas it is not for the single calf of Exodus 32. In response, one might point out that a grammatical plural may be a pluralis majestatis (see below); that the plural is no more appropriate for Jeroboam than for Aaron, since, speaking at either sanctuary, only one calf would be present (following Martin Buber, Moses [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1958], p. 148, n. 177); that the Exodus account has in dividual details which suggest its autonomy, e. g., the golden rings used to make the idol, presumably brought from Egypt and thus integral to the whole exodus account (following Walter Beyerlin, Origins and History of the Oldest Sinaitic Tra ditionsditions [Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1965], p. 126); and that the expression, "who led you out of the land of Egypt" is immediately relevant to the Aaron affair, but to Jeroboam only if he is restoring an ancient practice, patterning himself after Aaron. If the Jeroboam account is primary, the remark is abrupt, to say the least. Among those who suggest the priority of the Aaron account are Aberbach and Smolar, Beyerlin, and W. F. Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity (2nd ed.; New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1957 [original publication, 1940]), pp. 300 ff. (cited hereafter as FSAC). 33 This interpretation was made popular by Albright (FSA C, pp. 299 ff.), follow ing H. Obbink, "Jahwebilder," ZAW 47 (1929). 264-279. A few of those who follow this approach are: Walter Eichrodt, Theology of the Old Testament (Phila delphia: The Westminster Press, 1961), I, 115 ff.; Otto Eissfeldt, "Lade und Stier bild," ZAW 58 (1940-41), 190 ff.; de Vaux, Ancient Israel, pp. 333 f.; Buber, Moses, pp. 148 f.; Noth, Exodus, p. 247; History of Israel (2nd English ed.; New York: 97</page><page sequence="2">98 LLOYD R. BAILEY [2] Ba'alBa'al cult created confusion,4 and/or the people began to identify the pedestal with Yahweh himself, thus creating idol worship.5 Y. Kaufmann suggests that opposition arose among the Jerusalem priest hood at a later period, when "orthodox zealotry (was) exaggerated beyond all bounds."6 The certitude of this interpretation is illustrated by these remarks: "The connection of the bull with Yahweh is unmistakable,"7 or, "No other interpretation can be squared with the known facts."8 In view of this near-unanimity of scholars and the confidence with which the conclusion is held, it seems anachronistic, if not presump tuous, to raise a dissent. And yet, there are many data that must be considered before the "pedestal of Yahweh" interpretation can be accepted without serious reservation. I list the following: 1. 1. The texts themselves contain no direct evidence, or even in sinuation, that the calf is a pedestal, or that a deity, either visible or invisible, is atop it. This does not deny the possibility of that inter pretation, however. 2. Even if the calf is a pedestal, we must ask ourselves carefully, "For whom?" Walter Harrelson suggests that it must be Yahweh, since deliverance from Egypt is attributed to him ("These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt" [Exod. 32:4]), and since Aaron proclaims a feast to Yahweh (Exod. 32:5).® On the contrary, can we automatically assume that all those leaving Egypt would attribute deliverance to Yahweh, especially since, accord ing to the E account (Exod. 3), Yahwism had just been introduced to the people there,10 they having previously worshipped "the God of your father(s)"?" Harper and Row, i960), p. 233; Gray, I and II Kings, p. 290; Yehezkel Kaufmann, The The Religion of Israel (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, i960), p. 271; W. J. Harrelson, "Calf, Golden," in IDB, I, 488-489. In view of this, how Norman Gott wald (A Light to the Nations [New York: Harper and Row, 1959], p. 213) can say that Albright's position "has been too summarily dismissed" escapes me. 4 Albright, FSAC. p. 301, suggests that "taurine associations of Baal" were brought in. Cf. Harrelson, IDB, I, 489a. 5 Harrelson. ibid. 6 The Religion of Israel, p. 271, and in general, the sources of note 3, above. 7 Harrelson, IDB, I, pp. 488 f. 8 Albright, FSAC, p. 300. י IDB, I, p. 489. 10 The deity thusly identifies himself and says that thus he is to be remembered "throughout all generations." This tradition is made even more explicit by P (Exod. 6:2 ff.), and its correctness is attested by a number of points: the absence of Yahwistic names prior to the time of Moses; by a Quranic tradition that Moses forsook his former religion (20:88 ff.; cf. 20:50 ff.); and by the fanatical monolatry of the post-Mosaic period, as compared with a wide tolerance previously. 11 Exod. 3:13, cf. 3:6. This epithet is parallel to 'ËI Sadday in Gen. 49:25, and</page><page sequence="3">[3] THE GOLDEN CALF 99 As for the fact that Aaron proclaims a Yahwistic feast, it seems quite possible that this is an addition by the P-source, one of several in the account, whose function it is to "rehabilitate" Aaron from his heinous apostasy.12 Kaufmann suggests that the deity must be Yahweh, since "the story does not link the calves with any foreign deity."13 It is true that it does not do so explicitly, although one finds Kaufmann's logic hardly compelling. We will address ourselves below to what seems to be a possible alternative identification. There is, then, little direct evidence that the assumed deity, atop the assumed pedestal, is Yahweh. But we cannot, as yet, deny this interpretation. 3. It is sometimes suggested that opposition to the calves did not arise until the time of the Deuteronomistic historians (with the excep tion of Hosea), and thus, that the cult of the North was, until that time, recognized as an orthodox expression of Yahwism. Why, it is argued, do we hear no protests from Elijah, Elisha, or Amos?14 This line of reasoning is questionable at several points, (a) It is based upon silence, (b) It admits the explicit opposition of Hosea, which is fatal to the entire position, (c) Criticism of the worship of the calf is as old as JE, since it presents the Sinaitic covenant as having been broken by Israel's following the lead of Aaron at this point. 4. If the cultic activities involving the calf were, after all, legiti mate, why did the Aaronites not defend themselves with that fact? On the contrary, they try desperately to excuse their ancestor for his activities on that occasion. 5. What is the translation and implication of the expression אלה אלהיך (Exod. 32:4)? It is possible that it is a pluralis majestatis,15 with which a plural verb and adjective (as here) is well attested.16 Indeed, I have tried to establish his identity in "Israelite 'ËI Sadday and Amorite Bel Sadê," JBLJBL 87 (1968), 434-438. " The earliest account seems to include 1-5a, 6 (reading the verbs in the sin gular, i. e., with Aaron as the subject rather than the people, with LXX), 15-20, 3°-33&gt; 34a, and 35 (emending the latter with Targum and Syriac: "because they worshipped the calf which Aaron made"). Verses 7-14 and 25-29 are clearly secondary and seem to reflect D. P's attempt to exonerate Aaron is visible in 21-24, 5b, the switch to the plural in the verbs of 4 and 6, and the contradictory verb "made" in 35. It might be remembered that Aaron plays a minor role in J, is men tioned but twice in D (where God wants to kill him for making the calf [Deut. 9:20], and when he dies [10:6]), but suddenly assumes total authoritative control of the priesthood in P, necessitating desperate attempts to excuse his behavior in Exod. 32. גי The Religion of Israel, p. 270.

BAILEY [4] the context demands a singular, since there is no reason for Aaron to have made more than one calf.17 And if we translate, "This is your God," does it not denote antipathy to the one introduced by Moses, whom the people have now quickly forgotten? The people likely re verted to their old religion (that of "the god of the fathers") and to their traditional priest, Aaron. Aaron knows precisely what to do: he creates an image of אלהים and announces that He, not Yahweh, is the deliverer. That there was a controversy over this matter much later is suggested by Deut. 33:12, where we read, concerning Israel's escape from Egypt: "Yahweh alone did lead him, and there was no strange God with him."18 6. The designation אלהים may have identified the calf with, or as the representative of, a deity, and if so, the pedestal interpretation is weakened. Hence the prophet Ahijah of Shiloh can say to Jeroboam, in behalf of Yahweh, "You have done evil . . . making for yourself other gods19. . . and have cast me behind your back" (I Kings 14:9). 7. What is the implication of such onomastic forms as עגלון (a per son: Judg. 3:12; a town: Josh. 10:3), meaning, "Belonging to the (divine?) Calf";20 עגלה (a person: II Sam. 3:5), meaning "Heifer," and possibly referring to the consort of a deity represented by a calf;21 and 22,בית עגלים "the Temple of the (two) Calves"? 8. It has been pointed out that the ancient Near East does not know theriomorphic gods, "but only the association of beasts with deities pictured in human form whose companions and bearers they are."23 In actual fact, however, animals were sometimes considered to perhaps Isa. 45:9, reading ,fcnh. Cf. Buber, Moses, p. 148. For singular meaning, used with plural adjective: Deut. 4:7; Josh. 24:19. " This assumes the independence of this account from that of I Kings 12, as defended in note 2 (above). 18 That the E tradition attributes deliverance to אלהיט may not have been a mere difference in terminology at the earliest stage of that tradition. An early attempt to propose the identity of the two can be found in Gen. 2-3, where the base-stratum אלהיט has been regularly glossed by יהוה. I examined this in " 'Elôhîm and Yahweh: Are They Identical?" read at the 106th Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature, 1968. The article will be submitted for publication in the near future. " Following the suggestion of notes 15 and 16, one could as well translate, "another god." 20 Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar, #86 f; Julius Lewy, "The Old West Semitic Sun God IJammu," HUCA 18 (1944), 452 ff. 21 Lewy, ibid., p. 443, n. 84. 22 On the identification of the site with Tell el-'Ajjul, see Nelson Glueck, Rivers Rivers in the Desert (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Cudahy, 1959), p. 41.

They embody the attributes of the deity (his beauty, strength, bravery, speed, etc.), and as such, their image could be directly worshipped in connection with his cult. On cylinder seals, for example, one sometimes finds a sacred animal in the background while an anthropomorphic deity is being worshipped.24 That the animal himself might receive the divine honors is shown by représenta tions of him standing alone near an offering table,25 or stronger yet, directly worshipped.26 A priest or minor deity approaches him with hand upraised in the typical gesture of adoration. Interestingly, the animal is often a bull. Therefore, can one validly object to the calf of Exod. 32-I Kings 12 being described as a "god" or to deliverance from Egypt being attributed to it? 9. Hosea describes the priests of the cult of the calf as כמרים (io:5), a term never used for a Yahwistic priesthood. This alone, it seems to me, is sufficient to sever the calf from any connection with Yahwism. 10. It is even more difficult to believe that the calf was ever iden tiffed with Baal,27 or was in danger of being syncretized with him.28 When Jehu overthrew the dynasty of Omri, it is specifically men tioned that the nation was cleansed from Baalism (II Kings 10). And yet we read, "He did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam . . . the golden calves in Dan and Bethel" (vs. 29). In conclusion, it is most difficult to accept the nearly unanimous enthusiasm of contemporary scholarship for the "Yahweh pedestal" interpretation. One is more tempted to agree with T. J. Meek, who remarked a number of years ago that there is for this interpretation 24 George Contenau, La Glyphiques syro-hittite (Paris: Paul Geuthner, 1922), Plates V:15; VII:24; VI:22; Lubor Matous (éd.), Inscriptions cunéiformes du Kultépé,Kultépé, II (Prague: Éditions de l'Academie Tchécoslovaque des Sciences, 1962), seals 82a. 589c, 594, 605b, 643a, 708; Julius Lewy (éd.), TCL 21, Tablettes cappa dociennes,dociennes, 3rd series, 3rd part (Paris: Paul Geuthner, 1937), seals 9, 10, 14. 2s Contenau, ibid., Plate 11:5, 6. 26 Ibid., Plate X:44; Matous, ICK II, seals 280b, 281b, 387d, 404, 495d, 524a, 646. 83b; Lewy, TCL 21, seals 73-78, 7-8; O.

BAILEY [6] "not one whit of evidence, but everything to the contrary."29 But what alternatives have we? It is sometimes suggested that the solution may be found in the Egyptian religious sphere, since Israel spent considerable time in Egypt before the Exodus and since Jeroboam was forced by Solomon to flee to the court of Shishak (I Kings 11:40). The calf would thus likely be a representation of the bull-god Apis.30 It is true that, in the ancient Near East, the alien often acknowledges the overlordship of the local deities, in addition to his own, in order to secure their pro tection and enjoy their particular benefits.31 And furthermore, the biblical writers were aware of non-Yahwistic worship in the land of ־' AJSL 45 (1924)&gt; Ρ· 5°ז· Two other, and related reasons for doubting this interpretation are given below, at notes 114, 115. 30 Pfeiffer, Religion, p. 75; "Images of Yahweh," JBL 45 (1926), 217 f. Eva Danelius, "The Sins of Jeroboam Ben-Nabat," JQR 58 (1967), 95-114, 204-223, tries to relate it rather to the cult of Hathor, basing herself upon the fact that LXX and Josephus describe Jeroboam's calves as δαμάλίΐ; ("heifers; young cows"), whereas LXX describes Aaron's as μόσχο; ("bull"). Therefore, she argues, the two incidents have no connection. She believes that MT's עגל (I Kings) is an abbreviated plural (for עגלות, which LXX realized). It seems much more likely to me that LXX simply erred, and that the translator of the Exodus passage was not the same as the one for Kings (i. e., the δαμάλί1;-μόσχο; distinction is not deliberate). She concludes her argument with Josephus, who, she correctly says, has been vindicated in his reports of buildings and monuments at Caesarea and Massada. "Therefore, if Josephus consistently speaks of Jeroboam's 'heifers,' there is no other way but to accept his statements as literally true" (p. 109). How trustworthiness in con temporary observation can be equated with trustworthiness in relation to events a millennium before is not asked, nor is the possibility that Josephus simply ac cepted LXX rather than interpreted MT raised. Then she turns to Hosea 10:5 (לעגלות בית און) emending it to . . . לעגל, suggesting that LXX τω μόσχω is in error (supported by Aquila's δαμάλε«). Here again, the argument escapes me. If in deed, Jeroboam erected images of "heifers," the gender of MT (Hosea 10:5) should be maintained. Nor is Aquila "correcting" LXX, but, in usual fashion, is slavishly reproducing MT. For a more reasonable understanding of Hosea at this point, see note 114 (below). Danelius further supports an identification of Jeroboam's image with Hathor by comparing the name of his father, Nabat, with Egyptian NBT, "lady," an epithet of that goddess. But can the feminine ending "t" of the epithet be equated with the "t" of Nabat? I will try to explain the name otherwise at note 78 (below). 31 For Old Assyrian examples from Asia Minor, see Julius Lewy, "Les textes paleo-assyriens et l'Ancien Testament," RHR, no (1934), 50 ff.; and among the biblical examples, Abraham pays homage to the deity of Jerusalem while passing through his territory (Gen. 14; on the pre-Yahwistic cult at Jerusalem, see Hilde gard Lewy, "Origin and Significance of the Mdgin Ddwid," ArOr 183 (1950), 330 365); David takes certain necessary steps to secure the permission of the patron deity of Jerusalem before attempting its conquest (H. Lewy, ibid., pp. 332-334); and the Israelite patriarchs and their successors pay respects at the various local Canaanite shrines (e.g., Gen. 21:33, אל עולם; Judg. 8:33; 9:4, 46, בעל ברית).</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE GOLDEN CALF 103 Egypt.32 Nevertheless, this proposal encounters serious difficulties: the absence of theophoric names; the absence of sanctity attributed to living bulls; the fact that the Israelites would scarcely expect an Egyptian god to deliver them from the Pharaoh, himself a deity; and the deliverance itself, which proved the impotence of Egyptian deities. In seeking for a solution, it is useful to remember that "Israel" was a rather late, composite entity, whose components arrived in Canaan over the span of nearly a millennium, each bringing its own traditions, religion, and genealogy. Among them were Yahwistic clans33 who traced the worship of their deity back to their remote ancestors (Gen. 4:26, J). Others learned of that deity only at the time of Moses (Exod. 3, E; 6, P), subsequently identifying him with their own ancestral deity.34 Is it not logical to suppose, therefore, that the identity of the calf may be found in the cult of one of Israel's con stituent elements, during its pre-Yahwistic period? In particular, we should seek it among the Northern (Rachel) clans, in keeping with the witness of the E tradition, and with the fact that it is Joseph who seems most solidly grounded in the event of the Egyptian sojourn following which the "revelation" of the divine name "Yahweh" took place.35 In one case, at least, we have explicit reference to the pre-Ca naanite origins of one of Israel's components: from those who traced their origins back to a patriarch or Patriarchs from Mesopotamia, specifically Ur and Harran. Nor is there good reason to doubt the tradition, since the movement seems to correspond with that of the so-called Amorite migration and since the Mari and Nuzi documents illuminate the patriarchal background. And this brings us to the crucial questions: Can we ascertain what the religion of these ances tors might have been? Did they indeed forsake it for Yahwism 3־ Ezek. 23:3; Josh. 24:14; Acts 7:39 f.; cf. Ezek. 8:7-12. 33 The name "Judah" may itself be Yahwistic, if it is composed of the divine name יהו plus the Hurrian particle of appurtenance, -da, such that the name would mean "the One belonging to Yahweh" (on which see Julius Lewy, "Influences Hurrites sur Israël," RÉS 1938 [no. 2], p. 54, who likewise demonstrates the possi bility of such an etymology, from a historical, cultural, and linguistic point of view). Furthermore, it is Judean onomastics which overwhelmingly reflects Yahweh wor ship, as contrasted with the North (on which see W. F. Albright, Archaeology and the the Religion of Israel [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1956], pp. 113, 156 f., 160 ff.; cf. Meek, Hebrew Origins, pp. 112 ff.). 34 A process clearly at work in Exod. 3, where Yahweh is equated with "the god of your father(s)." 3s See esp. Martin Noth, Ûberlieferungsgeschichte des Pentateuch (Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer Verlag, 1948), pp. 226 ff.; History, pp. 117 f. ; J. Vergote, Joseph en Égypte (Louvain: Publications Universitaires, 1959).</page><page sequence="8">104 LLOYD R. BAILEY [8] (Gen. 12),36 as the J tradition would lead us to believe, or are they among those who only learned of this faith at Sinai? If the latter, have we an antecedent for the golden calf in their religious background? If the ancestors of a faction of what was to become Israel lived for generations in the vicinity of Ur and Harran, they can scarcely have escaped knowledge of the lunar deity, Sin. Indeed, some of their names suggest that they worshipped him as well.37 For example, we find Têrah, the father of Abraham38 (Gen. 11:26), and Laban, the 3636 One of the most recent defenses of this tradition is that of E. A. Speiser, Genesis Genesis (Anchor Bible I; New York: Doubleday, 1964), pp. xlv ff., who suggests that Abraham, dissatisfied with the culture and polytheism of Mesopotamia, made a clean break with both and set out for the land of Canaan. Why he would expect the latter place to be less conducive to, or less grounded in, polytheism is not clear to me. " The connection between onomastics and the religion(s) of the clan is scarcely to be doubted. (See J. J. Stamm, Namengebung, [ — MV(A)G 44 (1939)], parag. 3-5.) E. g., there usually is an excellent correlation between the theophoric names in a particular city and its chief deity. Let us consider the case of Uras, a god wor shipped at Dilbat, since he is rather obscure otherwise and thus a good test case. Uras names predominate in Dilbat, whereas otherwise they are practically non-existant. (Compare Arthur Ungnad, Untersuchungen zu den Urkunden aus Dilbat [Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs' Buchhandlung, 1909], pp. 116 ff., with other publications of ancient Near Eastern onomastics.) Relevant also is the fact that certain names reflect the historical situation of birth, showing that they were not randomly chosen (e. g., Sabatai, "the One born during the sapattu period"; חני, "the One born during the Festival"; the throne-names assumed by monarchs; etc.). But, it may be argued, how do we know that such considerations have not ceased to be operative by the biblical period, and hence that a name in the OT has no religious significance? Fortunately we have evidence to the contrary as late as the Mosaic age. Prior to that period, no Yahwistic names are attested in the OT. Thereafter they appear sporadically until the time of the monarchy, when they begin to flourish (pre sumably because this religion now enjoyed the sanction of the ruler). Inscriptions and seals from Judah never mention Baal, whereas in the North Baal names out number Yahwistic ones in a ratio of 7:11 (Albright, Archaeology and the Religion of of Israel, pp. 160 f., 113). This well agrees with the loyalty of the South and the apostasy of the North as reflected in the biblical texts. Furthermore, the wide spread biblical practice of explaining the meaning of names, which continued until the Exile (see Andrew F. Key, "The Giving of Proper Names in the Old Testa ment," JBL 83 (1964), p. 56) is supportive, even if the etymology given is often incorrect. Even more important for my case is the change of name when a new status is assumed (see Otto Eissfeldt, "Renaming in the Old Testament," in Words and and Meanings [Peter R. Ackroyd, ed.; Cambridge: University Press, 1968], pp. 6979־)• Note in particular that when David gives his son a name containing that of the god of the Jebusites (so Hildegard Lewy, ArOr 183 [1950], p. 334), Nathan, immediately grasping the implications, assigns him a Yahwistic name (II Sam. 12:24-25). 3» The name apparently means, "the (lunar) deity Têr is the (divine) Brother." On the worship of this deity by Semites in the vicinity of Uarran, see J. Lewy,</page><page sequence="9">[9] THE GOLDEN CALF 105 father of Racheb9 (Gen. 29:5 ff.). Ambiguous but supporting evi dence40 is supplied by such names as Sarah, the wife of Abraham;41 Milcah, the daughter of Harran42 (Gen. 11:2أرو and Leah and Rachel, the daughters of Laban.U Interestingly, writers from a much later period, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim, record traditions that Israel's patriarchal ancestors were devotees of the astral cults. For example, they say that Jacob and his sons carried out various activities in this regard;44 that Abraham's HUCA 19 (1945), pp. 425 ff.

That the root was used to denote the lunar deity is shown by such names as Labanaila, "the Moon (or: Laban) is the deity," which is all the more relevant since the name is West Semitic. (See J. Lewy, HUCA 18 (1944), p. 434, n. 39; 455 ff.) As late as the nth century, A. D., the Arab scholar al-Biruni records that a name for the moon (المم) is لفانة (apparently the Hebrew לבנה): al-Athar al-Baqiyah יan al-Qurun al-Khaliyah, ed. c. Eduard Sachau, Chron ologie orientalischer Volker von alberuni (Leipzig: F. A. Brockhaus, 1878) p. 192. 40 As is well kown, a given epithet may be used by the writers of antiquity to describe more than one deity. The examples in nn. 41-43 assume relevance, there fore, only in relation to those in nn. 38-39. יי The most common explanation of the name is the Akkadian sarratu, queen, an often used appellation for NIN.GAL, the spouse of Sin (Knut Tallquist, "Akka dische Gotterepitheta," StOr 7 [1938], 238). Other explanations have been that it is related to the roots שרה, "to shine" 0ثرىآ "to be fertile." 12 Evidently the Akkadian malkatu, "princess." Istar, the daughter of Sin, is often called malikat ilani, "the Princess of the gods" (Tallquist, ibid.., p. 129). גי The former seems to mean "cow," an animal whose lunar associations are well known. Its use as an epithet is illustrated by Ab-di-H-a'-ti (Sennacherib Prism, I, line 49), "Servant of the (divine?) Cow." The latter name apparently means "ewe," an animal especially under the protection of Istar (E. Douglas Van Buren, "Religious Rites and Rituals at the Time of Uruk IVIII," AfO 13 [193941L 37, 4أ).

The former remark probably is related to the fact that Joseph married the daughter of a priest of On (Gen. 41:45), which is also called בית שמש (Jerem. 43:13; LXX "Heliopolis"). As for the term "Ermiuth," it may refer to the Greek god Hermes, the planet Mercury, whom the Mesopotamians called "Nusku," and regarded as the son of the moon-god Sin. He was also iden tified with the Egyptian moon-god Thoth (see "Hermes Trismegistus" in The Oxford Classical Dictionary, p. 418).</page><page sequence="10">106 LLOYD R. BAILEY [10] family was devoted to the lunar deity of Harran;45 and that Têra[} worshipped a lunar crescent.46 These three things, then, physical proximity to famous cultic centers, theophoric names, and subsequent explicit tradition, provide uniform and substantial reason for believing that lunar worship pre vailed among one part of Israel's ancestry in Mesopotamia. But the crucial question yet remains: Did they forsake that faith when they migrated to the land of Canaan? Let us now turn to a variety of evidence which suggests that they did not. 1. 1. We have the explicit evidence of the E and P traditions (Exod. 3, 6) that part of Israel did not accept Yahwism until the Mosaic period. But can it be demonstrated that Joseph, who seems most solidly grounded in the Egyptian bondage tradition,47 is descended from the patriarchs of Harran? He is designated as the favorite son of his father (Gen. 32:2; 37:1 ff.); in the "Blessing of Jacob," the patriarchal deity (specifically אל אביך ,אביר יעקב, and 48[אל] שדי) is men tioned only in relation to him; he gives Joseph a special blessing (Gen. 48); the tribe seems attested in Canaan as early as the 18th century, B. C.,49 around the time of the so-called Amorite migration; 45 The Arab historian al-Kindi (9th century, A. D.) relates: "We know, from the book of Genesis, that Abraham lived with his people fourscore years and ten, in the land of Harran, worshipping none other than A1 Ozza, an idol famous in that land, and adored by the men of Harran under the name of the moon, which same custom prevails among them to the present day" (The Apology of al Kinday. ed. Sir W. Muir, sec. 17). Whether the historian was correct in designating the moon god by the well known epithet al-'Uzza is debatable, but that need not concern us here. 46 The Cabalistic work ספר התפוח says of Têrab : כשעבד בקרן והוא צלם הירח, and then adds: עזאי יואן הצלם הנקרא. "When he worshipped (by means of) the horn(s), it was an image of the moon. The image was called עזאי יואן." The first part of the name reminds us of the afore-mentioned al-'Uzza (above, note 45), and the second part of the Old Latin "Jana" ("moon"). See Monumenta Talmudica, Erster Band: BibelBibel ■und Babel, ed. Solomon Funk (Wien und Leipzig: Orion-Verlag, 1913), pp. 319 f. This is a most amazing description, coming, as it does, from a Medieval source, and perhaps reflects a continuous tradition in Judaism. 4' See above, note 35. That Benjamin (depicted in the biblical genealogies as Joseph's only full brother) is integrally related to Joseph has often been defended: Eissfeldt, CAH (rev. éd.), II, xxxiv, p. 11 ; Michael Astour, "Benê-Iamina et Jéricho," SemiticaSemitica 9 (1959), 5-20; cr. Noth, Ûberlieferungsgeschichte, pp. 226 ff. That Levites shared in the experience is the belief of Meek, Hebrew Origins, pp. 32 f., which is supported by the fact that they alone have Egyptian names. The close ancestral relationship of Levi and Judah is shown by their common mother, and since I have suggested that Yahwism was indigenous to the tribe of Judah (above, note 33), this may have been the means whereby that faith was introduced to the Rachel clans. 48 Gen. 49:24, reading with MSS and versions against the unlikely את of MT. 49 Albright, J AOS 74 (1954), 225, n. 16.</page><page sequence="11">[11] THE GOLDEN CALF 107 the patriarchal deity is often described as a "bull,"50 as is the deity of the tribe of Joseph;51 Benjamin, his only full brother,52 may well be related to the nomadic DUMU.MES-ya-mi-na [Banû-yamïna, "Benjaminites"], who roamed in the vicinity of Harran in the patriar chal period.53 The possibility is a real one, then, that the Rachel tribes retained the ancestral faith, the one brought from Harran, until the Mosaic age. 2. The family ties with Harran were not severed by the migration to Canaan, if we may accept the tradition at this point. A journey is made there to select a wife for Isaac (Gen. 24), and Jacob, forced to flee there, spends 14 years and marries (Gen. 27). Such an extended stay cannot help but have supported the traditional faith of the family, as opposed to any innovations accepted in the land of Canaan. At the conclusion of his residence, Jacob makes a covenant with his father-in-law, Laban (Gen. 31:43ff.). This was done by erecting a cairn atop a mountain,54 taking oaths in the name of the deity, and celebrating a sacred meal during the night. The time of the ceremony suggests that it was to take place in the presence of astral deities,55 which is precisely what we would expect. Then follows the oath formula: אלהי אברהם ואלהי נחור ישפטו בינינו אלהי אביהם (vs. 53)• Literally: "The god of Abraham and the god of Nalior judge between us, the god of their ancestors." Are the gods distinct, or identical? Eissfeldt, on the basis of the plural verb, argues that they are distinct.56 Alt agrees, suggesting that the last two words are an editorial addition to create the impression that only one God (Yahweh) is denoted, and that the LXX uses the singular verb to create the same impression.57 5° Numb. 23:22; 24:8; Gen. 49:24; Isa. 1:24; 49:26; 60:16; Psalm 132:2, 5. Not once is the term used in connection with the cult of Judah (see Meek, Hebrew Origins,Origins, p. 140). The use of this term with regard to the patriarchal deity is not unrelated to our problem of identifying the cult of the calves in Exod. 32, I Kings 12. 51 Deut. 33:13 ff.; cf. Gen. 49:22, where we have the problematic בן פרת. Even better is the possibility that פרת = "Euphrates," denoting his place of origin. (Cf. J. A. Emerton, "Some Difficult Words in Genesis 49," Words and Meanings, pp. 91 ff.). 5־ See above, note 47. ss This identification, once strongly supported but now increasingly abandoned, I have sought to establish in JBL 87 (1968), 437 f. One of their clans, incidentally, was named Iarifru, whose identity with the name of the lunar deity (yarah) seems established. The idea of a tribe taking its name from its patron deity is well at tested, e. g., ירח (Gen. 10:26); Assur; etc. s&lt;54 That the lunar deity was regarded as dwelling in such constructions has been pointed out by Julius Lewy, HUCA 19 (1945), pp. 446 f. ss Jubilees 29:6 places the event at the full moon. 56 "El and Yahweh," JSS 1 (1956), p. 32, n. 1. 5' Albrecht Alt, "The God of the Fathers," (in Essays on Old Testament History and Religion•, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1966, pp. 3-77), pp. 17 f., 28 f.</page><page sequence="12">108 LLOYD R. BAILEY [12] On the contrary, if the plural verb establishes two deities, would an editor surmise that this could be disguised? If the alleged addition does not mislead the modern reader, it likely would not the ancient one. And why would such an editor,' as well as the LXX, feel it ne cessary to create such an identity, especially since the biblical text elsewhere explicitly denies the Yahwistic faith to Nahor (Josh. 24:2)? Is it not possible, therefore, that the LXX rendering of the verb is the correct one, and therefore the deities are identical (and not Yahweh), just as the last two words suggest? In any case, the profane nature of the ceremony, from a Yahwistic point of view, is attested by the prophet Hosea (12:12).58 3. During his flight toward Harran, Jacob stopped to spend the night at Bethel (Gen. 28).59 After sunset,60 the deity appears to him in a dream, following which we read: "And he dreamed that there was a סלם erected on the earth, and its head reached the sky." Finally, the deity appears atop the structure and converses with Jacob. What is the □סל, whose top reaches the sky [וראשו מגיע השמיטה (vs. 12)], and which is connected with "the gate of heaven" [שער השמים (vs. 17)]? It may be related to Akkadian simmiltu, Phoenician smlt,smlt, and Syriac sblta', whose basic meaning is "block, slab of stone."61 We would have, then, some type of massive, stepped structure of great height, used for religious purposes. It seems quite similar to the structure in Gen. 11, which is likewise described as having "its head in the heavens" [וראשו בשמים (vs. 4)]. Now, the ziqqurrats, Mesopo tamian temple towers for the worship of astral deities, are described in just this idiom: gigunnâsu sïram rêsïsa kïma samê ulli,62 "Its sub lime gigunnû, its head, I finished as high as the heavens"; Etemenaki ziqqurratziqqurrat Bâbili . . . rêsïsa samàmi,63 "Etemenaki, the ziqqurrat of Babylon ... its head high as the heavens." Appropriately, the deity is depicted as standing atop the structure, since it was to the shrine atop the ziqqurrat (the gigunnû) that the deity came down to reveal himself in dreams. In fact, sanctuaries in 58 Reading גלעד for ־ty^il, referring to the cairn erected by Jacob as part of the covenant ceremony. 59 Whether he did so in the local shrine, seeking an incubation dream, need not concern us here, although it seems logical in the context. 60 Again, suggesting astral worship (since the stars will be visibly present), as does the medium of the theophany, by dream. See W. Robertson Smith, Lectures on on the Religion of the Semites (3rd edition, 1927; reprinted by KTAV, 1969), pp. 166, 362. 61 Albright, Archaeology and the Religion of Israel, p. 221, n. 121.

In the case of astral deities, such an entrance was often described as a "gate."64 In conclusion, we may suggest that the dream at Bethel (save for its Yahwistic overlay) is a genuine tradition from the patriarchal age. As such, Jacob, in his dream, conceived of the deity in much the same way as his ancestors at Harran, which strengthens the possi bility that "the god of Na[)0r" is none other than "the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." 4. Onomastics provides further evidence of the continuation of the lunar faith after the departure from Harran. To be sure, some of the Mesopotamian designations of the moon-god scarcely continue (e. g., Sin, Ter, Laban), but others do, and in particular the epithet "Brother." That this designation can refer to a deity has been known for some time, and is illustrated by the following examples, which exempt the human sibling relationship: Alji-ili-ia,65 "the Brother is my god"; Ahi-lamas§i,66 "the Brother is my protecting deity"; Ahua bani,67 "the Brother is my creator"; A-}j.u-l-lum,w "the Brother is divine"; and many others. That it may designate the lunar deity in particular is shown by the previously discussed patriarchal ancestor, Terah, "Ter (i. e., the moon-god) is the Brother," and the explicit identification of Sin and Nergal as mulma§-tab-ba-gal-gal-la,69 "the big twins."70 When we turn to biblical onomastics, we find the same designa tion widely used in senses that cannot denote family relationships: אחאב (Ahab), "the Brother is my (divine) father," which seems iden tical to Akkadian A-ha-ab-bu and Ah-abi;71 אחימלך (I Sam. 21:2), "the Brother reigns," used for non-royalty;72 חיאל (I Kings 16:34), usually taken to mean something like " ΈΙ/god lives," as if the full form were יחיאל. In the latter case, the LXX would read ΊεΐήΧ (e. g., 64 See G. A. Wainwright, "Jacob's Bethel," PEFQS, 1934, pp. 32-44. This ziqqurrat interpretation is, of course, an old one, though sometimes denied. Among its recent defenders is E. A.

However, since the verb קום is often used to describe a god's supporting and "standing with" an individual (Zakir Inscription, lines 3, 14; Panamuwa, line 2), I am justified in the above translation. "E.g., אחינדב (I Kings 4:14); אחיסמך (Exod. 31:6); אחיעזר (Numb. 1:12); and אחירע (Numb. 1:15), where we should probably point אחיו־ע (with LXX Άχιρέ), "the Brother is a friend" (so G. R.

BAILEY [16] seems inadvisable to you to serve Yahweh, choose today whom you will serve, whether the gods90 whom your ancestors served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But my clan and I will serve Yahweh!" This is a most amazing passage. It confesses that the god of Nahor and Têrah, far from being abandoned by the patriarchal clan when they departed Harran, still survived until at least the time of Joshua with such strength that it presented a serious threat to Yahwism. It must have been considerably embarrassing to the Yahwists to pre serve such memories, which might suggest that the struggle continued even later until the time of the editor who placed it in the present setting so as to present a precedent for his contemporaries. Even if the tradition be without historical basis, its value as a witness to the continuation of the patriarchal faith is undiminished. Having thus far pointed to multiple evidence that the cult of the patriarchal clan from Harran was that of the moon-god, and that it continued long after their migration to Canaan, just as the E tradi tion informs us, we have before us one other major task: What is the possible relation of that cult to the golden calves erected by Aaron and Jeroboam I?92 The evidence is extensive, and ranges over three millennia. Perhaps it is well to begin at Ur, that great cult-center of the moon-god Nannar, where the deity is described in a hymn as: "Fercious bull, whose horn is thick, whose legs are perfected, who is bearded in lapis, and filled with luxury and abundance."93 This describes perfectly several golden calves (used as the bodies of harps)94 found in the "royal" cemetery at Ur.95 The tomb in which the harps were found seems to be that of the lunar priestess who served as the wife of the deity in the hieros gamos. ־י The suggestion of such a relationship is, of course, not new. It was proposed by Julius Lewy, HTJCA 19 (1945), 448; 18 (1944), 443, who offered abundant Mesopotamian parallels to the golden calf from the cult of Sin. For a posthumous résumé of Lewy's thought, see Andrew F. Key, "Traces of the Worship of the Moon God Sin among the Early Israelites," JBL 84 (1965). 20-26. Such parallels within themselves certainly do not establish contact, dependence, or identification. The approach taken in my paper is quite different, since I have only now come to Lewy's beginning point. I have sought first to establish the existence of the lunar religion in (part of) Israel's ancestry, to demonstrate its continuation using biblical evidence alone, and only then suggest the appropriateness of extra-biblical parallels. ניני ANET, "Hymn to the Moon God," translated by Ferris J.

Sayce,"6 was related to the name of the lunar deity Sin."7 The primary objection has been advanced by Albright, who remarks that "there is no in dication that the name Sin was ever employed by the Canaanites or the Semitic nomads of Palestine."8 The following remarks may be made in response to the objection. (1) The continuity of patriarchal 111 Numb. 28:11. 112 112 Numb. 28:14. Cf. Pirlfê de Rabbi Eliezer, 51. It is interesting that Bab. Talmud Rosh Hashanah 22b describes the new moon as a "heifer," although this cannot be viewed as evidence that this animal was ever regarded as sacred to the lunar deity. 113 Lunar worship, along with astral worship in general, is mentioned in a vast number of passages, e. g., Deut. 4:19; 17:3; II Kings 21:3 ff.; Jerem. 8:1 ff.; 19:13; 44:16 ff.; Job 31:26 f.; Ps. 81:3; Isa. 47:13; Zeph. 1:5; Numb. 10:10. 114 For a full defense of MT at this point, see Julius Lewy, HUCA 18 (1944), pp. 436-443. He properly suggests that the form is feminine, since a cult-city was regarded as "married" to its deity (again proving that the ענל was regarded as representing a deity, and not a pedestal!), and that it is a pluralis majestatis. 115 Reading כי מי ישראל והוא (cf. Judg. 9:28; 11:12 for a similar idiom). 116 Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion (2nd ed.; London: Williams and Norgate, 1888), pp. 42, 164. 11'As pointed out by J. Lewy (HUCA 19 [1945], 431, n. 138; 441, n. 172; 445, n. 180), it is composed of the divine name plus the termination -ay (a modification of -ày), creating an adjectivum relativum, "the mountain belonging to Sin." One might note the connection of the moon with various other mountains, e. g., Jebel Hilàl ("the mountain of the new moon") in the Sinai peninsula; Jebel Qamr ("the mountain of the moon") in Arabia; and Hala' el-Bedr ("the massif of the full moon") in the Hejaz. 118 FSA C, p. 263.</page><page sequence="19">[19] THE GOLDEN CALF 115 worship, from Harran to Canaan as outlined above, should make one hesitant to conclude the absence of Sin worship on the basis of lack of formal attestation. (2) The lunar goddess, consort of Sin, was known in Canaan under her Mesopotamian (Sumerian) designation, NIN.GAL ("the great Lady").119 Indeed, she was worshipped, under that title in 7th century, B. c. Syria,120 as was Sin himself.121 (3) An ally of Abraham is named שנאב (Gen. 14:2). Albright himself once considered this a Sin-name,122 but subsequently preferred deriving it from Sumu-ab(um).123 M. Astour objects to the Sin-etymology for the name, since it is spelled with ש instead of D.124 However, the spell ing is authenticated by the biblical name שנאצר (the Akkadian Sin uçur), given to the son of King Jeconiah (I Chr. 3:18). (4) An Egyp tian list of Semitic slaves, presumably from Palestine, contains the name Tn '(?)t's', which Albright considers to contain the divine element Sin.125 (5) A stele from Zenjirli (Bar Rekub) bears the in scription מראי בעל חרן, "My Lord is master of Harran," a term regu larly used to denote Sin.126 This is supported by the fact that the relief also bears the emblem of the lunar deity (a gibbous moon in crescent).127 The two small tassels (?)128 accompanying the emblem are similar to those on a stele with a lunar emblem from Harran.129 What is more important, the same tassels (?) occur on a stele from Hazor, dated to the 13th century, B. c.I3° It is part of the temple of a lunar deity, containing several massevot and the statue of a seated male deity with an inverted crescent emblem upon his neck. Such iconographie continuity may suggest that the temple was dedicated to none other than "the master of Harran," Sin. 119 The Nikkal Epic from Ugarit. !2° Nerab I, line 9. 121 Nerab I, line 1. 122 "A Revision of Early Hebrew Chronology," JPOS I (1920), 69. 123 "Abraham and the Caravan Trade," BASOR 163 (1961), 52. 124 "Political and Cosmic Symbolism in Genesis 14 and its Babylonian Sources," in Biblical Motifs (Alexander Altmann, ed.; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1966), p. 75. 12s J AOS 74 (1954). 232. 126 On this phrase, see H.
