<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 4 Confronting corpses and theatre animals tacChnoeridnmpafstraroeelnsting Peta Tait This chapter compares the presentation of dead animals in Gunther von Hagens’ unique ‘Animal inside out’ exhibition with the staging of animal bodies in recent theatre productions. Von Hagens’ exhibi- tions present actual body parts and Jane Desmond (2008, 348) aligns these with a ‘theatre of the dead’ created with taxidermy specimens. The theatre form, however, commonly presents replicas of animal bod- ies. Given ethical controversy over von Hagens’ anatomy exhibitions of specially treated plastinated bodies, the use of fake animals in theatre would seem to be more indicative of 21st-century pro-animal sympath- ies. This discussion considers the purposeful presentation of dead an- imals, using cognitive interpretations and ideas of the phenomenology of the body in viewing them. In a response to Desmond’s conceptual framing, the discussion contrasts the ‘Animal inside out’ exhibition in London with two original Australian realist plays because a focus on dead animals sets a theatrical precedent within Australia’s inherited realist theatre tradition, and possibly also in English-speaking theatre since it differs from the deployment of living animals in contemporary performance or live or dead animals in visual arts installations.1 While not condoning von Hagens’ exhibition, this chapter explains that it had P Tait (2013).

Sydney: Sydney University Press. 67 </page> <page sequence="2"> Animal death a stronger bodily impact than that achieved through theatre because looking at a dead body is not the same as viewing a lifelike replica. It argues that confronting, unpleasant encounters focus attention on animals. The underlying contention here is that looking at animals evokes body-based responses in viewers, and these are, in the extreme, palpable, viscerally felt sensations. Accordingly, graphic depictions of animal death have a physiological as well as cognitive impact. But theatre in particular additionally situates animals in narratives that evoke emotions – emotions are connected to the arousal of bodily feel- ings. Thus the larger point is that awareness of sensory engagement and unpleasant bodily reactions should be regarded as diverging from human-centred emotional narratives, and this distinction has implica- tions for the targeted effort to turn around social attitudes to animals in human worlds. Dead animals I visited von Hagens’ exhibition ‘Animal inside out’ at London’s Mu- seum of Natural History after having previously viewed ‘Body worlds’, which presented plastinated human corpses.2 I probably expected a comparable experience: motivated by curiosity, I walked through a very crowded ‘Body worlds’ space, making an effort to see the exhibits and pondering concerns about how the human bodies were obtained while observing a diverse public in attendance. On reflection, the human exhibits seemed almost benign because the experience of viewing ‘An- imal inside out’ unfolded in quite unexpected ways. The first major difference was the visual effect of the exhibits. On entering the exhib- ition, I stopped in surprise in front of a brilliantly coloured shark; a 1 See Phelan (1993) and Carlson (2003) for distinctions between the three art forms of theatre, performance and visual art. A pro-animal focus on dead animals is uncommon and, as far as can be established, arguably contributing to the English-speaking theatre precedent. The focus on living animals in theatre is apparent: for example, the Melbourne Theatre Company staged Edward Albee’s The goat, or who is Sylvia? in 2003 after its successful New York season (Chaudhuri 2007). 2 The author viewed ‘Animal inside out’ on 13 July 2012; ‘Body worlds’, Melbourne, August 2010.

The second difference was the sparse attendance for London so that there was an unobstructed close encounter – entry had been ticketed with set viewing times to ac- commodate crowds. The third major difference happened through felt responses. As I slowly walked through the exhibition of about 90 bodies and body parts, I began to feel queasy and, by the end, this feeling had turned into mild nausea. This dissipated soon after leaving the exhibit. What produced such a strong physical reaction? The chemical process of plastination replaces body fluids with silicon, acetone and resin, so there could have been something toxic lingering in the environment. Alternatively, did the idea of what was being viewed make me particu- larly sensitive so there was a physical reaction? One metaphor presen- ted itself in the widely used phrase for how a social or psychological realisation is said to make someone ‘sick to the stomach’. The sensory impact of this exhibition of dead animals was experienced through bodily feelings and perhaps arose from a combination of chemical, cul- tural and physiological reactions. Regardless, the unpleasant visceral responses to this exhibition could not be ignored. Although it was human made, the exhibition was like entering an unknown world. An encounter with a plastinated corpse involved standing and confronting an anonymous animal body or body part. The philosophical phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1995) has influenced my approach to the ways that spectators receive body- based performance over two decades and, most recently, in an applica- tion to the reception of trained animal acts (Tait 2012). Merleau-Ponty insightfully theorises the underlying, if under-recognised, physicality of social responsiveness to others. His starting point involves subjective reactions – that is, an impression of individual interiority – followed by the process of perceptually moving outward into the phenomenal world of other bodies and objects. The notion of bodily reaching out is en- capsulated by Merleau-Ponty’s ideas of responses to the movement and action of other bodies, and how a ‘body schemata’ absorbs and rep- licates their ‘motility’. Thus sensory processes denote the reversibility of the visible world. Merleau-Ponty explains about the lack of separa- tion between lived experience and the world around: ‘it would be better to say that the body sensed and the body sentient are as the obverse and the reverse, or again, as two segments of one sole circular course 69 </page> <page sequence="4"> Animal death . . . since the world is flesh’ (1995, 138). These concepts recognise how the separate senses are active conditions and converge so that sight can seem to cross over into touch. This idea of a sensory intertwin- ing with the surrounding world is proposed in an idea of a perceiving body within a visible field (1995, 142). Although Merleau-Ponty (2004) does apply his thinking to human encounters with nonhuman animals, the discussion does not extend to dead animals. Drawing on Merleau- Ponty’s concepts to consider von Hagens’ exhibition, it might be argued that the viewing of dead animals stimulated sensory responses in a viewer that were then internalised in a ‘circular course’. A live body to dead body encounter involved a perceiving sensory body responding to preserved dead flesh. While not necessarily updating ubiquitous taxidermy, von Hagens’ exhibition can certainly be located within the museum tradition of dis- playing animal specimens (Alberti 2011). This may account for the comparatively smaller attendance at the animal anatomy exhibition, since the public are accustomed to seeing animal bodies in natural history museums. Perhaps the entry fee was a barrier – the rest of the museum was free and was crowded and it was only mid-morning. Or it is possible that the exhibition was under-advertised or seemed too educational or lacked the novelty of the human body in ‘Body worlds’. Regardless, von Hagens’ exhibition of animal bodies utilised stands and glass cases as if it were a scientific display which confirmed the blurred distinctions between museum, education and leisure time activity (Macdonald 2011), even though only one exhibit at the end had traces of the quasi-environmental settings frequently used in older- style taxidermy displays. The exhibition was structured one-way so that viewers encountered the exhibits and spaces in a similar order. The spe- cies order was approximately as follows: a squid, an octopus, two shark bodies, a sheep, a goat, a rabbit, a chicken, a duck, three reindeer, a horse head sliced in three and opened out, a second horse body, a goat with a baby, a sequence of organs, two ostriches, an elephant, a giraffe and a gorilla. The organs included animal hearts, a nervous system, a digestive system, brains, testes and a fetus. The two sharks were the first of several dual encounters with the same species body presented in dif- ferent positions and colours: there was a pale cream shark shape and the aforementioned bright red one. 70 </page> <page sequence="5"> 4 Confronting corpses and theatre animals What made this exhibition suitable for such a pre-eminent national history museum? Sharon Macdonald points out that museum practices must cater for plural publics and while concerned with economic vi- ability and competitive prestige, she contends they remain ‘inherently political’ within practices that implicate identity politics (2011, 48). The latter as yet may not fully extend to awareness of the politics of iden- tities in the human–animal hierarchy. Von Hagen’s displays were dead animal bodies without decay, described as anatomy display and presen- ted in a quasi-clinical style, although it was the venue that conveyed an educational purpose. But they might also be contrasted with taxidermy skin and fur displays. In her analysis of von Hagens’ ‘Body worlds’, Jane Desmond (2008) finds that the effect of plastination is the opposite to that sought by taxidermy which preserves the outer skins of dead an- imals in poses within environmental settings to create an illusion of realism. The outer surface is preserved to appear lifelike in fake natural settings. In contrast, plastination reverses the elements on display by showing the preserved innards. The inner substance of an animal body was being presented in ‘Animal inside out’ as either muscles and veins and/or skeletons or capillary and veins with some of an outer layer of skin peeled back. The shark exhibit brought to mind Damien Hirst’s shark in a perspex box, which was, by coincidence, concurrently re- mounted in his retrospective at London’s Tate Modern, although this was a shark’s outer body surface.3 Called The physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living (1991), it was supposed to evoke fear, and it certainly had sensationalist impact even though the title suggests a philosophical dead end whereby the perception of the viewer cannot reach beyond the embodied physicality of living. The purpose of this type of dead animal exhibition still remains ambiguous. Irrespect- ive of the ethical validity of continuing to put dead bodies on show in museums (Alberti 2011) or art galleries (Baker 2006), the deadness in ‘Animal inside out’ even in a natural history museum seemed excessive. The exhibition was outside common social anthropomorphic re- lations and their compartmentalised encounters. Plastination removed the familiar surface of the animal body, the habitual sight and site of encounters between species. Stark moments with an animal body that 3 The author viewed it in the exhibition ‘Damien Hirst’ at Tate Modern on 12 July 2012. 71 </page> <page sequence="6"> Animal death looked so completely different obliterated familiar habituated responses derived from repeated exposure to animal images in representation de- signed to arouse selective emotional feelings. This presented an inverse too: the shark swimming freely in television programs about sea life; filmed sheep, horse or goat grazing calmly on a farmed spacious land- scape; and the highly photographed African elephant roaming open plains (Chris 2006). Only the iconic misunderstood and endangered species, the gorilla, was given touches of a setting, posed marooned on a small collection of twigs, a token concession that seemed especially misplaced. The elephant exhibit was like encountering a new species. Cultural images of these animal species were turned inside out. While dead bodies exhibited over decades in museums seemed to have provided minimal challenge to human control over animal lives, ‘Animal inside out’ brought questions about the origins of the animals and the quality of their life to the fore. A whole body needed to be pro- cessed prior to decomposition, and therefore soon after death, and this must have been organised because the exhibition presented a mixture of domesticated and wild animal species. Was someone merely waiting for the animals to die naturally? The domestication of animal species might produce a false impression that the human utility of animals was justifiable – and perhaps life on a farm did eventually suit some bred species. But as Harriet Ritvo points out in her essays on domestica- tion, ‘anthropomorphism is problematic, since it implicitly disparages the possibility that humans and nonhumans share perceptions, beha- viours, and responses’ (2010, 8, original emphasis). Yet paradoxically, anthropomorphic projection about animals can also lead to the notion of sameness so that the assumed right of humans to control the life and death of other animal species comes unravelled. Thus humans would no longer have the unquestioned right to put animal bodies on display for leisure activities. The reddened muscle and discoloured white fat was contained in- side a body shape which made each animal species easily recognisable. Some were posed as if ready for action, which in itself drew the eye. The sensory impact of viewing exposed fat and muscle substances was compounded by the great diversity of the body shapes that contained them. Could this exhibition also disrupt habitual patterns of perceiving other species bodily? Drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s argument that the embodied subject is engaged in a continual process of sensing the ex- 72 </page> <page sequence="7"> 4 Confronting corpses and theatre animals ternal world, it is clear that an observing body was confronted with an animal body shape that was additionally revealing inside substances of muscle, bone and veins. The process of perceiving, bodily, was poten- tially turned inside out. In his exploration of the phenomenology of human and animal living body encounters, Ralph Acampora explains that humans are aware that they are most vulnerable at a somatic level through acci- dents, injuries and illness within life, but that this awareness should facilitate the development of more positive ongoing human–animal relations (2006, 130). What happens when somatic awareness is con- fronted with the converse situation of animal death? Perhaps such an encounter is better able to remind humans of somatic vulnerability. In both ‘Body worlds’ and ‘Animal inside out’, viewers were being confron- ted by somatic stasis; the living body had been turned into an inert object. The encounter with a range of three-dimensional shapes seemed to increase an impression of catering to ghoulish human voyeurism as viewers moved in, amongst and around variously large and small flayed exhibits. These were like an extension of the creations of repulsive nightmares in horror films. But the plastination preservation process manipulated an encounter with deadness so that this was cognitively recognisable but viscerally chilling because it was outside everyday sensibility. It compelled attention but seemed to obviate empathetic re- sponses. Exhibits were repulsive and did not spark emotional sympathy. The red blood effect intermittently looms large in memory. The effort to display the multitude of criss-crossed veins of an individual animal with a red dye resin had a powerful sensory impact. A viewer was being shown how blood was contained in the veins, in a hyper- realist impression. Vivid brightness, contradictorily, signifies vitality in blood. Viewed within the severed dead body shape, it was as if this was the fresh red blood of the newly killed animal, cut open. It had the effect of suggesting that the viewer was encountering the animal soon after death and might be complicit in the animal’s death. Did a viewer’s pulse rate change in this process of looking at dead animals? The multiple ways in which the internal movement of blood is subjectively experienced was potentially confronted within a sensory enfolding of a bloodied corpse. Such a pulsating blood to static blood encounter might make for uncomfortable and stomach-churning sen- sations. 73 </page> <page sequence="8"> Animal death The exhibition space was a repulsive world filled with dead anim- als. The intention of ‘Animal inside out’ was unclear beyond the premise that humanity has the right to display the dead remains of other species for its own leisure activity – such exhibitions need to be challenged at a broad societal level. Although it was probably not the intended out- come, by exposing what is not seen, the exhibition had the potential to bodily upset at an individual level and potentially confirms a similar potency arising from the viewing of photographic and media images of animal death. The unseen way that animals live and die in the human social world was inverted through focused attention on dead animals. Sensory aversion and repulsion may usefully jolt viewers into a differ- ent type of awareness. Theatre fakes Can the use of replica animal bodies, which would seem to be the more ethical practice, deliver comparable impact? The ways in which two original productions in Australian theatre with pro-animal politics spe- cifically depicted dead animals is discussed below and contextualised in relation to comparative examples that used animal replicas. Anim- als can be represented directly or indirectly in theatre since the idea of an animal species can be present when the animal body is absent. Sim- ilarly ideas of animal death can be conveyed through the dialogue or with an object prop which is made to appear realistic. The two theat- rical depictions focused on dead animals were coincidentally produced around the same time. The plays bring questions about dead animals in human lives to the fore, even though the purpose of each diverged; The call by Patricia Cornelius (2009) was orientated to disadvantaged hu- mans working in an abattoir and Letters from animals by Kit Lazaroo was primarily centred on animal extinction. The works are discussed here because their content, and their respective intriguing, if somewhat flawed, small innovative productions highlight divergent approaches to staging dead animals in theatre. The longstanding aesthetic problem of whether to theatrically rep- resent the animal body onstage, alive or dead, was compounded by the invention of turn-of-the-20th-century naturalism in theatre that demands a lifelike visual realism. Australian theatre adopted these 74 </page> <page sequence="9"> 4 Confronting corpses and theatre animals European and English theatre traditions. While productions of Henrik Ibsen’s (1999) The wild duck from the late 19th century could conveni- ently use spoken dialogue to refer to shot ducks and a living captive duck off stage, Anton Chekhov’s (1991) ironic response with The seagull requires a shot bird onstage, and has been commonly staged with a real- istic prop. But throughout the 19th century, a variety of domesticated animal species had been integral to the traditional circus dominated by equestrian acts, and circus animal acts regularly appeared on theatre stages along with the acts by human impersonators of animals. Al- though 20th-century realist theatre dispensed with live animal acts, the range of animal species in circus increased greatly with the addition of trained wild animals from the 1890s and, despite ongoing pro-animal opposition, circus continues to present animals performing human- derived action (Tait 2012). Animal performance was theatrically con- structed to provoke a range of emotions from fear and excitement to delight and amusement. Meanwhile, the presence and social function of animals became oblique in 20th-century modernist theatre that depic- ted symbols and metaphors through dialogue. It should be noted that drama about environmental issues might also be tracked back to Chek- hov’s (1991) Uncle Vanya, first staged in 1898, although it implies that the farming of animals was part of the growing problem of deforesta- tion. With several notable exceptions, modernist drama was generally preoccupied with the human condition and avoided troublesome issues of how to stage animals, live or fake. An encounter with a replica of a life-size rhinoceros that was cre- ated for a 2007 London production of Eugene Ionesco’s modernist absurdist play of the same name, and retained within a museum, fur- ther illustrates the comparison here between ‘Animal inside out’ and the impact of animals in Australian realist theatre.4 In this instance, the rhinoceros would probably have been a surprising and strange ar- rival on stage since the play has the metaphoric rhinoceros represented only with heads, and the incongruity of full bodily presence would have focused audience attention. Fake animal bodies in theatre can have a striking impact. Since the outer body of this replica seemed almost 4 The author viewed this exhibit in the Theatre section of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, 13 July 2012. Rhinoceros, translated by M Crimp, was in the repertory of the Royal Court Theatre in the second half of 2007. 75 </page> <page sequence="10"> Animal death real with the simulation of the colour and texture of the animal’s hide, the theatrical imperative to fabricate a rhinoceros body to seem lifelike might be compared to that of taxidermy’s preservation of outer skins. But an extended encounter with the rhinoceros was neither sickening nor mired in complex ethical conflicts. Instead a close encounter with a three-dimensional large grey replica of the species body was enjoyable. The use of a replica in human entertainment might draw attention to the species, but, paradoxically, such substitution could also be counter- productive for the living animal. Conversely the utility of actual animals for viewing can breach ethical limits although theatre still does not gen- erally challenge these limits. In a realist production of Patricia Cornelius’ The call in Melbourne in 2007, dead animal bodies were realistically replicated.5 The produc- tion’s minimalist staging with plastic crates and no set only deviated in two scenes in an abattoir, when it showed a row of dead animal car- casses on a factory line. Regardless of the visual effectiveness of these replica dead bodies, the assembly line was a memorable feature of the production. The call is about young people in small town Australia who leave school early with limited social options – the women are often pregnant, and the men work in factories. In a narrative about the char- acter Gary’s conversion to Islam, the male characters take drugs and treat work in an abattoir or on a caged chicken farm as interchange- able with other factory work, although the killing of animals has the lowest status. The increasing scale of the industrial production of an- imals for meat consumption relies on less skilled or migrant labour (Burt 2006). In the pro-animal politics of this play, the slaughtering of animals provided a commentary on human disadvantage, the trap of poverty, and different religious attitudes so that the dead animal replica was symbolic of a social convergence of human and animal misery. The production’s meat assembly line was visually prominent but not somatically potent. Prop replicas of birds, fish and animals in theatre represent realness that can be cognitively appreciated but de- liver only limited bodily impact. It is possible to speculate that the replica might actually negate reactions to deadness, since the idea of realness can be received without visceral confrontation. 5 The author viewed The call at the Fairfax Studio, 23 November 2007. This was produced by the Melbourne Workers’ Theatre and directed by Andrea James. 76 </page> <page sequence="11"> 4 Confronting corpses and theatre animals Live animals are once again appearing on stage in theatre and in contemporary performance, and with some ethically questionable practices in the latter (Orozco 2013), although without feats and tricks as once happened. The comparable absence of animals in modernist visual art that was discerned by John Berger had been reversed in postmodern visual art some years earlier and often with live animals (Baker 2000). Theatrical attention has slowly turned to the question of the animal, and species identities across performance forms including circus (Chaudhuri 2007 [Derrida]; Peterson 2007; Tait 2012). An an- imal might be a subsidiary element within a human story in theatre, but some precedents with a horse or dogs generate complex com- mentaries (Kelleher, Ridout, Castellucci, Guidi &amp; Castellucci 2007). Consequently it is probably not surprising to find an Australian Belvoir St Theatre production of The wild duck in 2011–12, directed by Chris Ryan, presenting a living duck on stage. The production had a set with a glass wall between the audience and performers, and the Melbourne season coincided with the opening of the duck-hunting season in Vict- oria.6 Live animals standing on stage might seem like objectification for human voyeurism or at least a sensationalist gesture, but an animal body on stage is a truer depiction of a species and invariably takes the complete focus away from human performers. This stage presence may serve to heighten the visibility of the species outside the theatre. Jane Goodall (2008) explores ideas of how intangible human pres- ence is recognised within theatre texts historically but suggests that this concept can only be grasped through ideas of embodiment. Her ex- ploration of human presence indirectly provides one justification, if not necessarily a strong one, for the bodied presence of animals in theatre. But animal presence raises a conundrum in relation to the ethics of presenting live animals in an environment such as theatre with several hundred people that might sensorily and bodily upset an animal in or- der to fulfill a larger purpose of drawing attention to the plight of the species. While contemporary performance and visual art has returned to presenting live animals in an era when new circus has rejected animal 6 The author viewed the production at the Malthouse Theatre, 6 March 2012, and reviewed it for the Australian Animal Studies Group AASG Bulletin March 2012. 77 </page> <page sequence="12"> Animal death performers, most theatre continues to eschew the dead animal of ritual and rite associated with its founding early Greek theatre. The dead an- imal remains a ghostly offstage presence. Animal absence It is difficult to gauge the extent to which 21st-century theatre and per- formance practitioners accommodate contemporary attitudes to living animals and the politics of speciesism (Singer 1995; Cavalieri 2001), and grapple with developments in the fraught politics of ethical rela- tions (Sunstein &amp; Nussbaum 2004). To date, clear responses in Aus- tralia only seem apparent in theatre texts that consider the future. The fish (prop) falling out of the desert sky at the start of Andrew Bovell’s (2008) When the rain stops falling signals the effect of climate change sometime in the future without elaboration. In Kit Lazaroo’s futuristic play, Letters from animals, most animal species have become extinct.7 This narrative countenancing the death of other species is imbued with loss and grief. Lazaroo’s play suggests that the issue of species survival is an ex- tremely urgent one. Letters from animals comments directly on animal lives and practices in the present by forecasting a future in which hu- man acquisitive aggression and animal disease eradication have had apocalyptic consequences in an environmental disaster that obliterates nearly all other animal species. It also indirectly suggests that the deadly implications of climate change for other species are often obscured by human preoccupation with the impact on its own kind. In a female- only future, lone scientist Queenie, living in a house flooded by a river, resists the inquisitive questions of the bureaucrat Shelley, from the Ministry of Satisfaction, but she is deceived into handing over her precious collection of bird bones by the youthful and completely devious Gretel. Human performers also personify the voices of the remembered scavenger cockroach, rat and vulture, species metaphor- 7 The author viewed Letters from animals at the Storeroom, 25 November 2007.

But in the extreme circumstances whereby some humans live on, they join the species associated with death. Over the other side of the river is a secret renegade laboratory that attempts to preserve remnants of other species and even bring some to life. Queenie has managed to hide the smallest of life forms to release into the river, which does promise renewal if not necessarily hope for hu- mans; human survival is limited by the sludge that must be pumped out of habited areas. The interdependency of species becomes a transparent point. In this apocalyptic world, humans have lost more than the words for animals and knowledge about them, they have lost their freedom along with their imaginative and creative capacity – the longstanding way in which animals embody human thinking and emotional feeling. The play crystallises fears for the future by taking to a logical conclu- sion the warning that, unless humans change, there will be devastating consequences. Absence is central to the narrative because it is about biodiversity and species loss and animal death. Hence the embodied presence of animals in human worlds was emphasised through bodily absence. The purpose of Letters from animals was to draw attention to the obliteration of other species. As well as the vulture, rat and cockroach voices, the theatrical staging included quirky oversized, cardboard two- dimensional animal, insect and bird shapes to make a post-apocalyptic world explicit. In production, the play could have been much shorter without losing its significance and some staging choices needed revisit- ing, but strong performances brought the unimaginable implications of the futuristic world to the fore. The performers climbed over upturned buckets and angled surfaces in a precarious way to visually reinforce their condition. The design conveyed a return to everyday manual tech- nologies and equipment that were not fuel-dependent, although pumps still kept the black chemical sludge away until they began breaking down at the play’s end as the most deadly species was gradually killing itself. Animal impersonation is a further (and longstanding) option alongside these other representational modes. The 21st-century return to a human playing an animal suggests an alternative strategy used in theatre, contemporary performance and visual arts to deliver species presence but obviate detrimental effects of using animals. An anthropo- morphic rendition of an animal body by a human performer may seem 79 </page> <page sequence="14"> Animal death like a reasonable response to ethical concern about presenting living animals to make a point. In 2007, performance artist Mark Wallinger won the Turner Award, Britain’s top contemporary art award, for Sleeper, in which he wandered around an art gallery in a brown bear costume for two and a half hours (The Australian, 5 December 2007, 3). If incongruous visibility was central to this performance suggesting a bedroom world of dreams, it also evoked social fondness for cuddly (replica) toy bears, although any reference to the plight of living bears was probably more oblique. Further, the pervasive social expectation that animals in representation embody human emotional feelings may circumvent a strategy of attracting attention to living animals. In the 2010 production of Jenny Kemp’s Kitten, sea species were presented through recorded sound and a polar bear played by a human appeared in a teasing ironic depiction that evoked human fondness for images of white bears. Kemp’s oeuvre spans theatre and contemporary per- formance and is often inspired by visual art (Varney 2011). In this performance text, the central figure is the ex-singer, Kitten, a widow grieving for her partner, Jonah, who has gone missing at sea. Jonah researched whales and other species, and the spoken text of Kitten is about environmental destruction and species survival. As it follows the trajectory of the female character’s grief for Jonah, it unfolds an idea of human grief over other species. Given that this production was titled Kitten, emblematic of an extremely anthropomorphised domesticated species, and there were frequent references to other species throughout as well as recorded whale calls and the appearance of a polar bear, it is surprising to encounter minimal or only passing comment on these theatricalised animals in some responses to the performance.8 It was as if the animal species went unnoticed in a human-centric focus that missed the point. Why? It is possible this was due to the way that the human story highlighted emotions, and Kitten’s grief and trauma over 8 See M Pereira, review of Kitten [Online].

Varney acknowledges the bear as a manifestation of Kitten’s bipolar mental health (2011, 226). 80 </page> <page sequence="15"> 4 Confronting corpses and theatre animals the death of her husband was unmistakable. A performance of grief over the death of a family member might be unquestioningly accepted as socially gendered, and this was the dominant emotional motif in the narrative. Perhaps these emotional dynamics completely overshadowed haunting animal audio presence for some spectators and the implicit inference of madness and grief over animal death. As well, the pro- jection of human emotions onto animals may become literalised with animal impersonation. The examples given here confirm that when animal species are made the central identities in a dramatic world, they are hard to miss. But even where there was a meaningful commentary about animals, as- sociated with strong emotional responses between human characters, animals did not necessarily become the focus of attention. The evoc- ation of emotional responses on behalf of animals may be unreliable. While emotion is connected to body-based feelings, and although emo- tions are embodied and objectified within larger social patterns, spe- cific emotional feelings remain unpredictable in their evocation and interpretation. Human emotions may even obscure animal identity. While sensory effects can have a body-based impact, connections between reasoning and physiologies of feeling are not automatic. Un- challenged, habitual patterns of emotional responses to animal species who embody human emotions may continue to distort responses (Tait 2012). Emotional narratives cannot be assumed to maximise attention for animal species because of how animals have been habitually assim- ilated into human social worlds in representation and surrounded with human emotional feelings. Conclusion Where theatre continues to present animals integrated into human worlds through its stories and framed by the emotional expression arising from spoken word delivery, they remain abstract symbolic and metaphoric entities. They continue to be enveloped by human emotions as theatre’s anthropomorphic processes camouflage the separate worlds inhabited by animals. Some contemporary performance has turned attention to embodied presence and it is hoped that this might be in- dicative of a larger pattern of orientation in society which lessens the 81 </page> <page sequence="16"> Animal death need to repeatedly present living animals. The urgent issue of species survival requires all possible interventions. The experience of ‘Animal inside out’ was quite different to that of seeing lifeless replicas in theatre productions or cognitively interpreting animal identities without embodied presence in dramatic narratives. It was impossible to avoid the issue of animal death, even though the exhibition’s intention was unclear. The human was placed in a world filled with animals – albeit one fabricated by humans – which turned around how species remain unseen in a human world. The exhibition disrupted the familiar process of pleasant viewing and thus, paradox- ically, increased awareness of animals. A species-to-species encounter happens with and through lived body experience and, as argued here, a body-to-body encounter can be surmised to also happen at a level of physiological responses. Bodily confronting an actual animal body, dead or alive, potentially resists the emotional processes of species con- flation. The body-based habitual pattern of calm, pleasant responses if not stronger, affectionate responses to images of animals was com- pletely obscured by three-dimensional grotesque bodies without skins.
