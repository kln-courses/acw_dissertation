Their analysis is vulnerable to criticism from two directions. First, it is difficult to test its plausibility against the wider characteristics of Upper Palaeolithic society. Not only has the art been interpreted in numerous different ways already, but little is known about the activities of the contemporary population apart from their methods of food production. Moreover, the chronology of the art is not well enough understood for any changes in its character to be assessed against other developments dur- ing this period. The case rests on global constants, and at present it cannot be tested archaeologically. The second difficulty is that Upper Palaeolithic art contains a strik- ing mixture of the abstract and the naturalistic, and in- terpretations that focus primarily on the significance of the signs inevitably place less weight on the more real- istic depictions that have dominated most of the discus- sion. Lewis-Williams and Dowson do not shirk these problems, but the very mixed character of the art may mean that it does not provide the ideal material for this kind of study. For that reason it might be profitable to consider a different archaeological example. Megalithic art, which is known from a series of stone-built monuments (pas- sage tombs) from Iberia to northern Scotland, has proved almost as intractable as Palaeolithic art, but at least the outlines of a sequence do exist (Shee Twohig I98I). This allows the character of this material to be interpreted in relation to wider developments in the archaeological record. In some cases specific objects depicted in tomb art can be identified among surviving artefacts, and their contexts can be studied. In other cases motifs that char- acterise megalithic art may have been deployed in other media, allowing judicious study of their wider associa- tions. Most important, the sequence of megalithic art provides a partial contrast between early naturalistic de- pictions and later more abstract images that have much in common with the signs studied by Lewis-Williams and Dowson. The following account focusses on the art in two distinct regions. First, it traces the transition from a mainly naturalistic to a more abstract art in southern Brittany in relation to the changing character of prehistoric society in that area; secondly, it considers the use of a more abstract art style in the Boyne Valley in Ireland and the selective adoption of similar motifs in other media across the British Isles (fig. I). The se- quences overlap to some extent, and at one stage there may have been direct links between them. The first runs from about 4900 B.C. to about 3200 B.C. and the second from around 3400 to 2400 B.C. Megalithic art in Brittany went through two main stages, the first of which can be subdivided. It is the art of that earlier phase which is considered here (Shee Twohig I98I:49-50). A few examples are found on the upright stones known as menhirs, but the greater part of this material is found with monumental stone-built tombs, where it occurs inside the burial chamber or in the passage that communicates with the outside world. .V. ORKNEY * R. BOYNE- WESSEX BR I TTANY FIG. i. The location of the study areas. Art is not known around the exterior of the mounds or cairns that cover these structures, and unlike its counterparts in Spain and Portugal (pp. I3-38) it is located mainly in areas of the monument that would not have received direct sunlight. Some years ago Renfrew (I976) suggested that the megalithic tombs concentrated along the "Atlantic facade" of Europe may have acted as territorial markers for agricultural communities whose expansion into new areas had been checked by it. The interpretation has its attractions, but more recent opinion has favoured the view that agriculture is as likely to have been adopted by local populations of hunter-gatherers, who obtained the necessary domesticates by exchange with communities further inland (Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy I986:70- 73). During the Mesolithic period southern Brittany must have been an exceptionally productive area, com- bining extensive tracts of pasture with equally produc- tive marine resources around a series of estuaries. There may have been little pressure to adopt domestic plants and animals until that favourable balance was upset, perhaps by the gradual rise in sea level that culminated about 5000 B.C. (Hibbs i984:274-75). At the same time, there already seems to be evidence for collective burial, in some cases accompanied by grave goods and covered by small stone structures (Giot, L'Helgouac'h, and Mon- nier I979:I30-37). This is a particular feature of what</page><page sequence="3">70 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY gt :~~~~~~~3 FIG. 2. "Naturalistic" images in Breton megalithic art. i, bow; 2, "yoke"; 3, axe-heads; 4, "axe plough"; 5, ?boat; 6, "shepherd's crook"; 7, ?anthropomorph; 8-iO, hafted axes (after Shee Twohig I98I). are described as "complex" hunter-gatherers (see Price and Brown I985, Clark and Neeley i987). Even if the precise context for the adoption of domes- ticates remains unknown, the evidence of the earliest art is revealing of links between the population, the land, and the food supply (fig. 2). With one major exception, to be considered later, this art comprises naturalistic or more schematic depictions of axes (both hafted and un- hafted), bows and arrows, so-called shepherds' crooks, and possibly ploughs (Shee Twohig i98i:54-64). In addi- tion, Le Roux (i984:243-44) has recently suggested that the U-shaped symbols sometimes identified as yokes may depict the horns of a large bovid-an interpretation supported by the recent discovery of a carving of two such animals on a reused menhir. More controversial is the identification of boats on two of the sites (Shee Twohig i98i:63-64). This art is not peculiar to the tombs, occurring on occasional menhirs. Indeed, Le Roux (i982, i984) argues that the depiction of the "axe plough" and of axe-heads in distinctive sheaths was a feature of menhirs rather than of chambered tombs. The axe symbols may allow us to set the art in a wider context. The Gulf of Morbihan region has one of the highest densities of finds of polished axes of any part of Brittany, even though some were made of non-local raw materials (Cogne and Giot i952:fig. I). Precisely the same area also has the main concentration of depictions of hafted and unhafted axes (Shee Twohig i98i:38-75). Of particular importance are those that portray the axe- heads inside elaborate sheaths (Le Roux I982). All too little is known about the contexts in which the axes have been discovered, but already it is clear that a num- ber had been deposited intentionally, sometimes in small hoards. In addition to the complex chambered tombs, a second type of burial mound is recorded. These tertres tumu- laires consist of elongated mounds covering a series of small stone boxes or "cists" that are thought to have contained human remains, together with small num- bers of axe-heads (Biot, L'Helgouac'h, and Monnier I979:2i2-I8). These miniature burial chambers were not decorated and were inaccessible once the mound had been constructed. Some of the tertres tumulaires were accompanied by menhirs, and around the base of one of these was a group of stone axe-heads set in the ground with their blades uppermost (Le Rouzic, Pequart, and Pequart I923:68-70). In each case it seems as if the early phase of Breton art was dominated by symbols peculiarly appropriate to the new mode of production. Axes and axe ploughs could reflect the importance of clearing and working the land; the bovids and possibly the shepherds' crooks may relate to the changing use of livestock; and the bows and the possible ships may refer to the continued use of natural resources. So important were these considerations that axe-heads themselves may have been imbued with spe- cial properties. A number were made in exotic raw mate- rials, and many were ceremoniously deposited. If mega- lithic tombs served as territorial markers, so did the early menhirs; indeed, a few had axes or possible ploughs carved on them (Shee Twohig I98I:67-68). The use of the same images in megalithic tombs links these sym-</page><page sequence="4">Volume 30, Number i, February I989 | 7I bols of place to the world of the ancestors. As Renfrew suggests, these monuments could have played a part in the definition of territory. Both in the early tombs and on two of the menhirs there is a further symbol that probably had an anthro- pomorphic significance (pp. 60-63). This became more important in the later part of this sequence. At the same time there were gradual changes in the form taken by megalithic tombs (L'Helgouac'h i965). They became generally larger and employed more massive stones in their construction. The chambers sometimes increased in size and could show greater internal elaboration, in- cluding the creation of a number of separate compart- ments. Side cells might also be added to the passages. The main effect of all these changes was that the art inside these structures was not always easy to locate and in any event would have needed deliberate lighting. The art belonging to this phase did not eschew the naturalistic symbols discussed already, but it sur- rounded them with a far wider array of non-repre- sentational designs, almost all of which can be matched in Lewis-Williams and Dowson's account of entoptic phenomena (figs. 3 and 4). These later motifs are gener- ally bigger and bolder than their predecessors (Shee Twohig 198I:53). A clear demonstration of this change comes from the spectacular decorated tomb of Gavrinis, although it should be emphasised that in some respects this site is not typical of the region as a whole. Here the art appears to be of two distinct phases (pp. I 72-7 5). The earlier includes some of the motifs discussed already, including a bow, a whole series of arrows, and a hafted axe. The later includes further axe-heads (of a distinctive type to be considered later) and elaborate abstract pat- terns including parallel curving lines, nested arcs, and spirals (fig 5). On other sites the art is generally less elaborate, but here again the naturalistic symbols that originated in the first phase can be found amidst a range of abstract designs. Among these, anthropomorphic im- ages play a prominent role. Again these developments can be set in a wider con- text. There has been the dramatic discovery that frag- ments of earlier menhirs had been incorporated into these tombs. During excavation at Gavrinis it was realised that joining fragments of the same decorated stone had been used in building that tomb and La Table des Marchands, 4 km away (Le Roux i984). This menhir had depicted two bovids, a shepherd's crook, a hafted axe, and an axe plough. Other reused stones at Gavrinis depicted hafted axes and an axe-head in a special sheath. Several other instances of the reuse of earlier menhirs have been suggested (L'Helgouac'h I983). Such discoveries seem to suggest that earlier symbols of place were not being destroyed but being purposefully incorporated into more complex monuments to the dead. Although the chronological evidence leaves much to be desired, it seems possible that this was also hap- pening to some of the objects depicted on those stones. Gavrinis includes depictions of a distinctive form of axe- head with an expanded cutting edge and others with a hole bored through the butt for suspension. Exactly these types of axe, often made of exotic raw materials, have been discovered in a second series of burial mounds around the Gulf of Morbihan, where they occur in very large numbers associated with an exceptional quantity of personal ornaments. These monuments are known as the Carnac tumuli, after one of the most prominent ex- amples (Giot, L'Helgouac'h, and Monnier I979:2i8-25), and they differ from the normal pattern in that there is no passage communicating between the central chamber and the outside world; nor, with one minor exception, is there any art on these sites. Their chronology remains poorly defined, but they may be much more elaborate versions of the tertres tumulaires. Sometimes they may have incorporated the remains of earlier chambered tombs in much the same way as they contain parts of older menhirs. It seems as if the axes and other artefacts found in these burials reflected the status of the de- ceased and were regarded as valuables (Bender i985:33- 34). Whereas the builders of some of these monuments appropriated parts of earlier menhirs and the symbols depicted on them, at other sites the objects themselves were accumulated in great numbers. The link between developed passage-grave art and the Carnac tumuli is strengthened by the recent suggestion that the capstone beneath one of these mounds was part of a reused menhir another fragment of which was used at Gavrinis (Le Roux i984). The tumulus in question was the site of Er-Grah, an elongated mound whose southern terminus may have been marked by an enormous monolith, Le Grand Menhir Brise. A recent study suggests that it broke dur- ing erection, and it now lies on the ground in four pieces (Hornsey i987). The stone probably weighed over 300 tons and should have stood to a height of 2o m. Its surfaces had been carefully dressed, and, apart from the base, which would have been concealed by the socket, its form is that of the finest axe-heads found in the area (cf. Bishop et al. I977:figs. i and 2). It shares their dis- tinctive profile and their tapering butt; even its cross section is a feature of these artefacts. The resemblance is only emphasised by the carving of an axe plough on the monolith (Shee Twohig i98i:fig. I7'). It seems to oc- cupy a pivotal position in the pattern of change. It is perhaps the ultimate successor of the menhirs erected beside the tertres tumulaires, and it combines the "public" symbols represented by the menhirs with the less accessible depictions of axe-heads found in the chambered tombs. It may also be a reference to the types of grave offering deposited beneath the Carnac mounds. The builders of those mounds closed the burials off from contact with the world outside. By contrast, the chambered tombs remained accessible for a considerable period, and it is here that we seem to find so much imag- ery of the kinds described by Lewis-Williams and Dow- son. Not only does some of the art within these tombs recall the entoptic phenomena they depict, but the c%hanges that had been made to the design of these tombs would all have facilitated the development of trance conditions. The passages could have side compartments, and the chambers were sometimes larger and inter-</page><page sequence="5">72 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY ENTOPTIC PHENOMENA SAN COSO l A | B | C ___ v v% * 4 gm Entoptic phenomena compared with images in San and Coso art (after Lewis-Williams and nally subdivided. This meant that in most cases the art was hidden from daylight; moreover, it was found in areas which probably contained human remains. At the same time, it may not be too fanciful to suggest that a powerful symbolic link existed between the artefacts de- picted on the walls and those accumulated in the burials beneath the Carnac mounds. In one case the depictions of those objects were accessible but were encapsulated in complex designs involving entoptic imagery (fig. 5). In the other case the objects themselves were buried in large numbers with the dead and were covered by enor- mous mounds. Here art was virtually unrepresented, and the burial chambers were inaccessible. By this means a social elite could have distanced itself from the rest of the population and merged its distinctive material cul- ture with the imagery of another world. An initial con- cern with the land and its fertility may have been di- verted into a concern with the supernatural. Earlier menhirs, and even small chambered tombs, could be reused in both groups of monument, and the axes that were such a major feature of the early art style were increasingly employed as grave goods. At the same time, the passage tombs that had started as monuments to the dead may increasingly have served as sanctuaries, and it may be no accident that some of them contain strange anthropomorphic images. The passage tomb at Gavrinis shows links with the monuments in the Boyne Valley, 700 km to the north. Many writers have recognised increasingly strong links between Ireland and other regions during the Neolithic sequence (Bradley and Chapman I982, Sheridan I986), but the art of Gavrinis seems to have particularly close connections with the decorated tombs of Newgrange (O'Kelly I982) and Knowth (Eogan I986). Both are com- plex chambered tombs set beneath enormous mounds. Although some of the motifs in the Irish tomb art are also found in southern Brittany, significant differences may be observed. Much of the Irish art is found on the external kerbs around these monuments and would have been visible in the open air. Again, the evidence for an- thropormorphic imagery similar to that in the Breton tombs is equivocal. Even so, the distinctive artefacts</page><page sequence="6">Volume 3o, Number i, February I989 | 73 MEGALITHIC ART BRITTANY IRELAND E F G H en.., 1. t Images comparable to Lewis- Williams and Dowson 's in Breton and Irish megalith found on the Irish sites do suggest that communities in that area were capitalising on their links with far-off areas. At different times there have been claims that the Irish art includes solar and anthropomorphic motifs (Bren- nan I983; O'Sullivan i986:8i-82), but for the most part it is made up of abstract designs almost all of which again reflect the entoptic imagery discussed by Lewis- Williams and Dowson (figs. 3 and 4). It has a much stron- ger emphasis on geometric designs than the Breton art, and circular and spiral motifs are more frequent. There do not seem to be any naturalistic images of the types discussed in Brittany. For this reason it is not possible to offer any "reading" of these signs, but some patterning has been recognised in their distribution within the ma- jor monuments (Eogan I986:I46-95). This is particu- larly true in the Boyne Valley, where angular and rec- tilinear designs are most frequent inside the main chambered tombs at Knowth and in the area around their entrances; this also applies to combinations of an- gular designs with spiral motifs. More isolated spirals may be found both inside and outside these tombs, but other curvilinear designs characterise the more accessi- ble art on the exterior of the monument. This distinc- tion is less clear-cut at the neighbouring site of New- grange, but a broadly similar pattern can still be observed. It is perhaps significant that the Breton in- fluence was strongest among the motifs decorating the external kerbs, which represent the "public" face of these monuments. The distinctive contribution of the Irish evidence lies in the translation of the entoptic images into other media. Chambered tombs of the variety found in the Boyne Valley have counterparts in the British Isles and in Scandinavia, but megalithic art is sparsely repre- sented. One area in which it is present, albeit on a lim- ited scale, is in Orkney, where a major series of stone- built tombs has been the focus of intensive research. This is one of the few areas of Europe in which it is possible to relate these tombs directly to a group of con- temporary settlements and ceremonial centres, and this means that we can show how the characteristic reper-</page><page sequence="7">74 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY I ~ FIG. 5. Three decorated stones from Gavrinis (after Shee Twohig I98I), with details of the naturalistic images employed. toire of megalithic art underwent a striking transforma- tion. Whilst it was fairly rare in the chambered tombs of this area, some of the same motifs are found incised on house walls in the contemporary settlements (Shee Twohig I 9 8 I: 2 3 8- 3 9). More important, a number of the same motifs (fig. 3, IH, IVG, IVH, VG, VIG, and VIH) characterise a new range of ceramics, Grooved Ware, which is found in these settlements and in the cere- monial centres of Orkney (Wainwright and Longworth I97I:235-54; Shee Twohig i98i:i126-27). This transformation is particularly striking because Grooved Ware was not the only ceramic style used in Orkney during this period. Here two distinct traditions ran in parallel, each with its own associations. These extended not just to portable artefacts but also to styles of monument (Hedges i983:29i-99; Fraser I983:I80- 83). Between about 3000 and 2400 B.C. the Grooved Ware tradition was gradually adopted over a much wider area, extending from the Scottish mainland to central south- em England. It remained quite separate from the pottery styles found in these regions and was used on both set- tlements and ceremonial sites. It was associated with a range of portable artefacts, some of which may have en- joyed an equally restricted currency (Wainwright and Longworth I 9 7 I 2 5 4-6 5). There have been several attempts to explain the inde- pendence of those who were using Grooved Ware, but none is entirely satisfactory. Since Grooved Ware is of- ten associated with artefacts of exotic origin, it might have been used by a social elite that maintained its inde- pendence through the operation of ranked spheres of ex- change (Bradley i982); alternatively, since it is the domi- nant style at so many ceremonial sites of this period, it may have been associated with ritual specialists (Thorpe and Richards I984). It is clear, however, that one of the major factors that maintained the distinctive character of this pottery was its unusual decoration, which it occa- sionally shares with other portable objects (Simpson and Thawley I972). Such evidence has been studied in most detail in cen- tral southern England (Wessex), where large quantities of Grooved Ware have been discovered in a series of mas- sive earthwork enclosures interpreted as ceremonial centres. Detailed intra-site analysis has shown that the distribution of pottery on these sites is related to inten- tional deposits of other kinds of material. There seems to be a direct relationship between the complexity of Grooved Ware designs and the character of the artefacts found with pottery of this type (Richards and Thomas i984). Even the animal bones excavated in different areas of these sites seem to reflect this patterning. Sherds carrying particular Grooved Ware motifs have sometimes been linked with specific points in the layout of a monument. Thus in Wessex circular motifs ulti- mately related to those employed in megalithic art tend to be associated with the entrances to these sites (R. Cleal, personal communication). Such a pattern perhaps recalls the organisation of the different motifs on the kerbs of the Boyne chambered tombs. At the same time, a very different approach to this material has also high- lighted the significance of decorated Grooved Ware. There is often evidence that broken pottery was mended by the provision of repair holes, but recent work has shown that the number of repairs observed on Grooved Ware greatly outstrips those on other contemporary ceramics, even the most lavishly decorated (Cleal n.d.). Again this seems to imply that this particular group had an added importance. In this second case study we have seen how distinctive images drawn selectively from the repertoire of mega- lithic art were deployed in an entirely new medium and how the pottery bearing this distinctive decoration seems to have been associated with special types of ar- chaeological site and treated in special ways. It is per- haps no surprise that the limited repertoire of motifs shared by Irish megalithic art and Grooved Ware should include some of the entoptic signs discussed by Lewis- Williams and Dowson (fig. 3, I, IV-VI). Pottery of this type has often seemed to possess a particular signifi-</page><page sequence="8">Volume 30, Number i, February I989 I 75 cance, but this observation provides the first indication of why. Neither the Breton evidence nor that from Brit- ain and Ireland can prove the case they put forward, but the ideas they discuss have certainly helped to shed light on some of the more intractable problems experienced by those working in an entirely different field. That makes their study a particularly persuasive one. References Cited BENDER, B. I985.
