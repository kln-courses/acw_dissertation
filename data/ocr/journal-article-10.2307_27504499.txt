<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE R. KRUPP and BERNARD KLIGFELD The Bereavement Reaction a cross-cultural evaluation Introduction The closing scene in the drama of life is death. From the beginning of time, man has stood in awe of the inevitable end, the strange visitation that conquers every individual, stills every tongue, stops every action. To account for this alien phenomenon, man has, over the years, slowly advanced a number of hypotheses and developed patterns of behavior, rituals, and ceremonies to deal with the emotional problems arising from this final separation. It is upon these reactions to the loss of a loved one (or the bereavement reaction) in different regions of the world at dif ferent times, and especially in contemporary America, that this paper is centered, with emphasis on the symptomatology, pathology, and the significance of these reactions. The question arises, should not the reaction to bereavement have a universal pattern: grief, confusion, fear? Such, we know, is not the case. In one culture the sick or dying person may already be considered dead; in another, even after the disposal of the corpse the individual is still con sidered socially alive. A substitute may be appointed to act his role, or he may be considered to live on through another. Time plays a varying part, too. Among the Pueblo Indians, for example, bereavement is short and hurried, while in the Cocopa Indian tribe it may extend for years. With the Zu?i, a day or two after the funeral the statement is made that a year has passed. We find that there are analogous features in cultures quite remote from each other geographically; there are also remarkable dif ferences in cultures close to each other. In all societies, an individual life consists of passing successively from one status to another and from one role to another. The most significant changes are generally set off by ritual and ceremony. Birth, puberty, and death command their own responses, reactions, and experiences that are 222 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="2">not only important to the individual in the culture, but are also utilized by a society to express its important historical and cultural processes. Bereavement is similar to other crises in a given culture in that it expresses the values of that culture. It is different in that it brings with it separa tion and finality. It is understandable that death should have a social immediacy and finality far greater than have birth or puberty. Since the activities of a group are dependent upon social interaction, the dead one forces the group to recognize his new state of separation. This problem of separa tion and its dynamics are what make bereavement more than merely a facet of the values of a particular culture. The study of bereavement from a cross-cultural viewpoint is also valuable in that it can promote objectivity, once the attitudes and be havior of our own culture are clarified. In turn, this may aid us as individ uals to cope with the inevitable event that all of us must face. Fear, irra tional behavior, and mystery prevail in the area of dying, death, and bereavement. There is a widespread denial of death's inevitability and finality. Factors leading to the development of these irrational attitudes need to be examined and evaluated. This may aid us in our living with death and the dead. In what ways and toward what apparent end do different societies provide their own peculiar cultural practices for dealing with the prob lems of bereavement with which all are so concerned? How do factors of social role, economics, and family grouping affect these matters? What is the role, for example, of fears, hostility, ambivalence, and dreams, in bereavement processes? This paper seeks to indicate possible answers to these questions. The authors, neither of whom is an anthropologist, recognize their limitations in this ambitious project. However, over several years both have gathered considerable case material in their professional practice that has enabled them to illuminate material from other cultures. This is a pilot attempt rather than a finished work, written to prepare the way for further systematic study and to advance our understanding of our own and other cultures. It is helpful to define what we mean by the terms "bereavement" and "bereavement reaction," which are used in preference to "grief" and "mourning." Each of these latter terms is heavily saturated with cul tural assumptions, but "bereavement" can be defined with some preci The Bereavement Reaction 223</page><page sequence="3">sion; it is more difficult, however, to ascertain the amount of grief a person feels. "Bereavement"1 refers objectively to the appearance, be havior, attitudes, and feelings of someone who has recently been sepa rated by death from a loved one and is endeavoring to give him up. While not entirely excluding external appearance and behavior, the word "grief" refers chiefly to the inner emotions, attitudes, and thoughts of the mourner. "Mourning" refers more to the external rites, the cus toms, or conventions of bereavement, but it is usually used interchange ably with "bereavement." The contributions of psychoanalysis to the study of bereavement There has been no lack of anthropologists who have discussed many funeral rites and bereavement practices throughout the world; however, only a few [Tylor (53), Malinowski (40), Durkheim (19), Benedict (6) ] have made any effort to synthesize these. Some work on the subject has been done by sociologists [Eliot (20), Becker (4), and Waller (55)], and more recently Mandelbaum (41) and Volkart (54) have attempted to combine sociological and anthropological understanding in order to understand the effect of bereavement on the community. The study of depression as a pathology has thrown great light upon the normal mechanism of bereavement. From the literature concerning the dynamics of depression we learn the significance of the loss of object. (7, 21,26, 36) Breuer's and Freud's famous case of "Anna O." in 1880, (13) which marked the introduction of psychoanalysis, was actually a case of be reavement reaction. In his classic paper on "Mourning and Melancholia," Freud, attempting to clarify the dynamics of depression, elucidated the mechanism of bereavement. He directed attention to the structural simi larity between mourning and depression, then illustrated the differences. (26) The attitude of the mourner is that of clinging to the lost loved ob ject. The tie to the dead one is represented by many separate memories of the past. The process of the "work of mourning" was described by Freud as follows: "Reality passes its verdict?that the object no longer 2Eric Partridge in Origins (1959) derives bereavement from ctreven, to reave, akin to Old Frisian reva, to rob." Thus a bereaved person has literally been robbed of something. (45) 2 24 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="4">exists?upon each single one of the memories and hopes through which the libido was attached to the lost object, and the ego, confronted, as it were, over a decision whether it will share this fate, is persuaded, by the sum of its narcissistic satisfactions in being alive, to sever its attachment to the non-existent object." It is a painful and difficult task to carry out this work of mourning. Therefore, the bereaved person resists it, main taining the illusion that the lost one still lives. It was by pointing out that mourning is not just the reaction to the loss of a loved person, but the process of withdrawing interest from that person and transfering it to another, that Freud made a valuable contri bution. It is, therefore, interesting to speculate why, in some cultures, the transfer of interest is easily accomplished, while in others it is a most difficult task. [In this paper, Freud did not deal with the significance of an individual's relation to his mother in the mourning reaction. In his later "Problem of Anxiety" he did deal with it. (27) ] It was Abraham (1, 2) who introduced the concept of a primal de pression that developed in early childhood through disappointment in obtaining the mother's love. He demonstrated its relation to bereave ment. Melanie Klein agreed with Abraham and Freud that in both nor mal and abnormal mourning there is a reactivation of an infantile depres sive state. She relates this to the breast, which, being mourned, represents in the infant's mind love, security, goodness. The depressed person and the pathological bereaved person have never overcome the infantile de pressive position. They have become unable to establish good object re lationships or to feel secure within. "The person who gradually and suc cessfully masters his grief does so through reinstating within himself his lost object as something that is good." (34) Lindemann was the first to study extensively the symptomatology and management of bereavement reactions. He had firsthand information on the reactions of the survivors and relatives of 101 victims of the Coco nut Grove fire. He formulated the following pathognomonic signs for the bereavement reaction: somatic distress symptoms, such as sighing respirations, weakness, and anorexia; sensorium generally somewhat al tered and preoccupation with image of the deceased; feelings of guilt; lack of warmth, irritability toward people; loss of normal pattern of con duct with change in daily routine. Interestingly, Lindemann implies that there is little relation between an individual's previous neurosis and his bereavement reaction. (37) The Bereavement Reaction n^</page><page sequence="5">Spitz (50, 51) has recorded firsthand observations on severe grief reactions in infancy. Bowlby (8, 9, 10, 11) has contributed the most to our understanding of the dynamic process in bereavement. He has written extensively on separation anxiety, grief in infancy, mourning in animals, and special problems of mourning. He suggests that the child's tie to the mother is best conceived as an outcome of a number of instinctual response systems, mostly nonoral in character. These are part of the inherited behavior repertoire of man. Comparing bereavement in infants, adults, and an imals, he offers evidence of an almost identical set and sequence of responses. After the initial stage of protest and demand, despair and dis organization set in, to be followed by a stage of reorganization. Bowlby correlates the bereavement process with the modern biologi cal theory of adaptation. He points out that the instinctive response sys tems in bereavement are still focused on the original object, with angry efforts to recover it. Successful resolution occurs only when there is a reorganization. Pathological bereavement is a fixation in the first phase of the bereavement process, and the individual, often unconsciously, is still striving to recover the lost object. Bereavement in American culture Perhaps the best way to begin a cross-cultural examination is to study the bereavement reaction patterns that are closest to us. Much in our American culture conspires to remove death from our minds and even our feelings. In television, the movies, and other expres sions of our mores, emphasis is on the preservation of youth and the denial of aging. Death, though threatening and difficult to handle, is made remote. Social security and the proliferation of nursing homes have facilitated the removal of many elderly and severely sick persons from the family circle. Estranged by our civilization from the basic realities of life (of which death is a part), we have lost contact with the daily strug gle for life of animals in field and forest. We have less and less contact with nature, with the death of livestock, and with the slaughtering of animals for food. Death has become for us foreboding, frightening, re pugnant, and mysterious. The bereaved person is expected to control his emotions and make his state "less noticeable." The funeral "parlor," the banks of flowers heaped around the coffin, the make-up used on the deceased, the music, 226 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="6">and even the words spoken by many ministers tend to deny death and the possibility that it is happening to ourselves and our loved ones. Friends look at the corpse and describe it as "so lifelike." The reaction to bereavement does not produce the emotional outbursts, such as the tearing of the clothes and hair, so common to the ancients and to pre literate societies.2 Indeed, the emphasis is quite opposite: self-control is rewarded. What effect does this suppression have on the usually close-knit American family unit, in which parent and sibling substitutes are neither readily available nor psychologically acceptable? Bereavement often de velops into a severe family crisis as well as an individual one. The family interaction is broken up, and feelings of anxiety and un certainty possess its members, as fruitless attempts are made to restore the previous equilibrum. So we are caught in conflict. Those dear to us have become fewer and closer, yet opportunities to express intense emotion are less available. This often leads to irrational behavior. When death does occur, the deceased is overpraised, and at times consideration for the dead is greater than consideration for the living. The lost object is overidealized, as is the un obtainable love object in romantic love.3 Our cultural emphasis on the individual in bereavement is evidenced in the deritualization of mourning. Aside from the rites of funeral chapel or church or synagogue and the retention of some old-world forms of communal involvement in a family's loss (e.g., the Catholic wake and the Jewish Shiva period), the individual is largely left to fend for him self in adjusting to all changes in status and role. Problems of the bereaved in all cultures Problems concerning death, its denial, the life hereafter, disposing of the corpse, and fear of the dead, produce reactions that have to be dealt with in all cultures. Death is of great importance for man; but how death is regarded, the values, explanations, beliefs, fears concerning it, and the ways of managing the reactions to death depend to a large extent on the norms of one's particular culture. 2 These practices are common, even now, among some groups that have main tained ethnic identity within the wider American culture; e.g., Italians, Orthodox Jews, Puerto Ricans, etc. 8 For examples of irrational behavior at funerals, see Bowman (12) and Hocart (so The Bereavement Reaction 227</page><page sequence="7">Problem i. How death is explained. Despite the fact that death is seen as the ultimate fate of every man, explanations of its occurrence are sought not in inevitable natural causes, but rather in someone's mistake, an oversight, or some sorcery. It must be remembered that in a majority of simpler societies, death comes abruptly to many. More people die in childhood, youth, and the prime of life than in old age; in fact, few ever live to old age. Death, therefore, is more often associated with youth than with age. Simmons (48), in reviewing 47 tribes, found only 4 in which death was frankly recognized as a natural occurrence. In 17, death was not regarded as natural; in 26 others the possibility was only partially admitted. Countless legends have developed to explain the origin of death. In them we find many accounts of death occurring as an accident or blunder. Frazer tells of the legend of the Bank Island natives concern ing the origin of old age. Once, people never died. They renewed their youth by casting off their skins like snakes and crabs. One day, however, an old lady went to the stream to renew herself. She threw away her old skin, which floated downstream and was caught on a stick. When she later came home, her child did not recognize her and put up such a fuss that she retrieved her old skin. From that day on, people stopped casting off their old skins and renewing their youth. (22, p.70)4 Furthermore, it was a widespread and persistent conviction that something could be done to prevent aging and prolong life. Some tribes confidently sought longer life through prayer and the careful observ ance of ritual and divine precepts. Others have felt that longevity is an appropriate reward for those who have lived good, moral lives. The 4 Other explanations of death: (a) the Aranda cannot conceive of death from natural causes. To him, it is always due to the magical operations of an enemy. (43, p. 41) (b) Even death at the age of 100 would be evidence of magic to the Aroucanians. (48) (c) The Semang attribute death, disease, and most of the ills of life to black magic or the malevolence of supernatural beings. Dis ease to them is caused by an evil spirit who has gained entrance into the body. (43, p. 100) (d) The ancient Hebrew made reference to a "Tree of Life" planted in the Garden of Eden. Adam, the primeval man, came into possession of a life giving plant that had the power to renew youth, but he lost it through the wiles of a serpent. (48, p. 219) (Gen. 2:9) (e) Among the Hopi, there is the belief that for every sickness there is a cure; therefore, death following illness is attrib uted to the lack of strength or will of the individual rather than to a defective remedy. (33) 2 28 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="8">ancient Hebrews promised a long life as a result of obeying the com mandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land." (48) The Hopi asserted that "whoever is not mean, will live long" and "a worried life is a short one." (48) Another powerful remedy has been the possession of a charm or potion. A Kwakiutl facing old age might bathe his face in urine and dip himself in salt water. In the Book of Kings, we read how a fair maiden was sought to warm the bones of King David when he became very old. (32) From the above, with Simmons, we may draw three conclusions: ( 1 ) People have frequently denied the inevitability of death as a natural event and have put forth all kinds of explanations to make death a result of some act, i.e., to find a villain. (2) Many people believe that some thing can be done to forestall old age or at least prolong life. (3) It is a common belief that although death can destroy the body, no serious damage can be done to the spirit or ghost. It isn't really death. In fact, death is really a service, since the spirit may now be free of the body to go to eternal happiness in some distant land.5 problem 2. Fear of the cause of death, the corpse, and the ghost and its relation to hostility and attempts to recover the lost one. In explaining the cause of death by outside forces, people have usu ally blamed spirits, magic, or witchcraft. Note the statement of Freud apropos of our own Western culture: "Our unconscious does not be lieve in its own death; everyone is convinced of his own immortality." (25) The earliest burials were probably a crude attempt to protect the living from the spirits of the deceased as well as of those that caused the death. Were it not for burial, the spirits would harm the family and bring pestilence to the land. (29) The first authentic records of earth burial date back to the latter part of the Paleolithic period (350,000-30,000 B.C.) and show a num ber of skulls buried in group with stone weapons, trinkets, etc. The Neo 5 Tylor has pointed out how instructive it is to notice the words that have been found suitable to express the concept of spirit. "The ghost or phantasm seen by the dreamer or the visionary is an unsubstantial form, like a shadow, and thus the familiar term of the shade comes in to express the soul. Thus the Tasmanian word for the shadow is also that for the spirit. The Algonquin Indians describe a man's soul as otahchick, his shadow. . . . The Abipines made the one word loakal serve for 'shadow, soul, echo, image'." (53) The Bereavement Reaction ng</page><page sequence="9">lithic period (30,000-6,000 B.C.) points to a greater concern for proper care of the dead, as shown by their great burial caverns and barrows, marked by megaliths and huge stone crosses. Here too, the dead were buried with some of their possessions. (35) The attitude toward the corpse, in many cultures, tends to be one of horror and disgust. "Among the Maori, anyone who had touched a corpse or who had taken part in its interment became extremely unclean and was almost cut off from intercourse with his fellow beings" for a period. (24) Among the Trobriands, however, the corpse is usually the focus of pious attention. Often the body is stroked and fondled or em braced, although these acts may be considered dangerous and repug nant. They may represent a longing for all that remains of the dead person. (40) Fear of the dead one is another universal emotion in all cultures, though somewhat disguised in present-day practices. In fact, many societies have taboos against pronouncing the name of the deceased. (22) The bereaved may attempt to placate the deceased by speaking only well of him. At the same time, however, he is feared and rituals are performed to prevent his return. "The pious rituals of holding vigils at the side of the bier and of throwing sand into the grave or of erect ing monuments of stone are traceable to archaic measures which are intended to prevent the dead from coming back." (21) It is surprising to note how tribes separated by vast oceans, living in different continents under vastly unlike conditions have similar meth ods for combating the evil spirits that cause death.6 6 Such as: (a) The body is burned in order to destroy the evil spirits. Some African tribes (Zulus) burn the house and the personal belongings of the deceased to prevent the evil spirits from hovering in the vicinity. (35) (b) The body is covered with stones to prevent the evil spirits that caused the death from return ing to harm the survivors. The heap of stones also serves as a warning for pass ersby to turn aside. Sometimes it is the custom to inscribe the name of the de ceased on one of the stones. The stones not only prevent the lingering of the spirits that caused the death, but also make sure that the dead one does not return, (ibid.) (c) Many tribes smear their bodies with tar (Navaho) or other substances that they believe are impermeable to the evil spirits escaping from the dead body. The Congo Kaffir roasts a species of nut-oil into a paste and smears his body with it. (ibid.) (?) Among some primitive tribes a circle of fire is lit around the dead body to singe the wings of the evil spirits and to prevent them from hurting others. Other tribes throw spears and arrows into the ear of the deceased to kill the hovering spirits. (Perhaps the military custom of firing a salute over the grave of a dead soldier may have its origin in protecting the living from evil spirits.) (ibid.) (e) Among many peoples there exists the belief that 230 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="10">Often these fears and superstitions proved beneficial. Under their in fluence, primitive man took precautions for health and sanitation with out being aware that he was doing so. Before Freud, anthropologists explained the fear of the ghost by re lating it to the fear of death. Most primitive societies believed that death came only through being slain, whether by violence or by magic, and therefore the slain person would be angry. However, the application of the concept of ambivalence permits the assumption that projection mech anisms function in primitive societies as well as in our own. Whence does the ambivalence come? Is it only the culmination of the various everyday grievances and guilt that all people feel toward their loved ones? Bowlby (10, n) pointed out that in animals and hu mans, anger and weeping are part of the biological adaptive mechanisms utilized in attempting to recover the separated love object. The anger is directed at any one in the environment, including the mourner him self, or toward the dead one. The object of the anger is held responsible for the death (desertion) or for impeding the reunion. (The unconscious fantasy may be: if some culprit did it, the act can then be undone.) Anger during bereavement will then be found in all cultures.7 Each culture copes with this anger and its inevitable expression in accord with its own basic personality structure. The Hopi, of the Pueblo South those who touch the corpse are contaminated for a certain period. Thus Orthodox Jews still follow an ancient custom of washing the hands when leaving a ceme tery. The bereaved family, on returning home from the interment, pour water over their hands before re-entering their home, (f) According to Frazer (22, 23) mourning costumes were originally disguises. The mourners, fearing the return of spirits, wore strange clothing or painted their bodies. Black, brilliant red, and chalk-white (Orient) were favorite colors. We are so accustomed to regarding black as the proper color for mourning that the use of bright colors elsewhere may at first appear outlandish to us. 7 Expressions of hostility are seen in preliterate society. Self-inflicted wounds and actual and symbolic eating of the dead are common. In some societies, the funeral customs express "strong sanctions against violence." (49, 18) In others, quarrels are provoked, combats are organized, tortures are self-inflicted. (19, p. 395) Among the Euahlayi of Australia, since death is attributed to sorcery, the corpse may be asked for the murderer. One name after another is uttered until it seems to those around it that the body knocks. (38, p. 318) Among the Negritos, there are changes in emotions. "Love turned to sorrow, and sorrow became fear. With the closing of the grave, fear turned to hatred. The living and protective father was gone and a negative, destructive father had taken his place in their minds. He symbolized the fearful unknown, and his survivors would have to step carefully to avoid his wrath. They threw rocks at the grave, and threatened to harm the ghost if it should come next to them." (52) The Bereavement Reaction 2 31</page><page sequence="11">west, for example, are an essentially realistic people. They effectively discourage the violent expressions of emotions in jealousy, rivalry, be reavement, and other situations that in other cultures might call forth intense painful or hostile response. The Hopi in general have a healthy attitude toward life and death. (5, 6) They strongly believe in the strength of will and its importance in attaining health, long life, and happiness. (33) Whereas in some cultures, all life crises are treated as terror situations, the Hopi do not use terror in any of these?birth, puberty, marriage, death. Hopi funeral rites are the simplest and least dramatic of all their rituals. Despite their generally efficient control in every day living, cherishing the middle way, they regard death with fear and abhorrence. The funeral ceremony is a small, private affair in which weeping is dis couraged and memories repressed. The deceased is forgotten and life continues as usual. (42) This suppression must take place at the expense of their general Apollonian equilibrium. The Hopis believe that the bereaved spouse is in great danger of being pulled to join the dead one, especially if he grieves excessively. Therefore, he is isolated from ordi nary life for four days; he can neither speak nor be spoken to. For a year, he may be in danger from the dead, who will be jealous if he approaches a woman. Among the Hopi, there is an absence of the self-inflicted injuries so common to other tribes. Instead, there appears a great deal of conscious anger toward the dead one. It is felt that many people will their own death. Such a person is called a q?visa. He is sensitive, quick to take offence. When he is offended, he wills to die, so that the relative who hurt him will be bereft. One woman slapped the face of a corpse in her anger and cried, "You are mean to me to do this to me." (33) On a cere monial day, a woman died. The community reaction was anger. They felt she could have died the day before and that she had deliberately chosen that day to spoil the dance, (ibid.) Ruth Benedict (5, 6) has contrasted the mourning rites of the Pue blos with those of the Kwakiutls of Vancouver and the Dobus of Mela nesia. The Kwakiutls are in personality practically a direct opposite of the Pueblos, with a Dionysian preference for individual rivalry and showing of violence. They deal with mourning in ways similar to ways in which they deal with jealousy, rivalry, or marriage. In this society, when a person has killed another he does not need salvation; in fact, he 232 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="12">is a victor?the most envied of all victors. Suicide is seen as positive? a violent gesture of flinging away one's life. If the death of a relative occurs, it arouses a kind of cultural paranoia, in which those who were shamed must arouse themselves to get even. The Dobus are secretive, dour, prudish, and treacherous. They seem deeply afraid of nature and their neighbors. They see life as an expres sion of personal conflict with a harsh environment. The mourning prac tices among them are primarily "punishments inflicted by the blood kin upon the spouse for having caused the death of one of their number. That is, the mourning institutions are again one of numberless occasions which Dobu interprets as treachery and handles by selecting a victim whom it may punish." (6) This is certainly in contrast to the Pueblos, who treat the loss as an important emergency toward which society unites to minimize discomfort. In American society, in which the expression of hostility is more in dividual than institutionalized, the mourner at first has little contact with the outside world, except with whatever is connected with his depend ency needs. He may be irritable, impatient, even openly hostile or exces sively formal as he shows or hides his real feelings. If the bereaved does become aware of what goes on around him, the comparative lack of loss on others' part may seem intolerable. The presence of friends and the call of duties, however, force him back to reality, even as he struggles to recapture the image of the dead one. Self-defeating acts, such as impoverishing himself or alienating peo ple, may be a pathological expression of his need to control his feelings and expiate guilt. Regardless of the culture examined, hostility in bereavement is found. However, each culture copes with this anger in accord with its basic personality structure, its institutions,8 and its established patterns of deal ing with other life crises. problem 3. The desire for continued interaction with the lost one; how this merges into the quest for immortality; the role of dreams in this process. We have already seen in our own culture an individual's unwilling ness to give up a loved object and the attempts made to recover the lost 8 See Kardiner, Abram, The Psychological Frontiers of Society. New York, Columbia University Press, 1945. The Bereavement Reaction 233</page><page sequence="13">object.9 Feeling frustrated and empty, he attempts to restore the previ ous balance by utilizing denial and rationalization. Primitive man, too, attempts to retrieve the lost object, using the same defense mechanisms. He sees death as a change in the manner of communication between individuals (e.g., magic, ritual, worship), rather than as a true separation. In addition, he has to explain the difference between the living and the dead and the presence of the loved ones in dreams and visions. We shall here discuss four elements of this problem, each of which represents an attempt to regain the lost loved object. a. Belief in the ghost or spirit. In preliterate societies, the general be lief is that after death, the spirits or ghosts are set free to linger near the body, to wander on earth, or flit about in the air, or to travel to proper regions, where usually a happy existence awaits them.10 Death, then, can be regarded as a boon, since the soul can now really be free to live in bodiless form. Or perhaps the ghost may return to mortal life by reincarnation or undergo a transmigration and become another living creature.11 Since the ghost leads an untrammeled existence, death can represent an instrument for enhancing personal position and 9 See Freud's categorical statement: "Man never willingly abandons a libido position." (26) 10 Among the Todas of India, the dead lead a life much like that on earth. "They tend their buffalo and crops, free, however, from rats and other destructive animals." (43, p. 126) Among the Wahgi of New Guinea, the worship of the dead is considered the very heart and soul of their religion. (39) The "shadowy image" is an im material other-self with identical appearance, physical and mental abilities, likes and dislikes, inclinations, weaknesses and needs, and the same character as the person had in life. One of the chief duties of the relatives of the dying person is to attempt to confine the soul to the body by firmly holding the head (the avenue through which the soul enters and departs). The Semang of the Malay Peninsula believe that "the ghosts of the departed inhabit a spirit world on an island in the western sea.... Men grow old and young again, and never have to die." (48) Among the Iroquois, "the ghost quits the grave and journeys to a spirit land in the west, where game is fat and plentiful." (43, p. 313) Among the Witotos, "after death the soul lingers near the house until burial has taken place, and then journeys to a spirit in the sky. Life there is an idealized reflection of that on earth; game is always plentiful and the women beautiful and amenable." (ibid., p. 469) Among the Wahgi of New Guinea, the soul wanders about for a few weeks until the "cause" of the death is discovered by the living. The burial grounds are the actual abode of disembodied souls. There the souls carry on ordinary lives, eat, sleep, walk around, work in gardens, raise pigs, get married. They are happy, sometimes sad, moody, helpful to the living, and often vengeful. (39, p. 84) 11 According to Simmons, on a statistical basis survival of the ghosts has been far more common than theories of reincarnation or transmigration. In 71 tribes studied, belief in reincarnation was found to be strong in 6; moderate in 5; 2 34 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="14">power. Accompanying this is the belief that the spirit requires special deference, even sacrifice, from the mortal survivors. Since death, not the end of everything, is often seen as an improvement, it is no wonder that its visitation can sometimes be accepted as a more welcome situation.12 This belief in the spirit living on does not limit itself to humans, but includes animals.13 In our cases, we have often asked a bereaved person to respond to the question, "Do you find there are ideas and thoughts that are helpful to you in this situation?" A typical response is: "It is helpful to think she is with her father and at peace. I am relieved she is free of pain." Mourners often report that they feel the presence of the deceased in some inchoate form. Others who deny the belief in spirits or ghosts of any kind nevertheless act as though their own behavior is still of con sequence to the deceased. In many cultures, along with the idea that the spirit of the individual will live on is the idea that the manner of death influences the type of existence in the hereafter. In fact, certain societies utilize the event as an opportunity to increase one's personal gain. Certain means of dying are considered more honorable and bring greater prestige. In some societies, the manner of dying can be considered more important than the fact of the death. For example, where warfare is an essential part of a society's existence, death in combat involves less fear than dying by other means. Certain cultures have prescribed for the aged the exact method of dying by which future respect and deference will be obtained. (20, p. 204) b. Need to facilitate the passage of the spirit to the future abode and to make the future life more comfortable. The more important the dead person, the more is done to provide the equipment that will enable the departed to continue life in the next world on the same basis as in this world. It is considered natural that food, clothing, and weapons accom pany him. We are familiar with the suttee in India, which calls for the sacrifice of the widow. In many cultures, until recently the death of a royal personage required that not only wives but a considerable number of servants also be interred. Among the Chaldeans and Babylonians, a dead king was prepared for post-mortem royalty by burying servants, slaves, and cattle with him. slight in 4; absent in 2; and unreported in 54. Transmigration beliefs were rarer, but belief in and fear of ghosts were reported marked in 49 tribes and absent in 9. (48) 12 Contemporary religions offer this promise, too. 13 See Tylor (53). The Bereavement Reaction 235</page><page sequence="15">(29) A similar practice was observed by certain Egyptian kings and queens, but carried to the extreme by burying entire courts. Courtiers of the highest rank are there, and the arrangements indicate voluntary entrance into the crypt. (16, p. 409) Since animals, too, lived on, not only wives and servants were sacrificed to live with the dead man's spirit, but also pets and livestock. In some of our cases, it often became important to the mourners to dress the corpse in the most beautiful garment or in a rituaily acceptable shroud that somehow would be of importance in the future of the de ceased. Sometimes cards are buried with a habitual card player and jocu lar remarks are made about friends being buried close together so that games may be played. Elaborate precautions are often taken to preserve the corpse from disintegration, as if some element of life still remains. c. Need to believe that after death one joins one's ancestors, that interaction continues. Most primitive societies see death as joining one's ancestors. Like the beloved object in romantic love, or the idealized parent image of the child, the ancestors become great and powerful men and women of outstanding virtue and achievements. They are not dis integrated corpses lying supine and powerless. They have attributes of omnipotence and omniscience. They may be dependent on live ones for food or sacrifices, but if these be not forthcoming, the living can be made to wish they had been more dutiful. Among the Hopi, the ghosts of the dead become metamorphosed into kachinas, or ancestral spirits of their respective clans. Each year the kachinas return to earth for about six months. The kachina does not represent an individual ancestor, but an anthropomorphic totemic pro genitor of the clan. At the same time, the clan also worships zoomorphic totemic heroes. (43, p. 346) Among the ancient Hebrews, death itself was truly a mere passing from one's own earthly family of living descendants to one's ancestral family. Thus death was really a rebirth, a re-entry into a new existence, contemplation of which would bring comfort in the midst of life's trials and tribulations. It meant that the spirit now would not be lonely, but would be reunited with its family. It meant a continuation instead of a cessation, the surety of existence instead of the dread of annihilation. Death then does not disrupt the cohesion in the patriarchal family for more than a fleeting moment. The two features of the ideal end?to reach a ripe old age and to be reunited in death with one's fathers?can be traced throughout biblical history. (44, p. 236) 236 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="16">Among the Wahgi, the relatives worshiped are the deceased con sanguineous kin of the father. The mother's dead are completely disre garded. The wife is obliged to honor her husband's ancestors, not her own, and after death her soul goes to the abode of the ancestors of her husband. The immediate patrilineal relatives are responsible more often than not for accidents, disease, and death, and they seem to be much more demanding than the remote ancestors. They are more vengeful, consequently they must be appeased and catered to more frequently and with greater diligence. The closer the relationship, the deeper is the religious dependence and fear. In reviewing ancestor concepts, we see that regardless of form? individual ancestor, ancestors coalesced into a new entity (e.g., kachi nas, or totem), or the immortal family?each represents a way of either joining or reuniting with the lost loved one, or permits the belief that the loss has not really occurred?only the means of communication has changed. d. The role of dreams. It seems that in all cultures, dreams about the dead have a special significance, sometimes as an augury, often as a proof that the dead do return. However, psychoanalytically the bereavement dream represents the wish for reunion and at the same time is an indi cator of the degree of resolution of the painful affect. Bereavement dreams may vary greatly in mood and theme as the dreamer attempts to solve the separation. As already discussed, bereavement has beginning (protest), middle (disorganization), and termination (resolution) phases. Although the dream is primarily part of the first stage of protest and denial, it is present in all stages. It changes in content and affect as the work of mourning progresses. The bereaved whose previous relationship is characterized by con siderable ambivalence will, we know from our study in our own culture, tend to have dreams filled with hostility, fear, and terror. As Freud pointed out, in the unconscious mind, even a natural death is perceived as murder, the person being killed by evil wishes, and the dreamer, the child, and the savage all share the same attitude towards the dead. (24) Stewart (52) writes that among the Negritos of the Philippines, the dreams actively aid in the reorganization of the bereaved personality. "Whenever someone died, his children dreamed of him repeatedly until the funeral feast.... The dream was expected, and did not arouse fear or depression. Providing the children were willing to do what the image The Bereavement Reaction 237</page><page sequence="17">of the deceased parent requested, this type of dream aroused no sense of guilt." It appears from our study, though it needs further verification from other cultures, that the bereaved who has had a previous successful rela tionship will tend to have happy dreams in which he is reunited with the loved one. As in the conscious working-through process, the dreams may recall any of numerous incidents that bring back memories of the previous good relationship. Thus we see the dream as another means of continuing interaction with the lost one. problem 4. Impact of the death on the community structure, and how the cormrnmity uses ritual to deal with the loss. When a person dies in a simple society, the impact is felt not only by those close to him, e.g., his family, but unlike what happens in our own society, the life of the entire community is severely disturbed. The event interrupts the normal course of life and shakes the moral foundations of society. Death in primitive society may, then, be much more than loss of a member; it may threaten the cohesion and solidarity of the group. The loss of an individual member of the society is felt by the society as a whole, variously, as an occasion for realignment of status and role positions, an economic loss, a crisis that requires special measures to pre vent massive evil from befalling the society, and an opportunity to re new adherence to the implied or explicit ideology of the society. In this connection, the function of the funeral rite is to enable the community to force the survivor back into social interaction with the living as well as to maintain the integrity of the community. We have already discussed how the desire for continued interaction with the dead carries with it the implication of danger from, and fear of, the ghost. Not only must a society protect itself from the evil machina tions of the ghost and force it away, but it must enforce its own values and social relationships in facing the loss of a member. Often the mourn ing rituals proceed in well-rehearsed stages involving the entire com munity in the ostensible activity of comforting the mourners and bury ing the dead. In these actions, however, are imbedded the realignments and reaffirmations of role and status that are necessary for the continued function of the society. From the point of view of the group, the loss of a member derives special meaning, depending upon whether he was a child, an active adult, or an aged adult who retired from participation in the feeding 238 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="18">and defense activities of those in the prime of life. Thus, for example, in some tribes the corpse of a dead warrior is honored with tremendous taboos, since the aura of spirit force surrounding it could do damage. Therefore, this corpse must be buried in a special way in a special place. The body of a child, in contrast, may be buried within the hut or just outside it. The Andamans, (14) the Kotas, and the Hebrideans, each in a dif ferent way, have developed patterns of mourning behavior that strengthen the feeling of community: in the first group, through dance and singing; in the second, through encouraging the participation of the young in the "Dry Funeral" permitting sexual license; and in the third, through the wake and attendant customs. (41, 42) Let us see how this is done among the Roman Catholic people of Barra, the southern island group in Scotland's outer Hebrides, Here public mourning is practiced with burial rites occurring in five stages. The close relatives are involved in the first, and the total community in the last. "When the final bell tolls, every islander participates," (41) e.g., helps to bear the coffin. This division into five stages and the com munity atmosphere of acceptance and participation have helped the people of Barra to develop a smooth and easy set of patterns for coping with the event of death. "There appears, at least overtly, to be no great fear of the dead, no anxiety about speeding the departed spirit, and no avoidance of the topic or of the memory of the deceased." (41) They have developed a successful means of dealing with bereavement by creating an atmosphere of community acceptance and participation. We may now examine the impact of the loss on the social position of the bereaved. The terms orphan, widow, widower refer to the special status into which a bereaved person enters, especially if the relation to the deceased was clearly defined. Thus a woman who loses her husband may gain or, more often, lose economic status. Her position is often anomalous, and the society in which she lives must provide more or less clearly defined formulae for dealing with that anomaly. Among Ortho dox Jews, even today, levirate marriage must be legally abjured before a childless widow is permitted to marry anyone but her deceased hus band's next of kin. Among the Kota, the widow is given a year in which she is reoriented into her society. From the "Green Funeral" (which takes place soon after death) to the "Dry Funeral" (a communal event that takes place a year later), the deceased continues to have the attributes of social personality. The Bereavement Reaction 239</page><page sequence="19">A widow is still her late husband's wife during this period. Biologic paternity is not as important as sociological paternity. If the widow becomes pregnant before the second funeral, the child shares the de ceased husband's name, clan, and property. The important status to be protected is that of the child (who is to inherit the patrimony) rather than that of the widow. Indeed, Mandelbaum reports that "the faithful widow of a man who has died without a son will conscientiously try to become pregnant before the end of his 'Dry Funeral.' " (41, 42) The ceremonial roles of the Kota "Dry Funeral" are well defined and function to proclaim the established social relationships in the society. Thus there are those polluted by contact with the corpse, who must be purified and restored to society. The kinsmen and others help restore the bereaved to normal behavior. Widows and widowers must observe stringent taboos. Siblings, children of a dead person, also have important roles to play in the "Dry Funeral." Parents, however, have no formal part to play in the funeral, regardless of how grief stricken they may be. Part of the ceremony involves dancing as a distraction and to "show both the viability and concern of society." Toward the end, widows and widowers perform rituals in several stages that bring them progres sively closer to normal social life. The step back to normal relations takes place at night, after the second cremation, when widows and widowers have sexual relations, preferably with a sibling of the dead spouse. After two more days of anging and dancing, the village takes up the ordi nary round of life again. Thus, while a period of grief is provided for, sorrow tends to be curtailed by ceremonies. Another example is found among the Cocopa of the Southwest, who some time after the cremation perform another mourning ceremony. While the cremation ritual helps the bereaved over the initial shock, the later mourning ceremony focuses more on r?int?gration of the bereaved into the religious and social system. Among the Hopi, as we have already discussed, it is expected that the bereaved, regardless of their feelings, will not overtly express grief. There is no formal public wailing. As soon as possible, the corpse is buried and persons polluted by contact with the dead are purified. It is expected that the deceased will be forgotten quickly, and the mourners will continue with life as usual. Overt attention is focused on dismissing the dead, which is the tribe's way of restoring the bereaved to a normal place in society. Sometimes the funeral ceremony, instead of reintegrating, serves to 240 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="20">highlight a lack of solidarity in the community. The mourners may then be hampered in their restoration to normal social activity. On the other hand, the deritualization of American culture tends to throw the mourner upon his own resources, and there is little help in finding a comfortable social status. Thus we often see persons who have been widowed at an early age remain social isolates for the rest of their lives. For all societies, death remains a social problem as well as an individual one. Discussion In reviewing the subject of death and bereavement, we have found the problems neither simple nor uniform. The attitudes toward death are extremely variable. To the individual, the meaning of dying ranges from the culmination of honor to shame and dishonor. "The dying may be feared or loved, despised or honored, reviled or even worshiped, and he, in turn, might deny death as a natural necessity, resist it as a curse, sub mit to it as the hand of fate, embrace it as a golden opportunity, or even demand it as a right." (48) The man who has just died produces a social change far more signifi cant than those attending birth, puberty, or marriage. This does not mean that he is completely gone. He lives on, both in the myriad of memories in those close to him and as an integral item of the super natural. Every religious system grants a certain amount of power, om nipotence, and omniscience to the dead. This raises two important issues: What is the significance of the funeral ritual? Why is it that to the dead are imparted future life, power, and interest in the living? The funeral ritual serves the function of preventing individual, family, and group disorganization from spreading. In any society, when a person dies there is a personal, a family, and community loss. "All the daily expectations of action, sentiment, and thought are frustrated, and the emotional props based on the lost one are gone." (28) The remaining one strives to bring back the lost one and restore the previous balance. At the moment of greatest sorrow, the mor tuary ritual forces those most concerned to participate in community activity and to adjust to the reality of the death. Community r?int?gra tion occurs. Much of the time may be occupied with feasting, exchange of goods, and prescribed forms of conduct for the bereaved. In addition, these rites often insure the soul's safe passage and preservation in the hereafter. The Bereavement Reaction 241</page><page sequence="21">The ritual also drives away malevolent spirits and ghosts, while set ting up barriers against the unwished-for return of the dead. The funeral thus provides a channel for emotions; stresses the value of the social role played by the deceased in life; forces recognition of new relationships with the deceased; and reintegrates the group. All of this aids in coping with the loss. Let us go back to the question, why are the dead invested with future life and power? What is the connection between the dead and the spiritual forces? We notice that the preservation of the belief in immor tality provides certain advantage to the individual, family, and commu nity. Essentially it permits the denial of the loved object being perma nently lost and thus allows for the phantasy of eventual reunion. The anthropomorphic characteristics of both the gods and departed spirits are readily noticed: both the gods and spirits of the dead maintain their interest in the traditional moral structure of the group in that they both direct the moral actions of the living. Although the forces may be bad at times, for the most part their role is to aid the individual and society to obtain food and to insure fertility. The dead become overidealized and are the personnel of the sacred myths, legends, and beliefs. By recogniz ing the role of the dead and their place in religion, we are able to see once more the projection of the parent-child relationship. Therefore, religious funeral rituals permit the individual to keep his parent or sub stitute from permanently leaving him. This facility in maintaining the relationship with the deceased fits in with the seeming lack of emphasis on the uniqueness and importance of the individual in some primitive societies. There is little choice and little range for identification, and within this narrow range, there is a broader relationship with more people along with a relative ab sence of self-awareness. Among the Ifaluk people, for example, (54) the bereaved show pain and distress, but as soon as the funeral is over they laugh and smile as if there had been no loss at all. Strong indi vidual family attachments are rare among them, and their identifications are multiple rather than exclusive. Feelings of love, ambivalence, identifi cation, and dependence14 appear to be relatively weak concerning any particular person. Many persons can play the significant family roles. 14 According to Powdermaker's hypothesis (46) the independence achieved, however, is not that of a mature self-identity. There seems to be greater prepon derance of imitation mechanisms present rather than of true internalization, which leads to autonomous self-identity. See Axelrad and Maury (3) and Hilgard, Newman, and Fisk (30). 242 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="22">Thus grief is general and prescribed; lacking specificity, it is soon over and done with. In our society, on the other hand, intimacy of relation ship to fewer people makes bereavement personally significant and therefore anxiety-producing. In conclusion, as we view man anthropologically, we see that the race deals with death and the dead in ways that are not only reminiscent of but seem also to parallel the stages of "the work of mourning" that Freud described as the severance of attachment to the non-existent ob ject and transfer of interest to the living. Bowlby, from a biological standpoint, refined Freud's stages into: protest, disorganization, and finally reorganization. So also we find similar stages in the ways that different cultures deal with this phenomenon: there is concern over the cause of death, as though to find the cause were to enable the culture to blame a scapegoat for the unhappy event and at the same time to recap ture the lost object, thus undoing the evil. The development of the idea of spirit may also be seen as "protest." A society could thus admit that a person had died, while at the same time treating him as though he were still alive and functioning in the community. This also permits the feeling that the community is still intact. In the attitude of the community, the same ambivalence that is expressed toward living persons is expressed toward spirits of the dead. Fear and hostility are sometimes expressed by self-inflicted injuries? the fear representing hostility projected outward, and the injuries repre senting hostility turned inward. At the same time, the dead are looked upon benignly and overidealized. The final step that Freud described was the transfer of interest to new objects. We may understand it as the turning toward the concerns of the living, when the death and all its implications have finally been absorbed and integrated into the life processes of the bereaved. It appears that in society there develops a stage in which, as the full finality of the death event is recognized and accepted, the society becomes free to utilize the event constructively and to turn its energies more readily to the concerns of the living. This process operates in all cultures from the most primitive to our own. Summary Much is revealed about a bereaved individual and his culture by the manner in which he deals with death. The reactions to birth, puberty, and death are not special isolated examples of human behavior, but rather experiences that a society utilizes to express its important historical and The Bereavement Reaction 243</page><page sequence="23">cultural processes. Bereavement, unlike the other reactions, however, brings into play adaptive mechanisms that are utilized to recover the previous interaction: return of the lost loved one. Cross-cultural evaluation of mourning rituals indicates that an indi vidual's bereavement is conditioned not only by his early reaction to loss and biological adaptive mechanisms but also by the specific, institu tionalized ways provided by the culture for dealing with the loss. The problems in bereavement are universal: (i) How to explain death. (2) Fear of the cause of death, the corpse, the dead one?the role of hos tility and projection. (3) Desire for continued interaction with the lost one being transformed into a quest for immortality; the role of spirits, ancestors, and dreams in this regard. (4) The impact of death on the community, and how it reintegrates itself. The function of the funeral rite is twofold: to maintain the integrity of the community; to force the individual to work through the loss. Mourning rituals express the ambivalence of the individual and society toward the deceased and protect against projected hostility. Permanence of the loss is denied and minimized as being only a change in communica tion. Identification, mechanisms, hostility, belief in spirits, ancestor wor ship, belief in immortality, all provide advantages to the individual, fam ily, and community. Essentially they permit the denial of the permanent loss and allow for the phantasy of eventual reunion. By driving away malevolent spirits and ghosts, while setting up bar riers against the unwished-f or return of the dead, the funeral provides a channel for emotions; stresses the value of the social role played by the deceased in life; forces recognition of new relationships with the de ceased; and reintegrates the group, all helping to cope with the loss. In preliterate societies, bereavement pathology is less common be cause of a) proximity to natural processes; b) absence of intense involve ment and availability of substitute resources; d) prescribed rituals that aid in working through the loss; c) persistent belief that the person is not really lost. As these factors are less significant in our society, death is alien and frightening; hence the bereavement reaction is severe, often producing pathological states. BIBLIOGRAPHY i.
