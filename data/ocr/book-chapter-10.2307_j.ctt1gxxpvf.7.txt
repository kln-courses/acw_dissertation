<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 1 In the shadow of all this death dasotInhflelieasdthow Deborah Bird Rose We live in a time of almost unfathomable loss, and we are called to respond. We are called to respond to that which we cannot fully under- stand, and we are called to understand why and how we are called. We will be shaping our understandings as we shape our responses, and we will increasingly understand that our responses are offerings into the unknowable. We howl in the dark for the loss that surrounds us now, and for all that is coming. Our howling starts from within, from em- pathy, grief, and much more, and it reverberates beyond us. At the same time, other howls reach us and penetrate us, amplifying not only our voices but our meaning. As we are now within the sixth mass extinction event on earth, and as we are its cause, we are howling into, and from, an extremely complicated place: the shadow of the Anthropocene. Seamus Heaney offers a poetic cry of grief and solidarity written in response to the death of his friend the Nigerian literary scholar and poet Donatus Nwoga. The poem ‘A dog was crying tonight in Wick- low also’ works with an African story of the great spirit Chukwu and the origins of death, connecting grief across continents through the fact that Wicklow is Heaney’s home town. According to the story Heaney reports, human beings wanted to return from death; they didn’t want to die forever. They told the dog to take this message to Chukwu, and the DB Rose (2013).

Sydney: Sydney University Press. 1 </page> <page sequence="2"> Animal death dog trotted off only to become distracted by another dog. Thus it was that the toad, who heard it all, went to Chukwu with a lie, saying that humans actually wanted to die forever. And Chukwu became enraged, so that nothing the dog or anyone could say would reverse his decision that death would be final. In Heaney’s great words: And nothing that the dog would tell him later Could change that vision. Great chiefs and great loves In obliterated light, the toad in mud, The dog crying out all night behind the corpse house. (Heaney 2006) Within the house of life, to use Heaney’s elegant term, are all the creatures who are born to die, including the dogs. This is our condition as earth creatures: stated in the poetics of the ethical, we are all dogs crying behind the corpse house. We did not choose death, we bear the burden of the deaths of others, and we cry. We are creatures who can- not stop death or evade it, and cannot rescue others forever; we howl for the greatness of our responsibilities and we howl for our inadequa- cies. Part One: The shadow that hovers over us all In life and death we are never alone, either as individuals or as species. Others precede us, we come after, and thus we are in their shadow. James Hatley offers an important analysis of the inter-generational gifts that constitute the relationship between death and life through time. He holds that one’s ‘kind’, that is, group or race, or species, is the result of ‘an on-going series of ethical relationships’ (2000, 60). One’s kind only comes in the aftermath of generation, of one’s being-birthed (219). In accepting the great fact that life always comes after the deaths of oth- ers, we understand ourselves to be in the shadow, and also in the debt, of those who came before. Without them we would not be alive. This shadow of the lives and deaths of all those who preceded us must also be understood as a multispecies shadow, immensely great and never fully knowable (Rose 2012). 2 </page> <page sequence="3"> 1 In the shadow of all this death Another story that addresses death and its place in life belongs to Ngarinman people whose homeland is along the Wickham River in the north-west part of the Northern Territory of Australia. I lived and learned from people in the communities of Yarralin and Lingara for many years, and the story of death was first shared with me by people who are now deceased. I am very much in their debt, and in their shadow. This story of death involves the Moon and the Dingo, and it artic- ulates the ethics of our place, that is the place of animals, within the shadow of death. As Daly Pulkara, and other Dingo lawmen, told the stories, the Moon’s claim to fame is that he dies and returns as himself. Every month he disappears and every month he comes back. There is no death for the Moon. There is, however, a terrible loneliness. He has no mates, no fellow creatures; there is only the one Moon. So he offers Dingo eternal life, but there is a catch. The Dingo will have to become a sycophant of the Moon. The Dingo refuses, and so the Moon starts taunting him and daring him, urging him to die and return, to try to do as the Moon does. ‘Die,’ the Moon said. ‘Die as I do and come back again in four days time.’ The Dingo reckoned he couldn’t do it. But the Moon kept daring him, and so he decided to take the gamble. As Daly told the story, the Dingo knew it wouldn’t work, and his final words were: ‘You can’t see me come out in four days. I’ll go forever.’ And that is what happened. Unlike the Moon, however, the Dingo was not alone. His mates were there too, and they called out to him: ‘ “What’s the good, poor bugger? Come back, come back . . . ” ’ Again and again they called, but he was truly gone. That was the first death, and its long shadow is with us today. Nobody wants to die, but there he was, this Dreaming Dingo, pressured into a contest he thought he would lose, and then abandoned by the Moon who had persuaded him. Daly and others heaped blame on the Moon: ‘Why that Moon never go back and help him?’ Daly asked. ‘That Moon should have said: “Ah, that’s bad. No good you stay dead like that. Why don’t you come back again?” ’ Along with the obvious task of giving an origin to the fact of death, this story tells us about that place where a living being is slipping inevit- ably into death: not yet dead, but not able to come back. This threshold is the death zone: the place where the living and the dying encounter 3 </page> <page sequence="4"> Animal death each other in the presence of that which cannot be averted. Death is imminent but has not yet arrived. The Dingo has started to follow the Moon, and perhaps he hears the Moon laughing in triumph. I ima- gine he poured forth a great howling lamentation as he disappeared forever. But at the same time he would have heard his mates. Their voices, raised in the haunting harmonies of dingoes, were calling ‘Come back, come back . . .’ The beautiful wailing voices of those who live on offer solidarity in the face of death. They tell us of two aspects of the condition of coming ‘after’. We live after death in the sense that the deaths of others precede us. We come after that Dingo, and so we die. But there is more. We live on after the deaths of others. And so we live with the dying of others. As long as we live we are surrounded by death, and until it is time for our own death we are the ones who call out to the dying, who stay with the dying, but who do not accompany them into death. We go on living even as they are dying, and we go on living after they are gone. The Moon and Dingo story offers a momentous ethical call which is stated as plain fact: we live in the world that exists after that first death. It articulates two courses of action: the Moon’s course is to push others toward death and then abandon them. He finds triumph in hard-heartedness. The Dingo’s course of action is to counter loss with mateship, to refuse to abandon others, to howl in solidarity. We are not the Moon, we don’t live forever. We are social animals enmeshed in bonds of solidarity, and we are members of the wider family of those who cry behind the corpse house. Exactly here, where to be alive is to be implicated in the lives and deaths of others; exactly here we are called into an ethics of proximity and responsibility. Because we live after, we bear the burden of witness. In one sense, simply to be alive is to bear witness, by virtue of one’s own embodied life, to the others who came before, but the actual ethical burden entails embracing those relation- ships. Here in the midst of life we are entangled within a particular kinship; we are beneficiaries of, and contributors to, the family of those who are born to die. The expression of our ethical lives will be visible in how we inhabit the death zone: how we call out, how we refuse to aban- don others, how we refuse hard-heartedness, and thus how we embrace the precious beauty that permeates the house of life. The stories of death that I have dealt with tell us that neither life nor death nor the threshold between is exclusively for humans. Thom 4 </page> <page sequence="5"> 1 In the shadow of all this death van Dooren expresses this point eloquently: ‘Death . . . positions all or- ganisms (including humans; a point that shouldn’t have to be made, but unfortunately often does), as parts of a broader multispecies com- munity. Possibilities for life and death, for everyone, get worked out inside these entangled processes . . .’ (2011, 48). In short, and again quoting van Dooren, we are ‘interwoven into a system in which we live and die with others, live and die for others’ (2002, 10). It is with the most precious complexity that the shadow of death is entangled within the house of life, and we are always implicated in encounters at the threshold. Part Two: In the house of life The philosopher Lev Shestov made the point that it takes a certain kind of craziness to love all that is doomed to perish. His context was a rave against ‘reason’, by which he meant scientific positivism, certain forms of rationality, and other aspects of modernity. He equated modern- ity’s philosophical reason with a majestic and dispassionate unity that universalised truth and morality by suppressing the particular, the con- tingent and the ephemeral, including most especially the life that ends in death. He asserted that if we were to reject this universalising eras- ure of the particular, then there ‘will break forth innumerable selfhoods that philosophy has kept in fetters during the course of thousands of years with their unsatisfied desires, with their inconsolable sorrows . . .’ (Shestov 1982, 85). In the face of these calls of desire and grief, Shestov urges us ‘to learn anew to be horrified, to weep, to curse, to lose and find again the last hope’. That hope, for Shestov, is an ‘enigmatic craziness’ that he finds in relation to God (87). In following his logic, I argue for a kind of crazy love that is directed toward earth life (Rose 2011b, 108–11). This is exactly what is called for in the death zone, but not only there, and not only amongst humans. Throughout the whole of the house of life, crazy love springs forth in the face of death. I will explore the practice of crazy love through a story of an al- batross couple and their chick. The small part of the story I share here is the tip of a beautiful iceberg. It concerns Laysan albatross on the Hawaiian island of Kaua’i. These fantastic birds fly 80,000 or more kilo- 5 </page> <page sequence="6"> Animal death metres annually to gather food from the North Pacific and raise their chicks on islands in the temperate waters around Hawaii. It is possible to walk amongst them, even when they are nesting. This in itself is a very odd experience for a human, accustomed as we are to the fact that so many other animals fear us and seek to get away from us.1 They mate for life, and show significant site fidelity as well, often re- turning to make nests where they were hatched. One couple raises one chick per year; they take it in turns to sit on the egg, each one going out to feed for several weeks while the other one takes their turn on the nest. The parent on the nest neither eats nor drinks while they wait for their mate to return – sometimes, as in this story, one parent may wait more than five weeks for his mate to relieve him (Safina 2002, 4–6). Albatross go through an adolescence that lasts several years, and during this time one of their great activities is dance. They are courting, in ethological terminology, working out who they will partner with, but, as we will see, dance is communicative in contexts other than courting, and along with dance there is also a lot of vocalisation and grooming. The story of the particular couple I relate here is connected to the story of a human couple named Louise and Rick. Their home is situated on a bluff overlooking the ocean on the small island of Kaua’i, north-west of Oahu. Here the albatross couple courted and danced, and last year they built a nest and had their first egg together.2 This was a new nesting location for albatross – there was no record of any al- batross nesting here before. Louise and Rick said that they felt deeply honoured to have the birds select their yard for their nest. The nest was just inches from the house, and Louise and Rick observed the birds, the nest, and the egg over the next eight weeks. They cherished the fact that they were living so close to the albatross, and they asked some native Hawaiian friends to help name the birds. Accordingly, the female was 1 The albatross’ lack of fear has contributed to their vulnerability to rapacious human desires for consumption – a desire for feathers for women’s hats, for example, that drove one albatross species to the absolute edge of extinction, and a desire for albumen – used in photography – that fuelled an egg poaching industry on Midway Island that also had devastating effects on the North Pacific albatross. The population probably dropped from about 10 million to about one million birds (Safina 2002, 80–81, 183–84; Ruttle n.d.). 2 Rick, Louise and Hob Osterlund (from the Albatross Network) deduce that this was the first egg the couple had. 6 </page> <page sequence="7"> 1 In the shadow of all this death named Makana, meaning ‘the freely given gift’, and the male became Kūpa’a meaning ‘steadfast, loyal, protector, good provider’. Louise took notes on everything. She saw the egg being laid, she knew when the dad returned to give the mum a break. She knew when the dad started getting so weak, after five weeks of patient brooding, that he actually had to leave the egg. And she and Rick knew from albatross biologists that there was a grace period of about four days during which the chick would survive unattended, if a parent returned to continue incubating it. They waited tensely to see what would hap- pen, and they were incredibly relieved when the mother returned after three days. Not long after the mother returned, the father also came in. And by now it was clear to all that something was wrong with the egg. Here I take up the story in Louise’s and Rick’s own words. Louise: When we came back to our house on the afternoon of the third day, we saw she was there, and then he came back on the 31st, 12 days later, and that’s when the egg was broken. We think it had broken that morning, because I’d been watching it and it seemed okay. That was when it was really sad. We did nothing but cry that whole day, pretty much. Because they, Makana and Kūpa’a, were out there mourning and crying. They were crying this most mournful . . . Rick: They were crying! Louise: We were all crying. You could tell it was a different sound. They were doing the ‘sky moo’, but instead of their ‘oooh, oooh’, it was ‘aah, aah’ [wailing]. It was sad. Awful. Just awful. Rick: But she did sit on it for those 12 days, and she was talking to it and moving it, and then on the morning that he came back again, she got off the nest and the egg was flat. Louise: The egg had been getting darker, too. The colour of it had changed. There was a chick inside, but it was dead. It was already kind of crushed a little, and mixed in with the dirt. You could see feathers, down. Rick: So Kūpa’a came up, and Makana stood up to greet him, and it appeared that he understood what the situation was sooner than she did. Or, that he was able to accept it. 7 </page> <page sequence="8"> Animal death Louise: I don’t think she knew before that, that the egg was broken. Rick: She may have been in that trance state. So, she kept on try- ing to sit on it, and he would talk to her. He was starting to groom her. And she started to appear to realise that there was a problem with the egg, and they started to grieve. She really struggled to accept it – the loss of their chick. We can’t do anything but anthropomorph- ise, because from their behaviour it appeared that she didn’t want to accept that the egg was gone. And so she’d try to rearrange it in the nest, and she’d talk to it, and he would talk to it and then he would try to comfort her. Aah, it was difficult. And it was difficult for them. You could tell that they really struggled with their emotions. Louise: It was just like he was saying, ‘This is what’s happened and you’ve got to accept it’. He would nuzzle her, and talk to her, and a couple of times she almost appeared to be saying ‘Leave me alone’ to him. She almost was just drawing back from his grooming, and you could just see that he was trying to get her to understand, and she knew but she didn’t want to accept it. It really seemed very clear. Rick: He wasn’t making any effort to get her off so he could sit on the egg. So he really knew there was no reason to continue sitting on the nest. But he stayed with her for a good three, four hours. Louise: He’d walk away a few times, and then he’d come back and try to comfort her. But it was a long time. Then about 12:30, she went out and walked over there, waited for the wind, took off, and then changed her mind. She just totally changed her mind, like say- ing ‘I’m not going’. She crash landed and she ran back over here. She just couldn’t leave . . . couldn’t leave. And she sat on the nest. She sat on the nest a lot. And he kept trying to groom her and trying to get her to accept it, and it’s like she knew it, but it was like she said ‘I don’t care’. He finally left at 1:10. She tried to leave three other times, and went back to the nest, and finally she left at 4:30. She’d get up, she’d walk out there, she’d look around. I couldn’t tell if she was waiting for the wind to be right and she was ready, or if she was trying to decide if she should go yet. So she finally left about 4:30 in the afternoon. Rick: They had left separately. Which makes the next part even more remarkable. Louise: On February 9, that’s about the time the egg would have hatched if it had lived, they came back. 8 </page> <page sequence="9"> 1 In the shadow of all this death Rick: Together. Louise: Together. Yes. So how can you not think, I mean, it’s just impossible not to think that they knew that that was the time it would have hatched. It’s just too coincidental. Rick: So they came back to the nest, they talked to the egg re- mains, and they grieved. They comforted each other. Louise: Yes, they both went right over to the nest and started do- ing the same things they were doing when they realised that the egg was not going to hatch. Rick: But they didn’t try to sit on it. They talked to it. Louise: Right, they talked to it. Rick: And they grieved and they sat near the nest but they didn’t sit on the nest. Louise: Yes, they sat near it, around it. They’d get up and walk around, and then come back and sit near the nest. Talk some more. And that was really sad, too. They were there a few hours if I remem- ber right. Rick: There’s no doubt they knew exactly what had been their egg. They weren’t picking up a stone or talking to a stone, they were talking to the egg remains. But the story doesn’t end . . . because they came back. They came back a week later, together. They went to the nest, they grieved for a while. And then they . . . they went out in the yard and they danced. Louise: We’ve read, or someone’s told us, that Laysan albatross only dance until they commit, until they decide that they are each other’s mate. But they were dancing, and they clearly had decided be- fore this that they were each other’s mate. They were dancing just like teenagers, like young courting albatrosses do. And then they were around for probably another month. Rick: They came back almost daily, and the appearance was that they were deciding where their nest was going to be next year. They walked all along the driveway here, and they’d pick a spot and they’d settle down, spend a couple of days there, and then try another spot. The albatross left for the months they spend in the air, and, as of the time of writing, Louise and Rick are waiting for their return. In reflect- ing on these events, Louise again pointed to the difficulty and necessity of telling stories like this: 9 </page> <page sequence="10"> Animal death And even if our interpretation of it is wrong, it is clear that they were experiencing something, their behaviour was different, they have a relationship; there was clearly a process going on, even if it is not ex- actly as we interpret it; there was a process they were going through to relate what had happened, and get through what had happened. The story of how Louise and Rick came to have these albatross dancing, mating and nesting in their yard is part of a wider story of multispecies conviviality. It is driven in part by a remarkable woman named Hob Osterlund who has organised the Kaua’i Albatross Network and who is indefatigable in her love and advocacy of albatross. The story is too long to tell fully here, but the main point is that many people in this area have so loved sharing their lives and properties with albatross that they are now involved in programs to assist the birds to relocate from places of potential harm to these places of relative safety. The most massive potential harm, of course, is sea level rise. Ninety percent of the Laysan albatross nest on Midway Island. If sea levels rise as anticipated due to anthropogenic climate change, their nesting ground will no longer exist (Safina 2002, 166–67). People in Kaua’i and other islands are developing transitional eco- logies that will help albatross form new fidelities to places where they will continue to be safe even in the event of sea level rise. They are enticed by decoys that give the impression of dancing albatross, and the decoys are accompanied by solar-panelled speakers, disguised as stones, that broadcast albatross sounds of happy dancers. The crazy love that albatross demonstrate for their mate and chick encounters the crazy love of people who are doing all they can to help them thrive. Exactly here, within the shadow of the Anthropocene, ex- actly here we encounter the crazy love that keeps calling others back from the edge of disaster, and staying with those who grieve in the wake of death. Part Three: Ethical poetics in the shadow of the Anthropocene The philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas’ life work has been summarised in the single phrase ‘ethics as first philosophy’. He argued, again and again, the two sides of ethics: the entanglements that bring forth subjectivity, 10 </page> <page sequence="11"> 1 In the shadow of all this death and the refusal to justify or ignore the sufferings of others (Bernasconi 1986; Lévinas 1989). This philosophy is, I believe, uniquely relevant to the Anthropocene, for Lévinas came to the view that if philosophy is to be capable of responding to violence, and to refuse the idea that might makes right, it must start with ethics. The heart of ethics is the call from the other. One only comes into becoming within the entangled worlds of life and death through others and though one’s response and responsibility to others. One of the terms Lévinas uses to talk about the call is the face. Whether aural or visual, the other’s claim on me arrives to interrupt my self-absorption and awaken me to my responsibility as a living subject, which is to say, as an ethical subject. Lévinas’ definition of the face that is particularly pertinent to my analysis is: the face is the most basic mode of responsibility. As such . . . the face is the other before death, looking through and exposing death . . . [T]he face is the other who asks me not to let him die alone, as if to do so were to become an accomplice in his death. Thus the face says to me: ‘you shall not kill’. (Lévinas &amp; Kearney 1986, 23–24) There are actually two messages in this statement, and each deserves attention. There is the command against killing, and there is the plea not to be abandoned. Philosophers have devoted themselves primarily to the command not to kill, but the plea may be even more complex, requiring, as it does, that we save the lives we can save, and that we remain faithful to those whose lives we cannot save. As Judith Butler reads Lévinas, this plea awakens us to the precariousness of the lives of others, and thereby to the precariousness of all life (2004, 134). A Dingo reading of Lévinas urges us to focus on the appeal not to be left to die alone. In pressing the significance of this plea, I am moved by how Lévinas subtly reminds us that actually and ultimately we cannot prevent the deaths of others. In practical and beautiful ways, however, we can refuse to abandon them. Sometimes, in fact, we may even be able to help them return from the death zone. The call of those in peril expresses their longing always for connection within the world of life. We are doubly responsible – first we have the responsibility to hear that call, and secondly we have the responsibility to respond to it. 11 </page> <page sequence="12"> Animal death The refusal to abandon others therefore depends in the first in- stance on appreciating that there is a call. There are many reasons why we do not hear the calls of others. Geographical distance may be a factor, but all too often there are cultural reasons such as, for example, the philosophical move to refuse the idea that animal deaths concern us. And there are certainly political reasons too – we may not know what is happening, or our ignorance may be strategic. Deliberate ig- norance is explained and expressed vividly by David Clark when he writes of ‘the alibis that always put the human somewhere else, doing something else when it comes to killing animals and dehumanized or animalized humans’ (1999, 185). Perhaps these numerous factors lead to the atrophy of our ethical senses. Perhaps, as Richard Flanagan sug- gests, ‘We have grown autistic to the natural world’ (2012). But in addition to these specific reasons, there is a larger issue that claims us: what is happening to other creatures in this era of mass an- thropogenic death may be too large to think, too unprecedented to know how to imagine. And still we are called. For many reasons, then, we need an ethical poetics that brings us into proximities that awaken us both to others and to ourselves, and thus to our responsibilities. Such an ethical poetics will return us to the death zone, and to the crazy love that makes possible the refusal to abandon others. One such expression of ethical poetics is Janet Laurence’s exhibi- tion ‘After Eden’. It was shown first at the Sherman Gallery in Sydney and funded by the Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation. Let us enter the gallery, stepping from a hot and bright street into the calm, cool foyer. The gallery is lit as if night were suddenly upon us. When you walk in, your eyes have to adjust, and for a brief moment you are not sure where to put your feet. You wonder where the next step should be, and this uncertainty will be with you the whole time. It will become integral to the experience – not that you are lost, but that your certainty is off balance. After that first disorienting moment when your body is out of kilter with its surrounds, you realise that something is near. As your eyes fumble to adjust, other eyes gaze at you. The installation of owls and nightjars is not so much a greeting as an enticement. These glowing eyes seem already to be at home, to know more than you, and to beckon. You have to remind yourself that they are not alive. In fact, 12 </page> <page sequence="13"> 1 In the shadow of all this death every nonhuman body in this room is dead, but the depths of all this death will only enter your consciousness gradually. A few steps bring you into a more open space and to your left you encounter a place of possible healing. Preserved bodies of koalas and Tasmanian devils are surrounded with vials, tubes, healing plants, and spills of blood. Already, before you have fully left the glowing eyes of owls, you are facing a death zone. Amongst the wounded are others who call out with tender care. Not just humans, but plants and water become part of the attempt to heal. The call to come back is visible in these healing gestures. But nothing you know about the future for ko- alas or devils leads you to sunny optimism. An exquisite tenderness arises here: whatever the outcome, care is offered. Around you there is a distant call of an owl. Images move and reflect. Veils of gauze surround much of what you see, and there are also screens on which images are projected in ghostly beauty. And al- ways there is this light, invoking the haunting sense that, in Richard Flanagan’s evocative words, ‘We live in the twilight of some terrible mo- ment, the meaning of which we can only grasp at’ (2012). The burden of living in a world dominated by humans is becoming tangible. One starts to sense the incommensurate gap between our ca- pacity to harm and our capacity to avert all that harm. In the section called ‘Sanctuaried’, Laurence uses film to allow us to see into a place where protection is both a blessing and a life sentence. Here are films of elephants and pandas. Exactly because the film is not representa- tional, you realise that no representation can capture all this (Butler 2004, 144). Vision can behold, but cannot contain. The languid motion is close, slow, intimate, strange. Nothing can or should contain these images, for they bear witness and so offer an opening into ethics. We see them over and over, as if the lives continue, and continue, and I want to express something in the manner of a prayer: ‘let them live’, I think, ‘let them live’. And ‘if only’, I think. ‘If only’ there were a world in which they did not have to carry all this weight. A world in which there were no chains across the elephant’s shoulders and around their ankles, a world in which they could escape this liminal zone between the hu- mans who seek to kill them and the humans who seek to save them. Everywhere you look is a knife in the heart. I pulled up a stool and sat with the dingo in an area titled ‘Love and extinction’. Taxidermy is clearly a fine and artful skill. This is and is not a dingo, and the dis- 13 </page> <page sequence="14"> Animal death sonance between all that it is and all that it is not is troubling. The proximity of a photo of a Tasmanian tiger adds to the disturbance that is fracturing my sense of ‘we’. ‘I’ am here – in all my inadequacy. I en- counter myself as one who cries behind the corpse house, longing for those ‘we’ have killed, and unable to save those ‘we’ are now killing. In the centre of the gallery we encounter a circular display bearing the title ‘Anthropocene’. The shelves are layered, and the whole con- struction is surrounded by gauze. There are barn owls that look like mummies, and there are the delicate bones of flying foxes. There are the bodies of myriad brightly coloured little birds, in all the glorious del- icacy of smooth feathers, tiny brittle beaks and feet, and the startling stillness of wings that beat no more. You can walk around, and around. You can look at every individual on every shelf, and in every group. You can think about every slender bone that once held up a leathery wing to beat through the night sky in search of blossoms and nectar. You can think of hoots and squabbles, songs and chirps. And you cannot find a depth that feels deep enough to be with them properly. Of course, you tell yourself, this is how it is in the house of life: everything that lives will die. We know this. But here, every creature bears a label. The section as a whole has a label too: ‘Anthropocene’. The dead bodies are not allowed to decay: they are tagged, counted, described, and held in climate-controlled environments for safe-keeping. This ‘Anthropocene’ is a mirror. It seems that we are creatures who not only abandon life, pushing it over the brink and letting it go, but who also carefully curate the specimens. Laurence’s ‘After Eden’ offers another dimension to being ‘after’. Recall that, in Hatley’s analysis, to be after others is to be situated in cross-generational relationships such that one is always after others, and for the future. But in the face of the dead bodies, curated for pos- terity while the living creatures and species are lost to the world forever, we see a more terrible possibility of being after. This is the after of those whose living others are no more. It is the after of those who inhabit a crowded loneliness surrounded by superbly studied and curated dead bodies. And yet, the bright little bodies grasp us and insist that we ac- knowledge that there is luminosity even here in this shadow of the Anthropocene. Laurence’s ‘After Eden’ seems to want to capture the am- biguity of ‘after’, an ambiguity that includes after in the sense of forever 14 </page> <page sequence="15"> 1 In the shadow of all this death gone, as well as the sense of always happening. We live after that first Eden in the sense that we are always outside the gates of paradise. And yet in so far as we still live in a world of (diminishing) life, Eden still surrounds us. Every creature is a fragment of creation, a chip off the great block of earth life. We live now at a threshold of generational transition in which the future will either collapse into death or will flourish in new life. Paradise is not wholly lost, Laurence seems to be saying. There was and is a world in which every song had a singer, and every singer had a home. Outside the gallery birds still sing, but in the chamber called ‘Anthropocene’ they are enshrouded by ghostly silence. Part Four: In the shadow of Eden I turn now to an Eden story that is taking place in close proximity. The expulsion part of the Eden narrative is one of the great stories of the Western world, and it is repeated again and again as we experi- ence the trauma of loss, and seek to remake the world into some vision of paradise (Merchant 2004). We seem to want to hold to the con- viction that if we could expel or exterminate all those who annoy us, our particular version of paradise would be secure. I am referring to huge issues of colonisation, extermination, dislocation, genocide, eco- cide, speciocide and more. We know this story as ethnic cleansing, with visions of racial or religious purity, and we know it again and again in relation to animals. Let us consider the awful life prospects of animals who are condemned by the slippery label ‘pest’. When an animal is de- clared a pest, death becomes its destiny. Suddenly, whatever it does is wrong in the eyes of those who are determined to get rid of it. And sud- denly wherever it is, that is where it must not be. A purist vision arises at the Gates of Eden in which perfection is imagined to be always on a near horizon, and violent death lurks in powerful policy and practice cloaked in the aura of management. The particular garden in which this violence in now being enacted is Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens, and the species now being perse- cuted are flying foxes. The most common species in Sydney is the grey- headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus). Like the other Australian Pteropus species, they navigate principally by sight, feed exclusively on plant foods, and are among the largest flying mammals on earth. With 15 </page> <page sequence="16"> Animal death their long-distance capacity to pollinate and disperse seeds, they are a keystone species for native Australian forests and woodlands with which they are co-evolved. If flying foxes become extinct, either wholly or ‘in the wild’, that which remains of Australian native forests will also be imperilled. The great eucalypts that make south eastern Australia the unique place that it is depend in large measure on the work that flying foxes do for trees (Hall &amp; Richards 2000; Booth et al. 2008). For well over a century, whitefella settlers did their utmost to ex- terminate flying foxes. With government approval, they shot, poisoned, gassed, burnt, and electrocuted these creatures. They cut down their maternity camps, created a great variety of forms of harassment to drive them away, paid a bounty for the corpses, and even bombed them (Martin &amp; McIlwee 2002; see also Rose 2011a). Flying fox numbers are plummeting at this time, they are listed as threatened, and they are federally protected. And yet, in Queensland the government issued a decree on 7 September 2012, Threatened Species Day, allowing all four species of flying foxes to be shot. There was legislation against cruelty to animals, and shooting had been deemed to be cruel, so the govern- ment had to exempt flying foxes from the cruelty legislation. Suddenly, it seems, pain doesn’t matter if the creature experiencing it is unwanted, and suddenly, it seems, extinction doesn’t matter either, if the creature tumbling into the abyss of loss is unwanted. In NSW, where Sydney is located, flying foxes are legally shot by orchardists who are issued li- censes to do so, and they can now be legally harassed. Flying foxes are notable for their site fidelity. Maternity camps are central to the future of flying foxes generations, for these are where mothers gather to give birth and congregate for protection of the young. The most spectacular Sydney camp is in the Royal Botanic Gar- dens. The trees the flying foxes have chosen to camp in are heritage trees, deemed to be valuable because of their rarity; they are non-native trees and they have suffered under the continuous presence of flying foxes (Leishman 2007). The Royal Botanic Gardens has a statutory duty to protect these specimens, and the only option they are prepared to ad- opt is to expel the flying foxes. In 2010 the Botanic Gardens was granted permission by the federal Minister for the Environment to embark upon a 30-year process of expelling the flying foxes through the use of noise harassment. The pro- cedure is designed to cause pain and distress. That is what it takes to 16 </page> <page sequence="17"> 1 In the shadow of all this death break site fidelity: success depends on the trauma that can be inflicted upon flying foxes. There has been a lot of debate and protest, and every major point has been made: trees can be netted, it doesn’t have to be either-or; a botanic gardens should be especially attentive toward a key- stone species that is so crucial to trees; causing stress to a threatened species is not appropriate; expelling members of a threatened species from a maternity camp is not appropriate; stressing pregnant females is not appropriate; co-existence is possible, it would cost less than ex- pulsion, and would set a benchmark for good practice. Nonetheless, the procedure started on 4 June 2012. In Laurence’s ‘After Eden’ we saw an image of ourselves as a species that pushes others into the death zone, abandons them, and then claims the bodies for specimens. Similarly, in the Botanic Gardens, ‘asset pro- tection’ trumps living creatures, and specimens trump future genera- tions. In a move that bears alarming similarity to the famous decree that ‘death solves all problems’ (attributed to Stalin), the problem of protecting trees is presented as amenable only to one solution: the elim- ination of flying foxes. All this violence, vilification and trauma, and all this intransigent refusal to embrace co-existence stems from a will to power enacted on the bodies of flying foxes as they seek to sustain their lives in the garden that is their home. Those of us who raise our voices to try to stop the vi- olence, and who are committed to not abandoning flying foxes in their time of persecution, find ourselves living with our own inadequacy, and living with the sense of shame that arises in the face of unstoppable cruelty. It takes crazy love to keep defending the lives of the persecuted, and over time it puts us in a place of witness to the apparently unstoppable and the increasingly unimaginable. This is a place of emotional turmoil and exhaustion. In the eloquently understated words of one flying fox carer: ‘we are not holding up very well here’. I started by discussing unfathomable loss and the need to respond. It is clear that part of the response must be to our fellow humans who are at the front lines in the expanding death zones of the Anthropocene. In this terrible time we need blessings as well as exhortations, and yet every blessing must, I believe, be complicated by the knowledge of all this death. Peter Boyle’s poem ‘Dawn Ritual of Purification for famil- ies and descendants of those who participate in slaughter’ is a guide to 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> Animal death making peace; it homes in on our condition, and expresses the desire to be other than those who kill and those who abandon (2009, 91–92). The final portion of the poem pulls these themes into this time of death: To the west eyeing the west as an equal eyeing the west as a mother eyeing the west as your child scatter the grain scatter the bright joy of water kneel kneel do not speak wait for the light that rises and sets to touch you wait for the winds that come from the lands of all the dead to filter around your ears wait for their voices to enter you wait till their voices speak wait till the words are fierce and tender wait till the words tear at the sinews of pain till the words slice through forehead and skull till the heart is open to all words the earth is struggling to say Kneel longer wait till their voices cease wait till the silence steadies you speak “Brothers” speak “Sisters” speak “I give back I give back” 18 </page> <page sequence="19"> 1 In the shadow of all this death Acknowledgements The research on which this paper is based was carried out under a grant from the Australian Research Council (DP110102886).
