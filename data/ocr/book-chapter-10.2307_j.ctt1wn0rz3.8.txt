<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 1EU cross-border Passagenwerk Olivier Thomas Kramsch For us, the solution was in the direction of the horizon. We were those who scruti- nised the horizon. We looked forward, not back. To the question, ‘What is thinking?’  we didn’t respond, ‘Being’ [like Heidegger] but with ‘the possible’. (Henri Lefebvre,  cited in Hess 1988: 54) Thoughts from a deckchair in Wyler, Germany Walking through the village of Wyler, the last German settlement before the border  crossing into the Netherlands, one drifts past cavernous, odoriferous farmhouses,  fleeting images of green fields tucked between stolidly built single-family homes,  thick, tall shrubbery, and then, on the left: the hulking grey carapace of a defunct  border truck stop (Figure 1.1), and passing that again: a small sandy beach pocked  with two flimsy canvas deckchairs flanked by an awkward attempt at a fountain in a  low-lying pool spraying mistily into the thin sunshine (see Figure 1.2). The ‘beach’  is attached to a newly expanded travel agency which caters largely to a Dutch clien- tele and forms part of its ‘exotica’-inducing public relations strategy. Experiencing  the juxtaposition of the ruins of border infrastructure with the travel agency’s  ‘beach’, at the forward edge of two major European states, invites the bordercrosser  to dream ... References to ‘walking’, ‘drifting’ and ‘dreaming’ are of course intimately asso- ciated with the practices of early twentieth-century artistic movements such as  Dadaism and Surrealism, whose advocates attempted to counter the rationalising  and instrumentalising impulses of modern capitalism with an artistic sensibility  capable of foregrounding the still potent realms of memory, the unconscious and  the irrational in modern social life (Bigsby 1972; Henning 1979; Bradley 1997).  Such a sensibility would find expression not only in poetry, literature, painting  and sculpture, but would find further inspiration in the vast, teeming spaces of  the modern metropolis, whose chaotic flows, unpredictable sequences of events  and opaque and shadowy interstices provided the ideal sensorium for the c lassical  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   25 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="2"> 26 Migrating borders and moving times 1.1 Ruins of border truck stop, Wyler, Germany 1.2 ‘Beach’ in front of Hagemann’s travel agency, Wyler, Germany flâneur (or flâneuse) (Aragon 1926). This chapter seeks to draw on the unruly ener- gies spawned by these earlier, urban-based political and artistic avant-gardes in  order to explore questions of time, memory and mobility within a contemporary  internal European borderland, located between Germany and the Netherlands.  The ‘method’ of modern flânerie will specifically allow me to connect the temporal  dimension of this borderland to a recent and growing interest in the fields of social  and cultural geography with practices of ‘walking’. Current attention to ambulatory practices within human geography can be  productively understood as emerging within the context of a widely heralded ‘affec- tive turn’ in the field (Thrift 2008). As a result of this development, the emotional,  experiential and embodied dimensions of space are foregrounded not only as a new  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   26 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="3">  EU cross-border Passagenwerk 27 frontier for empirical analysis but as useful in setting ambitious social-theoretical  agendas aiming beyond the perceived limitations associated with traditional politi- cal-economy perspectives (Pile 2010; Jones and Evans 2012; Navaro-Yashin 2012;  Sparke 2012). A lively interest in the ‘geographies of walking’ is further informed by  concerns with the politico-aesthetic conditions for negotiating and resisting scopic  regimes of modern state power, largely within the urban realm (Crary 1990; Jay  1993; Pinder 2011); as a tactic capable of rendering visible a historical, relational  and ‘affective geopolitics’ of state sovereignty (Sidaway 2009), and as a potentially  productive pathway for charting the normative valences associated with heightened  ‘mobilities’ across the social sciences (Urry 2007; Cresswell and Merriman 2011).  This chapter builds on the foregoing literature, but argues that the shadowy figure of  the border flâneur can reveal tensions and contradictions in the workings of modern  state power that cannot be captured simply by urban- or state-centric narratives of  space walking. At the fringes of state territoriality, the flâneur becomes a bordering  body, literally in-corporealising a border-crossing experience within himself. The  experiential force of such a ‘limit event’ opens the body not only ‘against’ a singu- lar border but channels it to an affective transnationalism connecting it to myriad  border sites not contained by the state line proper (Kramsch and Dimitrovova  2008; Kramsch 2016). It is here, in effect, that the act of border walking invokes a  critical comparative lens that refuses to be subsumed under a monolingual regime  of state power purportedly enforced at the border. And it is here that such an  embodied border perspective could add something new to urban-centred debates,  particularly as they relate to current anxieties relating to the properly political  dimension of ambulatory mobility across time and space (Pinder 2001; Cresswell  2006). In short, this chapter argues that by bringing the past and present into a dynamic  ‘constellation’ while crossing the national border, the border flâneur actively pro- duces the border as an emotionally charged, future-oriented horizon. Understood  in this way, the horizon invites us to rethink our notion of political borders as  merely a geographic endpoint between states, as the expression of the limits of state  sovereignty or as the interface between mutually ignorant ‘homogenous empty’  times, as the temporality of the nation has so eloquently been described by Benedict  Anderson (1983). Parrying the notion of borders defined primarily as sites for the  articulation of hostile and mutually ignorant socio-spatial differences (i.e. ‘Us vs.  Them’), the notion of horizon mobilised in this chapter suggests a space-time of  the ‘possible’ in the sense expressed by Henri Lefebvre in the epigraph opening this  chapter: a space articulating a set of diverse and heterogeneous relations in space  and time, relations which in their intricate scalarity open up the space of the state  border to deeply affective connections with ‘other border temporalities’, as well as  to ‘other borders’ located far from the dividing line being traversed by the individual  border crosser. Importantly for our argument, the concept of horizon works within  and across the grain of different regimes of state-centric visibility, and is rooted in  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   27 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="4"> 28 Migrating borders and moving times the premise that both within the internal borders of the European Union (EU)  as well as at its outer edges the panoptic visual power of state governmentality is  always partial, never fully effective in classifying and ordering the myriad elements  of borderland life within its totalising gaze. This intuition, I argue, is what makes  possible a politics ‘of’ the border, stretching the borderline into an affective-political  ‘constellation’ suturing the past and present into a future-oriented time-space capa- ble of revealing ‘hidden’ connections and affinities between a multiplicity of border- land contexts in ways not permitted by two-dimensional cartography. But now it is time to get up from our Wyler deckchairs, stretch our legs, go for a  stroll, and in the process pick up some real and imagined fellow-travellers. Re-cognising the time-space(s) of modernity with Walter Benjamin To accompany our flânerie of the Wyler borderland I turn not to a Dadaist or  Surrealist, however, but to the mid-twentieth-century persona of Walter Benjamin,  an iconic figure of the Frankfurt School of social theory. Benjamin’s work crystal- lises a preoccupation with time, memory, movement and space that inevitably  prefigures contemporary social-theoretical debates, and indeed often serves as  their inspirational wellspring (Pred 1995; Pile 2000). For Benjamin, two tenden- cies characterised nineteenth- and twentieth-century modernity: an acceleration of  the ‘ever new’, coupled with its complement and shadow, the ‘eternal return of the  same’. The dialectical tension between these two developments produced ‘phan- tasmagoria’ (or myths), which for Benjamin were most visibly expressed through  attempts to negotiate ‘what has been’ and the social inadequacies of the present.  The production of such myths in turn set the stage for what he called ‘dreamworlds’,  real and imagined spaces produced while society still found itself ‘sleepwalking’  through the transition phase between pre-modern and fully modern forms of  socio-spatial organisation (Pile 2000). In the realm of architecture and aesthetics,  a powerful example of such a world is Jugendstil, that design form often made out of  modern industrial materials – steel, glass, cement – moulded to reveal pre-modern,  organic shapes (Benjamin 1999b). The master example of such a dreamworld was  constituted for Benjamin by the Paris Arcades, those giant, fin-de-siècle enclosed  shopping ‘streets’ framed by Jugendstil-influenced materials: ‘glass houses of the  future’ (Benjamin 1999a: 213). Sites such as the nineteenth-century Paris Arcades, which by Benjamin’s time  had lost their functionality (‘aura’), according to an older set of use values, repre- sented key locations for modern phantasmagoria, pointing to an unfulfilled future  ‘outside’ and beyond capitalism: [The Surrealists were] the first to perceive the revolutionary energies that appear in  the ‘outmoded’, in the first iron constructions, the first factory buildings, the earliest  photos, the objects that begin to be extinct, grand pianos in the salon, the dresses of  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   28 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="5">  EU cross-border Passagenwerk 29 five years ago, fashionable restaurants when the vogue has begun to ebb from them.  (Benjamin 1996: 234) The political-aesthetic task for Benjamin consisted not in showing how the past  of the Arcades influenced the present, nor how the present shed its light on the  past, but to reveal in the ruins of the Arcades a historical ‘truth’ whose ‘afterlives’  were capable of producing an ‘awakening’ into what Benjamin called the ‘now of  recognisability’. Crucial for Benjamin’s way of conceptualising history, this Jetztzeit,  which in a ‘lightning flash’ produced by a moment of ‘danger’ created a ‘new con- stellation’, had a fundamentally spatial character, rather than a temporal one. Like  the Arcades of Benjamin’s time, the extant infrastructure of border guardhouses and  customs buildings that dot the landscape of Europe’s internal borders constitute  the ‘ruins’ of our previous century, the traces of a pre-Schengen1 time when move- ment across Europe’s internal member state borders was tightly controlled. And  as in the case of the Parisian shopping streets that so fascinated Benjamin, I argue  that the remains of today’s border infrastructure exude an ‘aura’ and an ‘afterlife’  to the degree that, though they have lost their original function as points of direct  observance and control, they remain sites charged with meaning and emotional- affective power for those who live nearby, as well as for those who cross the border  in carrying out their everyday lives. We thus do not necessarily need to subscribe to  Benjamin’s larger redemptive and ‘weak messianic’ project (Pile 2000) to retrieve  from his work the idea that the ‘ruins’ of the Dutch/German border, as is similarly  the case within innumerable borderland contexts across the width and breadth of  the EU, are infused with just such an ‘aura’, caught as they are between a time of  fixed border controls that is no more and a future borderless horizon yet to come. Benjamin employed several stratagems in spatialising the temporal dimension  of the modern arcade. Drawing explicitly on the politico-aesthetic traditions of  Surrealism, he drew on the artistic practice of ‘montage’: the juxtaposition of images  (preferably photographs) so as to reveal, in the very spatial adjacency of their  arrangement, ‘surprising’ lines of force and telluric pull that could resist the violent  amalgamation of linear, historical narrative. Mobilised in this way by Benjamin,  montage would produce a particular ‘dialectic of seeing’, one which could ‘freeze’  history’s ceaseless production of castaway rubbish while enabling the emergence  of an ethical tableau in which the losers and winners of capitalist development  could exist, at a ‘standstill’, in a relation of tenuous equality (Buck-Morss 1989).  Benjamin located another spatial strategy in the practice of the dandy, or flâneur,  who, as exemplified in Louis Aragon’s Paris Peasant, strolled haphazardly through  the capital’s streets, letting the city ‘happen to him’ (Aragon 1926). Benjamin’s  flâneur has no goal, no objective, no purpose: he is a ‘collector’ of useless debris, a  pure ‘witness’ to the world around him, and, as such, its most ethically cogent critic.  From his ‘isolated’ perch, footloose on the street, the flâneur is able to witness and  report firsthand on the ravages and depredations of capitalist urbanisation, as was  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   29 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="6"> 30 Migrating borders and moving times the case for Aragon during the 1920s ‘Hausmannisation’ of Paris, whereby large  boulevards brutally cut up the dense, largely working-class Marais district. In this  respect, the practice of Surrealist or Dadaist flânerie can be associated with one of  the first critiques of capitalist urban modernity, albeit involving a ‘poetics of space’  that some subsequently conceived as being too individualist, voluntarist and quiet- ist for the mass political mobilisation required to confront this kind of urbanisation  (see especially Lefebvre 1991). As I forge a path on foot across the ruins of the  Dutch/German border, I am aware of the perceived limitations projected onto the  lone figure of the flâneur, but choose to retain his company nevertheless as a useful  guide for a kind of emotionally attentive praxis in reading the affective topographies  of this border-as-horizon. As with contemporary attempts to read, understand and  remap geographies of the city by excavating its ‘hidden histories and geographies’,  thus revealing some of ‘the other cities that exist inside the city’ (Ackroyd 1985;  Sinclair 1997; Pinder 2001: 8), I undertake in the same spirit an exploration of ‘the  other borders that exist inside the border’ that is Wyler. ‘Wyler peasant’: re-cognising the ruin The ruin of the former German border truck stop in Wyler sits like a rotting carcass  alongside a road which, not coincidentally for this walker, was formerly the Via  Romana linking marching columns of Rome’s finest to the cold, north-west barbar- ian peripheries (Figure 1.3).2 The truck stop’s mottled grey cement awning juts out  over a row of barred windows whose dark interior casts foreboding shadows on  rusty ramps facing the street. The entire area surrounding the truck stop is dotted  with weeds and overgrown grass. An air of dereliction reigns over the whole surface  of the structure, made all the more acute by being juxtaposed with the prim row  of single-family detached houses situated just opposite. As I circle the building on  foot, it feels like walking around a wartime ruin. And, in a flash, I am transported to  the images of wartime destruction which fell upon this Dutch/German borderland  during the Second World War in September 1944, when the Allies unsuccessfully  attempted to force an entry from France into Germany over the Rhine by seiz- ing bridges across the Maas, the Waal and the Lower Rhine (Korthals Altes and  Zuidgeest-Perquin 1984). In subsequent months, as the war drew to a close, the  nearby German city of Kleve would be flattened by Allied aerial bombardment,  causing hundreds of deaths, as occurred with many German cities in the final stages  of the war (see Figure 1.4) (Michels and Sliepenbeek 1964; Sebald 2003). The Dutch city of Nijmegen would not be spared, either. As it was located so  near the border, it would be mistaken for a German town by an American bomber  pilot, who proceeded to destroy much of its historic centre on 22 February 1944  (Brinkhuis 1984). Hundreds died in the ensuing fire. As part of discussions  over the immediate territorial post-war settlement between the Netherlands and  Germany, a Dutch proposal sardonically named ‘Black Tulip’ proposed moving  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   30 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="7">  EU cross-border Passagenwerk 31 1.3 Ruins of border truck stop, Wyler, Germany 1.4 Ruins of Kleve, Germany, 11 February 1945 DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   31 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="8"> 32 Migrating borders and moving times the Netherlands border into Germany by several hundred kilometres, creating  an ethnically cleansed buffer zone between the two countries. Despite the failure  of this proposal, confusion over the exact location of the border between the two  countries reigned for several months, causing its position to move erratically in the  village of Wyler. The owner of the travel agency, whose business now sits on the site  of the house where he grew up as a child, exclaims: ‘Before the war, the border ran  through [the neighbouring villages of] Beek, Berg en Dal, Groesbeek; after the war,  it moved over [our village]. Overnight, my grandmother became “Dutch”, then  later “German” again.’3 The memory of wartime destruction and the aftermath thrown up by walking  round the Wyler ‘border ruin’ tells another story of the border than that repre- sented on the existing map of north-west Europe, where ‘The Netherlands’ and  ‘Germany’ are shown as clearly delineated cartographical entities. It speaks to a  ‘hidden’ dimension of the border, one defined by a shared experience of massive  Allied aerial bombardment and the subsequent imposition of geopolitical manoeu- vrings staged from distant state capitals – The Hague and Berlin – in which the  actual lived space of borderlanders was rendered invisible. The Second World War  Raumgeist of this borderland also brings to mind repressed memories revealing how  this urbanised border was enmeshed within wider, imperial geographies of colonial  power; for centuries Nijmegen served as a training ground for the Dutch colonial  infantry (KNIL), who would depart for the global colonial theatres of Surinam and  Indonesia from the banks of Nijmegen’s River Waal (Hooghoff 2000; Kramsch  2006). When this Dutch/German borderland was bombed, Nijmegen continued  to carry out this function, as it was still actively involved in the colonial administra- tion of Indonesia. Like all haunted houses, the physical persistence of the Wyler  truck stop thus speaks to and serves as a testament to a blocked passage between  moments of wartime ruin, declining imperial power, strict national border controls  and a contemporary European horizon trapped in the uncertainties, contradictions  and ambiguities flowing from the unmastered colonial past. As if anticipating the  emotional response to such an anxiety-producing condition, graffiti on the side  of the truck stop, featuring a rose surrounded by barbed wire, screams, ‘HADER  ZEIT!’ (‘TIME OF DOUBT!’; see Figure 1.5). The effect of ‘strangeness’ produced by the difficulties of this blocked temporal  passage is exemplified in the way the truck stop, some twenty years after the formal  removal of internal European border controls, has developed a number of ‘after- lives’ for both the Dutch and German communities surrounding it. One such effect  strikes me as I round the far corner of the building: a stack of freshly cut wood lines  the lower part of a loading embankment at the rear of the structure (see Figure  1.6). Across the street, a Bratwurst vendor plies her trade. When I ask her opinion  of the truck stop, she answers: ‘The owner has tried to sell it twice, but can’t find  any buyers ... The neighbours [largely comprising Dutch transmigrants] want it to  stay as it is, rather than be converted into a car dealership or hotel.’ When I note the  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   32 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="9">  EU cross-border Passagenwerk 33 1.5 Ruins of border truck stop, Wyler, Germany, showing graffiti 1.6 Ruins of border truck stop, Wyler, Germany DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   33 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="10"> 34 Migrating borders and moving times 1.7 Former Dutch/German border guard hut, now Lotto shop. The bicycle path shows  approximately where the actual border guard hut once stood stack of freshly cut wood at the corner of the building, she adds: ‘I once saw a wed- ding party take photographs over there ... historic, you know.’4 The truck stop ruin, in short, has developed a life of its own, and takes on an  almost visibly anthropomorphic shape as it ‘stares’ out melancholically westward,  towards the site of the former Dutch/German border guardhouse, which, since the  removal of border controls in 1990, has been converted into a Lotto shop (Figure  1.7). Drifting in the direction of the truck stop’s gaze, I continue my walk past a  series of farmhouses, passing a sign set back from the street announcing the border  with the word ‘Nederland’, surrounded by a sea of blue and yellow stars. I slouch  onwards to the German Lotto shop, popular among Dutch visitors. From this van- tage point, standing exactly on the spot where the old Dutch/German border-guard  hut used to stand, I can look back and appreciate an advertising billboard attached  to the rear wall of Hagemann’s travel agency, displaying a sunny beachside tourist  destination, with what appear to be cacti filling up the foreground (see Figure 1.8).  Palm trees against an azure sky explode from the boundary of the advertising frame,  and fill up the entire wall of the building. Here, on the very spot where Germany  and the Netherlands once controlled the movement of each other’s citizens, this  gestures to a potentially happier ‘elsewhere’ beyond the Dutch/German border- land proper. This tropical island tourist paradise pictured on the outside wall of Hagemann’s  travel agency evokes a contrapuntal horizon at the Levantine edges of Europe. In  June 2004, Belgian-born and Mexico City-based performance artist Francis Alys  walked 24 km along Jerusalem’s ‘Green Line’, originally drawn as a ceasefire line by  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   34 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="11">  EU cross-border Passagenwerk 35 1.8 Advertising mural to the rear of Hagemann’s travel agency (English translation: ‘Holiday  like in a picture book!

A publicly available video accompanying Alys’s exhibit identifies  him ambling across streets and markets, negotiating paths between houses and trees,  across fields and stubbly hills while dribbling a thin line of green paint from an open  can. Exhibition patrons can choose between 11 soundtracks, each revealing a differ- ent Palestinian, Israeli or European commentator reflecting on the walk and its wider  geopolitical significance. The broader meaning of the walk, made at a time when  Ariel Sharon was constructing a new eight-metre-high cement ‘separation wall’, were  further contextualised and made public by Alys in his 2007 New York exhibition,  entitled ‘Sometimes Doing Something Poetic Can Become Political and Sometimes  Doing Something Political Can Become Poetic’. According to cultural geographer  David Pinder, the green trail of paint, quickly smudged by daily traffic and eventu- ally rendered invisible, ‘evokes both the memory and the arbitrariness of the original  line, reawakening a demarcation that was erased following Israeli expansion after the  1967 war’ (2011: 686). Pinder remarks that ‘as an artist and outsider’, Alys’s walk  raises the question of how bodies are able to move with different degrees of freedom  around this borderland, depending on their gender, ethnicity, age, class and place of  origin (2011: 687). Assessing the tenor of critical reactions to Alys’s performance  from Arab and Jewish Israelis, one may conclude that ‘The Green Line’ triggered an  important discussion in the region addressing the need to re-evaluate the issue of  power as it conditions differential mobilities in and around the line. DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   35 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="12"> 36 Migrating borders and moving times Seen through a critical comparativist lens, the intertwined problematics of ambu- latory mobility, memory and power at the Levantine edges of Europe speak just  as eloquently to the Dutch/German border context of Wyler, where, despite the  formal abolition of border controls and the supposedly ‘free’ movement of goods  and people across internal European state boundaries, national capitals manoeuvre  to reinforce their ability to scrutinise and filter movement into and out of national  territory. Such a move is exemplified through recent attempts by the Dutch border  police, or Koeniglichke Marechaussee, to erect sophisticated ‘camera bridges’ along 15  different cross-border passage points between the Netherlands and Germany and  the Netherlands and Belgium (Koch 2012). The new border-monitoring system,  codenamed ‘@migoboras’, shorthand for ‘mobile intervention for better data-gath- ering and security’, is meant to photograph each car entering the territorial space  of the Netherlands. The camera ‘bridge’, to be legal, needs to be situated just a  few metres over the border in Dutch national territory; due to higher sensitivity  over privacy and data protection in Germany, no such apparatus is allowed on the  German side of the border. Data gathered via the ‘@migoboras’ camera system is  sent directly to a Dutch border-control centre, where a so-called ‘producer’ (regis- seur) can, at a glance, identify the type of automobile in question, its country of origin  and its licence-plate number, as well as the identity of the driver and its passengers.  Although under European law sensitivity remains as to how and under what condi- tions data gathered under ‘@migoboras’ can be saved, under a parallel programme  sardonically labelled ‘amigo-boras’, the Dutch Marechaussee have instituted a system  whereby border-crossing data can be saved indefinitely, to be shared with Interpol in  the case of terrorist searches or other instances that might jeopardise national inter- ests (Koch 2012). Dutch moves to tighten the surveillance of its borders have been  matched by current German attempts to claim the right to close down temporarily  its land borders in case of migration pressures from outside the EU, as was the case  with France and Italy in the wake of the large-scale migration flows towards those  lands triggered by the 2011 Arab Spring (Rheinische Post 2012). ‘Walking on the moon’, or hiding in plain sight? Indeed, it is by connecting, in a novel ‘constellation’, the ambulatory flows – migrant  as well as artistic – stemming from the border space of Francis Alys’s flânerie to  my own walk in Wyler that the reconverted Dutch/German border guardhouse  and truck stop acquire the aura of a shared horizon. This horizon is manifested in  the fact that in both contexts – Jerusalem and Wyler – what constitutes the state  border is always shadowed by a largely invisible counterpoint to the mainstream  construction of the modern state: in the case of Jerusalem, the many Arab Israelis  who inhabit Israeli territory, thus making a silent mockery of the Green Line; in  the Dutch/German context, the many Dutch residents who live around the Wyler  ‘ruin’ in Germany, destabilising any notion of an ‘Us’ ‘over here’ and a ‘Them’ ‘over  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   36 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="13">  EU cross-border Passagenwerk 37 1.9 Bicycle track leading across the international border into the Netherlands there’. The horizon effect, linking seemingly disparate border experiences through a  novel critical comparative lens, has profound implications for how we traditionally  perceive and conceive of Europe’s borders, as is already being demonstrated in the  work of scholars of the Global South who argue for ‘new geographies of theory’ in  urban studies that seek to ‘dislocate the center[s]’ of Euro-American knowledge  production on cities (Robinson 2002; Roy 2009). These concerns haunt me as I  continue walking in the direction of the international border between Germany  and the Netherlands. The sun is out; a soft breeze caresses the grass. As there is no  pavement, I amble along a new accessoire, a cycle track, the first sign of Dutch urban  planning (see Figure 1.9). As I step onto the soft crimson shoulder of the Dutch cycle track, I feel I might  be being watched, though no ‘camera bridges’ are in sight, no potential amigos in  my line of vision. Just to be on the safe side, I give a friendly wave in the direction  of the Netherlands (a few cows nod back in my direction). Who has freedom of  mobility to cross this line, unperturbed? And how does walking allow for a differ- ent ‘sense of the border’ (Green 2012) from that of the automobile, one that might  allow for a different kind of aesthetic experience of the border, a different politics  of the border? Critics of Alys, falling in with a long line of detractors that could  easily stretch back to attacks on Benjamin and Aragon, fault the politico-aesthetic  strategy of the flâneur as one that is hopelessly ‘indulgent’ by being ‘merely’ descrip- tive, unable to address the large-scale structural dimensions of modern power nor   capable of thinking strategically as to the nature of social movements that could  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   37 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="14"> 38 Migrating borders and moving times rise to challenge that power. By drawing attention to the ‘repressed’ and ‘hidden’  tactics of the individual at street level navigating the absolute spaces of technocratic  planning (see also de Certeau 1984), the philosopher–flâneur is charged with com- plicity in neoliberal individualisation (Kwon 2002; Scalway 2006) and, ultimately,  political quiescence in the face of hegemonic power whose corruption and domina- tion are enabled precisely by opacity and lack of transparency (Pinder 2011). In partial response to these criticisms, and walking in Aragon’s and Benjamin’s  footsteps through the Wyler borderland, I would like to close with a reflexive  reading of the aesthetic as well as political promise of what we may productively  call the ‘space of hiddenness at/on the border-as-horizon’ (see also Kramsch and  Dimitrovova 2008; for a historicisation of this phenomenon, Kramsch 2012). In  the wake of recent writing that attempts to reappropriate ‘secrecy’ as a strategy for  the Left (Birchall 2011; Phillips 2011), I argue that a streetwise sense of the Wyler  borderland teaches us that under the panoptic anxieties of state capitals there lie  within the border-as-horizon hidden but interconnected ‘worlds’, surprising yet  deeply related singularities that ‘detonate’ our understanding of the border as either  completely deterritorialised ‘flow’ or all-seeing and controlling ‘line’. Significantly,  such a vision of the Wyler horizon is attained not by walking as if one was in the  air or ‘on the moon’, but as a fully corporeal and emotionally sentient observer  immersed in the very material geographies of the border. Nevertheless, the ques- tion is well posed to what extent the observations of the single flâneur can be  mobilised to inform social-scientific theorising. Sharply put, how can the insights of  the flâneur be ‘framed’ socially in such a way as to provide the kind of nomothetic  insights allowing the field of border studies to develop categories that can ‘travel’ in  the service of wider theory-building? We may begin to address this question by stating simply that nomothetic enquiry  has always depended on its obverse, ‘idiographic’ side: the hidden, subterranean  perspective ‘from below’ (some have called this simply ‘fieldwork’). To suggest a  choice between (or even an accentuation of) one epistemic approach over the other  does violence to both. But in this respect I suggest there is more to our flâneur than  meets the proverbial eye. As I hope to have shown through my own flânerie of the  Wyler border-as-horizon, the flâneur is not ‘just’ an idiographic monad, wandering  detached through space. For it is precisely through his ability to connect seemingly  disparate and uncoordinated fragments – temporal fragments of the past and spatial  fragments of the present – that she is in a position to construct relational sympa- thies, aleatory geographies of the Jetztzeit that awaken us into ‘worlds’ of multiply  bordered connections, then and here, there and now. This signifies perhaps the  emergence of a new form of nomothetic enquiry, one that requires a comparative  way of seeing altogether different from that which the traditional social sciences  have long dictated: a ‘decentred’ social-scientific enterprise, at once centred and  de-centred, localised and de-localised, isolated and worldly. This is the ambiguous  space of the flâneur par excellence, whose time might just be coming into its own at  DONNAN 97801526115386 PRINT.indd   38 16/01/2017   11:59 </page> <page sequence="15">  EU cross-border Passagenwerk 39 the dawn of the twenty-first century. By way of the spatial practice of photographic  montage and the ‘botanising on the asphalt’ of the flâneur, Benjamin (1999b: 19)  hoped to produce a new ‘angle of vision’, one that would serve to draw a redemp- tive new border rescuing elements that have the capacity to ‘fan the spark of hope  in the past’, to wrest historical tradition ‘anew ... from a conformism that is about  to overpower it’ (Benjamin 1968: 255). From our ‘hidden’ vantage point on the  Wyler border-as-horizon, out of view of those Dutch ‘bridge cameras’ and German  pontificators of ‘closure’, we can only be inspired to do the same. Acknowledgements The author would like to thank the editors of this volume for incisive but sympa- thetic critiques of an earlier draft of this chapter, which went a long way to making  it a better read. Gratitude is also due to Emilio Cocco, who generously provided  two opportunities to air the ideas expressed here: (‘Liquid Lands, Solid Seas:  The Making of a Region of Mobility in the Adriatic–Ionian Sea’ (COST WG2  Workshop, Istituto Luigi Sturzo, Rome, Italy, 27–28 April 2009) and ‘Remaking  Borders’ (First EastBordNet Conference, Monasterio dei Benedettini, Catania,  Sicily, 20–22 January, 2011). Grazie for both, Emilio. I gratefully acknowledge the  Kleve municipal archive for permission to reproduce Figure 1.4. Notes 1 ‘Schengen’ refers to the agreement which led to the creation of Europe’s borderless  Schengen Area. The treaty was signed on 14 June 1985 between five of the then ten  member states of the European Economic Community (EEC) near the town of Schengen  in Luxembourg. 2 Further productive allusions to walking can be made. In June every year, hundreds  of thousands of tourists flock to the next largest city on the Dutch side of the border,  Nijmegen, to take part in a four-day walkathon known as the Vierdaagse. In recognition  not only of Nijmegen’s Roman past as a military garrison town, but also as tribute to the  Allied forces who died in ‘liberating’ Nijmegen during the Second World War, many  active-duty soldiers from all over the world participate in this event. As can be imagined,  although they maintain an active presence in this border area, German soldiers do not  take part. 3 The interview with Mr Hagemann took place on 24 April 2009. 4 The interview with the Wyler Bratwurst vendor took place on 24 April 2009.
