Technik und Gelassenheit is an attempt to clear that alternative path according to and after Heidegger. Unaware of the extent of "die ?kologische Katastrophe wie das atomare Inferno," Heidegger was too generous to metaphysics and unable to hope that technology itself would be part of the turn from metaphysics. Schirmacher aims to cultivate that very hope, taking up where Heidegger left off, by developing a notion of the unity of Technik and Gelassenheit Like Heidegger, Schirmacher directs his attention to the "undis puted world-interpretation in which contemporary thinking and acting take their stand." Yet there is a far greater urgency and severity in Schirmacher's repudiation of metaphysics. The human world, Schirmacher repeatedly insists, is destroying itself, a world philosophers have shaped far more than they (or Marx) dreamed. Thus Schirmacher translates Heidegger's thinking ("the only alter native to the death of the species") into a project for survival. Modern technology is the framework in which the mere presence of things is made constantly available and replaceable. Significant is not the machinery of technology and its possible breakdown but "the world-posture that made technology actual." That world posture (Weltverhalten) is, largely unawares, impregnated with metaphysical categories of being and time, presence and absence to such an extent that no alternative to them seems even remotely possible. The great danger lies, then, not in immanent catastrophe, but in the fact that this essence of modern technology does not reveal itself as the danger. This Seinsvergessenheit is the positive threat to humanity. Technological breakthroughs or improvements and reforms or even denials in the spirit of mysticism, idealism, positivism, or socialism are no solutions. In fact, they increase the danger and are part of the problem: the human illusion of mastering fate and nature. The same anthropomorphic delusion lies at the base of the dichotomies, hierarchies, and instrumentality of meta physical thinking. Schirmacher's alternative, the technology of living, is an intuitive, tacitly known event, indivisibly encompassing theory and practice, quite distinct from sheer instrumentality (though the latter's hidden truth). This technology, as the event of finite, human living, is most clearly presented in the opening chapter's mostly favorable interpretation of Spinoza's ontological ethics. Spinoza's amor dei intellectualis closely approximates the event of technology (Ereignis Technik) humanly lived, completed in Heidegger's notion of Gelas senheit, that joyful serenity and composure in nature. In this unconventional, but highly rewarding, Heidegger-like reading of Spinoza, all attempts to divide and conquer nature, both within and beyond our bodies, are rejected in favor of a human freedom that defines itself on nature's terms, attempting to view the world as God does and love it so. In the second and third chapters Schirmacher outlines his her meneutical phenomenology and identifies "presence" (Anwesendheit) as the fundamental metaphysical principle. Phenomenology makes it possible to understand the world as an event constituted by</page><page sequence="3">690 JANICE FLOERSCH AND STAFF various human accomplishments (including knowledge, experience of the body, traditions, and so on), in which states of affairs make themselves present. Hermeneutics, the theory of understanding as a conversation, underscores that phenomenological truths are them selves historical happenings, events out of man's control and re quiring absence as well as presence. Phenomenology in turn keeps hermeneutics from the quicksands of texts and traditions, by keeping open to the pull of unheard and invisible phenomena. Dichotomy, hierarchy, and instrumentality, the necessarily suc cessive, dominant categories of being in Greek, Christian, and Modern metaphysics respectively, are elaborated in the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters. This second half of the work considerably weakens its thesis. In general, the discussion merely elaborates and is insufficient to establish that the Greeks "dissolved the unity of the cosmos," that the Christian hierarchy is "an order of violence," and that moderns simply substitute man for God. One striking difficulty is identifying who are the Greeks, Christians, and Moderns Schirmacher has in mind. In the entire discussion of Christian metaphysics, for example, only a single author (Augustine) is mentioned and even his texts are not addressed. Heidegger's off beat readings of philosophers have disturbed scholars but at least he worked with texts in an effort to uncover the intuition that guided the philosopher's thinking. Schirmacher appears to rely mostly on Heidegger for his understanding of these various traditions and the second-hand acquaintance is telling. Even Wirkungsges chichte must still be history and not just effect. Instead of this play history (and admittedly it is less important to Schirmacher what happened or was thought in the past, than how these categories work today) Schirmacher probably would have served his readers better in these chapters by developing their insightful glimpses into science, love and society, and technology in a world turned from metaphysical illusions to its natural fate. The concluding chapter "Lebenstechnik statt Todestechnik," like most of the book, is more critical than positive (views of H. Jonas, F. Vester, and R. zur Lippe are contested) and thus delivers less than it promises; too much Heidegger and not enough Schirmacher. Nevertheless, while at times reckless, repetitive, and romantic, Schirmacher has managed to hammer out an outline of ethical life after Heidegger. In contemporary philosophical prose rarely is such sensitivity to the world's problems so insistently and effectively combined with a conviction of philosophers' complicity and respon sibility. With all its faults, Technik und Gelassenhiet deserves to be read and pondered.?Daniel Dahlstrom, The Catholic University of America.</page></plain_text>
