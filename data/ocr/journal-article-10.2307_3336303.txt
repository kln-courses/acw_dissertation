It is in fact an inaccurate quotation from an opinion given by William Fagg to a London dealer about a head which was formerly in the Pitt Rivers collection-but the head in the sale was a different one, of poorer quality. Yet the Sotheby catalogue gave its provenance as "The Pitt Rivers Museum, Farnham." The compiler of the catalogue claims in a letter to me of July 4th, 1985, that he was given the wrong information. Even so, one expects a reputable auction house like Sotheby's to check the provenance and history of a piece of such pretended importance. I understand that a correction was displayed at the view be- fore the sale, but in a very inconspicuous posi- tion. The piece fetched an all-time record. One cannot help wondering whether it would have done so if it had been correctly catalogued. Caveat emptor. Frank Willett Hunterian Museum, Glasgow BELLIGERENT WOMEN? In this day and age does one really have to explain why it is offensive to be hit with John Povey's reference to "the hysterical ar- rival... in Nairobi of 16,000 mostly bellige- rent women who reduced that city to sham- bles" (First Word, February 1986)? Too bad he was bumped from his hotel room, but it seems remarkably insensitive to be so wrapped up in the big business of African art (to which he devotes his entire column) that he can dismiss the rather more urgent concerns of women from all over the world, including Africa. Eugenia W. Herbert Mount Holyoke College ART OF NORTHEASTERN ZAIRE The American Museum of Natural History is planning a traveling exhibition, to open in 1989, on the arts of the peoples of northeast- ern Zaire. While we will be focusing on the Mangbetu and Azande, we are also interested in objects from the surrounding peoples, in- cluding the Medje, Bangba (Matshaga), Man- gbele, Abarambo, Mamvu, Mayogo, Budu, and Mbuti. The American Museum of Natural History has a very large collection from this area, dat- ing mostly from 1905 to 1915. The exhibition will draw heavily on the Lang-Chapin collec- tion of 1915, which resulted from the mu- seum's Congo Expedition (1909-1915). We are interested in supplementing this material with objects from other collections. Parti- cular areas of concern are anthropomorphic and zoomorphic art, the arts of kingship, and early photographs that document material culture. However, we would like to learn of any pieces from this region, whether in these categories or not. We hope to compile a cur- rent directory of objects that will be of use to researchers. Please send information, and record photographs if possible, to me at the Depart- ment of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY 10024. Enid Schildkrout books Continued from page 24 when analyzing dress, and the essay closes with a brief discussion of written and visual "information sources," their perspectives and biases, mentioning the structuralist grids applied to the topic by Roland Barthes in Sys- teme de la mode (1967). Overall, the essay is a helpful and well-considered, if under- standably by no means exhaustive, introduc- tion to the complex, fascinating, rich subject at hand. I quibble somewhat with the inclusive or at least the nondifferentiated treatment of mas- querade costuming within dress, not be- cause it is not dress but because the mas- querade provides a major conceptual division between dress that reveals, enhances, and projects an individual's persona and dress that conceals and alters a wearer's identity. This distinction is admittedly blurred in some en- sembles (e.g., a Yoruba oba wearing a beaded veil), but it is no less critical to our under- standing of African values in dress systems. The second essay, by Thieme, is entitled "Resource Materials for the Study of African Dress." It is a selective survey of general ref- erences, government publications, bibliog- raphies, theses, periodicals, HRAF (Human Relations Area Files), films, and museum col- lections. Major examples are given within each of these categories, and most standard sources are cited. It closes with a "User's Guide" to this volume. A potential problem in using any bibliogra- phy, of course, is the assumption that its sub- jects are treated fully. The compilers realize this isn't the case here, but a user might, and one could therefore develop a false sense of security. One easy way to clarify what is and what is not included is to list all periodicals indexed. Sophisticated users will then know where else to look. And in the survey of bibliog- raphies, some of those for modern Ghana are cited, but several others are not, and the coverage of other area or country bibliog- raphies is neither wholly systematic nor com- plete. Most users are unaware of absent cita- tions. One enormous category of omissions, however, is apparent and I believe regretta- ble: sources in languages other than English. Since a bibliography is designed as a research tool, it is difficult to understand why the com- pilers limited their book in this manner, ren- dering it quite inadequate for about half the nations of the continent-Mali, Ivory Coast, Gabon, and Zaire, to mention the most ob- vious, for which most literature is written in French. European scholars not infrequently remark on the linguistic insularity and the consequent limitations of American research. "English-only" bibliographies on important global subjects like dress only perpetuate their justifiable criticism and our untenable provinciality. So, while this bibliography can indeed be useful, its compilers might well want to consider a "volume III" that picks up the thousands of important references on dress in French, German, Portuguese and other languages. Herbert M. Cole University of California, Santa Barbara AFRICAN AESTHETICS The Carlo Monzino Collection Susan Mullin Vogel The Center for African Art, New York, 1986. xvii + 228 pp., 140 blw &amp; 148 color photos, map, bibli- ography, index. $39 paper. African Aesthetics catalogues the collection of Carlo Monzino, whose commitment to the arts began at the early age of 21. In his intro- duction we read of his first acquisitions, in- cluding works by Jackson Pollock and Francis Bacon as well as sculptures from Pre- Columbian, Oceanic, and ancient Mediterra- nean cultures. All these beautiful things, he observed, complemented each other, and there was no need to separate them by area. In other words, each object held its own against fine works of art from other traditions. Monzino lived through the exciting years of collecting African art in the 1950s and 1960s. He looks back on it as an adventure, recalling meeting the widow of the great artist and col- lector Jacob Epstein or spending time with Charles Ratton in search of African pieces. His love for the art and the process of acquiring it comes through in the lively and informal, yet moving, introduction, written in Italian. (I thank Laura Lewis Meyer, Research Assistant to the Director of the Saint Louis Art Mu- seum, for her translation.) In presentation African Aesthetics recalls monumental publications of the 1950s such as African Sculpture by Elisofon and Fagg (1958), to which it is identical in size (11" by 13") and format. As in the earlier publication, the arts are presented by culture from West to East Af- rica, beginning with Dogon art. And again, the photographs, in this case by Mario Car- rieri, are a wonderful strength. The straightforward treatment, without the dra- matic use of light, allows us to study the beauty of the works. Background colors high- light patination and details, which are as- tonishingly clear. Overall the photographic resolution is unchallenged. The layout reads easily, with photos conveniently arranged. Many of the works published in the 1958 book reappear here, including the great Dogon hermaphrodite sculpture (Vogel's no. 6, Fagg's no. 14) and several Fang pieces that belonged to Epstein. Additionally a number of works, for instance the Nomoli figure (no. 23) and the Senufo rhythm pounder (no. 18), are remarkably similar to Fagg's selections (nos. 72-73, 96). It is interesting to compare the two books' presentation of the Fang sculp- ture known as the "Black Venus," formerly in the Epstein collection. Both offer four full- length illustrations of the piece. However, whereas in the older publication all four photographs appear on facing pages, in the current work there are different-scaled photos on four successive pages so that one cannot as easily compare the various views of the sculpture. Further, the cropping of some of the plates is annoying. On the whole, how- ever, African Aesthetics presents a visual feast. As with the introductory essay in the 1958 book, this one, by Vogel, establishes an aesthetic theory that may be applied to the fine selections that follow in the catalogue sec- 78</page><page sequence="2">tion. She summoned her vast experience in looking at works of art to write the generous captions for that section, which are actually expert and informative essays. She consis- tently relates objects to the preceding discus- sion of aesthetics, and the information supplied about provenance and, when possi- ble, artistic schools to which the works might be attributed is extremely valuable. Where the provenance of a piece is uncertain (e.g., pl. 135), she presents the choices and allows us to draw our own conclusions. Small black- and-white photographs of thirty-nine other objects appear in the appendix. Although presumably of lesser quality, there are some wonderful works in this section. In Vogel's introductory essay we are told that the works in this volume have been selected for their aesthetic qualities, that is, for their beauty, and that the goal is to con- sider beauty from the perspective of the societies that produced these arts. According to her, the most important objects were those that used precious materials, occupied a focal point in their original setting, or formed part of a large art program; therefore only the best artists were commissioned to pro- duce them. By selecting those that fit one or more of these categories, one can expect to pick the best art from the African perspective. Vogel explains that African art does not de- pict nature, but rather "ideas about reality that are expressed through references to the visible world." It is a plastic manifestation of ideas and values. In addition, it reflects a moral universe in which the beautiful and the good are combined in, as Vogel puts it, the aesthetic form and aesthetic content. Given this moral foundation, its principal subject is the human figure, as it was for the Greeks, whose art also had a moral base. The author cites field studies confirming that the stan- dards of physical beauty for sculpture are the same as those for people. "Firm rounded breasts and buttocks, universally regarded with pleasure, frequently appear in art" (p. xiv). (This statement seems to contradict the earlier observation that African art depicts ideas about nature and not nature itself, a point of confusion I will return to.) Vogel con- cludes that most figure sculpture is proud, dignified, and cool. Composure brings to- gether the ethical and the aesthetic. Illness, deformity, and the defects of age are avoided in the attempt to produce in plastic form the moral and physical ideal. Health, itself a sign of morality, is conveyed in sculpture by a strong neck, a reference to the ability to carry heavy loads. Rounded calfs and prominent pectoral muscles attest to the same ability. Female reproductive power is indicated by figures with full breasts or with babies. Vogel asserts that African art is classical: moderation, the suppression of radical inno- vation and personal expression, guides its creation. Excess is determined within a partic- ular style, and therefore it is relative. She notes that the principle of moderation has seldom been recognized. Generally writers have considered African art to be expres- sionistic, which she defines as exaggerated and distorted in line and color. Vogel con- cludes that since African art does not imitate the visible world it cannot be said to exagger- ate the forms of nature. Yet she later describes a Kongo mask as "starkly-almost violently expressionistic" (p. 160). Finally Vogel asks, "But what does all this tell us about a particular work of art?" She an- swers in summary: formally beautiful works incorporate fineness of finish, evenness, bal- ance, and the cardinal virtue of moderation. (Occasionally, however, artists employ asymmetrical designs and irregularity, break- ing rules to intimidate.) If we apply these aesthetic principles, she explains, our judg- ments usually coincide with the tastes of those for whom the works were created. This essay echoes the findings of Robert Thompson on Yoruba aesthetics, published in the early 1970s. Indeed, the Yoruba termjijora, meaning "meeting in the middle," between the extremes, reminds one of Vogel's princi- ple of moderation as does Thompson's obser- vation that the Yoruba, like the Greeks, favor ephebic figural representation. Vogel reports that the side-blown Kongo horn, mpungi, is rubbed with palm oil to reduce its white-bone brilliance, which otherwise would contrast too greatly with the muted colors of the natural setting (p. 162). This information re- calls Thompson's finding that the color blue is preferred by the Yoruba because it is midway between a shiny and a dark dull color. Vogel quotes Jacob Epstein for his "astute" observation of African art: "It is a great mis- take to lose sight of the naturalism. In much of the work there is great anatomical truth to be found, extremely simplified, and often ex- pressed architecturally." Surprisingly, she re- futes this observation in the following para- graph, claiming that African art seldom por- trays real people or real animals, but rather ideas about reality that are expressed through references to the visible world. This statement is difficult to interpret. Of course, art in gen- eral doesn't completely depict real people or real animals, and where art pretends to, as when Napoleon is portrayed by David or Keith by the contemporary artist Chuck Close, the resulting portrait is nevertheless abstracted and is therefore an idea about real- ity expressed through a reference to the real world. One might side with Epstein and for support enlist the work of Thompson, who in African Art in Motion demonstrates how the human figure in art is articulated in accor- dance with the body in dance motion: it is por- trayed with a certain anatomical truth. Vogel remarks that the combination of the beautiful and good in sculpture compares with the Greek concept kalogagathea (from kalos, the beautiful, and agathea, the good). Again this sounds very much like Thompson or perhaps Bravmann in his catalogue on the Lehmann collection, The Poetry of Form. One must agree with Vogel that strong works of art combine these two attributes. Yet the rela- tionship between the concept of beauty and that of aesthetics is problematic. The two are not always the same. Aesthetics as defined by the Greeks refers to that which is perceived by the senses.

Originally the arts of the Muses were restricted to music, which included history, lyric poetry, comedy, tragedy, dance, erotic and mimic poetry, sub- lime hymns, and astronomy. Visual arts had no place in the museum, the "house of muses." It was Heinrich Winckelmann who made external beauty (visual arts) the aim of aesthetics and synonymous with it. If one turns to other areas of Greek culture, for example myths and. plays, one quickly realizes that moderation and beauty were not the only qualities stressed. Toward the end of the Classic period Plato approached modern conceptions of design in his love of pure geometrical forms. These forms, beautiful in themselves, would be di- rect imitations of eternal forms, not imitations of imitations, as in representational arts. This vision of the arts surfaces in Vogel's essay. Yet in a publication of this importance a little his- toriography would have given some perspec- tive to the subject of aesthetics and the role of this catalogue in African art history. Platonic reasoning has been a major force in shaping our notion of the fine arts and aesthe- tics. It exists in the influential writings of Roger Fry and Clement Greenberg. Lucy Lip- pard's criticism of Greenberg and others in her essays is also worth discussion. Edmond Carpenter suggests that the pri- macy of sight in the Western hierarchy of senses and its projection on the arts of tradi- tional societies has led to major problems in talking about art. Literacy, he believes, has forced man into the realm of the divided senses; the alphabet and all its phonetic de- rivatives have resulted in a one-thing-at-a- time or lineal form of communication. When we apply literary explanation to what appears to us to be formal laws in the art of traditional peoples, we are projecting the sight-oriented approach inspired by written language. Recalling the original Greek defini- tion of the term "aesthetics," meaning that which is perceived by all the senses, we can see the limitations of the written word in translating the aesthetics of a particular Afri- can society. Barry Hallen, like Roger Fry, proposes that traditional societies are "insignificantly crit- ical" or "reflective" in character. He suggests that the reflective response to visual arts may not occur and that any appraisal of it may be found in oral history, stories, and proverbs, not in the discursive explanations, which he calls "meta-explanations," of the an- thropologist or art historian. Arnold Hauser has commented extensively on the effects of art historical thought in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, pointing out that it was derived from a quietis- tic philosophy, an ideology of appeasement that does not recognize social conflict. This view of the world has, according to Hauser, nourished the universal aesthetic. The conception of African society pre- sented in African Aesthetics is skewed; it as- sumes that society is harmonious and that a spirit of cooperation prevails. Moreover the individual is seen to behave in accordance with the standards established by the collec- tive. This certainly explains the moral base of the arts and perhaps the guiding principle of moderation. However, there is the side of Af- rican society that is not harmonious or cooperative, and at times the individual does exceed the societal norms of behavior. These two sides of culture and society establish a dialectic that determines individual personal- ity and, indeed, the shape of history and dynamics of a social group, tribe, and state. This other side is often expressed in oral tradi- tion by excesses in plot and acts of brutality. The less harmonious view of society is also expressed in Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart and more recently in the film Wend Kuuni about the problems and social conflicts in Mossi village life before European contact. This criticism does not deny the value of Vo- gel's interpretation of African art, but rather asks for consideration of the matter from a broader perspective. As William Fagg noted, those who have written about African art from the aesthetic viewpoint "have suc- ceeded only in interposing an opaque screen of largely irrelevant verbiage between it and the student" (Elisofon &amp; Fagg 1958:23). This catalogue is valuable for the quality of the works presented. Vogel's essay, though informative and interesting, is by no means a complete treatment of African aesthetics. One is compensated for this deficiency by the rich information on individual works, the de- tailed data on workshops and particular art- ists, and comparison with pieces in other col- lections. This is Vogel at her best. The book is a necessity for collector and scholar a- like, and to the uninitiated introduces a new world of pleasure. Joihn Nunley The Saint Louis Art Museum THE ART OF PRE-HISPANIC MESOAMERICA An Annotated Bibliography Janet Catherine Berlo Reference Publications in Art History, no. 2. G.K. Hall &amp; Co., Boston, 1985. 272 pp., index. $35 doth. This book is the second volume in a series of annotated bibliographic sources designed for students of "non-Western" arts. As the title makes clear, the focus of the entries is the art made by the pre-conquest inhabitants of Mesoamerica. Anthropological and ar- chaeological studies are not included except insofar as they deal with art objects or art his- torical issues. Compiled and annotated by Janet Berlo, Associate Professor of Art at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, with an accompanying historiographic essay also by Berlo, The Art of Pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica makes a valuable contribution to Mesoamerican studies in gen- eral, and to art history in particular. The au- thor had access to exceptional resource facili- ties: George Kubler's personal library, Yale's Sterling Library, and Dumbarton Oaks. Al- though Berlo does not claim that the bibliog- raphy is exhaustive, her selection of over 1,500 entries (books, collected essays, journal arti- cles, dissertations, catalogues, codices, and conference proceedings) in all relevant lan- guages is both comprehensive and thorough. As she states in her foreword, she aimed for a combination of the most significant, most re- cent, and unusual items, as well as studies that have been under-represented in other reference works. A lot of the omitted titles can be found in standard reference volumes men- tioned in the foreword and the essay. There- fore many of the writings of the early chronic- lers and most early writing on pre-Hispanic manuscripts are not included, the latter being thoroughly documented in the Handbook of Middle American Indians (1972-75). The book is constructed in three parts. The brief essay (24 pp.) reviews major scholarly and popular trends in the study of pre- Hispanic objects treated as art rather than as anthropological or archaeological evidence since 1521. The post-1956 era is treated exten- sively (10 pp.) because that is the period (ac- cording to Berlo and others) when pre- Hispanic art history came of age. The essay contains its own brief bibliography of items not found elsewhere in the book; they are primarily of historical or anthropological interest. More will be said later about the con- tent and thrust of the essay. The second component is the annotated bibliography of 1,533 entries. The annotations are brief, but include such information as general subject matter, types of documenta- tion, quality of illustrations, and whether the title is a facsimile edition. Most entries are not evaluated, though sometimes general com- ments like "definitive contribution" or "use- ful survey work" are offered. Limitations and weaknesses are also occasionally mentioned. One can always think of items that one wishes had been included, and the finite na- ture of a published bibliography causes it to be, in some senses, outdated even before its release. (The most recent entries date from 1983, except for a 1984 article by Esther Pasztory in the bibliography of the essay.) Still, this selection of material is very useful for both the younger and the more established .scholar. There is one title, however, that I would like to have seen included for its his- toriographical importance: Proceedings of the Conference on Studies in Latin American Art held at the Museum of Modern Art in May 1945, under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Latin American Studies of the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Research Council, and the Social Science Re- search Council. Participants included Elizabeth Wilder (who edited the volume), Herbert Spinden, Alfred Kidder, George Ku- bler, Jean Charlot, Holger Cahill, Rene d'Harnoncourt, Miguel Covarrubias, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, Lewis Hanke, Melville J. Herskovits, and Alfred H. Barr. Because this item is not often cited in the literature, it would have been a useful addition. The third component of the work is the sub- ject index, which refers to the numbers given all entries. Berlo has done an excellent job of creating subject categories and cross- referencing; for example, entries cited in her categories for Aztec and Maya sculpture may also appear under the individual sites and monuments.
