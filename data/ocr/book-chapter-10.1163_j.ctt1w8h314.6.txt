<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER ONE CONSTITUENT CONCEPTS 1. Space Since they were conceptualized as human beings, Roman gods had  a place in this world, in which they moved freely. This conclusion is  unavoidable, if  we consider that all Roman gods could be invoked,  and that invocation implied spatial proximity to the invocator.1 Apart  from this, at least the major gods were conceptualized as connected to  speci c locations, normally marked as such by an altar, a temple, or  in some other way. These locations I will call ‘spatial foci’. They are  mostly represented by archaeological remains. However, by relying on  archaeology, we unduly overemphasize the spatiality of  major of cial  divine concepts, which were more likely than private cults to be per- manently conceptualized by speci cally marked space. The sacred landscape of  Rome was complex, time-bound and noto- riously anachronistic. It was complex because its parameters were not  absolute and necessarily recognizable as such. Rather, it was intrinsi- cally relative and existent only within the full semiotic system of  the  topography of  the city. Furthermore, it was time-bound, because the  city itself  developed rapidly, especially during the peak of  urbanization  from ca. 200 B.C.–200 A.D. It was notoriously anachronistic because  the semiotic system underlying it was highly conservative and did  not keep pace with the actual urban development (for instance, the  pomerium was still remembered, when it had long become obsolete in  the imperial period in terms of  urban development; and the festival  of  the Septimontium was still celebrated separately by the communities  that had long since merged into the city of  Rome). It is not always easy to pin down the relation to space of  divine  concepts in so inconsistent and  uid a semiotic environment. The alloca- tion of  speci c space to a divine concept was determined by mutually  1 Scheid 2003a, 147: “The Romans, like the Greeks, accepted the fundamental  principle that the gods lived in the world alongside men and strove with them, in a  civic context, to bring about the common good.” This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of  the CC-BY-NC License.  </page> <page sequence="2"> 12 chapter one  competing factors such as the status and motives of  the founder of  the  cult, the availability of  and historical connection with a speci c place,  the money to be invested, the function of  the god, general religious  restrictions imposed by parameters such as the pomerium and other  regulations of  the augural law, etc. This daunting plethora of  factors  makes it easy to overlook the fact that one element is common to public  cults (and is often adopted in the private sphere too): the architectural  language of  space. For it is scarcely self-evident that the large variety  of  divine concepts in the city was marked by more or less the same  architectural forms, in one way or another already present in the most  important spatial focus of  pagan divine concepts ever created in Rome,  i.e. the temple of  Iuppiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitol.

Given this basic dichotomy,  the actual architectural forms in each category could differ, i.e. each  architectural detail could be modi ed or substituted for another, as long  as the remaining details suf ced to provide the relevant spatial concept  of  either profane or divine architecture. The fact that, architecturally  speaking, the dividing line did not run between individual gods, but  between human beings and gods, explains the public outcry when Cae- sar erected a pediment, characteristic of  divine spatial concepts, over  the façade of  his private residence.3 By doing so, he in fact challenged  this dichotomy, in order to underpin his super-human claims.

Its dominance is due to its lack of  ambiguity: divine space, normally  marked unequivocally by some sort of  architecture, could scarcely be  taken for something else, whereas a statue could always be seen as  mere decoration. The principle of  spatiality is widely applied elsewhere too. The  proximity of  a statue to the spatial focus of  a cult was an indicator of   the degree to which it was intended to serve as an iconographic focus  of  the cult. For instance, Caesar placed an image of  Cleopatra next  to the cult image of  Venus Genetrix, because he wanted to assimilate  his mistress to the goddess.9 In the same vein he placed a statue of   himself  in the temple of  Quirinus (and that meant no doubt next to  the cult image), adding the inscription “to the invincible god”.10 On  the other hand, when Agrippa intended to place a statue of  Augustus  in the newly erected Pantheon in 25 B.C., the emperor rejected the  honour. Agrippa, in turn, set up a statue of  Caesar instead, while stat- ues of  the emperor and himself  were erected in the ante-room of  the  building.11 The message was plain: while Caesar had already gained  divinity and hence was entitled to associate with the gods directly in  the “holiest”, innermost part of  the sanctuary, Augustus and Agrippa  were still human and therefore to be located in the periphery of  the  “holy” center.12 Meanwhile, low-pro le Tiberius accepted the erec- tion of  his statues in temples on the condition that they were placed  not among the cult images of  the gods, but in the temple decoration  (inter ornamenta aedium).13 Fine examples of  the deliberate juxtaposition  of  representations of  historical persons and spatial foci of  a god are  the two altars of  Mercy and Friendship,  anked by statues of  Tiberius  and Seianus, following a senatorial decision in 28 A.D.14 According to  contemporary sources, it was a mark of  restraint that only two bronze   8 Estienne 1997, 96, cf.

Furthermore, the two healing gods were situated not only  outside the pomerium, but virtually next to each other, with the temple  of  Aesculapius separated from the temple of  Apollo by the Tiber.23 But  again, in his stress on the importance of  divine functions concerning  the distribution of  sanctuaries Vitruvius is at least partly contradicted  by Roman evidence.24 Interestingly, Vitruvius regards the city wall—not the pomerium—as  the basic topographical demarcation line.25 His claim is supported by  the fact that cults of  some of  the oldest and most prominent Roman  gods such as Iuppiter Elicius, Ceres, Diana and Iuno Regina26 were  situated outside the pomerium, that is to say, on or next to the Aventine  hill, though inside the city walls (which included the hill as early as  the archaic period).27 Again, one should not overstress the importance  of  the city wall in these contexts, but it would seem only natural that  cults essential to the religious functioning and well-being of  the city  (Iuppiter Elicius, Ceres, Diana) should be situated within the walls, if   only for reasons of  control and protection. * * * The most important god of  Roman public life over the centuries was  undoubtedly Iuppiter. When the Romans conceptualized this divine  form, they conceptualized it as locally bound to a number of  places in  the city. The most important spatial focus of  the cult of  the god was  the temple area on the Capitol. It was not only the size of  the area,  21 Ziolkowski 1992, 266–279, endorsed e.g. by Versluys 2004, 440f.

Epigraphical evidence suggests that Isis was linked to  a speci c place on the Capitoline from the middle of  the  rst century  B.C. at the latest (see below). This Capitoline cult appears to have  been ‘duplicated’ in the so-called Iseum Metellinum.31 It is tempting  to follow Coarelli in suggesting that this Iseum belonged to the  rst  half  of  the  rst century B.C. (rather than to the imperial period, as  commonly suggested) and to regard Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius (cos.  80 B.C., died 64/63 B.C.) as its founder. It was erected, according to  Coarelli, in order to celebrate the military achievements of  Metellus’  father, Metellus Numidicus, in the war against Jugurtha.32 Even if  this  reconstruction of  events is hypothetical, the very characterization of  the  Iseum as Metellinum suggests a political reason, i.e. the (self-) promotion  of  the family of  the Metelli, for its erection. In the same vein, we may  point to the countless doublets of  the Capitoline temple of  Iuppiter  Optimus Maximus in the market places of  Roman colonies at later  times. Their location in the political centre of  their cities was clearly  a means of  political propaganda: were it otherwise, we would wonder  why such Capitolia were only very exceptionally situated away from  the political centres of  the relevant cities.33 Space was also a constituent concept of  ‘unof cial’ gods and their  cults, such as that of  Bacchus at the beginning of  the second century  B.C. Here, it is the Aventine hill that was particularly connected with  the cult of  the god, perhaps originally as an unof cial offshoot of  the  cult of  Liber, who was worshipped there as part of  the Aventine triad  from the beginning of  the  fth century B.C. at the latest. It was in  the vicinity of  the Aventine, i.e. outside the pomerium, that the grove of   Stimula (= Semele), with a shrine (sacrarium) dedicated to the goddess  or her divine son (or possibly both), was located.34 It is telling that con- tentious divine concepts such as that of  Semele could be derived from  of cial gods such as the Aventine triad by the principle of  spatiality, i.e.  by positioning their cultural centre in close local proximity.

On the other hand, the traditional pagan concepts of  space as  constituents of  a ‘god’ had to compete not only with Christianity, but  also with the disintegrative forces of  the spatial markers of  the impe- rial cult. One may doubt whether Christianity would have managed  to eventually triumph over paganism, had it not been assisted by the  dissolving forces of  the imperial cult. The last stage is inaugurated by Constantine and characterized  by a synthesis of  the two competing concepts of  ‘spatialization’ and  ‘non-spatialization’ of  the divine. Constantine realized that the major- ity of  his subjects were still pagans and that the adoption of  and the  emphasis on the concept of  ‘space’ in conceptualizing a divine entity  would facilitate a quicker conversion of  the masses as well as control  of  their ritual activities.

After all, such political  ‘holidays’ could always be politically exploited, either to promote one’s  own cause or to obstruct the plans of  one’s political opponent. The core of  feriae publicae may have been  xed in the sixth century,  although the publication of  a feriale may have been delayed until the end  of  the fourth century B.C.92 One cannot verify to what extent informa- tion that was self-evident to the target group of  the published calendar  (ordinary people as opposed to the aristocratic élite with its priestly  monopoly?) was deliberately omitted. Interestingly, it appears that the  earliest version of  the published feriale was not modeled on the ‘earliest’  reconstructable Roman pantheon, as re ected by those gods that were  represented by the  amines93 or, for that matter, by the names of  months  of  the earliest Roman calendar.94 Furthermore, it seems that the feriale  was not committed to written form immediately after its creation. This  nature, the Feriae Latinae are nowhere mentioned in later calendars as feriae stativae. On  the contrary, in the imperial period they were entirely dissociated from the inaugura- tion of  the consuls, cf. E. Samter, in: RE VI.2 (1909), col. 2214. On the other hand,  the Vinalia (on August 19), clearly connected with viticulture, i.e. heavily dependent on  weather conditions (cf. e.g. the Lex Irnitana from Spain of  the Flavian period, which  regulated the proclamation of  feriae according to the  exible beginning of  the vintage  season, as discussed by Rüpke 1995, 541f.), appear as feriae stativae already in the oldest  Republican calendar (Fasti Antiates Maiores). 92 For a 6th century date cf. Champeaux 1982, 321f.; Coarelli 1983, 185f.; Coarelli  1988, 244f.; for publication dates in the 4th century see Rüpke 1995, 245–274; Scheid  2003a, 54f. 93 The  amines include priests of  gods that are absent in the feriale, either because  the relevant deity had been discarded from the pantheon already, or because certain  festivals were too insigni cant to be mentioned. Flora had a  amen  oralis and a cult  in Rome, despite her absence in the feriale—possibly because her feriae (Floralia) were  conceptivae, cf. Bernstein 1998, 207f. By contrast, the  amen falacer (Varro ling. 5.84; 7.45)  has left no trace anywhere outside the antiquarian literature in Rome. Therefore, the  relevant deity (Falacer) is likely to have disappeared from Rome at a fairly early stage,  presumably before the  nal arrangement of  the feriale. The same holds true of  Palatua:  a  amen palatualis is attested in the sources (Varro 7.45, Fest. 284.2–4 L with Radke 1965,  242), and epigraphically outside Rome (CIL VIII 10500, XI 5031 [pontifex palatualis!],  see Latte 1960, 36 n. 4); it may have disappeared from Rome at a fairly early stage,  since it is not represented in the feriale (unless the goddess was a later import). For the  evidence of  the other  amines see Vanggaard 1988, 24–29. 94 The names of  the last six months (Quintilis—December) derive from numerals,  while the names of  the  rst six months are derived, either from theonyms (e.g. Ianu- arius, Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Iunius), or from a characteristic of  the relevant month  (Februarius, i.e. februare = to purify).

As a matter of  fact,  no Republican god equalled him in the number of  ‘ xed holidays’:  the Poplifugia ( July 5), the Vinalia (April 23 and August 19), the Medi- trinalia (October 11), and possibly also the Regifugium (February 24).116  As to public Games, the ludi Romani in September117 and the ludi plebei  in November were sacred to Iuppiter Optimus Maximus,118 while the  Capitoline Games on October 15 were dedicated to Iuppiter Feretrius.119  The last two, at least, were not only among the oldest Games, but also  the most extended religious events of  the Republican year.

Nevertheless, temporal focalization characterized  the cult of  Isis even in Rome. Turning to imperial worship, we have to bear in mind that the divinity  of  the emperor was modelled on that of  traditional gods. This included  the temporal focalization of  his cult. Indeed, the terminology is telling:  imperial ‘holidays’ were called feriae, just like the ‘holidays’ of  traditional  gods.131 More importantly even, ‘ordinary’ days were declared imperial  holidays, resulting in their ‘day’ character being changed. They were  marked as NP-days, as were the vast majority of  traditionally ‘ xed’  holidays.132 Certain days served eo ipso as temporal foci, for instance the  imperial birthday or the anniversary of  the emperor’s enthronement  (dies imperii ). Thus, Augustus’ birthday (September 23) was declared a  public holiday in 30 B.C. with Games being added later in 8 B.C.133  Consider the festival established on the occasion of  the victory at Actium  in 30 B.C. (September 2), apparently intended to form the beginning  of  a new era.134 Circus Games became the rule on either of  these  occasions and were continued under later emperors too.135 Many more  such imperial ‘holidays’ were established by Augustus and his succes- sors, most of  which were of  a temporary nature, though all served in  varying degrees as temporal foci of  the imperial cult.136 The distribution of  ‘ xed holidays’ in the Republican calendar shows  a remarkable consistency. All ‘ xed holidays’ fell after the Nonae of  a  month (for it was then that they were ‘announced’ by the rex sacrorum).137  129 Degrassi 1963, 449; Malaise 1972a, 229. 130 Degrassi 1963, 494; Malaise 1972a, 229f.

I can offer no explanation, unless we assume that the ludi  Cereris were very different in nature from the other Games.

The Games may have  been conceived as merely political in the  rst place and, when they  were established (in the  fth century?),162 perhaps as ‘opposed’ to the  age-old ludi Romani. An indication in this direction may be the fact that  they were held by the plebeian aediles (whose existence dates back to  the beginning of  the  fth century B.C.);163 and that plebeian families  (under explicit exclusion of  the patricians) invited each other to dinner  during the Games (or possibly on the last day, the Cerialia in the strict  sense).164 One may then speculate that after, or on the occasion of, the  eventual compromise achieved by the Orders in the fourth century, the  Games changed both date and addressee, and were now celebrated in  November by the entire Roman people as ludi plebei, sacred to Iuppiter  (while the old Games of  Ceres were not abolished).

According to this line of  reasoning, the colleges are divided by functions  (auspicia, sacra, war and peace, prophecy etc.), not deities. They may  accuse me of  arbitrarily constructing an early Rome or a pre-Roman  Rome in which all was rational and consistent, implying a steady proc- ess of  centuries of  decline and confusion, as the élite became either  negligent or sceptical or both. I am ready to concede that the initial degree of  focalization of  the   amines cannot be determined accurately. Still, I hold that this degree  must have been considerable, for a number of  reasons. To begin with  terminology, all  amines are determined by an adjective indicating the  divine concept with which they were connected (  amen Dialis, Martialis  etc.). They are the only priestly college endowed with such markers of   focalization. Second, some of  the  amines thus determined were con- nected to very central deities of  the later pantheon (e.g. Iuppiter, Mars).  They ought not therefore to be considered accidental ingredients of  an  existing pantheon, but constituent elements. Third, some minor  amines,  such as the  amen Falacer or the  amen Furrinalis (only Varro ling. 5.84;  7.45 [Ennius]) were connected to gods that had virtually disappeared  from the Roman pantheon already in the Republic. The preservation  of  their names can be explained only on the assumption that these  names concealed meanings relevant to the differentiation among the   amines themselves. Fourth, had the  amines been in charge of  all or a  large number of  cults, the subdivisions of  this group in  amines maiores  (to which the non-patricians never gained access in the Republic) and  minores, and the setting aside of  the  amen Dialis by taboo regulations,  would hardly make sense. It is much more plausible to assume that  these subdivisions are based on a latent divine hierarchy, at the top of   which stood the triad of  Iuppiter, Mars and Quirinus, with Iuppiter  heading the ensemble. One should also bear in mind that as their  name (‘bridge-builders’) suggests the later sacri cial priests par excel- lence, the pontiffs, did not start as religious personnel at all. It is fair to  conclude that the  amines came into being as the sacri cial priests of   speci c gods, or groups of  gods, which were conceptualized as a unity  for some reason. As for inconsistencies, one should bear in mind that  in this book we speak of  personnel foci, whereby focalization implies  emphasis, not exclusiveness. As to the subsequent ‘decline’ and ‘confusion’, these notions are  misleading in so far as they presuppose rigidity and inalterability of   concepts.

By analogy I mean the fact that functional foci can be modi ed or  created on the analogy of  the functional foci of  other gods. Normally,  this process is linked to the full or partial identi cation of  the gods  in question. From the earliest Roman literature, examples abound of   identi cations of  major Roman gods with Greek—later on also with  Egyptian, Syrian and Persian—deities.282 For instance, Iuno’s functional  focus as the Roman goddess of  marriage par excellence was, no doubt,  either created or strongly promoted by her identi cation with Hera  as the spouse of  Iuppiter/Zeus. In poetry, Liber became more or less  exclusively the wine-god after identi cation with Greek Dionysos; and  Mercury, as his name suggests (merx = commodity), was initially a god  of  commerce, before the identi cation with Hermes made him the  god of  arts (‘inventor of  the lyre’) and messenger of  the gods. His  subsequent identi cation with the Egyptian Thot added the notions  of  magic, astrology and writing. 4. By etymology I mean that functional foci were based on real or  imagined etymological links between divine proper names and Latin  appellatives.283 Such a link is most apparent in the case of  dei ed  abstract nouns. For instance, Tellus’ functional sphere is ‘earth’, for  that is what the word means in Latin. But such clear-cut cases are  comparatively rare. Normally, divine proper names are not attested as  self-contained appellatives in the Latin vocabulary. Nevertheless, ancient  scholars such as Varro, or popular wit, never ceased to ‘etymologize’  divine names. Where such etymologies hit the truth, they could, on  occasion, recover functions forgotten in the course of  time. However,  where they did not, a basically irrelevant Latin appellative automatically  led to a new functional focus of  the deity. As a rule, it was not only etymology that determined the functional  focus or foci of  a god. Rather, etymology was supplemented by tradi- tion, readjustment and analogy, as I have mentioned above. Sometimes,  though, divine competence was exclusively determined by etymology.  Modern scholars have dubbed these divine concepts ‘functional gods’,  because they were seemingly named after their functional foci.

Human- shaped representations form the vast majority of  of cial Roman cult  images. Non-anthropomorphic cult objects are few.

With regard to the spear of  Mars, a number of  sources attest explic- itly to its divine nature.380 But apart from the fact that the worship of   such an object would be unique among the of cial cults of  Rome,  the spear was displayed not in a temple, but a profane building, viz.  the Regia.

An  important parameter in this process of  accommodation was the spatial  setting of  the rituals. The performance of  a ritual at a spatial focus  of  a speci c deity meant automatically a privileged (normally the  rst)  position of  the relevant deity in the ritual sequence. * * * Among the various constituent concepts of  the divine, it was rituals  that led to restrictive measures by public authorities, if  these rituals  were felt to threaten law and order. For example, the rituals of  the  cult of  Bacchus were responsible for the famous intervention by public  authorities in 186 B.C. Although Livy, our material witness, is biased  and largely uninformed on points of  detail, he offers valuable evidence  concerning the religious attitude of  an educated representative of  the  Augustan age towards such ‘exotic’ rituals. In Livy’s view, one of  the most striking features of  the cult is its  secrecy.497 This observation is partly con rmed by the Tiriolo decree,  which was issued by the Senate in 186 B.C. to contain the cult. It  pronounced a ban on sacri ces performed ‘in occulto’.498 Livy did not  stop there. He decided to  esh out his informational gaps and thus  to draw an exemplary picture of  an ‘anti-Roman’ cult.

By contrast, Christianity  began as a new cult, abandoning almost from the outset Jewish ritual  foci (clearly in competition and self-demarcation from the latter) and  replacing them, mostly with simple prayer, baptism and the common  meal.517 Its ritual simplicity made Christianity more marketable than  its Jewish ‘competitor’ (and other divine concepts for that matter). It  was easily learnable, and its knowledge could be spread from place to  place by the most uneducated and least well-off. Besides, early Christian  rituals were not the domain of  a speci c priestly group, but were based  on the consensus of  its lay performers. But there was another, negative side, that Christianity was destined  to witness due to its peculiar notion of  rituals. Pagan polytheism could  easily accommodate ritual differences as long as the latter moved inside  the loosely de ned borders of  fas. In stark contrast to this pluralistic  approach, Christian monotheism, calling upon one god and one truth,  could not permit freedom of  action, much less of  ritual. The  erce  controversies fought over issues such as the ritual importance of  baptism,  Easter and the veneration of  icons bear witness to its intrinsic inability  to compromise. The rigid ritual dogmatism of  Christian monotheism  soon led to scores of  ‘heresies’, which took ritual foci of  Christian  ‘orthodoxy’ and developed these in ‘illicit’ directions, for the wheel of   new conceptualizations was not brought to a standstill by the mere  fact that the suspicious theologians had agreed upon an armistice—all  such armistices were temporary. These ‘heresies’ could not be ousted by  theological argument, but only by the sword of  the worldly élite. In the  end, Christianity turned out to be uniquely incapable of  accommodating  ritual differences within its own ranks. Its inability led to a fragmentation  of  the Christian world unthinkable in the age of  heathendom. 517 Cf. Dunn 2007, 55–66. </page> </plain_text>
