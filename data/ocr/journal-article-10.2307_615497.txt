<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS THORKILD JACOBSEN: The treasures of darkness: a history of Mesopotamian religion. ix, 273 pp. New Haven and London : Yale University Press, 1976. $15, ?10.80. The above work is in large measure a recapitulation of theories and interpretations propounded by Jacobsen in earlier writings-- in particular, The intellectual adventure of ancient man (ed. H. Frankfort and others, Chicago, 1946), and those articles on religious topics collected in Toward the image of Tammuz (ed. W. L. Moran, Harvard, 1970). In the latter volume are to be found Jacobsen's analysis of Dumuzi and his cult (pp. 52-71, 73-101; for a critique see B. Alster, Dumuzi's dream, Copenhagen, 1972, 10-12), the proposal to distinguish between ' transitive ' and 'intransitive' deities in the early Sumerian pantheon (pp. 1-15), and the attempt to characterize certain periods of Mesopotamian religious history in terms of key 'metaphors' (pp. 39-46). These and other issues are treated again in the present work (in passages, verbatim), but without the detailed annotation of most of Jacobsen's earlier presentations. In many respects it is hard to judge what reader- ship is envisaged for The treasures of darkness. The Assyriologist will regret the lack of annotation, especially in those many instances in which, without comment, Jacobsen's interpretation departs strikingly from the customary.' The general reader is likely to regret the absence of historical introduction, maps, and glossary, and the fact that refer- ences to texts discussed are usually to cunei- form publications rather than to accessible editions or translations. The sub-title proclaims the book to be 'A history of Mesopotamian religion'. While it is true that the ' history of religion ' may mean different things to scholars in different disci- plines (see, for example, M. Eliade and J. M. Kitagawa (ed.), The history of religions: essays in methodology, Chicago, 1959), Jacobsen's interpretation of the term is singular. He compares the task of the his- torian of religion to that of the literary historian and argues that it is incumbent on both to select for discussion only what the historian judges to be the highest achieve- 1 e.g. the translation of the temple name e.an.na as ' house of the date clusters ' (p. 17) instead of the usual 'house of heaven' (see Falkenstein, Analecta Orientalia, 30, I, 1966, 149 and 156) ; or the novel rendering of iniima ilit awilum, the problematic first line of the Atra-basis myth, as 'When Ilu (i.e. Enlil) was the boss' (p. 117; cf. W. G. Lambert, Atra- hasis, Oxford, 1969, 43; idem, Orientalia, xxxvIII, 4, 1969, 533-8; von Soden, ibid., xxxvIII, 3, 1969, 415-32; idem, ibid., xxxIx, 2, 1970, 311-14; Moran, Biblica, LII, 1, 1971, 53, p. 59, n. 2). ments of the culture under review. The treasures must be separated from the dross. ' For as the historian of literature deals only, or primarily, with the high literary achieve- ments of a period, so the task of the historian of religion must be to present evidence of the highest religious achievement in the data with which he is concerned .... And as the historian of literature is guided throughout by considerations of literary merit, so the historian of religion will be guided by considerations of religious merits ' (p. 4). For Jacobsen, who has been much influenced by Rudolf Otto's Das Heilige, ' religious merit ' consists first and foremost in man's attempt to approach the Numinous and to define it through metaphor (p. 3). His 'history', therefore, consists simply of a series of leading metaphors describing the Numinous, which he assigns to the fourth, third, and second millennia B.C. respectively. In the fourth millennium, the central metaphor through which the divine was viewed was that of fertility (p. 73). These early fertility gods were, he judges, conceived only in ' nonhuman forms' (p. 9; for the contrary arguments see van Dijk, OLZ, LXII, 5-6, 1967, 237-44; idem, RlA, III, 533-4), and they were, in his coinage, ' intransitive ': ' The deity made no demands, did not act, merely came into being, was, and ceased being in and with its characteristic phenomenon' (p. 9). However, by the third millennium divine personality was trans- formed. Deities became both 'transitive' and anthropomorphic (ch. iii-iv), and were worshipped through the 'ruler metaphor' which developed under the influence of the institution of kingship, an office which Jacob- sen holds originated in this era (p. 78). This 'ruler metaphor' persisted into the second millennium in which it was supplemented by the metaphor of' the gods as parents ' (ch. v), resulting from the upsurge of 'personal religion' during this period. The first mil- lennium is relegated to an epilogue, and Jacobsen has little good to say of it. It was an epoch of ' decline and brutalization' (p. 223), indeed of 'rank jungle' (p. 226), with a concomitant blunting of religious sensibility. It failed to yield fresh metaphors. The stereotyped nature of much Meso- potamian religious documentation coupled with the lack of adequate records for certain periods has made it notoriously difficult to trace the historical development of religious ideas and practices within Mesopotamia. The homogeneity of the sources-Jacobsen's re- construction of fourth and third millennium religion is founded principally on Sumerian texts extant in early second millennium copies-renders hazardous the attempt to attribute to different eras concepts from the same corpus of religious texts. Jacobsen is, of course, alert to this danger but considers that his typology of religious evolution outlined above enables him correctly to sift the material</page><page sequence="2">584 REVIEWS into its appropriate historical layers (pp. 19-20). The reader may not always share his confidence, nor the somewhat romantic and evolutionist view of religion from which his typology derives. Jacobsen is inclined to locate the early Sumerians in a spiritual Eden from which later Mesopotamian religion represents a debasement and a falling away. He is prone to regard 'disagreeable' elements as typical only of late, degenerate religion. An unbalanced portrait results. For instance, witchcraft and demonology (constituents of Mesopotamian religion in all its attested phases) are apparently regarded as sympto- matic only of the first millennium, in which there was 'a barbarization of the idea of divinity .... Witchcraft and sorcery were suspected everywhere; demons and evil spirits threatened life unceasingly' (p. 21). Similarly, he elects to view preoccupation with death and the afterlife as truly representative only of this late period in which ' the parlous character of life ... focused interest on death and its powers .. .' (p. 230). His portrait of the early Sumerians is thus idealistic in that he ascribes to them an unim- paired vision of the universe, a primordial union with nature lost to modern man and later Mesopotamians alike; it is also unfortun- ate in that he ascribes to them an inability to distinguish the symbol from the symbolized, and an unreflective mode of perception and action-a portrait reminiscent in some respects of the 'pre-logical mentality' attributed to primitive man by Levy-Bruhl. The Sumerians did not feel the need ' to distinguish as we feel the need to distinguish. To them things are- and so to speak have to be-what they seem, and they evoke immediate, unanalyzed total reactions accordingly' (p. 18). Jacobsen's faith in a distinctive Sumerian rationality has had important repercussions upon his methodology. He contends that in order to comprehend Sumerian religious texts it is necessary to adopt as best we may the Sumerian mentality (as Jacobsen conceives it). As a first step he recommends that we learn to 'recognize occasional similarly unanalyzed total reactions in ourselves' (ibid.). Were Jacobsen simply advocating the desirability of open-mindedness and sensitivity when approaching an ancient religion, few would dissent: in fact, his methodology is far more radical and is open to the ' If I were a horse' critique levelled by Evans-Pritchard against the psychologistic approach to alien religions (Theories of primitive religion, Oxford, 1965, 24, 43, 47). He has elsewhere proposed that the exercise of mystical intuition be made de rigueur in the exegesis of Sumerian myth. 'For our modern inability to understand myth is very largely our inability to " com- mune " with matter and the powers that inform it .... There is, then, truly no other way toward understanding myths either as myths or as literature than the laborious one of trying to recapture the lost unity of the human soul with the universe as matter and phenomenon ...' (Toward the image of Tammuz, 60-1). Would Jacobsen truly recommend this as a safe procedure to anyone lacking his own deep knowledge and experience of Sumerian texts? Jacobsen's imaginative survey of Mesopo- tamian religion will arouse discussion and interest. His book also contains valuable appraisals of many important literary texts, often accompanied by fine translations. Assyriologists will be grateful to have available this stimulating treatment of Mesopotamian religion by a distinguished Sumerologist. T. J. FIRBANK</page></plain_text>
