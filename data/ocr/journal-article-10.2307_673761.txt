<plain_text><page sequence="1">MONKEYS African Species Baboon Films (Genus Papio) One of the major primate behavior film productions has been the series of studies of baboons by Irven DeVore first through Berkeley and later at the Education Devel- opment Center. These films are notable partly because they represent a social psychological approach to primate behavior, but also because they range from highly analytic treatments of filmed field data to simple ethological documents which provide the viewer with glimpses of primate behavior as seen by the field observer and un- manipulated by a film editor with a specific point to make. Due to their wide scope, these films have been given to three reviewers. Paul Bohannon has viewed all the films from the point of view of a social an- thropologist. Peter Marler, an ethologist and primatologist, has reviewed the "edited" films from the biologist's point of view. Finally, Niko Tinbergen has reported on the unnarrated films of "raw" behavior as an ethologist. It is of value to note that Baboon Behavior, Baboon Ecology, and Baboon Social Organization were made as documents of DeVore's first fieldwork on baboons, while the remaining films were made to be integral parts of full-year curricula for pre-college classrooms. All of the films are highly important documents for any teach- ing level.-David A. Horr Baboon Behavior. By I. DEVORE. 1966, 16mm, color, optical sound, 31 minutes. Purchase $300.00, rental $16.00.

Baboon Behavior Baboon Ecology Baboon Social Organization The Baboon Troop Dynamics of Male Dominance in a Baboon Troop Observing Baboons from a Vehicle Evening Activity Animals in Amboseli Older Infant: Four Months to One Year Younger Infant: Birth to Four Months Reviewed by PAUL BOHANNAN Northwestern University For a social anthropologist to review all of DeVore's films is a formidible under- taking. Especially if that anthropologist is an aural instead of a visual type and has great trouble sitting still. Yet, the four or five hours of viewing are very worthwhile as an exercise in looking at the contribution that primatology has to make to social anthro- pology. The films fall into three series: the earliest are those distributed by the Univer- sity of California, the second is a group made for N.S.F. and distributed by Modern Learning Aids, and the third is a group of films, some of them quite specialized, made to go with E.D.C.'s Man, a Course of Study. The first and second were prepared for a general audience, the third specifically for school use. There are thus several things that a non-filmmaker non-primatologist must con- sider in reviewing these films: (1) note the impact of primatology on social anthro- pology, (2) evaluate cinematic documenta- tion for understanding a species, especially its social organization, and (3) discuss the usefulness of such films in education. Primatology and Social Anthropology Perhaps the major development in social anthropology since Morgan-and certainly since the British ethnographies of the 1940s and 1950s-is the turn that physical anthr- opology took toward primatology in the early 1960s. Whether we like it or not, anthropology is a branch of primatology. Indeed, the year 1960 is a fateful year in anthropology. It is the year at which one can pinpoint the acceptance of an ethological approach to primatology-there were Anlagen, obviously, as much as thirty years before, but the early 1960s saw the field mature. It is also the year, or approximately so, that saw the development of the new archaeology-indeed, when archaeology re- joined the ranks of anthropology. And 1960 was the watershed year of colonialism- whatever the mopping up operations or the exigencies of neo-colonialism. A new phase in anthropology crystallized about that time: archaeologists began to realize that there were more cultures open to them than to the ethnologists and that they had the techniques to analyze them much more thoroughly than they had in fact done. Primatologists, watching their monkeys, claimed more or less reverberatingly that they did not understand culture-and the cultural anthropologists realized, as a result, that they still had a great deal to learn about it. At the same time that anthropology is spreading to the study of primates, we are finally beginning to study our own society without guilt and without censure. Anthro- pology is about everybody from the slowest loris to the fastest swinger. All of this allowed us to realize-perhaps for the first</page><page sequence="3">AUDIOVISUALS REVIEWS 1999 time since the 1920s-that anthropology really is unitary. Anthropology is a subject, not just an accidental grouping of sub- disciplines. The most striking thing that anthropolo- gists have learned from the ethologists in general and primatologists in particular is the central place of a dominance hierarchy in any differentiated social organization. Two of DeVore's films deal with baboon domi- nance in some detail. The early one follows lecture format, with a clean-shaven DeVore in a string tie explaining baboon domi- nance-the central hierarchy, the peripheral dominance system-but not grasping (it is obvious today) the importance of the triad as a social principle. He says little or nothing about female dominance hierarchies, and the way they inter-link with male; indeed, he gives the impression that all full-grown males are dominant over all females, but never says so specifically. The newer film-Dynamics of Male Dominance in a Baboon Troop-is much better. The narration describes a central male hierarchy within the overall hierarchy. Baboons can avoid fighting except in the presence of a single indivisible object that all try to get. In the free ranging state, they do not fight over food or over females. One can profitably compare this situation with Evans-Pritchard's Anuak material (1940) or indeed with the War of the Roses. Alliances are again described-males who, in concert, can control the entire hierarchy, although each individual may be low ranking. The examples all show alliances of three. It seems very unlikely that an alliance of two could be made stable or that an alliance of four or more would not polarize and factionalize. This central hierarchy fulfills vital protective and leadership functions for the troop. In order to get pictures of these pro- cesses, DeVore fed the baboons, thus providing the single prize they could struggle for. The struggle for control of the feeding place provided him with most of his footage, but his information comes from wider sources. When you combine this information with that derived from the study of aggres- sion in physiology, psychoanalysis, and political science, it means we are beginning to learn something about agonism. The DeVore films, in showing us the social organization of a primate troop or band, based on dominance hierarchies but without a trace of family (for all that the components of familism are there as they are with all mammals), has made evident the vast importance of structured hierarchy and the unique importance of the family to human beings. Cinematic Documentation Obviously there are at least two reasons for producing films such as these: to provide a data bank and to provide education and entertainment. These films emphasize the latter reason-and I kept wanting more of the first. And I wanted the whole organized differently. The film Evening Activity is the best data film because its compass is small, the camera is still, and it spends some time with a small number of animals who become familiar. For that reason, at some stages of teaching, for some purposes, it may also be the best teaching film. One can only hope that DeVore has catalogued and preserved all his footage. Students of proxemics, as well as of social organization, need that footage if they are going to re-study this material. The forms of documentation, then, are the footage, neat, on the one hand, and the cinematic essay on the other. The filmmaker necessarily is the author of the essay-just as the writer is the author of a book. What is put in and what left out becomes crucial. And essays are, for better or for worse, never dictated merely by the data-but what the author does with his data. It is in the essay aspect that one can fuss with DeVore. Obviously, the diurnal cycle and the life cycle must be explored by any student of animal behavior. Both of these topics were repeated several times in dif- ferent films. But except for the two special- ized films on infancy, neither is gone into in sufficient detail. Watching them in succession (which is, of course, unfair because they were not made at one time or with continuous viewing in mind), the diurnal round and growing up and domi- nance are the three primary themes. None is adequately treated, although there is vast material on each. Is there such a thing as a "contribution" on film that a scholar ignores only at his peril as there are such nodal "choice-point" articles and books? In asking opinions on</page><page sequence="4">2000 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [75,1973] this subject, I have found two candidates: the old Bateson-Mead Bathing Babies and Eibl-Eibesfeldt's films on weasels and polecats. DeVore, with the footage he has, could make at least two. But he has not yet done so. This is the "fault" (if such it be) not only of DeVore but of a discipline that has not yet learned to accommodate the medium of film or make major contributions in it. Use in Education Thus, these are not research films. They report some results of some research, but are not now put together so that much addi- tional research can be done from them. Their primary function is educational and we must judge them on that basis. As educational films, they run from one extreme to another-Animals in Amboseli is a beautiful film of beautiful things- magnificent pictures of elephants tearing up the landscape, lions, gazelles, baboons-- excellent for teaching ecology, especially to youngsters. Older students today probably know these things and will choose to concentrate on the movement of the animals and the sheer physical beauty of Amboseli. At the other extreme are the films about infants-which should be shown to can- didates in psychoanalytic institutes as well as to fifth graders-and the second film on dominance, which is the best "essay" of the group. I cannot leave these films without making some comments on the problem of anthro- pocentrism, because watching them arouses human empathy to an astonishing degree. Anthropomorphism is an error in observa- tion that arises when an organism of (say) nine layers of complexity watches an organ- ism of (say) five layers of complexity. The empathy arises from the layers that they share. However, because the observer "lives" at the "upper" layers and explains things about himself in terms of the upper layers, he tends to describe and explain everything else in terms of the upper layers-instead of his own upper layers explaining the lower layers of both. Therefore, anthropomorph- ism is a situation in which one is not describing behavior, but rather how one feels-arrived at by empathic means. It is the basis of a lot of false projection. It is in some ways comparable with, but very different from, ethnocentrism. The similarity arises from the fact that both are the result of misinterpreted empathy, from inadequate observation of the self as observer. The differences are more subtle, arising from identification rather than empathy. DeVore's films are pioneer film work in a very real sense. We have no other body of visual material comparable to it. It shows the characteristics of pioneer work: tentative at first, improving, not quite sure of its purpose but becoming more so. The challenge that primatology presents to social anthropologists (who must now really get to work on human hierarchies and the problem of power) is equalled by the challenge that the film presents to aural, book-writing' anthropologists (who must really get to work on the problem of a visual data bank).
