<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Stratification of Estonian Folk-Religion OSKAR LOORITS In my work Grundziige des estnischen Volksglaubens (I, 1949; II, 1953, III still in MS) I have given a phenomenological and structural survey of the diverse elements of Estonian folklore without attempting to classify the motifs of each group chronologically. On the basis of this material I shall now try to give an outline of their evolution with frequent reference to the relevant pages or paragraphs in the work that has just been mentioned (cf. ? 259). THE BASIC LAYERS OF ESTONIAN FOLK RELIGION On the material side of religion in the East Baltic area during the so-called Stone Age, I can hardly add anything essential to the results of archaeological research, but on the psychological side I find that popular tradition offers considerable supplementary material. There is no need for us to make the East Baltic area the home of this religion, as the area in the present context would seem to have a differ? ent orientation (? 253).x And here the question of chronology as well as of geography becomes important. The archaeological division into Stone Age and Bronze Age does not correspond to the more impor? tant evolutionary phases of Uralian culture and must therefore be rejected as unsatisfactory. Instead of this division, which is based on foreign patterns, I should prefer the time division proposed by lin? guists, with certain minor corrections. Linguists of course also date by conjecture,2 and my chief amendment here is mainly practical: it is in any case impossible to achieve an adequate dating of cultural periods, and I propose therefore to designate them simply in terms of complete millennia. As a working hypothesis, we may assume that the Uralian period, in space, covers the East European forest-zone and, in time, the so-called Middle Stone Age (Mesolithicum) up to about 3000 b.g. 1 Cf. The Slavonic and East European Review, XXXI, 76, London, 1952, pp. 1?19. 2 Following in the steps of E. N. Setala, Y. H. Toivonen in the Journal de la Societe' Finno- Ugrienne (56:1, Helsinki, 1952, pp. 38-40) conceives the Uralian period as extending to about 3500 B.C., when a ramification takes place; the Finno-Ugrian period lasts from about 3000 to 2500 B.C.; the Permian period until 1500, and the Volga period until 1000 B.C. B. Korompay in Nyclvtudomdnyi Kozleminyek (Budapest, 1954, p. 305) gives a period- table conflating Zsirai, Setala, Molnar, Hajdu, Toivonen, and Lytkin. A purely Marxist periodisation is proposed by A. Vassar and H. Moosberg in the Voprosy Istorii (Moscow, 1950, io, pp. 60-71), viz. from 8000 to 1500 B.C. the period of matriarchy; from 1500 B.C. to a.d. 800 the period of patriarchy; from a.d. 800 to 1200. the territorial-social order (in? dependence from Kiev-Russia!); 1200 to i860 feudalism; i860 to 1940 capitalism, and since 1940 communism.</page><page sequence="2">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 361 whereas the Finno-Ugrian period covers the third millennium B.C. or rather more. Archaeologists may be right in thinking that the Finno- Ugrian seasonal nomads may sometimes have reached the East Baltic area; but we must nevertheless consider the Middle Volga area and its connection with the Arctic, Altaic, and Aryan tribes as the cultural and geographical focus of the Finno-Ugrian period. Furthermore the archaeologists mention the Neolithic Age (3000- 1300 B.C.) and the Bronze Age (1300-500 B.C.) in Estonia. Neither of these periods corresponds to a period in the history of Finno-Ugrian culture, and for that reason linguists and ethnologists have replaced them with the so-called Finno-Ugrian, Permian, and Volga-Finnic periods. On the basis of archaeological finds I am inclined to assume that perhaps there never was an independent Permian period, but that it would be more correct to speak of a Volga-Permian period of the Neolithic Age, or, in other words, of a period of separation of the forest-clearing tribes from one another, which took place during the second millennium B.C., and which can be divided into two and even more foci, if we consider the matter geographically and not chronologically (cf. the separation of the Ob'-Ugrians, ? 253). At that time the ancestors of the Western or Baltic Finns were settling down in the Valday area, gradually clearing it for cultivation, and thus getting further and further away from the more easterly centres on the Oka and the Kama and loosening their ties with them. More? over, it is possible to follow one centre in the East Baltic area archaeo? logically as far back as the Palaeolithic Age, although ethnically it does not seem to have been definitely occupied by the Western Finns until the Bronze Age, i.e. about the first millennium b.c. Thus the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (from c. 1000 b.c. to a.d. 400) can be called the West Finnic period. II THE PROBLEM OF CULTURAL CONTINUITY AND RECESSION Archaeologists have nothing significant to point out concerning the West Finnic period in Estonia; they maintain that the material forms of Estonian culture exhibit a continuity without any essential change. In the history of mentality we can nevertheless discern at the same period, but not before (? 253), positively revolutionary changes: in addition to the monistic principle of the order of things, the dualistic principle thrusts itself into the foreground, the idea of creation becomes predominantly dynamic, the impure corpse be? comes an evil ghost, the conception of a life hereafter acquires entirely new forms on account of the custom of burial in the earth, and the</page><page sequence="3">362 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW idea of the three-world system and even the ideas of animism and manism are to a high degree modernised under the influence of the concept of the breathing soul. These ideological upheavals can probably be explained by cultural relations with the Indo-European tribes. As they have their origin in the Stone Age, they cannot be confined to the East Baltic area, but point perhaps to the Aryans in the East European steppes as their intermediaries (? 253). The Indo-European elements of the Bronze and Iron Ages originate in the East Baltic area and influence first and foremost the Western or Baltic Finns, for instance the burning of corpses, the conception of the underworld, the ghosts, guardian spirits, and giants, the eschatological motifs, and so on (? 254). And even if some of these features reach the East Finnic or Volga tribes (as, for instance, the thunder myths and the agricultural rites) their wes? tern origin can easily be traced. In general however it must be stated that the Western Finns lost their cultural contact with the east during the Bronze Age and have transmitted neither western elements to the east nor eastern elements to the west, in spite of trade and racial kinship. I believe that the most important reason for this phenomenon must have been, on the one hand, a new wave of Indo- European settlers in the East Baltic area and, on the other hand, the geographical separation of the Western Finns from the Volga tribes, and their slow colonising migration to the East Balticum. In other words, we must not underestimate the fact that the immigration of the Western Finns into the East Baltic area during the Bronze Age gave rise to a radical revolution in its cultural standards, viz. to its re-orientation towards the western cultural world. As the net result of our reflections on these historical and cultural problems we can say that the crystallisation of the specifically Estonian culture-scheme was due to four main factors, viz. (1) the Finno-Ugrian forest, winter, and forest-clearing culture; (2) the West-Finnic peasant and village culture; (3) the Germanic coast and sea culture, expressed in the Scandinavian-Viking mentality; and, as the latest factor, (4) the East Baltic servility of historical times, result? ing from subjection with a strong Baltic German and a fainter Chris? tian stamp. From the standpoint of historical psychology it is important too to emphasise the feminine character and the lyrical- contemplative colouring of Estonian national culture: it is not by chance that the handing down of cultural values and of the highly productive national genius has been the mission of women (?? 252, 263). Moreover, the mixture of the so-called East Baltic and Nordic blood, on the one hand, and the combination of forest and coast environment, on the other, have created favourable conditions for the vitality of the Estonians and the Finns: their powerful and peculiar</page><page sequence="4">The Dating of Estonian Culture-strata Chronological Linguistic i.

The achievements of present-day science make possible a more precise dating of concepts and ideas according to the culture periods which have been proposed above. The results are as yet by no means final and will have to be filled in, elaborated, and corrected by later scholarship. Besides, A. C. Blanc (1949) is entirely right in maintain? ing that culture areas are on the whole unstable units, strictly restricted in time.3 That does not diminish however the investigator's interest in the living, unstable, and continuously changing process of cultural change. Any precise picture of past life we most certainly cannot 'reconstruct'; but to try to indicate the main features and fundamental elements of the picture is one of the most fascinating tasks of research. For the present I should like to offer a tentative tabulation of the phases in the development of Estonian folklore. In the text that follows I have marked the words which are linguisti? cally more recent or in any way uncertain with a question mark.4 III THE URALIAN LAYER OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION (FROM THE 6TH TO THE 4TH MILLENNIUM B.C.) In Uralian religion of the Mesolithic Age we observe, besides broadly human concretism (I, 11, 541), vivism (elama I, 22), dyna? mism (? vagi ? 5), and spiritism (?? 121 sq.), the following peculiar features. The idea of animism (I, 540-1) has its roots in the body (? keha) as the dwelling-place of the soul (?? 10-15), m tne name (nimi ?? 61 sq.), and in the shadow soul (ise I, 160) as well as in the separate soul (vaim ? 124). The fact of dying (koolma ?? 18 sqq. and 225) acquires its symbolism, on the one hand, from the surviving corpse (kalm ?? 34 and 23 sqq.; cf. ? kooljas I, 99), from death shadows walk? ing the earth (? 44 and ? hun ? 249) and auras (? kuju ?? 51 sqq., cf. koi-viga II, 401), which are the source of premonitions and delu? sions (?? 170-4), and of other negative influences (? 208), and on that account are dreaded (pelgama, cf. pelg ? 42) and, on the other hand, 3 Paideuma, 3, 1944-9, pp. 100-1. 4 As the fermentation and final shaping of ideas and conceptions takes time, I consider it quite normal that several Uralian religious conceptions acquired their precise expression during the Finno-Ugrian period or even later. In other words, the expression of a concep? tion is sometimes later than the conception itself, and in this connection we must date the conceptions by applying the results of research into the comparative religion of the Uralian and neighbouring tribes. The semasiological interpretation of Uralian words has re? mained far behind their etymological interpretation. A great service in this field has been done by L. Hakulinen. It is possible that there may still be many surprises in store.</page><page sequence="6">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 365 from the transmigration of souls into forest animals (important in hunting), birds, insects, etc. (but not into fish!). The wandering soul (?? 85-90) is endowed with clairvoyance (I, 323), while the migratory birds, as the so-called epiphanies of impure dead souls, serve especi? ally as mediators of the distant dead (?? 91-4, 228). Such wandering souls may be interpreted, in sociological terms, as vestiges of an en? tirely undeveloped totemism. Even trees and stones are regarded as the abodes of power, or of the soul (?? 199-201, 203, 254), and this is proved partly by platform burial (?31) and has led to hewn figures of ancestors (?? 53 and 225; cf. ? kuju ? 51), but not to images of gods in human form. Collecting the bones of game is analogous to human burial, but it is also intended to lead to regeneration by magic. There can hardly be any question of a bear-cult, but rather of bear-burial, which resembled that of people, i.e. imitated it: the bear rites are thus primarily a respectful burial ceremony for those 'half-brothers of human kind' (cf. II, 281, 60, 343). The dead continue their lives somatically on the earth as there is no exactly determinable idea of the beyond (?? 23, 225) the killed at the spot where they died (?? 25, 45-9) and those that died naturally ?in trees, on shelf-boards, or on stones in a hilltop wood (? hiis ?? 225-7); tents for the dead also occur (I, 117 and II, 329 sq.). Inter? course of the dead with the living is a notable fact (?? 227 sq., 238). Provision for the dead (gifts of objects ? 30 and food ?? 20, 22, 248- 252; cf. also expiatory sacrifices ? 203) has led to the cult of ancestors (? 225) and their 'hewn images' (cf. I, 178). As cult-centres we have small sacrificial enclosures (?? 33, 197), wooden sacrificial bowls (including a kind of small basket, cf. ? vakk ? 199), sacrificial huts (II, 329 sq.), or simply a 'cult-stand' of boards on the wall shelf (? lakk ? 249). The act of sacrifice (toiv ?? 61, 194) is considered to be a bind? ing contract between the dead and the living, and extends to gifts to spirits (Maturwesen) whose benevolence and aid are sought, but this does not develop into a symbolical cult of nature. Particularly well known are the fire myths (? 148); but for the so-called fire test we have no direct proof. The Uralian period also sees the beginnings of the anthropomorphism of spirits (I, 540/1) in the same human family- circle (?? 97, 125-8, 167, 263). The impure dead and the elements (for instance, impure water, the mound of earth which has not been appeased by gifts, the wind bringing cold, etc.) induce illnesses, be? cause strange, negatively acting powers gain access to the person (?? 207 sq.). Shamanism, which in certain respects is confined to the whole of the north of Eurasia, is effective in daily life (arbuja II, 379 sq.) and culminates in a state of trance (cf. ? vaimustus I, 504, ? minestus and ? kooma ? 71, uni, unustama 'to sleep, forget' ? 70, dream soul ? 124; cf. also the mating-time of birds I, 362). Also primitive</page><page sequence="7">366 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW magic, pictorial and verbal, witchcraft and sorcery at a distance are practised (cf. ? manama I, 206; puhuma I, 183; soovima II, 478, etc.), more especially hunting sorcery and the ritual cleansing of the hunter-fisherman, also that of the woman after menses and childbirth (? 207, cf. ? 161; also cf. purity of thought ? 68). The conception of taboo is known (cf. ? 67). A characteristic feature is the static conception of the world (I, 416, 446-7), not as a system of three, but as a system of two worlds (maa 'earth' and ? Um 'heaven as a world of light' ?? 98-101; cf. the night firmament as the reflection of the face of the earth ? 106; cf. also astronomy ?? 105 sq. and the Uranie myths ?? 126-8, 253). The separate soul of the shaman and even only a bewitched arrow (nool) with two points can reach both worlds (II, 466). As characteristic is the impersonal and pantheistic conception of the universe (?? 97, 102) without any personified, omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent ruler, which gives evidence of the static state of existence. Death and birth are regarded as changes of life and ordained by the sib soul (II, 458-9)', which also proclaims the ideas of determinism (? 134) and immortality, whereas every thing and individual on earth is mortal (?? 130, 175, 204) and realises its reincarnation by way of the wandering soul and of rebirth (I, 363, 420), and not by becoming a god; the idea of a double (Doppelganger), or companion-spirit (Beg- leitgeist) remains indistinct (??41, 129). Physical and spiritual power are recognised as world principles (I, 589 sq.), together with the male and female principle (cf. I, 369, 378-80; II, 161) and the principle of eternal change in life-rhythm, without beginning or end (I, 348, 461). Nature is divided into elements (cf. II, 207, 387-9, 409). The love of children and nature prevails as the ideal of life; the conception of nature is allocentric; and ethics is monistic and based on the idea of purity (?? 17 sqq., 45, 95; cf. ? 161). The sib organisation is built up on the principle of patriarchy (? 263), and time (? aeg I, 446) is regulated by the solar year (?? 102-4, c^ ? voos ? 251)^ i.e. by the changes of summer and winter. Its background is the collective household of fishermen-hunters with the dog (peni, koer) as the only domestic animal. As a particular characteristic trait I should like to single out the suggestive power of the voice (hddl ? 64; cf. yodling ? 172, ? olletama I, 227 and III, ? 248) and the word (?? 61 sq.). The effect can be posi? tive as well as negative, i.e. it may be used or abused for both charitable and malevolent ends. The voice introduces us however into the mystic world of fantasy, illusion, and imagination, which finds intuitive and inspiring release in intellectual creation, as it still does today. The corresponding expressions were probably shaped during later periods, but the basic idea must be recognised as</page><page sequence="8">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 367 Uralian. Gesture language (cf. sam I, 230) too belongs to the Uralian period. Of special value for the general history of culture is confirmation of the fact that not only the so-called nature myths but the oldest layer of the treasury of Estonian animal and magic folk-tales (there is no conclusive proof about jokes) seems to go back to the Uralian period (? 253): ^e bent for story-telling evidently seems to have been as fascinating as the everlasting quest for truth ad origines, which was at that time expressed by the composition of myths, in which fancy has woven extraordinary tales about genuine occurrences. W. Anderson is entirely right in stating that the folk-tales are not so much an inheritance as a product of culture;5 but the age too of these culture products must not be underestimated. At all events we cannot see the folk-tale with G. von Sydow and others as a culture product of the Indo-Europeans. As has already been mentioned, we find various similar traits in the culture of other national groups, but as a systematic whole we inevit? ably identify them as Uralian. And when we consider how remarkably stable and homogeneous this cultural heritage has been for more than 5,000 years, we must agree with E. Bozzano, who states that the struc? ture of the human soul has hardly changed at all in the course of millennia, that 'magic' among the civilised does not differ funda? mentally from magic among the primitive, and that the impressive array of parapsychological phenomena has always and among all peoples decisively contributed to a solution of the great philosophical and psychological problems of the origin of existence, the survival of the soul, the evolution of the idea of God, and the formation of religion, and still continues to do so.6 But there nevertheless remains a great deal that is puzzling and without a clear solution. This is the case with the idea of transforma? tion, for instance, which we cannot isolate as Uralian (?? 45, 87, 257), although change of shape was well known to the Uralian tellers of tales and corresponds to the metamorphosis of the shaman (cf. the idea of the separate soul). The conception of soul animals may be Uralo-Altaic (cf. ?? 85 sqq.), but we also find here, especially among the Estonians, late motifs which cannot in any way corroborate the ancient idea (?? 77 sq., cf. the disease animals II, 389 and 403-4; cf. also ? mardikas I, 322, and the threefold treatment of animals, birds, and insects II, 322; I, 363). 5 Hessische Blatter fur Volkskunde, 46, 1956, p. 122. 6 E. Bozzano, Ubernaturliche Erscheinungen bei Naturvolkern, 1948, pp. 168, 260.</page><page sequence="9">368 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW IV THE FINNO-UGRIAN LAYER OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION (ABOUT THE 3RD MILLENNIUM B.C.) Characteristic of this period is separation from Arctic neighbours caused by the passing from the seasonal nomadism of the fishermen- hunters to the clearing-agriculture and cattle-breeding of the forest tillers, and the vigorous culture-contacts with the steppe zone. At the beginning the orientation remains Altaic, but towards the end of the 3rd millennium or at the turn of this millennium the first impulses of Aryan mentality (? 253) manifest themselves. The penetration of the Indo-Europeans into the East European steppe has as yet not been determined chronologically and, according to M. Gimbutas (?? 253: 58), cannot have occurred earlier than 2000 B.C. From our point of view it is decisive that the oldest Aryan influences found all the Finno-Ugrians together, in other words they must go back to the Finno-Ugrian culture layer which may have extended into the 2nd millennium B.C. It is true that no precise line can be drawn between the Finno-Ugrian and the ensuing Volga-Permian layer, which means that there was an organic continuation of the traditional scheme of culture during the gradual separation of the tribes from one another. The transition from one millennium to another is here quite imperceptible and indeterminable. From the standpoint of comparative religion we must first of all make an amendment, for faith as a protective power did not emerge only in the Volga-Permian period (cf. uskl, 11), but, according toj. Fazekas, it was Finno-Ugrian (Hungarian hisz 'to believe'). Never? theless the Aryan conception of the breathing soul prevailed in the end (? hing ?? 55-8; cf. lexi ? 55). The Aryans also aroused the initial interest in dualism (?? 25, 40, 56 sqq., 61, 230, 240, 252). Hence the appearance of such conceptions as war (? soda ? 261), subjugation (cf. ori 'slave' &lt; Aryan ? 256), theft (salgama, cf. Livonian salai 'thief'), etc., and hence also the more distinct classification of the dead into two opposite groups. The benevolent and helpful dead of one's own family (toon ?? 237 sqq., kou and ? di ?? 40, 225, 241) become the objects of a manistically tinged cult, and the strange and impure dead (ghosts) gradually acquire the negative power and function of an enemy (koli ?? 39, 225, 240; cf. later di ? 40, mumm ? 240, keremet II, 328-9); and the kind of death (I, 99) decides whether it is a case of a pure or impure dead person (? 25). The Uralian impure dead person is at the same time qualified as malevolent (?? 24 sq.). The Setu Peko- cult (? 156) too goes back to Finno-Ugrian ancestor-worship, as I</page><page sequence="10">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 369 have tried to show elsewhere (II, 109). According to J. Fazekas the West Finnic pekko corresponds to the Hungarian feke 'devil' (cf. fekete 'black') and the Ostyak bakte 'doll'. Death is personified (surm ?? 17 and 219 sq.; cf. ? kool ? 20 and mardus 'death spirit; death omen' ?? 69 and 87). Sickness is conceived as possession (Besessenheit) by strange powers which have gained entry into the body (cf. I, 504) and also as a loss of personal strength (cf. kidunema and kdduma 'to ail, decay'; cf. kidur and ? podur 'ailing'). As the nomadic tent was in part superseded by the wooden hut (koda II, 329 sq., which, as a matter of fact, is an Aryan loan-word) of the forest-clearing culture, ancestor-worship is stabilised and be? comes increasingly localised in the permanent place of abode. If the fishermen-hunters of the forest zone had formerly set out on their hunting expeditions as members of the wider family, the forest- clearing culture now bound them to locally defined social groups of hunting communities. From the Indo-Iranian pastoral nomads of the steppe zone they took over the idea of sharing, e.g. of a piece of meat among the members of a hunting group. This was soon trans? posed to the religious plane as the life-share of the individual during his life (cf. iga I, 565; II, 356, and osa I, 35, 144, 566, again an Aryan loan-word; cf. the verb oskama II, 289). Thus the ancient firmly- rooted determinism was reinforced by the idea that everyone must be content with his share in life. An illustration of this is provided by the unhappy wife, whose mentality of resignation and submission was immortalised by Estonian and Finnish popular poetry a few millen? nia later in moving verse (cf. Section VII). The Indo-Iranians had an outstanding gift for abstract thought (II, 415) and they in? fluenced the Finno-Ugrians in this direction, but not the Samoyeds, because of the greater distance separating them. The Indo-European motif oi a struggle between summer and winter became familiar (cf. the motifs of competition ? 97). Heaven as the world of the dead (?? 56, 100 sq., 229, 241) may at the same time have expressed the first sign of yearning for individual immortality in the other world (? 228). The personification of heaven and thunder in the Black Sea area also first attracted the Finno-Ugrian mind and influenced its idea of world order (cf. the Uralian interpretation of thunder as the soul of a dead person, as fire, or even as a thing II, 7-8; cf. also the euphemistic ? vdlk 'flash of lightning' with Finnish salama), without however developing into the highest god (?? 100, 138). The idea of creation now emerges, while still keeping its ancient interpretation of conception (looma I, 412-13, cf. ?? 97, no, cf. sad and seadma I, 454 and III, ? 253). Together with clearing-agriculture (?porend? 239; cf. toug 'spring' &gt; 'summer corn' &gt; 'race') the nature- cult begins with offerings of vegetation as a kind of tribute (cf. voru</page><page sequence="11">370 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW and hind II, 292). The conception of sanctity is more clearly defined (pitha ?? 33 and 225), and prayer is perhaps already accompanied by burning incense (? palvama &gt; paluma II, 296). The first layer of com? plex magic (noiduma I, 307) deriving from the higher southern cul? tures is deposited (?? 8 and 253). Favoured by the new magic, the sorcerer (ndid?? 71, 221, 224) frees himself from the narrow confines of shamanism, which unconditionally fulfilled its prescribed mission, and desires to act more and more independently and individually (cf. loitsma and lugema I, 228). The state of trance is superseded by the state of intoxication (cf. urm 'blood, bloody wound', Finnish hurmata 'to charm, to bewitch' and ? horn 'tender', Finnish horna 'state of in? toxication' &gt; 'abyss' &gt; 'hell' or 'evil spirit'). The wedding ceremony stabilises itself according to the Aryan pattern and is even today surprisingly similar to what it is in India. To the originally meditative and introvert emotional life the extro? vert yearning is now added (cf. the Aryan loan-word vitia ? 6); later this was more effectively emphasised by the Hungarians rather than by the other tribes, partly on account of various Altaic influences, as might be supposed. In the intellectual sphere such typical conceptions as e.g. mdletama 'to remember' and oppima 'to learn' (II, 289) and iga 'the course of life' (see above) are formulated (cf. the change of mean? ing in the Aryan loan-word arv &gt; am 'value, price, number, sense', the verb arvama 'to count, reckon, mean, think'). The ancient static condition receives its first weak impulses to dynamic action, and this leads to attempts at organising a community (kond ? 263), although the sib organisation still dominates. V THE VOLGA-PERMIAN LAYER OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION (2ND MILLENNIUM B.C.) The evolution and deepening of Aryan influence continue: a heaven that blesses and destroys acquires an increasing significance in the everyday and religious life of the forest-clearing peasantry (junia ? 100). Personification of heaven is carried so far that the heavenly spirit of light and the spirits of air, wind, and weather now separate out as distinct beings (jumal and ilmar I, 400, 451; cf. the verses in I, 583). The thunder spirit of the Black Sea approaches, in the western Volga-Permian group, that of the Baltic tribes (e.g. purgine-paz among the Mordvins). The act of sacrifice is accompanied by decoration of the victim as a mask of power (ehtima I, 376, later developed into 'to decorate'). The great yearly sacrificial festivals of</page><page sequence="12">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 371 the sib begin to crystallise (?? 58, 203, 248-52), while the dead are conceived as bodiless breathing spirits (hinged I, 189). The grove of the dead gains importance as the gathering place of the sib (cf. Estonian has with Zyryan-Votyak lud II, 321), the family spirit emancipates itself from the sib spirit and receives homage in the sacri? ficial hut (cf. the Permian kuala-cult II, 312). The greatest change in belief in the dead however came about during the transition to earth-burial (I, 116-17, 128; cf. the old word kadp in its new meaning 'grave' ?? 34, 230, 240). The coffin made of one tree, which formerly stood in the open air and was conceived as the dwelling-place of the dead person (I, 118), now acquires the func? tion of a means of transport into life on that side of the grave (? 228) and is partly 'buried' in the earth (? matma I, 126-7), not only in the sib or family grove but sometimes, following foreign example, even at home (II, 364; cf. ?? 158 sq.). The dualistic treatment of body and soul is indicated (I, 128 and III, ?? 230, 252). In my earlier researches I considered the snake symbolism of this period to be Permian (I, 339); but in reality it seems to be a later phenomenon peculiar to the so- called Bronze Age (cf. nevertheless I, 362). Linguistically however the following terms date back to this period, viz. those for 'the perished' (virmaline I, 284, 164, and mumm ?? 39, 50, 68, 86 sq., 225, 228, 240), for 'story' or 'folk-tale' (jutt I, 229), for 'community' (Finnish kansa, Estonian kaasa, which have retained their archaic meaning in the wedding songs), and for 'oath' or 'vow' (cf. Finnish vaia I, 199, in its primitive meaning of'spell'). There is a strongly marked trend towards visionariness (lumb ? 48) and music (Finnish s'oida, soittaa; a still earlier expression for this is the Mordvin morams 'to sing'). Even the term for a stringed instrument (Mordvin kafdz, Cheremiss kars, Votyak kirez) now comes into existence. VI THE WEST FINNIC LAYER OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION (FROM ABOUT IOOO B.C. TO A.D. 400) Already in the 2nd millennium B.C. the Western Finns of the Val- day area made their way as forest-clearers towards the Baltic, occu? pied the region of Lake Il'men', and during the 1st millennium b.c. gradually colonised the Eastern Balticum. That meant the final step towards settled life, with the village community as focus and the possession of tilled land, which brings forth the first fine flower of agrarian culture during the Earlier Iron Age (? 252). At the same time we can observe a renewal of contacts with the Arctic Lapps</page><page sequence="13">372 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW (??59, 76, 202, 214, 223, 232; cf. for the history of religion especially II, 475), who even adopt a West Finnic language. More decisive however are the contacts with the Baltic (? 254) and Germanic (? 254-6) peoples, which contribute to the rise of the individual-ego? centric idea of the ruler (Herrscheridee ?? 129, 131, 255 sq.). In con? formity with this the guardian spirit now clearly stands out from among the nature spirits (haldjas ?? 133 sq., hoidja ? 167, varjaja ??41, 255; cf. Finnish pitavd II, 485). Particularly significant in the history of religion is the parallel semantic re-interpretation of the South Estonian jumal (? 136); nevertheless the firmly-rooted sib organisation (?? 131 sq., I, 533-4, II, 167) is retained. Bellefin power yields to bellefin God (?? 137 sq.), but the conception of the highest god is once more misunderstood (taevas I, 397-8 and jumal I, 586), and the Father of Heaven takes over the cosmic system and the power over thedead (??35,137 sq., 230,239, 241),punishing, on the one hand, the evil dead with lightning-flash and thunderbolt (?? 28,139-42) and, on the other hand, assuming the status of a dead person or the ancestor (?? 40, 137, 139; hence the strange re-interpretation of the ancestor both as thunder and as devil (kou and ai I, 151, cf. ?? 256 and 257; about the three layers of the thunder myths, cf. II, 15). The quicken? ing function of thunder (? 143) in the growth of vegetation appears very distinctly here. Vegetation sacrifices come into the foreground {kohl II, 292-4, pidu II, 299, ? 203; for their more precise dating, cf. II, 366), and these are associated with the similar function of sacrifi? cial stones and wells. Finally, the stone-, tree-, and water-cult, under various influences, acquire a special character in the Eastern Balticum (?? I99~*202&gt; 254; cf. also the special virtue of silver as an object of sacrifice ? 235). It may be mentioned, in the present context, that the function of Mother Earth in the agricultural religion of the Estonians is not so classically clear, as it is, for instance, in that of the Carelians (?? 151 and 230). The burial ceremony from vigil (I, 76; cf. Finnish valviaiset; also kddp in its new meaning I, 125-6) to lamentations and drinking-bouts is stabilised within the framework of earth-burial (?? 18-22), although this has a contemporary parallel in fire-burial (?? 35, 74, 239). The greatest change in the religion of the dead however is brought about by the final acceptance of a dualistic conception of the beyond (?? x7&gt; 25&gt; 56 sqq., 69, 225, 230, 241, 252). In other words, this means punishment or reward as satisfaction for life on earth (?? 228 sqq., 237 sqq., cf. 242), associated with the underworld (?? 230 sqq., with a distinct transition to the three-world system) and the spirits of the underworld (maa-alused ?? 233-5), on tne one hand, and with the heavenly world of the dead on the other (I, 127, 397, 587; II, 6; III ?? 229, 241 sqq.). The Germanic megaliths assume the aspect of</page><page sequence="14">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 373 unique burial-grounds (kivi-kangrud I, 129 sq. and 133 sq.), while the abode of the corpse near the home receives the secondary sense of an isolated fortress or even of a prison (I, 117, 128-9). The evil dead person (juudasjmustu I, 140-1, koli ? 39, ai ? 40; cf. vain I, 100) evolves in the North Estonian area into a hostile ghost or revenant (kodu-kaija ? 24), but not among the East Finnic tribes and the Livonians (?241). Not until now does the conflict with the evil dead person (?? 24-8) begin. This would have been impossible to imagine in Uralian conditions, as it is a conflict involving a second death and burial of the corpse backwards (I, 95, 105-9, 117, 119, 291-2; III, ?? 241, 260), even its defilement, to hinder the dead person from returning (cf. I, 490). At the same time the idea of envy emerges (kade ?? 16, 255), and to a less extent those of the Germanic 'Neiding- schaft' (needma ? 255), of vengeance (?? 12, 63, 255), of infanticide (?? 86, 171; cf. liekkib among the Finns) etc., with which the very first contacts with the Germanic peoples poison the West Finnic men? tality. As by-products of Indo-European spiritism (? 121) the demons of disease appear (painaja 'incubus' ?? 209-12, killm-tdbi 'ague' and others ?? 213-16), and even the demon of death is interpreted as an epidemic (e.g. the German loan-word taud II, 455; cf. the change of meaning in kool 'death' into 'pestilence' II, 444). The brighter side of the religion of the dead evolves the ideas of ancestor-worship (toon/ Hel ?? 237-9) parallel to the snake-cult (? 89). The idea of the king? dom of death, on the other hand, remains entirely undeveloped (?? 237 sqq.)- The revolution in the attitude to nature and in outlook on life is profound (?? 95 sq., 129, 131, 167, 199). The impulse to egoistic action is stimulated and spreads. The emergence of giants as nature- moulding beings (?? 113-17) symbolises the transition from the static world-picture to genesis and eschatology (?? 109-12). The rich Germanic water mythology (?? 177 sqq.) is taken over as well as Germanic agrarian rites (?? 7 sq., 53, 151, 153-7, x77&gt; l9l&gt; 252). The thunder- and sun-cult however find a somewhat indistinct expression (?? ^^HS* I?2, 261), but the great solstitial festivals (?? 148, 254) are stabilised. The northern lights are interpreted as the fighting dead (virmalised ?? 75 sq., 254) and the rainbow as a missile instead of as the former oriental symbol of a bridge to the other world (vikerkaar ? 144 and I, 525; cf. the concept of oxen II, 35). Even the pole star is renamed the 'north nail' (pohja-nael I, 386), and the 'world column' is characterised by its dual role as a cosmogonic and as a social symbol (ilma-sammas I, 400-1; cf. the interpretation of Sampo for the Kalevala culture I, 401). In the sphere of magic one feels the gradual decay of shamanism (?? 71, 221), as occidental witchcraft achieves full dominance for the</page><page sequence="15">374 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW first time. This is characterised by a new stratum of clairvoyance (? 206), by the special function of the oracle (II, 379, 381-2), and by the second wave of complex magic (taig I, 41), while the third wave, coming from Germany only within historical times, sets its negative stamp on the genuine Estonian faith in magic (?? 9, 72, 221, 224). The 'gruesome things' (oud-asjad; cf. Finnish onto) of the belief in ghosts multiply. The conception of the whirlwind (tuulis-pad ?? 59 S(l0 1S already West Finnic, also perhaps even that of 'Hexen- schuss' (lumbago) (cf. ?? 214, 222). And the horse-ornament figures now in wood-carving (cf. I, 325). New definitions are given to the conceptions of honour (au ? 63) and of gratitude (tanama I, 228), of the oath and the curse (vanduma, soimama, kimma, siunama I, 206), of promise (tootus I, 205) and healing (tere, tervis, tervitama ?? 5, 63, 137, 193, 207 sq.). The cult of the steam bath (cf. ?? 161-4) and that of the forge are emphasised (? 254). The new structure of the village community brings the village grazier into prominence (II, 112, 208), and grazing at night appears as a new factor (II, 117; cf. in regard to the earlier oxen-culture ? 254). The part played by the village swing (kiila-kiik, see I, 81-2) gains in importance, even the cradle in the home (hall, kaiki, kiik, cf. ? 169) is modernised. Besides original proper names several German names are adopted (cf. Udres, the place-name Utria, Osmi I, 477, 582; II, 399 sqq-)* Several proverbs (vanasonad) and riddles (moistatused) can also be traced to the West Finnic period (cf. I, 185). During the West Finnic period the final incorporation of the Wes? tern Finns in the world of Western culture may be noted. This entailed a long and difficult struggle between the extremes of Uralian and Indo-European mentality, which has lasted these 3,000 years and still explains the dichotomy of the Estonian culture- scheme (?? 36, 254 sqq.). As the colonisation of Finland from the north and west of Estonia took place during the Earlier Iron Age (and probably continued even later), it may be inferred that the Finns brought with them the main elements of North Estonian religion from their former home and then handed them down independently with some distortion from a powerful and one-sided Scandinavian influence. VII THE RECOMPOSITION OF OLD MYTHS In the course of the West Finnic period or, more precisely, of the Earlier Iron Age (500 B.C. to a.d. 400) there appeared a characteris? tic and unique manifestation among the Estonians and Finns and later among the Carelians (I, 323). This was the first flowering of</page><page sequence="16">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 375 folk-song. Poetic composition so intoxicated and hypnotised the individual poets and poetesses of that age, whose names we do not even know, that they built up a vast cultural monument by putting into magnificent verse of great aesthetic value the ancient Uralian and Finno-Ugrian myths, including the entire wedding ceremony, and all this purely from the sheer joy of singing. The verse has been faithfully handed down as an ancient tradition, quite unchanged in content and stylistically only a little the worse for wear, for more than 2,000 years (? 240). The reconstructions of the old myths, labelled 'epic' or 'lyric-epic', constitute the backbone of our treasure of folk- poetry; for they are the pride of the West Finnic poetic genius. More? over they present in themselves a unique source for research into our folk-religion. They have been so extensively dealt with in my in? vestigations for the first time. Apart from the aesthetic pleasure to be derived from self-expression, the prime cause for such verbal creation was an inner impulse, born of the intellect, to transpose the ripened life philosophy and the final, accepted picture of agrarian culture into poetry and thus endow them with a 'canonised' form. On account of the men? tality of the people this yearning could not be expressed in law or dogma, but rather in deeply-felt poetic symbols, which, without any hesitation, we must consider as symptomatic of the presence of the higher creative mind. Of course these songs were not composed by forest-tillers; their authors must have been peasant men and women. It must be emphasised that the Estonians themselves never got so far as the heroic epic, which flowered among the Finns later under Scandinavian influence (?? 255 sq.). In addition to the wedding-songs and children's rhymes mentioned above, the so-called chain-songs (I, 225-6), which have immortalised the typical 'chain-mentality' of their time and not until much later disintegrated into the vagueness of children's rhymes, are among the oldest categories of Estonian folk-song. Originally they symbolised cosmogonic nature myths, for instance, 'The Sea under the Home? stead' (Meri due all, I, 388), 'The Weaving of the Sky', 'The Teardrop from the Cloud' (Taeva kudumine, Pisarpilvest, I, 528-9), or 'The Kid in the Herd' (Kits kile karja, II, 352), as well as the new conception of life and of the world, for instance, 'The Eagle under the Swath' (Kotkas kaare all, ? 242), or 'Gold-burning' (Kulla polemine, ? 261), which are all expressed in profound and beautiful poetry, full of imagery and colour (cf. ?? 95 and 97). The impulse towards sym? bolism is still more strongly reflected in the wedding-songs, as has now been acknowledged by research. We must not forget in this connection that the famous Salme song (? 103) has fulfilled a signifi? cant function for many centuries as a symbolical wedding-song, so that</page><page sequence="17">376 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW it is not to be wondered at that it has shown itself so surprisingly vigorous. A predilection for the mystical and mythical colouring of themes is plainly observable in the Kannel (Zither) song (I, 325 and III, ? 256:14). In the Osmi song shamanistic vestiges have been discerned. But what attracts our attention in this context is the fact that the shamanistically-coloured motif of the separate soul is missing (cf. I, 320), whereas the motif of the wandering soul stands out distinctly (? 85). The revolution in the conception of life and the world can now be noticed everywhere, more especially in the treatment of problems concerning life beyond the grave. It is impossible to imagine from the ancient Uralian point of view the revenge motif oi the singing girl (cf. I, 203-4, and the sold girl, I, 206) or the motifs of slander and con? juration (cf. I, 207-8), which now begin to appear and which became common in Viking times. An exciting combination of wooer motifs with those touching on life beyond the grave is represented by 'The Love-leaf (Leemeleht, I, 202-3). An entirely new way of thinking and of religious belief is exemplified by those peculiar song motifs which paint such a dramatic picture of life beyond the grave as the one we find in the oldest Tooni verses (?? 237-9; cf. the use of dicing to open the grave II, 382; cf. also the motif of the bridge leading to life beyond the grave in 'The Suitor's Drive' ? 228). Something as new in religious conceptions comes out in the protest against the relentlessness of death (II, 455), with which the laments of widows and orphans are associated (I, 370-3, II, 455-6; cf. the laments ??231, 237, 254). The most difficult problem for the Estonian poet-philosophers of that vanished cultural period was the solution of the tragedy of human life and destiny. Ancient determinism had received hard blows from the Germanic belief in destiny, and titanic characters full of energy and initiative were roused to defy destiny in the name of their own will and choice. As early as Viking times there appear abnormal types of cruel ballads (? 239). The general passive and submissive attitude however proved so strong that people, as a rule, submitted to their predestined fate and gave in to resignation. In other words, one had to be content with one's life, even with a too old or .a bad hus? band (or wife), with poverty and social injustice, with suffering and distress. Even misunderstanding on the part of fellow-mortals is softened in humane verses like those in which the daughter finds understanding for her anxiety and distress only in her sister-in-law, a fellow-sufferer, and not in her parents or brothers and sisters. Some of the song types mentioned above may be of later date and may belong to Viking times, which brought the second great flower? ing of Estonian poetry. The third flowering took place in the period</page><page sequence="18">STRATIFICATION OF ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION 377 of serfdom. The three chief layers can be well distinguished not only in content and ideology but in language and style. In analysing these one has to bear in mind a characteristic fact: the same motif in the course of time may be recast two or three times in new versions, as I have been able to establish for the song-cycle about the 'artificial wife', the so-called 'gold woman' (Kuld-naine). As reasons for the recasting of these songs I should like to mention changes in attitude and ideas: the old religious myths and tales of previous millennia are remodelled into the later songs and folk-tales (cf. ? 260), but retain their 'probability' for analytical research. The motifs of sagas and folk-tales in verse will be found in all three volumes of my Grundziige (I, 203, 323-5, 410; IT, 400, and III, ?? 228, 232, 238). Here we meet with a peculiar detail of cultural history: parallel motifs for folk-tales and ballads occur in part also among the Latvians and in Lithuania (in later periods also among the East Slavonic peoples) and bespeak a reciprocal influence. Finally, we must by no means forget that, besides the mythical songs, the lyrical go back to the earlier period of folk-poetry, and also certain work-songs, for instance those associated with harvesting. VIII LOCAL FEATURES IN ESTONIAN FOLK-RELIGION The Middle Iron Age (a.d. 400 to 800) separates the Baltic Finns in their more or less autonomous development. The picture of Viking times and of the period of serfdom has been dealt with (?? 256- 258). There remains only the account of local developments which I shall touch on briefly here, as I have described it in detail in my book. The dependence of the coastal area of the Gulf of Finland on Finnish importations plays a relatively minor part and must not be exaggerated. A later flowering of West Estonian culture, which G. Rank (1949) strongly emphasises, cannot be assessed or de? termined. The contours of the East Estonian highland region, on the other hand, stand out sharply, especially in regard to the Tooni tradition (?? 237 sqq.; cf. arbuja ? 206, lumb ? 48, Kalevi-poeg ??113 sq.). Saaremaa (Oesel) however is regarded as a vital and creative province. But the most important cultural centre for us still remains Virumaa (not within its present administrative boundaries, but as a larger unit); because it is from here that the ancient Germanic elements have radiated (first and foremost kalev, haldjas, joul, kivi- kangrud as burial places, all-ilm, maa-ahsed, kodu-kaija, dike, later on even tout and others), and from here the connection with the Vodians and other related tribes beyond the Narva and the Neva (Nova) has been maintained. Virumaa has the honour of having created and</page><page sequence="19">378 THE SLAVONIC review handed down the lion's share of the Estonian treasure of folk-song. In the course of my work I have had to emphasise the notable differences between the north and the south of Estonia (cf. I, 552, 558, 582; II, 179, 191, 236-7). The chief reason for this is that in the past the Germanic peoples settled in the north, whereas the south of Estonia had a more Baltic orientation and has retained many special features. But south-west and south-east Estonia must also be distinctly separated. Mulgimaa was the original focus of early Estonian culture (? 252) and, together with the Livonian Dvina (Vaina) area, has radiated the Baltic elements (juudas I, 140). Voru-Setumaa (in old times Ugandi &gt; Oandi), on the other hand, was the centre of radiation for the East Slavonic elements, so much so that its speech knows nothing of the Germanic kalev, haldjas,joul, etc. And the Setu giant motifs, for instance, are important evidence of Russo-Varangian influence from a cultural and historical point of view (? 117).</page></plain_text>
