<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS The Nature of Deity : a Sequel to " Personality and Reality." By J. E. Turner, M.A., Ph.D., Reader in Philosophy in the University of Liverpool. (London : George Alien &amp; Unwin, Ltd. 1927. Pp. 248. Price 10s.) Dr. Turner is to be commended for treating a subject that lends itself only too easily to rhetoric with austerity and restraint. Holding that " all knowledge without exception inevitably expands into belief " (p. 14), that " any uncompromising and absolute agnosticism contradicts the essential tendency of intellectual evolution " (ib.), and that beliefs are legitimate, not (as William James contended) in spite of, but only when grounded upon, logical reasoning, his appeal from first to last is to the intellect. This is why he rules out at the start (p. 17) the evidence to be derived from mystic intuition, immediate experience of God, and divine revelation; not from any desire to disparage its significance, but because it is " too personal, too individualist and dogmatic, never sufficiently rational or logical." He sternly resists the temptation to indulge in literary embellishment or to pander, in his exposition of Theism, to the religious sentiment of the reader. Rather is he apt to err in the opposite direction, and to express his thought with a frigidity and lack of imagination that make it diffieult at times to keep the attention fixed upon the argument. In his effort to be logical, he often only succeeds in being abstract; the array of cumbrous phrases tending more to obscurity than to enlightenment. For example, discussing the analogy between the increased control over mechanical inventions that comes with growth of human knowledge and God's relation, by way of transcendence and immanence, to physical nature, he writes (pp. 69, 70) :? " Regarded in the first place solely in the light of its activity, highly automatic mechanism is transcended by the originative mind ; while in the light of its extreme intricacy and delicacy of structure on the other hand?that is its nature as distinguished from its activity, or its consti- tution as distinct from its function?the capacity of the originative mind is revealed, expressed, and in that sense immanent in such mechanism. Apply- ing this principle, which plainly governs all man's individual and social experience, to the Supreme Self, it implies that Deity is both immanent throughout the material universe, so far as its infinitely complex nature is concerned, and at the same time absolutely transcendent of that universe so far as its perfectly automatic activity is concerned, although this activity is plainly the direct outcome of its nature." The point here is an interesting one ; but the language?especially the use of the possessive " its " (Lord Castlereagh once ended a speech in the House of Commons with this word) is bewildering; nor is the quotation a unique specimen of the author's style. But the book, for all this, is a pains- taking endeavour to determine, especially in the light of analogies drawn from human experience, the salient characteristics of Deity. It is constructive in aim and method ; the argument is, in large measure, convincing, and, even where it fails to carry conviction, deserves serious consideration. As the sequel to Dr. Turner's previous book on Personality and Reality, 392</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS this volume presupposes, amid much else, the argument there presented to the existence of God as the Supreme Self within the Universe. By the " Universe," Dr. Turner means the all-inclusive whole of Reality. God, therefore, is not the Absolute, but One among other reals; a view that goes far to mitigate the difficulty of interpreting His nature as that of a Self, on the analogy of human selves. To discuss this problem?by far the most interesting and important of any raised by Dr. Turner?would carry us beyond the scope of the present notice. But we cannot help re- gretting that a work treating of matters of such high moment should require to be supplemented, at almost every crucial point, by reference to other writings of the author. It is tantalizing, for instance, when we approach the subject of Creation, to find the distinction between Deity and the rest of the universe represented as a " self-distinction " (pp. 35, 86), and yet to be told of " the primal action of the Supreme Self upon the material universe " (p. 123), without a fuller elucidation of the riddle than is here forthcoming. In his opening chapters Dr. Turner argues in some detail that God, while existentially distinct from other reals, is by virtue of His dynamic activity absolutely dominant; so that His " functional infinity overrides this finitude of distinction with which it co-exists " (p. 85). This is Dr. Turner's way of expressing what the great doctors of the thirteenth century meant when, building on the newly discovered inheritance of Aristotle, they declared that Being could not be asserted univocally of God and of His creatures. We have no quarrel with the novel rendering given to this principle ; nor with Dr. Turner's reliance on the via analogica, which the same mediaeval thinkers used to such fine issues. If once we assume that God is a self, His Personality is obviously, for Dr. Turner as for Lotze, an ideal Personality; and human personality, especially on its higher planes of development, can be called into play to throw light on its exemplar. Here Dr. Turner is at his best. He shows with ample illustration how human knowledge in its advance is inseparably associated with human power, how, both in form and content, it points forward to its natural consummation in intuitive omniscience, and how omniscience carries with it an omnipotence which, so far from being arbitrary, is the perfect expression of rational law. So likewise is it with human purpose. Purpose " intends the perfect and means the removal of imperfection " ; ineffectiveness is no more inherent in the nature of purpose than is error in the nature of knowledge ; therefore " perfect purpose implies and demands equally perfect realization " (pp. 84 ff.). The purpose of Deity is defined (p. 120) as " the existence of reals capable of becoming more and more akin to Himself " ; and this involves the attribute of Love in God towards His creatures, as a sustaining and unifying power, such as that which binds the great thinker to his little child or leads the artist to devote himself with ungrudging affection to the minutest details of his work (Chapter VI). Finally (Chapter VII), the unitary nature of these Attributes (Omniscience, Omnipotence, Purpose, Love) finds expres? sion in the term " Holiness," taken not merely in its ethical and religious bearings, but to signify the " wholeness " of the divine nature ; a " holiness " which, by virtue of God's functional immanence, is reflected at every stage in the process of the world's development. Dr. Turner makes some pertinent criticisms at this point on Professor Otto's well-known book; pro testing, in our opinion justly, against the limitation of the term " rational" to the field of conceptual thinking, and the identification of Deity with the " wholly other," in the sense of an absolutely transcendent mystery. Dr. Turner is at pains to discriminate between his own vindication of God's transcendence and the position of those who affirm it so rigorously as to exclude the possi- 393</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES bility of His immanence. In maintaining the continuity between human and divine personality, he guards carefully against anthropomorphism, allowing that the gulf between God's Attributes and their analoga in man is one not merely of degree but of kind. Within our experience we find everywhere that development implies transformation. Nor is he prepared to rule out as inconceivable Spinoza's claim that God possesses characters other than those known to the human mind. But he holds firmly to the position that the nature of Deity in general, though not in its detailed con? tent, is knowable by man; and exposes forcibly Spinoza's inconsistency in maintaining at once (a) that God's intellect differs from ours in everything but in name, and (b) that man " can form an adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain of God's attributes." Dr. Turner's argument is conducted throughout on the empirical method. His appeal is to " the known features of real being " rather than to theoretical suggestion or hypothesis. He thinks (p. 14) that " abstract theory and speculation have occupied somewhat too prominent a place in previous analyses of the present problem." The full bearing of this position is made clear in an admirable passage in the second chapter, where he insists on the error of divorcing the a priori in knowledge from the a posteriori. As Bosan? quet was so fond of pointing out, the former develops continuously from the latter, " crystallizing out from the a posteriori as the result of a progressive transformation. So also intuitive thinking emerges from discursive. Dr. Turner is therefore bound to consider very seriously those facts of experience which weigh most heavily against his argument, and, in particular, the facts of suffering and evil. He discusses this problem in Chapter IV (Divine Purpose : Pain and Evil), Chapter IX (Man and Deity ; Evil and Atonemeni), and in many other places up and down the volume. He rightly considers that moral evil is the most serious factor in the problem, and has much to say that is good on the inherently self-destructive nature of evil. " Not only is all evil self-destructive, but its annihilation is due always to the activity of good, while at the same time this continuous victory itself increases and heightens the good. . . . Neither good nor evil is ever passive, but essentially active and dynamic; and it is rarely?only perhaps ih its final stages?that the latter vanishes imperceptibly" (pp. 110-111). Yet we are left with the impression that Dr. Turner is too facile in his optimism. Is it the case that, "within" human experience, the expanding control of mind over its environment results in the slow elimination of pain as such? that is, apart from its connection with effort and sacrifice " (p. 102) ? It is surely as true that " he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow," and that disease and sin become more prevalent with advance in the scale of civilization. When we are told, again, of " the intimate connection between real happiness and the good," what, we ask, is meant by " real " ? That goodness brings with it a peace of mind that passeth understanding is un- deniable; but what has this to do with the mystery of pain ? As Kant well knew, there is no analytic or synthetic connection between happiness and virtue within the confines of our temporal experience. Once more, we read (p. 230) that " humanity is forced to realize that evil, to say the least, ' does not pay'?that honesty, whatever else it implies, is at any rate the best policy." This may be so in the small concerns of life, thanks to the organization of civilized society; but what about evil on the grand, Napoleonic scale ? This was the problem that vexed so persistently the soul of Plato ; and when he answered it, it was not by an appeal to human experience but by the confession of a rational faith in the transcendent good. Dr. Turner snares this faith, and, like Plato, is convinced that it is rational; 394</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS but he is too prone to forget that, apart from such a faith, the facts of experi? ence fail to furnish a clear solution. We have only been able to call attention to a few of the topics handled by Dr. Turner in this book. Its defects are patent on the surface. Over and above those already mentioned, there are the frequent repetition of previous statements, as though they were pontifical pronouncements, and a certain measure of complacency, exemplified in the not very successful attempt to answer Professor Laird's strictures on the earlier volume. Dr. Turner takes himself, as well as his theme, very seriously. The Index, too, is in? adequate. Yet, despite these blemishes, the work has positive merits, and is bound, in view of the writer's honest effort to reason out his problem, to evoke interest in the thinking public. W.
