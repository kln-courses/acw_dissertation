<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LORD OF CAITLE IN GILAiN GARNIK ASATRIAN (Yerevan State Universit) In Memory ofJes P. Asmussen, Scholar and Friend The folk beliefs of many Iranian peoples, particularly those culturally populating the most conservative Near Caspian area,' abound in very archaic elements dating back from the pre-Islamic time. The multi-century official religious doctrine could never expel the "vital" figures in the pantheons of the cattle-breeding communities, primarily the deities and patrons of animality. Protected from oblivion by the stability of the religious substrate, along with the centuries-old invariable type of economic activity of livestock rising, these characters were sealed into an unprecedented longevity. Through the myths of the Southern and Western Caspian waterside peoples (mostly Gilanis, also the Talishis and the Mazandaranis), the image has been delivered to us of Siyah-gales, the chief master and guard of animals, and cows in particular. The Talishis, for example, according to 'Ali 'Abdoli, see Siyah-gales always escorting the grazing cattle, and punishing some disobedient animals hurting other cows or giving trouble to shepherds. Siyah-gale' penalises the delinquent cow by knocking her horns in the ground so that her legs remain sticking in the air. To encourage the diligent shepherds or anyone who pleases him by good treatment of cows, Siyah-gales awards a little rope causing luck in business and facilitating surplus stock. Among the eastern Talishis Shi'ites the role of Siyah-gales is performed by Khidir Nabi (Xizr)2 embracing the functions of three Christian saints: St. George, St. Elias (Elijah) and St. Sergius.3 The prominent Iranian writer Sadeq Hedayat describes Siyah- gales as a savage unsociable herdsman, who grazes a herd of wild cows in the locality carrying his name. Those who dare to go hunting in this reserve, where animals are never to be harmed, will be stricken by punishment from Siyah-gales: they are persecuted I This fact was even noted by the early Muslim historiographers, cf. K. A. 1IHoCTpaHLTeB, CacaHwk,o;ue antloob, CH6, 1909: 110-135. 2 See 'All 'AbdolT, Talegihjff kstand?, Tehran, 1991:189-190. 3 A. A.

From time to time Siyah-gales goes in the shape of an old man to the Friday market to sell butter. One who is lucky enough to buy butter from him will find that it will never end, as long as the buyer keeps mum.4 It is remarkable that this was practically the only mention of Siyah-gales in the relevant literature (except the above-mentioned short note from the recently published book of 'Abdoli5) quoted by all subsequent authors addressing this subject.6 The black herdsman has actually been so far highlighted only by the brief descriptons of Hedayat and 'Abdoli providing a rather general picture of him, no doubt, as a key figure of the folk pantheon of the littoral Caspian population. The recently published article by V. Arakelova7 actually does nothing to reveal any additional data on this cattle deity. In the course of a recent expedition to Gilan, starting from Ardabil via the pass of Heyran and the Persian Astara, then Lavandvil, Talish, Enzeli, Rasht and Masule, and so on, we managed, inter alia, to collect new, although still not very complete, data on Siyah-gales, adding a great deal to his folk image that is currently at our disposal. While gathering the materials in the field we were invaluably assisted by Mohammad Boshra, a well-known Gilani poet, folklore researcher and local pundit, who was so kind that he provided us with the dossier of Siyah-gales from his unpublished materials on the popular beliefs of Gilan. All we have at present on Siyah-gales unambiguously shows that he is a patron-deity of animals, primarily domestic ones, cows, sheep and goats, as well as those wild ones that are edible (halI- gi29t, that is, deer, wild goats, gazelles, and even birds. Everywhere in Gilan and Mazandaran, Siyah-ga1es is imagined as an invisible herdsman, an old man clad in black wool or hides, stick in hand, the symbol of herdsmanship, or as a large, tall, dark- faced young man. He is accompanied by a large deer with spreading antlers, which he is rumoured to favour very much. Siyah-gales himself can appear as a deer or a gazelle as well.

Arakelova, "Siyah-gales-the Black Shepherd", Iran and the Caucasus, vol. 1 (1997): 121-125.</page><page sequence="3">THE LORD OF CATTLE IN GILAN 77 The patronage shown by Siyah-gales towards good-tempered herdsmen and people with pure hearts is manifested by surplus stock, better milk yield, success and prosperity of their household. He may award a pious herdsman a small flock of sheep or goats, which will be sure to grow. However, clear intentions and good temper are yet insufficient to win the patronage of the deity. One has to observe special rules of running the cattle-breeding facilities: to maintain the barn and the cow house in cleanliness, the cattle-breeding implements and the animals, to care for them properly, particularly for the pregnant animals and the young stock, and to refrain from beating and cruel treatment of animals. Moreover, one should not sell or carry milk or dairy produce out of home at night. Around the areas of Deylaman and Siyahkal they also think that drinking milk at night may anger Siyah-gales, so one should refrain from this. Particularly scrupulous attention and care are demanded by the cows, traditionally considered to be in the favour of Siyah-gales. Since Siyah-gales also patronises wild animals, the hunters, too, have to observe special rules of hunting, lest the deity should be displeased. It is permitted to hunt with the exclusive purpose of feeding the family and to display no superfluous greed, since for each hunter the industry has- strict limitations monitored watchfully by Siyah-gales. In other words, each hunter, with regard to his wealth, capabilities and moral status, is assigned a restricted number of animals from each species to kill. Violation of the quota will entail the anger of the Black Herdsman, which can be manifested in inflicting damage upon the trespasser, down to his destruction. When a hunter is lost in the forest or will perish for any reason, he is considered to have violated the bans imposed by Siyah-gales. However, prior to sanctioning, the deity will make a warning to the infract or: his weapon may be deflected from its aim by a perching bird, difficulties and interference may arise on his way, such as his weapons becoming inoperative, and so on. If, however, a poor and righteous hunter is compelled to go on hunting despite the ban, Siyah-g31es may himself assist him by offering a large deer with its meat never ending, unless the hunter reveals the secret miracle. Not everyone is lucky enough to encounter Siyah-gales, but if anyone identifies the deity in an old man, a young man or an animal, or if the latter himself confronts anyone, then the life of this person will radically change so that welfare (barakat,</page><page sequence="4">78 GARNIKASATRIAN happiness and success will attend him at all times if he keeps the meeting secret. The good hunters or shepherds are also awarded by Siyah-gales with a magic egg or piece of meat to be added to a bag of rice or a pan of meal (ab-gst) respectively, so that the rice or meat broth should never end, but only in the case that they remain silent forever about the miracle. The good shepherds are sometmes awarded by Siyah-gales a magic black rope, using which they can tame or restrain the uncontrollable beasts. The same rope will stipulate surplus stock. Siyah-gales helps those who get into trouble, particularly the shepherds who get into a blizzard, snowfall, and so on. However, in such cases he always takes away the best cow from the herd when leaving. Siyah-gales is not only a patron of animals; he is also their true master, ruling them and guarding them. If needed, he will rnilk the cattle; he is particularly mindful of the pregnant animals helping them during birth. That is why the people call him "the obstetrician of cows" (maina-ye gavan). This is the reason why it is not advisable to approach the cow when she is giving birth, lest Siyah-gales should be hindered from helping her during delivery. Herdsmen are wary of verbally abusing the animals, thinking that in revenge Siyah-gales will punish them (i.e. animals) for having disgraced him as their true master. If some animal drops behind by night and gets lost in the forest, then if the master cannot find it, he tries to keep mum lest Siyah-gales should know and punish the beast. Meanwhile, however, they pray quietly to Siyah-gales, asking him to protect and help the lost animal. Overall, the object of disciplining the animals, both wild and domestic, occupies a conspicuous place in the folk conception of Siyah-gales. For example, if a cow while milking is disobedient or aggressive, reluctantly giving away milk, she may incur the anger of Siyah-gales and his punishment, which takes the form either of disease or of some other curse: her head or tail, for example, may be stuck among branches or split parts of a tree, she may fall off a cliff, stick her horns in the ground and remain in that position. The popular term for the punishment of Siyah-gales is siysh-glesi- zadegi that is, a strike by Siyah-gales. Exemption from calamity will occur only after the period appointed by Siyah-gales for a particular punishment expires (commonly it is said to last three days), and no one can save the animal before that time, for during that period it will not be visible to human eyes. Only a very</page><page sequence="5">THE LORD OF CATTE IN GILAN 79 righteous man can occasionally come across the animal during the chastisement and save it. As to the disease sent by Siyah-gales to cows, it is like epilepsy in people. Incidentally, some of the informants thought that Siyah-gales was only the name of a cow disease, exactly like the female demon Al, which is sometimes regarded as the name of a women's disease.8 Beside the so-called long-term punishments provided for serious injunctions, Siyah-gales may punish an animal by inflicting an easier penalty, such as a slight injury. However, the preferable punishment used by Siyah-gales with regard to the delinquent cows is tangling their legs in the ropes to which they are tied in pasture, making them fall on their back. It is thought that Siyah- gales does this by approaching the cow and scaring her. In such cases the master has to use an iron tool, principally a knife, to draw a line around the cow, to pour water on her head, cover the snout with a kerchief, read a prayer, and then only to cut the rope entangling the animal's legs. To avoid similar cases, when tying up a cow, one has to pass the hand over her head, mention God and draw a line around her with a knife. A protective effect against Siyah-gales is also achieved by a wreath in the form of a horseshoe made of the twigs of nettle tree called in Gilan tfrdane (Celtis L.), to be hung on the cow's forehead. The folk idea is that whatever is made of this tree has an apotropaic effect against evil spirits and those hideous things. It is to be noted that in the folk imagination the topic of sanctions with regard to small cattle has not been recorded, although those animals do originally belong to Siyah-gales and are placed under his patronage too. Instead Siyah-gales is rather severe with regard to wild animals: for certain misdeeds they are run down by the anger of the Black Herdsman, and they are shot by the hunters. Therefore, any wild animal which has fallen victim to the hunter carries a curse by the deity. In the meantime, when cursing a delinquent deer, gazelle or wild goat, Siyah-gales will predict their death from a particular hunter: "Let the arrow of such-and-such hunter run you down", he says (E1ahr filamn tr t0jonaf fagfn). Thus, judging by the material described, Siyah-gales is undoubtedly a cattle-breeding deity, a patron of the four-footed, mainly cattle, as seen from his particular attitude to cows, as well 8See G. S. Asatrian, "Al Reconsidered", Iran &amp; the Caucasus, vol. 5 (2001): 149-157.</page><page sequence="6">80 GARNIK ASATRIAN as from his name (gaieg means shepherd in the Near Caspian dialects, as will be seen below). Besides, like any chthonic deity, he also displays his demonic properties. That is clearly seen from the fact that although he is respected as the master of animals, he is also feared, and even restrained by apotropaic remedies and prayers as if for exorcising the evil spirit (such as the charm of twigs on the cow's forehead, drawing a circle with an iron tool, pronouncing the name of God when releasing the cow from entanglement, and so on). Besides, when the animal is too annoying, it can be cursed using the name of Siyah-galers": "Let Siyah-gales hit you" (EMr SiyMh-,osles tore bezene). In all appearances, we are dealing here with an initially theriomorphic deity, as is indicated by some curious details in our collected material, primarily that Siyah-gA1es appears at times as a deer, or in the company of a large deer, his favourite. His image as an old man clad in black hides is also an indication of the originally theriomorphic nature of Siyah-gales. And in this case, taking the best cow as a reward for his help to the hunter, he may well take it with the purpose of courting: why not? It could be assumed that in the original myth Siyah-g3Jes was featured as a black bull (cf. his partcular bias toward the cows) and was exclusively the master of domestic animals, cattle especially. And his appearance in the form of a deer, along wvith a wide sphere of functions, may be the result of a secondary contamination with the image of a no longer extant deity from the folk beliefs, the patron of forest and hunting. Moreover, at least nominally, Siyah-gales is unambiguously "the herdsman of cattle". However, still, it is more probable that in his current image Siyah- gales is, apart from other things, an Iranian cognate or analogue of the Greek Pan, the god of forests and grasslands, the patron of shepherds, herds and hunters, a somewhat compound character. As to the hyperbolised share of the cow in the Siyah-gales myth, it may result from the particular conceptualisation of this animal, by virtue of cattle breeding being the major form of economic activity, as the symbol of prosperity, the world of useful animals and cattle, noted in the Iranian popular outlook since very early times.9 9 See, e.g., W. Geiger, OstiramschetulturimAlternum, Erlangen, 1882: 343 et sq.</page><page sequence="7">THE LORD OF CAITLE IN GILAN 81 Anyway, the original theriomorphism of Siyah-g.les is indisputable, whether he is a black bull, a deer or even a mountain goat. 10 One of perhaps the most interesting details of the concept of Siyah-gales is the attribute of "black" (siyfah is "black" in Persian and Near Caspian dialects) within his name. Although his blackness is never emphasised except for the remote mention of the dark complexion of one of the hypostases of the deity, one still cannot doubt that in the original myth he was a black being, which is quite natural: the colour black, beside its sacral character, is on the whole one of the attributes of chthonic creatures. At the heart of the whole range of symbolic meanings of the black colour is the major denomination of the earth and what it contains and what is going to grow out of it. Blackness as an indication of link with the soil is an important characteristic of deities and demons of fertility and vegetation. It is not accidental that in the Old Greek tradition the goddess of Earth is called Fr JiEXatva, "Black earth". Also thought to be dark-skinned are the Hindu goddesses Durga and Kali. I" Therefore, it is logical that black is the attribute of the sexual instinct, eroticism and tranquillisation. The black magic rope donated to the good shepherds does symbolise this; that is, it is intended for taming the disobedient animals and stimulating their fertility.'2 10 On the early, so-called animal substrate of the anthropomorphic gods, see W. Burkert, Greek Relgion, Harvard, 1998: 64-66. 1 On the symbolism of the colour black in different traditions, seeJ.J. Meyer, Trilogie aldndLscherMachte undFeste der Vegetation, Bd I-Ill, Zurich-Leipzig, 1937: Bd I: 61-63, 73, 83-85; Bd II: 42, 160; Bd III: 208-209, 220. This is also the symbol of the feminine origin, in contrast to the male origin, which is red. 12 Incidentally, the name of the deity or spirit of wind in the Yazidi mythology is Baral meaning "black wind" (cf. Arm. dial. sev klami "tempest", lit. "black wind"). The black colour is also symbolically meaningful in magic. The blood of a black hen, black feathers of a crow, and/or the parts of the body of a black cat have all been essential components of the materia magica in Armenia. Associated with the black cat are many magic concepts and folk beliefs in the whole Near East, as well as in Europe. The black dog has an important cultic connotation in the Yazidi culture, as well as among the Zazas of Anatolia, where even the black oak is considered sacred (see G. S. Asatrian, "The Holy Brotherhood", Iran and the Caucasus, vol. III-IV (1999-2000): 83-84; T. Gilbert, "Note sur les sects dans le Kurdistan", Journal Asiatique, Septieme serie, tome 2 (1873): 393; r.

We naturally do not consider here the later re-evaluations of this colour carrying an unambiguously negative load, as the sign of mourning, an ominous svmbol of the realm of darkness in contrast to the illumination of knowledge, and so on.</page><page sequence="8">82 GARNIK ASATRIAN Thus, "black" is a typical epithet for Siyah-gales, the deity, with its image, function and sphere of activity directly linked to the animal and vegetable world, hence with the earth. This is undoubtedly a classical example of a chthonic god with dual characteristics, incorporating both a divine and a demonic nature. In the concept of punishment it is to be noted that Siyah-gales knocks the cow's horns in the earth so that her legs stick out. That item is noted in 'Abdoli and in our materials. It is curious that nearly all informants, even those with little knowledge of the Siyah-gales myth, put a special emphasis upon this item as if to underscore its importance. Here, there is most probably some metaphor meaning possibly a loss of some propertv, perhaps fertility, or some other thing with regard to the earth. As to the ban on carrying and selling, or even drinking, milk at night, that is a common ban encountered among many nations on carrying out the vitally important items at night. For example, it is not allowed to take fire from the home to neighbours at night; the same is true of water. These two bans probably mean that the prosperity (barakat) of the house will fade if such materials are removed. The origin of the name of the deity, rather of -gOes, for the first part of the compound is clear (from OIr. *syjwa- "black"), has so far remained obscure, although semantically it is well defined, meaning "the herdsman of neat cattle". As stated by an Iranian author: "At all places on the northern foothills of Alburz, from Gurgan to Mazandaran and up to Gilan, the shepherds breeding neat cattle and living by maldng dairy produce are called gles, while the shepherds breeding sheep and goats are known as kord or kurd Thus, kord (kuro) and gglef are two designations of two different concepts".'3 In all appearances, gOles is an early formation, going probably back to OIr. *gjwa-irax?aka- ("protector of cows"), cf. OInd. (Vedic) pas'u-raksi- "shepherd of sheep". OInd. rak4(iL, from IE *aleks-, which is also traced in Armenian aracem "to graze". The phonetic development, from the mentioned OIr. form to gAles, has perhaps taken place through *gfura? &gt; *goras &gt; gOlas. The symmetrical form of this important term, or the word denoting "shepherd of sheep", could have been reconstructed in Old 13 Hflsang-e Pulr-karim, "Dehkade-ye Sama(3)", Honar va mardom 98 (December 1970): 46.</page><page sequence="9">THE LORD OF CATTLE IN GILAN 83 Iranian as *pasu-raxs'a-ka-), which would normally give in Gilaki and Mazandarani *pazlej, or *pasles. However, this form has evidently been lost and replaced by kord(kura) or cappon. Characters similar to Siyah-gales have also been attested in the popular beliefs of other Iranian-speaking nations. In particular, for example, the patrons of cattle, protecting herds from wolves, thieves, the evil eye or disease, Gavane Zarza(n) and Mame-sivan among the Yazidis. The cultic image of the latter is more distinctly reflected in the prayer formulas, probably by virtue of the prevalence of small cattle breeding among the Yazidis. Cf. Mame sivan pu?trvnne taba-"Let Mame-sivan protect you" or Duae Mame sivan sar mJli taba-"Let Mame-sivan's blessing be over your house", and so on. Moreover, the name of Mame-sivan has become an eponym for certain families of the Pirs (a Yazidi religious caste), as well as a toponym, the name of a village in Sheikhan, a major Yazidi shrine also called Mlinor Lalesh (by analogy to Lalesh, the main religious centre and the place of pilgrimage for the Yazidis). The cultic significance of Mame-sivan and Gavane Zarza(n) is easily traced during the Yazidi New Year (A'yda sar-sake) celebrated on the first Wednesday in April (Old Style). Put in the dough of a large New Year pie-kuluee sare sVeJ (or to/k-e sare sAie)-is a bead or a coin. The pie is cut into pieces destined for individual deities, as well as to members of the family, excluding the infants unable to make out a benefactor from sin: xer a guna. The pie is distributed among Xata-j ot (lit. "furrow, a strip made by the plough"), the spirit protecting agriculture, Xudane-male, the spixit of the house, augmenting prosperity, Mame-sivan and Gavane Zarza(n), patrons of small cattle and neat cattle respectively, Malxwe-male, Master of the house, Kavanya-male, Mistress of the house, and so on. Depending on who gets the bead, one of the deities will show favour to the house next year, or someone in the family will be particularly fortunate. '4 Another interesting legend has also been preserved concerning Gavane Zarza(n): once Sheikh 'Adi (one of the three main figures of the Yazidi pantheon) received the members of his community, each one coming with a proper tribute, getting the blessing and the relevant authority. Gavane Zarza(n), being a poor shepherd, brought the Patriarch a barley loaf, the only thing that he could 14 Recorded from Sheikh Djangoe Tahar, Talin region, Armenia.</page><page sequence="10">84 GARNIK ASATRIAN find at his home. However, having approached the Sheikh's chamber, he felt ashamed and stood dejectedly hiding his gift under his garments. However, the second-sighted Sheikh 'Adi addressed him with the words "Do not fear, your modest gift is for me of more value than a whole cow", and he blessed the shepherd: "Go and be from now on the protector of cows, let your patronage be over the herds of my nation for ever and ever".'5 Lurs also have a patron of cattle called Namad-kal (possibly, "old man in a felt hat"; the Lurs and the Bakhtiaris wear cauldron- shaped high hats made of felt, the favourite headgear of all the male population in Luristan). According to the legend popular among the nomads of Eastern Luristan, Namal-kal, the mighty herdsman, protects cattle from wild beasts and thieves, brings stray animals to the house of their master and guards the herds of righteous shepherds in their absence.'6 Curious in this range is also the image of Tavri-chilut (lit. "naked (man) of the cattle"), noted among the Armenians of the Van area. According to the legend, Tavri-chilut (Tavri-c`;lut) wanders in the villages in the shape of a silent naked man sending a plague upon the cattle. This spirit holds out against the sign of the cross. The only salvation from Tavri-chilut is obtained by offering the cattle and a divine service in church. A complete redemption may be achieved by bringing to his favourite locality the sacred object of Van, the sacred spear currently preserved in the Monastery of Echmiadzin, which, according to the Armenian folk tradition, penetrated the body of the Saviour on the cross and which was then stored in the Varag Monastery near the city of Van.'7 With regard to the ambivalence of such images, it can be assumed that hidden under Tavri-chilut is most probably an earlier prototype of the patron of cattle, which has been lost. As far as I know, there have been no other more or less veritable parallels for cattle gods or patrons of animals attested among the Western Iranian peoples. Perhaps, of more interest are the Yazidi Mame-sivan and Gavane Zarza(n). From among the East Iranian world, the one that can be mentioned is Faelvzera, the Ossetian deity of small cattle, whose 15 Recorded from Dawreshe Tayar, Ashtarak region, Armenia. 16 See H. GfldarzT, Srmff-ye 'akyer-eiarq-eLorestan, Tehran, 1996: 103. 1' See Ubtipiti, "Up6w4", wui pwuihjnLunLpjnda IL utqqtuwqnnLpjnL, 8, bpbiwtG, 1978: 90.</page><page sequence="11">THE LORD OF CAITLE IN GILAN 85 name can be traced to the combination of the names of the Orthodox saints Flor and Laur.'8 In all the rest, highlighted as the patrons of cattle are as a rule Xizr and the prophets Moses (Musa) and Abraham, having a fairly undifferentiated function. Their role is actually reduced to protecting the cattle from wolves and other troubles, and ensuring the surplus stock and production of dairy. Due to them are also general formulas of appealing for grace to the animals. As to the Old Iranian period, the currently available texts have not yielded data on a special deity-the Lord of Cattle. The common indications of the Avestan GusTurvan (Pahl. gosurvan)'9 in connection with this subject seem to be irrelevant. Thus, Siyah-gales remains the only essential, and in every way authentic, figure of a cattle deity in the folk pantheon of the Iranian peoples. 18 B. A. RaAoeB, Ocemnuw. MoctIBa, 1971: 247-248; G.
