<plain_text><page sequence="1">478 International -7ournal of Ethics. DISCUSSIONS. PROFESSOR HUXLEY ON THE RELATION OF THE ETHICAL TO THE COSMIC PROCESS. THE position of Professor Huxley in the scientific world gives a commanding importance to his words, whenever he undertakes the scientific treatment of any subject; and when, as in the case of the Romanes address, he chooses a theme of general interest, it is the expected which happens, and there follows a wide-spread discussion, beginning among his scientific peers and filtering down to the gen- eral science-reading public. The interpretations put by different critics on the views advanced in this address are more or less at variance. In the opinion of Mr. St. George Mivart, Professor Huxley, in effect, surrenders the question of the origin of morals to the supernaturalists, since he is understood by Mr. Mivart, as well as by many others, to exclude the ethical process from the evolutionary process; and Mr. Mivart (in common with a great multitude without name) feels it neces- sary, when a natural explanation of any fact or phenomenon is not forthcoming, to fall back on a supernatural one. But it is not for a moment to be admitted that Professor Huxley has taken the position to which Mr. Mivart, in an article in the Nineteenth Century (presumptuously entitled, "Evolution in Pro- fessor Huxley") has so patronizingly welcomed him. The quota- tion from Seneca which serves as an introduction to the address is most significant in this connection: "For I sometimes go over into the enemy's camp, not so much as a deserter, but rather as a spy." Professor Huxley is.no deserter from the scientific ranks; but, in this excursion into the camp of the unscientific, he has, to a certain extent, assumed their point of view and adopted their language,-the better, perhaps, to convince them of the hopeless- ness of their philosophy. In the opinion of Mr. Leslie Stephen, who has made a most im- portant contribution to this discussion, Mr. Huxley has not fully expanded his meaning-a criticism almost as extraordinary as that of Mr. Mivart himself, for Mr. Huxley's literary style is crystal- clear, and he is wont to leave little room for doubt as to his views. Mr. Stephen also intimates that Mr. Huxley has misinterpreted</page><page sequence="2">Discussions. 479 certain of the facts with which the address deals (also an extraor- dinary criticism), and has thereby arrived at an awkward conclusion -a not too serious phrase, considering the gravity of the subject; and so far as Mr. Huxley's address is open to the interpretation of an attempt to show that the cosmic process, as unfolded in the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest, is opposed (in any deep and final sense) to the ethical process, it has been riddled through and through in Mr. Stephen's trenchant and lucid article in the Contemporary Revkw. But Mr. Huxley has shown, in the notes appended to the original address and in the prolegomena which accompany its publication in a permanent form, that the misinterpretation is on the part of Mr. Stephen, who appears not to have discovered the real bone of Mr. Huxley's contention. Mr. Herbert Spencer has also favored the public with a brief notice of the address in the form of a few notes in the A/henavm, in which he pertinently, albeit somewhat petulantly, asks, "1If the ethical man is not a product of the cosmic process, what is he a product of?" But the notes show that he, too, is off the scent, for Mr. Huxley states in a foot-note that "strictly speaking" (that is, scientifically speaking, thus admitting that he has been talking in the language of the Philistines, not in that of the children of light) " the ethical process is a part of the cosmic process"; and so he disposes of his three great critics in a single sentence. In fact, Professor Huxley himself, first or last, withdraws nearly all his own seeming attempts at putting the ethical process on any other than the cosmic basis. Does the address represent a courteous though futile struggle to adjust modern science to the atmosphere in which the address was delivered ? Or is it a covert attempt, on Professor Huxley's part, to wrest the scientific scriptures to the destruction of what he re- gards as the social heresies of certain of his scientific peers ? Whatever the explanation of the apparent contradictions of the address, it is the object of this discussion to find, if possible, the real kernel of Professor Huxley's argument. There are probably two chief causes of the disagreements which exist among those who are deeply interested in the subject of morals. First, there is a difference of view as to the real nature of morals,- a difference arising from a different conception of the origin and basis of morality. Thus, Matthew Arnold says: " We must ever trim between what we ought and what we must ;" but it seems to me plain that there</page><page sequence="3">480 International journall of Ethics. can be no conflict between necessity and duty, that compulsion destroys the moral quality of an act; he must needs go whom a certain person drives. But Mr. Arnold's words imply a conception of the moral law as an absolute law, not subject to modification by circumstances, and the fulfilment of this law is held to be only ideally possible. Thus the command, " be ye perfect," is scarcely taken seriously, even by those who accept it as authoritative. The mere statement of the view of the moral law as an absolute law sufficiently indicates the opposite view,-viz., that morality, like everything else with which we are acquainted, is relative. A second cause of disagreement is a difference in conception of the place of morals in the cosmic order,-in the individual and the social life. Morality is not in itself an end; it is rather a means to certain higher ends, which may be broadly stated as the completest attain- able realization of the possibilities of our being. He who makes a cult of bodily health, of becoming a fine animal, is an object of contempt to the serious; but only slightly less puerile is the ambi- tion of becoming moral as an end and object in itself. In the old Calvinistic creed, "mere morality" was derided as a "filthy rag" in comparison with the sense of redeeming love experienced by the repentant sinner; and there is a germ of scientific truth in this, as in the more formal dogmas of Calvinism, many of which are founded in the nature of things,-in the cosmic process,-and are false only so far as they are clothed with anthropomorphism. The highest type of man does not live morally as a duty merely, but as the only tolerable mode of living, and as essential to the realization of his highest potentialities as a physical, emotional, and intellectual being. The laws of personal morality are thus the laws of physical and psychical health; and just as physical health depends on the right kind of adjustment to the physical environ- ment, so, also, social morality consists in a certain kind and degree of harmony between the individual life and the social environment. The nature of the environment will thus determine, to a certain extent, the kind of action which will be moral. There is undoubtedly more or less of conflict between the in- terests of the individual and those of society as a whole; but Pro- fessor Huxley has probably put it too strongly in saying that the practice of that which is ethically best,-what we call goodness or virtue,-involves a course of conduct in all respects opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence,</page><page sequence="4">Discussions. 481 since self-assertion is the essence of the cosmic process and un- mitigated self-assertion,-pure egoism,-is incompatible with social morality. Now, while it must be admitted that there is a certain antagonism between an advantageous egoism and the degree of altruism which society demands, this is by no means a unique situation,-it is not peculiar to the moral life. There is, in fact, a constant antagonism between every living body and its physical environment; and the struggle for existence consists in the attempt not only to resist the influence of injurious conditions, but to achieve such an adjust- ment to all the conditions as shall result in an actual advantage to the individual; and this principle, applied to social morality, in- volves an advantage to society as well as to the individual. Social morality is not then purely altruistic. The ethical man, no less than the physical man, must adjust himself to his milieu; and the result of the struggle is the same in both cases, viz., survival of the fittest. Could anything be more moral, more beneficent in its results, than this? What do those who object to the survival of the fittest desire ? The survival of all, perhaps. But this is not merely to want the earth but more than the earth, since our planet is limited, both in area and productiveness, and will not support an unlimited amount of life. Moreover, the survival of all would defeat the whole scheme of progressive development, which not only results in the weeding out of the less successful, but actually depends on the production of more than can be provided for. This is a positive condition of progress; the opposite condition of the preservation of all, were it possible, must inevitably result in the deterioration and eventual extinction of the species-facts that even the idealist cannot be allowed to overlook. But the real difficulty probably lies in the fact that nature's fittest is not always pleasing, is some- times non persona grata, to the philanthropist, and he incontinently rejects the cosmic product; while nature, meantime, ever reciprocal, brings the pet of Philanthropos to grief. Fitness varies with the point of view; fitness for survival under water,-e.g., is anatomico-physiological; in a society of cannibals or at Newport, something quite other than this, although it might, in the former case, be a question of muscle and fat and, hence, physiological. I will not attempt to state the case for Newport, but probably heredity, and, hence, evolution may have something to do with it.</page><page sequence="5">482 International Y7ournal of Ethics. Many of Professor Huxley's statements imply that the struggle for existence is uncompromisingly opposed to even the smallest degree of altruism, the essential quality of which is self sacrifice; but this is to make both the doctrine of the struggle for existence and the principle of altruism too simple by far. In the higher phases of human life, the struggle for existence is not a mere matter of feeding and mating, although these elements of the struggle are still powerful and not to be ignored; it is not a mere question of physical strength, although this, too, is an important means to the desired ends; neither is it, on the other hand, purely a question of altruism, not even of the degree of altruism required for social morality, although this is an influential factor in the total problem; but the struggle involves the whole nature of man, living not the isolated life of a hermit, but in a community of men having de- sires and needs similar to his own, and with whom he is therefore in sympathy. Professor Huxley, indeed, admits this (though only in a foot-note) when he says, again strictly speaking, that " the social life and the ethical process by virtue of which it advances towards perfection are part and parcel of the general process of evolution;" and he com- pares the ethical process to the " governor" in a steam-engine, itself a part of the mechanism. That altruism, the passion for humanity, is entirely consistent with the utilitarian doctrine, and the general principle of the sur- vival of the fittest cannot, I believe, be seriously questioned; but, like every other passion, it is likely to become excessive, and thus to defeat its own ends. Man is a part of nature, and the explanation of his whole being is to be sought in the movement-the flux-of nature; and if Pro- fessor Huxley seriously intends the exclusion which some of his statements imply, it behooves him to extend his definition of the cosmos. In a most suggestive little excerpt entitled, " Musings on the Matterhorn," Professor Tyndall, harking back to the nebulous haze in which our solar system is believed to have had its origin, asks,- " Did that formless fog contain potentially the sadness with which I regarded the Matterhorn? Did the thought, which now ran back to it, simply return to its primeval home? If so, had we not better recast our definition of matter and force? For if life and thought be the very flower of both, any definition which omits life and thought must be inadequate, if not untrue."</page><page sequence="6">Discussions. 483 So, any definition of the evolutionary process which omits the ethical process is manifestly inadequate. But Professor Huxley reiterates this idea with an emphasis that is almost dogmatic. " Let us understand once for all," he says, " that the ethical progress of society depends not on imitating the cosmic process-still less in running away from it-but in combating it." Now this, like many other contested passages, expresses (and that by implication rather than directly) a partial untruth; for the com- bating of the cosmic process belongs to all phases of life, being nothing more nor less than the struggle for existence, and is not therefore peculiar to the ethical process, as implied by Mr. Huxley. The progress of the vertebrate animal from the cold-blooded to the warm-blooded type, eg., depended on combating that element of the cosmic process which tends to keep the animal temperature at about the level of the temperature of his environment; but this tendency has been successfully combated-outwitted, so to speak- in the warm-blooded animal by the development of a special mech- anism by means of which external cold excites the production of an increased amount of heat in the body with a diminished rate of loss, while external warmth produces the opposite effects, diminishing heat production and providing for continued heat-loss. But does this successful resistance to certain unfavorable conditions of the environment put the development and mode of action of the heat- regulating mechanism outside the range of evolution ? On the con- trary, it is not only one of the elements of survival, but is directly promotive of a higher grade of life,-it marks an important advance in the animal series. So the progress as well as the survival of the social animal, whether ape or man, is promoted by a due develop- ment of the social instincts; and the altruistic sentiment is as dis- tinctly an outcome of the cosmic process as, e.g., the lifting of a weight by means of a derrick is the result of certain of the universal laws of matter, although the ascent of their weight is directly against gravity; and the thesis that the ethical process consists in combat- ing the cosmic process puts it, in effect, squarely on the same ground with the general struggle for existence; it is a part of the struggle. The antithesis implied in the much-quoted statement that " the ethical process is directed not so much to the survival of the fittest as to the fitting of as many as possible to survive," is a mere trick of words, a case of yielding to the temptation of saying something pithy and pointed,-an art in which Mr. Huxley is an adept. But</page><page sequence="7">484 International Yournal of Ethics. there is no real antithesis of ideas in this apparent antithesis of phrases. There is implied rather an extension of survival by means of an extension of a fundamental method of securing survival; the same as that, e.g., which prompts the mother-animal to protect her young;-it is an extension of the individual struggle for self-pre- servation to others with whom the individual is in sympathy,-a method which appeared long before the human stage of develop- ment was reached, and, therefore, does not come within the limits of the ethical process as conceived by Professor Huxley. He admits this view in saying, " It may seem an audacious proposal to pit the microcosm against the macrocosm, and to set man to subdue nature to his higher ends; but I venture to think that the great intellectual difference between the ancient times and our day lies in the solid foundation we have acquired for the hope that such an enterprise may meet with a certain measure of success." So might the mega- therium have soliloquized-had the reasoning faculty been suffi- ciently developed-on the probabilities of success in his struggle against the unfavorable conditions of his environment; there is nothing unevolutional in this. " Fragile reed as he may be, man is a thinking reed," says Pro- fessor Huxley, quoting Pascal; and " in virtue- of his intelligence, the dwarf bends the Titan to his will:" that is, he succeeds in the struggle,-in the higher social struggle as well as in the lower physical struggle. Professor Huxley's position is a conservative one towards what he describes as "modern speculative optimism and perfectibility of the species, reign of peace and lion and lamb transformation- scenes." He has slight sympathy with the enthusiast who antici- pates a social millennium, when each shall put his neighbor's in- terests before his own (to the probable detriment of both), and shall not even prefer one neighbor to another (a namby-pamby, colorless sort of existence). If egoism has its limitations in the very nature of things, so, surely, has altruism. The altruist must eat; the philanthropist must suffer competition, even in his philanthropy, since philanthropists themselves are not agreed as to what their less fortunate brothers most need. And so the struggle continues in the social as in the lower phases of life; the energies which animate the atoms of the cosmic dust " without haste, without rest," ply on, and the altru- istic life, the life of sympathy and love, emerges joyously from the ever-recurring flux.</page><page sequence="8">Discussions. 485 Professor Huxley expresses little doubt that they who would trace the origin of the moral sentiments, as of other natural phenomena, to the process of evolution, are on the right track; but he adds that as the immoral sentiments have no less been evolved, there is, so far, as much natural sanction for the one as the other, and that cosmic evolution is incompetent to furnish any better reason why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil than we had before. What better reason could be desired than that which exists in the very nature of what we call good and evil? Science has little to do with reasons in the a priori sense,-the reason is to be looked for in the result; and if the tactics of the thief and the murderer (who, as pointed out by Professor Huxley, follow nature just as much as the philanthropist) had proved satis- factory, we should pronounce them good, and, as a matter of fact, there are those among us to-day who have not yet found out to the contrary. But cosmic evolution, in the form of experience, has succeeded in satisfying some of us that "what we call good" is better than "what we call evil." It has developed in us a decided preference for it, especially in other people, and everybody insists that his neighbor shall tell the exact truth. But "good" and " evil" must be defined, and this is just what the cosmic process does for us; it brings out the working relations between egoism and altruism, and defines the limits of both. The final test of all action is the test of utility, the test of survival; but the formulation of the utilitarian principle, as of all general principles, must be a guarded one. Taken as a whole, I believe that the Romanes address stands acquitted in the main of the criticisms brought against it by Mr. Spencer, Mr. Stephen, and Mr. Mivart; but such analysis of the discourse as I have been able to make brings out two proposi- tions, or rather implications, which seem to be unsupported by fact, viz.: ist, That the necessity for combating the cosmic process is peculiar to the social-i.e., the ethical-phase of development when, in fact, it belongs to all phases, as the principle of the struggle for existence shows. 2d, That cosmic evolution affords no sanction of the ethical process, when, in fact, it fords the highes Lpossible sanction-the sanction of survival. In his final statement, however, Professor Huxley does not posi- tively exclude the sanctions of morality from the evolutionary</page><page sequence="9">486 International _7ournal of Ethics. process; rather he points out that it also sanctions immorality and crime; and this cannot be denied, since they also survive; the wicked flourish like a green bay-tree. The question then resolves itself into the following: Does evolu- tion tend towards the production of the ethical man as the highest type.? Is the ethical ideal the one towards which the race is striving ? Professor Huxley himself answers this question in the affirmative by comparing the influence of physiology, psychology, ethics, and political science in modifying the process of life and its manifesta- tions to that of astronomy, physics, and chemistry in their command over the course of non-human nature; and he says that it seems irrational to doubt that the former will work as great a revolution in the sphere of conduct as the latter have done in the material sphere-that he sees no limit to the extent to which intelligence and will may modify the conditions of existence, and that much may be done to change the nature of man himself. In other words, the ethical man has been and is to be still further developed by the same general process by which the physical man and material progress have been evolved,-viz., by the cosmic process. That the rain and the sunshine fall alike on the just and on the unjust is an old grievance, but one is not a little surprised fo find a man of Professor Huxley's calibre giving it fresh utterance. However, his address is not only a masterly setting forth of the world-treatment of the problem of good and evil in all ages, but, in the presentation of the problem from his own point of view, the address is both manly and tender; and the ethical ideal of life is held up as that towards which the race is bound to strive. But Professor Huxley, in common with a considerable contingent of society, recognizes the fact that the moral, no less than the other interests of life, have a physical basis; and that philanthropic efforts which deal mainly with the superstructure, leaving the foundations undisturbed, are well-nigh, if not utterly, fruitless. The scientific view of the higher sociological questions may be, to a certain extent repulsive, and there are those who seem to fear an investigation of the basis and, I will add, the limitations of morals; but in the long run, in calculating the cosmic calendar, a philosophy founded on the facts of existence is the most satisfying as it is the most durable. Nevertheless, it appears to be a question, in many minds, as to how far it is desirable to know the whole truth of things. Caleb Plummer made his blind daughter blindly happy for awhile in the</page><page sequence="10">Discussions. 487 illusion of Gruff and Tackleton's generosity and their own com- fortable surroundings, but only to break her heart at last; and some poet (I forget his name-the individual is of small conse- quence in the cosmic process of appropriating his ideas) with a fine poetic, albeit deeply pessimistic touch, has said, "Whisper me, love, all things that are not true," implying that the illusions of life, the not-true things rather than the realities, are the sources of the highest satisfaction. But as it is a superficial view which considers that the real prizes of life are to be secured by pure egoism, and we regard murder (the grossest possible violation of the altruistic principle) not only as a crime but as a blunder, so we are compelled to believe that a true philosophy is best; that real nobility of soul does not fear to face the real universe; nay, more, that it draws its highest inspiration from an atmosphere of reality; that it is deeply enamoured of truth. But the bane of moral progress lies in the too common belief that our present knowledge of morals is final. Some lines of Browning's, if not poetical, are at least applicable to this point: "Man's the prerogative-knowledge once gained To ignore-find new knowledge to press for-to swerve In pursuit of no, not for a moment; attained, Why onward through ignorance dare and deserve, As still to its asymptote speedeth the curve !" The moral curve has not touched its asymptote; and if I have read Professor Huxley aright, this mathematical figure well expresses his position, since, though infinitely extended and ever approach- ing each other, the curve and its asymptote never meet. In the philosophy of Professor Huxley, it is idle to forecast a future in which the lion and the lamb shall lie down together, except in a sense in which the lion will have much the best of it. Such a state of things might appeal to some minds as an ideal state, though such a lion could hardly be regarded as an ideal lion; but we are safe in saying that it is not in the situation, not only from the point of view of evolution, but of morals itself, even were morals considered as sui genesis, and apart from the general mundane philosophy. An existence from which are eliminated the elements of struggle, of suppression of the inadequate as well as of the too self-assertive,- in short, of the physically, mentally, and morally unfit,-may have its attractions for the sentimentalist; but the attempt to work such</page><page sequence="11">488 International Yournal of Ethics. a scheme out of the materials at hand would be comparable to that of appending the doctrine of universal salvation to the Calvinistic creed,-the one completely wipes out the other. The cosmos is a stubborn fact; the cosmic process has un- doubtedly come to stay; and it devolves upon humanity to study it,-not merely as an intellectual gymnastic, but in the hope of finding, if possible, an inward reconciliation to it; being products of the cosmic process, we are bound to show it proper respect. In this reconciliation, moreover, is to be found the scriptural reward of peace to our souls,-a cure of the "Imad, impotent passion and outcry" described by Mrs. Ward as filling Marcella's heart at a certain stage of her career before she had settled down; Mr. Huxley has undoubtedly set forth a somewhat painful view of life-what Mr. Stephen (in language strikingly in contrast with that employed by Mrs. Ward) has described as an " awkward con- clusion"; but this may be fairly offset by another view. Mr. Stephen has pointed out that morality implies the develop- ment of certain instincts which are essential to the race, although they must, in an indefinite number of cases, be injurious to the individual-as when the mother dies in defence of her child. But who is to judge as to what is, on the whole, injurious to the indi- vidual? In the example cited, let us appeal from Mr. Stephen to the mother herself; and if all, or even a modicum, of what has been said on this subject be true, she will tell us that a single year of motherhood is worth a cycle of childless existence. The crown of martyrdom has been joyfully worn in more than one good cause, and the example cited is only one of many illustrations of a thesis well worthy of development,-viz., that even the individual (who is for the most part represented as playing the role of a martyr in the evolutionary scheme), that the individual, caught in the vortex of the cosmic process, has no adequate cause of complaint; he has his compensations. I remember once having seen in one of our maga- zines a most instructive drawing which it might be well to have re- produced in considerable numbers and a copy sent to every college settlement in the country. The picture represented a ragged and reckless-looking colored boy playing with a tin can and a string; and a sympathetic, philanthropic, altruistic, ethic,-in short, cosmic -woman (well-dressed withal, and therefore one whose life must have been more or less of a burden) who, being moved to " do something" for the poor cosmic waif, introduced her efforts by asking-" How old are you, my little boy ?"</page><page sequence="12">Discussions. 489 "Wal," said the boy, "if you goes by what ma says, I's four; but if you goes by the fun I's had, I's a hunderd !" The mere consciousness of living is pleasurable; the entire group of sensations known as " bodily" is exhilarating; the special sen- sations, in proportion as they develop on the psychical side, become transcendently interesting; the deep delight of the fundamental emotions, the glow of psychical satisfaction which attends the cap- ture of the Q. E. D., the culmination of psychical happiness in the inspirations of genius are all good, and most of them come in some degree into the experience of all. But what are they in comparison with the abiding sense of justice, of honor and of duty, which sooner or later become, to some ex- tent at least, integral parts of every individuality ? Despair itself, when not purely an expression of some organic disturbance, is but a confession of failure of the realization of one's ideal; happy to have had that ideal! Whatever the outcome, struggle itself is joyous; from it comes sometimes the defeat which rouses the latent residue of energy necessary to a future success; and sometimes the sweetness of vic- tory-not necessarily the egoistic exultation in the overthrow of an enemy (although this also counts) but the finer conquests which be- long to the higher ranges of our complex cosmic-human nature- the ascendancy of sweet reason-the full flowering of the ethical man.
