The strength of this book lies not in the originality of its theory of religion as anthropomorphism but in its extensive critical examination of the role of anthro- pomorphism in human experience in general, including religion. The interpreta- tion of religious belief as anthropomorphism is as old as the early Greek philoso- phers and as fresh as Robin Horton's recent book, Patterns of Thought in Africa and the West (Cambridge, 1993; reviewed below, p. 310). Author Stewart Elliott Guthrie draws his inspiration from Hume, Feuerbach, Nietzsche, Freud, Piaget, and Horton, whose views he critically examines and extends, while largely dismissing those of Otto, Durkheim, Eliade, Tillich, and Geertz. As a theory of religion, anthropomorphism has, of course, not found fa- vor among theologians because it holds religious belief to be mistaken. Guthrie's view is no different. He finds anthropomorphism to be central to religion, and he takes religious belief to be an illusion. Nevertheless, he sees anthropomor- phism to be an extraordinarily plausible and effective way of relating to the world. Most of the book is a brilliant exploration of the pervasiveness of anthropomor- phism in the human perception of the world, the place of anthropomorphism in the arts, and the role it has played and continues to play in philosophy and science. The case for anthropomorphism as a "theory" of religion is much less clear. In this postmodern age, any scholar who tries to urge a theory on his colleagues needs to explain why a theory is needed at all. The fact that no acceptable defini- tion of religion has been found and that all explanations of religions are defective does not prove daunting to Guthrie. This is because he holds to the now rather quaint positivist view of theory as providing "a widely accepted definition" of "religion in general" that explains the universal "sources" and "causes" of reli- gious belief. Nowadays, all the foundational concepts of this old procedure are seriously open to question, and unfortunately Guthrie does not attend to the issues here. Which scholars should adjudicate such supposedly neutral and uni- versally valid definitions? Is there any such thing as "religion in general"? Do all religions have the same "sources" or "causes"? Equally important is the question 302</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews of what one is supposed to do with the anthropomorphic theory. For example, how does it help me understand, say, Yoruba gods any better? The Yoruba al- ready recognize that many of their gods were formerly living human beings. The task for Yoruba scholars is to understand the different personalities of these gods, how they serve as ways of understanding human life, and how they express cer- tain Yoruba moral and philosophical concepts. Anthropomorphism is only the beginning of this interpretive task, not its conclusion, and it is certainly unhelpful in rejecting Yoruba belief as an illusion. For the humanistic/postmodern scholar of religion, it is not the truth or falsity of religion that matters but its meaning in the life and imagination of religious people. For many scholars, the only way to see this is to abandon the attempt to achieve a God's-eye perspective, which foundationalists such as Guthrie propose, and attend to the diversity and integ- rity of religious systems as much as possible, each within its own cultural and theological setting. We should not be concerned with how a religion exemplifies a general theory so much as how we can render intelligible certain religious ideas and behavior within wider cultural settings. This is the humanistic scholar's search for meaning, not the foundationalist's quest for the "real" sources and causes of religious illusions. BENJAMIN C.
