<plain_text><page sequence="1">HORIZONS OF LANGUAGE WYLIE SYPHER In his 1920 collection of poems T. S. Eliot, repeating St. John, wrote "In the beginning was the Word." By 1961 George Steiner entitled his Kenyon Review essay "Retreat from the Word." Ferdinand de Saus sure's linguistic science had intervened to reduce literature and criti cism of literature to a semiotics that has become forbiddingly technical in direct ratio to its modernity. In view of the continuing and disputa tious redefinitions of the modern, modernism, modernity, one hesitates to use the term, which is a semantic quagmire. Yet for present purposes can we perhaps agree with Stephen Spen der about the difference between the contemporary and the modern? Contemporary writers may be disaffected with their culture without rejecting its premises or values. But the modern, while aware of the contemporary, has an alternative vision based on other premises. Ar nold Bennett was contemporary; Eliot was modern as well as contempo rary. Usually the index of this difference is the writer's consciousness, his concern, about his use of his medium, a stimulus to self-criticism.

First there comes a new sensitivity to motifs hitherto ignored as violations of academic expectations. Such unorthodoxy appeared in "realism" and early impressionism?Courbet's Funeral at Ornans and Manet's D?jeuner sur Vherbe or Olympia, which is conventional in composition but schismatic (even parodie) in motif. Such painters are akin to novelists like George Eliot, Gissing, or Hardy in breaking with traditional content but without great innovation in technique. Actually and almost unintentionally they often did use their medium in new ways but did not try to exploit its extreme possibilities. They were more given to novelty of subject than to scrutiny of then vehicle for representing. From this first generation of moderns spring the postmoderns whose revolutionary intent is expressed in their experimental manipulation of their medium, devising a new aesthetic of an autonomous vocabu lary and pigment. This aesthetic became doctrinal in Baudelaire and the symbolists, then in Eliot, Pound, Duchamp, in Joyce, Gide, Cage, the Bauhaus, and masters of the 1950s and 60s. Almost obsessively such postmoderns have been studious of the possibilities and limits of their medium, advancing propositions that often are the very motifs of their work. Sometimes they pressed the exploitation of their medium to ex haustion, as did Mallarm? in his unwritten poetry and Duchamp in his bottle-rack?a mockery of Art. Rauschenberg remarked that his painting operates in the gap be tween art and life. The irony and risk of operating in this gap are illustrated by Duchamp, who, when his Large Glass was cracked in transit, simply said it had returned to reality; but when he was asked where the glass was before it was cracked, he only laughed. Already Duchamp was occupying the gap that concerns deconstructionist crit ics in their analysis of texts based on a paradox: namely that if lan guage is only a phantom reference to anything outside itself, then writing is about writing, demonstrating the literariness of literature, leaving little to interpret except the exercise of its own medium. At this point of exhaustion of meaning art turns against itself in aesthetic suicide, and there comes a reaction in postpostmodernism?a return to past art in the form of a knowing parody. London now has a group of young painters amusing themselves by repainting Velasquez's Rokeby Venus and Manet's Olympia with wry profanity, which may soon deplete its possibilities. Something of the same highbrow kitsch appears in Fowles's French Lieutenant's Woman, a novel requiring the reader's acquaintance with the mechanism of earlier novels. The photo realist (but illusionist) paintings by Estes are a recoil from the explora tory minimalist abstractions of the sixties and seventies. So the post</page><page sequence="3">ARTS AND LETTERS 577 postmodern closes a cycle with its own irony as tradition mocks itself in derision of the medium. This cyclic pattern has some bearing on Wilde's Horizons of Assent, a study of three sorts of irony evident in modern and postmodern phases that refine the categories defined by D. C. Muecke and Wayne Booth. Wilde's three modes or zones of irony, seen in the novels by Forster, Virginia Woolf, Ivy Compton-Burnett, and Donald Barthelme, are termed mediate, disjunctive, and suspensive, often interfusing as they do in Forster. Mediate irony, found in early moderns and the (old) New Criticism, recognizes the paradoxes and contradictions in litera ture but tries to reconcile or harmonize them by imagining an order from which we have lapsed. Disjunctive irony abandons this mediation by stressing the impossibility of either accepting or controlling the chaos and unintelligibility in which we live?a situation approaching "absolute irony" where at the core of modernism extreme polarities are held in Manichean balance. The fragmentation of the world in post modern suspensive irony is more radical still, because writers like Bar thelme and Gass have ceased any quest for a lost paradise or an alter native domain and tolerate the essential randomness, contingency, and absurdity in things as they are. Suspensive irony lacks any vision of another order that Wilde calls ?nironic. By means of this possibly overdiscriminated scheme Wilde in his parenthetic manner examines how Forster and Virginia Woolf slide from one to another mode of irony?from anxiety to a postmodern "aesthetics of surface." In this aesthetics of surface Compton-Burnett falls back on language as a means of showing that things are exactly what they seem; thus she anticipates the chosisme of the recent French novel. In the neutral language of the Auden generation Wilde detects the phenomenalist conviction that the surface is the core. The abiding modern attraction to the surface at the expense of depth (the third di mension and implied "meaning") suggests how this reduction of rhet oric corresponds to minimalist painting. It marks not only a zero degree of writing but also a zero degree of commitment, an irony in a frag mented world needing interpretation. The irony heightens in the curiously irresponsible willingness of Barthelme and Gass not to make sense, their quasi-comic revision of the anguish in Kafka's unintelligible world. Their suspensive irony seeks only "small satisfactions," and their accommodations to the ab surd are easier than in Beckett. Whereas Kafka feels that he must some how control or at least understand his disjunctive world, Beckett, who troubles us, is himself untroubled enough to take the attitude Com ment c'est?That's how it is. Resigning any effort to understand, suspensive irony leads the post moderns to retreat to exercises in the medium?that is, to the surface,</page><page sequence="4">578 ARTS AND LETTERS for depth is illusory. Wilde's suspensive irony is a way to cut our losses. Since meaning is only in language, the innocence (or the complicity in innocence) of the surface, as in Jasper Johns's painted numbers, is medium-fetishism even if less dazzling than the virtuoso verbal surface of Finnegans Wake. What seems obvious is actually mysterious: as Heidegger said, the ordinary is really extraordinary. Barthes agrees. This phenomenological posture is exploited by Resnais and Robbe Grillet. Gass finds a world within the word, and Barthelme prefers to write only fragments amid the disarray of human experience, while Pynchon offers his disjunctive collage. Pop Art is a demotic aesthetic of surface. The classic discussion of surface and depth is Joseph Frank's 1945 essay "Spatial Form in Modern Literature," now the axis of nine rang ing commentaries collected in Spatial Form in Narrative. Frank's origi nal aim was to dispute Lessing's assumption that literature, being read sequentially, must be a temporal art in contrast to painting, where we see the composition synoptically at once?spatially a whole. Following Wilhelm Worringer's Abstraction and Empathy, Frank argued that by the principle of reflexive reference (that is, self-reference) a novel or poem is also read as a synchronie composition of parts framed as a whole and is therefore spatial as well as temporal. As Frank Kermode proposed, a sense of an ending endows a narrative with meaning, since interpretation requires a retrospective view, as does the irony of a tragic action. Reading is synoptic when in the reader's perception the ending inheres in the beginning, the future in the instant. Frank ac cepted the principle of coexistence and relativity as literary, and in emphasizing the shift from temporal to spatial organization he was sus taining Saussure's shift in linguistics from diachronic to synchronie (structural) interpretation. This shift meant the death of realism. The novel, like recent abstract painting, has refused the "story" unfolding in a "plot" and instead establishes a fictional order that is a figuration on the surface, sacrific ing depth for design. As Frank saw, The Waste Land or Ulysses re places sequence with a composition that seems occult or paratactic but is thematically structured. As Whitehead wrote, the whole enters into each of the parts, and interpretation of a text must, as in structuralist criticism, identify the synchronie skeleton beneath the episodic dia chronic movement. Reading must discern the total composition that redeems narrative progress from time into space?a two-dimensional or flat space. Robbe-Grillet has noted that we now live in a flat dis continuous world. In 1945 Frank did not realize how his demotion of temporal in be half of spatial configuration relates to the modernist aesthetic of crisis in which the signifier (the sign) becomes more important than what is signified. In a recent essay William Gass sees the modern novel as "a</page><page sequence="5">ARTS AND LETTERS 579 struggle between data and design" because its medium is the word, and the word "is closer to its sense than to its reference." The older mimetic, realist novel was "fact-infested": only lately have we seen that by words a novel erects a world that Worringer would call tran scendental, denying the third dimension. The modernist aesthetic thus turns from realist narrative to a poetic of fiction that is a self-reflexive construct, whether in words or pigment, making reference to nothing beyond its own language. Any commitment to realism is waived in an autonomous, an essentialist, exhibition of the medium reaffirming itself as art?for art. Heidegger said that language is the house of Being. Witness stories by John Barth and the critics' accepting writing as writing. The new formalism, supported by structuralism and intertextualism, has brought the novel, together with minimalist painting and sculpture, to a postmodern exhaustion suggesting another irony: in our concern to exploit the medium we create a verbal world exactly while semiotics and deconstruction indicate that words make only undependable ref erence to what is beyond themselves. According to Derrida words are mere traces of our encounter with things. Here is a version of the ro mantic irony that insists on the illusory nature of its own artistry. Semi otics can show that language opens a breach between itself and ac tuality, confirming that all writing is a deception, if not a banality, in its impotent pseudoreferences. The implications of Frank's attention to surface design lead toward an acceptance of the literariness of lit erature and an aesthetic in which the author, along with what he wants to refer to, disappears behind his medium. Frank is not to blame, and the editors of these nine essays rightly claim that Frank has aroused a discussion bridging linguistics, struc turalism, and hermeneutics, not to mention the myth criticism that oc casions Gould's daunting book so carefully entitled Mythical Intentions in Modern Literature. For it is the intention behind literature that brings Gould's argu ment into focus. If we think that language is autotelic, lacking clear reference to what is beyond itself, there arise questions about relations between language and the numinousness of myth. Mustering a formi dable phalanx of linguistic critics from the Russian formalists through Jakobson, Barthes, Derrida, and Lacan at his most hermetic, Gould daringly proposes that "we can locate the motive for myth in the con ditions of language itself" in its "indefinite play of signification." Myth is a defensive gesture intended to fill the gap between signifier and the signified. The numinous quality of myth is ascribable precisely to the inadequacy of language in designating exactly what happens in the world to which it refers. Therefore all language is metaphor, which is the most powerful instrument of the unconscious and the conscious. Gould explains that he is concerned not with any particular myths but</page><page sequence="6">580 ARTS AND LETTERS only with mythicity, the psychological and linguistic intentions de termining the language that "always reveals an unbridgeable gap be tween a signifier and a signified." The inevitability of metaphor is caused by this gap, the void, the Nothing that is absence. He ventures to suggest that Jakobsons alleged polarities of metaphor versus metonymy are deceptive: in every metaphor there is implied a metonymy that is absent because metaphor "must always strive toward the clarity of exact substitution." Through the play of every metaphor runs an irony?the "yearning for completeness inherent in the absent metonymy." Just as in existential commitment to action there lurks a sense of the Nothing behind Being, so behind all our language is a shortfall indicating the limits of that language, the void occupied by the writer, and the source of the numinous we seek in myth. Formulating a paradox in a metaphysics of the Nul, Gould reaches a height of postmodern self-criticism concerning use of the medium: 'Words mean in their absence of meaning." What a text means to say results from our obsession "for rescuing meaning from its absence." Thus Gould endorses Derrida's belief that the reference of words is only a kind of erasure, a mere trace. Or, as Barthes notes, we can lib erate the object from its mystery by naming it; but if we accept it in its full weight, we only return it to its mystic state?a point already made by Ernst Cassirer about the primitive mind's endowing the object with its mana, its potency. Gould reaches the same conclusion by way of semiotic science; our "awe at language" makes writing an orphie art. The inconclusiveness of the word means that Joyce, Eliot, and Law rence, each closely examined by Gould, succeed mythically only when they are not doctrinal or promoting an ideology (Derrida has said "I am trying, precisely, to put myself at a point so that I do not know any longer where I am going"). With such agnosticism Gould ventures to question Jungian archetypes as mythical; the mythical arises from the inability of language to devise reliable images, nor can images become ideas. Thus Gould would dispel the mystique of m?ndalas and the hinterland of the mind as sources of myth: "I do not want to appear to believe that one can dismiss Jungianism summarily," he says, yet "the unconscious defined in terms of the wonder-world' theory offers us little more than a grab bag of anthropomorphic meaning." Though Gould's interpretation of Lawrence and Eliot may be special pleading, we must respect his chapter on the mythic and the numinous even if he is confusing about fictions. He seems to take fiction only as a narrative or "story," saying that "myths and fictions are both narrative systems" although myth has a symbolic value. Yet a fiction is always potentially mythic "because both myth and literature function within a general theory of fictions." And evidently myths can be transformed into fictions. Gould may not see that the difference between myth and fiction ultimately depends upon the mode of belief with which each is</page><page sequence="7">ARTS AND LETTERS 581 held. What do we mean when we say "It's only a myth"? We imply doubt which arises from a conscious judgment. This dismissive use of myth is opposite to the approval conveyed when we say that a novel has mythical significance. The resolution of this opposition between the two uses of mythic lies not so much in language as in the credence determining each use of the term, its degree of credibility marking a subjective appraisal according to beliefs. Belief in turn depends upon the consciousness?or the unconsciousness?of the artifice of what is be ing said. We must question Gould's opinion that although "men make myths intentionally," these myths "are not believed in literally but symbolically." If we seek the numinous, myth is likely to be what I. A. Richards called a magical, anthropomorphic "belief in a world of Spirits and Powers which control events"?a belief contrary to scientific detach ment. By contrast a fiction, at least as defined by Hans Vaihinger, is a consciously posited and consciously held mental artifact devised as premise to whatever one wishes to affirm. The self-evident truths of American politics are, like Locke's State of Nature, consciously estab lished and consciously held fictions having their own numinousness. The mathematics of orthogonal perspective are fictions consciously imposed by the painter; and Mondrian's geometry is, like Wallace Stevens's Idea of an Order, a fiction. The allegiance of modern man is to fiction, not to myth as a projected animation. As Joseph Frank says, "So long as we remain within the realm of art, so long as fictions remain conscious fictions, we do not have to worry about myth and its dan gers." That is, dangers to modern intelligence because animation of our world is a willful regression to an unwarranted primitive naivete and uncritical belief. In this sense myth is a fiction that is deprived of our consciousness of its status as an artifact. If myth is anthropomor phic, the fiction is anthropocentric in its artifice, legitimately based?in the mind. The distinction transcends linguistics and involves older views of the numinous in myth which Gould may too easily dismiss. The opening of Hardy's Return of the Native regresses to animism as the twilit Egdon Heath embrowns itself, seeming to await some grim event. In what sense did Hardy believe this pathetic fallacy, which does have a numinous atmosphere? How did the Victorians believe the celestial domains mentioned in their hymns about Jerusalem the Golden? Were the pious aware that this pinchbeck numinousness was an artifice? The insufficiency of language may explain the numinous, but maybe Gould overlooks Nietzsche's notion of myth, which accommodates primitive unconsciousness. Nietzsche remarks: "Only a horizon ringed about with myths can unify a culture. . . . The images of myth must be the daemonic guardians, ubiquitous but unnoticed." Donald Davie has somewhere noted that we do not think mythically when we intend to</page><page sequence="8">582 ARTS AND LETTERS think mythically. But we can think fictions into being as constructs of the mind. We may ask whether Nietzsche's Dionysiac was fiction or myth. In any case its power was transmitted to a current in modernism that is traced by John Burt Foster, Jr., in Heirs to Dionysus. After an eminent ly reliable and encompassing review of Nietzsche's thought as it cul minated in "aesthetic naturalism" Foster considers the novels of D. H. Lawrence, Malraux, and Mann to prove in unrelenting detail that they are heirs to the Dionysiac and that Nietzsche with his "polaristic dual isms" and his response to "the emotional power of myth" broke with the past and belongs with the moderns. Gould's linguistic explanation of myth may minimize the Nietzschean "basic organic function" underlying the numinous in a Hardy?or a Wordsworth, whose language, as Wordsworth himself knew long be fore semiotics, did not phrase his natural piety. In Paradise Lost there is a certain overlap of myth and fiction: how did Milton believe in his Eden? And Hardy's sinister heath has a psychic impact attributable, like Wordsworth's motion and spirit, to a belief transcending language. Even if language be not the ground for myth, it can be undeniably symbolic, as is illustrated by Burton Pike in The Image of the City in Modern Literature. Pike says in his rapid survey that there are two cities : the physical city and the city created by words, the latter being symbol for all the contradictions in urban experience. For the city is both a community and a "paved solitude" that alienates; it is a cultural enclave and a deposit of historical guilt; it is a human arena and a waste land. It is born of language in writers of contrary vision: the cities of Baudelaire, Balzac, Dickens, Whitman, each with its own atmosphere and inhabitants who live in a spatial form that can be either a map or a labyrinth?or a trap. If myth arises from language, it appears at the margin where we do not know. In a fine summary Gould writes that "the conscious act of creating the text begins from negative knowledge, and always keeps in full view an inevitable incompletion: the circling of fact from silence to silence through a clamor of possible meaning." So what we do not know is the only thing that we know?a very Socratic axiom as writing folds in upon itself in a subversion where nothing is but what is not. Here is a postmodern aesthetic heroism, that of "knowing what cannot be said but must still be attempted." This heroism can be exhausting if writing is the only aim of writing. It is one thing to be aware of the infidelity of words; it is another thing to use language as the writing of a text for its own sake. Then the writer does not use language; language uses him. The word becomes a mystique, and interpretation (criticism) becomes a deconstruction seeking the unreadable, as reading becomes an agility in conjuring up possible subtexts echoing previous texts incestuously.</page><page sequence="9">ARTS AND LETTERS 583 Gould sees this danger, which ends in an inability to speak about anything, a semiotic vacuum that provokes the parodies in postpost modernism. After all, as David Bleich has argued, most texts have meanings available and negotiable for most readers. Inadequate as language may be referentially, its very ambiguous, metaphorical tex ture can fill some of the void between the self and the world, at least until semiotic aphasia sets in. At last it may be a problem in belief, and the virtue of Gould's argu ment is that it reduces the mystique of myth by affirming the essential ly symbolic faculty of language, making us aware of the psychological, social, and aesthetic intentions that control speaking and writing. This recognition sets horizons for the language that is a mask for silence.</page></plain_text>
